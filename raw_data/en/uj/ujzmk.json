Through this needs assessment, collaborative community partners have identified numerous health issues impacting individuals and families in the Delta County region. Several themes are prevalent in this health needs assessment - the demographic composition of the Delta County region, the predictors for and prevalence of diseases, leading causes of mortality, accessibility to health services and healthy behaviors. Results from this study can be used for strategic decision- making purposes as they directly relate to the health needs of the community. The study was designed to assess issues and trends impacting the communities served by the collaborative, as well as perceptions of targeted stakeholder groups. This study includes a detailed analysis of secondary data to assess information regarding the health status of the community. In order to perform these analyses, information was collected from numerous secondary sources, including publicly available sources as well as private sources of data. Additionally, primary d ata were collected for the general population and the at- risk or economically disadvantaged population. Areas of investigation included perceptions of the community health issues, unhealthy behaviors, issues with quality of life, healthy behaviors and access to medical care, dental care, prescription medication and mental -health counseling. Additionally, demographic characteristics of CHNA 2022 | Delta County 4 Collaboration for sustaining health equity 2022 respondents were utilized to provide insights into why certain segments of the population responded differently. Ultimately , the identification and prioritization of the most important health -related issues in the Delta County region were identified. The collaborative team considered health needs based on: (1) magnitude of the issue ( i.e., what percentage of the popula tion was impacted by the issue); (2) severity of the issue in terms of its relationship with morbidities and mortalities; (3) potential impact through collaboration. Using a modified version of the Hanlon Method, two significant health needs were identified and determined to have equal priority: Healthy Behaviors - defined as exercise, obesity, and food insecurity Behavioral Health - including mental health , substance abuse and access to counseling CHNA 2022 | Delta County 5 Collaboration for sustaining health equity 2022 I. INTRODUCTION Background The Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act (Affordable Care Act), enacted March 23, 2010, added new requirements for tax -exempt charitable hospital organizations to conduct community health needs assessments and to adopt implementation strategies to meet the community health needs identified through the assessments. This community health needs assessment (CHNA) takes into account input from specific individuals who represent the broad interests of the community served by OSF Saint Francis Hospital and M edical Group including those with special knowledge of or expertise in public health. For this study, a community health -needs assessment is defined as a systematic process involving the community, to identify and analyze community health needs and assets in order to prioritize these needs, create a plan, and act upon unmet community health needs. Results from this assessment will be made widely available to the public. This CHNA Report was approved by the OSF HealthCare System's Board of Directors on Jul y 25, 2022. The structure of the CHNA is based on standards used by the Internal Revenue Service to develop Form 990, Schedule H -Hospitals, designated solely for tax -exempt charitable hospital organizations. The fundamental areas of the community health needs assessment are illustrated below ( Figure 1 ). Figure 1 Collaborative Team and Community Engagement In order to engage the entire community in the CHNA process, a collaborative team of health -professional experts and key community advocates was created. Members of the collaborative team were carefully selected to ensure representation of the broad interests of the community. Specifically, team members included representatives from OSF Saint Francis Hospital and Medical Group , members of the Delta County Health Department, and administrators from key community partner organizations. Engagement occurred throughout the entire process, resulting in shared ownership of the assessment. The entire CHNA 2022 | Delta County 6 Collaboration for sustaining health equity 2022 collaborative team met in the first and second quarter of 2022. Additionally, numerous meetings were held between the facilitators and specific individuals during the process. Specifically, members of the Collaborative Team consisted of individuals with special knowledge of and expertise in the healthcare of the community. Note that the collaborative team provided input for all sections of the CHNA. Individuals, affiliations, titles and expertise can be found in APPENDIX 1 : MEMBERS OF COLLABORATIVE TEAM . Definition of the Community In order to determine the geographic boundaries for OSF Saint Francis Hospital and Medical Group , analyses were completed to identify what percentage of inpatient and outpatient activity was represented by Delta County. Data show that Delta County alone represents 8 6% of all patients for the hospital. In addition to defining the community by geograp hic boundaries, this study targets the at- risk population as an area of potential opportunity to improve the health of the community. Note that the at- risk population was defined as those individuals who were eligible to receive Medicaid based on the S tate of Michigan guidelines using household size and income level. Purpose of the Community Health- Needs Assessment In the initial meeting, the collaborative committee identified the purpose of this study. Specifically , this study has been designed to provide necessary information to health -care organizations, including hospitals, clinics and health departments, in order to create strategic plans in program design, access and delivery. Results of this study will act as a platform that allows health -care organizations to orchestrate limited resources to improve management of high -priority challenges. By working together, hospitals, clinics, agencies and health departments will use this CHNA to improve the quality of healthcare in Delta County. When feasible, data are assessed longitudinally to identify trends and patterns by comparing with results from the 201 9 CHNA and benchmarked with State of Michigan averages. Community Feedback from Previous Assessments The 2019 CHNA and implementation plan were made wid ely available to the community to allow for feedback. Specifically, the hospital posted both a full version and a summary version of the 2019 CHNA on its website. In order to encourage written feedback, the hospital specifically included a section labeled Share Your Feedback and provided instructions regarding how individuals from the community could provide comments to the CHNA. While no written feedback was received by individuals from the community via the available mechanism for the CHNA or implementation plan, verbal feedback was provided by key stakeholders from community -service organizations and incorporated as part of the collaborative process. 2019 CHNA Health Needs and Implementation Plans The 2019 CHNA for Delta County identified three significant health needs. These included: Healthy Behaviors, defined as healthy eating and active living, and their impact on obesity; B ehavioral Health, CHNA 2022 | Delta County 7 Collaboration for sustaining health equity 2022 including mental health and substance abuse; and Aging Issues, defined as population over 65 . Specific actions w ere taken to address these needs. Detailed discussions of goals and strategies to improve these health needs can be seen in APPENDIX 2 : ACTIVITIES RELATED TO 201 9 CHNA PRIORITIZED NEEDS . Note that numerous challenges associated with the COVID -19 pandemic had significant impact on the activities discussed in appendix 2. Social Determinants of Health This CHNA incorporates important factors associated with Social Determinants of Health (SDO H). SDOH are important environmental factors, such as where people are born, live, work and play, that affect people's well- being, physical and mental health, and quality of life. According to research conducted by the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, Healthy People 2030 has identified five SDOH that should be included in assessing community health (Figure 2 ). Figure 2 Healthy People 2030, U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, Office of Disease Prevention and Health Promotion. Retriev ed January 15, 2022, from https://health.gov/healthypeople/objectives -and-data/social -determinants -health CHNA 2022 | Delta County 8 Collaboration for sustaining health equity 2022 Assessment of SDOH is included in the CHNA, as social determinants help contribute to health inequities and disparities. Simply creating interventions without incorporating SDOH will have limited impact on improving community health for people living in underserved or at- risk are as. II. METHODS To complete the comprehensive community health needs assessment, multiple sources were examined. Secondary statistical data were used to assess the community profile, morbidity rates and causes of mortality. Additionally, a study was compl eted to examine perceptions of the community health -related issues, healthy behaviors, behavioral health, food security, social determinants of health and access to healthcare. Secondary Data Collection Existing secondary statistical data were first used to develop an overall assessment of health -related issues in the community. Within each section of the report, there are definitions, importance of categories, data and interpretations. At the end of each chapter, there is a section on key takeaways. Based on several retreats, a separate OSF Collaborative Team used COMPdata Informatics (affiliated with Illinois Health and Hospital Association (IHA) ) to identify six primary categories of diseases, including: age related, cardiovascular, respiratory, cancer, diabetes and infections. In order to define each disease category, modified definitions developed by Sg2 were used. Sg2 specializes in consulting for health -care organizations. Their team of experts includes MDs, PhDs, RNs and health -care leaders with ex tensive strategic, operational, clinical, academic, technological and financial experience. Primary Data Collection In addition to existing secondary data sources, primary survey data were also collected. This section describes the research methods used to collect, code, verify and analyze primary survey data. Specifically, the research design used for this study: survey design, data collection and data integrity. Survey Instrument Design Initially, all publicly available health -needs assessments in the U. S. were assessed to identify common themes and approaches to collecting community health -needs data. By leveraging best practices from these surveys, a new survey in 2021 was designed for use with both the general population and the at- risk community. To ensure that all critical areas were being addressed, the entire collaborative team was involved in survey design/approval through several fact- finding sessions. Additionally, several focus groups were used to collect the qualitative information necessary to design survey items. Specifically, for the community health -needs assessment, eight specific sets of items were included: Ratings of health issues in the community - to assess the importance of various community health concerns. Survey items included assessments of topics such as cancer, diabetes and obesity. Ratings of unhealthy behaviors in the community - to assess the importance of various unhealthy behaviors. Survey items included assessments of topics such as violence, drug abuse and smoking. CHNA 2022 | Delta County 9 Collaboration for sustaining health equity 2022 Ratings of issues concerning well -being - to assess the importance of various issues relating to well -being in the community. Survey items included assessments of topics such as access to healthcare, safer neighborhoods and effective public transportation. Accessibility to healthcare - to assess the degree to which residents could access healthcare when needed. Survey items included assessments of topics such as access to medical, dental and mental -healthcare, as well as access to prescription medication. Healthy behaviors - to assess the degree to which residents exhibited healthy behaviors. The survey items included assessments of topics such as exercise, healthy eating habits and cancer screenings. Behavioral health - to assess community issues related to areas such as anxiety and depression. Food security - to assess access to healthy food alternatives. Social determinants of health - to assess the impact that social determinants may have on the above -mentioned areas. Finally, demographic information was collected to assess background information necessary to segment markets in terms of the eight categories discussed above. A copy of the final survey is included in APPENDIX 3 : SURVEY . Sample Size In order to identify our potential population, we first identified the percentage of the Delta County population that was living in poverty. Specifically, we multiplied the population of the county by its respective poverty rate to identify the minimum sample size to study the at- risk population. The poverty rate for Delta County was 11.3 percent. The population used for the calculation was 3 5,666 yielding a total of 4 ,030 residents living in poverty in the Delta County area. A normal approximation to the hypergeometric distribution was assumed given the targeted sample size. n = (Nz2pq)/(E2 (N -1) + z2 pq) where: n = the required sample size N = the population size z = the value that specified the confidence interval (use 95% CI) pq = population proportions (set at .05) E =desired accuracy of sample proportions (set at +/ - .05) For the total Delta County area, the minimum sample size for aggregated analyses (combination of at -risk and general populations) was 38 1. The data collection effort for this CHNA yielded a total 5 50 usable responses. This exceeded the threshold of the desired 95% confidence interval. To provide a representative profile when assessing the aggregated population for the Delta County region, the general population was combined with a portion of the at- risk population. To represent the CHNA 2022 | Delta County 10 Collaboration for sustaining health equity 2022 at-risk population as a percentage of the aggregate population, a random -number generator was used to select at- risk c ases to include in the general sample. Additionally, efforts were made to ensure that the demography of the sample was aligned with population demographics according to U.S. Census data. This provided a total usable sample of 501 respondents for analyzing the aggregate population. Sample characteristics can be seen in APPENDIX 4 : CHARACTERISTICS OF SURVEY RESPONDENTS . Data Collection Survey data were collected in the 3rd and 4th quarter of 2021. To collect data in this study, two techniques were used. First, an online version of the survey was created. Second, a paper version of the survey was distributed. In order to be sensitive to the needs of respondents, surveys stressed assurance of complete anonymity. Note that versions of both the online survey and paper survey were translated into Spanish. To specifically target the at- risk population, surveys were distributed at homeless shelters, food pantries and soup kitchens. Since the at- risk population was specifically targeted as part of the data collection effort, this became a stratified sample, as other groups were not specifically targeted based on their socio- economic status. Note that use of electronic surveys to collect community -level data may create a potential for bias from convenience sampling error. To recognize for potential bias in the community sample, a second control sample of data was collected. Specifically, the control sample consisted of random patients surveyed at the hospital, assuming that patients receiving care represent an unbiased representation of the community. All questions on the patient version of the survey pertaining to access to healthcare were removed, as these questions were not relevant to current patients. Data from the community sample and the control sample were compared using t- tests and tetrachoric correlations when appropriate. Results show that the community sample did not exhibit any significance patterns of bias. If specific relationships exhibited a potential for bias between the community sample and the control sample, they are identified in the social -determinants sections of the analyses within each chapter. Data Integrity Comprehensive analyses were performed to verify the integrity of the data for this research. Without proper validation of the raw data, any interpretation of results could be inaccurate and misleading if used for decision -making. Therefore, several tests were performed to ensure that the data were valid. These tests were performed before any analyses were undertaken. Data were checked for coding accuracy, using descriptive frequency statistics to verify that all data items were correct. This was followed by analyses of means and standard deviations and comparison of primary data statistics to existing secondary data. Analytic Techniques To ensure statistical validity, several different analytic techniques were used. Specifically, frequencies and descriptive statistics were used for identifying patterns in residents' ratings of various health concerns. Additionally, appropriate statistical techniques were used for identification of existing relationships between perceptions, behaviors and demographic data. Specifically, Pearson correlations, CHNA 2022 | Delta County 11 Collaboration for sustaining health equity 2022 X2 tests and tetrachoric correlations were used when appropriate, given characteristics of the specific data being analyzed.

Population data provide an overview of population growth trends and build a foundation for additional analysis of data. Population Growth Data from the last census indicate the population of Delta County has slightly decreased ( <1.0%) between 201 7 and 2021 (Figure 3). CHNA 2022 | Delta County 13 Collaboration for sustaining health equity 2022 Figure 3 Source: US Census 1.2 Age, Gender and Race Distribution Importance of the measure: Population data broken down by age, gender, and race groups provide a foundation to analyze the issues and trends that impact demographic factors including economic growth and the distribution of healthcare services. Understanding the cultural diversity of communities is essential when considering health -care infrastructure and service delivery systems. Age As illustrated in Figure 4 , the percentage of individuals in Delta County in four age group s has de clined over the five- year period 2015 and 201 9. Most notably, those in the 35 -49 and 50- 64 age group s declined at least 6.5%. The only age group that increased was residents aged 65 + years , increasing 1 3.5% over the same five- year period . 35,89035,84335,78435,72535,666Population Growth Delta County 2017 -2021 2021 2020 2019 2018 2017 CHNA 2022 | Delta County 14 Collaboration for sustaining health equity 2022 Figure 4 Source: US Census Gender The gender distribution of Delta County residents has remained relatively consistent between 201 7 and 201 9 (Figure 5 ). Figure 5 Source: US Census Race With regard to race and ethnic background, Delta County is largely homogenous, yet in recent years, the county is becoming more diverse. Data from 201 9 suggest that White ethnicity comprises 9 2.9% of the - 2,000 4,000 6,000 8,000 10,000 0-19 years 20-34 years 35-49 years 50-64 years 65+ yearsAge Distribution Delta 2015 -2019 2015 2016 2017 2018 2019 CHNA 2022 | Delta County 15 Collaboration for sustaining health equity 2022 population in Delta County. However, the non- White population of Delta County has been increasing (from 6.8% to 7.1% in 201 9), with Black ethnicity comprising 0.3% of the population, multi- racial ethnicity comprising 3.6% of the population and Hispanic/Latino (LatinX) ethnicity comprising 0.8% of the population ( Figure 6). Figure 6 Source: US Census 1.3 Household/Family Importance of the measure: Families are an important component of a robust society in Delta County, as they dramatically impact the health and development of children and provide support and well -being for older adults. As indicated in Figure 7 , the number of family households in Delta County increased slightly from 201 7 to 2019. 1.9%2.0% 3.4%3.6% 0.4%0.4% 0.8%0.8% 0.3%0.3% 93.2%92.9%Racial Distribution Delta County 2010 -2019 White Black and African American Hispanic/Latino Asian Two or More Races American Indian/Alaska Native CHNA 2022 | Delta County 16 Collaboration for sustaining health equity 2022 Figure 7 Source: US Census Family Composition In Delta County, data from 201 9 suggest the percentage of two -parent families in Delta County is 50.5%. One -person households represent 35.3% of the county population, single- female households represent 9.6%, and single- male households represent 4.7% ( Figure 8 Figure 8 Source: US Census 50.5% 9.6%4.7%35.3%Household Types Delta County 2019 Two-parent Families Single Female Single Male One Person CHNA 2022 | Delta County 17 Collaboration for sustaining health equity 2022 Early Sexual Activity Leading to Births from Teenage Mothers Delta County has experienced a slight fluctuation in teenage birth count . The teen birth count steadily decreased from 2015 -2019 ( Figure 9 ). Figure 9 Source: Michigan Department o f Public Health 1.4 Economic Information Importance of the measure: Median income divides households into two segments with one- half of households earning more than the median income and the other half earning less. Because median income is not significantly impacted by unusually high or low -income values, it is considered a more reliable indicator than average income. To live in poverty means to lack sufficient income to meet one's basic needs. Accordingly, poverty is associated with numerous chronic social, health, education and employment conditions. Economic Climat e Economic climate is a measure of a community's financial resources and resiliency. Key risk influencers include income, cost of living and opportunity. For Delta County, 17% of the population is at elevated risk for economic climate. This is low er than the State of Michigan average of 26% (SocialScape \u00ae powered by SociallyDetermined\u00ae, 2022). Median Income Level For 2019, the median household income in Delta County ($ 47,434 ) was lower than the State of Michigan ($65,886) (Figure 10 ). 25 26 1917 17Teen Births Delta County 2015 -2019 2015 2016 2017 2018 2019 CHNA 2022 | Delta County 18 Collaboration for sustaining health equity 2022 Figure 10 Source: US Census Unemployment For the years 201 6 to 2020, the Delta County unemployment rate was at or higher than the State of Michigan unemployment rate, except in 2018 . Overall, between 201 6 and 2019 , unemployment in Delta County decreased by approximately 1.5%, with a sharp increase in 2020 likely due to the COVID -19 pandemic ( Figure 11) . Figure 11 Source: Bureau of Labor Statistics 47,434 65,886 Median Household Income (USD) Delta County 2019 Delta County State of Michigan Delta County State of Michigan6.6% 5.7%6.2%5.7% 5.3% 5.7%5.1%5.1%8.7%8.0%Unemployment Rates Delta County 2016 -2020 2016 2017 2018 2019 2020 CHNA 2022 | Delta County 19 Collaboration for sustaining health equity 2022 Individuals in Poverty In Delta County, the percentage of individuals living in poverty between 2017 and 2019 decreased by 3.1% . The poverty rate for individuals is 1 1.3%, which is slightly lower than the State of Michigan individual poverty rate of 1 2.6%. Poverty has a significant impact on the development of children and youth ( Figure 12). Figure 12 Source: US Census 1.5 Education Importance of the measure: According to the National Center for Educational Statistics1, \"The better educated a person is, the more likely that person is to report being in 'excellent' or 'very good' health, regardless of income.\" Research suggests that the higher the level of educational attainment and the more successful one is in school, the better one's health will be and the greater likelihood of one selecting healthy lifestyle choices. Accordingly, years of education is strongly related to an individual's propensity to earn a higher salary, gain better employment, and foster multifaceted success in life. High School Graduation Rates In 2020 , the graduation rate remained close to State of Michigan averages of 82.1%. ( Figure 13). 1 NCES 2005 Delta County 2017 Delta County 2019 State of Michigan 201914.4% 11.3%12.6%Poverty Rate Delta County 2017 -2019 CHNA 2022 | Delta County 20 Collaboration for sustaining health equity 2022 Figure 13 Source: Michigan Department of Education 1.6 Internet Accessibility Survey respondents were asked if they had Internet access. Of respondents, 92% indicated they had Internet in their homes. For those who did not have Internet in their home, cost was the most frequently cited reason ( Figure 14) . Note that these data are displayed in frequencies rather than percentages given the low number o f responses.

Key risk influencers include affordability, accessibility and digital literacy. For Delta County, 43% of the population is at elevated risk for digital landscape. State of Michigan average for digital landscape was not available (SocialScape \u00ae powered by SociallyDetermined\u00ae, 2022). Social Determinants Related to Internet Access Several factors show significant relationships with an individual's Internet access. The following relationships were found using correlational analyses: Access to Internet tends to be higher for women, younger people, those with higher education and those with higher income. Access to Internet tends to be rated lower by people living in an unstable (e.g., homeless) housing environment.

Therefore, accessibility to healthcare must address both the as sociated financial costs and the supply and demand of medical services. Choice of Medical Care Survey respondents were asked to select the type of health -care facility used when sick. Six different alternatives were presented, including clinic or doctor's office, emergency department, urgent- care facility, health department, no medical treatment and other. The most common response for source of medical care was clinic/doctor's office, chosen by 7 9% of survey respondents. This was followed by not seeking m edical attention (1 1%), urgent care (8%), the emergency department at a hospital ( 1%) and the health department (0%). ( Figure 15) . CHNA 2022 | Delta County 24 Collaboration for sustaining health equity 2022 Figure 15 Source: CHNA Survey Comparison to 2019 CHNA While most of the choices for medical care remained steady, Clinic/doctor's office increased from 75% in 2019 to 79% in 20 22. Note that the percentage of the population that does not seek medical care (11%) is relatively higher than other OSF communities. Social Determinants Related to Choice of Medical Care Several factors show significant relationships with an individual's choice of medical care. The following relationships were found using correlational analyses: Clinic/Doctor's Office tends to be used more often by women, older people, and those with higher education. Clinic/Doctor's office tends to be used less by people living in an unstable (e.g., homeless) housing environment. Urgent Care did not have any significant correlates . Emergency Department tends to be used more by men, Native Americans, those with lower education and lower income. Do Not Seek Medical Care tends to be chosen more by men, younger people and by people living in an unstable (e.g ., homeless) housing environment. Health Department did not have any significant correlates.

The following relationships were found using correlational analyses: Medicare tends to be used more frequently by men, older people, White people and those with lower income. Medicaid tends to be used more frequently by younger people, those with lower income, and those with lower education. Private Insurance is used more often by younger people, White people, those with higher education and those with higher income. Commercial/Employer insurance is used less often by people living in an unstable (e.g., homeless) housing environment. No Insurance tends to be r eported more often by younger people , Native Americans, those with lower education and people living in an unstable (e.g., homeless) housing environment. Access to Care In the CHNA survey, respondents were asked, \"Was there a time when you needed care but were not able to get it?\" Access to four types of care were assessed: medical care, prescription medication, dental care and counseling. Survey results show that 1 0% of the population did not have access to medical care when needed; 1 1% of the populatio n did not have access to prescription medication when needed; 1 7% of the population did not have access to dental care when needed; and 1 9% of the population did not have access to counseling when needed (Figure 18). 9 2 1Reasons for No Insurance Delta County 2022 I Cannot Afford I Don't Need I Don't Know How CHNA 2022 | Delta County 27 Collaboration for sustaining health equity 2022 Figure 18 Source: CHNA Survey Social Determinants Related to Access to Care Several characteristics show a significant relationship with an individual's ability to access care when needed. The following relationships were found using correlational analyses: Access to medical care tends to be higher for older people and those with higher income. Access to prescription medication tends to be higher for those with higher income. Access to prescription medication tends to be lower for people living in an unstable (e.g., homeless) housing environment. Access to dental care tends to be higher for older people, those with higher education and those with higher income. Access to counseling tends to be rated higher by older people. Reasons for No Access - Medical Care Survey respondents who reported they were not able to get medical care when needed were asked a follow -up question. Based on frequencies, the leading cause of the inability to gain access to medical care were too long to wait for an appointment ( 25) (Figure 19).

Transportation Network Transportation network is a measure of the adequacy of the transportation network to facilitate access to care . Key risk influencers inc lude access and proximity to resources. While survey data indicate transportation was not a leading cause of inaccessibility for Delta County, 4 3% of the population is at elevated risk for transportation network . This is higher than the State of Michigan average of 14% (SocialScape \u00ae powered by SociallyDetermined\u00ae, 2022). 50 34 15 15 151412 12 5Causes of Inability to Access Counseling Delta County 2022 Could Not Find Wait Too Long Could Not Afford Co-Pay Counselor Refused Insurance No Trust Embarrassment No Insurance Transportation Discrimination CHNA 2022 | Delta County 31 Collaboration for sustaining health equity 2022 2.2 Wellness Importance of the measure: Preventative health -care measures, including getting a flu shot, engaging in a healthy lifestyle and undertaking screenings for diseases are essential to combating morbidity and mortality while reducing health -care costs. Frequency of Flu Shots The overall health of a community is impacted by preventative measures including immunizations and vaccinations. Figure 23 shows that the percentage of peop le who have had a flu shot is 61.6% for Delta County in 2019. The State of Michigan had a lower vaccination percentage of 3 8.2% (Figure 23 ). Note that data have not been updated by the Michigan Department of Public Health. Figure 23 Source: CHNA Survey COVID -19 Vaccinations Figure 24 shows the percentage of people who have been fully vaccinated from the COVID -19 viru s. Delta County is above half at 64.3% and above the State of Michigan at 6 2.8%. Additionally, given the recency of the COVID -19 virus, no historical comparisons are made at this time.

Having a personal physician suggests that individuals are more likely to get wellness check -ups and less likely to use an emergency department as a primary healthcare service. According to survey data, 9 5% of residents have a personal physician ( Figure 25). Figure 25 Source: CHNA Survey Delta County State of Michigan64.3%62.8%Percent of Population Fully Vaccinated COVID -19 5% 95%Use of Personal Physician Delta County 2022 No Yes CHNA 2022 | Delta County 33 Collaboration for sustaining health equity 2022 Comparison to 2019 CHNA Having a personal physician has increased. Specifically, 9 1% of residents reported having a personal physician in 2019 and 9 5% report the same in 2022. Social Determinants Related to Having a Personal Physician The following characteristics show significant relationships with having a personal physician. The following relationships were found using correlational analyses: Having a personal physician tends to be more likely for older people. Native Americans tend to be less likely to have a personal physician. Cancer Screening Early detection of cancer may greatly improve the probability of successful treatment. In the case of colorectal cancer, early detection of precancerous polyps can prevent cancer. Specifically, four types of cancer screening were measured: breast, cervical , prostate and colorectal. Results from the CHNA survey show that 74% of women had a breast screening in the past five years and 70% of women had a cervical screening . For men, 39% had a prostate screening in the past five years. For women and men over the age of 50, 47% had a colorectal screening in the last five years (Figure 26) . Figure 26 Source: CHNA Survey 74% 70% 39%47%Cancer Screening in Past 5 years Delta County 2022 Breast (for women) Cervical (for women) Prostate (for men) Colorectal (over age 50) CHNA 2022 | Delta County 34 Collaboration for sustaining health equity 2022 Comparison to 2019 CHNA Results for breast screening showed a slight increase, while colorectal screening and prostate screening both showed a marked decrease. Note that this is the first year the CHNA survey assessed cervical screening, so there is no comparison to 2019. Social Determinants Related to Cancer Screenings Multiple characteristics show significant relationships with cancer screening. The following relationships were found using correlational analyses: Breast screening tends to be more likely for older women and those with hig her income. Breast screening tends to be less likely for women who live in an unstable (e.g., homeless) housing environment. Cervical screening tends to be more likely for women, those with a higher education and those with higher income. Cervical screening tends to be less likely for women who live in an unstable (e.g., homeless) housing environment. Prostate screening tends to be more likely for older men and those with a higher education. Colorectal screening tends to be more likely for older people and those with higher income. Physical Exercise A healthy lifestyle, comprised of regular physical activity, has been shown to increase physical, mental, and emotional well -being. Specifically, 2 8% of respondents indicated that they do not exercise at all, while the majority (5 8%) of residents exercise 1 -5 times per week (Figure 27 ). CHNA 2022 | Delta County 35 Collaboration for sustaining health equity 2022 Figure 27 Source: CHNA Survey To find out why some residents do not exercise at all, a follow up question was asked. Similar to the 2019 CHNA, the most common reasons for not exercising are not having enough energy ( 29%), not enough time ( 20%) and a dislike of exercise ( 18%) . Figure 28 Source: CHNA Survey 28%30%28% 14%Days of Exercise in Last Week Delta County 2022 I Don't 1 to 2 days per week 3 to 5 days per week More than 5 per week 29% 20% 18% 11% 10% 7% 5%Reasons Did Not Exercise in Last Week Delta County 2022 Too tired No time Don't like Safety Cannot afford Access Child care CHNA 2022 | Delta County 36 Collaboration for sustaining health equity 2022 Comparison to 2019 CHNA There has been decline in exercise. Specifically, there is an increase in those who do not exercise. In 2019, 23% of residents indicated they did not exercise at all and 29% indicated they did not exercise in 2022. Social Determinants Related to Exercise One characteristic show s a significant relationship with frequ ency of exercise. The following relationship was found using correlational analyses: Frequency of exercise tends to be more likely for men . Healthy Eating A healthy lifestyle, comprised of a proper diet, has been shown to increase physical, mental and emotional well -being. Consequently, nutrition and diet are critical to preventative care. Almost two- thirds (6 4%) of residents report no consumption or low c onsumption (1 -2 servings per day) of fruits and vegetables per day. Note that the percentage of residents who consume five or more servings per day is only 4 % (Figure 29 ). Figure 29 Source: CHNA Survey Those individuals who indicated they do not eat any fruits or vegetables were asked a follow up question. Reasons most frequently given for failing to eat more fruits and vegetables are not l iking fruits and vegetables ( 8) and a lack of importance ( 8) (Figure 30) . Note that these data are displayed in frequencies rather than percentages given the low number of responses.

Social Determinants Related to Healthy Eating Multiple characteristics show significant relationships with healthy eating. The following relationships were found using correlational analyses: Consumption of fruits and v egetables tends to be more likely for older people and those with a higher level of education and those with higher income. Restricted Diet Respondents were also asked if they followed a restricted diet if recently diagnosed with a morbidity. Of respondents, 35% usually or always follow a restricted diet ( Figure 31) . 8 8 6 1 1 1 0Reasons Don't Eat Fruits and Vegetables Delta County 2022 I don't like Not important Cannot afford Cannot prepare Transportation No refrigerator/stove Don't know where to buy CHNA 2022 | Delta County 38 Collaboration for sustaining health equity 2022 Figure 31 Source: CHNA Survey Comparison to 2019 CHNA There has been an increase in those who follow a restricted diet if recently diagnosed with a morbidity. In 2019, 40% of respondents indicated they usually or always followed a restricted diet compared to 46% in 2022. Social Determinants Related to F ollowing a R estricted Diet Multiple characteristics show significant relationships with following a restricted diet. The following relationships were found using correlational analyses: Following a restricted diet tends to be more likely for older people, those with a higher education and those with higher income. Health Literacy Health literacy is a measure of factors in the community that impact healthcare access, navigation and adherence. Key risk influencers include culture, demographics and education. For Delta County, 8 % of the population is at elevated risk for health literacy . This is lower than the State of Michigan average of 23% Do You Follow Your Restricted Diet Delta County 2022 Never Sometimes Usually Always CHNA 2022 | Delta County 39 Collaboration for sustaining health equity 2022 2.3 Understanding Food Insecurity Importance of the measure: It is essential that everyone has access to food and drink necessary for living healthy lives. Food insecurity exists when people don't have physical and economic access to sufficient, safe and nutritious food that meets their dietary needs for a healthy life. Prevalence of Hunger Respondents were asked, \"How many days a week do you or your family members go hungry?\" The vast majority of respondents indicated they do not go hungry, however, 2 % indicated they go hungry 1 or more days per week (Figure 32 ). Figure 32 Source: CHNA Survey Social Determinants Related to Prevalence of Hunger Multiple characteristics show significant relationships with hunger. The following relationships were found using correlational analyses: Prevalence of Hunger tends to be more likely for those with less education and less income. Primary Source of Food Respondents were asked to identify their primary source of food. It can be seen that the majority (9 5%) identified a grocery store ( Figure 33). 98% 1% 1%Times per Week Go Hungry Delta County 2022 None 1 to 2 days per week 3 to 5 days per week CHNA 2022 | Delta County 40 Collaboration for sustaining health equity 2022 Figure 33 Source: CHNA Survey Food Landscape Food landsc ape is a measure of the conditions that affect the ability of residents to access health y, affordable nutrition. Key risk influencers include accessibility, affordability and literacy. For Delta County, 37% of the population is at elevated risk for food landscape . This is higher than the State of Michigan average of 27% (SocialScape \u00ae powered by SociallyDetermined \u00ae, 2022). 2.4 Physical Environment Importance of the measure: According to the County Health Rankings, Air Pollution - Particulate Matter (APPM) is the average daily density of fine particulate matter in micrograms per cubic meter (PM2.5) in a county. Fine particulate matter is defined as particles of air pollutants with an aerodynamic diameter less than 2.5 micrometers. These particles can be directly emitted from sources such as forest fires, or they can form when gases are emitted from power plants, manufacturing facilities and automobiles. The relationship between elevated air pollution, particularly fine particulate matter and ozone, and compromised health has been well documented. Negative consequences of ambient air pollution include decreased lung f unction, chronic bronchitis, asthma and other adverse pulmonary effects. The APPM for Delta County (7.1) is lower than the State average of 8.4 ( Figure 34). 95% 2% 1%1% 1% 0%0%Primary Source of Food Delta County 2022 Grocery Store Fast food Food pantry Farm/garden Convenience store Food delivery Gas station CHNA 2022 | Delta County 41 Collaboration for sustaining health equity 2022 Figure 34 Source: C ounty Health Rankings 2021 2.5 Health Status Importance of the measure: Self-perceptions of health can provide important insights to help manage population health. Not only do self -perceptions provide benchmarks regarding health status, but they can also provide insights into how accurately people perceive their own health. Mental Health The survey asked respondents to indicate specific issues, such as depression and stress/anxiety. Of respondents, 51% indicated they did not feel depressed in the last 30 days (Figure 35) and 5 7% indicated they did not feel anxious or stressed (Figure 36 ). 7.18.4Air Pollution -Particulate Matter Delta County 2020 Delta County State of Michigan CHNA 2022 | Delta County 42 Collaboration for sustaining health equity 2022 Figure 35 Source: CHNA Survey Figure 36 Source: CHNA Survey Comparison to 2019 CHNA Results for both depression and stress/anxiety were similar to the 2019 CHNA. 51% 28% 12%9%Felt Depressed Last 30 Days Delta County 2022 I Don't 1 to 2 days 3 to 5 days More than 5 days 57% 24% 10% 9%Felt Anxious or Stressed Last 30 Days Delta County 2022 I Don't 1 to 2 3 to 5 More than 5 CHNA 2022 | Delta County 43 Collaboration for sustaining health equity 2022 Respondents were also asked if they spoke with anyone about their mental health in the past year.

In this way, health -care organizations can target affected populations more effectively. Research suggests tobacco use facilitates a wide variety of adverse medical conditions. CHNA survey data show 88 % of respondents do not smoke and only 3% state they smoke more than 12 times per day (Figure 41) . Only 6 % of respondents vape on a daily basis (Figure 42) . CHNA Survey of Smoking Delta County 2022 None 1 to 4 times per day 5 to 8 times per day 9 to 12 times per day More than 12 times per day CHNA 2022 | Delta County 48 Collaboration for sustaining health equity 2022 Figure 42 Source: CHNA Survey Comparison to 2019 CHNA Results are the same as the 2019 CHNA. Social Determinants Related to Smoking or Vaping Multiple characteristics show significant relationships with smoking or vaping. The following relationships were found using correlational analyses: Smoking tends to be rated higher by men, those with less education and a lower income. Vaping tends to be rated higher by Native American people, those with less education, a lower income, an d people living in an unstable (e.g., homeless) housing environment. Vaping tends to be rated lower by White people. 3.2 Drug and Alcohol Abuse Importance of the measure: Alcohol and drugs impair decision -making, often leading to adverse consequences and outcomes. Research suggests that alcohol is a gateway drug for youth, leading to increased usage of controlled substances in adult years. Accordingly, the substance abuse values and behaviors of high school students is a leading indicator of adult substance abuse in later years. Excessive Drinking Data from the 2019 County Health Rankings measures excessive drinking in Delta County as the percentage of the county's adult population that reports binge or heavy drinking in the past 30 days. 94% 2% 1% 1% 2%Frequency of Vaping Delta County 2022 None 1 to 4 times per day 5 to 8 times per day 9 to 12 times per day More than 12 times per day CHNA 2022 | Delta County 49 Collaboration for sustaining health equity 2022 Binge drinking is defined as a woman consuming more than four alcoholic drinks during a single occasion or a man consuming more than five alcoholic drinks during a single occasion. Heavy drinking is defined as a woman drinking more than one drink on average per day or a man drinking more than two drinks on average per day. Excessive drinking is calculated as the sum of both behaviors. However, for years 2015 - 2019, Delta County reported equal rates of excessive drinking (19%) while the State of Michigan increased to 21% (Figure 43) . Figure 43 Source: County Health Rankings Adult Substance Use The CHNA survey asked respondents to indicate usage of several substances. Of respondents, 7 6% indicated they did not consume alcohol on a typical day (Figure 44) , 90% indicated they do not take prescription medication improperly including opioids on a typical day (Figure 45) , 93% indicated they do not use marijuana on a typical day (Figure 46) and 100% indicated they do not use illegal substances on a typical day (Figure 47). Note this is the first year that the CHNA has measured separated categories of substance use, so there is no comparison to the 2019 CHNA. 2015 -2019 Delta County State of Michigan 2019 CHNA 2022 | Delta County 50 Collaboration for sustaining health equity 2022 Figure 44 Source: CHNA Survey Figure 45 Source: 76% 19% 4%1%Daily Alcohol Consumption Delta County 2022 I Don't 1 to 2 3 to 5 More than 5 90% 7%2%1%Daily Improper Use of Prescription Medication Delta County 2022 I Don't 1 to 2 times 3 to 5 times More than 5 times CHNA 2022 | Delta County 51 Collaboration for sustaining health equity 2022 Figure 46 Source: CHNA Survey Figure 47 Source: CHNA Survey Social Determinants Related to Substance Use Multiple characteristics show significant relationships with substance abuse.

Research strongly suggests that obesity is a significant problem facing youth and adults nationally, in Michi gan, and within D elta County. The US Surgeon General has characterized obesity as \"the fastest- growing, most threatening disease in America today.\" According to the Obesity Prevention Initiative from the Michigan General Assembly, 20% of Michigan children are obese. The financial burden of overweight and obese individuals is staggering, as the estimated annual medical costs attributed to obesity in Michigan for 1998- 2000 exceeded $3.4 billion, ranking Michigan 6 th in the nation for obesity -attributed medic al costs. With children, research has linked obesity to numerous chronic diseases including Type II diabetes, hypertension, high blood pressure and asthma. Adverse physical health side effects of obesity include orthopedic problems due to weakened join ts and lower bone density. Detrimental mental health side effects include low self -esteem, poor body image, symptoms of depression and suicide ideation. Obesity impacts educational performance as well; studies suggest school absenteeism of obese children is six times higher than that of non- obese children. With adults, obesity has far -reaching consequences. Testimony to the Michigan General Assembly indicated that obesity -related illnesses contribute to worker absenteeism, slow workflow and high worker c ompensation rates. A Duke University study on the effects of obesity in the workforce noted 13 times more missed workdays by obese employees than non- obese employees. Nationwide, lack of physical activity and poor nutrition contribute to an estimated 30 0,000 preventable deaths per year. In Delta County, the number of people diagnosed with obesity and being overweight has increased f rom 201 7-2018 to 201 9-2020. Note specifically that the percentage of obese and overweight people has increased from 77. 6% in 2017 to 82.2% in 20 20. Overweight and obesity rates in Michigan have increased slightly from 201 7 (68.4) to 20 20 ( 69.2%) (Figure 48 ). Additionally , in the 20 22 CHNA survey, respondents indicated that being overweight was their most prevalently diagnosed health condition.

Note that hospital -level data only show hospital admissions and do not reflect outpatient treatments and procedures. 4.1 Self -Identified Health Conditions Survey respond ents were asked to self -identify any health conditions. Note that being overweight ( 30%) was significantly higher than any other health conditions. This percentage is significantly lower than secondary sources. Specifically, Behavioral Risk Factor Surveill ance System (BRFSS) data indicate that over 80% of the population is overweight or obese. (Figure 51) . CHNA 2022 | Delta County 56 Collaboration for sustaining health equity 2022 Figure 51 Source: CHNA Survey 4.2 Healthy Babies Importance of the measure: Regular prenatal care is a vital aspect in producing healthy babies and children. Screening and treatment for medical conditions as well as identification and interventions for behavioral risk factors associated with poor birth outcomes are important asp ects of healthy babies. Research suggests that women who receive adequate prenatal care are more likely to have better birth outcomes, such as full term and normal weight babies. Low Birth Weight Rates Low birth weight rate is defined as the percentage of infants born below 2,500 grams or 5.5 pounds. Very low birth weight rate is defined as the percentage of infants born below 1,500 grams or 3.3 pounds. In contrast, the average newborn weighs about 7 pounds. The percentage of babies born with low birth weight in Delta County has remained constant at 7% Overweight Allergy Mental health Asthma/COPD Diabetes Heart Memory Cancer Stroke CHNA 2022 | Delta County 57 Collaboration for sustaining health equity 2022 Figure 52 Source: County Health Ranking s 4.3 Cardiovascular Disease Importance of the measure: Cardiovascular disease is defined as all diseases of the heart and blood vessels, including ischemic (also known as coronary) heart disease, cerebrovascular disease, congestive heart failure, hypertensive disease and atheroscler osis. Coronary Atherosclerosis Coronary Atherosclerosis, sometimes -called hardening of the arteries, can slowly narrow and harden the arteries throughout the body. When atherosclerosis affects the arteries of the heart, it is called coronary artery diseas e. Coronary artery disease is a leading cause of death for Americans. Most of these deaths are from heart attacks caused by sudden blood clots in the heart's arteries. The number of cases of coronary atherosclerosis complication at Delta County area hospitals has been low, with 1 case reported each year from 2018- 2020 ( Figure 53 ).

These conditions are characterized by breathlessness, wheezing, ch ronic coughing, frequent respiratory infections and chest tightness. Many respiratory conditions can be successfully controlled with medical supervision and treatment. However, children and adults who do not have access to adequate medical care are likel y to experience repeated serious episodes, trips to the emergency room and absences from school and work. Hospitalization rates illustrate the worst episodes of respiratory diseases and are a proxy measure for inadequate treatment. Asthma The percentage o f residents who have asthma in Delta County has de creased between 20 17-2020. State of Michigan rates have de creased as well. According to the Michigan BRFSS, asthma rates in Delta County (16. 3%) are higher than the State of Michigan (15 .9%) (Figure 58) .

Figure 60 Source: National Cancer Institute 4.6 Diabetes Importance of the measure: Diabetes is the leading cause of kidney failure, adult blindness and amputations and is a leading contributor to strokes and heart attacks. It is estimated that 90 -95% of individuals with diabetes have Type II diabetes (previously known as adult- onset diabetes). Only 5 -10% of individuals with diabetes have Type I diabetes (previously known as juvenile diabetes). Inpatient cases of Type II diabetes from Delta County increased between 2018 (7 cases) and 2019 (9 cases), followed by another increase in 2020 (14 cases) (Figure 61 ).

It would be highly cost -effective for both individuals and society if more programs focused on prevention rather than treatment of infectious diseases. Chlamydia and Gonorrhea Cases The data for the number of infections of chlamydia in Delta County from 201 7 indicate an increase; however, t here is a slight decrease of incidence of chlamydia across the State of Michigan . Rates of chlamydia in Delta County are lower than State averages (Figure 64 ).

These injuries are often indicative of serious mental health problems requiring the treatment of other trauma- inducing issues. Unintentional injuries can occur, in part, from violent crimes. CHNA 2022 | Delta County 68 Collaboration for sustaining health equity 2022 Suicide The number of suicides in Delta County indicate higher incidence than State of Michigan averages, as there were approximately 21.9 per 100,000 people in Delta County in 201 8, note this is significantly higher than state averages of 11 (Figure 66). Figur e 66 Source: Michigan Department of Public Health and Human Services Violent Crimes Violent crimes are defined as offenses that involve face- to-face confrontation between the victim and the perpetrator, including homicide, forcible rape, robbery and aggravated assault. Violent crime is represented as an annual rate per 100,000 people. The number of violent crimes has decreased significantly for 2019 -2020 in Delta County (Figure 67 ).

CHNA 2022 | Delta County 71 Collaboration for sustaining health equity 2022 CHAPTER 5 OUTLINE 5.1 Perceptions of Health Issues 5.2 Perceptions of Unhealthy Behavior 5.3 Perceptions of Issues with Well Being 5.4 Summary of Community Health Issues 5.5 Community Resources 5.6 Significant Needs Identified and Prioritized CHAPTER 5 : PRIORITIZATION OF HEALTH -RELATED ISSUES In this chapter, the most critical health -related needs in the community are identified. To accomplish this, community perceptions of health issues, unhealthy behaviors and issues related to well -being were first considered. Key takeaways from each chapter were then used to identify important health -related issues in the community. Next, a comprehensive inventory of community resources w as completed; and finally, the most significant health needs in the community are prioritized. Specific criteria used to identify these issues included: (1) magnitude in the community; (2) severity in the community; (3) potential for impact to the community. 5.1 Perceptions of Health Issues The CHNA survey asked respondents to rate the three most important health issues in the community. Respondents had a choice of 11 different options. The health issue that rated highest was mental health ( 23%), followed by obesity/overweight and cancer ( 13%). Note that perceptions of the community were accurate in some cases. For example, mental health is a leading health concern in the community . Also, cancer and obesity are important concerns and the survey respondents accurately identified these as important health issues. However, some perceptions were inaccurate. For example, while heart disease is a leading cause of mortality, it is ranked relatively low. CHNA 2022 | Delta County 72 Collaboration for sustaining health equity 2022 Figure 68 Source: CHNA Survey 5.2 Perceptions of Unhealthy Behaviors Respondents were asked to select the three most important unhealthy behaviors in the community out of a total of 10 choices. The two unhealthy behaviors that rated highest were drug abuse (illegal) at 28% and alcohol abuse at 22% ( Figure 69). These t wo factors were significantly higher than other categories based on t-tests between sample means.

The issue impacting well -being that rated highest w ere healthy food choices (18%) and access to health (18%) ( Figure 70 ). These two factors were significantly higher than other categories based on t -tests between sample means. Figure 70 Source: CHNA Survey 5.4 Summary of Community Health Issues Based on findings from the previous analyses, a chapter -by-chapter summary of key takeaways is used to provide a foundation for identification of the most important health -related issues in the community. Considerations for identifying key takeaways include magnitude in the community, strategic importance to the community, existing community resources and potential for impact and trends and future forecasts. Demographics (Chapter 1) - Three factors were identified as the most important areas of impact from the demographic analyses: Population decreased Population over age 65 increased Single female head -of-house -household represents 10% of the population Prevention Behaviors (C hapter 2) - Seven factors were identified as the most important areas of impact from the chapter on prevention behaviors: 2%4%5%6%6%9%10%11%11%18%18%Perceptions of Issues that Impact Well Being Delta County 2022 Healthy Food Choices Access to Healthcare Job Opportunities Less Hatred Less Poverty Affordable Clean Housing Safer Neighborhoods Available Child Care Less Violence Public Transportation Better School Attendance CHNA 2022 | Delta County 74 Collaboration for sustaining health equity 2022 Not seeking medical care when needed Access to counseling services COVID -19 vaccination rate Prostate screening and colorectal screen ing are relatively low Exercise and healthy eating behaviors Depression and stress/anxiety Food insecurity Symptoms and Predictors (Chapter 3) - Two factors were identified as the most important areas of impact from the chapter on symptoms and predictors: Overweight and obesity Misuse of prescription medication Morbidity and Mortality (Chapter 4) - Three factors were identified as the most impor tant areas of impact from the chapter on morbidity/mortality behaviors: Cancer , heart disease and COVID -19 are leading causes of mortality Prostate cancer Suicide rates Potential Health -Related Needs Considered for Prioritization Before the prioritiz ation of significant community health -related needs was performed, results were aggregated into 9 potential categories. Based on similarities and duplication, the 9 potential areas considered are: Not seeking healthcare when needed Aging issues Healthy behaviors - nutrition & exercise Behavioral health Overweight/Obesity Access - mental -health counseling Cancer screening Food insecurity Suicide CHNA 2022 | Delta County 75 Collaboration for sustaining health equity 2022 5.5 Community Resources After summarizing potential categories for prioritization in the Community Health Needs Assessment, a comprehensive analysis of existing community resources was performed to identify the efficacy to which these 9 health -related areas were being addressed. A resource matrix can be seen in APPENDIX 5 : RESOURCE MATRIX relating to the 9 health -related issues. There are numerous forms of resources in the community. They are categorized as recreational facilities, county health departments, community agencies and area hospitals/clinics. A detailed list of community resources and descriptions appears in APPENDIX 6 : DESCRIPTION OF COMMUNITY RESOURCES . 5.6 Significant Needs Identified and Prioritized In order to prioritize the previously identified dimensions, the collaborative team considered health needs based on: (1) magnitude of the issues (e.g., what percentage of the population was impacted by the issue); (2) severity of the issues in terms of their relationship with morbidities and mortalities; (3) potential impact through collaboration. Using a modified version of the Hanlon Method (as seen in APPENDIX 7: P RIORITIZATION METHODOLOGY ), the collaborative team identified two significant health needs and considered them equal priorities: Healthy Behaviors - defined as exercise, obesity, and food insecurity Behavior Health - including mental health, substance abuse and access to counseling HEALTHY BEHAVIORS - EXERCISE , OBESITY AND FOOD INSECURITY EXERCISE . A healthy lifestyle, comprised of regular physical activity has been shown to increase physical, mental and emotional well -being. Note that 28% of respondents indicated that they do not exercise at all, while the majority (58 %) of residents exercise 1 -5 times per week. The most common reasons for not exercising are not having enough energy (29%) or time (20%) and a dislike of exercise (18%). Frequency of exercise tends to be more likely for men. There has been a decrease in those who exercise compared to data from the 2019 CHNA. In 2019, 64% of residents indicated they exercise 1 -5 times per week and 58% indicated they exercise in 2022. OBESITY . In Delta County, 8 2.2% of residents were diagnosed with obesity and being overweight. This is an increase of nearly 5% from the previous 2 -year assessment. Moreover, Delta County is significantly higher than the State of Michigan average of 69.2%. In the 2022 CHNA survey, respondents indicated that being overweight was the second most important health issue and was rated as the most prevalently diagnosed health condition. Research strongly suggests that obesity is a significant problem facing youth and adults nationally, in Michigan and within Delta County. The U.S. Surgeon General has characterized obesity as \"the fastest- growing, most threatening disease in America today.\" With children, research has linked obesity to numerous chronic diseases including Type II diabetes, hypertension, high blood pressure, and asthma. Adverse physical health side effects of obesity include orthopedic problems due to weakened joints and lower bone density. Detrimental mental health side effects include low self -esteem, poor body image, symptoms of depression, and suicide ideation. Obesity impacts educational CHNA 2022 | Delta County 76 Collaboration for sustaining health equity 2022 performance as well; studies suggest school absenteeism of obese children is six times higher than that of non-obese children. With adults, obesity has far -reaching consequences. Testimony to the Michigan General Assembly indicated that obesity -related illnesses contribute to worker absenteeism, slow workflow and high worker compensation rates. A Duke University study on the effects of obesity in the workforce noted 13 times more m issed workdays by obese employees than non- obese employees. FOOD INSECURITY. It is essential that everyone has access to food and drink necessary for living healthy lives. Food insecurity exists when people don't have physical and economic access to suf ficient, safe and nutritious food that meets their dietary needs for a healthy life. Respondents from the CHNA survey indicated that 2% of the population goes hungry at least one a week. Prevalence of hunger tends to be more likely for those with less edu cation and less income. Another indicator of food insecurity is food landscape. Food landscape is a measure of the conditions that affect the ability of residents to access healthy, affordable nutrition. Key risk influencers include accessibility, affor dability and literacy. For Delta County, 37% of the population is at elevated risk for food landscape. This is higher than the State of Michigan average of 27% (SocialScape\u00ae powered by SociallyDetermined\u00ae, 2022). BEHAVIORAL HEALTH - MENTAL HEALTH , SUBSTAN CE ABUSE AND ACCESS TO COUNSELING MENTAL HEALTH. The CHNA survey asked respondents to indicate prevalence of specific issues, namely depression and stress/anxiety. Of respondents, 49% indicated they felt depressed in the last 30 days and 43% indicated th ey felt anxious or stressed. Depression tends to be rated higher by younger people and for those with less income. Stress and anxiety tend to be rated higher for younger people and those with less income. Respondents were also asked if they spoke with any one about their mental health in the past year . Of respondents 31% indicated that they spoke to someone, the most common response was to a doctor/nurse (5 1%). In regard to self -assessment of overall mental health, 13% of respondents stated they have poor overall mental health. In the 2022 CHNA survey, respondents indicated that mental health was the most important health issue. SUBSTANCE ABUSE. Of survey respondents, 24% indicated they consume at least one alcoholic drink each day. Alcohol consumption ha s no statistically significant correlations with social determinants of health. According to the 2019 County Health Rankings measures, 19% of Delta County residents engaged in excessive drinking in the past 30 days. Of survey respondents, 10% indicated they improperly use prescription medications each day to feel better and 7% indicated the use marijuana each day. Note that misuse of prescription medication (oftentimes opioid use) tends to be rated higher by men, older people, those with a lower education and those with less income. Marijuana use tends to be rated higher by younger people. In the 2022 CHNA survey, respondents rated drug abuse (illegal) as the most prevalent unhealthy behavior (28%) in Delta County, followed by alcohol abuse (22%). ACCESS TO COUNSELING . In the CHNA survey, respondents were asked, \"Was there a time when you needed counseling but were not able to get it?\" Of survey respondents, 19% indicated they were not able CHNA 2022 | Delta County 77 Collaboration for sustaining health equity 2022 to get mental -health counseling when needed. The two most prevalent reasons for not having access to counseling were the inability to find a counselor and the wait for an appointment was too long.
