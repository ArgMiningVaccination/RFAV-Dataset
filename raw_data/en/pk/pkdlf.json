Reiki is an energy healing technique that aids the body in releasing stress and tension by creating a state of deep relaxation, which induces the body's natural self-healing response. Reiki helps balance the life force energy that flows through us to facilitate an environment of healing on all levels (physical, mental, and emotional). Reiki is not a massage; it is a subtle form of energy work that is safe, gentle, and non-invasive.
