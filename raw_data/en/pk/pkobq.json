FY 20 21 Budget Request to Congress Overview - 7 Strategic Infrastructure and Instrumentation In FY 2021, NSF is dedicated to the support of research infrastructure and instrumentation. The Nation's science and engineering activities rely on instrumentation that is geographically and technically accessible, cost effective, an d managed well. To ensure that the infrastructure needs of the entire community are met, NSF supports activities that ensure instrumentation and infrastructure can be designed, developed, acquired, or constructed through programs with focused oversight and investments. Instrumentation and Infrastructure The Major Research Instrumentation (MRI) program is responsible for catalyzing new knowledge and discoveries by helping STEM professionals acquire or develop the instrumentation needed at their institutions . MRI grants support instrumentation in all NSF -supported research disciplines. MRI makes awards of up to $4 million, for projects with total costs (including matching funding) as high as $6 million. In the American Innovation and Competitiveness Act (AI CA) of 2017, Congress directed the agency to develop a strategy for supporting research infrastructure with a total project cost above the upper limit for the MRI program and below the MREFC threshold. NSF responded by introducing the Mid- scale Research Infrastructure (Mid -scale RI) program. This dedicated activity implements a high -priority, agency- wide mechanism that includes upgrades to major facilities as well as stand -alone projects. In FY 2021, NSF will continue funding the Mid -scale Research Infras tructure (Mid -scale RI) program through two tracks. Mid- scale RI Track 1 will support the acquisition or development of instrumentation in the $6 million to $20 million range. Mid -scale RI Track 1 funding is provided through the Research and Related Activitie s account , and awards will fund projects similar to those supported in FY 2019 such as Event Horizon Telescope 2.0, next generation atmospheric research aircraft, and neutron spin-echo spectrometer. Mid-scale RI Track 2 will make awards in the $20 million to $100 million range , and is funded through the MREFC account.

Mid-scale projects in this table have a total implementation cost between $20 million and $100 million. The AIMS ($90.0 million) construction project funding request will support the third year of the multi- year funding profile. Antarctica makes up nearly nine percent of the continental mass of Earth's surface. NSF manages all U.S. activities as a single, integrated program, making Antarctic research possible for scientists supported by NSF and other U.S. agencies. Funding for the AIMS infrastructure improvement project will protect U.S. interests on the continent. It will continue modernization of major facilities at the aging McMurdo Station, much of which was recommended by the U.S. Antarctic Program Blue Ribbon Panel in 2012, so that anticipated science support needs are met for the next three to five decades. When completed, AIMS will enable faster, more streamlined and cost -effective logistical and science support by co- locating or consolidating warehousing, skilled trades work, and field science support where field projects are prepared for movement into the field, into four buildings . AIMS will also provide necessary utilities to support t hese facilities. The LHC ($33.0 million) is the world's largest and highest energy particle accelerator. Located near Geneva, Switzerland and operated by the European Organization for Nuclear Research (CERN), the LHC can accelerate and collide counter -propagating bunches of protons at a total energy of 14 tera -electron volts. A Toroidal LHC ApparatuS (ATLAS) and Compact Muon Solenoid (CMS) are two general purpose detectors used by researchers to observe these collisions and analyze their characteristics. Together , CMS and ATLAS represent the United States contribution to the LHC facility . In FY 202 1, NSF funding together with our Department of Energy partner will support year two of the five -year project for the HL -LHC Upgrade . This investment will upgrade components of the of the ATLAS and CMS detectors , enab ling them to function at much higher collision rates following an upgrade to the LHC to increase its luminosity . The Vera C. Rubin Observatory ($40.75 million) will be an 8 -meter -class wide- field optical telescope capable of carrying out surveys of the entire southern sky. It will collect nearly 40 terabytes of multi -color imaging data every night to produce the deepest, widest -field sky image ever. It will also issue alerts for moving and transient objects within 60 seconds of their discovery. FY 202 1 will be year eight of its nine - year construction funding profile. The Mid-Scale Research Infrastructure ($65.0 million) project has a dedicated funding l ine in the MREFC account for Track 2 awards . Individual projects will be selected through dedicated program solicitations and NSF's merit review process. Although funding will be allocated from the MREFC account , managing directorates will be responsible f or award oversight . FY 20 21 Budget Request to Congress Overview - 9 Big Ideas and Convergence Accelerator In 2021, NSF will continue to invest in its Big Ideas and the Convergence Accelerator, which support bold inquiries into the frontiers of science and engineering. These efforts endeavor to break down the silos of conventional scientific research funded by NSF to embrace the cross- disciplinary and dynamic nature of the science of the future. The Big Ideas represent unique opportunities for the U.S. to define and push the frontiers of global s cience and engineering leadership and to invest in fundamental research. This research will advance the Nation's economic competitiveness, security, and prestige on the global stage. For more information, see the NSF -Wide Investments chapter. About the Bi g Ideas Six of the Big Ideas are research ideas, which will build on the foundation of NSF -funded research over the last 70 years. The Research Big Ideas are complemented by Enabling Big Ideas, which are areas in which research endeavors to improve the way in which science is done, from impacting the workforce to developing the infrastructure that will drive the discoveries and aid the discoverers of tomorrow's science. Research Big Ideas: Harnessing the Data Revolution for 21st -Century Science and Engine ering (HDR ) ($45.0 million) : Engaging NSF's research community in the pursuit of fundamental research in data science and engineering, the development of a cohesive, federated, national -scale approach to research data infrastructure, and the development of a 21st -century data- capable workforce. The Future of Work at the Human Technology Frontier (FW -HTF ) ($45.0 million): Catalyzing interdisciplinary science and engineering research to understand and build the human -technology relationship; design new technologies to augment human performance; illuminate the emerging socio- technological landscape; and foster lifelong and pervasive learning with technology. The Quantum Leap (QL): Leading the Next Quantum Revolution ($50.0 million): Exploiting quantum me chanics to observe, manipulate, and control the behavior of particles and energy at atomic and subatomic scales; and developing next -generation quantum -enabled science and technology for sensing, information processing, communicating, and computing. Navi gating the New Arctic (NNA) ($30.0 million): Establishing an observing network of mobile and fixed platforms and tools, including cyber tools, across the Arctic to document and understand the Arctic's rapid biological, physical, chemical, and social change s, in partnership with other agencies, countries, and native populations. Understanding the Rules of Life (URoL): Predicting Phenotype ($30.0 million): Elucidating the sets of rules that predict an organism's observable characteristics. Advances in under standing life at the fundamental level of the genome will enable re -engineering of cells, organisms, and ecosystems, and innovative biochemicals and biomaterials that sustain a vibrant bioeconomy and strengthen society. Windows on the Universe (WoU): The Era of Multi -messenger Astrophysics ($30.0 million): Using powerful new syntheses of observational approaches to provide unique insights into the nature and behavior of matter and energy and to answer some of the most profound questions before humankind. Overview Overview - 10 Enabling Big Ideas: NSF INCLUDES ($18.92 million): Transforming education and career pathways to help broaden participation in science and engineering and build a diverse, highly skilled American workforce . Growing Convergence Research at NSF (GCR) ($15.20 million): Merging ideas, approaches, tools, and technologies from widely diverse fields of science and engineering to stimulate discovery and innovation. Mid-scale Research Infrastructure ($97.67 million): Developing an agile process for funding experimental research capabilities in the mid -scale range, spanning the midscale gap in research infrastructure. This is a \"sweet spot\" for science and engineering that has been challenging to fund through traditional NSF programs. About the Convergence Accelerator The Convergence Accelerator (CA) is an organizational framework that stands separately from the NSF research directorates, with its own budget, staff, and initiatives. Each CA research track will be a time - limited entity focused on specific resear ch topics and themes. Therefore, CA research tracks will evolve over time and will be informed by external stakeholder input . The CA will reward high -risk, innovative thinking by multidisciplinary teams of researchers who want to accelerate discovery and i nnovation. The CA is a way of achieving rapid lab- to-market or research outcomes. The FY 2021 CA funding is $70.0 million , or $28.61 million above the FY 2019 Actual . NSF anticipates external partners will begin contributing f inancially to the effort in FY 2021. FY 20 21 Budget Request to Congress Overview - 11 Education and STEM Workforce NSF's education and STEM workforce investments are primarily housed in the Directorate for Education and Human Resources, but represent agency -wide investments in the education of tomorrow's scientists, engineers, and educators. NSF is committed to buildin g and leveraging a diverse, highly skilled American workforce for the 21st century economy. This workforce must be capable of adapting to the increasingly technical nature of work across all sectors, which will require a greater emphasis on STEM education and literacy . NSF works to prioritize programs that will provide experiential learning opportunities, as well as programs that prioritize computer science education and reskilling. NSF 's extensive broadening participation portfolio impacts minority serving institutions and rural communities . Priority STEM education activities to prepare America's future workforce in FY 2021 are: The Advanced Technological Education (ATE ) ($70.97 million) program focuses on the education of technicians for the high -technology fields that drive our N ation's economy. The program involves partnerships between academic institutions and industry to promote improvement in the education of science and engineering technicians at the undergraduate and secondary institution school levels. The ATE program supports curriculum development; professional development of college faculty and secondary school teachers; career pathways; and other activities. The NSF Research Traineeship (NRT) ($61.87 million) program encourage s the development and implementation of bold, new, and potentially transformative and scalable models for STEM graduate education training. The program is dedicated to effective training of STEM graduate students in high priority interdisciplinary or convergent research ar eas through innovative professional development activities that will educate the next generation of scientist . In FY2021, NRT will expand to include a special focus on traineeships in artificial intelligence and artificial intelligence engineering. The CyberCorps\u00ae: Scholarship for Service (SFS) ($52.13 million) program supports cybersecurity education at higher education institutions. SFS also focuses on workforce development by increasing the number of qualified students entering the fields of information assurance and cybersecurity, which enhances the capacity of the U.S. higher education enterprise to continue to produce professionals in these fields to secure the Nation's cyberinfrastructure. Computer Science for All ( CSforAll) : Researcher and Research Practitioner Partnerships ($18.97 million) will build on ongoing efforts to enable rigorous and engaging computer science education in schools across the Nation, to prepare the STEM workforce of the future. CSforAll aims to provide high school teachers with the preparation, professional development, and ongoing suppor t that they need to teach rigorous computer science courses and to give preK -8 teachers the instructional materials and preparation they need to integrate computer science and computational thinking into their teaching. The Graduate Research Fellowship Program (GRFP) ($275.28 million) recognizes students with high potential in STEM research and innovation and provides support for them to pursue research across all science and engineering disciplines. GRFP fellows may participate in Graduate Research Opport unities Worldwide (GROW), which provides opportunities to conduct research with international partner countries and organizations, and Graduate Research Internship Program (GRIP), which provides professional development through research internships at fede ral agencies. In FY 2021, GRFP will continue to align fellowship awards with NSF and Administration research priorities, including IotF research areas of artificial intelligence and quantum information science. Overview Overview - 12 The Hispanic -Serving Institutions Program ( HSI) ($14.19 million) seeks to enhance the quality of undergraduate STEM education at HSIs and to increase retention and graduation rates of undergraduate students pursuing degrees in STEM fields at HSIs. The HSI Program seeks to build capacity at HSIs tha t typically do not receive high levels of NSF grant funding. The Historically Black Colleges and Universities Undergraduate Program (HBCU -UP) ($31.22 million) is committed to enhancing the quality of undergraduate STEM education and research at HBCUs to broaden participation in the nation's STEM workforce. HBCU -UP provides awards to develop, implement, and study evidence -based innovative models and approaches for improving the preparation and success of HBCU undergraduate students so that they may pursue STEM graduate programs and/or careers. The Improving Undergraduate STEM Education (IUSE) ($ 88.21 million) initiative supports the development of the STEM and STEM -capable workforce by investing in the improvement of undergraduate STEM education, with a focus on attracting and retaining students and on degree completion. The initiative funds the development an d implementation and the related research and assessment of effectiveness. Directorates across NSF invest in this program to support the development of a workforce that will be able to handle the real -world challenges of a STEM career. The Tribal College s and Universities Program (TCUP) ($12.49 million) provides awards to Tribal Colleges and Universities, Alaska Native- serving institutions, and Native Hawaiian- serving institutions to promote high quality STEM education, research, and outreach. FY 20 21 Budget Request to Congress Overview - 13 Agency O perations and Award Management In FY 2021, funding provides a total of $345.64 million, an increase of $12.95 million or 3.9 percent above the FY 2019 Actual for the Agency Operations and Award Management (AOAM) account. NSF continues to operate as a lea n agency with AOAM costs representing 4.5 percent of NSF total FY 2021 budget. Investments in the AOAM account provide the fundamental framework through which the Foundation's science and engineering research and education programs are administered. AOAM funds the essential services NSF needs to operate, and investments in the AOAM account continue to be an NSF priority. The AOAM account enables NSF to support innovations and workforce development essential to improving agency operations and advancing American leadership in science and technology . The $7.4 billion in research funding that NSF will support in FY 2021 is made possible by the federal staff that enable the research and steward the taxpayer investment. The AOAM account provid es the funding necessary to support NSF the institution, which is largely the cost of NSF personnel and NSF headquarter location in Alexandria, VA. These fixed costs increase year over year and are partially offset by reductions to the mission -support services necessary to operate the agency and support the NSF workforce. In FY 2021, AOAM will also fund NSF's efforts to implement the policy requirements mandated by law, such as the American Innovation and Competitiveness Act (AICA) , Digital Accountability a nd Transparency Act of 2014 (DATA Act), Foundations for Evidence -Based Policymaking Act of 2018 (Evidence Act) . $255.0 2020 Request FY 2021 RequestAOAM Funding ($ millions) Staffing and Space Rental ServicesOverview Overview - 14 Organization and Role in the Federal Research Enterprise NSF's comprehensive and flexible support of meritorious projects enables the Foundation to identify and foster both fundamental and transformative discoveries and broader impacts within and among fields of inquiry. NSF has the latitude to support emerging fields, high- risk ideas, interdisciplinary collaborations, and re search that pushes\u2014 and creates \u2014the very frontiers of knowledge. In these ways, NSF's discoveries inspire the American public \u2014and the world. NSF's organization represents the major science and engineering fields, including biological sciences; computer and information science and engineering; engineering; geosciences; mathematical and physical sciences; and social, behavioral, and economic scie nces. NSF also carries out specific responsibilities for education and human resources, integrative activities, and international science and engineering. The 25- member National Science Board approves the overall policies of the Foundation. NSF's annual budget represents approximately 25 percent of the total federal budget for basic research conducted at U.S. colleges and universities. In many science and engineering fields, NSF is the primary source of federal academic support. FY 20 21 Budget Request to Congress Overview - 15 NSF by the Numbers NSF by the Numbers: In FY 2021, NSF expects to evaluate approximately 43,500 proposals through a competitive merit review process and make approximately 10,7 00 new competitive awards, 8,1 00 of which will be new research grants and the remainder of which will be contracts and cooperative agreements. This process involves approximately 192,000 proposal reviews , engaging on the order of 29,000 members of the science and engineering community participating as panelists and proposal reviewers. In a given year, NSF awards reach over 1,800 colleges, universities, and other public and private institutions in 50 states, the District of Columbia, and U.S. territories. In FY 202 1, NSF support is expected to reach approximately 299,900 researchers, postdoctoral fellows, trainees, teachers, and students. The chart on the right shows the distribution of NSF's obligations by institution type and funding mechanism. While the data are based on FY 2019, it is expected that the relative shares in FY 2021 will be similar. As shown on the graph, 95 percent of NSF's FY 2019 projects were funded using grants or cooperative agreements. NSF grants are either standard or continuing awards. That is, the award is made during one fiscal year for the full amount of the award or made ove r several years in increments. Cooperative agreements are used when the project requires substantial agency involvement during the project performance period (e.g., research centers, major multi -user research facilities). Contracts are used to acquire products, services, and studies (e.g., program evaluations) required primarily for NSF or other government use. Most NSF awards are to academic institutions. As shown in the chart, 78 percent of support for research and education programs ($ 6,079 million) was to colleges (including two - year and community colleges), universities, and academic consortia. Private industry, including small businesses, accounted for 1 3 percent ($998 million ), and support to Federally Funded Research and Development Centers (FFRDCs) accounted for four percent ($ 308 million). Other recipients included federal, state, and local governments; nonprofit organizations; and international organizations. A small numbe r of awards fund research in collaboration with other countries, which adds value to the U.S. scientific enterprise and maintains U.S. leadership in the global scientific enterprise. Overview Overview - 16 The chart on the left presents a high - level, agency -wide estimate of funding rates, or proposal \"success,\" as a comparison of the number of competitive proposals, new awards, and funding rate between FY 2019, FY 2020, and FY 2021. In FY 2021, NSF expects to make approximately 10.700 new awards, which corresponds to a funding rate of about 25 percent . FY 20 21 Budget Request to Congress Overview - 17 Highlights For 70 years, NSF has invested in fundamental research and education to fulfill its mission of promoting the progress of science and engineering. In doing so, NSF-supported research has connected the discovery and advancement of knowledge with the potential societal, economic, and educational benefits that are critical for continued U.S. prosperity. Below are a few examples of the important advances that NSF funding enables. Astronomers capture first image of a b lack hole The Event Horizon Telescope (EHT) was designed to see the unseeable. Black holes exert such strong gravitational forces that even light can't escape them. It took EHT, a planet - scale array of eight ground -based radio telescopes linked through international collaboration, to gather the first direct visual evidence of a supermassive black hole and its shadow, 55 million light -years from Earth. EHT uses very -long- baseline interferometry (VLBI), which synchronizes telescope facilities around the world to form one huge, Earth -size telescope. Decades of NSF investments in VLBI and radio astronomy technologies led to the creation of EHT and the black -hole image. In 2019, EHT's members received the Breakthrough Prize in Fundamental Physics, an annual recognition of scientific achievements. Their next goals include imaging the supermassive black hole at the center of the Milky Way and capturing video of a black hole. Working with industry to strengthen the STEM workforce Across the U.S., industries increasingly depend on rapidly changing technology, creating pressure for employers to find wor kers with STEM skills and knowledge. To empower the workers of today to hold the jobs of tomorrow, a unique public -private partnership will develop online learning platforms and study the effectiveness of courseware to see what connects with learners of di fferent ages and skill levels. Using a $10 million gift from The Boeing Company, NSF funded five separate projects exploring approaches that will allow schools, companies, nonprofits and others to create new learning experiences to build a stronger, more STEM -educated workforce. Using the EHT, scientists obtained an image of the black hole at the center of galaxy M87, outlined by emission from hot gas swirling around it under the influence of strong gravity near its event horizon.

Kabir Overview Overview - 18 Robots with a softer touch Soft robotics have the potential to revolutionize the way we live, creating machines robust enough to work in healthcare or manufacturing, yet safe to use around people. But for years, their increased dexterity and flexibility came at a cost: reduced strength. NSF -funded researchers found a way around that, though. Using origami as their inspiration, they have created artificial muscles that allow soft robots to lift objects that are up to 1,000 times their own weight \u2014using only air or water pressure. Each artificial muscle consists of an inner \"skeleton\" surrounded by air or fluid and sealed inside a \"skin.\" The shape and composition of the skeleton determines the muscle's movement. Adaptable, scalable, and presenting comparably little damage if they break, these soft robots could help humans do everything from gently lifting the injured out of hospital beds to assembling cars. Frontera: Fastest academic supercomputer in the world Scientific challenges increasingly demand more computing power. The U.S. science and engineering community gained a major resource in 2019 when the Texas Advanced Computing Center (TACC) launched Frontera, the most powerful supercomputer on any academic campus and the fifth fastest system in the world. Supported by NSF, Frontera serves as a tool that will enable discoveries by researchers from across the country. Within weeks of coming online, the system had already enabled research in areas ranging from black hole physics to drug design, leveraging data analytics and artificial intelligence capabilities. It has already performed simulations of neutron stars merging and helped train neural networks to predict the characteristics of new drug compounds. Frontera is expected to have a major effect on fields including natural hazards modeling, genomics, astrophysics, and materials sciences. Frontera is the most powerful supercomputer on any academic campus and the fifth fastest system in the world.

For a group of internati onal researchers who set sail in 2019, it was the launchpad for the largest polar expedition in the world. Hundreds of researchers, including NSF- supported scientists from the U.S., boarded the German research vessel Polarstern for the MOSAiC (Multidiscipl inary drifting Observatory for the Study of Arctic Climate) expedition, a year-long operation that required lengthy logistical preparation by NSF staff and their international partners. Researchers worked to set up an observational network monitoring air, land, and sea that stretched over the sea ice as far as 30 miles away from the research vessel. MOSAiC aims to produce breakthroughs in understanding the Arctic climate system. World's largest outdoor shake table Earthquakes don't just shake the ground horizontally. They heave it vertically and twist it in ways that can tear buildings apart. Now, thanks to a $16.5 million award from NSF, the world's largest outdoor earthquake simulator, located at the University of California (UC) San Diego, does too. The upgrade will enable this \"shake table\" to more realistically recreate the ground motio ns of an earthquake. It will allow engineers to test structures from multi -story buildings to bridge columns and wind turbines to find out how resilient they are to earthquake conditions. The enhanced shake table would teach researchers new lessons even if they just repeated the more than 30 tests conducted since 2004. The engineers working on the upgrade already have a plan for the first structure they'll test with it - a 10- story building made from cross laminated timber. A graduate student inspects a six -story steel -framed building that is about to be tested on a shake table.

Hoppmann Overview Overview - 20 New tools to minimize risks in shared, augmented reality environments Augmented reality (AR) has, thus far, largely been deployed in the context of individuals playing popular video ga mes that allow them to use smart phones or other devices to see virtual objects in the physical world around them. But soon this technology may find applications where groups are using it for learning, commerce or industry \u2014which makes it all the more impor tant to figure out how to safeguard AR from hackers and others who would hijack it or breach the privacy of users. NSF -supported researchers are laying the groundwork for a safe AR universe. Their new toolkit, known as ShareAR, lets app developers build in AR features without sacrificing their users' privacy and security. ShareAR is the first of its kind as it takes into account the unique security issues associated with augmented reality, such as the idea that attackers could add malicious or inappropriate items into the virtual environments. Collision -detecting suitcase For the visually impaired, unfamiliar environments can prove difficult to navigate. A team of NSF -supported researchers are working to make at least one of those environments safer, with a smart suitcase that warns blind users of impending collisions, along with a wayfinding smartphone app for safe and independent navigation through airport terminals. The rollin g suitcase sounds alarms when users are headed for a collision with a pedestrian, and the navigation app provides turn-by-turn audio instructions to users on how to reach a departure gate \u2014or a restroom or a restaurant. The app, known as NavCong, employs airports' Bluetooth beacons, for navigation waypoints. The team tested ShareAR with three case study apps. One of the apps is Doc Edit (above), which lets users create virtual notes or lists they can share or keep private; the semi - transparent gray box in the top left corner represents a \"ghost object,\" or a document that another user wishes to remain private.

While broadening participation is included in the NSF review criteria, some program announcements and solicitations go beyond the standard criteria. They range from encouraging language to specific requirements. Investments range from capacity building, research centers, partnerships, and alliances to the use of co -funding or supplements to existing awards in the core research programs. NSF's broadening participation portfolio can be divided into three categories: (1) Focused, (2) Emphases, and (3) Geographic Diversity. The following sections define each of these categories and provide a list of the progra ms and activities with their respective funding levels that comprise each.

With this solicitation, the National Science Foundation (NSF) focuses on researcher -practitioner partnerships (RPPs) that foster the research and development needed to bring CS and CT to all schools. Specifically, this solicitation aims to provide high school teachers with the preparation, professional development (PD) and ongoing support that they need to teach rigorous computer science courses; preK -8 teache rs with the instructional materials and preparation they need to integrate CS and CT into their teaching; and schools and districts the resources needed to define and evaluate multi - grade pathways in CS and CT.\" The revised solicitation added the focus o n researcher -practitioner partnerships that are supporting schools and districts in defining and evaluating multi -grade pathways in CS and CT. Clear pathways for coursework and other experiences in CS and CT - from elementary to middle school, middle to h igh school, and high school into the first years of college - are important for educators to support systemic implementation of CS and CT in schools. Metrics The program team developed and reported s hort-, mid -, and longer -term metrics for success as follows: Short -term metrics will focus on ensuring that the program is making awards in the four areas outlined in the law and that the awards address the goal of broadening participation in computer science. One indicator of broadening participation is the diversi ty of the populations supported educationally in the awards. Mid-term metrics will include the extent to which funded projects are achieving goals as measured by the progress reported in NSF's required annual and final project reports. Longer -term (beyond five years) metrics will include an evaluation of the outcomes of the program, which are based on the program aims as described in the program solicitation and the requirements of Public Law 114- 329. Program staff are working with the Evaluation and Monit oring group within NSF's Directorate for Education and Human Resources and Evaluation and Assessment Capability within NSF's Office of Integrative Activities to develop (1) a set of specific longer -term metrics and (2) a program evaluation plan for measuri ng the collective success of the CSforAll: RPP projects using these longer -term metrics. Report on the Success of the Program as Measured by the Short -Term Metrics Between the submission of the last annual report and December 2019, 31 new awards were mad e by the program in FY 2019 pursuant to NSF 18- 537. Below is a summary of the FY 2019 CSforAll: RPP projects [Note: some awards address more than one of the goals described in (b)(2)A -D, so the number of awards sums to more than 31] : 9 awards address subsection (b)(2)A and (b)(2)B; 20 awards address subsection (b)(2)C; and 9 awards address multi -grade pathways to CT and CS . Finally, all new awards served at least one underrepresented or underserved group, as outlined in the table below (Note: some awards serve more than one underrepresented group, so the number of awards in the table sum to more than 31 ).

Specifically, the report itemizes (1) a description of the program strategy and objectives; (2) a description of the awards made in the previous fiscal year including (A) the total amount made available, by state, under EPSCoR; (B) the total amount of agency funding made available to all institutions and entities within each EPSCo R state; (C) the efforts and accomplishments to more fully integrate the EPSCoR states in major agency activities and initiatives; (D) the percentage of EPSCoR reviewers from EPSCoR states; (E) the number of programs or large collaborator awards involving a partners hip of organizations and institutions from EPSCoR and non- EPSCoR states; and (3) an analysis of the gains in academic research quality and competitiveness, and in science and technology human resource development, achieved by the program over the last 5 years . Introduction EPSCoR utilizes three investment strategies in pursuit of its goal to strengthen research capacity and competitiveness in eligible jurisdictions. These investment strategies are: (1) Research Infrastructure Improvement (RII) awards that su pport physical, human, and cyberinfrastructure development; (2) Co- Funding in partnership with NSF directorates and offices that support individual investigators and groups within EPSCoR jurisdictions; and (3) Outreach activities and workshops that bring E PSCoR jurisdiction investigators together with program staff from across the Foundation to explore opportunities in emerging areas of science and engineering aligned with NSF strategic priorities and with jurisdictional science and technology goals. EPSCo R Strategies a nd Objectives (Sec. 103(d)(1)). c EPSCoR's strategies and objectives in FY 201 9 remain the same a s those described in the FY 2018 report. Specifically, the mission of EPSCoR is \"to enhance research competitiveness of targeted jurisdictions (states, territories, commonwealths) by strengthening STEM capacity and capability. \" Thus, EPSCoR's goals are: To catalyze the development of research capabilities and the creation of new knowledge that expands jurisdictions' contributions to scientific disc overy, innovation, learning, and knowledge -based prosperity. To establish sustainable Science, Technology, Engineering and Math (STEM) education, training, and professional development pathways that advance jurisdiction -identified research areas, NSF focus areas, and workforce development. To broaden direct participation of diverse individuals, institutions, and organizations in the project's science and engineering research and education initiatives. To effect sustainable engagement of project participants and partners, the jurisdiction, the national research community, and the general public through data -sharing, communication, outreach, and dissemination. NSF Authorizations Authorizations - 10 To impact research, education, and economic development beyond the project at academic, government, and private sector levels. NSF Funding Made Available, by jurisdiction , under EPSCoR (Sec. 103(d)(2)(A)) . In FY 2019, NSF EPSCoR invested a total of $ 175.67 million in support of its programmatic activities. Of this, $14 4.94 million ( 82.5 percent) was directed to RII, million ( 17.4 percent) to co -funding, and $120,000 (0.1 percent) to outreach activities and workshops.

In FY 2019, NSF invested a total of $915 .70 million in support of EPSCoR jurisdictions. The table below details NSF investments in EPSCoR jurisdictions including research support funding, education and human resources, and major research equipment. FY 2021 Budget Request to Congress Authorizations - 11 EPSCoR Jurisdiction NSF Funding AK $62.20 AL 58.99 AR 19.72 Funding Made Available to All EPSCoR Jurisdictions (Dollars in Millions) Integration of EPSCoR Jurisdictions in Major Activities and Initiatives of the Foundation (Sec. 103 (d)(2)(C)). All EPSCoR programmatic activities target integration and assimilation of EPSCoR jurisdictions into the research and education programs of the Foundation's disciplinary directorates. RII awards promote the coordination and integration of recipient jurisdictions into major NSF programmatic activities. Additionally, EPSCoR consults and engages NSF disciplinary program officers (POs) in merit review processes and post -award evaluations, such as site visits and reverse site visits (RSVs). Site visits and RSVs are intended to provide additional project oversight by allowing jurisdictions to report on the progress of their RII projects in relation to their stated goals and the programmatic terms and conditions. Disciplinary POs assist in the identification of reviewers, serve as site visit and RSV observers, and provide knowledge about the ongoing activities within the directorate that c ould be leveraged to sustain RII efforts after the performance period of the EPSCoR award. National, regional, and jurisdictional meetings of the EPSCoR community facilitate grantee interactions with NSF leadership to learn about the Foundation's strateg ic priorities and funding opportunities. Participation by EPSCoR researchers and educators in the merit review process across all disciplinary domains of the Foundation, in Committees of Visitors (COV) activities, in external advisory (Federal Advisory Com mittee Act) committees, and in disciplinary workshops that shape new activities is also vital to this integration. NSF Authorizations Authorizations - 12 Outreach to EPSCoR jurisdictions by NSF staff promotes integration of the EPSCoR community into mainstream NSF programs, as does co- funding of awards with the disciplinary programs of the Foundation. There is also an effort to promote in -reach, whereby EPSCoR facilitates opportunities for researchers and educators from EPSCoR jurisdictions to meet with NSF staff at the Foundation's headquarte rs. In these meetings, the EPSCoR participants are provided with information on NSF strategic priorities and funding opportunities. In FY 2019, EPSCoR staff promote d engagement of the EPSCoR community in NSF and other national activities. Examples are: Convened a regional outreach meeting, \"All About NSF Research Center Programs ,\" in Mobile, AL. The event provided extensive information about the various NSF Center programs and was intended to help pave the way for EPSCoR researchers to take the next steps in leveraging their current funding and research to create a culture of sustainability and move onto the next big project. Over 80 participants attended, representing 17 jurisdictions. Hosted its annual principal investigator meeting, a two- day event with opportunities for the EPSCoR community and NSF program officers to interact and share best practices in strategic planning, diversity, communication, evaluation, and other areas of importance to EPSCoR jurisdictions and NSF. Supported planning for the 26th NSF EPSCoR National Conference, in Col umbia, SC , in October 2019. The theme of the conference was Science and P artnerships across D isciplinary Boundaries and ~400 faculty, staff, students and postdoctoral scholars from all EPSCoR jurisdictions and RII Tracks as well as interested stakeholders attended. Encourage d EPSCoR -supported faculty to participate in NSF committee and review panels across NSF (e.g., COVs, site visits, and merit review panels). Continued the RII Track -2: collaborative teams of EPSCoR investigators in scientific focus areas consistent with NSF priorities. In addition, these awards have a par ticular focus on the development of early c areer/junior faculty. In FY 2019, proposals were invited on the topic of \" Harnessing big data to solve problems of national importance ,\" aligned with the NSF Big Idea of Harnessing the Data Revolution , and ten awards were made. Continue d the RII Track -4, EPSCoR Research Fellows solicitation , which provides opportunities for early career researchers to further develop their individual research potential through extended collaborative visits to the N ation's premier private, governmental, or academic research centers. Proposals in all areas of science and engineering supported by NSF were invited and awards for the FY 2019 competition were made with next year funding. Convened two meetings with the EPSCoR Interagency Coordinating Committee (EICC) to share relevant program information and identify opport unities for coordination. EPSCoR Reviewers (Sec. 103(d)(2)(D)). Demographics of all reviewers who evaluated EPSCoR proposals or the program in FY 2019 are as follows: of the 114 reviewers, 19 percent were underrepresented minorities, 46 percent were female, 1 8 percent were from EPSCoR jurisdictions . FY 2021 Budget Request to Congress Collaborations and Pa rtnerships (Sec. 103(d)(2)(E)). All RII awards involve collaborations amo ng scientists and engineers in EPSCoR jurisdictions. Additionally, RII awards require institutional collaborations, which are defined as collaborations between researchers at a RII awardee or sub- awardee and those at institutions not receiving any RII funds. In FY 2019, there were 519 institutional collaborations within EPSCoR jurisdictions; 557 institutional non- EPSCoR 20 collaborations between institutions in EPSCoR jur isdictions and in foreign countries. These collaborative efforts highlight the vast network of institutional involvement among EPSCoR jurisdictions and their partners in RII projects. Among the 185 awards co -funded by EPSCoR in FY 2019, 77 involved colla borative research between multiple institutions. Of those 77 collaborative awards, 5 4 were collaborations between investigators from institutions in EPSCoR and non- EPSCoR jurisdictions. An analysis of the gains in academic research quality and competitiv eness, and in science and technology human resource development, achieved by the program over the last 5 fiscal years (Sec. 103(d)(3)). Eligibility to participate in NSF EPSCoR programmatic activities is based upon the jurisdictions' demonstrated ability to obtain NSF research funds. Currently, a jurisdiction is eligible to participate in EPSCoR programs if its level of NSF research suppor t is equal to or less than 0.75 percent of the total NSF research and related activities budget over the most recent three- year period. Given EPSCoR's aim to stimulate research that is fully competitive in NSF's disciplinary and multidisciplinary research programs, increases in the ability to capture NSF research funds serve as a proxy for gai ns in research competitiveness. As in FY 2018, former EPSCoR jurisdictions Missouri, Tennessee, and Utah exceeded the 0.75 percent threshold and continued to be ineligible to compete in new FY 201 9 RII competitions. In FY 201 9, both Iowa and New Mexico , which had both been ineligible in FY 2018, fell back below the 0.75 percent eligibility threshold . Figure 1 (below) shows the average amoun t of NSF research funds by cohort for the initial five years (hatched bars) and the most recent five years (solid bars) of their participation in the NSF EPSCoR Program. A cohort is defined as the group of states or jurisdictions that entered the EPSCoR pr ogram within a given fiscal year. For example, the 1980 cohort consists of the initial five states that qualified for EPSCoR: Arkansas, Maine, Montana, South Carolina, and West Virginia. For this summary, the 2000+ cohort consists of jurisdictions that ent ered EPSCoR in FY 2000 or later and are still EPSCoR -eligible for RII competitions : Alaska, Delaware, Guam, Hawaii, New Hampshire, Rhode Island, and the U.S. Virgin Islands. Former EPSCoR jurisdictions Missouri, Tennessee, and Utah are excluded because the y were no longer EPSCoR -eligible in FY 2019. Each cohort shows an increase in competitiveness over the periods of participation. For example, the 1980 cohort shows a 6 6 percent increase in NSF r esearch funding over the past 39 years of EPSCoR activity. The 1985 cohort (Alabama, Kentucky, Nevada, North Dakota, Oklahoma, Puerto Rico, Vermont, and Wyoming) demonstrates a 59 percent increase during its 34 years of participation in EPSCoR. The 1987 cohort (Idaho, Louisiana, Mississippi, and South Dakota) shows a 69 percent increase over the past 32 years, while the 1992 cohort (Kansas and Nebraska) has a 64 percent increas e in competitiveness over its 27 years of EPSCoR involvement. Currently eligible j urisdictions participating in EPSCoR since FY 2000 entered into the program at a higher level of NSF research funding than the previous cohorts. For the 2000+ cohort, there has been a small, yet demonstrable 25 percent increase in research funding. NSF Authorizations Authorizations - 14 Figure 1.

The following table demonstrates the quantifiable outputs of NSF EPSCoR's RII Track- 1 program over the last five fiscal years. This information elucidates the gains in academic research quality over time, as defined by publications, leveraged grants, and patents. For publica tions, primary support is defined as research that is directly funded by EPSCoR and partial support is defined as use of equipment or facilities funded by EPSCoR. The number and valuation of grants awarded encompass all federal, private industry, and priva te foundation awards across the U.S. in a given fiscal year for all EPSCoR jurisdictions.

The table below indicates EPSCoR's ongoing support of human resource development over the last five fiscal years in the RII Track -1 program. The number of faculty and students involved in RII Track- 1 projects has remained fairly constant over time, signify ing a strong commitment by NSF and the jurisdictions in strengthening jurisdictional human capital in science and engineering research and education.

In FY 2019, EPSCoR undertook a re-examination of its eligibility methodology1 to ensure that it is simple, transparent, fair, and stable. NSF is implementing changes that incorporate stakeholder feedback and are supported by robust data analyses. The new eligibility table utilizing the improved methodology will be published in February 2020 and will apply to the FY 2021 EPSCoR competitions. The FY 2020 eligibility will be the same as FY 2019. NSF EPSCoR is continuing to refine and imple ment a cohesive Research Competitiveness evaluation framework for the program. This evaluation, once completed in 2020, will address the legislative objective of increasing the research competitiveness of jurisdictions receiving EPSCoR funding by (1) devel oping a flexible framework to explore, define, and measure research competitiveness in relation to each unique jurisdictional context, and (2) using evidence of jurisdictional progress toward research competitiveness over time for strategic program improve ment. The evaluation builds on the findings and recommendations from the EPSCoR retrospective evaluation completed by the Science and Technology Policy Institute in 2012. The contract for this new, forward looking evaluation has been underway since 2017. K ey activities to date include identification, merging , and cleaning of data sets, descriptive and correlational analyses, refinement of the logic model for the research competitiveness framework , and development of a data dashboard tool to visualize output s. The study report is expected to be finalized in April 2020. 1 Description of redefined EPSCoR eligibility methodology is available at www.nsf.gov/od/o ia/programs/epscor/Eligibility_Tables/EPSCoR_Eligibility_Methodology.pdf RRA - 1 RESEARCH AND RELATED ACTIVITIES ) $6,213,020,000 -$365,110 ,000 / -5.6% The FY 20 21 Budget Request for the Research and Related Activities account is $ 6,213.02 million .

In the past decade biology has been transformed by new tools to describe and manipulate genomes, new means of sensing processes at multiple biological scales simultaneously, and new computational and artificial intelligence (AI) approaches in bioinformatics and modeling to unveil the regulation of complex living systems. BIO seeks to capitalize on these advances to vastly improve our ability to understand life's deepest mysteries, and to enable new capabilities to modify organisms and ecosystems for societal benefit and economic prosperity. BIO investments in genomics, in cellular, organismal and developmental biology, and in bioinformatics spur further development of capabilities in synthetic biology and enhance biotechnology b eyond the current state-of-the-art. The accelerating power of this advanced biotechnology promises to sustain U.S. economic growth and innovation across multiple sectors including agriculture, biomanufacturing, pharmaceuticals, and other bioproducts. In th is way, BIO programs directly support the A dministration 's priorities in and the bioeconomy industries of the future . BIO investments in ecology, evolution and biodiversity, including support for the National Ecological Observatory Network (NEON), promote the development of dynamic, eco-forecasting models to predict environmental change at regional and continental scales. These investments support the Administration 's priority to advance Earth System Predictability, and address gaps in national security concerning the environmental spread and evolution of biothreats and engineered organisms. Biological questions often drive convergence research in critical areas of sc ience and technology and stimulate applications that enhance economic and societal well -being. Pursuit s in the biological sciences to quantify living systems at all scales has propelled the frontiers of research in statistics and mathematical and computer sciences to consider larger and more complex data sets that benefit from machine learning. Foundational research on microbes and their interactions with plants leverages these advances in data analytics using AI and advanced computing to fuel a revolution in agriculture. Similarly, collaborations between the biological and physical sciences have contributed to advances such as biological computing, taking advantage of the extraordinary information density in genetic polymers, and the development of neuro- technologies that are powering advances in neuroscience and cognition. Quantum biology\u2014 the application of quantum theory to biological systems \u2014provides new insights into the power of photosynthesis for energy production as well as a fundamental understanding of vision, olfaction, Directorate for Biological Sciences BIO - 2 magnetoreception, and other sensing systems. This research will enable bioinspired designs based on quantum energy production and sensing systems that will enhance American security. As the lead directorate for the URoL Big Idea, BIO provides the stewardship support for URoL, an NSF - wide, convergence research funding opportunity addressing scientific and societal needs pertinent to the Administration 's priorit ies in the bioeconomy. URoL is focused on elucidating the rules that govern the emergence of complex organismal traits and behaviors, such as robustness and adaptability, using a highly interdisciplinary approach that engages all the major disciplines represented across NSF's directorates and offices. URoL frames the essential challenges and opportunities associated with genotype to phenotype (structure to function) relationships. Through stewardship of URoL, BIO enables research that leads to a predictive understanding of biologica l systems at all scales. This knowledge is what drives advances in understanding the human body and improving health, enabling sustainable and efficient food production, and harnessing biological systems to enable bio -based manufacturing and new forms of e nergy production. BIO also invests in Biology Integration Institutes (BII) to enable the discovery of underlying principles operating across all hierarchical levels of life, from biomolecules to organisms to ecosystems. Unlike URoL, BII provides institute -scale funding to address the critical need for integration within biology itself , both integration of approaches across scales that will enable biology to become a predictive science, and also cultural integration across the traditional sub -disciplines of biology that will propel significant advances in the life sciences. BII will provide support for research and training to promote this integrative biology through highly collaborative, team -science endeavors, which foster diversity and inclusion in science. This complements BIO's other investments in workforce development, including postdoctoral fellowships and research experiences for undergraduates. BIO promotes other opportunities for convergence research and training through active participation and foundational investments in several Big Ideas beyond URoL. BIO participates in QL \u2014contributing to more efficient and robust quantum technologies for solar energy harvesting, communication, and navigation as well as cutting edge DNA -based quantum computing. BIO will support basic research in this area primarily through established research programs in MCB and research resource programs in DBI. BIO is making strategic investments in HDR \u2014from contributing to the mapping and understanding of the properties, structure, and functions of tens of thousands of molecules in cells, to collecting and analyzing data from leading facilities such as NEON, which provides data on environmental and land use change for the entire United States. BIO investments include CyVerse, Protein Data Bank, iDigBio, and Advancing Digitization of Biodiversity Collections. BIO participates in the NNA Big Idea through investments in environmental research and observational infrastructure in the Arctic, through the Long- Term Ecological Research program (LTER) and NEON. For more information about the Big Ideas, please see the narratives in the NSF-Wide Investments chapter.

As outlined in the forward -looking computational ecosystem blueprint released in FY 2019 ,29 NSF currently invests in three broad and complementary ad vanced computing areas that enable it to meet these continually evolving needs in an agile yet predictable way . These investments complement each other as well as discipline-specific investments by NSF's directorates, mission -specific investments by other agencies, and cumulatively extensive, but individually smaller, investments by academic institutions at the regional and campus levels. Specifically, the se areas are: Leadership -Class Computing which aims to provide unique services and resources to advance the largest and most computationally-intensive science and engineering research frontiers not otherwise possible; Advanced/Innovative Computing Systems and Services which aims to provide a technically diverse and potentially future -looking advanced comput ing portfolio, reflecting the growing and changing use of computation and data in both the research and education processes, and capable of supporting hundreds to thousands of investigators conducting cutting-edge science and engineering research; and Coor dination and Support Services which aims to coordinate the provisioning, allocation, and operations of NSF's advanced computing resources, providing advanced assistance to the user community, supporting aggregation and federation capabilities, enabling the translation of CI research advances, and broadening participation. Leadership -Class Computing Description Leadership -class computing systems have represented a key component of NSF's computational portfolio for decades. NSF's current leadership -class computing system is Frontera , which is deployed at the Texas Advanced Computing Center (TACC) at the University of Texas at Austin (UT Austin) . Frontera is one of the most powerful supercomputers in the world and is the most powerful supercomputer ever dep loyed on a U.S. academic campus. The system began accepting early science and engineering research users in May 2019 and became fully operational in October 2019. Frontera is expected to allow researchers to tackle much larger and more complex science and engineering applications than ever before, within and across disciplines as diverse as biology, astronomy, engineering, materials science, and the geosciences. Blue Waters, the NSF -funded leadership -class computing resource deployed at the National Center for Supercomputing Applications at the University of Illinois at Urbana -Champaign (UIUC) , became operational in FY 2013. Although Blue Waters was originally anticipated to complete its operational cycle in December 2019, the National Geospatial -Intelligen ce Agency has provided funding to NSF to maintain the system into FY 2021 to support automated, large -scale generation of digital elevation models. The continued operations of Blue Waters will produce geospatial products that will contribute significantly to the advancement of Earth science and provide critical benefits to Federal agencies needing to access unclassified geospatial data. 30 Current Status The acquisition of Frontera was the result of a year -long competition from FY 2017 to FY 2018. ci-blueprint -v10-508.pdf 30 www.congress.gov/116/crpt/hrpt101/CRPT -116hrpt101.pdf (pg. 97) Directorate for Computer and Information Science and Engineering CISE - 16 2018 meeting, the NSB authorized the Director at her discretion to make an award to TACC for the acquisition of the Frontera system in an amount not to exceed $60.0 million over a period of five years. The resolution also authorized, pending appropriate approval associated with NSF's MREFC policies, an additional amount not to exceed $8.0 million to be made available to TACC in the form of supplemental funding to advance the design of a Phase 2 leadership-class computing facility (LCCF) . At its May 2019 meeting, the NSB authorized the Director at her discretion to make an award to TACC for the O&M of Frontera in an amount not to exceed $60.0 million over a period of five years. It offers the highest scale, throughput, and data analysis capabilities ever deployed on a U.S. university campus. Through its primary c entral processing unit subsystem, Frontera offer s more than five times greater capacity than Blue Waters. In addition, Frontera's graphics processing unit (GPU) accelerates discoveries in important research areas such as deep learning and molecular dynamics. In July 2019, TACC started the design and pl anning process for a follow -on Phase 2 LCCF , which will enable a 10 times performance improvement over the existing Frontera system . The Phase 2 LCCF will be managed and overseen by the NSF MREFC process. This project is therefore subject to MREFC policies regarding entry and approval into the required design stages as laid out in the NSF Major Facilities Guide .31 The Frontera system is providing science and engineering evaluation to inform the design of the future facility. Science and Engineering Resear ch and Education Activities Enabled by Leadership-Class Computing Leadership -class computing systems enable investigators across the Nation to conduct innovative research that is not otherwise possible due to demanding computing requirements. In FY 2019, N SF issued a D ear Colleague Letter32 inviting supplemental funding requests to active NSF research awards for time on the Frontera and Blue Waters systems to enable scientific and engineering research that would not otherwise be possible without access to a leadership -class computing resource; this effort resulted in 48 awards to research teams across the country. Research topics supported through these awards include: a very large- scale simulation of the entire stellar universe to understand the first billion years of cosmic evolution; a never -before -done simulation of mammalian brain activity at varied behavioral time scales to better understand how the human brain works; a comprehensive climate model study to understand the role of atmospheric rivers in shaping recorded hydroclimate s in the southwest region of North America; detailed calculations of seismic energy propagation to enable better earthquake prediction and its effects on buildings and other civil infra structure; a massive computation effort to produce openly distributed, very high-resolution digital surface models covering a substantial portion of the Earth's land mass ; simulations of the largest and most aggressive types of tornadoes common in the U.S. to enable better severe weather predictio ns; develop ment of a new framework for cosmological simulations of galaxy formation, combinin g machine learning with cosmological codes; and the integration of deep learning methods with biophysics models in the application of understanding how brain cance r develops and progresses. In FY 2020, NSF issued a D ear Colleague Letter 33 describing a new innovative pilot mechanism for the Nation's researchers to request access to Frontera. The pilot mechanism is expected to promote novel leadership -class applicati ons, ensur e appropriate prioritization of cutting -edge science and engineering, and enable maximal utilization of the computing resource. New awards for access to Frontera through this mechanism are anticipated to begin in April 2020. Education and outrea ch activities supported by the program consist of projects targeting students at pre - college, undergraduate, graduate, and post -graduate levels; workshops, conferences, summer schools, and 31 www.nsf.gov/pubs/2019/nsf19068/nsf19068.pdf 32 www.nsf.gov/pubs/2019/nsf19030/nsf19030.jsp 33 www.nsf.gov/pubs/2020/nsf20018/nsf20018.jsp FY 2021 Budget Request to Congress CISE - 17 seminars; and industry partnership activities. To date, NSF -funded leadership -class computing activities have enabled more than 200 education, outreach, and training projects at over 160 institutions, including institutions in the Established Program to Stimulate Competitive Research jurisdictions. Management and Oversig ht The Frontera and Blue Waters projects are overseen by OAC's program directors and BFA's Division of Grants and Agreements staff, who receive strategic advice from the AD Council. Advice from the NSF Office of General Counsel is also sought, as necessary . Planning for the Phase 2 system is coordinated through the Large Facilities Office , as well as the Division of Acquisition and Cooperative Support , and will be reviewed in accordance with NSF's major facilities policies and procedures. The NSB receives updates on any major changes in risk assessments, which are reviewed annually by an external panel. Risks monitored during the operational phase of a project include system security, performance, reliability, usability, project management, and other factor s that could reduce the overall scientific impact. Advanced/Innovative Computing Systems and Services Description NSF funds the acquisition and operation of nationally available Advanced/Innovative Computing Systems and Services that, in aggregate, are forward -looking and technically diverse, and reflect changing and growing use of data -intensive computation in both the research and education processes. At the same time, they are intended to enable discoveries at a computational scale beyond the reach of an individual or regional academic institution. Deployed systems currently serve as a cohesive set of allocable resources within the eXtreme Digital (XD) integrated services infrastructure, which is described in the following section. Awards are generally made as two parts: an acquisition and deployment award, which may be the result of a competitive or a renewal proposal; and a separate award for operations and maint enance following deployment. When an award is made, the awardee institution issues sub -awards to vendors and/or other organizations for acquisitions and services as necessary. Expenditures are contingent on successful completion of deployment milestones. Current Status Four resources (Wrangler, Comet, Bridges, and Jetstream) commenced operations in FY 2015 and FY 2016. In FY 2018, the period of operation for these four systems was extended, as noted below, allowing for increased return on investment and ensuring continuity of operations for the research community. Stampede 2, the largest of the currently active HPC resources within this portfolio, commenced operation in FY 2017. Deployed in FY 2015 at TACC, Wrangler is the most powerful data analysis syst em allocated in XD and provides flexible support for a wide range of scientific domains and will remain operational through December 2020 . Comet also came online in FY 2015 at the University of California, San Diego (UCSD). It supports research interests and priorities requiring large, high-throughput workloads, as well as massive amounts of computation but at moderate scale. Comet was augmented with GPUs in FY 2018 and is planned to remain operational through March 2021. Bridges came online in FY 2016 at the Pittsburgh Supercomputing Center on the campus of Carnegie Mellon University (CMU). Bridges provides an innovative HPC and data analytics system integrating advanced memory technologies to empower new communities. It brings desktop convenience to HPC, potentially enabling new communities to access advanced computing resources. Bridges was augmented Directorate for Computer and Information Science and Engineering CISE - 18 with GPU nodes in FY 2018 and will remain operational through November 2020. Jetstream also came online in FY 2016 at Indiana University. Jetstream is a cl oud-based platform that incorporates the elements of commercial cloud computing resources with important scientific applications. Jetstream's system operation was augmented in FY 2017 to provide additional focused staff expertise to accelerate effective researcher utilizations of the programmable CI/virtual machine -enabled architecture. The system will continue operations through November 2020. In FY 2016, NSF awarded Stampede 2: The Next Generation of Petascale Computing for Science and Engineering to TAC C following a rigorous merit review, enabling the acquisition and deployment of Stampede 2 as a successor resource to the highly successful Stampede system. Stampede operated from 2013 through 2017 and was considered the \"backbone\" for the XD environment, annually supporting more than 5,000 researchers and more than 1,000 computationally-intensive projects across the Nation. Stampede 2 similarly serves as the primary national resource for thousands of academic researchers, complements other national advance d computing systems and services, and provides capabilities beyond the reach of individual campuses and regional resources. Stampede 2 was fully deployed as a production resource by the end of 2018 and is expected to continue operations through November 2022. As noted above, Wrangler, Comet, Bridges, and Jetstream are all scheduled to ramp down operations during the FY 2020 to FY 2021 timeframe. During this period, Stampede 2 will continue full operations and the new leadership -class computing system, Fron tera, will ramp up to full operations, ensuring continued support for the science and engineering research community. Moving forward, NSF envisions that investments in advanced/innovative computing systems and services will foster an integrated CI ecosystem that addresses the growing scale and diversity of the science and engineering community, the changing nature of science and engineering research requirements, and the rapidly evolving technology and services landscape, with the overarching goal of suppor ting the full range of computational - and data -intensive research across all science and engineering domains. To further this goal, NSF issued a solicitation for advanced computing systems and services in FY 2019 with anticipated awards spanning FY 2019 to FY 2024. 34 This solicitation calls for investments in two categories: Category I, Capacity Systems: production computational resources maximizing the capacity provided to support the broad range of computation and data analytics needs in science and engineering research. Category II, Innovative Prototypes/Testbeds: innovative forward-looking capabilities deploying novel technologies, architectures, usage modes, etc., and exploring new target applications, methods, and paradigms for science and engineering discoveries. The solicitation allow ed for two competitions spanning FY 2019 and FY 2020. In the first competition , three awards were made: two in Category I, to the Pittsburgh Supercomputing Center at CMU and to the San Diego Supercomputer Center at UCSD; and one in Category II to the State University of New York at Stony Brook. The second competition is currently underway. Science and Engineering Research and Education Activities Enabled by Advanced/Innovative Computing Systems and Services The ecosystem of advanced/innovative computing systems and services is enabling new, world-leading, and transformative advances across the breadth of science and engineering research, in the integration of research and education, and in broadening participation in science and engineering by underrepresented groups. It is enabling new collaborations across public and private sectors to advance American security and economic competitiveness. These advances are made possible by providing researchers and educators with access to world -leading computational systems and services beyond what is typically available on most campuses. Providing access includes providing the necessary expertise, interfaces, consulting support, and training necessary to facilitate use of the systems and services. This activity is central to America 34 www.nsf.gov/pubs/2019/nsf19534/nsf19534.htm FY 2021 Budget Request to Congress CISE - 19 achieving the full potential of complementary investments by NSF, other federal agencies, and academic institutions in computing infrastructure. Management and Oversight OAC's program directors provide di rect oversight during both the acquisition, and O&M awards. Formal reporting consists of quarterly and annual reports, which are reviewed by the program directors. Awards for advanced/innovative computing system and services are managed under cooperative agreements that include the management structures, milestones, spending authorization levels, and review schedules. Each awardee is responsible for the satisfactory completion of milestones prior to NSF authorization of spending. Progress is assessed with the aid of annual external reviews. In addition, each project is required to have a project management plan. Any activity of this nature, and at this scale, comes with a certain element of risk. The review process, conducted prior to award, analyzes the risks as presented in the proposal and identifies any additional risks that should be considered. During the award process, risks are identified and analyzed, and a mitigation plan is created and followed. One of the activities of the periodic NSF external reviews, conducted by an external panel of experts, is to revisit and reassess the risk situation and make recommendations as deemed necessary. In the case of projects that involve an acquisition, project risks are generally substantially reduced subsequent to deployment. Thus, the pacing of the acquisitions and deployments for such projects provides balance in the overall risk portfolio for the program. Milestone -driven reviews occur during the acquisition award, typically with an external review prior to deployment. Annual reviews, conducted by an external panel of expert reviewers and managed by OAC program directors, are performed during the operational phase of each project. Coordination and Support Services Description NSF's investments in coordination and support services, as exemplified by the XD integrated services infrastructure, add value to the NSF advanced/innovative computing systems and services by c oordinating allocations and access to the systems and services, providing advanced assistance to the user community, and broadening participation. The XD program's shared services model for coherently and efficiently providing researchers with both access and expertise to diverse, dynamic, and distributed resources is a cornerstone of the American advanced computing ecosystem. Enabling the connection between individual campuses and national resources is an essential aspect of the advanced computing ecosystem. XD enables and supports leading -edge scientific discovery and promotes science and technology education. The program encourages innovation in the design and implementation of an effective, efficient, increasingly virtualized approach to the provision of high -end digital services, while ensuring that the infrastructure continues to deliver high- quality access for the many researchers and educators who use it in their work. XD shared services consist of several interrelated parts: allocation of resources to computational and data research projects; advanced user assistance; training, education, and outreach; architecture and operation of an integrated digital services infrastructure; metrics services; and overall coordination. These elements are designed and implemented in a way that is clearly tied to the requirements of the science and engineering research community, using a flexible methodology that permits the architecture to evolve in response to changing community needs and that presents individual users with a common environment regardless of where the resources or researchers are located. Directorate for Computer and Information Science and Engineering CISE - 20 Current Status Two awards are currently active within the XD program: XD Metrics Service (XMS) and the eXtreme Science and Engineering Discovery Environment (XSE DE). The XMS award was made in FY 2015 to The State University of New York at Buffalo. This award provides metrics services allowing measurement of key operational data for both resources and services. All other services are provided by XSEDE. The XSEDE award to UIUC was renewed in September 2016, continuing the prior XSEDE award for another five-year period. The award will conclude at the end of August 2021, and in anticipation of that date, NSF has initiated engagements with the community about the struct ure and composition of future coordination efforts. Within the current XSEDE project, there are 18 partners engaged via subawards to the University of Tennessee at Knoxville (National Institute for Computational Sciences), CMU and University of Pittsburgh (Pittsburgh Supercomputing Center), UT Austin (TACC), UCSD (San Diego Supercomputing Center), University of Chicago, Indiana University, Purdue University, Shodor Education Foundation, Ohio Supercomputer Center, Southeastern Universities Research Associat ion, Cornell University, National Center for Atmospheric Research, Georgia Institute of Technology, Oklahoma State University, University of Georgia, Oklahoma University, University of Southern California, and University of Arkansas. The mid -project external site review of the XMS project took place in June 2018 and continued operations were authorized based on the successful outcome of that review. XSEDE has annual external reviews at NSF. The first external review of the renewed XSEDE project took place in June 2017; subsequent external milestone reviews have taken place in January and June, with the most recent review having occurred in June 2019. On the basis of these successful reviews, funds were authorized for continued operations. NSF has outlined its plans for national CI coordination services moving forward in a blueprint document released in Q1 of FY 2020 . 35 Science and Engineering Research and Education Activities Enabled by Coordination and Support Services Coordination and support services, as exemplified by XD, enable transformative advances in science and engineering research, in the integration of research and education, and in broadening the participation of underrepresented groups in science and engineering. These advances are accomplish ed by providing researchers and educators with coherent and highly usable access to extreme- scale digital resources beyond those typically available on most campuses, together with the interfaces, consulting, advanced user support, and training necessary t o facilitate their use. XD coordinates access to advanced/innovative computing systems and services and enables researchers to efficiently manipulate, analyze, visualize, and share extremely large amounts of distributed digital information from simulations, sensors, and experiments. The XSEDE project delivers tools and services that not only link users to national facilities, but also enable scientific collaborations of geographically distributed teams. In doing so, it facilitates dynamic access to digital resources and experimental testbeds within and across university campuses, as well as government laboratories. XSEDE includes outreach and training critical to reducing barriers to the use of advanced digital systems by the research and educati on communities, thereby promoting enhanced productivity. The XMS project develops analysis tools and collects operational data from XSEDE services and the advanced computing/innovative systems and services. The immediate users of these methods and tools are the providers of NSF -supported advanced computing systems and services. However, both tools and data are publicly available and used by other projects such as Blue Waters, Frontera, and individual universities. 35 www.nsf.gov/cise/oac/vision/blueprint -2019/nsf-aci -blueprint -services.pdf FY 2021 Budget Request to Congress - 21 Management and Oversight OAC's program di rectors oversee the XD projects. XSEDE has an external advisory board, a user board, and a service provider forum to ensure that all stakeholders can provide project input. OAC oversight of the XSEDE project includes participation in weekly teleconferences with senior XSEDE personnel and in quarterly project -wide staff meetings. Formal reporting consists of quarterly and annual reports, which are reviewed by the program directors. Each XD award is managed under a cooperative agreement that includes requirements for a specific management structure, milestones, reporting of spending levels over time, and a review schedule. Each awardee is responsible for the satisfactory completion of milestones prior to NSF authorization of spending. In addition, each projec t is required to have a detailed management plan in place. While XD is operational in nature, the virtual organizations of the XSEDE project and the services of all XD projects are innovative and thus bear inherent risks. The projects maintain risk registers that are reviewed periodically by external panels and by the cognizant program directors. Annual reviews for XSEDE and mid -project reviews for XMS are conducted by external panels of expert reviewers and managed by OAC program directors.

Each year, the directorate collects evidence through workshops, surveys and other means to help identify emerging areas, learn about program results, and get other input from the community. ENG als o periodically conducts reviews and evaluations to understand program effectiveness. Together, these measures help ENG make programs more strategic and impactful. Evidence and Surveys In March 2019, IIP began administering a Baseline Monitoring Survey to companies that received a SBIR/STTR Phase I award after May 2018. The survey results will be used to create a performance baseline for recent SBIR/STTR award ees. The survey data allows IIP to benchmark across Phase I Directorate for Engineering ENG - 6 companies, understand how successful sm all businesses differ, and identify potential failure modes to inform future initiatives supporting current and future small businesses. As of January 2020, more than 450 Phase I awardees have completed the survey. IIP will continue administering the survey to understand the impact s of the programs on these companies over time . Starting in March 2019, IIP made a significant change to the SBIR/STTR proposal submission process by requiring that small businesses or entrepreneurs submit a three-page Project Pitch prior to submitting a ful+l proposal. Pitch submitters learn within three weeks if their idea aligns with program objectives and receive program guidance. The new process offers real -time assistance to startups, advances the funding process, and accele rates the development of new ventures. Between March 2019 and January 2020, more than 4,500 small businesses or entrepreneurs completed the Project Pitch process. Applicants were surveyed to inform ongoing refinements of the Project Pitch process as NSF co ntinues to provide critical support to the technology small business and startup communities. Initial analysis indicates that most Pitch submitters found the process easy. Additionally, most SBIR/STTR applicants found the feedback provided by NSF to be hel pful and were satisfied with the wait time to get feedback. Workshops and Reports In March 2019, an ECCS -supported workshop on \"Reconfigurable Sensor Systems Integrated with Artificial Intelligence and Data Harnessing to Enable Personalized Medicine\" was held. The focus of the workshop was to determine future strategies for advancing th e fundamental understanding and engineering of reconfigurable sensor systems by integrating hardware with data harnessing, real -time learning, and artificial intelligence capabilities. The workshop report ,2 published in fall 2019, will inform ECCS ' plans and priorities in Reconfigurable Sensor Systems enabling Personalized Medicine. In March 2019, NSF's Disrupting Illicit Supply Networks program, which began in FY 2018, had two follow -up activities : (1) NSF (ENG, CISE, and SBE), led by CMMI, issued a dear colleague letter3 for research proposals with six new awards funded in FY 2019 ; (2) a new workshop4 brought together operations researchers, computer scientists, social scientists, business researchers, geographers, social service agency representatives, and federal agencies to increase understanding of both the nature, and the challenges to disruption, of illicit supply chains. NSF is currently assessing input from the workshops, PIs, other federal agencies, and NGOs for broader interagency research oppo rtunities. In May 2019, an ECCS -funded workshop on the interface between machine learning ( ML) and dynamics and control took place at MIT .5 While ML has had tremendous impact in areas such as computer vision and language translation, over the next decade the explosion of real -time data (from devices that sense and control the physical world) requires a convergence of research areas such as ML , model -based dynamical systems, and control and decision theory. This activity will impact planned funding activities in priority areas such as artificial intelligence and the HDR Big Idea. In June 2019, NSF submitted its first report6 to Congress about the I -Corps program. The report was developed in response to the American Innovation and Competitiveness Act (AICA) (P.L. 114 -329) , which require s NSF to develop program metrics and deliver a report to Congress every two years. In July 2019, ENG and the American S ociety for Engineering Education ( ASEE) held a Visioning Summit to engage various engineering communities in determining mechanisms through which the fundamental engineering research community's priorities may be identified. A ttendees learned about a variety of mechanisms currently used by industry and academia to identify important priorities and trends; collecting this information in one place will be useful for the engineering community and help develop an evidence base for decision making. In late 2019, ASEE published a summit report.7 20 21 Budget Request to Congress ENG - 7 At the end of FY 2019, CBET, together with the Department of Energy (DOE) Offices of Fossil Energy and Science and the DOE Office of Energy Efficiency and Renewable Energy, co -funded a consensus study by the National Academies of Sciences, Engineering, and Medicine. The three-year study will survey the current state of the chemical engineering discipline and its contributions to society as well as articulate a vision for the future of the field. The main objective of the study is to outline a vision and str ategy for chemical engineering research, innovation, and education over the next thirty years. In October 2019, an ECCS -funded workshop on security in Radio Frequency (RF)/analog microelectronics and electromagnetics 8 was held to explore the needs and challenges involved in ensuring security in future analog hardware that operates over the range from direct current (DC) to terahertz (THz) frequencies. The workshop helped identify areas for future investment in ECCS core programs and special solicitations. Workshop outcomes should impact planned funding activities in semiconductor microelectronics, advanced wireless, machine-learning enhanced engineered systems, manufacturing, and other priority areas, as well as HDR Big Idea-supported programs . In FY 2020, IIP expects to complete the migration of the data collection and management process for the Industry- University Cooperative Research Center (IUCRC) program ; the transition was delayed due to the government shutdown. One goal of this migration is to build an in -house data ecosystem for the IUCRC program that entails collecting, organizing, and managing internal and external data, including annual survey data. The combination of data sources will provide a holistic view of the program and enable customized a nalyses on a center level. Evaluations and Reviews In FY 2016 , the NSF 's Evaluation and Assessment Capability office initiated a study of the I -Corps Teams program to assess its impact s on teams that completed the entrepreneurial training and on academic culture. The analysis used quantitative data from surveys and case studies developed from in-depth interviews and site visits. Completed in FY 2019, the evaluation advised IIP to modify the longitudinal survey questions to better capture all potential commercialization outcome metrics . In FY 2019, the National Nanotechnology Coordinated Infrastructure (NNCI) program went through a review of its first five years. Results provided ECCS wit h evidence -based data to inform future decisions regarding NNCI sites and other investments . In addition, the NNCI facility has a metrics and assessment committee with a defined common set of site and network metrics based on usage data. In FY 2019, the National Center for Science and Engineering Statistics (NCSES) began efforts to advance the use of its Data for Evidence-based Research and Evaluation. As part of this effort, the ENG Engineering Research Center ( ERC) program will clarify its data collection requirements to make full use of NCSES data. L inkage of the dataset will allow longitudinal evaluation of the ERC program impact s on student participants. Committees of Visitors (COV) 9 In FY 2019, COVs reviewed CBET and CMMI for the p eriod of FY 2015 through FY 2018.

The core areas of MPS science (astronomical sciences, chemistry, materials research, mathematical sciences, and physics) continue to advance and transform knowledge and support the development of the next gene ration of scientists. S cience funded by MPS spans an enormous range: from the smallest objects and shortest timescales ever studied to distances and timescales that are the size and age of the universe. MPS continue s to foster and support interdisciplinary scientific programs that span in scope and complexity, ranging from individual investigator awards to large, multi -user facilities. Individual investigators and small teams receive most awards, but centers, institutes, and facilities are all integral to MPS -funded research. This convergence of disciplines and various ways to organize researchers allows MPS to invest in compelling basic science that will underpin and enable advances in the technologies of the future and helping to support a strong U .S. econ omy for decades to come. Through its Centers and Institutes programs, MPS will continue to support leading- edge science and the development of the next generation of scientists engaged in research covering fundamental basic science through translational science . The MPS Centers and Institutes span a broad range, from addressing challenges in fundamental mathematics to the development of new materials. Research tools and i nfrastructure are key priorities that MPS will continue fundi ng. Mid-scale research infrastructure in astronomical sciences, chemistry, materials research, and physics continue to be critical to the advanc ement of these disciplines. Large scale research infrastructure is also critical and provides opportunities for partnerships with international groups, other federal agencies, and private foundations , as is evidenced by facilities such as the Atacama Large Millimeter/submillimeter Array (ALMA), the Gemini Observatory, and the Large Hadron Collider (LHC). Since t he major scientific breakthrough of the first direct detection of gravitational waves , by the Laser Interferometer Gravitational Wave Observatory (LIGO) in 2015, the facility reports event alerts on a regular basis. I n 2017, LIGO detected for the first time a neutron star -neutron star merger, initiating the era of multi- messenger astrophysics research. With recent improvements in the instrumentation, detection of gravitational waves has become routine, with 2 5 candidate detections in the fi rst four months of the observing run that began in April 2019. The Event Horizon Telescope (EHT )\u2014a planet -scale array of eight ground- based radio telescopes forged through interna tional collaboration \u2014announced the successful capture of the first direct visual evidence of a supermassive black hole and its shadow on April 10, 2019. More than $28.0 million in direct funding, Directorate for Mathematical and Physical Sciences MPS - 2 provided to EHT researchers from NSF over two decades , was a major factor in achieving this accomplishment . Scientists at the National High Magnetic Field Laboratory made a pivotal discovery in superconducting response s in materials \u2014\"reentrant Lazarus superconductivity\" at world record ultra -high magnetic fields\u2014 that promises to finally reveal the mysteries of how superconductivity works. The Vera C. Rubin Observatory, formerly known as the Large Synoptic Survey Telescope , is an ongoing construction project and the High Luminosity Upgrade to LHC is expected to receive construction funding beginning in FY 2020. For more details about these construction projects, see the MREFC chapter. NSF's Daniel K. Inouye Solar Telescope will transition from construction to opera tions in FY 2020, becoming the world's most powerful solar observatory. MPS' FY 2021 Request builds on past efforts and aligns with NSF 's priorities articulated for FY 202 1. There are exciting new opportunities emerging, research efforts that are maturing, and established programs and activities that continue to meet important goals and support science that will transform the Nation's future. MPS investments are influenced by the following key priorities: ( a) sustaining core research programs , (b) supporting the highest priority facilities, ( c) supporting early- career investigators, (d) providing funding for targeted basic research in NSF -wide investments including the NSF Big Ideas , and (e) advancing support for industries of the f uture, such as quantum information science (QIS) , advanced manufacturing, the spectrum innovation initiative , and artificial intelligence (AI). In partnership with other research directorates and offices, MPS will continue to provide support for the following research Bi g Ideas: QL, WoU, HDR, and URoL. These are the outcome of numerous community workshops and reports, as synthesized by NSF into robust and far -reaching programs. MPS is the steward of funds designated for NSF 's Big Idea s QL and WoU . These convergent activit ies will enable pursuit of fundamental research in quantum -enabled sciences and technologies and in multi -messenger astrophysics. By exploiting quantum phenomena such as superposition, entanglement, and squeezing, QL activities will develop the foundations for and enable quantum computing, quantum sensors, quantum communications, quantum simulators, and other inherently quantum technologies. In addition, these activities will contribute to the development of the Nation's quantum -ready workforce. WoU activit ies will bring together fundamental research in electromagnetic waves, high -energy particles, and gravitational waves; advance the study of the universe; and grow the Nation's multi- messenger astrophysics, engineering, and data science workforce. While fin ancial stewardship for these investments will be the responsibility of MPS, these convergent activities will be overseen and managed collaboratively by QL and WoU leadership and management teams. MPS is also the steward of funds designated for two administration priority areas, QIS and the S pectrum I nnovation I nitiative . For more information about the QL, WoU and QIS, see the related narratives in the NSF -Wide Investments chapter. MPS provides approximately 49 percent of the federal funding for bas ic research at academic institutions in the mathematical and physical sciences.

EAC collaborates with internal and external partners to conduct its work. Internally, EAC works with all NSF organizational units through a steering committee that provides advice and a working group that includ es NSF staff engaged with EAC projects. E xternally, EAC collaborates with partners in strategic initiatives; examples include (1) an ongoing collaboration with the National Institutes of Health on using machine learning to generate evidence, and (2) participation with OMB and an interagency council to develop guidance for program evaluation in fulfillment of the Foundations for Evidence -Based Policymaking Act of 2018 (Evidence Act) section 101(e). In FY 2021, EAC will continue to prioritize its response to OMB guidance on the implement ation of the Evidence Act. This will include participation in meetings and councils (such as the Evaluation Officers Council) and prepar ation of deliverables specified in OMB 's guidance, including NSF 's evaluation policy, interim agency -wide learning agenda, and annual evaluation plan. Studies conducted to suppor t this work include an agency -wide capacity assessment and several evaluations listed under \"External Program Evaluations and Studies.\" FY 20 21 Budget Request to Congress IA - 3 Facility Operation Transition Facility Operation Transition reflects NSF's strategic commitment to a smooth transition from MREFC to O&M funding of new major facilities, as well as achievement of a balanced portfolio between facilities and investigator research, both of which were emphasized in the NSB's Congressionally requested 2019 report entitled \"Study of Operations a nd Maintenance Costs for NSF Facilities\" (NSB - 2018 -17). 1 The Facility Operation Transition funding will be used to (1) partially support initial O&M of new facilities so that the full O&M costs can be gradually absorbed into the managing division or directorate, and (2) partially support divestment of lower -priority facilities, the full cost of which may significantly impact individual division or directorate funding. Graduate Research Fellowship Program GRFP supports training tomorrow's leaders in the re search community and contributes to building a diverse, highly skilled U.S. workforce. Funding for GRFP is split equally between IA and EHR. NSF's FY 2021 GRFP funding will support 1,600 new fellows. The program will continue to align awards with Administration priorities, including artificial intelligence, quantum information science, and other areas within the Administration's Industries of the Future initiative . Information on recent evaluations of GRFP may be found in the Graduate STEM Education narrative in the NSF -Wide Investments chapter. Growing Convergence Research GCR, as an \"enabling\" Idea within NSF's Big Ideas, supports basic research that uses novel, transdisciplinary approaches to solve complex problems. The unifying characteristics of these undertakings are that: (1) they have the potential to make a significant impact, either on fundamental understanding in S&E or on the Nation's ability to meet pressing societal challenges, or both; and (2) they require the integration of knowledge, tools, and ways of thinking from multiple disciplines. GCR also aims to grow the next generation of convergence researchers. In FY 2021, GCR investments will support six to eight new exploratory research col laborations and the continuation of six to eight projects begun in FY 2019. For more information about GCR, see the narrative in the NSF -Wide Investments chapter.

In general, about 14 percent of the EPSCoR portfolio is available to support new research grants. The remaining 86 percent supports gr ants made in prior years. EPSCoR uses three strategic investment tools: Research Infrastructure Improvement (RII) awards, Co - Funding, and Outreach/Workshops. Research Infrastructure Improvement (RII) RII investments support development of physical, human, and cyber -based research infrastructure in EPSCoR jurisdictions, with an emphasis on collaborations among academic researchers, the private sector, and state and local governments, to effect sustainable improvements in research infrastructure. RII projec ts are designed to improve the research competitiveness of jurisdictions by strengthening their academic research infrastructure in areas of S&E supported by NSF that are critical to the jurisdiction's science and technology initiatives. RII projects increase the participation of underrepresented groups in STEM, enable broader regional and topical collaborations among jurisdictions, and facilitate the enhancement of discovery, learning, and economic development in EPSCoR jurisdictions. EPSCoR facilitates th e engagement of its jurisdictions in S&E priority areas such as NSF's Big Ideas. Co-Funding EPSCoR co -funding - with NSF directorates and offices - focuses on meritorious proposals from individual investigators, groups, and centers in EPSCoR jurisdictions that are submitted to the Foundation's research and education programs, including crosscutting initiatives. These proposals undergo merit review in the program to which they were submitted and are recommended for award, but cannot be funded without the combined, leveraged support of EPSCoR. In FY 2021, no less than $20.0 million will be invested in Mid -scale RI -1 projects in EPSCoR jurisdictions. For more information about the Mid -scale Research Infrastructure Big Idea , see the narrative in the NSF -Wide Investments chapter. Integrative Activities IA - 8 Outreach and Workshops The Outreach component of EPSCoR solicits requests for workshops, conferences, and other community-based activities. These are designed to explore opportunities in emerging areas of S&E and to share best practices in strategic planning, diversity, communication, and other capacity -building areas of importance in EPSCoR jurisdictions. EPSCoR also supports outreach travel that enables NSF staff from all directorates and offices to directly engage and inform the EPSCoR research community about NSF opportunities, priorities, programs, and policies. Strategic Partnership and Evaluation Activities In FY 2021, NSF EPSCoR will continue to implement a cohesive academic research competitiveness evaluation framework, which will be completed in May 2020. This framework will enable the study of the processes and outcomes that contribute to academic researc h competitiveness. EPSCoR will continue to identify and collect high-quality data from jurisdictions and will work with jurisdictions to use the framework to identify opportunities for increasing their competitiveness in NSF research programs and for other federal and private S&E funding. EPSCoR will also use the evidence gained from this framework to guide continuous improvement in its overall program.

CA makes timely investments that (1) initiate new capabilities to accelerate convergence research in areas of national importance, and (2) build capacity in multi -stakeholder convergence teams to address these critical challen ges. Convergence research is a means of solving complex research problems. The unifying characteristics of these problems are that: (1) they have the potential to make a significant impact, either on fundamental understanding in S&E or on the Nation's ability to meet pressing societal challenges, or both; and (2) they require the integration of knowledge, tools, and ways of thinking from multiple disciplines. Focusing on use-inspired, convergence research, with directed deliverables and using an approach that rewards innovation, risk-taking, and transition to use, CA has customized various models and techniques on acceleration and innovation activities that have proven successful in similar environments. Convergence Accelerator Research In FY 2021, CA will invest in HDR and FW-HTF related research tracks and new research tracks informed by community input through responses to a Request for Information and other external stakeholder input. The CA will support use -inspired research while encouraging rapid advances through partnerships that include, or will include, multiple stakeholders (e.g., industry, academic, not-for-profits, government entities). CA research tracks comprise two phases of evolving technical topics within the CA. Phase 1: Each CA pro ject begin s with a nine -month planning effort , funded at up to $1 million, for further development of the initial proposal, identifying new team members, participating in an innovation curriculum, and developing initial prototypes. The innovation curriculum consists of training in human-centered design, team science activities, inter -team communications, and presentation coaching , all of which are essential components of the operations of the Accelerator. The training will help the teams better prepare for success in the next phase of support, focused on building prototypes, developing experimental designs, and other deliverables, as appropriate. At the end of Phase 1, teams will participate in a pitch competition along with a proposal evaluation. Phase 2: Each Phase 1 team selected to proceed to Phase 2 will be provided additional support of up to $5.0 million for 24 months. Teams are expected to provide specific research deliverables by the end of Phase 2. In each of FY 2020 and FY 2021, a n estimated 3 0 Phase 1 awards will be made in new CA tracks. Two or three n ew FY 2020 tracks will be selected in February 2020 based on the responses to the Request for Integrative Activities IA - 10 Information6 and community workshops. Two or three n ew FY 2021 CA research tracks will be selected no later than December 2020. The new FY 2021 tracks will be b ased on analysis of community-based inputs and assessment of the progress of the existing tracks and will take into account Administration R&D priorities such as IotF. In addition, a n estimated 10 Phase 2 awards will be made in FY 202 0 and 10 Phase 2 awards in FY 2021. CA Planning and Development Investments in CA Planning and Development will enable opportunities in emerging S&E areas best suited for CA consideration, through workshops, conferences, and other community-based activities. This component also supports the sharing of best practices in innovation, diversity, team building, and communication. 6 www.nsf.gov/pubs/2019/nsf19065/nsf19065.jsp?WT.mc_id=USNSF_179 USARC - 1 UNITED STATES ARCTIC RESEARCH COMMISSION (USARC) / 2019 Actual About USARC USARC was created by the Arctic Research and Policy Act of 1984, (as amended, P. L. 101 -609), to establish the national policy, priorities, and goals necessary to construct a federal program plan for basic and applied Arctic scientific research.

EHR recognizes the need to invest in foundational and future -oriented STEM educational research , using the results of research to inform STEM programs and practices, to ensure the prosperity of the nation through a well -educated STEM workforce. Like all research, results might be applied more immediately or well into the future. As such, i n FY 2021, EHR will deepen efforts to build capacity for STEM education research and identify and tackle the challenges in STEM education needed to create the workforce for the Industries of the Future (IotF). Thus, EHR's research portfolio will address foundational (perennial) issues in STEM education by exploring persistent questions about the learning and teaching of STEM content , as well as future -oriented a reas that result from changes in technology, the nation's demography, the economy, and new directions in STEM . These areas include how and what to teach students so that they are prepared to engage with Artificial Intelligence, Quantum Information Science, and Computing, and how to do so in a manner that reduces demographic disparities. EHR's partnership with Boeing is one model for leveraging public -private partnerships to develop the STEM workforce for IotF. In FY 2020, EHR and Boeing focused on how to de velop the workforce in model -based engineering, mechatronics, and data science/sensor analytics through the use of flexible, personalized learning systems. In FY 2021, EHR will continue to study the implementation of personalized learning systems in developing the STEM workforce for IotF. EHR allocations across divisions are designed to accomplish the collective work of the directorate, best described by three underlying themes: STEM learning and learning environments, broadening participation and institu tional capacity, and STEM professional workforce development. These themes dovetail with the three aspirational goals of the F ederal government's 5- year strategic plan , Charting a Course for Success: America's Strategy for STEM Education, 1 which are: (1) Build Strong Foundations for STEM Literacy; (2) Increase Diversity, Equity, and Inclusion in STEM, and (3) Prepare the STEM Workforce for the Future. EHR's programs all contribute to these strategic goals. In addition, EHR supports the impl ementation of the 5- year strategic plan by co -chairing the NSTC Subcommittee on Federal Coordination in STEM 1 NSTC (2018). Charting a Course for Success: America's Strategy for STEM Education. www.whitehouse.gov/wp - content/uploads/2018/12/STEM -Education -Strategic-Plan -2018.pdf Directorate for Education and Human Resources EHR - 2 Education (FC -STEM) and co -leading several FC -STEM Interagency Working Groups. Progress in STEM depends on discoverers\u2014innovators and future leade rs in the nation's science and engineering (S&E) enterprise in both the public and private sectors. These discoverers , including those from K -12 and informal learning environments, are critical members of the future STEM and STEM -related workforce. Through its scholarship, fellowship, and traineeship programs, EHR supports the development of discoverers at the undergraduate and graduate levels. EHR programs support the STEM -specific workforce, including a data -skilled workforce and the broader workforce tha t rely on STEM skills, thus addressing the Nation's critical need for a diverse, highly skilled technical workforce. The progress of S&E also depends on a public that can take full advantage of STEM -related employment opportunities, and that values and participates in STEM , both formally and informally. Importantly, the opportunities made possible by federal investments in STEM must be provided effectively to\u2014 and draw from \u2014the full and diverse talent pool of the Nation. To this end, EHR continues to support the Historically Black Colleges and Universities Undergraduate Program (HBCU -UP), the Improving Undergraduate STEM Education (IUSE): Hispanic Service Institutions (HSI) Program, and the Tribal Colleges and Universities Program (TCUP) to facilitate the a dvancement of early career STEM professionals at M inority Serving I nstitution s (MSIs) and to enhance the academic experience of students studying STEM at MSIs. As a natural extension of EHR's experience in broadening participation, EHR serves as the stewa rd for NSF INCLUDES, one of NSF's Big Ideas. EHR continues to make advances in knowledge generation and dissemination through NSF INCLUDES to understand what interventions work and under what conditions to broaden participation in STEM. For more information about NSF INCLUDES, see the narrative in the NSF-Wide Investments chapter. EHR supports NSF and Administration priorities through participation in Foundation- wide activities. Through existing programs, EHR invests in NSF's Big Ideas HDR, FW -HTF, and NNA. By incorporating the Big Ideas into NRT's priority themes, EHR invests in the development of researchers with the necessary skills to conduct convergence research. In FY 2021, EHR continues to support SaTC, and NITRD (education and workforce), all of w hich provide opportunities for research on the intersection of artificial intelligence and education. EHR continues its strong emphasis on evidence -based decision making and its commitment to generating robust evidence to inform the development, management, and assessment of its programs and portfolios of investment. A multi- year learning agenda (evidence -building plan) for EHR's STEM human capital development programs will inform and guide future actions. EHR experts in evaluation will continue to collabo rate with staff in NSF's Evaluation and Assessment Capability in developing NSF -wide learning agendas and with other federal agencies to share best practices, work toward the use of common metrics and instruments, strengthen evidence- building capacity for decision -making, and accomplish the transparency and accountability objectives set out in the federal five -year strategy for STEM education.

FY 20 21 Budget Request Congress EHR - 15 H-1B NONIMMIGRANT EstimateFY 2021 RequestFY 2021 Request Change Over FY 2020 Estimate Beginning in FY 1999, Title IV of the American Competitiveness and Workforce Improvement Act (ACWIA) of 1998 (P.L. 105- 277) established an H -1B Nonimmigrant Petitioner Account in the general fund of the U.S. Treasury for fees collected for each petition for alien nonimmigrant status. That law required that a prescribed pe rcentage of funds in the account be made available to NSF for scholarships to low-income STEM students; grants for mathematics, engineering, or science enrichment courses; and systemic reform activities. In FY 2005, Public Law 108 -447 reauthorized H -1B fun ding. NSF was provided with 40 percent of the total H -1B receipts collected. Thirty percent of H -1B receipts (75 percent of the receipts that NSF receives) are to be used for a low -income scholarship program, Scholarships in Science, Technology, Engineering, and Mathematics (S -STEM). Ten percent of receipts (25 percent of the receipts that NSF receives) are designated for support of private -public partnerships in K -12 education through Innovative Technology Experiences for Students and Teachers (ITEST). The FY 2021 Request includes a legislative proposal to double the ACWIA fee for the H -1B visa program (to $3,000 per worker for large employers and $1,500 for small employers) to prepare American workers for jobs that are currently being filled by foreign wo rkers, especially in STEM fields. Under the proposal, NSF's allocation for the ITEST program (10 percent) would remain the same, while its allocation for S-STEM would decrease from 30 percent to 15 percent, a level that would maintain absolute funding leve ls under current estimates. Scholarships in Science, Technology, Engineering, and Mathematics (S -STEM) The S- STEM program began in 1999 under P.L. 105- 277. Originally, the program was named Computer Science, Engineering, and Mathematics Scholarships (CSE MS) and supported grants for scholarships to academically talented , low -income students with demonstrated financial need pursuing associate, baccalaureate, or graduate degrees in computer science, computer technology, engineering, engineering technology, or mathematics. Grantee institutions awarded scholarships of up to $2,500 per year for two years to eligible students. The CSEMS activity continued under the American Competitiveness in the 21 st Century Act (P.L. 106- 313) with a prescribed percentage of H -1B receipts (22 percent) which totaled approximately 59.5 percent of the total H -1B funding for NSF. P.L. 106- 313 also amended P.L. 105- 277 by increasing the maximum scholarship duration to four years and the annual stipend to $3,125. Under the Consolidated Appropriations Act, 2005 (P.L. 108- 447), the prescribed percentage of H -1B receipts available for the low -income scholarship program was increased to 30 percent (approximately 75 percent of the total H -1B funding for NSF). E ligibility for the scholarships was expanded from the original fields of computer science, engineering, and mathematics to include \"other technology and science programs designated by the Director.\" The maximum annual scholarship award amount was raised from $3,125 to $10,000. Language also was added allowing NSF to use up to 50 percent of funds \"for Directorate for Education and Human Resources EHR - 16 undergraduate programs for curriculum development, professional and workforce development, and to advance technological education.\" As a result, the program was renamed in 2006 f rom CSEMS to S- STEM. Low-income Scholarship Program: S -STEM . The S- STEM program provides institutions with funds for student scholarships to encourage and enable academically talented low -income U.S. students with unmet financial need to complete an associ ate, baccalaureate, or graduate degree in fields of science, technology, engineering, or mathematics . Earning these degrees enables the graduates to enter the STEM workforce or STEM graduate school . The program emphasizes the importance of recruiting stude nts to STEM disciplines, mentoring and supporting students through degree completion, and partnering with employers to facilitate student career placement in the STEM workforce. Since its inception, the low -income scholarship program has received more than 7,000 proposals from all types of colleges and universities and has made more than 2,000 awards. In addition to scholarships, S-STEM awards also provide funding for student supp ort activities such as faculty mentoring , academic support, curriculum development, leadership development , and internships. These high-impact activities are known to be effective for recruiting and retaining students in high- technology fields through graduation and into employment. In FY 2020, in addition to the long- standing scholarship support, all S -STEM projects will continue to conduct research on interventions that affect associate or baccalaureate STEM degree attainment by academically talented , low -income U.S. students with unmet financial need. S -STEM projects report much higher retention and graduation rates among their scholarship students than among other STEM majors . As a result, research on S-STEM projects can help the nation understand effective practices to support STEM degree attainment at scale. Approximately 90 awards are anticipated in FY 2020, with a continued emphasis on increasing involvement of community colleges, especially Hispanic -serving institutions. S -STEM acti vities in FY 2020 will leverage efforts in IUSE: EHR, LSAMP, and the IUSE: HSI Program to enhance persistence of students. S -STEM will continue to be a partner in the NSF INCLUDES initiative. S - STEM programming and research also will align with NRT, with t he goal of understanding and enhancing effective learning environments and pathways for students on the continuum from two- year to four -year to master's and doctoral degrees. Private -Public Partnerships in K -12 The American Competitiveness in the 21 st Century Act (P.L. 106- 313) amended P.L. 105- 277 and changed the way petitioner fees were to be expended. P.L. 106- 313 directed the remaining 40.5 percent of the total H-1B funding for NSF (15 percent of H -1B receipts) toward K -12 activities involving private -public partnerships in a range of areas such as materials development, student externships, and mathematics and science teacher professional development. The ITEST program was developed as a partnership activity in K-12 to increase opportunities for stude nts and teachers to learn about, experience, and use information technologies within the context of STEM, including information technology (IT) courses. In FY 2005, P.L. 108-447 reduced the prescribed percentage of H -1B receipts available for private- publi c partnerships in K-12 to 10 percent (approximately 25 percent of the total H -1B funding for NSF). Private -Public Partnerships in K -12: ITEST. The ITEST program invests in K -12 activities that address the ongoing and growing need for STEM professionals and information technology workers in the U.S. and seeks solutions to help ensure the breadth and depth of the U.S. STEM workforce. ITEST funds activities for students and teachers that emphasize mathematics, science, and engineering and computer science careers, and emphasizes the importance of evaluation and research to understand the impact of such activities. The program supports the development, implementation, testing, and scale -up of models, STEM robotics projects, and research studies to improve the ST EM workforce and build a student's capacity to participate in the STEM workforce. The solicitation places emphasis on capturing and establishing a reliable knowledge base about the dispositions toward and knowledge about STEM workforce skills in U.S. stude nts. FY 20 21 Budget Request to Congress EHR - 17 Since its inception, the ITEST program has received more than 3,800 grant proposals and made more than 450 awards (including co -funded projects) that allow K -12 students and teachers to work closely with scientists, engineers, and other STEM professionals on extended research projects that promote awareness of STEM careers and interest in pursuing education pa thways to those careers. Funded projects draw on a wide mix of local resources, including universities, industry, museums, science and technology centers, and school districts to identify the characteristics that attract a wide and diverse range of young people to STEM careers, especially those students historically underrepresented in those careers. ITEST will make approximately 25- FY 2019 (Dollars in Millions) 1 P.L. 108-447 directs that 10 percent of the H-1B Petitioner funds go toward K-12 activities involving private-public partnerships in a range of areas such as materials development, student externships, math and science teacher professional development, etc. Explanation of Carryover Within the H-1B account, $77.47 million was carri ed over into FY 2020.

Mid-scale projects in this table have a total project cost between $20 million and $100 million. Outyear funding numbers for Mid-scale Research Infrastructure are assumed based on maintaining the program at a steady level in the future. 2 Dedicated Construction Oversight in FY 2019 was funded from prior year recoveries. Modern and effective research infrastructure is critical to maintaining U.S. international leadership in science and engineering. The future success of entire fields of research depends upon access to new generations of powerful research tools. Increasingl y, these tools are large and complex and have a significant information technology or cyber -infrastructure component. To be considered for MREFC funding, NSF requires that a major multi- user research facility project represent an exceptional opportunity to enable research and education. The project should be transformative in nature, with the potential to shift the paradigm in scientific understanding. The major facility projects included in this budget request meet these criteria based on NSF and National Science Board review and approval. The mid-scale research infrastructure projects funded through this budget line are evaluated se parately as described in the section below. Major Research Equipment and Facilities Construction MREFC - 4 In FY 2021, NSF requests $ 229.75 million for mid-scale research infrastructure and t o continue construction on three ongoing major research facility projects; the Antarctic Infrastructure Modernization for Science (AIMS), the High Luminosity -Large Hadron Collider (HL -LHC) (form erly the Large Synoptic Survey Telescope -LSST) . For more information on each major facility project see the individual narratives later in this chapter. Major Facilities Since FY 2009, major research facility projects funded through the MREFC account have been subject to NSF's \"no cost overrun\" policy. As a result, NSF processes and procedures must assure the development of realistic and well -supported total project cost estimates such that approved budgets for the award recipient are sufficient to accomplish the scientific objectives. The current policy as published in NSF's Major Facilities Guide (MFG) requires that: (1) the total project cost estimate when exiting the preliminary design phase includes adequat e contingency to cover foreseeable risks manageable by the recipient ; (2) any cost increases not covered by contingency be accommodated first by reductions in scope with any significant scope reductions reviewed by the agency prior to implementation ; and ( 3) if the project is approved to continue and further scope reductions become too detrimental to science, then the first 10 percent of any cost increase must be covered by the sponsoring directorate through R&RA funding. NSF holds the risk to total project cost for events that are beyond the recipient's control . Mid-scale Research Infrastructure The American Innovation and Competitiveness Act (AICA) of 2017 required the agency to develop a strategy for supporting research infrastructure with a total proje ct cost above the upper limit for the Major Research Instrumentation (MRI) program, which is $6.0 million including cost sharing, and below the lower threshold for the MREFC account, which was then at $70.0 million. NSF has evaluated community demand throu gh the issuance of a Request for Information (NSF 18- 013) 1 that resulted in the submission of approximately $10 billion in ideas for projects in the NSF cost range of $20 - $100 million. After evaluating that community input, existing mechanisms, and implementation options, NSF has included a dedicated funding line within the MREFC account for research infrastructu re projects in the $20 - $100 million range .2 This funding line supports upgrades to major facilities as well as stand -alone projects . Projects between $6.0 million and $20.0 million in t otal project c ost are being addressed by individual directorates and by a new NSF -wide program drawing its heritage from the NSF -wide MRI program. The graphic above shows NSF's central ized instrumentation and infrastructure programs. Information presented in this chapter focuses on the MREFC account. All Mid -scale Rese arch Infrastructure (RI) - 1 www.nsf.gov/pubs/2018/nsf18013/nsf18013.jsp 2 The first NSF solicitation for large mid -scale projects covered the $20 million to $70 million range; NSF has extended that range up to $100 million to achieve consistency with AICA definitions regarding the threshold for major facility projects. FY 2021 Budget Request to Congress MREFC - 5 Track 2 investments will be managed as a single portfolio, with individual projects selected from submissions to a dedicated program solicitation and NSF's merit review process. The NSF- established thresholds for Mid- scale RI - Track 2 projects and major facilities construction projects have been updated from initial presentations to provide for greater consistency with AICA definitions . Information on Mid- scale R I programs (Tracks 1 and 2) , as part of the Mid -scale Big Idea, can be found in the Mid- scale narrative in the NSF -wide priorities chapter. Information on the MRI program can be found in the IA narrative in the R&RA chapter. Dedicated Construction Oversight All projects funded through the MREFC account undergo periodic cost, schedule, and risk reviews as required by the MFG and the terms and conditions of the cooperative agreements. NSF policies and routine reporting are designed to ensure timely and reliable tracking of progress including the use of Earned Value Management, project spending, and use of contingency, and that program managers and recipients each have sufficient oversight and management authority (respectively) to meet project objectives. NSF has greatly strengthened its oversight of major facility proje cts in recent years, with a number of those enhancements now codified in AICA. One significant enhancement is holding a portion of budget contingency (up to 100 percent) and only allocating contingency funds for obligation to the project based on demonstra ted need. This oversight mechanism will generally result in some MREFC carryover each year. However, future obligation of this carryover is anticipated to manage project risks. Enhanced oversight of the construction stage now also includes mandatory incurr ed cost audits and independent cost estimates, as well as other audits and reviews based on NSF's annual major facility portfolio risk assessment. These efforts are conducted by NSF and are generally not attributable to a specific project at the time of bu dget formulation, nor are they part of the total project cost developed and managed by the recipient. To properly support and transparently account for these efforts, actual costs and future estimates for Dedicated Construction Oversight are shown separate ly from each project in the MREFC account table. From FY 2017 through FY 2019, these activities were supported with funds recovered from projects completed in previous years. Beginning i n FY 2020, dedicated funding was requested for these activities in the MREFC account. Oversight of the mid- scale research infrastructure projects is more flexible and tailored to the technical nature of the project . All mid -scale research infrastructure projects funded through the MREFC account will be required to provide a detailed Project Execution Plan for review. The MFG , Section 5, notes that the detailed oversight requirements , and application of major facility oversight practices, will depend on characteristics such as the technical scope, type and mix of work perform ed, and assessment of the technical and programmatic risks. 3 Appropriations Language For necessary expenses for the acquisition, construction, commissioning, and upgrading of major research equipment, facilities, and other such capital assets pursuant to the National Science Foundation Act of 1950 (42 U.S.C. 1861 et seq.), including author ized travel, $243,230,000$229,750,000 , to remain available until expended. 3 AICA c urrently requires the same level of oversight for all projects funded through the MREFC account. NSF is currently seeking a slight modification of AICA language to enable large mid -scale projects to have the more tailored oversight discussed in the MFG.

MREFC - 7 ANTARCTIC INFRASTRUCTURE MODERNIZATION $90,000,000 FOR SCIENCE (AIMS) The Antarctic Infrastructure Modernization for Science construction project w as initiated in FY 2019 with an investment of $103.70 million, followed by $97.89 million in FY 2020 . The FY 2021 Request amount is $90.0 million, the third year in a multi -year funding profile with a Total Project Cost of $410.40 million. and Requested MREFC Funds for the Antarctic Infrastructure Modernization for Science Project (Dollars in Millions) The AIMS project will replace several major structures at McMurdo Station, Antarctica, one of three permanent stations that comprise the U.S. presence in Antarctica, to meet anticipated science support requirements for the next 35 to 50 years while reducin g operations costs . The project will help ensure enduring U.S. leadership and influence in this strategic region. It will also support critical scientific research and capabilities such as nuclear test detection, earthquake monitoring, and real -time weathe r data collection for global forecasting. McMurdo Station's main purpose is to support both near - and deep- field science in Antarctica, including activities at Amundsen -Scott South Pole Station. AIMS will enable faster, more streamlined logistics and science support by co- locating or consolidating field science support, warehousing, skilled trades work, and personnel and administrative support into more operational ly and energy efficient facilities. AIMS will also replace outdated lodging facilities, and p rovide more effective centers for vehicle and equipment operations and emergency operations, as well as upgrade utilities to support these facilities. Previously appropriated funds have been used to procure equipment and construction material that will be transported to McMurdo Station in early FY 2020 and FY 2021, in preparation for the beginning of major AIMS site construction. Site preparation work started in FY 2019 and will continue in FY 2020 along with backbone utilities installation . FY 20 21 funds will be used to begin construction of the Vehicle and Equipment Operations Center (VEOC) , the new lodging facility, and the Central Services building . Site preparation and materials procurement will be done for the water tank and the emergency operations center . The AIMS project is currently anticipated to take up to 10 years to complete. Baseline History In 2011, the Office of Science and Technology Policy and NSF convened a Blue Ribbon Panel (BRP) to evaluate the U.S. Antarctic Program (USAP) logistical enterprise. The BRP was asked to conduct a review of NSF facilities and operations supporting science in Antarctica and to ensure that the facilities can support the scientific opportunities articulated by an earlier 2011 National Research Council report entitled Future Science Opportunities in Antarctica and the Southern Ocean. 1 The BRP report2 made numerous recommendations regarding main taining and enhancing the U.S.'s world- class science program in Antarctica. 1 www.nap.edu/catalog/13169/future -science-opportunities -in-antarctica-and -the-southern- ocean 2 www.nsf.gov/geo/opp/usap_special_review/usap_brp/rpt/index.jsp Major Research Equipment and Facilities Construction MREFC - 8 NSF responded to the BRP report by immediately addressing issues of safety, implementing operational efficiencies that resulted in a rapid return on investment, and developing lon g-term plans for each of the three year -round U.S. stations : Palmer, Amundsen- Scott South Pole , and McMurdo. The AIMS project is a pivotal component of the McMurdo Station Master Plan with a specific focus on the primary core functions of this critical log istics hub. The AIMS project seeks to enhance operational support for science by improving operations efficiency, containing operating costs, and enhancing safety. The following major scope elements are targeted to achieve these goals: Construction of a C entralized Services building that replaces and modernizes multiple existing facilities on station including centralized warehousing. Construction of an Emergency Operations Center to replace the existing f ire station, medical facilities, and f itness and skills development facilities. Construction of a consolidated Field Science Support Facility. Construction of an Industrial Trades Shop to consolidate existing facilities across the station. Construction of a VEOC that facilitates maintenance and repair of both heavy and light equipment ranging from traverse tractors, cranes, loaders, and earth moving equipment to trucks, vans, snowmobiles, and field generators. Construction of one new lodging facility to ensure adequate bed space to support near -term needs, including population surges from an influx of construction workers. Importantly, this facility is comprised primarily of single -occupancy rooms recommended by the BRP to promote safety and health. Shared rooms exacerbate sleep disturbance that can arise fr om widely varying work and travel schedules for the station workforce as well as scientists, and promote the spread of contagious illnesses such as colds and flu. Upgrade of utilities distribution networks for fire protection water, domestic water, heating, power, communications, and sanitary sewer. The Final Design Review was held in October 2018 and the NSB authorized NSF to award a contract for AIMS in February of 2019.

Management and Oversight AIMS is being accomplished under the Federal Acquisition Regulations (FAR) via an existing contract to Leidos Innovations Corporation as the current Antarctic Support Contractor. OPP work s in collaboration with the Division of Acquisition and Cooperative Support (DACS) to use existing contract mechanisms (e.g., monthly program reviews, earned value reporting, award fee evaluation) to ensure rigorous management and oversight of this work. Appropriate NSF major facility oversight requirements apply, including engagement w ith the Large Facilities Office (LFO) and use of an Independent Cost Estimate . Reviews The Conceptual Design Review (CDR) and Preliminary Design Review (PDR) were passed successfully in FY 2015 and FY 2017, respectively, resulting in an NSB resolution (N SB-2017 -20) authorizing NSF to include AIMS in a future budget request. The Final Design Review (FDR) was conducted in October 2018. The external panel found that the project execution plan was well-developed for the FDR and recommended that the project proceed to the construction stage . They also recommended that NSF attempt to retain all the major sc ience- support capabi lities in the original scope , in spite of a cost increase since PDR related to commodity prices and market conditions , in order to realize the long- term benefits to the USAP. An Independent Cost Estimate was also carried out to support NSF's cost analysis in conjunction with the FDR process. In addition to daily communications with Leidos' AIMS project management, NSF conducts a monthly project review. This review covers the monthly project management report p roduced by Leidos. Also planned are annual Cons truction Reviews by NSF management, with the first one to take place i n May, 2020. Major Research Equipment and Facilities Construction MREFC - 10 Project Status Leidos continues to advance the design s with formal intermittent and scheduled design reviews of the different AIMS construction components outlined above, and is completing procurement of long- lead items required to support construction activities . Cost and Schedule FY 2021 funds will be used to do site preparation work , procur e construction materials, and to begin on- site construction . Construction projects to be initiated will include the core utilities , outside cable plant , and Emergency Operations Center. During FY 2021 construction of the VEOC, lod ging facility , and Central Services building will continue . Construction is phased to allo w for minimal impact on science support during construction, as well as ensure continuity of operations in the event that subsequent funding is disrupted. Although the actual execution of the entire AIMS project is expected to take up to 10 years, the proposed appropriation profile is shorter in order to reduce procurement risks. Risks The two main ongoing risks to the project are the market price uncertainty for labor and materials and the uncertainty in the supply chain \u2014getting appropriately skilled workers and materials from the U.S. to McMurdo Station when needed. NSF and Leidos have implemented a rigorous risk management approach which includes the identification of risks and mitigating actions. NSF h olds the risk of cost and schedule increases that are out of control of the contractor, including events such as unpredictably severe weather , icebreaker availability, and macroeconomic changes. Future Operations Costs Implementing AIMS will provide a material reduction in the annual cost to maintain and operate McMurdo Station , including an estimated $1.80 million savings in fuel and $4. 20 million savings in labor and other direct costs in comparison with FY 2018 operating costs. By consolidating the station footprint and using modern energy efficient designs, AIMS will save an estimated 500,000 gallons of fuel per year. Consolidated warehousing and co- located work centers are estimated to reduce the support labor requirement by 80 workers. The new layout will enable improved quality of support and increase the throughput of field science projects. MREFC - 11 DANIEL K. I NOUYE SOLAR TELESCOPE (DKIST) $0 No funding is requested in FY 20 21 for construction of NSF's Daniel K. Inouye Solar Telescope. FY 2019 represent ed the final year in an 11 -year funding profile within a n NSB approved not -to-exceed total project cost of $344.13 million. Completion of construction atop Haleakal on Maui, Hawai'i is planned for no later than June 2020. This narrative provides an update o n the project's status. Prior Years FY $20.00 $20.00 $16.13 - - $344.13Appropriated and Requested MREFC Funds for the Daniel K. Inouye Solar Telescope (Dollars in Millions) 1 FY 2019 was the final year for MREFC funding for DKIST construction. The project is currently on track to complete construction in 2020 within the Total Project Cost cap. When completed, DKIST will be the world's most powerful solar observatory, poised to answer fundamental questions in solar physics by providing transformative improvements over current ground- based facilities. DKIST will enable the study of magnetic phenomena in the solar photosphere, chromosphere, and corona. Determ ining the role of magnetic fields in the outer regions of the Sun is crucial to understanding the solar dynamo, solar variability, and solar activity including flares and coronal mass ejections. Solar activity can affect civil life on Earth through phenome na generally described as space weather and may impact the terrestrial climate. The relevance of DKIST's science drivers was reaffirmed by the National Academies of Sciences, Engineering, and Medicine 2010 Astronomy and Astrophysics decadal survey: New Wor lds, New Horizons in Astronomy and Astrophysics 1 as well as the 2012 Solar and Space Physics d ecadal survey: Solar and Space Phy sics: A Science for a Technological Society .2 DKIST will play an important role in enhancing the \"fundamental understanding of space weather and its drivers,\" an objective called out in the National Space Weather Strategy and associated National Space Weather Action Plan both of which were released b y the National Science and Technology Council in October 2015. An update to the National Space Weather Strategy has been developed through the Space Weather Operations, Research, and Mitigation Working Group of the National Science and Technology Council a nd was informed by community input. This update, entitled National Space Weather Strategy and Action Plan, was released in March 2019. 3 1 telescope enclosure and Support and Operations building at the site on Haleakal , Maui, HI.

Major Research Equipment and Facilities Construction MREFC - 12 Baseline History Beginning in 2001, NSF provided funds to the National Solar Observatory (NSO) for an eight -year development and design program for DKIST and its initial complement of instruments through the Division of Astronomical Sciences (AST) in MPS and through the Di vision of Atmospheric and Geospace Sciences in GEO. The current design, cost, schedule, and risk were scrutinized in an NSF -conducted Preliminary Design Review in October -November 2006. The original total project cost to NSF, $297.93 million, was set aft er a Final Design Review (FDR) in May 2009, which determined that the project was fully prepared to begin construction. The NSB approved an award for this amount at the NSF Director's discretion, contingent upon completion of compliance with relevant envir onmental and cultural/historic statutes. In FY 2009, $153.0 million was appropriated to initiate construction. Funding was provided through a combination of the MREFC account ($7.0 million) and the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act (ARRA) account ($146.0 million). Given the timing of the receipt of budget authority and the complexity of project contracting, the entire $153.0 million was carried over from FY 2009 and obligated in FY 2010. The environmental compliance requirements were completed on Nove mber 20, 2009, and the NSF Director signed the Record of Decision authorizing construction i n December 2009. The Hawai'i Board on Land and Natural Resources (BLNR) approved the project's application for a Conservation District Use Permit (CDUP) in December 2010. A contested case challenge to the 2010 CDUP issuance delayed site construction until the BLNR ruled in favor of the DKIST project and issued a new CDUP in November 2012. Full access to the site atop Haleakal followed shortly thereafter. A ground- breaking ceremony kickin g off site construction was held Decem ber 1, 2012. The unexpected length of the delay associated with the environmental compliance process led to a reassessment of the project schedule and total project cost in 2012. An external pan el of experts reviewed the revised baseline and recommended increasing the total project cost by approximately $46.20 million. The NSB subsequently considered and authorized a revised total project cost of $344.13 million at its August 2013 Design $20.41 - - - - - - - - Operations Maintenance210.50 - 17.54 18.08 18.62 19.13 19.13 19.13 ARRA - - - - ARRA 146.00 - - - - - - - - Subtotal, MREFC $328.00 $16.13 - - - - - million to another awardee for cultural mitigation activities as agreed to during the compliance process.

Other partners include the Air Force Office of Scientific Research and international groups in Germany, the United Kingdom, and Italy. Some partnership activities include: The U.S. Air Force (USAF) replaced the aluminizing chamber at their Advanced Electro -Optical System telescope on Maui and sized it to accommodate the DKIST primary mi rror. An Interagency Agreement for use of the Mirror Coating Facility (MCF) was signed by NSF and the U.S. Air Force in FY 2017. This eliminates the need to build a for DKIST. Leibniz -Institut -band instrument named the Visible Tunable Filter (VTF) as an in- kind contribution. Queens University Belfast (Northern Ireland) is leading a consortium of institutions from the United Kingdom that will supply high -speed vi sible cameras to feed the DKIST instruments. Discussions of other possible contributions for second- generation instruments, algorithm development, coordinated observations, and student exchange are ongoing. Management and Oversight NSF Structure: NSF oversight is handled by a program officer in AST working cooperatively with staff from MPS, the Office of Budget, Finance, and Award Management (BFA), the Office of the General Counsel (OGC) , and the Office of Legislative and Public Affairs. Within BFA , the Large Facilities Office (LFO) provides advice to program staff and assists with agency oversight and assurance. Representatives from the above NSF offices comprise the DKIST Integrated Project Team, which meets on a quarterly basis to disc uss outstanding project issues. External Structure: NSO conducts the construction project. NSF funds NSO operations and maintenance (O&M) and DKIST design and construction via separate c ooperative support agreements (CSAs) beneath an overarching cooperati ve agreement (CA) with the managing organization, the Association of Universities for Research in Astronomy, Inc. (AURA). The DKIST CSA for construction expires June 30, 2020. In 2015, the NSO CA and O&M CSA were renewed through the end of FY 2024.

Several councils and working groups give input from the solar and space physics communities. Reviews Management, Cost, and Schedule reviews: DKIST scope, schedule, budget estimate, and risk- adjusted total project cost were scrutinized and validated at the Preliminary D esign and Final Design Reviews. Programmatic Review: A comprehensive external programmatic review of the DKIST MREFC construction project took place April 8-10, 2019 in Boulder, CO. In addition to an assessment of the project's status against the Project Execution Plan, the review focus ed on establishing the criteria for project close -out and acceptance. The panel's final report was submitted to NSF and the results reviewed by NSF and transmitted to the project. NSF continues to work with the project to address any outstanding recommendations. Earned Value Management (EVM) System Surveillance: In conjunction with the programmatic review described above, a one -day surve illance of the project's EVM system w as conducted on April 10-11, 2019.

FY 202 1 Budget Request to Congress MREFC - 15 Project Status The DKIST project continues to make progress on construction at the summit of Haleakal on Maui, HI, while remaining in compliance with all local, state, and federal environmental and cultural requirements. The project continues to consult with various sta keholders on a regular basis including the Hawai'i Department of Land and Natural Resources, the Hawai'i Department of Fish and Wildlife, the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service, the Federal Aviation Administration, the National Park Service, and Native Hawai'i an cultural practitioners. Construction highlights In early FY 2019, DKIST achieved its first images of star light and completed its first pointing model using a temporary Nighttime Acquisition Telescope mounted at the telescope prime focus. In FY 2019, the project continue d to implement the critical integration, testing, and commissioning (IT&C) phase of construction. Fabrication of the first of the DKIST instruments , the visible broadband imager (VBI), wa s completed and the VBI installed in the DKIST coud\u00e9 laboratory on the summit in FY 201 9. In early FY 2020, the Wave Front Correction (WFC) system was installed and tested on the summit of Haleakala. The WFC is the heart of the DKIST adaptive optics system that corrects for disto rtions due to the Earth's atmosphere. In FY 2020 the project achieved another Level 1 milestone, i.e., first light on the S un through the entire optical path including the WFC. As part of this first -light initiative, the VBI instrument recorded the highes t resolution images of the Sun ever made . In FY 2020 the project will continue to work through the final stages of IT&C and the integrati on of the remaining first-light instruments . By Q 4 of FY 2020, it is expected that DKIST will have achieved its final Level 1 milestone \u2014Start of Operations. Cost and Schedule The original baseline not -to-exceed, risk -adjusted cost was established following FDR. As noted above, a revised project baseline review was held in October 2012; NSB approved the new baseline in August 2013. Total project cost of $344.13 million is derived from ARRA ($146.0 million) and annual appropriations in the MREFC account ($198.13 million). A Monte Carlo analysis of the risk- adjusted project end date at the time of the project re -baseline indicated June 2020 at an 80 percent confidence l evel for successful completion. The project is currently on track for a FY 2020 end date within the authorized funding level of $344.13 million. Risks Project management co ntrol, interface control, and change controls are in place. The project also maintains a risk register that is reviewed and updated monthly. Technical : Most of the remaining technical risk s are relatively low because of the long development and design phase. The CSA between NSF and AURA identifies four facility- class instruments to be delivered by the DKIST project at the end of the MREFC construction phase. The Project is on track to deliver those four instruments. The VTF is a fifth instrument and is an in -kind contribution from the German KIS being designed and developed through a Memorandum of Understanding between AURA and KIS; therefore, the risks for this instrument remain with the German institute. KIS is currently on track to deliver the VTF instru ment to DKIST prior to the start of operations . Major Research Equipment and Facilities Construction MREFC - 16 Environmental and Cultural Compliance : AST, NSF's OGC , and the DKIST project have carefully worked through the applicable statutes, and a cultural monitor has been retained during construction. All required permits are in place and semi -annual consultations with a Native Hawai 'ian working group continue. Following the November 2012 issuance of the CDUP as mentioned in the Baseline History section above, several challenges to both the CDUP and the University of Hawai 'i's Haleakal Observatory (HO) management plan made their way through the State court system. In October 2016, the Hawai 'i Supreme Court ruled against the appellant in both cases, upholding both the project's CDUP and the H O management plan. On March 27, 2019, NSF received approval from the State of Hawai'i Division of Forestry and Wildlife for ear ly termination of its environmental obligations as outlined in the Habitat Conservation Plan (HCP) and Incidental Take License (ITL). Remaining environmental and cultural compliance risks are very low. Environmental Health and Safety: NSO has a well -devel oped safety program engendered in the DKIST project. The DKIST project has developed a site safety plan and conducts annual external safety reviews. In addition, safety updates are provided to NSF by the project on a monthly basis and DKIST project safety is one of the topics covered in the annual external program reviews. Operations Costs DKIST operations are funded through R&RA. In FY 2021, the projected budget is $17.54 million for DKIST operations. FY 2020 was the final year of the 10 -year award for cultural mitigation activities. MREFC - 17 HIGH -LHC Upgrade is $33.0 million . This funding will support ongoing component upgrades of the A Toroidal LHC ApparatuS (ATLAS) and Compact Muon Solenoid (CMS) detectors to operate at the High Luminosity- Large Hadron Collider (HL -LHC). This is the second year of a five -year construction program that is expected to begin in FY 2020. See the Baseline History section below for more details on the approval timeline . High Lumosity-Large Hadron Collider Upgrade 1 Final number is pending NSB authorization, expected February 4, 2020.(Dollars in Millions) The Large Hadron Collider (LHC) is the world's largest and highes t-energy particle accelerator. Located near Geneva, Switzerland and operated by the European Organization for Nuclear Research (CERN), the LHC can accelerate and collide counter -propagating bunches of protons at a total energy of 14 tera -electron volts. Physicists study the debris from these collisions to learn about the elementary particles and fundamental forces that shape the universe. ATLAS and CMS are two general purpose detectors used by researchers to observe these collisions and analyze their characteristics. Detailed discussion of the current opera tions of LHC funded by NSF may be found in the Facilities Chapter. Baseline History Since 2011, U .S. funding for ATLAS and CMS O&M has included investments in advanced research and development ( R&D ) for investigations into detector modifications . These m odifications will enable them to function at much higher collision rates following an upgrade to the LHC to increase its luminosity. The ATLAS and CMS groups, comprised of researchers from all participating countries, each developed a scoping document1 that described its scientific goals and the technical path forward for operation in the challenging HL -LHC environment. In 2014, the Particle Physics Project Prioritization Panel (P5) , a subcommittee of the High Energy Physics Advisory Panel that advises NSF and the U.S. Department of Energy ( DOE ), recommended U .S. participation in the detector upgrades . In fall 2014, MPS charged a subcommittee of the MPS Advisory Committee (MPS AC) to advise on an appropriate response. The subcommittee, with MPS AC endorsement, recommended NSF provide construction funding at the MREFC level to enable meaningful participation by NSF -supported scientists in the HL -LHC research program. In November 2015 , the NSF Director approved entry of the HL -LHC Upgrade to the ATLAS and CMS detectors into the Conceptual Design phase. The principal objectives of this activity were to define a quantitative statement of science requirements, develop a flow -down of the science requirements to a set of technical requirements, define the major technical components, and provide NSF with a top- down estimate of the associated cost, schedule, and risk. Conceptual Design Reviews (CDR) in March -April 2016 1 ATLAS: www.cds.cern.ch/record/1502664?ln=en ; CMS: http://cds.cern.ch/record/2020886 Major Research Equipment and Facilities Construction MREFC - 18 established the maj or functional elements of each detector designated for NSF support and determined that these elements would enable the principal science objectives within the estimated $150.0 million funding envelope defined by NSF in consultation with the MPS A C. In August 2016, the NSF Director approved entry into the Preliminary Design phase. The principal goals of this phase were to develop a detailed technical description of the scope to be fabricated, the risk -adjusted total project cost ( TPC) for each detector based on bottom -up cost estimates, the corresponding resource - loaded schedules, year -by-year budget profiles for construction, and plans for managing risk. NSF directed that th e initial estimated TPC not exceed $150.0 million, or $75.0 million for each detecto r. NSF conducted Preliminary Design Reviews (PDR) of CMS and ATLAS in December 2017 and January 2018 respectively, which established that both projects met the PDR requirements. The review panels expressed confidence that the MREFC scope for each detector upgrade could be accomplished within its individual preliminary $75.0 million MREFC budget target . NSF subsequently carried out a comprehensive cost analysis that supported the basis of estimate for the requested construction budgets. In July 2018, NSB a uthorized the NSF Director to include construction of the High Luminosity upgrades to the ATLAS and CMS detectors in a future B udget R equest. Final Design Reviews (FDR s) held in September 2019 validated the construction -readiness of the upgrade plans. The FDRs established that the potential impacts of remaining pre -construction design and development are adequately bounded within the risk- adjusted budget of each collaboration. In this review process, the CMS budget was adjusted upward by $3.0 million to c over possible increased costs related to critical component s. The NSF director will seek NSB's authorization to begin construction in FY 2020, with a five -year MREFC award Design $24.31 - - - - - - - - estimates are for planning purposes only. The current cooperative agreements end in December 2021 (CMS) and January 2022 (ATLAS). 2 O&M funding represents operations support for the current LHC facility and is forecast to remain constant at a level of $20.50 million during the HL-LHC upgrade. Installation, integration, and system testing of the upgraded detectors will be coordinated by CERN during 2025-2027. NSF's share of installation and commissioning costs is estimated at $5.0 million per detector, which will be funded from the FY 2025-2027 O&M budgets.Total Funding Requirements for HL-LHC Upgrade (Dollars YearsFY 2019 ActualFY 2020 RequestFY 2021 RequestESTIMATES1 2018 2019 2020 2021 2022 2023 2024 2025 2026HL-LHC Upgrades Funding, by Stage (Dollars in Millions) Development & Design (R&RA) Implementation (MREFC) Operations & Maintenance (R&RA) HL-LHC Science Plan Initial operation of the LHC , and the ATLAS and CMS detectors, enabled the discovery of the Higgs boson in 2012, leading to the 2013 Nobel Prize in Physics . The Higgs mechanism explains how fundamental particles acquire mass. This represents the last major piece in the Standard Model of Particle Physics, which descri bes all fundamental particles and their interactions. Despite this historic accomplishment, the ATLAS and CMS experiments have only scratched the surface of the ultimate physics potential of the LHC. There are many open fundamental questions in particle physics. Three key science questions that the HL - LHC program will address are: What are the properties of the Higgs boson? Are there new particles and interactions beyond those predicted by the Standard Model? What is the nature of Dark Matter? To answer these questions, researchers must compare theoretical predictions with observations of various rare processes, such as tho se involving the Higgs boson, that could be sensitive indicators of new physical phenomena. Discovering meaningful departures from theoretical predictions will require high precision measurements and the collection of a data sample more than two orders of magnitude larger than the one used for the Higgs discovery in 2012. To accomplish this, CERN plans to upgrade the accelerator , which will be renamed the High Luminosity- LHC , to deliver the high in tensity proton beams required. In parallel, NSF proposes to fund the construction of critical components of the ATLAS and CMS detectors that will allow them to record and analyze the torrent of data to be produced. The accelerator enhancements and the detector upgrades are expected to be installed and commissioned from 202 5 through mid -2027. More than 45 funding agencies worldwide are contributing various components of the upgraded detectors ; NSF and DOE each anticipate significant contributions, and together fund the U.S. HL -LHC program that is responsive to the P5 recommendation. NSF investments in the upgrades will enable university- based U.S. scientists and students to participate in the HL -LHC experimental program . NSF is working closely with DOE to coordinate development and de sign activities and to jointly o versee each detector's operation. HL- LHC will commence ten years of operation in mid- 2027 to produce more than ten times the data collected by LHC operation through 2024. Major Research Equipment and Facilities Construction MREFC - 20 Management and Oversight NSF Structure : NSF oversight is handled by a program officer in PHY. Cross -foundation coordination is provided by an integrated project team that includes staff from MPS, BFA, EHR, OISE, the Office of the Director, the Office of the General Counsel, and the Office of L egislative and Public Affairs. Within BFA, the Large Facilities Office and the Division of Acquisition and Cooperative Support provide advice to program staff and assist with agency oversight and assurance. The MPS Facilities team and NSF's Chief Officer f or Research Facilities also provides high- level guidance and oversight support for the project. The NSF program officer works closely with PHY colleagues overseeing the Experimental Particle Physics research program at NSF, and with counterparts in the DOE Office of High Energy Physics. Interagency coordination is accomplished through a Joint Oversight Group (JOG), which meets semi -annually. The framework for joint DOE/NSF oversight of the U.S. led portion of the international ATLAS and CMS collaborations has a successful history spanning two decades. It is based on an initial interagency memorandum of understanding (MOU) implemented in December 1999 and superseded in March 2018 to encompass HL -LHC activities. External Structure : NSF -funded principal invest igators at Columbia and Cornell will be responsible for accomplishing the NSF -designated scope. NSF - and DOE -funded activities, which together form the U.S. collaboration for ATLAS and CMS, are coordinated through the JOG as described above. The U.S. colla boration s coordinate with the international ATLAS and CMS project leadership to accomplish the entire upgrade program. The NSF construction scope for ATLAS and CMS was selected, at the outset of Conceptual Design, to be minimally coupled to other construct ion activities of DOE or international partners so that NSF's construction can be executed as two relatively independent projects within the overall scope of upgrade activities. NSF currently receives monthly financial and technical status reports on pre- construction planning activities . Revisions to the scope, budget, and schedule baselines will be reported to NSF, and revisions exceeding thresholds defined in the cooperative agreements for construction will require prior NSF approval. Interaction with CE RN: In May 2015, DOE, NSF, and CERN executed a c ooperation agreement concerning scientific and technical cooperation in nuclear and particle physics. The c ooperation agreement establishes the framework under which DOE , NSF, and their awardees, as well as DOE national laboratories , participate in the particle physics programs in the international ATLAS and CMS detector collaborations (under the auspices of CERN ) in the era of th e HL -LHC. Subject to availability of appropriated funds, NSF's total contributions to the HL -LHC Upgrade program will be specified and incorporated under separate implementing arrangements in the form of addenda to the 2015 c ooperation agreement . The CERN LHC Resources Review Boards (separate boards for ATLAS and CMS) are composed of representatives from each participating funding agency. The Boards monitor and oversee resource -related matters as defined by the framework for participation in each experiment . NSF is a full member of these LHC Resources Review Boards. The Boards meet semi -annually to approve all LHC upgrade planning at the international level. Reviews CDR : March 2016 (ATLAS); March and April 2016 (CMS). PDR : January 2018 (ATLAS); December 2017 (CMS). Review of the O&M Plans of ATLAS and CMS for CY 2017- 2021 (whose scope includes development and design activities for the detector upgrades): July 2016 (ATLAS); July 2016 (CMS). CERN international committee reviews: Major subsystems of the combin ed international effort were scientifically and technically reviewed by the CERN LHC Committee (LHCC), an international FY 2021 Budget Request to Congress MREFC - 21 committee of technical experts, followed by a cost and schedule review by the CERN Upgrade Cost Group, an international committee of tec hnical and financial experts, which reported to the LHCC (July 2017- April 2018). FDR: September 2019 (ATLAS and CMS). Full Life -cycle Cost Reviews: NSF held reviews of the cost impacts of the MREFC upgrades on the LHC operations program in October 2019. Project Status The ATLAS and CMS FDR s established that each detector collaboration had completed all NSF -mandated pre-construction preparation needed to enable construction to comme nce in April 2020. The FDR panels considered each of the constructi on readiness criteria in NSF 's Major Facilities Guide and advised NSF on whether they had been satisfied. The FDR panels also evaluate d the sufficiency of each collaboration 's response to the recommendations from prior reviews and offered suggestions to NS F on areas to follow closely during construction. NSF and the NSB are conducting additional assessments to assure readiness for an April 2020 construction start. NSF's Large Facilities Office is leading an Independent Cost Estimate of each project as part of the overall cost assessment process carried out by BFA. These will be completed and satisfactorily reconciled prior to awarding construction funds in FY 2020 . Cost and Schedule The planned April 2020 construction start date is dictated by the need to complete fabrication and delivery to CERN to meet the international integration schedule for CY 2025-2027. A significant delay could result in the transfer of critical NSF -funded scope to other international partners for accomplishment, resulting in lost l eadership opportunities for U .S. scientists. NSF's contributions to the ATLAS and CMS upgrades represent about six percent of the international detector upgrade program. The MREFC project will be completed when the NSF -funded apparatus is delivered and passes verification of delivery in good condition at CERN. Installation, integration, and system testing will be coordinated by CERN during CY 2025-2027. NSF's share of installation and commissioning costs is estimated at about $5.0 million per detector, which will be funded from the FY 2025- FY 2027 O&M budgets. The annual O&M cost is forecast to remain constant during and following the HL -LHC U pgrade ins tallation. Risks Technical Risk : Technical designs are sufficiently mature to credibly support estimates of the costs to complete development and industrialization, and of construction. Remaining technical decisions during the Final Design stage have credibly bounded cost and schedule impacts. There are multiple alternatives for dealing with the remaining design uncertainties. Deployment Risk : The MREFC project concludes with delivery and verification of subcomponent operability at CERN. CERN has overal l responsibility for assembly, integration, and commissioning of the upgraded detectors, integrating the contributions from more than 40 different countries. While a slip in the CERN schedule will delay scientific research, the total project cost of the NS F-funded construction projects is not anticipated to increase. A significant delay may increase demands on NSF's O&M beyond 2027. Management Risk : The FDRs established that the ATLAS and CMS management teams are well -qualified and well prepared to underta ke the proposed construction activities, with appropriate organizational structures and delegations of responsibility. The review committees reported each team's development of cost and schedule estimates was based on sound assumptions and methods that are consistent with best practices defined by the Government Accountability Office in the Cost Estimat ing and Schedule Major Research Equipment and Facilities Construction MREFC - 22 Assessment guides. The FDR panels also expressed confidence that each upgrade can be accomplished within its estimated TPC , after adjusting the CMS estimate upward by $3.0 million to cover possible increased costs related to critical component s. The ATLAS and CMS Project Execution Plans include detailed risk management considerations and mitigation strategies. The risk impacts of remaining development uncertainties, prior to the start of construction, are reasonably bounded within the proposed cost, scope, and schedule estimates. Partnership Risk : The NSF scope for the detector upgrades relies on the successful and timely completion of development testing by international partners of some key component s, such as radiation- tolerant custom electronic circuits. A second partnership risk is that the detector fabrication activities within the NSF scope rely in part on DOE and NSF research grants to universities . Faculty, post -docs, and graduate students will participate in the management, testing, characterization, and software development of detector components fabricated by engineers and technicians. While the engineering and technic al labor is funded through the MREFC awards, the faculty, post -docs, and graduate students are supported by research grants from DOE and NSF to universities and colleges. Risks and contingency budgets were refined through the FDR process to assure NSF that part nership risks are confidently addressed. Disposal Costs : CERN's policy is to dispose of all detector components when they are no longer used in the detectors . NSF will be responsible only for covering i ts share of the demolition costs to remove each detec tor from its underground operating location and transport it to the surface for disposal by CERN. At the Full Life -Cycle Cost Reviews each detector estimated these costs at approximately $1-2 million ( not escalated). Future Operations Costs An additional agreement between NSF, DOE, and CERN (\"Experiments Protocol II \"), signed in December 2015, documents the responsibilities of U .S. participants to provide normal maintenance and operation of detector subsystems and components provided by NSF a nd DOE. Future MOUs with CERN will describe the distribution of tasks and other responsibilities for all participating institutions, including those supported by NSF, as well as the organizational, managerial, and financial guidelines to be followed by eac h detector collaboration. NSF anticipates providing approximately three percent of the total operation cost of the ATLAS and CMS detectors during HL -LHC operation (as it does today). This proportion is based on the number of NSF -supported sci entists in each collaboration. NSF's external reviews of the impacts of the HL upgrades on future operating costs indicated that these operating cost projections are reasonable and are based on realistic assumptions. A well -orchestrated global effort is underway, progr essing in parallel with the HL -LHC detector upgrades, to meet the challenges of computing in the HL era . ATLAS and CMS are coordinating their efforts within this framework to seek common solutions. This improved coordination extends to the U.S. funding agencies, other funding agencies, and CERN. NSF conducted external reviews (the Full Life -Cycle Cost Reviews mentioned earlier) of the impacts of future computing needs on the operations program. The reviewers expressed confidence that the multiple software research programs now underway to address these challenges are likely to provide affordable solutions. Many of the R&D tasks underway are promising, and only a subset needs to be successful to meet the needs of the HL operating program. MREFC - 23 MID -SCALE RESEARCH INFRASTRUCTURE TRACK 2 $65,000,000 (MID -SCALE RI -2) The Mid -scale Research Infrastructure program is a n NSF-wide effort to meet the research community's needs for modern research infrastructure to support priority science and engineering research. The overall Mid-scale RI program is described in the NSF -wide Investments chapter of this Budget Request. Here, we describe Tra ck 2 (Mid- scale RI -2) of this \"enabling\" B ig Idea, covering projects with individual implementation costs between $20.0 million and $ 100.0 million,1 with funding Funds for the Mid-Scale Research Infrastructure Track 2 Program (Dollars in Millions) Baseline History The scientific importance of mid -scale research infrastructure is reflected in the 2017 American Innovation and Competitiveness Act (AICA) , which directed NSF to \"evaluate the existing and future needs, across all disciplines supported by the Foundation, for m id-scale projects.\" NSF issued a Request for Information in late 2017 that resulted in nearly 200 ideas for research infrastructure with project costs in the $20 .0 million to $100.0 million range, amounting to a prospective demand for approximately $10 bil lion in funding. Mid- scale RI -2 funding is intended to respond directly to that demand. In the 2018 appropriation for NSF, report language from the House of Representatives directed \"the National Science Board (NSB), in collaboration with the National Academies of Science, Engineering, and Medicine (NASEM), to consider steps to bridge the gap between the NSF's Major Research Instrumentation Program (MRI) and the agency's Major Research Equipment and Facility Construction (MREFC) account and to develop appropriate processes to address this matter through the MREFC account within a restricted funding environment. \" An NSF -wide strategy for mid -scale projects, also directed by AICA, was deferred until the NSB completed their report in response to the Congressional direction. In that report (NSB -18- 40), 2 the first two of the four recommendations of NSB were the following: NSF should affirm and sustain the mid- scale Big Idea with a long -term agency -level commitment to mid-scale research infrastructure. NSF should investigate the feasibility of using the MREFC account as one possible funding mechanism. NSF responded to these recommendations and the AICA mandate to develop a strategy with the detailed Mid-scale RI program that is described in the NSF -Wide Investments chapter of this Budget Request. As part of that strategy, funding for the mid- scale projects with implementation costs above $20.0 million was requested in the MREFC account as Track 2 of an NSF -wide mid -scale program, and funding was appropriated in that account in FY 2020. NSF issued its first solicitation for Mid -scale RI -2, NSF 19- 542, 3 1 The first NSF -wide Mid -scale RI -2 solicitation called for implementation proposals with total project costs in the range from $20.0 million to $70.0 million. The long-term intent is for Mid -scale RI -2 to cover a range extending up to $100.0 million, to be maximally consistent with the definition of major multi-user research facility projects in the American Innovation and Competitiveness Act. 2 www.nsf.gov/nsb/publications/2018/NSB -2018 -40-Midscale-Research -Infrastructure -Report -to-Congress - Research Equipment and Facilities Construction MREFC - 24 in December 2018, requesting proposals with total implementation costs in the range between $20.0 million and $70.0 million. Since Mid -scale RI -2 is intended to be a portfolio of implementation awards that may range across all NSF communities, it does not have a single set of a -priori scientific goals. In the initial solicitation, NSF stated that \"t he Mid -scale Research Infrastructure Program is aim ed at transforming scientific and engineering research fields as well as science, technology, engineering and mathematics (STEM) education research fields by making available new capabilities, while simultaneously training early- career researchers in the development, design, and construction of cutting- edge infrastructure.\" The solicitation specifically called for proposals \"that comprise any combination of equipment, instrumentation, computational hardware and software, and the necessary commissioning and human capital in support of implementation of the same.\" Past examples of mid-scale- size awards in individual directorates have included items such as mid -size telescopes or telescope systems, replacement of the Palmer Pier in Antarctica, advanced supercom puting systems, and higher - - - - - - Subtotal, R&RA - - - - - - - - - MREFC: Implementation EstimatePrior YearsFY 2019 Actual 1Operations costs to be borne by the lead disciplinary directorates are not included in this table but are discussed below in the section on Future Operations Costs.FY 2021 RequestESTIMATES Management and Oversight Mid-scale RI -2 proposals have been solicited from all disciplines covered by NSF, as noted above. In anticipation of the funding of such proposals, the NSF Major Facilities Guide (NSF 19 -068) 4 was updated with an extensive discussion of management and oversight processes for Mid- scale RI, found in Section 5 of that Guide. Because of the varied nature of potential Mid -scale RI -2 awards, the Major Facilities Guide states the following: \"Mid -scale project oversight requirements are to be tailored based on each project's unique characteristics such as the technical scope, the type and mix of work performed (e.g. standard procurement by the Recipient, software development, or civil construction), and an assessment of the associated technical and programmatic risks. However, NSF is committed to the principle that this flexibilit y does not preclude the requirement for appropriate rigor on the part of NSF or the Recipient. Appropriate use of NSF major facility oversight practices will be determined on a case -by-case basis.\" 4 www.nsf.gov/pubs/2019/nsf19068/nsf19068.pdf FY 2021 Budget Request to Congress MREFC - 25 In order to enable appropriate oversight, all Mid- scale RI-2 proposals were required to submit an extensive Project Execution Plan that will help NSF determine the appropriate oversight for each project once awards are made. Reviews The Mid -scale RI -2 proposals do not go through the Conceptual/Preliminary/Final Design stages of major facility projects, enabling a more agile process for these substantial, but smaller, projects. However, t he Mid-scale RI -2 program only considers projects at a high state o f readiness for implementation that have reached that mature stage through previous developmental investments. The solicitation was designed to include a two -step, pre -proposal/full -proposal process in order to limit the burden on the research community of both preparing and reviewing full proposals. Lead NSF directorates were identified for the review of each pre- proposal and proposal, based on the proposal submissions and assessments by NSF. Pre- proposals were externally reviewed according to the standard NSF merit review criteria and six solicitation - specific review criteria, with a subset invited to submit full proposals. Those full proposals were again externally reviewed, with a subset of these full proposals invited to a Reverse Site Visit (again with an external panel) for detailed assessment of the Project Execution Plans. Based on the extensive input from external merit review, t he most meritorious proposals were identified by the lead directorates and submitted to the Mid -scale RI -2 Working Group. That working group prepared sample portfolios of those proposals at different levels of total funding, and forwarded them to the Office of the Director . The Director will recommend a portfolio of awards to the National Science Board at its May 2020 meetin g, which will consider the portfolio and then authorize any awards. All proposals reaching this final stage of portfolio selection demonstrate highly meritorious science. The final portfolio recommendation also will include consideration of the project readiness as evaluated by the Reverse Site Visits, breadth of science disciplines to be awarded, diversity in awardees and awardee institutions, and contributions to student training and workforce development. During the recommendation process, NSF 's Office of Budget, Finance, and Award Management will also carry out rigorous cost analyses of the projects that are candidates for award , consistent with AICA requirements for MREFC -funded projects , and in order to assure best value for the taxpayer dol lar. It is anticipated that the first awards will be started with the funds appropriated by Congress in FY 2020. Project Status The final steps in the portfolio selection and award process are in progress and anticipated for completion late in FY 2020. Depending on the status of the Project Execution Plans and the NSF cost analyses, some awards may not be made until FY 2021. Cost and Schedule FY 2020 funds will be used to make the first Mid -scale RI -2 awards, most of which are anticipated to last for five years. A sample budget portfolio for multiple solicitation rounds is shown in the table below. Major Research Equipment and Facilities Construction MREFC - 26 2 - - 35.00 35.00 35.00 30.00 Solicitation 3 - - Total $65.00 Porfolio (Dollars in Millions) Risks Technical risks and risk management for the individual projects have been included as part of the Project Execution Plans and evaluated rigorously by an external panel of experts. The final portfolio recommendation will also rely significantly on an evaluation of agency risks. These will in clude, for example, a constraint that not all of the projects should be very high or very low risk, assessment of any potential partnership risks, the risk that events out of the control of an awardee might significantly impact an individual project, or th e risk of overcommitting future budgets such that the next solicitation might be significantly delayed . Future Operations Costs The Mid -scale RI -2 solicitation specifically prohibited inclusion of operations costs in the individual project budgets, but p roposers were required to present operations and utilization plans as well as esti mates of full lifecycle costs. For each individual proposal considered for inclusion in the award portfolio, the lead directorate was required to estimate and commit to any additional operations costs in order to reap the scientific benefits of an award. At a hypothetical level of $ 220.0 million in awards from the first solicitation, and anticipating maximum operations costs of 10 percent of the capital costs per year, the tot al operations cost impact from the first round of Mid- scale RI -2 awards would ramp up to a steady state of no more than $22.0 million per year by about FY 2025. If any awarded proposals in the portfolio are upgrades to existing facilities or instrumentatio n, the anticipated increment to annual operations costs c ould be considerably less. MREFC - 27 REGIONAL CLASS RESEARCH VESSELS (RCRV) $0 The RCRV Project is being constructed in a three -year funding profile within a n NSB approved not -to- exceed total project cost o f $353.97 million.

What are the rates, mechanisms, impacts, and geographic variability of sea level ch ange? 2. How are the coastal and estuarine ocean and their ecosystems influenced by the global hydrologic cycle, land use, and upwelling from the deep ocean? 3. How have ocean biogeochemical and physical processes contributed to today's climate and its variabili ty, and how will this system change over the next century? 4. What is the role of biodiversity in the resilience of marine ecosystems and how will it be affected by natural and anthropogenic changes? 5. How different will marine food webs be at mid- century? In t he next 100 years? 6. What are the processes that control the formation and evolution of ocean basins? 7. How can risk be better characterized and the ability to forecast geohazards like mega- earthquakes, tsunamis, undersea landslides, and volcanic eruptions be improved? 8. What is the geophysical, chemical, and biological character of the subseafloor environment and how does it affect global elemental cycles and understanding of the origin and evolution of life? Baseline History The RCRV project is a major component in the plan for modernizing the U.S. Academic Research Fleet. 2 In 2001, a report from the Federal Oceanographic Facilities Committee documented the need for Regional Class vessels. In 2004, NSF and the Naval Sea Systems Command (NAVSEA) e ntered into an interagency agreement that resulted in two candidate designs for Regional Class ships. In 2007, the Federal Oceanographic Fleet Status Report identified the need for NSF -built Regional Class vessels to meet future science demand. In 2009, another National Academies report, Science at Sea, described the desirable characteristics of a modern Regional Class vessel. These characteristics and other science community factors were considered by the review panel when the preferred NAVSEA design was l ater down -selected. In 2012, NSF issued a solicitation for the refreshed design and potential construction of RCRV. Oregon State University (OSU) was selected and received the award in 2013.

Cross- Foundation coordination is provided by an FY 2021 Budget Request to Congress MREFC - 29 Integrated Project Team (IPT). The IPT includes staff from the BFA Large Facilities O ffice, BFA Division of Acquisition and Cooperative Support, BFA Division of Institution and Award Support, Office of the Director, Office of the General Counsel, Office of the Assistant Director for Geosciences, and Office of Legislative and Public Affairs . External Structure: The RCRV project is funded through a series of cooperative agreements with OSU to manage the design refresh (conceptual, preliminary, and final designs), construction, testing and trials, and eventual operation of the first RCRV for t he scientific community. The principal investigator for the award is the project manager (PM), who reports directly to the OSU Dean of the College of Earth, Ocean, and Atmospheric Sciences. The PM interacts directly with the NSF Program Officer and manages the RCRV administrative staff. The project scientist is a co -principal investigator on the award. The PM manages the core RCRV team including the risk manager, earned value management and schedule specialists, contracting officer, and OSU shipyard represe ntative (SR). The SR in turn manages the naval architect and engineering contract and oversees the OSU shipyard staff and marine science technical advisors. The RCRV Science Oversight Committee (SOC), with regional representation, multidisciplinary experti se, and independent science representatives conducting research in mission areas supported by stakeholder federal agencies (e.g., NSF, Office of Naval Research , and National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration ) will be active through all project phases. The SOC provides guidance to the OSU RCRV project team through the PM and/or the NSF program officer. Reviews Proposal Review: In 2012, NSF issued Solicitation 12- 558, Construction of Regional Class Research Vessels, which resulted in the selection of O SU as the lead institution for construction and ship operations. RCRV proceeded through the standard NSF processes that included a Conceptual Design Review (December 2013), Preliminary Design Review (August 2014) and Final Design Review (December 2016). Th e Final Design Review (FDR) ensured that anticipated project costs remained realistic and that no unforeseen events had arisen prior to the start of construction during FY 2017. The FDR Panel recommended that the project advance to the Construction Stage. Annual Progress Review: The first construction stage review was conducted in August 2018. Progress towards Design Verification and Transfer and OSU's management of the shipyard contract was evaluated. The panel expressed confidence that the OSU Team is well qualified, has extensive relevant experience in ship acquisition, has established a positive, professional working relationship with Gulf Island Shipyards , and is entirely capable of delivering up to three RCRV s, within budget and on schedule, that will meet mission requirements. Quarterly Management Reviews are conducted at the shipyard. An Annual Project Review with an External Panel is planned for February 2020 at Gulf Island Shipyards. Project Status OSU is managing the construction and transition to operations through a cooperative agreement with NSF, which encompasses the entire project, including tests and trials. The project is divided into four distinct phases, each to be funded through separate c ooperative support agreements, with award of each phase contingent upon successful completion of the prior phase. These phases are: Phase I: Project Refresh (Years one to three) Phase II: Shipyard Selection (Year four) Phase III: Construction (Years five through eight) Phase IV: Transition to Operations (Years eight and nine) Major Research Equipment and Facilities Construction MREFC - 30 The project completed Phase II in CY 2017, during which bids for construction of RCRV were solicited and evaluated from U.S. shipyards. The project is now in Phase III construction. Keel -laying for the first RCRV, named R/V Taani , was completed in November 2018 and for the second RCRV, named R/V Resolution , in May 2019. A keel - laying for the third RCRV, named R/V Gilbert R. Mason, is planned for Spring 2020. The RCRV project includes up to one year of sea trials and science equipment testing/trials for each vessel after delivery from the shipyard to ensure readiness to safely and efficiently conduct science operations before entry into the U.S. Academic Research Fleet. This wi ll mark the beginning of Phase IV Transition to Operations. R/V Taani , the first ship in the Class, is currently scheduled to be delivered in Fall 2021 and will likely begin operations in mid- late 2022. The project is planning a six- month stagger between vessel deliveries, with the projection that R/V Resolution will enter the ARF in early 2023 and R/V Gilbert R. Mason will enter in mid-late 2023. Cost and Schedule The length of the project is projected to be nine years, including nine months of schedu le contingency. Funding for the construction of RCRV from FY 2017 through FY 2019 supports the shipyard contract structure. Total estimated funding to OSU for RCRV through FY 2020 is $11.39 million in R&RA funds for development and design and $328.0 million in MREFC funds for construction. A standard NSF oversight practice is to hold a portion of budget contingency and only allocating to the program, for obligation to the project, based on demonstrated need. This oversight mechanism will generally result in some MREFC carry over each year; however, future obligation is anticipated to manage project risks. An additional $25.97 million in MREFC funding is held by NSF for contingency. Risks Technical : The following technical risks are among the princ ipal risks identified on OSU's project risk register. Planned mitigation strategies are included here with each identified risk. (1) Various situations may occur that could delay or add cost to OSU's management portion of the project. These include delayed appointments of key personnel, contracting issues, lack of management capacity due to optimistic planning, or misunderstanding of requirements. Contingency funds are included to increase OSU management capacity if needed. (2) Sonar sensors, science load h andling systems, and other vessel sub- systems may not perform as required. Contingency funds are included to ensure performance capabilities are met, given that many warranties are not likely to be performance- based or are otherwise limited contractually w ith the shipyard. (3) Growth in weight and vertical center of gravity has required design changes, namely lengthening by six feet, to ensure vessel seaworthiness. This is a typical risk for ship construction (and research vessels in particular) that requir es active management by OSU and the shipyard, as well as oversight by NSF, such that the ship can operate safely and effectively. This risk is reduced by the re -design but will not be entirely eliminated until the as -built ship is evaluated. Approximately $21.96 million in contingency has been allocated to- date as a result of realizing known risks. A science- prioritized, time -phased de -scoping plan is in place (per NSF Large Facilities Manual, NSF17- 066) to minimize impacts to science capabilities in case contingency funds are insufficient to cover realized risks. FY 2021 Budget Request to Congress MREFC - 31 Future Operations Costs Annual ship operations costs are well understood after several decades of experience with vessels of all types in the U.S. Academic Research Fleet. OSU included an estimate for the first year of operations beginning in 2022 using reasonable assumptions for escalations through 2021. They also assumed a robust but reasonable operating schedule of 200 days per year. OSU estimates each RCRV will cost $7. 0 million to operate in its first full year, resulting in a rate of approximately $35,000 per day, including technician support. This is comparable to the operation of current similar vessels after applying the appropriate cost escalation factors for size and complexity. NSF supports approximately 70 percent of the use of the U.S. Academic Research Fleet, which suggests RCRV is likely to cost NSF approximately $ 2.45 million in FY 2022 for six months of operations of the R/V Taani . The ultimate annual cost of approximately $14.70 million for operating three RCRVs will be balanced by cost savings from reducing scope elsewhere in the U.S. Academic Research Fleet. Solicitations for operations of additional vessels beyond the first RCRV (R/V Taani ) operated by OSU were released in January 2018 and July 2019. The East Coast Oceanographic Consortium, whose members include the University of Rhode Island, the Woods Hole Oceanographic Institution, and the University of New Hampshire School of Marine Science and Ocean Engineering, along with 13 associate members, was selected to operate the second RCRV (R/V Resolution). The Gulf - Caribbean Oceanographic Consortium, whose members include the University of Southern Mississippi, the Louisiana Univer sity Marine Consortium, and 15 associate members, was selected to operate the third RCRV (R/ V Gilbert R. Mason) . MREFC - 32 VERA C. RUBIN OBSERVATORY $40,750,000 The FY 2021 Request for the Vera C. Rubin Observatory is $40.75 million. This is the eighth year of support for a nine -year construction project that began in August 2014. The NSB authorized award is $473.0 million for NS's contribution. FY Funds for the Vera C. Rubin Observatory (Dollars in Millions) Prior to the FY 2021 Request, this project had been called the Large Synoptic Survey Telescope. F ollowing the passage of the Vera C. Rubin Observatory Designation Act ( P.L. 116- 97), the facility is now named the Vera C. Rubin Observatory. The facility's new name honors Dr. Rubin, an American astronomer who made a concerted effort to improve diversity in astronomy and whose pioneering studies of galactic rotation rates provided important evidence for the wide -spread existence of dark matter , one of the key science areas for the project. The Vera C. Rubin Observatory will be comprised of an 8.4- meter wide -field optical telescope in Chile with a 3.2 giga -pixel camera and an advanced data management system, which together are designed to carry out a deep survey of nearly half of the sky. The Rubin Observatory's initial 10 -year survey has a cadence enabling repeat observation of each survey field approximately twice weekly. The requirements for the Vera C. Rubin Observatory and the survey were set by considering four key science areas: the physics of dark energ y and dark matter ; a census of small bodies in the Solar System, including potentially hazardous Near -Earth Objects (NEOs) ; the structure and contents of the Milky Way G alaxy ; and the nature of transient astronomical objects on time scales ranging from seconds to years. By satisfying the requirements defined by these key investigations, the Vera C. Rubin Observatory's initial survey will result in a comprehensive data set that will enable hundreds of fundamental astrophysical studies by the entire research community on these and other topics. Thus, the Vera C. Rubin Observatory has the potential to advance every field of astronomical study, from the inner Solar System to the large -scale structure of the Universe. Baseline History The Vera C. Rubin Observa tory is a joint NSF and Department of Energy (DOE) project to build an instrument that was ranked as the top large ground- based astronomy project recommended by the National Academies of Sciences, Engineering, and Medicine 2010 Astronomy and Astrophysics decadal survey : New Worlds, New Horizons in Astronomy and Astrophysics .1 Prior to NSF's construction award, NSF, DOE, and private (non- federal) partners invested over $130.0 million in Vera C. Rubin Observatory- related work. About 70 percent supported design and development and about 30 percent, from the non- federal funding, supported casting and polishing of the innovative combined primary- tertiary mirror (M1M3), initial site preparation, and prototype detector creation and evaluation, all of which significantly reduced construction risk. 1 www.nap.edu/catalog/12951/new -worlds -new MREFC - 33 NSF and DOE conducted a series of revi ews in 2011 and 2012 to determine the project baseline, including the NSF Preliminary Design Review and a subsequent cost estimation review. Plans were kept up -to-date to synchronize the DOE and NSF funding profiles as reviews continued, leading to NSF's F inal Design Review (FDR) in December 2013. NSF then carried out a detailed cost analysis prior to completing its approval process and making an award in the last quarter of FY Design $57.13 - - - - - - - - Operations & Maintenance2- - 5.00 14.32 FY 2020.1 Outyear funding estimates are for planning purposes only and represent preliminary estimates.

Rubin Observatory Funding, by Stage (Dollars in Millions) Implementation (MREFC) Operations &Maintenance (R&RA)Major Research Equipment and Facilities Construction MREFC - 34 Vera C. Rubin Observatory Science Plan The site on Cerro Pach \u00f3n, Chile, was selected for the Vera C. Rubin Observatory because of the excellent sky transparency and image quality, dark skies, small fraction of cloudy nights, and the geological characteristics that enable the rapid telesco pe motions required to carry out Vera C. Rubin Observatory 's ten-year survey. The Rubin Observatory will collect about 20 terabytes of multi -color imaging data every night2 for 10 years, producing a long- lived data set of unprecedented utility. It will produce the widest -field sky image ever and issue alerts for changing and transient objects within 60 seconds of their discovery. Repeated deep imaging of every part of the accessible sky will turn up explosive events such as cataclysmic variable stars, supernovae, and the optical counterparts of X -ray flashes, as well as finding moving objects and better characterizing those already known. Estimates of the Vera C. Rubin Observ atory 's ability to locate NEOs3 and Potentially Hazardous Asteroids (PHAs)3 have been refined by Observatory project members ,4 as well as by external studies, including an independent Jet Propulsion Laboratory study5 supported by NASA's Planetary Defens e Coordination Office. Assuming other existing NEO efforts continue, at the end of the Vera C. Rubin Observatory 's 10 -year prime mission, the catalogue for objects larger than about 140 meters across should be about 75 percent complete for NEOs (about 80 percent for PHAs). Without the Vera C. Rubin Observatory, the completeness would be about 60 percent for NEOs (about 65 percent for PHAs). The Vera C. Rubin Observatory 's data will be widely accessible, and discovery opportunities will be available to K -12 students as easily as to professional astronomers. An innovative citizen science program will involve people of all ages in Rubin Observatory discoveries. About half the cost during operations is for data management, including the development of user -friendly interfaces tailored for the different anticipated communities. The survey strategy makes the same data set usable for the astronomy community as well as for educators and the general public. Management and Oversight NSF Structure : NSF oversight is handled by a program officer in the MPS Division of Astronomical Sciences (AST) working cooperatively with NSF staff through the Integrated Project Team with members from MPS, OISE, BFA, the Office of General Counsel , the Office of Legislative and Public Affairs , and the Office of the Director. Within BFA, the Large Facilities Office provides advice to program staff and assists with agency oversight and assurance. The MPS Facilities team and NSF's Chief Officer for Research Facilities also provide high -level guidance and oversight support for the project. The NSF program officer works closely with counterparts in the DOE Office of High Energy Physics, who have oversight responsibility for the construction of the camera. Interagency coordination is accomplished through weekly meetings of a J oint Oversight Group and was formalized through a Memorandum of Understanding signed in July 2012. External Structure : The responsible awardee for the Vera C. Rubin Observatory construction is the Association of Universities for Research in Astronomy, Inc. (AURA), a non- profit science management corporation. T he Vera C. Rubin Observatory Project Office i s an AURA- managed center for construction , and AURA established a separate management council that oversees this Project Office. The Observatory 's project director and proj ect manager are experienced in large facility construction and operation and are appointed by AURA, with the approval of NSF and DOE. AURA is also the responsible awardee for the 2 See Ivezi et al. (2019), The Astrophysical Journal , 873, 111. 3 NEOs are objects that come within 1.3 astronomical units (au, the distance from Earth to Sun) of the Sun, which means they come near Earth's orbit. PHAs are defined as objects that come within a distance of 0.05 au (roughly 4,650,000 miles) of Earth and a re larger than roughly 140 meters in diameter . 4 www.doi.org/10.1016/j.icarus.2017.11.033 5 www.arxiv.org/abs/1705.06209 FY 2021 Budget Request to MREFC - 35 Vera C. Rubin Observatory pre-operations ramp- up activity that began in Octob er 2018. AURA is responsible for coordinating construction activities and pre -operations activities that are executed side -by- side. Reviews Technical Reviews : Stage -gate r eviews were conducted throughout the Design Stage , culminating in NSF's FDR in December 2013, with DOE involvement. All major subsystems have undergone regular system - level reviews organized by the Vera C. Rubin Observatory Project Office during Design and Construction. Management, Cost, and Schedule Re views : Cost, schedule, and risk are also scrutinized by the technical reviews. During construction, NSF and DOE hold regular joint progress reviews. The m ost recent reviews are summarized below The f ifth joint agency progress review occurred in August 201 9 and was successful. An Earned Value Management System (EVMS) surveillance review coincided with the 2019 annual progress review and is used to evaluate the project's alignment with Government Accountability Office (GAO) good practices on schedule . This review determined that the Vera C. Rubin Observatory EVMS continues to meet both the intent of the American National Standards Institute/Electronic Industries Alliance standard , EIA-748-C, Earned Value Management Systems (EVMS ) guidelines and NSF requirement s for EVMS , and there we re no findings or corrective actions. In December 2017, NSF and DOE held a joint review of the project's proposal for operations of the full ten -year survey, plus an additional four years of pre -operations ramp up activity and two yea rs of post-survey activity. The review was successful, and N SF and DOE began initial funding of early pre - operations activity in FY 2019 (with NSF providing $11.10 million in 2019- FY 2021) additional for FY 2021 to cover NSF's increased costs associated with t he revised co -funding model with DOE, as described in the Future Operations Costs section below . Project Status NSF's construction award was issued in August 2014. As of November 2019, the project's MREFC scope is 76 percent complete. The primary telesco pe building, mirror cell lift, and mirror coating plant construction have been completed . The M1M3 mirror and cell are completed and have been safely transported to the summit. The secondary mirror (M2) has been successfully coated at the summit facility, and staff have b egun moving into the recently completed base facility . Dome installation remains underway despite significant delays . Weather and vendor challenges caused those delays; however, the project has begun planning other activit ies to minimize the impact of delays on the integrated project schedule. The telescope mount assembly successfully completed factory testing in November 2018, and all parts are now on the summit with installation underway. The Auxiliary Telescope, used for calibration purposes, achieved first light on July 24 with commissio ning continuing. NSF - and DOE -supported activities remain tightly coordinated, both at the project level and among agency program officers. Cost and Schedule The FDR panel found the NSF Total Project Cost of $473.0 million to be reasonable and recommended that the project improve their planning of potential descoping options . NSF carri ed out further cost review prior to making the award. The Vera C. Rubin Observatory Project performed a Monte Carlo simulation analysis on its resource- loaded integrated project schedule, as detailed in its project management control system process, and determined a probability of over 90 percent for completing the project for $473.0 million and by the planned survey start date of October 1, 2022. This result was finalized in April 2015 and incorporated into the associated c ooperative support agreemen t. In addition to NSF' s contribution, DOE 's Major Research Equipment and Facilities Construction MREFC - 36 baseline for the camer a was fixed at $168.0 million. Construction also includes approximately $39 million from non- federal sources, all of which ha ve been expended. In FY 2019, GAO performed an analysis, published in GAO- 19-227, which found that the project schedule did not meet all of GAO's best practices and that the schedule was comprehensive and controlled, but that it was only \"partially well -constructed\" and \"partially credible.\" NSF and the Vera C. Rubin O bservatory project have worked to respond to the GAO findings and recommendations, and GAO has now reported (letter to NSF) that they consider the Vera C. Rubin Observatory project schedule to be well -constructed and credible. As of Nov ember 2019, the pr oject had allocated 70 percent of the total budget contingency to the baseline, and $25.10 million remains. One recent change was for a 2.5 -month schedule shift of the baseline project completion date due to vendor delays , reducing schedule contingency to about 3 .5 months. NSF and DOE are work ing closely with the project to monitor and consider remaining descoping and deferral options , to maintain sufficient cost and schedule contingency for proper project management . Risks Technical : Much of the technical risk was retired during development and design. Since full construction began, no new major risks have been identified . Realized risks have been mitigated by use of cost and schedule contingency or re -planning by the Ve ra C. Rubin Observatory Project Office. The Data Management (DM) effort was previously identified as a risk and subsequently re -planned following panel recommendations from the July 2017 DM review, including the release of cost and schedule contingency. Careful planning to stage DM deliverables in coordination with commissioning sequencing will mitigate the remaining risks associated with DM. Commissioning plans overall have pathfinders to mitigate technical risks as the entire system is assembled and integrated over the next two years. Environmental and Cultural Compliance : Environmental and cultural impact mitigation continues as planned with no unforeseen issues. Site: The possible site risk due to local geological anomalies, noted in previous requests, was realized during excavation. Since this risk was localized and anticipated, it was successfully handled. Site disruptions from geological events and extreme weather remain as possible risks with appropriate mitigation plans. Environm ental Health and Safety : The Vera C. Rubin Observatory project has a full -time head of safety with experience in AURA operations, which has a long history of an excellent safety record in Chile. Both the summit and base sites have on -site safety supervisor s employed by the Observatory to monitor contractor and project activities. All safety plans are fully compliant with applicable standards from U.S., Chilean, and participating institutions, and are updated regularly. External reviews have given the projec t high marks for its safety culture. Partnership Risk : Significant attention has been paid to partnership risk, and that risk has been mitigated by careful coordination and unified project structures. The Vera C. Rubin Observatory project director oversee s the entire project. A single project manager, agreed to by both NSF and DOE, manages the complete work breakdown structure elements. Budgetary management details are clearly set out between the project director, the project manager, the project's Change Control Board, AURA 's m anagement council for Vera C. Rubin Observatory construction, and the agenc ies' program officers, grants officers, and financial managers. FY 2021 Budget Request to Congress M REFC - 37 Fut ure Operations Costs NSF plans to provide approximately half of Vera C. Rubin Observator y operations funding, with support currently expected from within the NSF R&RA account. DOE is partnering with NSF on observatory operations and planning activities are in progress. O perations costs are planning estimates based on the most recently availab le data. T he overall 10- year operations cost estimate to NSF remains unchanged at $310.0 million (then- year U.S. dollars). The final full operations costs will be determined through a review, approval, and award process that began with the project's submis sion of a formal proposal for the Vera C. Rubin Observatory operations , including pre - and post -survey activities, in August 2017 with external panel review in December 2017. Operations of the Vera C. Rubin Observatory will be fully integrated into NSF's National Optical -Infrared Astronomy Research Laboratory (the Lab) , which launched at the start of FY 2020. The Lab also encompasses the Mid -Scale Observatories and Community Science & Data Center, which formerly comprised the National Optical Astrono my Observatory, and the Gemini Observatory. For more details, refer to the corresponding section of the Facilities chapter. Although it was originally anticipated that international parties would make financial contributions to the Vera C. Rubin Observatory operations, in FY 2019 NSF and DOE jointly modified the original operations funding model into a new model that seeks in- kind contributions from international participants rather than monetary contributions. Nominally, in- kind contributions are expected to benefit U.S. and Chilean scientists and/or offset NSF and DOE operations costs. The specific nature of these in -kind contributions is currently being formulated and negotiated. NSB is expected to review a request to authorize an operations award in FY 2021, which is anticipated to fund operations beginning in FY 2022. The Vera C.

Office of the Inspector General Amount: $400,000 Purpose : Funds are expected to be used to procure financial and forensic audit services. The selection of awards and institutions to be audited will require careful preparation and is subject to changing circumstances and new information that may require additional time to process. Obligation: Anticipated FY 2020 Quarter 4 Office of Inspector General OIG - 2 OIG Responsibilities and Structure OIG provides independent oversight of NSF's programs and operations. The office promotes effectiveness, efficiency, and economy in administering the Foundation's programs and prevents and detects fraud, waste, and abuse within NSF or by individuals who receive NSF funding. By statute, NSF OIG is organizationally independent from the agency, with the Inspector General (IG) reporting directly to the National Science Board and Congress. Given the geographic breadth of the projects NSF funds, OIG needs to be equipped to conduct audits and investigations across the continental U.S., Alaska, Hawaii, Puerto Rico, and Antarctica. To fulfill its important mission, OIG employs a diverse staff of scientists, attorneys, certified public accountants, criminal investigators, management analysts, data analysts, and information technology specialists. OIG's FY 2019 appropriation was just 0.19 percent of NSF's $8.0 billion appropriation and 0.05 percent of NSF's $33.50 billion portfolio of active awards, yet OIG provides a much greater return on investment and serves as an invaluable safeguard against fraud, waste, abuse, and whistleblower r eprisal. OIG's work is divided into two functional areas: The Office of Audits and the Office of Investigations, which are supported by the Office of Management, Office of Counsel, and the IG's Immediate Office. Highlights of the office's operational impa ct and strategic focus by functional area follow . Audit Impact and Strategic Focus OIG's Office of Audits (OA) conducts audits of NSF's contracts, cooperative agreements, and grants to universities and other research institutions, as well as internal aud its of NSF's programs. These audits help ensure that financial, administrative, and programmatic activities are conducted economically, effectively, and in compliance with applicable regulations. In FYs 2017 through 2019 , OIG audited approximately $7.07 billion in NSF funding in 26 states and Washington, D.C.\u2014 resulting in 72 audit and other engagement reports containing a total of $ 10.0 million in questioned costs and 484 recommendations to recover misspent funds and improve awardee and NSF operations. Fi gure 1 shows the value of the awards audited in each state. In FY 2019, OA identified more than $4.90 million in questioned costs and made 252 recommendations to strengthen program and grant operations. As a result of OIG audits, NSF recouped misspent funds and required awardees to improve their management of NSF awards and subawards to prevent future misuse of taxpayer money. Also, in response to recent audits, NSF strengthened controls over mobile devices, records management, and its large -scale, multi -user research facilities. These improvements increased the effectiveness and efficiency of NSF programs and made NSF a better steward of federal funds. FY 2021 Budget Request to Congress OIG - 3 Figure 1. Audit Coverage October 1, 2016 -September 30, 2019 Areas of Risk for Potential Audit Coverage in FY 2021 Many of the audits OIG performs are required by statute s (the annual financial statement and FISMA audits, audits required by the DATA Act and the Improper Payments Elimination and Reduction Act (IPERA), and a triennial review of the National Science Board's compliance with Sunshine Act requirements) . OIG utilizes a risk -based approach to identify additional issues that would benefit from audit s performed by in- house auditors . While additional areas may emerge by FY 2021, OA has currently identified four such high- risk areas : Divestment of Major Facilities NSF funds the construction, management, and operation of major research facilities, which are shared- use infrastructure acc essible to a broad community of researchers and educators. NSF's major facilities typically have construction costs greater than $70.0 million, with total construction costs ranging from one hundred to several hundred million dollars over a multi -year peri od. Once construction is complete, NSF facilities may operate for 20 to 40 years with annual operations and maintenance budgets ranging between 6 and 10 percent of the original construction cost. With rising costs of operations , NSF needs to ensure it plans for the full lifecycle of the facility including its divestment. The objective of this audit is to determine if NSF identifies, plans for, and manages essential divestment opportunities for major facility projects. Office of Inspector General OIG - 4 Antarctic I nfrastructure M oderniza tion for Sc ience AIMS is one of NSF's most challenging major facility initiatives. According to NSF, the AIMS project will ensure that McMurdo Station remains a viable platform for supporting Antarctic science for the next 35 to 50 years. OA is increasing its monitoring and oversight efforts of the design, construction, and ongoing capital investment and support of AIMS. These efforts will help ensure NSF is properly managing the project and monitoring Leidos' compliance with contract terms . Mid-scale Rese arch Infrastructure Mid-scale project means research instrumentation, equipment, and upgrades to major research facilities or other research infrastructure investments funded between $6.0 million and $ 100.0 million (i.e. exceeds the maximum amount that can be funded by the Maj or Research Instrumentation program but less than a major multi- user research facility project. ) Mid-scale project oversight requirements are tailored to each project's unique characteristics such as the technical scope, the type and mix of work performed and an assessment of the associated technical and programmatic risks. This oversight model could cross multiple divisions and programs within NSF. Regional Class Research Vessel The RCRV project will help modernize the U.S. Academic Research Fleet through the construction of three new research vessels. The not -to-exceed total project costs is $353.97 million over nine years. This project is high risk, which NSF acknowledges. Some of the risks include potential delays or additional costs due to factors such as misunderstanding of requirements and contracting issues. NSF has a time- phased descoping plan to minimize impacts in case contingency funds are not sufficient to cover additional costs. The audi t objectives for this area would be fully developed once we begin background and survey work. Our previous work with large projects has indicated a key risk area occurs during the transition from construction to operations. During this phase , the co -mingli ng of funds intended for operations with funds intended to complete construction ( or vice versa) present the highest risk. Additional areas of risk with any large construction project is the inappropriate use of contingency funds, or risk associated with t he technical failures of the product. Our audits are designed in a way that allows us to evaluate all risks and choose the best approach after the survey phase. Audits of Recipients of NSF Grant Funds Discretionary audits of NSF recipients are an essential part of OA's efforts to protect NSF funds. All statutorily mandated audits and most in -house performance audits focus on NSF's internal operations. Because the bulk of NSF's funding is provided to the academic community via grants and cooperative agreements, robust oversight of that funding is imperative. A udits of NSF recipients determine whether awardees comply with the financial and administrative terms and conditions of the awards. They address the highest risk areas at institutions, identifying systemic issues, recapturing misused funds, and making recommendations ensuring proper stewardship of federal funds going forward. Historically the OIG has procured audits of NSF recipients (which in FYs 2017 -2019 covered between $22.0 million and $44 0.0 million in NSF funding) to provide this much- needed audit coverage over the recipient community. Beyond the findings specific to the institutions being audited, these audits can also identify evidence of behavior that could violate criminal or civil la ws (which would be referred to OIG's Office of Investigations) or of inconsistent treatment of similar charges across the academic community (which can be shared with NSF staff, so they can clarify the issue). The impact of this work is not limited to the entities that are audited: NSF recipients carefully monitor the results of these audits to identify situations where they need to strengthen their own policies and procedures. OA typically uses independent public accounting firms to conduct these audits. A t the Budget Request level, OA will be able to fund 4- 5 FY 2021 Budget Request to Congress OIG - 5 of these audits. OA will also conduct two desk review audits at small to medium sized institutions and continue to monitor the quality of Single Audits. Investigative Impact and Strategic Focus OIG's Office of Investigations (OI) conducts investigations of criminal, civil, and administrative wrongdoing related to NSF programs and operations, including all entities and individuals that receive NSF funds, as well as whistleblower reprisal investiga tions. OI also evaluates and investigates allegations of research misconduct such as data fabrication, data falsification, and plagiarism related to NSF -funded research. Since FY 2009, OIG \u2014civil, criminal, and administrative \u2014have led to fina ncial recoveries and savings to the federal government of more than $87.0 million, including almost $64.0 million in funds returned to NSF. OI's vigilance ensures that those who seek or receive NSF funds to conduct research are held accountable and serves as a meaningful deterrent to grant fraud and research misconduct. OI opens investigations based upon consideration of OIG's strategic goals, NSF Management Challenges, the seriousness and magnitude of the offense, the significance of programmatic vulnerability, and high- risk status of the program or institution. As illustrate d in Figure 2, for FYs 2017 through 2019, OI's investigative oversight of NSF's $33.5 0 billion award portfolio included 492 investigations spanning 49 states, as well as Washington DC, Puerto Rico, and Antarctica . Talent Plan Investigations Recent congressional hearings have focused on the theft of U.S. federally funded research and development by foreign states who use talent plans to exploit the openness of American uni versities and the federal research enterprises. In FY 2018, OI initiated its first criminal investigations focused on potential misuse of NSF funding by members of foreign \"talent plans.\" The volume and complexity of such investigations has increased throu ghout FY 2019, now amounting to a more than 20 percent increase in OI's workload. OI has confronted this national security threat in a number of ways. For instance, in FY 2019, OI hired an analyst with appropriate language qualifications on a term appointm ent to perform immediate, onsite translation of Chinese documents. While China is not the only foreign government exploiting the openness of American universities, many of our investigations concern Chinese talent pl ans. Within one month the analyst saved OIG more than her annual salary in translation costs. Further, her knowledge of the cases and ability to quickly bring matters to the attention of the investigators saved months of investigative time and increased investigation efficiency by an order of ma gnitude. In FY 2020, this position will be made permanent to allow OIG to cost effectively translate the large volume of documents in Mandarin Chinese generated by talent plan related investigations. In addition to the investigations it is working in this area, OI: Founded and now serves as co -leader of a Council of the Inspectors General on Integrity and Efficiency (CIGIE) Working Group designed to inform and assist investigative colleagues with the identification of the threat, predication of cases, and b est practices in conducting such investigations; Collaborates with the FBI and other investigative partners to conduct outreach to internal and external stakeholders (e.g. grantees, institutions) to explain the risks posed by talent plan membership; and Conducts outreach and education to NSF, which has resulted in the issuance of new or amended agency advisories and policies to address the threat, including prohibition of talent plan members serving as employees or Intergovernmental Personal Act (IPA) rotat ors, requiring IPA rotators to be U.S. citizens, and increasing disclosure requirements for researchers seeking NSF funding. OI's investigative work on these cases has resulted in award suspensions and terminations, recovering NSF funds for better use, as well as referrals to the U.S. Attorney's Office. Office of Inspector General OIG - 6 Figure 2. OIG Investigations October 2016 - July 30, 2019 SBIR/STTR Investigations Since 2010, OI has conducted more than 150 investigations related to the Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) and Small Business Technology Transfer (STTR) programs, which remain among the most at -risk programs funded by NSF. With NSF's total annual SBIR/STTR award expenditures now approachin g $200.0 million, protecting SBIR/STTR funds from fraud and abuse has become even more important. OI has successfully partnered with NSF program managers to improve SBIR/STTR processes and procedures to reduce the opportunity for fraud to occur. OI also conducts SBIR/STTR -related outreach at NSF awardee workshops, providing guidance to the small business community on how to properly handle FY 2021 Budget Request to Congress OIG - 7 federal funds and the consequences of not following the rules. OI's efforts have produced significant programmatic impr ovements and enhanced understanding throughout the research community. In addition, OI has led an OIG community working group focused on fraud in these programs to share best practices and lessons learned. Support Offices' Actions and Impacts Office of M anagement OIG's centralized Office of Management (OM) provides support services for the entire office. This includes essential functions such as budget and finance, procurement, human resources and IT services as well as strategic planning and general admi nistrative support. OM develops streamlined processes and uses cutting - edge tools to increase the efficiency and effectiveness of its operations. Specific responsibilities in OM include: Budget and administration \u2014responsible for all budgetary, financial , and administrative business conducted by the office and works with NSF to provide human resources and procurement support. Training \u2014training is scheduled/tracked to ensure staff take all mission -critical and required training . Investigative i ntake operation \u2014all complaints are handled by an I ntake Coordinator, who processes nearly 300 allegations annually. The external OIG Hotline website has been revamped to quickly identify substantive allegations , which the Intake Coordinator presents to Investiga tions management . Forensic accounting and data analytics \u2014an inhouse forensic accountant skilled in data analytics help s manage the large amounts of information that investigators receive through subpoenas and other means. The forensic accountant reduces the need for investigative contract services by over 50 percent, saving $100,000 per year. The application of data analytics to vital functions such as procurement oversight yields further management efficiencies and cost savings. IT services\u2014includ es websit e maintenance and posting of reports, digital forensics, and data security as well as ongoing support of OIG -specific software applications and databases. Digital forensics has become much more critical in investigations, as most of the evidence being capt ured is electronic. Office of Counsel The Office of Counsel ( OC) consists of the Counsel to the IG and two assistant counsels, one of which is part-time. It provides comprehensive legal advice and critical analysis to the IG and all OIG divisions, including legal review of externally issued OIG work products and certai n correspondence. OC handles myriad subject areas, including audit -related support, ethics, appropriations law, acquisitions, information disclosure, privacy, personnel, and IG Act authorities. OC also supports the larger IG community through active partic ipation in CIGIE projects and committees. On average, OC handles more than 150 actions per year, including routine reviews of reports, contracting matters, and other externally focused documents; Freedom of Information requests ; and legal opinions on various matters. OC attorneys also participate in key meetings and decisions , conduct training, and publish legal updates. This level of routine involvement enables the office to identify and address potential legal issues and risk areas before they mature. Immediate Office The Inspector General's immediate office includes the Chief of Staff and Executive Assistant. The Chief of Staff handles all matters relating to external affairs, primarily congressional relations, and public/media contacts. Government -wide Impact Though small relative to many other OIGs, NSF OIG continues to make significant contributions to the Inspector General community and the government at large. For example: NSF's Inspector General has served as the vice chair of CIGIE since 2014, which includes: Office of Inspector General OIG - 8 1. Chairing CIGIE's IG Candidate Panel to help the White House identify strong candidates for vacant Presidentially Appointed Senate- confirmed IG positions; 2. Representing the IG community in a Five -Eyes effort focused on counter -fraud begun by the British government; and 3. Leading CIGIE's Grant Reform Working Group, which provides valuable feedback and insights to OMB staff as they consider grant -related changes. NSF OIG has conducted outreach to the f ederal IG community, provided tra ining to other investigative agencies, and taken the lead to establish and run four IG community working groups to: 1. Prevent fraud within the SBIR/STTR programs; 2. Increase the use of government -wide suspension and debarment as tools to deter and reduce insta nces of fraud, waste and abuse; 3. Foster the next generation of senior investigative leaders within the IG community; and 4. Address emerging threats to U.S. national security through efforts by foreign governments to illegally obtain intellectual property and other research.

Over the past 5 years, the average cost per FTE increased by approximately 20 percent due to cost of living and benefit increases. OIG will also increase its performance awards to non- SES employees by 1 percent in FY 2021. Funding at the requested level would also provide sufficient travel funds for OIG audit a nd investigative staff. We anticipate that those costs will increase by about 20 percent over current levels by FY 2021 due to several factors, including travel to the Antarctic for oversight work associated with the McMurdo modernization, as well as the e xpanding landscape of OIG investigations, as previously described. OIG anticipates increased costs for the contract used to conduct the financial statement, FISMA and DATA Act audits, which is being recompeted in FY 2020. Funding at the requested level w ill be sufficient to cover that cost and to procure several discretionary audits of NSF recipients. Finally, funding at the requested FY 2021 Budget Request to Congress OIG - 9 level will enable OIG to replace IT equipment that is near the end of its useful life and invest in data analytics and com puter forensics software to augment audits and investigations. For these reasons, the Budget requests an increase of $ 2.57 million in FY 2021. Inspector General Reform Act Statement Section 6(g)(1) of the IG Act, 5 U.S.C. app. 3, was amended by the Inspector General Reform Act of 2008 (Pub. L. 110- 409) to require a summary statement concerning OIG's annual budget request. In accordance with this, we submit the following summary: NSF OIG's FY 2021 Budget Request is $17.85 million. The portion for training is $140,000. The portion for operation of the CIGIE is $ 59,000. 1 The portion of the Budget Request for staff training is expected to suffice for all training needs in FY 2021. Becau se CIGIE's annual assessment is based on a percentage of each OIG's appropriation, the portion indicated for this purpose at the Budget Request level will suffice. 1 This is an estimate of CIGIE's annual membership assessment, which is tied to each member OIG's annual appropriation.

The Board consists of 24 presidentially - appointed members plus the Director of NSF as an ex officio member. Representing the broad U.S. scienc e and engineering (S&E) research and education community, the Board serves collectively as an advisory body on S&E issues critical to the Nation. Board members serve six -year terms on staggered appointments and are drawn from industry, academe, non- profit organizations, government, and professional scientific societies representing the breadth of S&E disciplines. They are selected to represent all areas of the Nation National Science Board NSB - 2 based on their eminence in research, education, or public service. The Board currently co nvenes at least four formally scheduled public meetings per year, with additional meetings as needed, to review and approve major NSF awards; provide guidance on new programs; oversee and provide policy direction to NSF; oversee the lifecycle of large faci lities , including conducting site visits ; and address significant S&E -related national policy issues. The Board initiates and conducts studies and reports on a range of policy topics and engages NSF's stakeholders nation -wide . The Board reviews NSF's priorities to ensure progress and consistency along the strategic direction set for NSF and to ensure balance among new investments and core programs. Policy Responsibilities The Board examines issues of importance to the S&E research and education communities, in general, and to NSF, in particular. Topics for exploration are determined through requests from Congress or the President, and as the Board identifies in consultation with the community and NSF management. Recent publications have examined topics such as the skilled technical workforce , mid-scale research infrastructure, operations and maintenance costs for NSF's large facilities, and the rise of China in S&E . Currently, t he NS B is undertaking an effort to set a Vision for NSF for 2030. The Board has several standing committees , and an ad hoc task force on the NSB Vision 2030 project to assist with its responsibilities. The Executive Committee (EC) includes the Director of NSF, who chairs the Committee, and four elected members from the Board , of whom two are the NSB Chair and Vice -Chair . The Board has delegated to this Committee its authority to approve awards in the rare instances when immediate action is requi red between Board meetings. The Committee on Oversight (CO) conducts independent oversight of NSF's operations, processes for risk management, audit plans and results, and processes for complying with laws and regulations; reviews Office of the Inspector General activities and NSF management responses; monitors audits and makes related recommendations to the Board; and oversees the Board's compliance with the Sunshine Act. The Committee on Strategy (CS) provides a forum for developing the Board' s strategic discussions of NSF's budget, programs, organization structure and agency vision; makes recommendations to the Board on annual Budget Requests and quadrennial Strategic Plans; and provides strategic guidance to the Board on NSF's programs. The Committee on National S&E Policy (SEP) oversees development and production of the congressionally- mandated Science and Engineering Indicators (Indicators ) report in collaboration with NSF's National Center for Science and Engineering Statistics (NCSES); he lps ensure that the S&E information and policy resources developed by the NSB are high- quality, policy- relevant, and accessible in order to meet stakeholder needs; and helps fulfill the NSB's charge to provide ongoing information and policy advice to Congr ess and the President on S&E research, education, and workforce issues. The Committee on Awards and Facilities (A&F) addresses strategic issues and recommends policies to the Board related to awards and MREFC projects; makes recommendations to the Board o n awards and facilities; and provides lifecycle oversight on facilities and oversight on awards.

In additio n to providing institutional memory for the Board, the Board Office staff provides both the resources and expertise for coordinating and conducting science and education policy analyses and developing and implementing broad communication and outreach programs. Staff also advise the Board on legal aspects of its policies and activities and provides operational and administrative support that are essential for the Board to fulfill its mission. The Reques t reflects anticipated increases in NSB office staff pay and in performance awards spending in FY 2021. National Science Board NSB - 4 Other Operating Expenses The Staff Development and Training budget line supports various training events such as federal leadership training for mana gement staff, Contracting Officer Representative (COR) training and recertification, and project management training , as well as facilitation services for staff retreats that have a professional development component. The Board's Advisory and Assistance Services budget line includes some of the resources needed to produce reports such as the Congressionally mandated Science and Engineering Indicators . In recent years, the Board has created interactive digital products to facilitate accessibility and use of Indicators data in policy decisions and analysis. Indicators 2018 include d an electronic state data tool that allows for more frequent and timely updates and state one -pagers that highlight select data by state . For Indicators 2020, the Board will update the state data tool and state one -pagers, develop a series of thematic reports, and release The State of U.S. Science and Engineering in January 2020. In FY 2020, t he Board will also produce its Vision 2030, which will provide strate gic guidance to the NSB, NSF and the S&E enterprise over the next 10 years . Other items in the Advisory and Assistance Services line support multi media strateg ies, such as data-driven dynamic graphics, film, and video, to increase awareness and use of the Board's products by stakeholders. This budget line also supports maintenance of an electronic official records management system, which enables compliance with federal records requirements; th e webcasting and archiving of all open Board meetings ; transcription services necessary for compliance with the Government in the Sunshine Act ; and board book management software, which facilitates effective and efficient NSB meetings. The NSB's Travel and Transportation of Persons budget line primarily cover s costs related to Board member travel to NSF headquarters for the Board's four annual meetings and a member -only retreat, for oversight of NSF's large programs and facilities, and for engaging stakeholder s. To inform the NSB Vision 2030 project , for exam ple, the Board organized listening sessions in Washington D .C., Texas, Massachusetts, Missouri , Arizona , and South Dakota to hear from NSF stakeholders about the challenges and opportunities facing the S&E enterprise over the next 10 years . Also supported in this budget line is travel for invited speakers and participants in the NSB 's activities , such as a panel on the future of fundamental S&E research that the Board organized at its February 2019 meeting . The Communications, Supplies, and Equi pment budget line funds communications services and information technology. The FY 2021 Budget Request will support the Board's efforts to strengthen the U.S. S&E enterprise through its policy and information -related activities. Specifically, the Request will support the NSB's continued engagement with stakeholders \u2014including Congress, the Administration, academia, the business community, and the general public \u2014to better understand their diverse needs. In turn, this will help the NSB improve the usefulness of the resources it produces, ensuring that these stakeholders continue to have access to timely, comprehensible, and objective S&E data and policy guidance.

These can include instrumentation networks, observatories, accelerators, telescopes, research vessels, aircraft, and simulators. In addition, scientific utilization of cyber -enabled and geographically dist ributed facilities continues to increase as a result of rapid advances in computer, information, and communication technologies. NSF's investments are coordinated with those of other organizations, federal agencies, and international partners to ensure they are complementary and well - integrated. Planning, operations, and maintenance of major facilities are funded through the R&RA account. Most construction is funded through the MREFC account. In FY 2018, NSF created the position of Chief Officer for Resea rch Facilities in the Office of the Director, to enhance oversight of major facilities throughout their complete lifecycle. The individual in that position serves as the senior agency official whose responsibility is oversight of the development, construct ion, and operations of major facilities across the Foundation, as required by Section 110 of the American Innovation and Competitiveness Act (P.L. 114- 329). The Program Management Improvement and Accountability Act requires an annual NSF portfolio review integrated with an agency Strategic Review. In FY 2019, the NSF Strategic Review evaluated practices in funding NSF's Major Facilities and lessons learned from the FY 2019 lapse in appropriations. One of the two areas of improvement identified was \"[t]he i mplementation of agency- wide practices regarding funding increments that promote financial continuity and stability for the Major Facilities throughout the fiscal year.\" The key outcome of funding- continuity discussions surrounding the Strategic Review was that NSF Major Facilities should have at least three months of funding obligated to execute the NSF mission across any recognized boundaries of funding discontinuity or other potential shortfalls. NSF allocated funds in its FY 2019 spending plan to assist directorates and offices in the implementation of this new agency- wide practice to provide more robust \"continuity of operations\" for its Major Facilities. The Facility Operation Transition activity proposed in the Integrative Activities (IA) section is the second year of a pilot program that reflects NSF's strategic commitment to successful operations and maintenance (O&M) of new major facilities as well as balancing portfolio funding between facilities and investigator research, both of which were emphasized in the NSB's Congressionally requested 2018 report entitled Major Multi -User Research Facilities Facilities - 4 \"Study of Operations and Maintenance Costs for NSF Facilities\" (NSB -2018- 17).1 NSB suggested a more flexible MREFC account as one way to achieve these goals . Owing to the challenges that would be introduced by maintaining separate construction and operations funding in the MREFC account , as well as the desire to maintain MREFC as a self -contained \"capital\" account, the recommended strategic funding is requested in the R&RA account instead. The funds in this activity will be used to (1) partially support initial O&M of new facilities so that the full O&M costs can be gradually absorbed into the managing division or directorate, and (2) partially support divestment of l ower -priority facilities, the full cost of which may significantly impact individual divis ion or directorate funding. A total of $10.0 million is requested in FY 2021 for the Facility Operation Transition activity. Of this amount, $8.0 million will suppor t O&M for NSF facilities that are in the pre -operations phase within the first five years of their operational life\u2014the National Ecological Observatory Network (NEON) , the Daniel K. Inouye Solar Telescope (DKIST) , and the Vera C. Rubin Observatory. This fu nding will be divided among the se three facilities in approximate proportion to their total O&M requirements. The requested amount is less than 10 percent of the O&M costs of these three facilities, so that most of the funding remains the responsibility of the managing directorate s. The Facility Operation Transition funds will assist the research directorates in sustaining the core research needed to take advantage of the new facility capabilities. The remaining $2.0 million for this activity will support investments in facility divestment activities. The distribution of IA support between facilities O&M and divestment will be re -evaluated annually as new facilities come online and lower -priority facilities are remove d from NSF 's portfolio. This program will be reevaluated after FY 2022 to determine whether it should be modified, continued, or ended. This chapter provides descriptions of each major facility supported through the R&RA account and provides funding infor mation by lifecycle phase for each facility. The information presented for each facility follows the overall framework established by NSF for major facility projects. Information on projects under construction and funded through NSF's MREFC account is provided in the MREFC chapter.

FY 202 1 Budget Request to Congress Facilities - 7 ACADEMIC RESEARCH FLEET ( ARF ) $80,000,000 in Millions)Academic Research Fleet Funding 1 FY 2019 Actual obligations include $3.0 million for continuity of operations into FY 2020.FY 2019 Actual1FY 2020 (TBD)FY 2021 RequestChange over FY 2019 Actual The U.S. Academic Research Fleet included 18 vessels in calendar year 2019. The vessels in the ARF range in size, endurance, and capabilities, enabling NSF and other federally - and state -funded scientists to conduct ocean science and technology research with a diverse Fleet capable of operating in coastal and open ocean waters. Funding for the ARF includes investments in ship operations; shipboard scientific support equipment; oceanographic instrumentation and technical services; and submersible support. Funding levels reported here reflect investments by the Division of Ocean Sciences (OCE) within GEO. In addition to operations, OCE has undertaken construction projects based on inter -agency planning and coordination as discussed in the Federal Oceanographic Fleet Status Report 1 published in May 2013. Details on these construction activities are contain ed in the Fleet Modernization section. Actual include $3.0 million for continuity of operations into FY 202 2 Outyear estimates are for planning purposes only. Total Obligations for ARF (Dollars in Millions) FY 2019 Actual1FY 2020 (TBD)FY 2021 RequestESTIMATES2 For information on continuity of operations funding, see the opening narrative of this chapter. The ARF serves as the main platform for the collection of data and testing of hypotheses about the structure and dynamics of the ocean, as well as the development and testing of novel technological instrumentation. Scientists contribute to advances in many areas including climate variability, marine ecosystems, fisheries, and ocean- related natur al hazards, such as tsunamis, through use of these facilities. Participating graduate and undergraduate students interact with scientists and marine technicians, enabling them to gain first -hand exposure to ocean science field research. Increasingly, techn ological innovations allow research conducted at sea to be transmitted via satellite back to the classroom, broadening the educational impact of the vessels. The ARF is financially supported through an interagency partnership, principally with the Office of Naval Research (ONR) and the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA). The operating costs for the Fleet are divided proportionally among the vessel users based on usage over the past several years, including the Ocean Observatories Initiative's use of the Fleet . NSF coordinates with ship -operating and ship- user academic institutions both directly and through the University- National Oceanographic Laboratory System (UNOLS) organizational structure. Funding for scientists using the Fleet is provided by NSF and other federal and state agencies. Within NSF, science is funded through competitive peer -reviewed proposals, most typically funded within OCE and 1 www.nopp.org/wp-content/uploads/2010/03/federal_oceanographic_fleet_status_report.pdf Major Multi -User Research Facilities Facilities - 8 through selected programs in the Division of Earth Sciences , Division of Atmospheric and G eospace Sciences, OPP, and BIO. Approximately 25 percent of OCE proposals request ship time. Not reflected in this number is the science that utilizes samples or data collected on prior cruises, scientists piggy -backing on scheduled cruises to accomplish additional science, international scientists sailing with the ARF , and science funded by other agencies. The FY 20 21 funding level of $74.10 million will support approximately 1750 ship operating days . During FY 2020 the ONR -owned Global Class R/V Revelle will re -enter the Fleet after a one -year mid-life refit and the ONR -owned Global Class R/V Atlantis will enter her mid -life refit period which will have a one - year duration. In addition to being a general purpose resear ch vessel, R/V Atlantis also serves as the support ship for the Deep Submergence Vehicle (DSV) Alvin , which is scheduled to undergo a major refit during the same period R/V Atlantis will be out of service. Addi tional details are included in the Fleet Moder nization section below. Fleet Operations/Management and Oversight Oversight: NSF provides oversight of the ARF through mechanisms defined in cooperative agreements with each ship -operating institution and through a separate cooperative agreement with the UNOLS Office. NSF is the cognizant agency for ship day -rate negotiations for the ARF, regardless of owner. In addition, NSF oversees the Fleet through Business Systems Reviews, site visits, ship inspections, participation at the UNOLS Council , and various c ommittee meetings by NSF P rogram Directors. Several Program Directors within OCE at NSF, at NOAA, and at ONR are involved in the activities and oversight of the A RF. After an in -depth review of the application of rate structures on ARF ship- related activities, NSF and ONR have transitioned the accounting of Fleet activities into a Specialized Service Facility in accordance with OMB's Uniform Gu idance for Federal Awards 2 CFR 200.468. Management: Management of an institution's ship -operating facilities varies with the scale of the operation, but the core responsibility typically resides with the d irector of the institution, the Marine Superintendent (for all aspects of the facility), and the ship's Captain (for at- sea operations). For larger multi- ship-operating institutions, a Chief of Marine Technicians, schedulers, and finance administrators may also be involved in facility management. Reviews: Based on projected science requirements identified in recent reports and workshops, a fleet of vessels supporting ocean science and technological research will be needed far into the future. Documents supporting this need include the Final Recommendations of the Interagency Ocean Policy Task Force2 of July 19, 2010. Two applicable reports by the National Research Council (NRC) include Science at Sea: Meeting Future Oceanographic Goals with a Robust Academic Research Fleet3 published in 2009, and Critical Infrastructure for Ocean Research and Societal Needs in 20304 published in 2011. In coordination with UNOLS and the other federal agencies that invest in ocean research, the Interagency Working Group on Facilities and Infrastructure (IWG -FI) published a Federal Oceanographic Fleet Status Report5 in May 2013, reviewing the status and describing plans for modernizing the Federal Oceanographic Fleet, which includes both the Academic Research Fleet and the survey ships. This repor t was updated in March 2016.6 In January 2015, the National Academy of Sciences Report Sea Change 2015- 2025 Decadal Survey of Ocean Sciences7 identified the U.S. Academic Research Fleet as having \"the closest match between current infrastructure and the decadal science priorit ies\" and emphasized the overall importance of ships in all of the NAS -identified ocean Budget Request to Congress Facilities - 9 science and technology priorities. Ship operations and technical services proposals undergo external review by the research community every five years. Detailed annual r eports describing activities accomplished are provided by the operating institutions and budgets are negotiated yearly since they are dependent on the number of days the ships will be at sea in support of NSF -funded research programs. Fleet Modernization Oversight: The NSF coordinator for Fleet modernization activities is the Program Director for Ship and Submersible Support, within the Integrative Programs Section (IPS) in OCE, with additional IPS staff providing project management assistance as required . Ocean Class Research Vessels: ONR funded the design and construction of two new Ocean Class Research Vessels which have now been fully integrated into the ARF operating schedule. R/V Neil Armstrong operated by the Woods Hole Oceanographic Institution replaced the Global Class R/V Knorr and R/V Sally Ride operated by Scripps Institution of Oceanography replaced Global Class R/V Melville. Regional Class Research Vessel s (RCRV): In March 2012, NSF leadership approved the request to advance the RCRV to the C onceptual Design Review (CDR) phase as a candidate MREFC project. Funds to initiate construction were requested and appropriated in FY 2017 . Keel-laying for the first RCRV , which will be operated by Oregon State University and is named R/V Taani , was completed in November 2018. Keel -laying for the second RCRV , which will be operated by the East Coast Oceanographic Consortium and is named R/V Resolution, was completed in May 2019. The third RCRV is named R/V Gilbert R. Mason and will be operated by the Gulf -Caribean Oceanographic Consortium. Ke el-laying for RV Mason is planned for Spring 2020. The RCRV w ill address requirements across government agencies for research vessels in support of ocean science research as discussed in the Fleet Status Report Upd ate of 2016. For additional information on RCRV please refer to the MREFC chapter. DSV Alvin : The Alvin upgrade project consists of two phases: Phase One, completed in 2014, consisted of a major overhaul of all vehicle systems and incorporation of a new ti tanium personnel sphere, which resulted in continued operation of the submersible at its historic depth rating of 4 ,500 meters. Phase Two, funded in 2018 , with $6.0 million, will enable operations to 6 ,500 meters water depth and thus expand the accessible area of operations for Alvin from approximately 60 percent of the seafloor to more than 95 percent . It will also enable relatively shallow, mid -water work in places where the water depth currently prohi bits operations. The Alvin Upgrade Project Team at Woods Hole Oceanographic Institution is working with the Naval Sea Systems Command to design, fabricate, test, and certify all components necessary to complete the upgrade. The primary long- lead item remai ning in the schedule is the variable ballast system, which will require design, fabrication, testing and certification of new pressure spheres. This system, as well as new foam floatation and other improvements, will be ready for incorporation into Alvin during the overhaul in 2020, concurrent with the mid- life refit of the support ship R/V Atlantis . Renewal/Recompetition/Termination Ships supported by NSF are operated by academic institutions, each having a cooperative agreement with NSF. All ship cooperative agreements were renewed in C Y 2018 using a process including external panel review . All future cooperative agreements for ship operator awards for NSF -owned ships will undergo an open competition every ten years. Awardees are subject to additional oversight measures, including quarterly safety and financial reporting, the use of NSF Business System Reviews, and site visit inspections. In 2018, NSF retired R/V Clifford A. Barnes, operated by the University of Washin gton, which was replaced Major Multi -User Research Facilities Facilities - 10 by the R/V Rachel Carson purchased by the University of Washington. In 2019, NSF extended the planned retirement date of R/V Marcus G. Langseth by one year to September 30, 2021 in order to avoid a hiatus in seismic research opport unities while shifting to a new model of providing access to capabilities comparable to those available via R/V Langseth. The focus of the additional period of operations is on providing opportunities for early career scientists to develop their skills, pa rticularly as Principal Investigators. FY 2021 Budget Request to Congress Facilities - 11 ANTARCTIC FACILITIES AND OPERATIONS (AFO) $190,140,000 -$20,80 -9.9%Antarctic Facilities and Operations Funding 2019 Actual1FY 2020 (TBD)FY 2021 RequestChange over FY 2019 Actual 1 FY 2019 Actual obligations include additional one-time funding to replace the aging pier at Palmer Station and to replace or refurbish other equipment and facilities. Antarctic Facilities OPP provides the infrastructure needed to support U.S. research conducted in Antarctica, including research funded by NSF and by U.S. mission agencies, for year -round work at three U.S. stations, on two research ships, and at a variety of remote field camps. Support to other agencies includes mission- essential satellite communications support at McMurdo Station for the Joint Polar Satellite System (JPSS), and the National Aeronautics and Space Administration's (NASA) Ground Networks for the relay of data. Through a partnership with the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA), NASA, and the European Organization for the Exploitation of Meteorological Satellites, OPP supports the relay of real -time satellite - based weather information that informs global forecasting. In addition, OPP enables important climate monitoring activities for NOAA at the Clean Air Facility at South Pole Station . OPP also provides support for NASA's Long Duration Balloon program that enables research in fields ranging from astrophysics to cosmic radiation to solar astronomy and includes payloads from the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) ; the South Pole Remote Earth Science and Seismological Observatory, the most seismically -quiet station on earth and a key site contributing to U.S. activities associated with the Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty and to U.S. Geological Survey and NSF efforts for global seismic monitoring; and access to sites that are key to precise orbit determinations for optimizing use of the Global Navigation Satellite $224.55 $224.55 Palmer Pier Upgrade 4.00 - - - - - - - Total $190.14 $213.56 $217.63 $221.79 $224.55 $224.55 2 Outyear estimates are for planning purposes only.

Total Obligations for Antarctic Facilities (Dollars in Millions) FY 2019 Actual1FY 2020 (TBD)FY 2021 RequestESTIMATES2 The FY 20 21 Budget Request for Antarctic Facilities is $ 190.14 million . The reduction relative to FY 201 9 is partially due to one -time investment s made in FY 2019 to replace the aging pier at Palmer Station and to replace or refurbis h other equipment and facilities. In FY 2021, funds will provide for station operations and science support at NSF's three Antarctic stations, various near and deep field camps, and two leased research vessels. OPP contracts with a prime contractor for science support, operations, the leasing of res earch vessels, and Major Multi -User Research Facilities F acilities - 12 t he maintenance of the Antarctic stations and related infrastructure in New Zealand and Chile. The contractor is selected through a competitive process. Rotary and fixed -wing aircraft used in support of research are also provided through separate competitively awarded contracts. Other agencies and contractors provide technical support in areas of expertise such as engineering, construction, and communications. Following a major refurbishment program, the U.S. Coast Guard's Polar Star returned to service in 2014 and is expected to continue to conduct annual icebreaking services for the McMurdo Station resupply effort until the Coast Guard completes efforts currently underway to recapitalize the N ation 's polar class icebreakers. Management and Oversight NSF Structure: OPP staff, including subject matter experts in operational and sci entific disciplines, have overall responsibility for managing Antarctic Facilities under the U.S. Antarctic Program (USAP); NSF budgets for and manages USAP on behalf of the Nation. This includes planning all activities and overseeing contractors. OPP's An tarctic Sciences section funds merit -reviewed research proposals for which access to Antarctica is essential to advancing the scientific frontiers and that can only be achieved or are best achieved with research work in/on Antarctica and the Southern Ocean. Research is conducted in a broad array of geo- and bio- sciences, including earth system science, and space and astrophysical sciences. The Antarctic Infrastructure and Logistics section of OPP enables research in Antarctica on behalf of the U.S. government through a network of stations, labs, equipment, and logistical resources. External Structure: The Antarctic prime support contract is currently held by Leidos Innovations Corporation. There are many separate subcontractors for supplies and technical services, and other services are procured through separate competitively -bid contracts. Reviews: OPP evaluates the performance of the Antarctic support contractor annually via an Award Fee Plan, which involves multiple tiers of review, including a Performance Evaluation Board (PEB) composed of representatives from OPP and BFA . In addition, OP P's performance is reviewed externally by Committees of Visitors and the OPP Advisory Committee. The USAP Blue Ribbon Panel (BRP) released a report on its review of the program in July 2012. 1 The initial NSF response to the USAP BRP report was released in March 2013 and progress to address recommendations is ongoing.2 This budge t request includes a request for the third year of funding for the Antarctic Infrastructure Modernization for Science ( AIMS ) project, a major part of the NSF response to the BRP report. Current Status All facilities (stations, research vessels, and field camps) are currently operating normally. The USAP BRP report concluded that ushering in a new age of Antarctic science simply by expanding traditional methods of logistical support would be prohibitively costly. Instead, it recommended numerous ways to mor e efficiently and cost -effectively support research while maintaining high standards of safety and increasing the flexibility to support evolving science foci in the future. For example, construction is underway to upgrade satellite communications systems to support operations and research , and construction activities to replace the Palmer Station pier to ensure 1 www.nsf.gov/od/opp/usap_special_review/usap_brp/rpt/index.jsp 2 www.nsf.gov/od/opp/usap_special_review/usap_brp/rpt/nsf_brp_response.pdf Helicopters provide support to field parties on Mr. Erebus on Ross Island and other remote camps in Antarctica. Credit: Air Center Helicopter s Incorporated. FY 2021 Budget Request to Congress Facilities - 13 long- term access to unique research in the peninsula region will begin in early FY 2022. NSF is also constructing a consolidated Information Techno logy and Communications building. This was phased to ensure continuous functionality as the AIMS project site construction gets underway in FY 2020. The National Science Board authorized NSF to award the AIMS project in FY 2019, with funds appropriated by Congress in that year . Leidos is in the process of complet ing the designs of all construction components . In FY 2021 Leidos will perform further site preparation work , procure construction materials, and begin on- site construction . Construction projects to be initiated will include the core utilities, outside cable plant, and Emergency Operations Center. During FY 2021 construction of the Vehicle Operations Center, lodging, and Central Services building will continue . For additional information on AIMS see the AIMS narrative in the MREFC Chapter . Renewal/Recompetition/Termination In FY 2012, Lockheed Martin Corporation was awarded a 13.5- year contract, consisting of a five -year base period and four option periods, ex ercised based on performance, that total an additional 8.5 years. Leidos Innovations Corporation now holds the contract as it acquired the responsible division of Lockheed Martin in 2016. Contracts for fixed and rotary wing support are managed as assisted acquisitions by the Department of Interior, Office of Aviation Services. In 2019, a five-year contract for helicopter support was awarded to Air Center Helicopters, of Burleson, T exas. A five -year contract for fixed -wing aviation services was recently awar ded to Kenn Borek Air of Calgary, Canada. U.S. policy directs NSF to maintain an active and influential presence in Antarctica, including year - round occupation of South Pole Station and two coastal stations.3 As the scientific forefronts addressed there evolve over time, so do the research emphases at the three stations and the infrastructure needed to support them. 3 www.nsf.gov/geo/opp/ant/memo_6646.jsp Major Multi -User Research Facilities Facilities - 14 ARECIBO (ARECIBO) -84.4% 1 Includes $12.30 million in supplemental appropriation funding for hurricane repairs and $2.03 million for continuity of operations into FY 2020. It excludes $2.69 million of FY 2019 O&M costs obligated in FY 2018.Arecibo Observatory Funding in FY 2019 Actual1FY (TBD)FY 2021 RequestChange over FY 2019 Actual The Arecibo Observatory is a center for multidisciplinary research and education with advanced observational facilities. The observatory's principal facility is one of the world's largest single -dish radio/radar telescopes, a 305 -meter diameter reflector located near the town of Arecibo in western Puerto Rico on approximately 140 acres of U.S. Gover nment -owned land. Arecibo is currently operated and managed by the University of Central Florida (UCF) and subrecipients , Yang Enterprises, Inc. G. M\u00e9ndez (formerly Universidad Metropolitana) , under a cooperative agreement with NSF that began on April 1, 2018. The observatory serves over 350 users annually with a wide range of research and observing instrumentation in passive radio astronomy, solar system radar astronomy, and space and atmosphe ric sciences. A peer -review telescope allocation committee provides merit -based telescope time to users. The committee is common to the three fields, but specific subject matter experts from outside the observatory are consulted for reviews. NSF does not p rovide awards targeted specifically for use of Arecibo, although some Arecibo users are supported through NSF or NASA grants to pursue scientific programs that require use of the facility. For example, NSF awarded $5.80 million in 2018 to Brigham Young Uni versity for the development and deployment of an Advanced Cryogenic L -Band Phased Array Camera for Arecibo (ALPACA). With 40 beams, ALPACA will supersede the successful Arecibo L-band Feed Array (ALFA ) 7-beam receiver installed at Arecibo in 2004, increasi ng the survey speed by a factor of five. On September 20, 2017, Arecibo, along with the entire island of Puerto Rico, was severely impacted by Hurricane Maria. Damages were incurred by the physical infrastructure and the scientific equipment , including a broken 430 MHz line feed and some destroyed panels on the main reflector surface. Basic science operations (planetary radar and radio astronomy) restarted within weeks of the storm, at reduced and degraded performance levels. Funding for Arecibo repairs wa s provided in the Further Additional Supplemental Appropriations for Disaster Relief Requirements Act of 2018 (P.L. 115- 123) totaling $16.30 million. Of the total provided, $14.30 million was identified for Arecibo of which $2.0 million was disbursed in FY 2018, for the most critical immediate concerns including debris cleanup. An award for the remaining $1 2.30 million for more complex repairs was made in FY 2019. The remaining repairs will take up to four years, carefully planned to prioritize the most cri tical structural repairs and to minimize impact to ongoing regular scientific observations. While scientific observations have been ongoing actively since late fall 2017, Arecibo does continue to operate at reduced and degraded performance . For example the overall sensitivity is reduced because the main reflector alignment is not yet complete and the 430 MHz line feed has not yet been repaired . The completion of the remaining repairs should bring Arecibo back to pre-hurricane performance level s.

The current cooperative agreement ends in March 2023. 3 Further Additional Supplemental Appropriations for Disaster Relief Requirements Act of 2018 (P.L. 115-123) provided NSF $16.30 million to repair radio observatory facilities damaged by hurricanes that occurred during 2017. Of the total amount provided, $14.30 million was identified for Arecibo. $2.0 million was obligated in FY 2018, and the remaining $12.30 million was obligated in FY 2019 to fund repairs over a four-year period. Total Obligations for Arecibo (Dollars in Millions) FY 2021 RequestESTIMATES2 1 Includes $530,000 in MPS and $1.50 million in GEO for continuity of operations into FY 2020. It excludes $2.69 million of FY 2019 O&M costs obligated in FY 2018.FY 2019 Actual1FY 2020 (TBD) For information on continuity of operations funding, see the opening narrative of this chapter. Arecibo is jointly supported by the MPS Division of Astronomical Sciences (AST) and the GEO Division of Atmospheric and Geosp ace Sciences (AGS). A n external review of the AST portfolio was completed in 2012, and an external review of the AGS Geospace Section portfolio was completed in 2016. In 2012, the AST Portfolio Review Committee recommended \"continued AST involvement in Ar ecibo be re-evaluated later in the decade in light of the science opportunities and budget forecasts at that time.\"1 The National Academies of Sciences, Engineering, and Medicine 's (the National Academies ') August 2016 report, New Worlds, New Horizons: A Midterm Assessment , reinforced this, with Recommendation 3.1 noting: \"The NSF should proceed with divestment from ground- based facilities that have a lower scientific impact.\"2 The Geospace Section (GS) Portfolio Review Commit tee was charged by the NSF Advisory Committee for Geosciences to review the most promising Geospace science strategies and critical capabilities and to reconcile these with the science goals described by the 2013 Decadal Survey for Solar and Space Physics .3 The GS is in AGS and its portfolio includes grant programs in upper -atmospheric sciences, the near earth space environment, sun -earth interactions, and space weather. This GS portfolio review4 was carried out using the assumption of an inflation- adjust ed, flat budget for GS over the next decade to FY 2026. The GS Portfolio Review Committee recommendations include d the reduction of annual AGS Arecibo funding from $4.10 million to $1.10 million by 2020. GEO commissioned a review from a second panel assembled by the National Academ ies that assessed the process by which the GS Portfolio Review Committee reached its findings and recommendations. The panel published the results of this review5 in early 2017 and, for Arecibo, reiterated the recommendations of the GS Portfolio Review Committee. Alongside scientific community reviews, NSF undertook a comprehensive environmental review of the potential operational changes. This process was formally concluded in November 2017, when NSF published a Record of Decision documenting its choice to collaborate with interested parties to maintain science- focused operations at Arecibo with reduced agency Facilities Facilities - 16 NSF issued a solicitation in January 2017 requesting proposals to provide continued operations and management of Arecibo for five years at reduced funding. The planned NSF funding profile presented in the solicitation gradually tapered NSF support to $2.0 million by the fifth year of the award. In February 2018, NSF announced an award to University of C entral Florida (UCF) to undertake formal transition activities for operations and management responsibilities for Arecibo in a cooperative agreement with NSF . The award continues science- focused operations that will maintain Arecibo's existing research lin es of atmospheric, planetary , and astronomical research and continue its education and public outreach efforts. UCF has ongoing plans to secure partnerships and other funding sources for the operation and management of Arecibo. NSF is supporting UCF in these efforts and in the meantime has maintained steady support for Arecibo, rather than beginning the gradual tapering. The requested FY 2021 budget assumes new partnerships will be obtained, keeping Arecibo's overall budget for operations and management at the level necessary for full scientific operations. Arecibo supplements NSF support with funding provided by other federal and non -federal sources. Since FY 2010, the NASA Near Earth Object Observation Program has committed $2.0 million annually to Arecib o for the planetary radar program; this increased to $3.60 million for FY 2013, with more observing time allocated to the NASA program. In FY 2020 and FY 2021, annual NASA support is expected to be approx imately $ 4.65 million . UCF continues to actively seek other partnerships and funding sources. Education and public outreach continues to be an area of emphasis. Arecibo hosts a Research Experiences for Undergraduates (REU) site, and Ph.D. students receive training through the use of the facility. Over 360 students have participated in REU programs at Arecibo. Arecibo also sponsors a major outreach program in Puerto Rico via the Angel Ramos Foundation Visitor Center as well as summer workshops for K -12 teachers. This center attracts more than 80,000 visitors each year; over 1.5 milli on people have visited since its opening in 1997. Approximately 25 percent of these visitors are K - 12 students. There was a downturn in visitors immediately following the 2017 hurricanes, but as the island recovered the number of visitors began to return to the expected rates each month. Exhibits at the visitor center were updated, and physical renovations to the visitor center building were completed in FY 2016. These improvements were funded by the Angel Ramos Foundation and the Ana G. M\u00e9ndez University S ystem and were formally approved by NSF. With funds received from the Puerto Rico Department of Education, Arecibo has hosted numerous teacher workshops and has trained approximately 500 teachers. This program integrates formal activities at the Angel Ramo s Foundation Visitor Center into the STEM curriculum in Puerto Rico. Arecibo also hosts several meetings each year within a wide variety of scientific disciplines. Operations and Maintenance : Arecibo administers observing time to the astronomy and aeronom y communities via competitive observing proposals and conducts educational and public outreach programs at all levels. Observing hours among science programs are allocated based on the quality of proposals. About 75 percent of astronomy users conduct their observing remotely via networked control software, while radar observations typically employ on- site users.

FY 2021 Budget Request to Congress Facilities - 17 Management and Oversight Funding: AST funding will maintain basic operations costs and science programs in passive radio astronomy. AGS funding will support basic operations costs and science programs in aeronomy and space physics, including space weather . NSF Structure: The lead NSF program officer in AST, in close cooperation with a program officer in AGS , and in consultation with community repr esentatives, provide ongoing oversight. T he program officers make use of detailed annual program plans, long- range plans, quarterly technical and financial reports , and annual reports submitted by the management and operations awardee . They also attend awardee governance committee meetings, as appropriate. To address issues as they arise, program officers work closely with other NSF offices such as the Office of the General Counsel and the Division of Acquisition and Cooperative Support and the Large Facilities Office in BFA . The MPS facilities team and the Chief Officer for Research Facilities, also provide high -level guidance, support, and oversight. AST and AGS program officers conduct periodic site visits and frequent, regular teleconferences with the managing awardee . External Structure: Management is via a cooperative agreement . In February 2018 NSF announced an award to UCF to undertake formal transition activities leading to U CF assumption of full operations and management responsibilities for A recibo. The transition to UCF's management occurred on April 1, 2018. UCF has two sub -awardees: YEI for engineering staff and facilities management and the Universidad Ana G. M\u00e9ndez for management of the visitor's center and the education and public outrea ch efforts. Reviews: In January 2017 , NSF issued a solicitation requesting proposals to provide continued operations and management of Arecibo for five years, but at reduced funding. Proposals received in response to this solicitation were afforded extens ive NSF internal review together with formal review by a panel of external experts in observatory management and operations. Additionally, AST and AGS jointly conduct annual external reviews of Arecibo program plans . The next formal annual external review of UCF's management is scheduled to take place in Spring 2020. Renewal/Recompetition/Termination The current cooperative agreement with UCF for the management of Arecibo was awarded i n April 2018 , when UCF succeeded the previous managing organization. T his followed a competitive process for a new five-year cooperative agreement, consistent with NSB policy. This agreement is in effect through March 2023.

GAGE focus es on studies of Earth's surface deformation at many scales with unprecedented temporal and spatial resolution. GAGE facilities support fundamental research and discovery on continental deformation, plate boundary processes, the earthquake cycle, the geometry and dynamics of magmatic systems, continental groundwater storage, and hydrologic loading. GAGE is managed a nd operated for NSF by UNAVCO, a consortium of 119 U.S. universities and non- profit institutions with research and teaching programs in geophysics and geodesy and 111 associate members from foreign institutions. GAGE was formed in late FY 2013 from the geo detic component of the EarthScope facility and related geodetic facilities previous ly managed by UNAVCO. The FY 2021 Request will enable GAGE to continue to provide key services for the geoscience research community, including global and regional observing networks, field and technical support for experiments worldwide, data management and distribution systems, and other related activities. Over the last three decades, the Earth science research community has greatly refined our ability to determine the position and motion of points on Earth's surface using space geodetic techniques, enabling high- resolution studies of Earth processes in a wide range of fields. Space geodesy applications are extremely broad and expanding to include important societal resear ch on earthquake and tsunami hazards, volcanic eruptions, hurricanes, coastal subsidence, wetlands health, soil moisture, groundwater distribution, and space weather. Applications of geodetic techniques to understand the complex interplay between climate d ynamics, continental ice sheet and mountain glacier dynamics, crustal isostatic adjustments, and sea level change are of foremost relevance to current global issues confronting humanity. $12.00 2 Outyear estimates are for planning purposes only.

For information on continuity of operati ons funding, see the opening narrative of this chapter. FY 202 1 Budget Request to Congress Facilities - 19 To serve the research needs of the broad Earth science community, GAGE is organized under three primary service areas: Geodetic Infrastructure Currently, t he Network of the Americas (NOTA) includes 1,257 continuous Global Positioning System (GPS) and Global Navigation Satellite System (GNSS) stations ( more than 800 of which transmit data in real -time with sub -second latency) distributed across the U.S., Mexico, and the Caribbean , with focus on the active plate boundaries . The FY 2021 Request includes funds to support a network that includes about 1,100 sta tions. The GAGE facility also provides operational and maintenance support for a network of 87 boreho le strainmeters and 79 borehole seismometers deployed along the San Andreas Fault and above the Cascadia subduction zone and volcanic arc. Tiltmeters ( 26) and pore pressure sensors (23) are also collocated with the other borehole instruments. Together, dat a collected by these instruments enable scientists to study the full range of deformation in the solid Earth, from the rapid shaking associated with earthquakes, through more gradual motions related to slow slip events on faults and to Earth's evolving wat er cycles, up to long- term plate tectonics. Global geodetic arrays outside of the NOTA footprint are supported by GAGE in partnership with investigators. Eight hundred continuous GPS stations from over 60 networks around the world are now maintained and monitored, and have their data compiled into the GAGE data system. In addition, GAGE provides operational and maintenance support for 58 National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) -supported stations, and the GNSS network that supports satellite orbit and clock corrections and the refinement of the International Terrestrial Reference Frame (ITRF ). The ITRF is the foundation for high- precision global Earth science and other applications of geodesy such as land surveying . Community GPS /GNSS receiver and geodetic technology pool consists of over 700 GPS and GNSS receivers, ancillary equipment, and six terrestrial laser scanners, which can be used by investigators for short - and long- term deployments on research projects supported via multiple EAR and OPP science programs funded by NSF. GAGE supports the polar GPS network in Antarctica (ANET) and development of specialized GPS monumentation, power, and telemetry solutions for use in harsh environments. GAGE also provides portable campaign deployment geodetic instrumentation, training, and field support for experiments in the polar regions. Investigator Project Support includes project management, field engineering, and technical support services to plan and execute GPS surveys and permanent st ation installations. GAGE also maintains a staff focused on geodetic technology equipment testing services to evaluate new geodetic technologies and improve performance for science applications. Geodetic Data Services Geodetic Data Services manages an archive of over 300 terabytes of data from GPS, terrestrial and airborne laser scanning, Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR), and borehole geophysical instruments from all GAGE components including NOTA, global continuous geodetic networks, and campaign GPS observations; operates automated and manual systems to ensure the quality of all data stored in the archive; and provides systems to give the national and international research community timely access to these data. The archive of SAR imagery maintained and di stributed by GAGE to support interferometric SAR imagery of continuous surface deformation at scales of 100 km to 1,000 km is complementary to discrete GPS measurement of displacement. UNAVCO, as the manager of GAGE, brokers for cost - effective community access to the SAR imagery acquired by foreign SAR satellite systems. In FY 2019, more than 1 5,000 unique users downloaded data from the GAGE archive. These data are used for a wide range of applications, including research , commerce, and education. Major Multi -User Research Facilities Facilities - 20 Educat ion and Community Engagemen t The GAGE Education and Community Engagement program enables audiences beyond geodesists to access and use geodetic data and research for educational purposes, including technical short courses, student internships, web- based m aterials, and programs for strengthening workforce development and improving diversity in the geosciences. Scientific community activities include scientific and technical workshops that bring together the international geodetic community and publications designed to communicate GAGE activities and results to the community. External affairs maintain outreach efforts to policymakers and planning for coordination with the international geodesy community. In addition to its role in providing observational data essential for basic Earth science research, GAGE also plays a significant role providing geodetic infrastructure support to NASA investigators and the international community by maintaining the Global GNSS Network ( GGN) . GGN supports the refinement of the ITRF and corrections to satellite orbits and clocks, all contributing to the capability for millimeter - level geodetic positioning, subtle observations of Earth's time -varying gravity field, and detection of millimeter -level changes in sea level. These capabilities, particular ly precise geodetic positioning , have become essential tool s for civil and commercial activity. Commercial surveyors and engineering firms download GAGE real -time GPS data daily to support precis ion positioning which is now a mainstay of their industry. GPS is also used extensively for terrestrial and marine navigation both commercially and by the general public. Management and Oversight NSF Structure: The Division of Earth Sciences in GEO , through its Instrumentation and Facilities program, provides general oversight of GAGE to assure effective performance and administration. The program also facilitates coordination of GAGE programs and projects with other NSF -supported facilities and projects, and with other federal agencies, and evaluates and reviews the performance of UNAVCO in managing and operating GAGE. In addition, an I ntegrated Project Team consisting of representatives from EAR, Division of Acquisition and Cooperative Support , and the Large Facilit ies Office work with the cognizant program officer in addressing challenges and identifying potential barriers for success. The EAR Division Director and Integrated Activities S ection Head provide other internal oversight. External Structure: GAGE is managed and operated by UNAVCO, which is incorporated as a non-profit consortium representing 119 U.S. universities and non- profit organizations with research and teaching programs that rely on geodetic technologies for Earth Sc ience research. Each voting member institution of the Consortium appoints a member representative, and these member representatives elect the nine members of the UNAVCO Board of Directors, seven of which are drawn from member institutions, and two director s-at-large. The board members, who serve two- year terms, vet all internal program decisions associated with GAGE management and operation, through consultation with UNAVCO staff and GAGE advisory committees (one for each major GAGE component and additional ad hoc working groups appointed for special tasks). The Board of Directors appoints a president of UNAVCO to a renewable two -year term. The president is responsible for UNAVCO operations, all of which are managed through the UNAVCO Corporate Headquarters in Boulder, Colorado. Reviews: In FY 2019, EAR conduct ed a joint review of the data services activities of GAGE and its seismic facility counterpart Seismological Facility for the Advancement of GEoscience (SAGE). FY 202 1 Budget Request to Congress Facilities - 21 Renewal/Recompetition/Termination A su ccessful NSF merit review of the proposal for the GAGE facility took place in 2017 and 2018, and funding for the current GAGE cooperative agreement began in FY 2019 and it will end in FY 2023. In preparation for the next recompetition that will begin in FY 2022, NSF is gathering input through several mechanisms. First, NSF requested the National Academy of Science, Engineering, and Medicine to explore different models to manage geophysical capabilities to serve the Earth Sciences community as one component of the decadal study \" Catalyzing Opportunities for Research in Earth Sciences \"1. The report from the workshop that explored different models can be found at https://www.nap.edu/catalog/25536. Second, NSF is conven ing an interagency working group to identify the needs other agencies have for the capabilities currently provided by SAGE and GAGE. Lastly, NSF will use internal processes to assess facility capabilities. The information from the se activities will be used to draft the solicitation requesting proposals to support geophysical capabilities for Earth Sciences research and education. 1 www8.nationalacademies.org/pa/projectview.aspx?key=51287 Major Multi -User Research Facilities Facilities - 22 ICECUBE NEUTRINO OBSERVATORY (I is the world's first high -energy neutrino1 observatory and is located deep within the ice under the U.S. Amundsen- Scott South Pole Station in Antarctica. With the discovery in 2013 of very high-energy neutrinos from beyond our solar system, the Observatory has demonstrated that it represents a new window on the univ erse, providing unique data on the engines that power active galactic nuclei, the origin of high- energy cosmic rays, the nature of gamma ray bursts, the activities surrounding supermassive black holes, and other violent and energetic astrophysical phenomen a. The energ ies and arrival direction s of neutrinos are derived from the IceCube data stream and the collaboration has recently focused on studies of neutrino events in the medium to high -energy range . The number of high -energy neutrinos detected by IceCube has already exceeded 150 and so will provide a statistically robust basis for determining the flux of neutrino s from beyond our solar system . Approximately one cubic kilometer of ice is instrumented with an array of photo-multiplier (PM) tubes to detect light produced when a neutrino interacts with an atomic nucleus in the ice within or near the instrumented volume of ice . Since completion in 2010, the ICNO has been taking data in its final configuration with an uptime of well over 99 percent. To handle the high data rates, initial analysis of the data is performed by a cluster of computers housed in a two- story building a bove the array. Data produced by this initial analysis are batched and sent via geostationary satellites to the IceCube Research Center at the University of Wisconsin. The Observatory includes a Deep Core Array (DCA) with tightly spaced PM tubes to detect low to medium energy neutrinos , thus opening the door to st udies of neutrino oscillation measurements. The DCA will be upgraded in FY 2023 with seven additional strings of PM tubes under an NSF award issued in FY 2019. This addition will extend the sensitivity of ICNO to a lower energ y range which will provide a bridge to studies of lower energy neutrinos measured by other neutrino observatories such as Super -Kamiokande in Japan . In FY 2013, ICNO observed the first high- energy, astrophysical or cosmic neutrinos - revealing an 1 Neutrinos are now known to exist over a broad range of energ ies described in electron -Volts, or eV ; their e nergy range spans from well below 1 eV to 10 E eV (1 GeV = 109 eV; TeV = 1018 eV). Neutrinos with energies between 100 GeV and 100 TeV are refered to as medium range, and those over 100 TeV are refered to as high -energy neutrinos that generally originate outside the Solar system.

The science collaboration is much broader, currently consisting of abo ut 300 scientists from 27 U.S. institutions and 2 5 institutions in 11 other countries (Belgium, Germany, Sweden, Australia, Canada, Denmark, Japan, New Zealand, South Korea, Switzerland, and the United Kingdom). NSF's foreign partners contribute a pro rata share of operations and maintenance costs based on the number of PhD -level researchers involved . Management and Oversight NSF Structure: Oversight of the ICNO is the join t responsibility of GEO's OPP and MPS's Division of Physics (PHY). Support for operations and maintenance, education and outreach , and research are shared by OPP and PHY, as well as other external organizations and international partners. NSF provides over sight through regular site visits by NSF managers and external reviewers. External Structure: The UW isc management structure for ICNO includes leadership by the project's principal investigator supported by the director of operations and two associate dire ctors (one for science and instrumentation and one for education and outreach). A Collaboration spokesperson is selected by the Collaboration from the cadre of senior scientific leaders for a two -year term, with an option to be renewed once for at most fou r consecutive years. At lower levels, project management includes international collaboration representatives, as well as participation by staff at collaborating U.S. institutions. UW isc has in place an external Scientific Advisory Committee and a Software and Computing Advisory Panel that meet annually and provide written advice to the project. UW isc leadership, including the Chancellor, provides additional awardee -level oversight. Operations Costs Full operations and maintenance in support of scientific research began in FY 2011. The associated costs are and will continue to be shared by the partner funding agencie s, U.S. (NSF) and non- U.S., in proportion to the number of PhD -level researchers involved (currently 79:73, resulting in a cost split of 52:4 8 percent , resepctively ). The current NSF award for operations and maintenance constitutes the bulk of the U.S. contribution to general operation of the facility. In addition, work in support of facility operations is perfo rmed by students, postdocs, and senior researchers who are participating in research using ICNO data . Major Multi -User Research Facilities Facilities - 24 NSF provides research support via grants made in response to proposals that undergo the Foundation's normal merit -review process. A pproximately $4.0 mil lion is provided annually to investigators at U.S. institutions for research on more refined and specific data analyses and data interpretation (theory support) as well as for work on instrumentation upgrades . The general operations of South Pole Station, reported in the Antarctic Facilities and Operations narrative, also contribute to supporting the ICNO . The cost of IceCube operations shown in the table herein includes only those that are project -specific and incremental to general South Pole Station ope rations. The expected operational lifespan of the IceCube Neutrino Observatory is 25 years, beginning in FY 2011. Education and Outreach IceCube provides a vehicle for helping to achieve U.S. and NSF education and outreach goals. Specific outcomes include the education and training of future leaders in astrophysics, including undergraduate students, graduate students, and postdoctoral research associates; K -12 teacher scientific and professional development, including development of new inquiry- based learning materials and use of the South Pole environment to convey the excitement of astrophysics and science generally to K -12 students; increased opportunity for involvement of students in international collaborations; increased diversity in science through partnerships with minority serving institutions; and enhanced public understanding of science through broadcast media and museum exhibits (such as the Adler Planetarium in Chicago, Illinois) based on IceCube science and the South Pole environment. NS F supports evaluation and measurement -based education and outreach programs under separate grants to universities and other organizations that are selected following standard NSF merit review. Renewal/Recompetition/Termination NSF re -competed the ICNO operations and maintenance activity in FY 2016. A new cooperative agreement was issued on April 1, 2016 for 60 months to the University of Wisconsin. The required mid-term review was held in March 2019 ; the external panel of experts found the ICNO managem ent and operations activities to be very effective and recommended continuation for the rest of the current award period. This review also provides an important baselin e of information for consideration in developing plans for the future.

Annual operations and maintenance support for operating the JOIDES Resolution drilling vessel , the most - used IODP platform, represents NSF's primary contribution to the program. The JOIDES Resolution is leased from an offshore drilling contractor under a long -term contract. Due to the long lead- time in planning IODP science expeditions, t he FY 202 1 Request of $ 47.00 million for operations and maintenance of the JOIDES Resolution will support up to four expeditions per year in the ship's calendar year 2022 schedule. The exact number and the complexity of the expeditions will be determined when the f inal FY 2020 NSF Major Multi -User Research Facilities Facilities - 26 operating plan is determined . Another commercial contractor provides down-hole- logging services. Databases and core repositories, preparing scientific publications emerging from JOIDES Resolution IODP expeditions, and management of interna tional program proposal review through the IODP Science Support Office, represent additional NSF IODP science integration costs, made at minimal cost to NSF because of international contributions to the program. NSF also provides support for U.S. scientists to sail on IODP drilling platforms and to participate in IODP advisory panels through an associated program. The annual costs for the associated science integration and science support (not included in the table above) for FY 2021 are projected to be approximately $8.50 million, funded separately through the Division of Ocean Sciences (OCE) . The IODP scientific program emphasizes the following research themes: Climate and Ocean Change: Reading the Past, Informing the Future; Biosphere Frontiers: Deep Life, Biodiversity, and Environmental Forcing of Ecosystems; Earth Connections: Deep Processes and Their Impact on Earth's Surface Environment; and Earth in Motion: Processes and Hazards on Human Time Scales. The umbrella IODP Forum provides a venue for all IODP entities to exchange ideas and views on the scientific progress of the program. In the current IODP, each drillship is governed by independent facility boards, each of which is unique and optimized for their respective drilling platform. In the case of the JOIDES Resolution Facility Board (JRFB), two advisory panels review proposals and provide science and safety advice. A U.S. scientist leads the JFRB, with other members from the scientific community, f unding agencies, and the facility operator. The other IODP platforms use the JRFB advisory panels for drilling proposal review. The importance of scientific ocean drilling is underscored by these remarkable facts\u2014since the inception of the program , scientists from 98 countries have participated, resulting in more than 35,000 publications of which more than 11,000 were peer-reviewed, and more than 700 theses and dissertations. U.S. scientists serve as first authors on about 40 percent of the papers currently being published. U.S. scientists from over 150 universities, government agencies, and industrial research laboratories participate in the program . Sample s and data have been distributed to well over 1,000 additional U.S. scientists. Scientists from these groups propose and participate in IODP cruises, are members of the program's advisory panels and groups, and supply data for planning expeditions and interpretation of drilling results.

Review of scientific progress in broader thematic areas is conducted under the authority of the IODP Forum. Renewal/Recompetition/Termination In FY 2013, to facilitate support for drilling proposal review, advisory panel meeting logistics, and other integrative activities for scientists participating in IODP activities (e.g. , websites), the University of California, San Diego was selected, through a competitive merit -review process , to host the the IODP Science Support Office through award of a five -year (FY 2014\u2014FY 2018) cooperative agreement. In January 2018, following external merit- review of a renewal proposal, NSF award ed a 5-year cooperative agreement for continued su pport of this Office through FY 2023. In FY 2014, through a competitive process, Texas A&M University was selected to be the JOIDES Resolutio n Science O perator (JRSO) under a five -year (FY 2015\u2014FY 2019) cooperative agreement which may be renewed for a second five -year period subject to successful performance. This cooperative agreement contain s language encouraging the awardee to facilitate nov el partnerships involving support of JOIDES Resolution operations between the U.S. scientific drilling community and commercial industry, thereby providing new intellectual opportunities and potential redu ction in overall facility cost. The National Scienc e Board in February 2019 authorized the NSF Director, at her discretion, to enter into a renewa l of the cooperative agreement from October 1, 2019 through September 30, 2024. This renewal is now in place. In FY 2015, to facilitate support for U.S. scienti sts participating on IODP platforms (i.e., salary and travel) and for U.S. IODP education and outreach efforts, a new cooperative agreement was awarded, after external merit -review , to the Lamont -Doherty Earth Observatory (LDEO) of Columbia University for operation of the U.S. Science Support Program for a five -year period (FY 2015\u2014FY 2019).

The LHC is a superconducting particle accelerator, approximately 16.5 miles in circumference, where counter -circulating proton beams can collide with a total energy of up to 14 TeV ( one TeV=1012 electron volts). The collisions occur at four discrete interaction points around the circumference of the accelerator where highly sophisticated detectors measure the characteristics of the debris produced in the proton- proton collisions. The LHC can also collide beams of ions, such as lead. Major \"high luminosity\" upgr ades to the ac celerator and detectors are planned to be installed during a suspension in operation that is planned for 2025-mid-2027. The upgrade s will significantly enhance the performance of the accelerator and the detectors so that they will be able to gather more than ten times the total amount of data collected previously . Detailed information on the upgrades can be found in the High Luminosity LHC (HL -LHC) narrative in the MREFC chapter. More than 45 international funding agencies provide support for scientists to participate in experiments at the LHC. Participating scientists have self-organize d into distinct scientific collaborations to operate each of the detectors at the LHC. U.S. participation in the LHC scientific program is defined by Memoranda of Understanding and supporting agreements among NSF, the Department of Energy ( DOE ), and CERN. CERN is responsible for carrying out the overall LHC program goals of operation and maintenance, planning and leading the implementation of upgrades to the accelerator, detectors, and research infrastructure, and achieving scientific goals. As the host laboratory, CERN is responsible for coordinating international participation in the LHC program . The U nited States, through a partnership between the DOE and NSF, made major contributions to the construction and operation of the A Toroidal LHC ApparatuS (ATLAS) and Compact Muon Solenoid (CMS) detectors , two large general -purpose particle detectors at the LHC . NSF ad ditionally supports operation of the LHCb experiment , a special purpose detector that focuses on studying the properties of elementary particles containing b (or \"bottom\") and anti -b quarks . Researchers funded by NSF and DOE comprise the U.S .-ATL AS and U.S .-CMS collaborations, while the U.S.-LHCb collaboration is supported only by NSF. Currently, about 1,270 U.S. researchers participate in the ATLAS and CM S collaborations, including more than 100 post -doctoral fellows and about 450 students , of whom more than 250 are undergraduates . The U.S. researchers comprise about 25 percent of the total membership of the ATLAS and CMS collaboration s. NSF supports about 20 percent of the U.S. ATLAS and CMS contingent (plus about 30 of the 1,282 members of the LHCb col laboration). LHC data have resulted in major scientific discoveries. Foremost of these was the July 2012 announcement by the ATLAS and CMS collaborations of the discovery of a particle having properties consistent with the long- sought Higgs boson, a predi ction of the Standard Model of particle physics. Its existence was a prediction of the theoretical framework describing the origin of the masses of elementary particles. The experimental confirmation of this theory at the LHC led to the award of the 2013 N obel Prize in physics to Fran\u00e7ois Englert and Peter Higgs. In 2018, the ATLAS and CMS collaborations announced observations of Higgs bosons coupling to pairs of t (or top ) and b (bottom ) quarks. Observing these extremely rare FY 2021 Budget Request to Congress Facilities - 29 process es is a significant milestone for the field of high -energy physics as it allows physicists to test critical parameters of the Higgs mechanism in the St andard Model . The new result s may also provide insight into one of the most puzzling aspects of the Standar d Model: the wide range of masses among fermions, the class of particles that constitute matter and include s quarks and leptons. This analysis relied on the abundant data produced to confirm , with overwhelming statistical significance, that the strengths o f these couplings are consistent with the pre dictions of the Standard M odel. The ATLAS and CMS collaborations continue to search for evidence of new physical phenomena beyond the Standard Model. The overall LHC research program includes searches for part icles predicted by various proposed extensions to the S tandard Model. These searches utilize the Higgs boson as a tool for discovery : investigating how it interacts with itself , searching for its possible coupling to dark matter , and scrutinizing the data for anomalies indicative of unanticipated phenomena . The experimental results to date have helped tighten constraints on different models and possibilities, homing in on the most exciting areas of investigation ahead. Further accumulation of data enables these investigations to be carried out with ever - greater precision as researchers look for small , but statistically significant , deviations of measurements from theoretical predictions. This FY 2021 Request f or the NSF LHC program f unds operation activities by U.S. university- based researchers participating in high energy physics at the LHC. In FY 2017- FY 20 19, LHC operations funding was reduced while planning fo r the high luminosity upgrade was underway. As of FY 2020 , HL-LHC planning will have been completed and construction will begin. The LHC will resume full -time operation in May 2021, followin g a shutdown in 2018 and maintenance and installation of performance enhancements in 2019. The LHC's successor, the HL -LHC, and its concomitant detector upgrades, will be installed during a shutdown planned to run from the beginning of 2025 through $20.50 1 Outyear are for planning purposes only. The current cooperative agreemenst ends December FY 2021 (CMS) and January 2022 (ATLAS).Total Obligations for Millions) FY 2020 (TBD)FY A global cyber -wide LHC Computing G rid or WLCG , is dedicated to LHC data processing, allowing scientists to remotely access and analyze vast data sets. The U.S .-ATLAS and U.S .- CMS collaborations continue to lead the development and exploitation of distributed computing within their respective international collaborative efforts. The WLCG and the Tier 2 computing centers funded by NSF enable the researchers at 92 U.S. universities and five national laboratories to access LHC data and computing resources and thus train students in both state -of-the-art scienc e and computational techniques. The High Energy Physics Advisory Panel, through the May 2014 report of its Particle Physics Project Prioritization Panel , recommended to DOE and NSF that the highest priority strategic goal for the U.S. particle physics research program, within a global context, should be continued support for involvement in the LHC program . Within the scope of supported activities, they recommended including design and development planning for the high luminosity upgrades . These upgrades w ill increase the luminosity , or proton- proton interaction rate, tenfold compared to the LHC's initial operating capabilities. This will necessitate significant enhancements to the detectors to exploit this scient ific opportunity. NSF has been working with the U .S.-ATLAS and U.S. -CMS collaborations to plan for a possible contribution to this upgrade. Supplemental funds provided through the LHC operations award in FY 2016- FY 2018 enabled the U.S. -ATLAS and U.S. -CMS collaborations to prepare and complete their construction- ready planning . Subject to final NSB authorization , NSF plans to begin funding elements of the high luminosity detector Major Multi -User Research Facilities Facilities - 30 upgrades to ATLAS and CMS in FY 2020. Through the participation of young investigators, undergraduate and graduate students, and minority- serving institutions , the U.S. -LHC program serves the goal of helping to produce a diverse, globally- oriented workforce of scientists and engineers. Innovative education and outreach activities allow high school teachers and students to participate in this project. Management and Oversight NSF Structure: A program director in the MPS Division of Physics is responsible for day- to-day project oversight. The Division of Acquisition and Cooperative Support in BFA provides financial and administrative support. An Integrated Project Team, with r epresentatives from MPS, experience d program officers from other directorates within NSF , the Large Facilities Office (LFO) and other divisions in BFA , contribute s to planning and oversight activities. The MPS Facilities team, together with the NSF Chief Officer for Research Facilities, also provide high -level guidance, support, and oversight. External S tructure: U.S. program management occurs through a Joint Oversight Group (JOG), created by NSF and DOE. The JOG has the responsibility to see that the U.S.- LHC program is effectively managed and executed to meet commitments made under the LHC international agreement and its protocols. NSF operations support is provided through cooperative agreements with Princeton University for U .S.-CMS and with Stony Brook University for U .S.-ATLAS. Reviews: NSF and DOE conduct separate and joint external reviews of oper ation and detector upgrade activities . Each agency is fully cognizant of the activities of the other partner. Two joint review meetings per year assess operational performance, scientific and financial status, management issues, and plans for future activi ties. DOE and NSF conducted joint reviews of ATLAS and CMS operations in May 2019. The most recent JOG was held in October 2019. The next major joint review of operations will be held in June 2020 . NSF conducted F inal Design Reviews of the ATLAS and CMS upgrad es in September 2019. In October 2019, NSF conducted external reviews of the budget impacts of the MREFC upgrades on the ATLAS and CMS operations programs. Renewal/Recompetition/Termination Funding for operations and maintenance for the NSF LHC program was renewed in FY 2017 following external review of proposals from ATLAS and CMS. NSF's review process culminated in the implementation of cooperative agreements for operation that will expire in FY 2022. ATLAS and CMS periodically conduct internal competition s among the U .S. universities within each collaboration to select the NSF PI and host institution for the Cooperative Agreement for operation . This process preceded the current award s, and it will be repeated prior to submission of the LHC operations proposal in FY 2022. FY 2021 Budget Request to Congress Facilities LASER INTERFEROMETER GRAVITATIONAL -WAVE $45,000,000 OBSERVATORY (LIGO) -32.6% 1 Includes $10.47 million in additional FY 2019 funding above the requested amount and $11.25 million for continuity of operations into FY 2020.Las er Interferometer Gravitational-Wave Obs ervatory (TBD)FY 2021 RequestChange over FY Einstein's theory of general relativity predicts that cataclysmic processes involving extremely dense objects in the universe, such as the collision and merger of two black holes, will produce gravitational radiation. On Sept ember 14, 2015, NSF's LIGO directly observed gravitational radiation from a black- hole merger, verifying this 100- year-old prediction. This is an achievement of historic importance for fundamental physics, astrophysics, and astronomy, as it opens an entirely new observational window on the universe. This achievement was announced to the world in a series of international press conferences on February 11, 2016. LIGO announced detection of a second black- hole merger on June 15, 2016. In October 2017, LIGO announced the first detection of a neutron star-neutron star merger , observed on August 17, 2017. This event was also ob served in the electromagnetic spectrum, from gamma rays to radio waves, by 70 telescopes around the world. These observations had the far -reaching consequence of confirming that most of the elements heavier than iron were produced by neutron star -neutron s tar mergers . The 2017 Nobel Prize in Physics was awarded to Barry Barish, Kip Thorne, and Rainer Weiss for their \"decisive contributions to the LIGO detector and the observation of gravitational waves.\" In the first two observational periods beginning wi th the September 14, 2015 detection, LIGO detected gravitational waves from 10 stellar -mass binary black hole mergers as well as the one binary neutron star inspiral. During the first observing peri od, or \"run\" (O1), from September 12, 2015 to January 19, 2016, gravitational waves from three binary black hole mergers were detected. The second observing run (O2), which lasted from November 30, 2016, to August 25, 2017, saw a binary neutron star merger and a total of seven binary black hole mergers. The third observing run (O3), which began April 1, 2019 and is ongoing, has detected 33 candidate events as of November 2019 . Of the 33 candidate events, 21 are believed to be binary black hole mergers, two are believed to be binary neutron star mergers , and the origin of the other candidates is less certain. The O 3 run will continue through April 30, 2020. During O3 , LIGO is observing about one detection candidate per week. The European Advanced Virgo interferometer joined NSF's two Advanced LIGO detectors on August 1, 2017, in O2. While the LIGO -Virgo three -detector network was operational for only three and a half weeks, five events were observed in this period. One of these, GW170814, was the first binary black hole merger measured by the three- detector network, enabling the first measurements of gravitational wave polarization and providing an additional confirmation of the theory of general relativity. The Virgo interferometer also contributed to the detection of the binary neutron star merger . Virgo is also participating in the O3 run. All these observations were made while LIGO is still in the process of fine -tuning its instrument ation to reach design sensitivity. The fourth observing run (O4) is planned to begin in 2021, incrementally increasing its sensitivity to reach the full capabilities of the current suite of instrumentation. LIGO, the most sensitive gravitational -wave detector ever built, comprises two main facilities, one in Livingston Parish, LA and one in Hanford, WA. At each facility, an L -shaped vacuum chamber, with two Major Multi -User Research Facilities Facilities - 32 four-km long arms joined at right angles, houses an optical interferometer. The interferometers are used to measure minute relative changes in the distances between the vertex of the L and mirrors at the ends of the arms that are caused by a passing gravitational wave. A pa ssing gravitational wave causes the distance along one arm to lengthen while the other arm shrinks during one half cycle of the wave, and then the first arm shrinks while the other arm lengthens during the second half cycle. The predicted distortion of spa ce caused by a gravitational wave from a likely source is on the order of one part in 1021, meaning that the expected amplitude of the length change over the four-km length is only about 1/1000th the diameter of a proton. LIGO's four -km length was chosen t o make the expected signal as large as possible within terrestr ial and financial constraints: longer arms would result in a bigger signal but would entail larger construction costs. Looking for coincident signals from both interferometers increases LIGO's ability to discriminate between a gravitational wave and local sources of noise. In 2015, LIGO completed installation of the \" Advanced LIGO \" upgrade, funded through the MREFC account . The upgrade enabled the design, fabrication, and installation of an improved apparatus expected to increase LIGO's sensitivity 10 -fold relative to the initial LIGO apparatus (which had operated through 2009) . The Advanced LIGO interferometers operated at about four times the initial LIGO sensitivity during O1, at about six ti mes the initial sensitivity during O2 , and at nine times the in itial sensitivity during O3. The value of obtaining complementary gravitational wave and electromagnetic signals from the same source has already been demonstrated in the enormous scientific i mpact resulting from the observation of a neutron star -neutron star merger. As the number of observations expands with enhanced sensitivity and localization, this will s ignificantly increase our understanding of supernovae and neutron stars. Such scientifi c prospects help motivate the NSF Big Idea ' Windows on the Universe. $45.00 Facility Upgrades - Total $45.00 $45.00 $45.00 $45.00 $45.00 $45.00 2 Outyear funding estimates are for planning purposes only.

LIGO researchers are planning a series of facility upgrades to take place in the coming years. The first of these enhancements, known as Advanced LIGO Plus (or \"A+\"), will significantly increase each interferometer's sensitivity in the mid and upper frequency range of its detection band. This is expected t o lead to a four -fold increase in the detection rate for twin 30- solar -mass black hole coalescences, and nearly a seven -fold increase in the detection rate for the merging of pairs o f 1.4- solar -mass neutron stars. In FY 2018, NSF awarded $10.0 million to LIGO for the A+ enhancement, with an additional $10. 47 million in FY 2019. This award is part of an international effort among NSF, UK Research and Innovation (UKRI) and the Australian Research Council (ARC), who jointly support the U.S.- UK-Australian collaboration of researchers spearheading A+. The A+ upgrades are expected to start operating in 2024. LIGO is pursuing an integrated program of periodic scientific operation of the LIGO observatories, interleaved with engineering studies and upgrades that con tinue to enhance operating performance . The operations budget also supports basic infrastructure maintenance, analysis, and dissemination of data FY 2021 Budget Request to Congress Facilities - 33 obtained from the interferometers, and maintenance of computational resources for data storage and analysis. O perations funding also enables strategic research and development in instrument science that is expected to lead to longer -term enhancements to operational performance. A small part of the operations budget supports education and public outreach (EPO) activities. The LIGO Science Education Center (LIGO SEC), located on the Livingston Observatory site, hosts 50 hands -on inquiry- based learning exhibits and reaches over 15,000 students, teachers and members of the public each year. Its activities ben efit from a partnership with Southern University Baton Rouge (SUBR), the San Francisco Exploratorium, the Baton Rouge Area Foundation (BRAF), and other collaborating educational entities. Trained docents from SUBR assist participants and serve as collegiat e-age role models for young visitors. LIGO SEC programs are supported both through LIGO's operations cooperative agreement and through grants to SUBR and BRAF. The LIGO Hanford Observatory also promotes a highly successful program of outreach to K -12 stude nts and the general public in the Washington State Tri -Cities region, reaching approximately 10,000 people each year. In 2019, LIGO Laboratory received $7.7 0 million from Washington State for the construction of a LIGO Hanford STEM Exploration Center to ca rry out a high- impact, interactive EPO program similar in mission to the LIGO SEC. Detailed facility design and construction planning is now underway. LIGO Laboratory members supported by the operations budget also contribute to many activities of the EPO working group of the LIGO Scientific Collaboration. LIGO fostered a suitable environment to achieve the demanding technical performance requirements needed to detect gravitational waves. Innovations across a diverse range of technologies have led to new techniques with broad applications (for example, preparation of stainless steel for ultra -high vacuum application, adaptive laser beam shaping, and precision dielectric optical coatings). Other technological developments at LIGO have resulted in patents and commercial products (in -vacuum electrical connectors, high power electro- optic modulators). The LIGO Scientific Collaboration (LSC), an open collaboration that organizes the major international groups doing research supportive of LIGO, has 108 collaborat ing institutions in 20 countries with nearly 1,300 participating scientists. The LSC plays a major role in many aspects of the LIGO effort. These include establishing priorities for scientific operation, data analysis and validation of scientific results, and contributing to instrumental improvements at the LIGO facilities and exploring future technologies , as well as fostering education and public outreach programs. NSF supports LSC activities in the U nited States at approximately $8 million per year, whic h is provided through regular disciplinary program funds. Management and Oversight LIGO activities are funded through a five -year cooperative agreement that began October 1, 2018. NSF continually assesses the appropriate level of financial support by mon itoring actual expenditures contained in quarterly activity -based financial reports from LIGO, and through annual external reviews of operations that examine performance relative to objectives defined in LIGO's annual work plans. Infrastructure refurbishme nts recently accomplished , such as repairs and improvements to the vacuum system, as well as further work planned in 2020 will extend the facility life beyond 2030. NSF Structure: NSF oversight is coordinated internally by the LIGO program director in the MPS Division of Physics. The program director consults regularly with representatives from the Large Facilities Office and the NSF Division of Acquisition and Cooper ative Support in BFA . The MPS Facilities team, together with the NSF Chief Officer for Research Facilities, also provide high -level guidance, support, and oversight. External Structure: LIGO is managed by the California Institute of Technology under a cooperative agreement. A subaward from California Institute of Technology to Massachusetts Institute of Technology supports a team of scientists and engineers that are fully integrated into all LIGO activities. The management plan specifies significant involve ment by the user community, represented by the LSC, and collaboration with the other major gravitational -wave detector activities in Asia, Europe, and Major Multi -User Research Facilities Facilities - 34 Australia. External review committees organized by NSF help provide oversight through annual reviews. Recent Reviews: Reviews of observatory operation are held annually. Special purpose reviews using external expert panels have also been held as needed, examining topics such as long -term storage of the interferometer components set aside for possible deployment to India, LIGO computing plans, LIGO ultra -high vacuum system needs, and education and outreach planning. The most recent annual review was held in June 2019 . Renewal/Recompetition/Termination In 2015 and 2016 MPS conducted a detailed consideration of whether to recompete the management of the LIGO Laboratory in conjunction with the current five-year award . As LIGO had just completed installation of the Advanced LIGO apparatus in early 2015, and its operational act ivities were focused on initial commissioning of the apparatus , NSF concluded recompetition was inappropriate. The NSB was apprised of this at their August 9 -10, 2016 meeting , and the award was renewed for the period of October 1, 2018 to September 30, 2023. The 2015 study recommended that NSF, in partnership with the LIGO Scientific Collaboration and with input from the broader astrophysics community, again consider the circumstances and criteria for a possible recompetition midway through the current five -year period (i.e., 2020-21). NSF is currently planning to execute this consideration.

Critical global challenges such as ecological effects of increasing atmospheric carbon dioxide , land- use change, emerging infectious diseases , and invasive species highlight the complexity of key processes that are connected across large spatial scales and play out over decades. As these and other threats arise more frequently and spread rapidly across continents , it is critical to improved unde rstanding of ecological changes that the short- and long- term effects of these phenomena be systematically monitored and assessed , as well as become more predictable through mathematical and statistical modeling. Assessment of ecological processes at a con tinental scale has been hindered by a lack of infrastructure to enable the research required to address complex ecological issues at the necessary spatial and temporal scales. NEON was designed to address this lack of infrastructure and enable vital resear ch. NEON consists of 81 strategically located field sites (47 terrestrial and 34 aquatic) , across 20 eco-climatic domains, with instruments, sensors, cameras, and manual biological and chemical sampling networked into an integrated research platform for re gional - to continental -scale ecological research. The sensor networks, instrumentation, experimental infrastructure, natural history archive facilities, and remote sensing are linked via the internet to computational and analytical capabilities to create NEON's integrated infrastructure. NEON was constructed to revolutionize ecological research and engage the research and education communit ies in the use of open data . In doing so , it provides over 170 standardized data products including meteorological, soil, organismal, biogeochemical, freshwater and remote sensing data for ecosystems at various temporal and spatial scales across the United States over a 30 -year timeframe. Using NEON data, scientists across the U.S. are now able to conduct regional - to continental -scale research projects on the fundamental biological processes underlying invasive species, emerging diseases, changing biogeochemical cycles, land-use changes, climatic variation , and biodiversity , as well as other grand challenges in ecological science. Researchers can also arrange to use the Observatory's infrastructure ( field sites, instrumentation, airborne remote sensing, etc.) for their own studies to advance understanding of ecological processes. Current Status Battelle Memorial Institute (Battelle) is the current awardee for management of NEON. Battelle is a non - profit professional management organization that operates a number of scientific and technical facilities. Construction of NEON was complete d in May 2019.

Management and Oversight NSF Structure The NEON program is managed in BIO, with the Office of the Assistant Director (BIO/OAD) providing policy and programmatic guidance . Oversight resides within the Division of Biological Infrastructure (DBI) and Division of Environmental Biology (DEB). T he NEON Program team within BIO consists of DBI and DEB senior managers, program officers , and a project manager . The Integrated Project Team (IPT) , chaired by the NEON cognizant program officer and which includes representatives from the BFA Large Facilit ies Office (LFO) and the BFA Division of Acquisition and Cooperative Support, with additional participation from the Office of Legislative and Public Affairs, BFA Division of Institution and Award Support -Cost Analysis and Pre -Award Branch, Office o f General Counsel, Office of International Science & Engineering, and the Office of the Director , as necessary, provides guidance and advice in the review and oversight of the project. External Structure In the Spring of 2016, leadership and m anagement of the NEON project was transferred to B attelle , which oversees all aspects of project implementation and coordinates observatory operations. Within Battelle, the observatory director/ chief scientist (OD/CS) provides overall scientific leadership and interfa ces with the science community and other entitie s to support the scientific priorities and operations of NEON . A Science, Technology, and Education Advisory Committee (STEAC), composed of members of the NEON user community , provides oversight and guidance to the project and help s ensure that NEON will enable frontier research and education. The work of the STEAC is complemented by several Technical Working Groups that advise Battelle on the technical aspects of the project. Reviews The construction close -out review in April 2019 document ed the completion of NEON construction scope and transition to operations. External evaluators were tasked with review ing project documentation and confirm delivery of observatory capacity. Reviews of ful l operations and maintenance (O&M) are held annually. The 2019 review of O&M emphasiz ed evaluation of data availability , accessibility, and the facility's cyberinfrastructure . Progress against the annual program plan and towards implementation of review recommendations is also monitored by BIO via biweekly teleconferences, bimonthly operations reports, and site visits as needed. In addition to these scientific and technical reviews, there are periodic review s by organizations within BFA . To evaluate FY 2021 Budget Request to Congress Facilities - 37 the suite of business systems that support the management of NEON, a Business Systems Review was conducted in FY 2019 and included desk reviews of Battelle 's policies , procedures , and technologies as well as site visits to Battelle Headquarters in Columbus, O hio and NEON Headquarters in Boulder, Colorado. Operations Costs Operations and maintenance support began in FY 2014. In August of 2017, a supplemental operations award was authorized . For planning purposes, costs are held constant by BIO at the projected annual operations ceiling of $65.0 million. Community Engagement Battelle's community engagement efforts are led by the OD/CS. The community engagement programs facilitate increased awareness and understanding of ecological change and familiarize people with large, complex datasets. Staff are educating NEON users and the public through a YouTube channel , 1 presentations at local and national meetings, workshops and data institutes, and online learning modules. The data science team is facilitating access to and use of the data with open -source software packages and utilities. BIO and its Advisory Committee have assembled a subcommittee, composed of members of the research community, to evaluate engagement models that will inform a community -based strategy for mobilizing and sustaining NEON users. BIO also engages with other federal stakeholders , including Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency, Department of Energy, Department of Interior (DOI)/ National Invasive Species Council (NISC) , Department of Agriculture (USDA) , DOI National Park Service, USDA Agricultural Research Service , United States Geological Survey , National Aeronautics and Space Administration, National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration , and the Smithsonian Institution . Federal stakeholders are engaged through the NEON Interagency Working Group to help maximize the scientific impact of NEON through coordination when advantageous to the project. Renewal/Recompetition/Termination In July 2019, t he NSF notified NSB of its intention to exercise the option to provide funding to Battelle for a fourth year . Therefore, the current O&M award to Battelle which began in November 2017 now ends in October 2021. Following the notification to NSB , a Dear Colleague Letter was released announcing NSF's intention to openly compete the management of NEON operations and maintenance and encouraging organizations to submit requests for information. The solicitation for the management of NEON operations and maintenance ( NSF 20-530) 2 was released on December 23, 2019.

These unique facilities are available to thousands of users each year and help define and advance science frontiers in many discipl ines through measurements with state-of-the-art resolution and accuracy enabled by the high magnetic fields. Over the last several years, the NHMFL has contributed to major scientific accomplishments in the budding field of topological materials, an entirely new class of quantum materials prominently distinguished by the 2016 Nobel Prize in Physics. Two recent prominent results from the NH MFL include the first confirmation of the existence of a three -dimensional topological insulator state, and the first evidence of a long- sought - for quantum phenomenon known as chiral anomaly in a quantum material. The record -high magnetic fields made available to scientists at the NHMFL enabled an unprecedented and confounding discovery, a phenomenon called re -entrant superconductivity that only exists for magnetic fields above 40 Tesla. A superconducting state arises, breaks down, and then re -emerges in a material under the application of an extremely strong magnetic field. This phenomenon violates current understanding and is likely to reveal unknown facets of superconductivity. NHMFL's MRI at high magnetic field s (21.1 T esla) has enabled in vivo im aging of brain function and FY 202 1 Budget Request to Congress Facilities - 39 cancer research in rats. In April 2017, NHMFL's new 36 Tesla Hybrid magnet reached a performance milestone of ultrahigh stability and homogeneity across the sampling volume. This stability has enabled the world's first nuclear m agnetic resonance spectrum at 1.5 GHz, which opens new probing capabilities for chemists and biologists. In 2016, the NHMFL opened its 21 T esla Ion Cyclotron Resonance (ICR) magnet for user access, allowing enhanced resolution of complex chemical mixture s, such as intact proteins and petroleum crude oil, which have been heretofore intractable for rapid analysis. The ICR magnet impacts a broad array of research areas, such as chemistry, molecular biology, and earth science. A major scientific impact is expected from the research on quantum materials conducted by researchers using the NHMFL magnets. These magnets allow for the exhibition, identification, and visualization of new and unusual quantum effects that lead to deeper understanding of quantum materials and enable the discovery of new ones. Another example of a potential area for advancemen t by NHFML is new imaging techniques for studying the brain. Magnetic resonance imaging and functional magnetic resonance imaging are currently based on imaging proton spin density and intrinsic tissue relaxation rates. With higher magnetic field strengths, NHMFL is investigating other nuclei to use that would result in new insights into mapping the brain and neuroscience. Partnerships and Other Funding Sources: NHMFL collaborates with more than 60 private sector companies as well as a number of national laboratories. These include those supported by the Department of Energy, such as Oak Ridge National Laboratory, which hosts the Spalla tion Neutron Source, and Argonne National Laboratory, which hosts the Advanced Photon Source. Additionally, NHMFL collaborates internationally. The laboratory delivered and commissioned a 26 Tesla series connected hybrid magnet to the Helmholtz - Zentrum Ber lin for neutron scattering experiments. Collaborations also exist with the International Thermonuclear Experimental Reactor in France, and national magnet laboratories in several countries, including the Netherlands , and Germany. NHMFL provides a unique i nterdisciplinary and convergent learning environment. The Center for Integrating Research and Learning at NHMFL conducts education and outreach activities, which include a Research Experience for Undergraduates program, summer programs for teachers, a summ er camp for middle school girls, and activities to raise the scientific awareness of the general public. Outyear funding estimates are for planning purposes only. T he current cooperative agreement ends in December 2022. Total Obligations for NHMFL (Dollars in Millions) 1 Includes $14.20 in DMR funding for continuity of operations into FY 2020 and excludes $9.34 million of FY 2019 O&M obligated in FY 2018. For information on continuity of operations funding, see the opening narrative of this chapter. Management and Oversight NSF Structure: NHMFL is supported by DMR, with the DMR program director as the primary contact for most of the laboratory. CHE s upports the FT -ICR Facility , which is overseen by a CHE program director. The Division of Acquisition and Cooperative Support (DACS) and the Large Facilities Office Major Multi -User Research Facilities Facilities - 40 (LFO) in BFA provide financial and administrative support and t he MPS Facilities team, together with the NSF Chief Officer for Research Facilities, also provide high -level guidance, support, and oversight. External Structure: A consortium of FSU, UF, and LANL operates NHMFL under a cooperative agreement. FSU, as the agreement signatory, is responsible for administrative and financial oversight and for ensuring that lab operations are consistent with the cooperative agreement. The principal investigator, the NHMFL director, reports to the FSU Vice President for Research. Four senior faculty members are co -principal investigators. The NHMFL director receives guidance primarily from the NHMFL executive committee, the NHMFL science council, and the NHMFL diversity committee together with recommendations from an external advisory committee and the users' executive committee. Reviews NSF monitors annual plans and reports including user metrics and conducts monthly teleconferences with the NHMFL director. NSF conducts annual external reviews to assess the user programs, in -house research, long- term plans to contribute significant resear ch developments both nationally and internationally, and operations, maintenance, and new facility development. Annual reviews also assess the status of education, training and outreach, operations and management efficiency, and diversity plans. In addition to these yearly scientific reviews, NHMFL undergoes periodic business systems review s by LFO and DACS . Recent reviews include: Renewal of NHMFL operations award approved by the NSB, August 2017. External Safety Review at all three sites of the NHMFL (July and September 2018). Site visit review with external panel of experts, September 2019. Renewal/Recompetition/Termination In May 2015, NSF determined that it was in the best interest of the U.S. science and engineering enterprise to renew rather than re -compete the NHMFL award. A renewal proposal was submitted in May 2016. In August 2017, the N SB authoriz ed an award to FSU for the operation of NHMFL for 60 months starting in 2018. The current award for the operation of the NHMFL started in January 2018 and will end in December 2022. During 2020, MPS and DMR will assess the status and performance of NHMFL as well as the evolution of high- magnetic -field sci ence to determine the path forward after 2022.

With two linked superconducting cyclotrons, K500 and K1200, it is the leading rare isotope research facility in the U nited States and is a world leader in nuclear physics with the unique capability of producing radioactive beams at energies relevant to nuclear astrophysics. Funding for NSCL also supports the research program of the MSU nuclear science faculty. NSF's stewardship of N SCL will come to a close at the end of FY 2021, when NSCL transition s into D epartment of Energy 's (DOE) Facility for Rare Isotope Beams (FRIB) at MSU . Scientists at NSCL work at the forefront of rare isotope research. They create and study atomic nuclei that cannot be found on Earth and perform experimental research using beams of unstable isotopes to extend our knowledge of new types of nuclei, many of which are important to understanding stellar processes. Research activities include a broad program in nuclear astrophysics studies, the studies of nuclei far from stability using radioactive ion beams, and studies of the nuclear equation of state. NSCL is a leader in the era of multi -messenger astrophysics in that it provides data that is directly related to the origin of th e elements in the Universe and the physical processes that drive quiescent stellar burning, core collapse supernovae and neutron star mergers. In addition, research is carried out in accelerator physics. NSCL scientists employ a range of tools for conducting advanced research in fundamental nuclear science, nuclear astrophysics, and accelerator physics. Applications of research conducted at NSCL benefit society in numerous areas, including studies on the effects of ionizing radiation on DNA, tests of detectors to be used in space missions, development of data acquisition systems and software, and homeland security. The K500 was the first cyclotron to use superconducting magnets, and the K1200 is the highest -energy continuous beam accelerator in the world. Through the Coupled Cyclotron Facility, heavy ions are accelerated by the K500 and then injected into the K1200, enabling the production of rare unstable isotopes at much higher intensities. The laboratory operates an MSU -funded reaccelerator facility (ReA3) that enables experiments at very low energies \u2014a domain of particular interest to nuclear astrophysics. NSCL is the only facility in the world to provide radioactive beams in this energy regime. Nearly on e third of recently proposed experiments will use the ReA3. The mix of experiments is determined by proposals for beam use . An external program advisory committee selects the best proposals at a typical success rate of about 50 percent, with constraints on beam availability. The science output of NSCL is driven by these experiments, with most running five to fifteen days. Undergraduate students reconf igure the MoNA detector for a new experiment.

Funding for NSCL has always had two components: operations and maintenance of the lab and the research activity of the MSU nuclear scientists whose research is based at NSCL. In FY 2019, the operations and maintenance support totaled $18.0 million and research support totaled $6.0 million , with an additional $4.50 million in advance d obligations to partially cover operations costs in FY 2020. The reduction in FY 2021 reflect s the transfer of a portion of the NSCL research support to the MPS Division of Physics (PHY) core program, Nuclear Physics , as part of the planned transfer of NSCL operations and maintenance to the Department of Energy in FY 2022. The FY 2021 Budg et Request reflects an additional reduction of $4.50 million in respons e to prior advanced obligations . NSCL supports and enhances doctorate -level graduate education and post -doctoral research experiences. About 10 percent of all doctorates granted in nuclear physics in the U nited States are based on research at NSCL. The la b also provides research experiences for undergraduate students, K -12 students, and K -12 teachers. In a typical year about 800 users conduct research at NSCL; approximately 70 percent of those users are U.S. scientists. Management and Oversight NSF Structure: MSU operates NSCL under a cooperative agreement with NSF. NSF oversight is provided through annual site visits by the cognizant program officer in PHY and other staff, accompanied by external experts. NSF uses the annual site reviews to assess the user program, operations, maintenance, facility efficiency, national and international research developments, and in- house research programs. The NSF program officer monitors lab operations and plans through monthly phone conferences with the NSCL director. The program officer consults regularly with the NSF Large Facilities Office and the NSF Division of Acquisition and Cooperative Support in BFA . The MPS Facilities team, together with the NSF Chief Officer for Research Facilities, also provide high -level guidance, support, and oversight. External Structure: MSU provides added support for NSCL, which is managed by a director and three associate directors (ex perimental research, education and outreach, and operations) as well as a chief scientist. The director has the authority to appoint associate directors and designate responsibilities, notifying NSF of changes. NSCL's research program is guided by a program a dvisory committee of external experts as well as an in -house expert and the chairperson of the NSCL user group. Opportunities for proposal submission occur once a year and the beam hour backlog is no longer than two years. Optimally the laboratory can provide about 5,000 beam hours to the scientific community each year, with actual output depending upon facility reliability factors and available funds. Reviews: An in -depth review in FY 2016 looked at results and achievements related to intellectual merit an d broader impacts for the prior four years (FY 2012- FY 2015) as well as a review of proposed research, operations, and maintenance funding for the next five years (FY 2017- FY 2021). The most recent annual review took place in August 201 9 and included revie w of NSCL's proposed research program, operations plan for that program, and maintenance plan for the last year of the cooperative FY 2021 Budget Request to Congress Facilities - 43 agreement (FY 2021) . The report expressed overwhelming support for the management and operations of NSCL and endorsed NSCL's plan for the last year of the cooperative agreement . The next review is planned for Summer 2020. Renewal/Recompetition/Termination NSCL currently operat es under a c ooperative agreement with MSU, which is due to expire at the end of FY 2021. After that time , NSCL will transition to the new Facility for Rare Isotope Beams (FRIB) ,1 which is being built by the DOE on the NSCL site. FRIB is scheduled to become operational in FY 2022 and will use much of the NSCL beamlines , instrumentation, and general infrastructure. MSU will be the performing institution under a cooperative agreement with DOE for the future FRIB. To facilitate interagency planning and coordinate the transition from the NSF -funded NSCL to the DOE -funded FRIB, a Joint Oversight Group of DOE and NSF personnel has been meeting regularly since 20 10. DOE and NSF will coordinate transfer of facility stewardship as it transitions from NSCL to FRIB. 1 https://frib.msu.edu/ Major Multi -User Research Facilities Facilities - 44 NATURAL HAZARDS ENGINEERING RESEARCH $10,950,000 INFRASTRUCTURE (NHERI) -$620,000 / -5.4% -$0.62 -5.4% 1 Includes $8.50 million in additional funding to upgrade the LHPOST facility.

NHERI provide s researchers with access to state-of-the-art facilities and tools , unavailable th rough any other agency, to study the performance of civil infrastructure, including buildings, geostructures, and underground structures, in response to individual and combinations of natural hazards. These facilities provide essential research infrastruct ure to support two federally -mandated interagency programs: the National Earthquake Hazards Reduction Program and the National Windstorm Impact Reduction Program. The portfolio of research investigations, which is funded separately through NSF's highly co mpetitive, parallel proposal merit review process, involves large -scale experimentation linked to numerical modeling, and collection and sharing of data to increase the knowledge gleaned from investment in these facilities. Such research is essential to th e development of more comprehensive and more realistic predictive models of how civil infrastructure responds to earthquake s, winds torms such as hurricanes and tornados , storm surge, and tsunami s. These advances, in turn, enable the design of more hazard -resilient civil infrastructure and improve safety for citizens during these events. NHERI includes earthquake and wind engineering experimental facilities; a wave testing facility; a post - disaster, rapid -response research facility; cyberinfrastruct ure; computational modeling and simulation tools; and a research data repository. The research infrastructure investment also supports education and community outreach activities. During FY 2015 and FY 2016, NSF established NHERI through eleven cooperativ e agreements: Network Coordination Office (NCO) at Purdue University, Cyberinfrastructure (CI) at the University of Texas at Austin, Computational Modeling and Simulation Center (SimCenter) at the University of California, Berkeley, Twelve -Fan Wall of Win d at Florida International University, Large -Scale, Multi -Directional, Hybrid Simulation Testing Capabilities at Lehigh University, Large Wave Flume and Directional Wave Basin at Oregon State University, Geotechnical Centrifuges at the University of California, Davis, Large, High- Performance Outdoor Shake Table (LHPOST) at the University of California, San Diego (UCSD) , Boundary Layer Wind Tunnel, Wind Load and Dynamic Flow Simulators, and Pressure Loading Actuators at the University of Florida, Large, Mobi le Dynamic Shakers for Field Testing at the University of Texas at Austin, and Post-Disaster, Rapid -Response Research ( RAPID ) Facility at the University of Washington. The NCO serves as the national and international scientific leader, community focal point, and network-wide coordinator for NHERI governance and community -building activities. Key NCO activities include FY 2021 Budget Request to Congress Facilities - 45 convening the governance groups; working with NHERI PIs to develop consensus -based policies and procedures for NHERI, and the annua l NHERI -wide work plan; implementing the facility scheduling protocol to provide user access to the experimental facilities; leading developm ent of a community science plan; running NHERI -wide education and community outreach programs; and building strateg ic partnerships. NHERI awardees and the natural hazards engineering community work together, through governance and awardee activities, to establish a shared vision for NHERI, set natural hazards engineering research and education agendas and priorities, and make NHERI a highly value -added and productive research infrastructure. Approximately $870,000 is included in the FY 2021 request for NCO activities. The CI awardee serves as the integrator for enabling NHERI to be a virtual organization for the natur al hazards engineering community, by providing an array of information, resources, and services, including the definitive NHERI website; research data repository (Data Depot); software service delivery platform with computational modeling, simulation, and educational tools (Discovery Workspace); collaboration tools; access to high -performance computing resources; and user training and support. The CI awardee also establishes and implements the NHERI -wide cybersecurity plan with all NHERI awardees. The SimC enter develops a portfolio of computational modeling and simulation software and educational modules that reflects a balance of community -prioritized, new capabilities for earthquake, wind, and multi - hazard engineering research and education. The SimCenter 's tools are integrated into the CI awardee's Discovery Workspace. The experimental facilities provide well -maintained and fully- functioning facilities, services, and staffing to enable earthquake engineering, wind engineering, and post -disaster, rapid -response research requiring experimental work and data collection. Data generated by these experimental resources and their users are archived and shared in the publicly accessible NHERI Data Depot. Along with direct operations and maintenance support for N HERI awardees, NSF provides support for research involving NHERI experimental facilities through separate, ongoing research and education programs.

In its upgraded configuration, the LHPOST will be able to reproduce all six components of motion (two horizontal and one vertical translatio nal components, as well as pitch, roll, and yaw rotational components) experienced by the ground during earthquakes. The LHPOST experimental facility will be the only large -capacity facility in the United States capable of performing such tests and has the world's largest payload capacity. Because there are no overhead height restrictions, this facility can accommodate the tallest structures ever tested on any shake table. Major Multi -User Research Facilities Facilities - 46 FY 2019 Operations and Maintenance obligations were lower than in previous years as NSF provided a significant amount of year five funding in the previous fiscal year to ensure continuity of operations. Management and Oversight NSF Structure: NSF oversight is handled by two program officer s in ENG/CMMI working cooperatively with staf f from ENG ; the Office of Budget, Finance , and Award Management (BFA) ; the Office of General Counsel ; the Office of Legislative and Public Affairs ; and the Chief Officer for Research Facilities in NSF's Office of the Director . Within BFA , the Large Facilit ies Office (LFO) provides advice to program staff and assists with agency oversight and assurance. External Structure: Each NHERI awardee is led by a principal investigator (PI), who is responsible for the overall award operations. The NCO awardee coordinates NHERI governance and network activities. Governance is comprised of the following groups: (a) a Council, which consists of the PI of each NHERI award, to provide collective and coordinated leadership for NHERI as a national facility ; (b) Network Indepe ndent Advisory Committee (appointed by the NCO) , with diverse representation from the broad scientific and engineering communities served by NHERI, to provide independent external guidance and advice to the Council ; (c) User Forum, consisting of representa tives from the broad scientific and engineering communities served by NHERI ; and (d) Council -identified committees, comprised of internal awardee staff and/or users, to advise the Council on community priorities and needs for NHERI. Oversight : NSF provide s oversight to NHERI awardees through 11 cooperative agreements . Awardee operations and activities are reviewed through monthly calls with the NHERI Council, quarterly and annual project reports (for the 11 cooperative agreements) submitted by awardees , which include metrics, annual work plans, project usage, and expenditures. In addition, NSF conducts annual reviews of the NCO, CI, SimCenter and RAPID facilities and through periodic site visit and reverse site visit reviews for the seven experimental sites. Studies In FY 2010, NSF supported two studies to assess the need for earthquake engineering experimental and cyberinfrastructure facilities beyond 2014, as described in the Dear Colleague Letter (DCL) NSF 10 - 071. 1 One study, a workshop held by the National Research Cou ncil on Grand Challenges in Earthquake Engineering Research, was completed in FY 2011, and the second study was completed in FY 2012. These studies provided input to NSF for the determination of support for future earthquake engineering research infrastruc ture beyond FY 2014. The plan to support a smaller \"second generation\" Network for Earthquake Engineering Simulation ( NEES ) (NEES2) during FY 2015- 2019 was presented to the National Science Board at their July 2012 meeting and described in DCL NSF 12 -107. 2 The plan 1 www.nsf.gov/pubs/2010/nsf10071/nsf10071.jsp 2 www.nsf.gov/pubs/2012/nsf12107/nsf12107.jsp The above image displays the University of California, San Diego outdoor shake table, which allows large structures to be tested against seismic activity.

FY 2021 Budget Request to Congress Facilities - 47 proposed a lower annual operations budget, reflected in the $8.0 million reduction from FY 2014 in NSF's FY 2015 Budget Request, from $20.0 million to $12.0 million, to allow larger investment in earthquake engineering research using NHERI facil ities. In 2012, the National Institute of Standards and Technology and NSF jointly supported a workshop that led to a roadmap report for measurement science research and development for windstorm and coastal inundation impact reduction, which was publishe d in January 2014.3 In February 2013, NSF released solicitation NSF 13- 537 to compete and operate NEES2 for FY 2015- FY 2019. Based on the merit review of proposals submitted under NSF 13-537, NSF made no award. Based on the above studies and report, NSF established the plan for NHERI in FY 2014. This led to the release of solicitations, NSF 14 -605 and NSF 15-598, to establish 11 NHERI cooperative agreements through two competitions. Those competitions were completed in FY 2016. The 11 a wards for NHERI operations involve commitments for five years, contingent on available funds and satisfactory performance. Renewal/Recompetition/Termination During FY 2019, the NSF Director granted ENG approval to extend NHERI through September 30, 2025, through support of renewal proposals to be submitted during 2020 and 2021 by the 11 NHERI cooperative agreement awardees, pending the outcomes of external merit review and available funds. 3 www.nist.gov/customcf/get_pdf.cfm?pub_id=915541 Major Multi -User Research Facilities Facilities - 48 OCEAN OBSERVATORIES INITIATIVE (OOI) 2019 Actual OOI is a networked observatory that includes deployed ocean instrumentation delivering long- term, time- series ocean data sets for multidisciplinary oceanographic research . All data and metadata are openly available to the public at the OOI website.1 In 2020, the OOI consists of a system of five arrays of instrumented platforms located at critical locations in the ocean and a cyberinfrastructure to deliver the data. The five arrays include: Two Global Arrays: Station Papa Array in the Gulf of Alaska Irminger Sea Array off Greenland. One Regional Cabled Array which supports seafloor and water column instrumentation and platforms on the continental shelf, slope, and in the ocean basin off the coast of Oregon and Washington. Two Coastal Arrays: Endurance Ar ray composed of two lines of moorings, one off the Washington coast and one off the Oregon coast with glider coverage around, along, and between these lines. Pioneer Array composed of a rectangular array of moorings, gliders , and Autonomous Underwater Vehi cles ( AUVs ) deployed on the continental shelf/slope 55 nautical miles south of Martha's Vineyard, MA. Data from the OOI instruments are processed, stored, displayed , and served by the OOI Cyberinfrastructure. Users can view and download raw data and data products through the OOI Data Portal .2 The OOI facility supports user needs to conduct research and education across a wide range of science themes, within an expandable observing infrastructure spanning widely- differing ocean domains. The OOI infrastructure supports scientific instrumentation providing interdisciplinary measurements to investigate a spectrum of phenomena and processes including episodic, short -lived events (meteorological, tectonic, volcanic, geological, geophysical, and ecolog ical), and subtler, long- term changes and emergent phenomena in ocean systems (circulation patterns, climate change, ocean acidification, geophysical events , and ecosystem trends). The overarching scientific themes of the OOI span six multi- disciplinary domains, and each theme incorporates a multitude of research questions. Ocean -Atmosphere Exchange. Quantifying the air -sea exchange of energy and mass, especially during high winds, is critical to providing estimates of energy and gas exchange between the surface and deep ocean, and improving the predictive capability of storm forecasting and climate change models. Climate Variability, Ocean Circulation, and Ecosystems . As both a reservoir and distributor of heat and carbon dioxide, the ocean modifies climate, and is also affected by it. Understanding how climate variability will affect ocean circulation, weather patterns, the ocean's biochemical environment, and marine ecosystems is a compelling driver for multidisciplinary observations. 1 www.oceanobservatories.org 2 www.oceanobservatories.org/data -portal/ FY 20 21 Budget Request to Congress Facilities - 49 Turbulent Mixing and Biophysical Interactions . Mixing occurs over a broad range of scales and plays a major role in transferring energy, materials, and organisms throughout the global ocean. Mixing has a profound influence on primary productivity, plankton community structure, biogeochemical processes (e.g., carbon sequestration) in the surface and the deep ocean, and the transport of material to the deep ocean. Coastal Ocean Dynamics and Ecosystems. Understanding the spatial and temporal complexity of the coastal ocean is a long -standing challenge. Quantifying the interactions between atmospheric and terrestrial forcing, and coupled physical, chemical, and biological processes is critical to elucidating the role of coastal margins in the global carbon cycle and developing strategies for managing coastal resources. Fluid -Rock Interactions and the Subseafloor Biosphere. The oceanic crust contains the largest aquifer on Earth. Thermal circulation and reactivity of seawater -derived fluids modifies the mineralogy of oceanic crust and sediments, leads to the formation of hydrothermal vents that support unique micro- and macro- biological communities , can form economically- important mineral deposits, and concentrates methane to form massive methane gas and methane hy drate reservoirs. The role that transient events (e.g., earthquakes, volcanic eruptions, and slope failures) play in these fluid- rock interactions and in the dynamics of benthic and sub- seafloor microbial communities remain largely unknown. Plate -Scale, Oc ean Geodynamics . Lithospheric movements and interactions at plate boundaries at or beneath the seafloor are responsible for short -term events such as earthquakes, tsunamis, and volcanic eruptions. These tectonically active regions are also host to the densest hydrothermal and biological activity in the ocean basins. The degree to which active plate boundaries influence the ocean from a physical, chemical, and biological perspective are largely unexplored. Current Status The OOI Program Team successfully co mpleted the FY 2019 Annual Work Plan (AWP) and is currently executing the FY 2020 AWP by operating the in- water instrumentation and completing retrieve/replace at - sea operations on an annual basis for the Global Arrays and the Regional Cabled Array, and on a semi - annual basis for the Coastal Arrays. The OOI Team is conducting quality assurance (QA) and quality control (QC) on the ocean data streams and delivering both raw data and processed datasets and data products to the public via the website. During FY 2019, the OOI websit e received a significant level of visits with up to 50 users and 135 pageviews per day, with a high precentage being new visitors. The OOI Program Team has made extensive progress in increasing c ommunity engagement and has develped and is agressively executing a new c ommunity engagment plan, which includes active outreach by the OOI science team to the science community on the QA/QC methods and procedures being used. Operations plans at the FY 20 21 Request level of $43.0 million will be developed in partnership with the awardee and the research community to minimize costs , assess impacts of any proposed de- scope activities, and maximize the scientific return of the $43.00 1 Outyear estimates are for planning purposes only. The current cooperative agreement ends September 2023.Total Obligations for OOI (Dollars in Millions) FY 2019 ActualFY 2020 (TBD)FY 2021 RequestESTIMATES1 After approval of a resolution in May 2018 by the National Science Board, NSF entered into a new cooperative agreement with the Woods Hole Oceanographic Institution (WH OI) for operation and management of the OOI and management responsibilities were transferred from the Consortium for Ocean Major Multi -User Research Facilities Facilities - 50 Leadership to WHOI on October 1, 2018. WHOI has major sub- awardees on the OOI Program Team to operate and maintain the marine infrastructure, manage the scientific data, and ope rate the cyberinfrastructure. The University of Washington operates the OOI Cabled Array. Oregon State University operates the Coastal Endurance Array. W HOI operates the Pioneer Coastal Array as well as the Global Arrays at the two remaining OOI global sites in the Irminger Sea and the Gulf of Alaska , and also serves as the overall Program Management Office (PMO). Management of OOI data is now distributed among the University of Washington, Oregon State University, and WHOI. Rutgers University manages the cyberinfrastructure hardware and WHOI manages the cyberinfrastructure software with support from Raytheon Corporation. Management and Oversight NSF Structure: The Division of Ocean Sciences (OCE) in GEO manages OOI operations located within the Integrative Programs Section (IPS) . The oversight , conducted through a coordinated effort between the IPS Section Head and the Ocean Sciences S ection Head, includes the review of observatory metrics and data quality management, as well as integration of the OOI with any new science or infrastructure proposals and coordination with the science community . Additional NSF oversight of the OOI p rogram is provided by the Integrated Pr oject Team whose core members include the IPS Section Head, the Ocean Science s Section Head , the Facilities Expert in OCE; the liaison from the Large Facilities Offce; the Grants and Agreements Officer from the Cooperative Support Branch ; and a representative from CISE's Office of Advanced Cyber infrastruc ture. External Struc ture: The awardee has a Science Oversight Committee (SOC) that provides input and guidance internally to WHOI for OOI infrastructure planning and management. NSF established the nine-member Ocean Observatories Initiative Facility Board (OOIFB) to provide i nput and guidance to NSF regarding the operation and management of the OOI. The OOIFB is independent of the SOC and held several meetings during FY 2019. Reviews: In October 2019, NSF conducted an External Panel OOI Program Annual Review on- site at WHOI , which was a focused review of the data distribution and cyberinfrastructure and community engagement aspects of the OOI program. Operations Costs The associated costs for Operations and Maintenance (O&M) of OOI infrastructure in support of scientific research have been and will continue to be sole ly supported by OCE. Support for scientific research using observatory data will be through the standard NSF proposal submission process to existing science programs in OCE. Since the data are openl y available over the internet, researchers around the world also have access to the unique data sets that OOI is producing regardless of the source of their support. Education and Outreach The OOI website and cyberinfrastructure provides a portal to enabl e access to information related to the OOI arrays, science themes, marine technologies, lates t research highlights , and live streaming video when available for use in education settings . The internal OOI SOC actively conducts outreach activities regarding the ocean science datasets to researchers, public, and education users. Renewal/Recompetition/Termination The new five -year OOI O&M cooperative agreement with WHOI began on October 1, 2018. In preparation for the next recompetition in FY 2022, NSF will continue to conduct an annual program review and engage with the OOIFB to receive input from the Ocean Sciences community. In addition, NSF will hold a focused mid-award program review in 2021 of the performance of the awardee. The information from these activities will be used to determine whether to proceed with renewal or recompetition .

The Earth's interior remains a major scientific frontier holding the key to understanding the origin of the planet. Recent developments in seismic sensor design and the acquisition, transmission, and storage of data have resulted in dramatic improvements in the resolving power of seismic imaging of the interior of the Earth . To serve the research needs of the broad Earth science community, SAGE is organized under three primary service areas: Instrumentation Services The Global Seismographic Network (GSN) consists of over 150 permanently- installed broadband digital seismic stations, most of which have real -time data access. GS N stations provide critical data for a range of global Earth science research and support key national security needs such as nuclear test-ban treaty verification and natural hazards warning and response. GSN is operated in partnership with the U.S. Geolog ical Survey (USGS). Portable Seismology (PS) includes a pool of over 5,200 portable seismometers that are made available to the E arth science research community for a wide range of principal investigator -driven experiments largely funded through the NSF me rit review process to study a wide range of Earth processes . Major Multi -User Research Facilities Facilities - 52 Polar Support Services supports the development of specialized seismic equipment for use in harsh environments and provides instrumentation, training, and field support for experiments in the pol ar regions. The Transportable Array (TA) is a continental -scale seismic observatory designed to provide a foundation for multi -scale integrated studies of continental lithosphere and deep Earth structure. After operating 1,700 stations in the lower 48 stat es between 2004 and 2015, the full 280 -station TA network is now deployed in Alaska and western Canada. The TA stations collect data for use in studies of natural hazards including earthquakes, volcanoes, and tsunami; the plate tectonic process that have formed Alaska; Earth's magnetic field; and Earth's changing climate. NSF is in the process of transferring adopted stations to other Federal agencies for long- term operations and maintenance . Stations that are not adopted will be decommissioned in FY 2020 and FY 2021. The Magnetotelluric component exploits the natural variations in Earth's magnetic and electric fie lds to provide information on the distribution and composition of fluids in Earth's crust and upper mantle, which gives constraints on Earth's structure that are complementary to those resulting from seismology. Instrumentation Services -Coordinated Activit ies include efforts to develop the next generation of seismic instrumentation for large -scale scientific experiments; global -scale geophysical networks; and training courses to distribute best practices to partners worldwide. Data Services SAGE Data Services (DS) manages an archive of over 540 terabytes of seismic, magnetotelluric, and other data from all SAGE components, the EarthScope program, and numerous affiliated networks; operates automated and manual systems to ensure the quality of all data stored in the archive; and provides systems to give the national and international research community timely access to these data. In FY 2019, more than 22,000 unique users downloaded data from the SAGE archive. These data are used for a wide rang e of applications, including research and education. Education and Public Outreach The SAGE Education and Public Outreach program enables audiences beyond seismologists to access and use seismological data and research, including student internships, and programs for under -resourced educational institutions. In addition to the three services mentioned above, t he capabilities that SAGE provides have extensive societal impacts and supplement existing hazard monitoring efforts by US state and federal agencie s. SAGE provide s key seismic -related infrastructure support to the USGS and National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA). The SAGE Global Seismographic Network is co- funded with support from the USGS and enables earthquake and tsunami hazard warning and monitoring by USGS and NOAA , while also supporting the International Monitoring System that informs the Comprehensive Nuclear Test Ban Treaty Organization. SAGE instrumentation also aids in USGS volcano hazard studies. The magnetotelluric studies enabled by SAGE, which measure electromagnetic fields in the Earth, are being used to mitigate damage to the U .S. power grid associated with potential space weather events. The SAGE facility is used by researchers supported by programs in the Division of E arth Sciences (EAR) and other divisions in GEO ; including Geophysics, Tectonics , Frontier Research in Earth Sciences, GeoPRISMS, Marine Geology and Geophysics Programs , and the Earth Sciences Program and the Glaciology Program in the Antarctic Sciences Section of OPP . For NSF -sponsored research , SAGE supports deployment of portable seismic instruments and use of data managed by DS to solve major Earth science problems. FY 20 21 Budget Request to Congress Facilities - 53 Management and Oversig ht NSF Structure: EAR in GEO , through its Instrumentation & Facilities program, provides general oversight of SAGE to help assure effective performance and administration. The program also facilitates coordination of SAGE programs and projects with other NSF -supported facilities, and with other federal agencies, and evaluates and reviews the performance of IRIS in managing and operating SAGE. In addition, an integrated project team consisting of representatives from EAR, BFA Division of Acquisition and Cooperative Support, and BFA Large Facilit ies Office work with the cognizant program officer in addressing challenges and identifying potential barriers to success. The EAR Division Director and Integrated Activities Section Head provide other internal oversight. External Structure: SAGE is managed and operated by IRIS, which is incorporated as a non- profit consortium representing 125 U.S. universities and non -profit organizations with research and teaching programs in seismology. Each voting member institution of the Consortium appoints a member representative, and these member representatives elect the nine members of the IRIS Board of Directors. The Board members, who serve three -year terms, vet all internal program decisions associated with SAGE management and operation, through consultation with IRIS staff and SAGE advisory committees (one for each major SAGE component and additional ad hoc working groups appointed for special tasks). The Board of Directors appoints a president of IRIS to a renewable two - year term. The president is responsible for IRIS operations, all of which are managed through the IRIS Corporate Office located in Washington, DC. Reviews: In FY 2019 EAR conduct ed a joint review of the data services activities of SAGE and its geodetic facil ity counterpart Geodetic Facility for the Advancement of GEoscience (GAGE) . Renewal/Recompetition/Termination A successful NSF merit review of the proposal for the SAGE facility took place in 2017 and 2018, and funding for the current SAGE cooperative agreement began in FY 2019 and will end in FY 2023. In preparation for the next recompetition that would begin in FY 2022, NSF is gathering input through several mechanisms. First, NSF requested the National Academy of Science, Engineering, and Medicine to explore different models to manage geophysical capabilities needed by the Earth Sciences community as one component of the decadal study \" Catalyzing Opportunities for Research in Earth Sciences \". 1 The report from the workshop that explored di fferent models can be found at https://www.nap.edu/catalog/25536 . Second, NSF is conven ing an interagency working group to identify the needs other agencies have for the capabilities currently provided by SAGE and GAGE. Lastly, NSF will use internal proces ses to assess facility capabilities. The information from these activities will be used to draft the solicitation requesting proposals to support geophysical capabilities for EAR -funded research and education. 1 www8.nationalacademies.org/pa/projectview.aspx?key=51287 Major Multi -User Research Facilities Facilities - 54 FEDERALLY FUNDED RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT CENTERS (FFRDCS) GREEN BANK OBSERVATORY (GBO) $7,300,000 -$2,960,000 / -28.8% $10.26 - $7.30 -$2.96 -28.8% 1 Includes $2.17 million for continuity of operations into FY 2020.Green Bank Observatory Funding (Dollars in Millions) FY 2019 Actual1FY 2020 (TBD)FY 2021 RequestChange over FY 2019 Actual GBO is a major NSF research facility and a Federally Funded Research and Development Center (FFRDC) located in Green Bank, West Virginia . It is operated by Associated Universities, Inc. (AUI) under a cooperative agreement with NSF. GBO enable s leading ground- based research at radio wavelengths by offering access to telescopes, facilities, and advanced instrumentation to the U.S. scientific community, and it conducts an active program of education and public outreach . GBO is also the administrative site of the 13,000- square -mile National Radio Quiet Zone, where all radio transmissions are limited. Having telescopes within this quiet zone allows detection of faint astronomical signals that would otherwise be overwhelmed by anthropogenic radio signals. The main scientific instrument at GBO is the 100-m Robert C. Byrd Green Bank Telescope (GBT), which became fully operational in 2002. The GBT is the world's largest fully steerable single -dish radio telescope, operating at frequencies from 0.2 GHz to 116 GHz. Its large sky coverage, very high sensitivity, and extensive suite of instruments make it a powerful and versatile telescope which enables advances in virtually all areas of modern astrophysics . The GBT offers excellent complementar ity and synerg y with interferometric arrays, such as the Very Large Array, the Very Long Baseline Array, and the Atacama Large Millimeter/submillimeter Array. It also plays a critical supporting role as a highly sensitive element of very long baseline interf erometry, as well as a bistatic radar receiver for rapid and sensitive imaging of near - Earth objects and asteroids. As recommended by the National Academies of Science, Engineering and Medicine's 2010 D ecadal Survey of astronomy and astrophysics, the MP S Division of Astronomical Sciences (AST) conducted a community -based review of its portfolio in 2012. The Portfolio Review Committee recommended divestment of the GBT from AST funding because the strengths of the GBT were less aligned with the scientific priorities of the 2010 D ecadal Survey compared to several other facilities. While affirming the need for divestment, subsequent re views (e.g., the March 2016 and March 2017 reports of the Astronomy and Astrophysics Advisory Committee ,1 and the August 2016 mid- decadal report of the National Academies2) acknowledged the adverse impact of the potential loss of facilities like the GBT on the scientific community and suggested that NSF first consider collaborations with interested partners rather than complete closure of its facilities. NSF's response to this broad community input , starting with the 2012 Portfolio Review, included a multi-year comprehensive environmental review to assess the impact of various divestment options , as well as steps to a llow greater flexibility for exploring cost- efficient operational models and sustainable partnerships for GBO. In July 2019, a fter considering scientific priorities, budgetary constraints, viability of potential partnerships, Request to Congress Facilities - 55 and the results of a compreh ensive environmental review, NSF issued a Record of Decision (ROD) that included continued GBO operations with reduced NSF funding and increas ed partner contributions . Following issuance of the ROD and merit review of a proposal for operations and management of GBO, NSF awarded a new five- year cooperative agreement to AUI for the period FY 2020- FY 2024.

GBO Operations and Maintenance The FY 2021 Request of $7.30 million encompasses support for direct telescope operations at GBO, including maintenance, infrastructure upgrades, and telescope management , as well as funds allocated for education and public outreach. Partnerships and Other Funding Sources In FY 2019, GBO received approximately $4.30 million from other sources, mostly from non -federal partners , including Breakthrough Listen, West Virginia University, and the NSF -funded North American Nanohertz Observatory for Gravitational Waves (NANOGrav) consortium . External (non- NSF) contributions represent ed approximately 35 percent of the total operations budget of GBO. These long- standing partnerships are anticipated to continue over the period FY 2020- FY 2024. Many of the GBO partnerships involve guaranteed allocations of obs erving time on the GBT in exchange for operations funding. Other partnership development efforts are continuing. Management and Oversight NSF Structure: A n AST program officer carries out continuing oversight and assessment for GBO by making use of detai led annual program plans, technical and financial reports, and annual reports submitted to NSF. The AST program officer attends AUI governance and advisory committee meetings. To address issues as they arise, NSF has a n Integrated Project Team for GBO, whi ch includes representatives from other NSF offices, such as the Office of General Counsel, as well as the Division of Acquisition and Cooperative Support and the Large Facilities Office in BFA . The MPS Facilities team, together with the NSF Chief Officer for Research Facilities, also provide high- level guidance. External Structure: Management is through a cooperative agreement with AUI. AUI manages GBO through its own community -based oversight and users committees. The GBO director report s directly to the AUI Vice President for Radio Astronomy. Major Multi -User Research Facilities Facilities - 56 Revi ews: NSF conducts annual reviews of the program operating plan and reports , including external advice from community representatives.

Facility Upgrades : In FY 2018, NSF awarded $2 6.64 million for essential upgrades to NCAR's facilities and programs. This includes a major renovation of the Research Aviation Facility, which is now underway. Partnerships and Other Funding Sources NCAR leverages NSF support with funding provided by other federal agencies and non -federal sources. In FY 2019, NCAR received approximately $49.76 million in support from other federal agencies, including the National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA), the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Major Multi -User Research Facilities Facilities - 58 Administratio n (NOAA), the Department of Energy (DOE), the Department of Defense (DOD), and the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA), and $11.58 million from non- federal sources. This funding supports research collaboration s that directly enhance NCAR's NSF -sponsored research and facilities. Major Investments in FY 202 1 In FY 2021, investments at NCAR will focus on fundamental research aimed at improving our ability to predict atmospheric, chemical, and space weather hazards, and increasing our understanding of the variability in the Earth's climate system at regional and global scales. In all of these areas, NCAR scientists will work with their university colleagues to further understand the fundamental processes that control the Earth's climate and weather systems. T his will include research thrusts in areas such as the role of the chemical composition of the atmosphere, the structure and nature of hurricanes and other severe weather events, and the impacts of processes on the surface of the Sun on space weather and weather on Earth. A continuous process of community prioritization will inform activities undertaken in FY 2021. Advanced Observational Facilities NCAR operates two NSF aircraft: a C -130Q Hercules and a Gulfstream -V, both of which are highly modified and equipped with specialized instrumentation, to enable the support of research activities designed to provide new insights into atmospheric chemical processes, the dynamics and coupling of the atmosphere's layers, and interactions between the atmosphere and Earth's surface. The two aircraft will support community- originated projects deemed by NSF , via separately -managed external peer review , to be of exceptional scientific merit , consistent with the research prioritizatio n mentioned above. In addition to the C -130Q and G -V aircraft, NCAR provides support for a number of other atmospheric and solar observing platforms including specialized Doppler weather radars, lidar systems, upper atmosphere observing capabilities, an ad vanced coronagraph, and other experimental systems. During 2019, NCAR's aircraft and other facilitites supported community field campaigns that studied lightning, in- cloud icing, lake-system high impact weather, surface- atmosphere heat and water exchange, east Pacific tropical convection, and the total solar eclipse. Instrumentation deployed at the NCAR Mauna Loa Solar Observatory monitors the entire solar atmosphere and its critical magnetic environment. These observations are broadly used to improve funda mental understanding of solar activity, space weather , and solar storm characterization, and to better inform forecasts of the latter which can result in the disruption to critical civilian (and military) infrastructure. Petascale Computational Infrastruc ture NCAR (the NCAR -Wyoming Supercomputing Center), that supports high- end community modeling and data analysis programs in atmospheric, solar, and other Earth Systems processes and has over 1,800 unique users. These inc lude the Community Earth System Model , the Weather Research and Forecasting Models (WRF), and the Model for Prediction Across Scales, which use mathematical formulas to simulate and better understand the chemical and physical processes that drive Earth's climate and weather system. NCAR leads the development of these community models and supports many thousands of researchers in the U.S. and worldwide \u2014for example , in 2019, the cumulative number of registered WRF users exceeded 4 8,600, and was growing by an average of 4,100 per year. NCAR also maintains extensive data archives, providing access to a vast collection of observational, experimental, and modeling data, together with sophisticated analysis and visualization facilities, and training and support fo r users of all levels. Research and Education Support As an internationally recognized center of excellence, NCAR operates scientific research programs that include the following areas: studies of large- scale atmospheric and ocean dynamics that contribute to an understanding of the past and present Earth System processes; global and regional atmospheric chemistry, including atmospheric connections to geochemical and FY 20201 Budget Request to Congress Facilities - 59 biogeochemical cycles; the variable nature of the sun and the physics of the corona and the interaction of the solar wind with the Earth's magnetic field; the physics of clouds, thunderstorms, precipitation formation, and their interactions and effects on local and regional weather; and examination of human society's impact on atmospheric compos ition, weather, and climate, and response to global environmental change. Research collaborations with university colleagues are integral to NCAR's success as an institution, and NCAR serves as a focal and meeting point for the broader atmospheric and rel ated sciences community. NCAR also maintains extensive partnerships and collaborations with the private sector through directed research and technology transfer. This work focuses on developing information and analysis platforms tailored to the specific ne eds of stakeholders in a variety of sectors, including energy, aviation, and agriculture. Educational activities include the SOARS (Significant Opportunities in Atmospheric Research and Science) program that integrates research, education, and mentoring t o bridge the undergraduate -to- graduate transition and to broaden participation in the atmospheric and related sciences. NCAR further supports the scientific community by providing fellowships, internships, workshops, and colloquia for students and visiting scientists, and disseminates knowledge of the geosciences. Professional training courses, innovative and award- winning science education websites, as well as the directed activities of NCAR's education and outreach programs, are further examples of how NS F's goal of integrating research and education is attained through NCAR activities. Management and Oversight NSF Structure: NSF's Division of Atmospheric and Geospace Sciences (AGS) within GEO, the Division of Acquisition and Cooperative Support (DACS) , and the Large Facilitities Office (LFO) oversee NCAR and the cooperative agreement under which UCAR manages NCAR. The cooperative agreement encourages interactions between NCAR scientists and AGS staff and ensures close coordination between AGS and NCAR ma nagement. The cooperative agreement contains requirements for AGS's oversight of the NCAR program and UCAR management activities that affect NCAR. UCAR submits for AGS approval an annual program plan for NCAR that details how resources will be used, and an annual report on the previous year's scientific accomplishments and achievements. UCAR also reports annually to NSF on its activities as NCAR's manager. Annual strategic planning by AGS, UCAR, and NCAR ensures that scientific and facility priorities align with those of NSF. External Structure: UCAR works in partnership with NSF and the university community to ensure that NCAR's strategic mission is implemented effectively and for the benefit of NCAR's stakeholders in the atmospheric and geospace sciences. Reviews: A Committee of Visitors (COVs) is convened periodically to evaluate AGS activities, including the oversight of NCAR. The next AGS COV is expected to take place in FY 2020. In FY 2018, as part of the recompetition process (see below), NSF conducted an extensive review of UCAR's financial viability and accounting systems. No significant issues were raised. AGS conduct s periodic co mprehensive review s of NCAR's science programs and facilities, and UCAR's management of NCAR. The most recent review was conducted as a series of site visits to NCAR by teams comprising members of the research community with expertise in the atmospheric and related sciences and in the management of scientifi c centers and facilities. The site visit teams found that NCAR continues to be a world- leading research center, providing essential services and capabilities that foster excellence throughout the atmospheric and geospace sciences community. Major Multi -User Research Facilities Facilities - 60 Renewal/Recom petition/Termination The cooperative agreement for t he management and operation of NCAR was recently recompeted. Following an extensive and robust proposal review process, a new award was made to UCAR. This award began on October 1, 2018, and is for five years, extendable for a further five years subje ct to satisfactory performance. The decision on whether to extend the award will be based upon the outcome of a comprehensive review of NCAR's science programs and management that is expected to be held at approximately the mid -point of the award, during FY 2021.

FY 202 1 Budget Request to Congress Facilities - 61 NATIONAL RADIO ASTRONOMY OBSERVATORY (NRAO) $88,130,000 -$6,910,000 / -7.3% -7.3% 2 Includes $8.09 million for continuity of operations into FY 2020.1 This table aggregates the request NRAO and ALMA base operations.National Radio Astronomy Observatory Funding1 (Dollars in Millions) FY 2019 over FY 2019 NRAO conceives, designs, builds, operates, and maintains state -of-the-art radio telescopes used by scientists from around the world. Operating synergistically with optical, infrared, x- ray, gamma -ray, and gravitational wave telescopes, NRAO facilities enable discovery over a remarkably broad range of key problems in modern astrophysics that reach from within our solar system to the most distant galaxies in the universe. Using NRAO observing capabilities and data archives, scientists: carry out precision cosmological measurements; test fundamental physics; probe deep into the earliest, most intense, and optically obscured phases of planet , star, galaxy, and black hole formation; reveal the cool gas from which stars form; provide essential tools for studying magnetic fields and high- energy cosmic phenomena; and seek to detect the sources of gravitational waves. As a Federally Funded Resear ch and Development Center headquartered in Charlottesville, Virginia, NRAO operates the Karl G. Jansky Very Large Array (VLA) near Socorro, New Mexico ; the Very Long Baseline Array (VLBA), with 10 sites throughout the c ontinental U nited States, Hawaii, and the U .S. Virgin Islands; and is the North American implementing organization for the international Atacama Large Millimeter/submillimeter Array (ALMA) in Chile . In support of these radio telescopes, NRAO also operates the Central Development La boratory (CDL) in Charlottesville, which develops next -generation electronics and detectors for radio astronomy. These observing facilities for radio astronomy are available to any qualified researcher, regardless of affiliation or nationality, on the basi s of scientific, merit -reviewed proposals. In addition to conducting NSF-funded astrophysical observations, t he VLBA is used for fundamental support of the International Celestial Reference Frame, under an agreement with the United States Naval Observatory (USNO). NRAO facilities annually serve over 2,500 users worldwide; moreover, continued high demand for ALMA has resulted in the most proposals ever received for an astronomical facility in response to a single proposal call. NRAO facilities have enabled a remarkable array of ground -breaking discoveries in the last year alone, ranging from imaging storms on Jupiter to radio detections of merging neutron stars, which are multi - messenger events. The most impressive scientific result, fundamentally enabled by the inclusion of ALMA as a cornerstone of the Event Horizon Telescope effort, was the direct imaging of a black hole event horizon. This result is already seen as one of the great scientific achievements of the century, and would not have been possible wi thout utilization of ALMA and the close collaborative effort between the United States, international communities, and NRAO. The VLA and ALMA produced a stream of ground- breaking results in the fields of star and planet formation and astrochemistry over the last year. For example, the combination of high- resolution ALMA dust imaging and Very Large Telescope imaging of the ionized gas in the protoplanetary system, PDS 70, has shown evidence for accretion onto planets themselves, for the first time. The CDL h as continued to excel in its mission to support the evolution of NRAO facilities by developing the technologies and expertise critical for the next generation of radio astronomy instrumentation.

FY 2021 reflects the l evel of the National Solar Observatory budget commensurate with requirements to operate the Daniel K. Inouye Solar Telescope (DKIST) , the construction of which is scheduled to be completed in June 2020. The FY 2021 Budget Request funds both the DKIST operations requirement (science operations and data center) and the NSO Integrated Synoptic Program (NISP) . As a Federally Funded Research and Development Center, NSO is headquartered on the campus of the University of Colorado, Boulder and provides leadership to the solar ast ronomy community through management of the construction of DKIST as well as its subsequent operation once completed as planned in FY 2020. When comple ted, DKIST will be the world's most powe rful solar observatory, poised to answer fundamental questions in solar physics by providing transformative improvements over current ground- based facilities. DKIST will enable the study of magnetic phenomena in the solar photosphere, chromosphere, and corona. Determining the role of magnetic fields in the outer regions of the Sun is crucial to understanding the solar dynamo, solar variability, and solar activity including flares and coronal mass ejections. Solar activity can affect civil life on Earth through phenomena generally described as space weather and may impact the terrestrial climate. The relevance of DKIST's science drivers was reaffirmed by the National Academy of Sciences 2010 Astronomy and Astrophysics Decadal Survey: New Worlds, New Horizons1 as well as the 2012 Solar and Space Physics Decadal Survey: A Sc ience for a Technological Society .2 In FY 2020, DKIST achieved first sunlight through the entire optical system , with data collected by the first of its instruments installed, the Visible Broadband Imager (VBI). NSO also operates the NISP program, which consists of the Global Oscillations Network Group (GONG) and the Synoptic Optical Long- term Investigations of t he Sun (SOLIS). GONG is a coordinated worldwide network of six telescopes specifically designed to study solar oscillations and, more recently, to provide critical data products for the prediction of space weather . NSO routinely provides detailed synoptic solar data from the NISP program used by individual researchers and other government agencies through the NSO Digital Library. NSO data are also made available to the user community via the Virtual Solar Observatory. In 2012, the MPS Division of Astronomi cal Sciences (AST) conducted a community -based review of its portfolio. Prior to receiving the Portfolio Review C ommittee (PRC) report,3 NSF had instructed NSO to begin divestment of the facilities on Kitt Peak, including the McMath- Pierce Solar Telescope and the Vacuum Tower (no longer in use), thereby accelerating the already- planned divestment by a few years. The PRC endorsed this decision. The PRC recommended continued operation of the Dunn Solar Telescope (DST) at Sacramento Peak through 2017 and a 50 .0 percent reduction in funding of NISP. The status of the 1 www.nap.edu/catalog.php?record_id=12951 2 www.nap.edu/search/?term=13060&x=0&y=0 3 www.nsf.gov/mps/ast/ast_portfolio_review.jsp Major Multi -User Research Facilities Facilities - 66 transition of NSO- operated facilities is as follows: McMath -Pierce Solar Telescope, Kitt Peak, AZ: NSO ceased operating the McMath -Pierce Solar Telescope as a national user facility at the end of F Y 2017. In late FY 2018, following a divestment options study and environmental impact analysis, NSF made a five-year award to the Kitt Peak National Observatory Visitor Center, part of NSF's National Optical -infrared Astronomy Research Laboratory , to repurpose the McMath -Pierce facility as an astronomy outreach and education center. This Windows on the Universe Center for Astronomy Outreach will highlight all of NSF's research facilities related to astronomy and astrophysics. Sacramento Peak Observatory, Sunspot, NM : This facility includes the DST and associated infrastructure . NSO ceased operating Sacramento Peak Observatory as a national user facility at the end of FY 2017. In FY 2019, following thorough progr ammatic and environ mental e valuation s of transition options , NSF decided to pursue a potential transition to limited operation of Sacramento Peak by a consortium led by New Mexico State University , which was memorialized in a Record of Decision published in February 2019. NSO Integrated Synoptic Program (GONG and SOLIS) : GONG now has a component of its operations funding provided through a five -year ( August 2016 - August 2021) interagency agreement with the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA). This NOAA funding supports the use of GONG and its data products for operati onal space weather forecasting through August 2021. (Also s ee Partnerships section below).

Partnerships and Other Funding Sources The managing organization for NSO is the Association of Universities for Resear ch in Astronomy, Inc. (AURA) , which comprises 47 U.S. member institutions and three international affiliate members. NSO partners include NOAA, the National Aeronautics and Space Administration , industrial entities, and universities and institutes that collaborate with NSO on solar instrumentation development. New Mexico State University operates the DST at Sunspot Solar Observatory through a consortium of universities while NSO continues to maintain the site infrastructure. NSO has partnered with BBSO to o perate the SOLIS facility in Big Bear, CO . FY 2021 Budget Request to Congress Facilities - 67 The Administration's National Space Weather Strategy and Action Plan (March 2019)4 highlighted the importance of the impacts of space weather on critical infrastructure and society in general, and the importance of operational space weather forecasting. Space weather forecasting requires both accurate models of the heliospheric environme nt and precise observational data inputs to those models. NSO's GONG program provides operational data products on a routine basis that are used as inputs to predictive space weather models from the U.S. Air Force and the NOAA Space Weather Prediction Cent er. NSO is continuing the process of upgrading the GONG facility with $2.50 million of funding provided in FY 2016 , with the upgrade now expected to be completed in FY 2020. NSF and NOAA are currently in the fourth year of a five -year interagency agreement whereby NOAA provides approximately $800,000 per year in funding support for GONG operations. NSO Operations ($4.25 million ) NSO Base Operations includes the offices at NSO's Boulder, C olorado headquarters and the world -wide NSO Integrated Synoptic Program consisting of the GONG array and the SOLIS telescope. NSO also supports U.S. education goals by promoting public understanding and support of science and by providing education and training at all levels. DKIST Operations ($17.54 million ) Support for DKIST operations is through the R&RA account , while DKIST construction support was through the MREFC account. FY 2019 was the final year of construction funding for DKIST and the facility is expected to become fully operational in FY 2020. Management and Oversight NSF Structure: NSF oversight is handled by a program officer in AST working cooperatively with staff from MPS, the Office of the General Counsel, and the Office of Legislative and Public Affairs. Within BFA, the Large Facilities Off ice provides advice to program staff and assists with agency oversight and assurance. Representatives from some of the above NSF offices comprise the NSO Integrated Program Team, which meets on a semi -annual basis to discuss outstanding program issues. The MPS Facilities team and the NSF Chief Officer for Research Facilities also provide high -level guidance and oversight. External Structure: AURA is the managing organization for NSO. The NSO director reports to the president of AURA, who is the principal investigator on the current NSF cooperative agreement. AURA receives management advice from its Solar Observatory Council, composed of members of its scientific and management communities. NSO utilizes a users committee for the purposes of self -evaluation an d prioritization. The users committee, composed of scientists with considerable experience with the observatory, reviews for the NSO director all aspects of NSO that affect user experiences. The NSF program officer for NSO has frequent (at least weekly) di scussions and interactions with NSO management, especially the NSO Director. In addition to NSF reviews of the project, the program officer attends the semi -annual meetings of the Solar Observatory Council and the periodic Users Committee meetings (see be low) as an ex officio observer. The program officer conducts periodic site visits to NSO facilities and attends community science meetings in order to keep abreast of the latest happenings in the solar community Reviews NSF conduc ts regular reviews of NSO's Annual Progress Report and Program Plan (APRPP) . The most recent APRPP review was in March 2019. In July 2019 a comprehensive midterm review of NSO's long -range plan for the second five years of the cooperative agreement was conducted. NSO also participates in reviews of the DKIST project . Recent reviews Major Multi -User Research Facilities Facilities - 68 Execution Plan and Constructi on Status review (April 2019) , an Earned Value Management system surveillance (April 2019), and an incurred cost audit for the American Reinvestment and Recovery Act award for DKIST construction (Aug ust 2018- June 2019). Renewal/Recompetition/Termination In August 2014, NSB authorized a renewed cooperative agreement with AURA for management and operation of NSO . The renew al award started in June 2015 and will run through September 2024. In order to prepare for a potential two -year re- competition process , in mid- 2022, NSF will evaluate the current status of NSO operations and the performance of the managing organization, AURA. The goal will be to determine whether to begin a re -competition of the award for management and operations of the NSO in accordan ce with NSF policy FY 2021 Budget Request to Congress Facilities - 69 NSF'S NATIONAL OPTICAL -INFRARED ASTRONOMY $48,120,000 RESEARCH LABORATORY - $48.12 -$15.69 -24.6% 2 Includes $12.99 million in additional funding for Gemini special projects and $5.73 million for continuity of funding into FY 2020.NSF's National OIR Astronomy Research Laboratory Funding1 (Dollars in FY 2019 Actual2FY 2020 (TBD)FY 2021 RequestChange over FY 2019 Actual 1 Established in early FY 2020, this lab encompasses operations of the mid- scale observatories and Community Science & Data Center, which formerly comprised NOAO, together with operations of the Gemini Observatory and the Vera C. Rubin Observatory. At the start of FY 2020, NSF launched NSF's National Optical -Infrared Astronomy Research Laboratory (henceforth \"the Lab\" ), a Federally Funded Research and Development Center (FFRDC) that will be the foundational hub of U.S. ground- based, optical -infrared (OIR ) astronomy in the era of the Vera C. Rubin Observatory , multi -messenger astrophysics (MMA), data intensive science, and E xtremely Large Telescopes (ELTs). The Lab integrates into a single center the programs and activities that ha ve previously been associated with the National Optical A stronomy Observatory ( NOAO) , the Gemini Observatory, and the Vera C. Rubin Observatory operations (the Lab does not encompass the Rubin Observatory construction project).1 The Lab enables the U.S. research community to pursue a broad range of modern astrophysical challenges , from studying rapidly moving small bodies within the Solar System, to characterizing the most distant galaxies in the early universe and indirect ly observing dark matter and dark energy . The Lab is a strategic priority for the MPS Division of Astronomical Sciences (AST) to facilitate U.S. leadership in OIR astronomy. The Lab will optimiz e scientific synergies, promot e efficient operations among NSF -funded night -time OIR assets, and provide a cornerstone for future NSF investment in the next generation of OIR facilities . The Lab's telescopes will also be used to further NSF's Big Idea , \"Windows on the Universe : The Era of Multi -Messenger Astrophysics ,\" through their participation in MMA research , providing a more complete understanding of the nature of matter and energy and helping answer some of the most fundamental questions in contemporary science. The Lab's facilities, telescopes, and data systems are open to all qualified astronomers regardless of institutional affiliation. It provides services to approximately 1200 scientists annually , 800 of whom are based in the United States. Doctoral dissertation students and non- thesis graduate students from U .S. institutions use the facilities for a broad range of research projects. The Lab currently employs 430 people in Arizona, Hawai 'i, and Chile, including engineers, technicians, support scientists, administrative support staff, postdoctoral fellows and in terns. As NSF builds towards the Vera C. Rubin Observatory operating at full capacity, the need for new staff at the Lab to support operations is expected to steadily increase in the forthcoming years. Lab telescopes continue to make ground- breaking discoveries in all areas of astronomy. Observations from Gemini have been used to determine the location of a repeating Fast Radio Burst (FRB) in a nearby galaxy, making it the closest known example to Earth and only the second repeating FRB to have its location 1 See the MREFC chapter for information on the Vera C. Rubin Observatory construction project. Major Multi -User Research Facilities Facilities - 70 pinpointed. FRBs are sudden rapid explosions of energy from space that typically last only a few milliseconds and can only be found with radio telescopes . Optical telescopes like Gemini can subsequentl y be used to ide ntify and chara cterize the host galaxy , hopefully shedding some light on the possible source of these remarkable objects. Using Gemini and the Lab 's Mayall Telescope at Kitt Peak , astronomers have uncovered two historic events in which t he Andromeda Galaxy underwent major changes to its structure. The motions of 77 clusters of stars around the bright disk of the galaxy have been measured and associated with two distinct populations, a young group associated with stellar streams, and an ol der, more randomly distributed group. The two populations both orbit the Andromeda Galaxy, but their orbital axes are nearly perpendicular to each other. These data shed light not only on the formation and evolution of the Andromeda Galaxy, but on our own Milky Way Galaxy as well. Overview of NSF's National OIR Astronomy Research Laboratory Programs and Activities Gemini Observatory Over the last two decades, NSF has been a leading partner in operations of the two 8.1- meter Gemini telescopes, located on Maunakea in Hawai 'i at an altitude of 4,200 meters and on the 2,700- meter summit of Cerro Pach\u00f3n in Chile. Technological advances incorporated into the design of the twin Gemini telescopes optimize their imaging capabilities and infrared performance as well as their ability to quickly swap instruments in response to changing atmospheric conditions. Gemini's flexible observing modes also make it ideal for reacting rapidly to opportunities that arise in the new era of MMA. The Lab is developing software an d hardware aimed at enhancing Gemini's ability to respond to transient and MMA phenomena discovered by NSF facilities such as the Vera C. Rubin Observatory, the Laser Interferometer Gravitational- Wave Observatory (LIGO), and the IceCube Neutrino Observator y. NSF also funded the development of a new adaptive optics system for Gemini -North in FY 2018 and FY 2019 as part of the Gemini in the Era of Multi -Messenger Astronomy (GEMMA) project. Vera C. Rubin Observatory Since 2014, NSF, in partnership with the De partment of Energy (DOE), has been constructing the Vera C. Rubin Observatory (formerly known as the Large Synoptic Survey Telescope) , an 8.4- meter wide -field optical survey telescope located near Gemini -South in Chile. With its 3.2 billion pixel camera an d 10- square degree field of view, the Vera C. Rubin Observatory will rapidly survey the southern sky with a cadence enabling repeat observation of each survey field approximately twice weekly , and will produce a long- lived data set of unprecedented utility. Once complete, it will be the U.S. flagship ground- based OIR observatory, producing the deepest, widest -field sky image ever and issuing alerts for chan ging and transient objects within 60 s econds of their discovery. Commencement of the initial 10 -year survey is planned for FY 2023. NSF funding of activities associated with operations planning and preparation began in FY 2019. For more information on th e construction project , see the MREFC chapter. Mid-Scale Observatories (MSO) The class telescopes Observatory (KPNO) in Arizona and Cerro Tololo Inter -American Observatory (CTIO) in Chile (see t able below ), formerly operated by NOAO, have been a critical resource for research in OIR astronomy for several decades. KPNO and CTIO, now collectively known as the Mid- Scale Observatories, have been revitalized in recent years through the development of new instruments and observing modes. The Dark Energy Camera (DECam) on the Blanco telescope recently completed the very productive Dark Energy Survey and is now being used for other frontier scientific surveys. The NASA -NSF Exoplanet Observational Research (NN-EXPLORE) program's Doppler (DESI) , at the WIYN and Mayall telescopes respectively, will be commissioned in FY 2020, providing powerful new capabilities in exoplanet research and cosmology. T he SOuthern Astronomical Research (SOAR) telescope, FY 2021 Budget Request to Congress Facilities - 71 while continuing to serve its diverse, international community, is developing its role as an important mid - sized facility f or follow -up of transients identified by the Vera C. Rubin Observatory as well as time -domain astronomy in general over the coming decade .

CSDC has also taken a lead role in the brokering of time -domain alerts from the Vera C. Rubin Observatory through its Arizona -NOAO Temporal Analysis and Response to Events System (ANTARES ) and Astronomical Event Observatory Network ( AEON) collaborations with t he University of Arizona, the Gemini Observatory, the Las Cumbres Observatory, and the Zwicky Transient Facility. In FY 2019, AEON was used to commission queue -based observing at SOAR. Lab Partnerships The Lab and its components support several important national and international partnerships on behalf of NSF. The Gemini Observatory is managed on behalf of the Gemini international partnership which includes NSF, the National Research Council (NRC) of Canada, the Comisi\u00f3n Nacional de Investigaci\u00f3n Cient\u00ed fica Productiva (MCTIP) of Argentina , and the Korea Astronomy and Space Science Institute (KASI) of South Korea . These six agencies are signatories to the Gemini International Agreement, which the partnership is working toward renewing before the end of 2021 when the current agreement expires. The SOAR telescope is supported by MCTIC of Brazil, NSF's National OIR Astronomy Research Laboratory, the University of North Carolina Chapel Hill , and Michigan State University ; a new SOAR agreement will be signed in late FY 2020. The WIYN telescope is owned and operated by a consortium compris ing the University of Wisconsin, Indiana University, NSF's National OIR Astronomy Research Laboratory , the University of Missouri, and Purdue University. NSF's continued participation is built around a partnership with the National Aeronautics and Space Ad ministration (NASA) , which has funded a state -of-the-art instrument for extrasolar planet studies under the NN -EXPLORE program mentioned above. Key agreements between NSF and DOE have supported not only the construction of the Vera C. Rubin Observatory , but also the recently completed Dark Energy Survey at the Blanco telescope and the construction and future operations of DESI on the Maya ll. DOE assumed full operations funding of the Mayall telescope in FY 2019. Many U.S. universities support their own astronomical facilities at the KPNO and CTIO sites with reimbursed services provided by the Lab . The Lab typically receives approximately $11 million each Major Multi -User Research Facilities Facilities - 72 year from partnerships (WIYN, Mayall and SOAR), for reimbursed s ervices provided to tenant observator ies at KPNO and CTIO, from the Kitt Peak Visitors Center, and from grants from other federal agencies. Construction and subsequent development of the Lab's telescopes and their instrumentation has involve d many industr ial entities in several countries, with areas of specialization that included large and complex optical systems, engineering, electronics, electro -mechanical systems, and computing. Education and Public Outreach The Lab supports U.S. educational goals by promoting the public understanding of science and by providing education and training opportunities at all levels. The observatories introduce undergraduate students to scientific research by providing stimulating environments for basic astronomical research and related technologies through internship programs . The Lab maintains a diverse education progr am that includes teacher training programs based in Tucson , Arizona and La Serena, Chile, week -long school visit programs in Hawai' i and Chile (Gemini's Journey Through the Universe program in Hawai'i is now in its 16th year) , visitor centers at Kitt Peak and Cerro Tololo, and a web -based information portal. With supplementary support from NSF, the Lab is also converting the recently retired McMath -Pierce Solar Telescope on Kitt Peak into a new, self -supporting astronomy visualization and presentation cent er with a focus on MMA. The center, to be known as the Windows on the Universe Center for Astronomy Outreach ( WoUCAO) , will include a Science On a Sphere (SOS) visualization system and a GeoDome Digital Planetarium, along with interactive exhibits and an 34.65 - - - - - Vera C.

The FY 2021 Request provides funding for facility operations and maintenance costs that will maintain this partner share (the other interna tional participants intend to contribute a further $10.08 million in FY 2021 for operations) . Vera C. Rubin Observatory Operations NSF made an initial award of $ 11.10 million in FY 2018 to cover expected pre -operations costs through FY 2021. Due to chan ges in the Observatory's operations model,2 additional pre -operations funding of $5.0 million is now anticipated for FY 2021 to support the ramp- up of activities associated with observatory operations. The Lab is managed for NSF by the Association of Universities for Research in Astronomy, Inc. (AURA) , which i s comprised of 47 U .S. institutions and three international affiliates . NSF Structure: In consultation with community representatives, three AST Program Officers, working as a team, carry out continuing oversight and assessment of the Lab and its component programs, MSO, CSDC, Gemini, and Vera C. Rubin Observatory operations, by making use of detailed annual program plans, long- range plans, quarterly finan ce and technical reports, and retrospective annual reports. A set of pre -defined Key Performance Indicators have been established to measure performance; these are defined in a Performance Evaluation and Measurement Plan. To address issues as they arise, A ST also leads an Integrated Program Team (IPT) for the Lab, which includes representatives from AST as well as other NSF offices, including the Office of General Counsel, the Division of Acquisition and Cooperative Support, and the Large Facilities Office. The MPS facilities team and the NSF Chief Officer for Research Facilities also provide high -level guidance, support, and oversight. Gemini Governance Structure: The Gemini Observatory is governed by the Gemini Board, the roles and responsibilities of whic h are codified in the Gemini International Agreement. This board meets at least twice a year and acts as the primary forum for interactions and decisions among the participants in the Gemini Agreement; it ensures that Gemini is managed and operated in accordance with the Agreement and is the body with overall budgetary and policy control over the obse rvatory. The Gemini Board has two standing subcommittees, the Gemini Finance Committee (GFC) and the Gemini Science and Technology Advisory Committee (STAC) , which provide support and input to the Board. NSF serves as the Executive Agency for the partnersh ip, carrying out the project on their behalf. An AST Program Officer holds a seat on the Gemini Board and acts as the chair of the GFC. Vera C. Rubin Observatory Governance Structure: The operation of th is new observatory includes a management board with m embers from the NSF and DOE managing organizations, AURA and the SLAC National Accelerator Laboratory , respectively.

CA makes timely investments that (1) initiate new capabilities to accelerate convergence research in areas of national importance, and (2) build capacity in multi -stakeholder convergence teams to address these critical challenges. Focusing on use -inspired, convergence research, with directed deliverables and using an approach that rewards innovation, risk -taking, and transition to use, CA has customized various models and techniques o f acceleration and innovat ion activities that have proven successful outside the federal government . For more information on convergence research, see the Growing Convergence Research narrative in this chapter. NSF is well positioned to implement an acceleration of convergence research. CA complements NSF's existing programs and enhances NSF's capacity to move ideas from discovery into practice. NSF has a unique role with colleges and universities, which are critical participants in this activity, as well as with other stakeholders , such as other federal agencies, industry, non- profits, foundations, and funding agencies around the world. The CA is aligned with, build s upon, and stimulate s new directions for NSF directorates' foundational research investments. Therefore, the CA will complement NSF's portfolio of funding mechanisms to accelerate research. To surface grand challenge research ideas/themes that are of mutual interest to academia , government, and industry, CA use s a variety of methods, such as multi -stakeholder roundtable s and workshops . These themes are referred to as \"tracks\" with anticipated time horizons for each track of up to three years. Each track will comprise a number of multi -stakeholder teams that will work collaboratively to accelerate science and engineering for that particular research theme. The initial CA pilot in FY 2019 focuse d on two of NSF's research Big Ideas: HDR and FW -HTF. Tracks that come from these particular research areas have been identified by the cross- agency CA Working Group and align ed with Administration R&D Priorities, 1 the President's Management Agenda,2 and the U.S. Five - Year STEM Education Strategic Plan.3 The HDR track focuses on advancing data -driven discovery using artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning, through research on the components necessary to create early prototypes of an open knowledge network. The FW -HTF tracks focuses on: (1) team building and creating R&D plans addressing multiple components of AI for connecting workers with jobs of the future, such as predictive AI tools, economic and labor market analyses of needed skills for fut ure workplaces, and AI-assisted educational technologies needed for adult learning; and (2) innovative approaches toward re - envisioning the concepts, structures, and technologies needed for employers to support continuous learning for dynamic, digitally- intensive work, and to provide access to skilled talent pathways, mentors, and for Success: America's Strategy for STEM Education\" National Science -2018.pdf . NSF Convergence Accelerator NSF-Wide Investments - 4 authentic workplace experiences. The CA track investment s are distinguished from the corresponding Big Ideas by the nature of the research, the time scale of the activities supp orted, and the more hands -on, agile approach to project management and support that is envisioned. Goals 1. Accelerate the progress of use -inspired convergence research : Accelerate scientific discovery and innovation by applying more agile team identificat ion, funding, and project management mechanisms to use -inspired, convergence research that requires the integration of knowledge, skills, and methodologies from multiple disciplines and stakeholders. 2. Harness partnerships to design and enable convergence research : Assist academic researchers to engage with non- NSF partners \u2014such as commercial entities, non -profits, foundations, philanthropies, other state or federal agencies, and international funders \u2014to create partnerships that identify high- impact research directions and collaborate to achieve specific research goals. 3. Focus cohorts of teams around broad national goals : Support activities that bring together the range of expertise needed to tackle pressing, transdisciplinary research challenges and enable the formation of advanced research teams. Use competition mechanisms to enable cohorts of teams to progress towards r esearch goals more rapidly than single teams alone. FY 2021 Investments NSF's FY 2021 Request for CA funding is $70.0 million, which will support the following activities: continuing support of the HDR and FW -HTF related CA tracks and see these projects to completion; continuation of the FY 2020 CA tracks that will transition from Phase I to Phase II ; initiation of new FY 2021 CA track projects ; and community workshops, roundtables, and analysis . The new research tracks for FY 2020 and FY 2021 will be stimulated by research in NSF's Big Ideas and other research areas based on mutual interest of the partners and readiness of the research community to respond. New tracks will be develop ed through community workshops, roundtables (e.g., with indust ry, non-profits, and foundations), and analysis of emerging foundational advances in NSF's Big Ideas. Each track will address all three CA goals. NSF anticipates that external partners will begin contribut ing financially to the effort in FY 2021. For the partners, this is a new avenue for R&D, allowing access to academic researchers working at the forefront of knowledge. For the academic researchers, this allows access to partners who are interested in contributing to research projects and the broader them es/tracks. Potential partners will be identified in two different ways: (1) by principal investigators , who understand the key stakeholders for their particular research projects; and (2) by NSF , as it develops new tracks through convenings with industry, foundations, and government agencies and workshops with the relevant research communities. For more information about CA, see the IA narrative in the R&RA chapter. NSF-Wide Investments - 5 HARNESSING THE DATA REVOLUTION FOR 21ST -CENTURY SCIENCE AND ENGINEERING (HDR) FY - 7.41 CISE 64.60 - 52.49 EHR 5.15 - 2.50 ENG 21.87 - 2.85 MPS 32.16 - 19.10 SBE 7.21 - 5.79 IA - - 10.00 Total $174.40 - $157.11HDR Funding (Dollars in Millions) Overview NSF's HDR Big Idea is a national -scale activity to enable novel modes of data -driven discovery that will allow new fundamental questions to be asked and answered at the frontiers of science and engineering. HDR will generate new knowledge and understanding, and accelerat e innovation.

FY 2021 Investments Steward ship Investments Foundations of Data Science ($ 6.0 million) HDR will continue to support research in data science and data -enabled science and engineering primarily through the Transdisciplinary Research In Principles Of Data Science (HDR TRIPODS) program. HDR TRIPODS will bring together the electrical engineering, mathematics, statistics, and theoretical computer science communities. Through integrated research and training activities, these communities will collaborate to develop the theoretical foundations of data science. In FY 2019, Phase I HDR TRIPODS awards (spanning 15 projects) were made to support the development of small, collaborative \"data science institutes\" . Subsequent Phase II awards, planned for FY 2022, will enable a subset of the most successful of these smaller institut es to expand in scope and impact into larger -sized data science institutes. Data -Intensive Research in Science and Engineering ($ 33.0 million) HDR will support Institutes for Data -Intensive Research in Science and Engineering (DIRSE). The DIRSE institute s will complement the HDR TRIPODS institutes described above and will harness diverse data sources and develop new algorithms, methodologies, systems, technologies, and infrastructure for data management and analysis to address critical science and engineering problems. In FY 2021, investment s in HDR DIRSE institutes will emphasize fundamental research and education in AI , focused on machine/deep learning, that will accelerat e data-driven discovery in all fields of science and engineering. The DIRSE institu tes program constitutes a two -phase process involving conceptualization followed by convergence. In FY 2019, NSF issued more than 100 conceptualization awards spanning 28 projects supporting interdisciplinary teams that are conceptualiz ing and pilot ing new modalities for collaboration and convergence that go beyond traditional disciplinary and organizational boundaries. These projects will pave the way to the DIRSE convergence institutes planned for FY 2021. Furthermore, a coordination hub will be established in FY 2021 to support interaction, coordination, and sharing across the DIRSE institutes. By creating a portfolio of interrelated DIRSE institutes, NSF aims to accelerate discovery and innovation in multiple areas of data- intensive science and engineering. Education and Workforce Development ($6.0 million) HDR will continue to support data science education and workforce development through the Data Science Corps (DSC) program. NSF funded 22 DSC awards spanning nine projects in FY 2019. These awards are helping to build the data science workforce by engaging data science students and professionals in real - world data science projects that will help bridge the data -to-knowledge gap in organizations and communities at local, state, national , and international levels . In FY 2021, t he DSC program will continue to provide data science students and professionals with practical experiences, new skills, and teaching opportunities across multiple learning environments ; promote data literacy , including its ethical usage ; and provide basic training in data science to the existing workforce across communities throughout the U nited States. Furthermore, in FY 2021, investment s in HDR DSC will enable education and workforce development of next -generation data scien tists proficient in state -of-the-art AI systems and techniques. Foundational Activities These activities comprise ongoing investments by NSF directorates and offices in programs that laid th e initial foundations for the HDR Big Idea and HDR Track in the Convergence Accelerator ( CA). These activities will continue to be supported and aligned with the overall HDR strategic goals. These foundational activities are currently managed by NSF's dire ctorates and offices and will continue to remain within the directorates and offices with respect to their funding and management. FY 2021 Budget Request to Congress NSF-Wide Investments - 7 HDR engagement with the Convergence Accelerator ( CA) In FY 2021, although not presented in the table above, the CA seeks to transform how the agency supports the most innovative science and engineering, reflecting its commitment to be at the cutting -edge, supporting foundational research, while also encouraging rapid advances through partnerships between academic and non-academ ic stakeholders. Tracks within the CA focus on grand challenge themes that would benefit from acceleration.

NSF-Wide Investments - 8 THE FUTURE OF WORK AT THE HUMAN -TECHNOLOGY FRONTIER (FW -HTF) FY 2019 ActualFY EHR 10.36 - 10.30 ENG 16.97 - 13.78 MPS 1.09 - - SBE 11.43 - 10.93 Total $153.49 - $161.68FW-HTF Funding (Dollars in Millions) Overview The FW-HTF Big Idea supports convergence research to develop new human-technology partnerships leading to increased worker productivity and innovation. This research will prepare the workforce for human-technology partnerships by combining the benefits of new technologies, such as artificial intelligence (AI) and virtual environments, with increased understanding of value -based social, economic, and educational opportunities and impacts. The landscape of jobs and work is changing with unprecedented speed, driven by the development of new technol ogies that have moved from the factory floor to an expanding array of knowledge and service occupations. These changes, while promising benefits to the Nation in the creation of new industries of the future and related occupations, increased productivity, enhanced innovation, and sustained U.S. global leadership, come with risks for workers as technology may substantially alter, and in some cases, eliminate jobs. The FW-HTF Big Idea started in FY 2018 and responds to the challenges and opportunities associated with the changing landscape of jobs and work. FW -HTF is support ing new convergent research to understand and advance the human-technology partnership, design new technologies to augment human performance, illuminate the emerging socio -technological l andscape, and foster lifelong and pervasive learning with technology. Investments in research and development at the human -technology frontier are enabl ing technologies that amplify and augment human capabilities to learn, adapt, make decisions, and make s ense of complex patterns and situations in the work context. It is necessary to fund interdisciplinary research at the intersection of computer and information science, engineering, social, behavioral, and economic sciences, and education. Increasing hu man capabilities is the result of the incorporation of advances in AI, data science, and closely related technologies for sensing, actuation, coordination, communication, and control with humans in the loop; and depends upon understanding human communication, thinking, and action. These advances will underpin the creation of systems that are adaptive, human -centered, and capable of collaborative interactions with humans. By evaluating the aspects of work that humans do most effectively and the complementary aspects of work that emerging technologies can improve, FW -HTF research will support advances that improve work quality, increase worker productivity, and make work more meaningful. Additionally, these research investments will enable an understanding of how these changes will affect society and what new approaches to education and training will be required. Moreover, NSF investments will explore the ethical and societal implications of emerging technologies, such as AI, FY 2021 Budget Request to Congress NSF-Wide Investments - 9 and advance the pursuit and adoption of responsible and ethical approaches to using data and furthering data science for work and workers. These research investments will accelerate progress and enable the Nation's workforce and economy to lead in a future that is increasingly and unavoidably driven by technology and knowledge. Goals The FW-HTF Big Idea seeks to maximize benefits and minimize risks of the changing technological environment, to foster support of the workforce in increasing productivity and innovation, and to lay the foundation for new knowledge and developments in science and engineering through the following four strategic goals: 1. Understand and build the human-technology partnership: Research on the future of work will identify how new technologies affect jobs, the workplace, organizations, and society, as well as how these technologies can be designed and built to increase national productivity, job opportunities, and worker satisfaction, while enabling worker creativity. 2. Design and develop new technologies to augment human performance : By augmenting the physical and mental capabilities of humans, new technology can open new job opportunities. For example, using AI-based, real -time, adaptive physical and cognitive prosthetics can increase job opportunities for those with disabilities and enhance capabilities in all individuals in manufacturing settings. 3. Illuminate the emerging socio -technological landscape : As technology becomes increasingly capable, companies and organizations will be transformed, as will society, the economy, and relevant laws. Research will clarify the benefits and risks of such change and help inform ethical and value -based design of new technology and software in support of a diverse workforce. 4. Foster lifelong and pervasive learning through technology : Design of training, including novel AI-based approaches, will support both the training and reskilling that the workforce needs to work with new technology and to enable workers to migrate from old jobs to new ones. Adaptive, pervasive training system s will depend on new research in cyberlearning systems, as well as the integration of training into task performance and management. FY 2021 Investments Stewardship Activities FY 2021 activities will leverage the investments made through the FY 2018 and FY 2019 FW -HTF solicitations1 that support research on advancing cognitive and physical capabilities in the context of human-technology interactions, the evolving symbiosis of human and AI in work, and the understanding and explanation of productivity, innovation, and learning in the workplace. In addition, these activities will leverage new funding opportunities released in FY 2020 that continue to emphasize the four FW -HTF strategic goals listed above. FY 2021 catalytic activities will include standa rd research grants, workshops, and grants for planning and coordination. These funding opportunities will set the foundation for future integrative activities such as collaboration hubs, center -scale institutes , and larger -scale grants in FY 2021 and beyon d. During FY 2020 and 2021 , FW-HTF will also develop synergies with other NSF Big Ideas and NSF -wide efforts, including GCR, HDR, Mid -scale RI, NSF INCLUDES, and NRT. Foundational Activities Foundational activities comprise continued investments by partic ipating directorates and offices in existing (ongoing) NSF programs that have laid the foundation for the FW -HTF Big Idea . Also, FW-HTF tracks within the C onvergence Accelerator will continue to be aligned with FW-HTF goals. These foundational programs are currently managed by NSF's directorates and offices and will remain within the directorates and offices with respect to their funding and management. 1 www.nsf.gov/pubs/2019/nsf19541/nsf19541.htm The Future of Work at the Human-Technology Frontier NSF-Wide Investments - 10 The FW-HTF Track within th e NSF Convergence Accelerator (CA) In FY 2021, although not presented in the table above, the CA seeks to transform how the agency supports the most innovative science, reflecting its commitment to be at the cutting edge, by supporting foundational research while encouraging rapid advances through partnerships between academic and non-academic stakeholders. CA tracks focus on grand challenge themes that would benefit from acceleration. FW -HTF activities within the CA aim to strengthen the U.S. economy, impr ove worker performance and job satisfaction, and facilitate lifelong learning. Example projects include efforts to match workers with jobs of the future and to develop living laboratories, such as in classrooms and manufacturing environments, where hypothe ses about learning and productivity will be tested. FW-HTF activities with in the CA will be informed by analysis of emerging foundational advances in FW-HTF research and input from stakeholders. These activities will align with, build upon, and help reshape directorates' foundational research investments. For more information, refer to the CA narrative in this chapter. NSF-Wide Investments - 11 NAVIGATING THE NEW ARCTIC (NNA) FY 2019 ActualFY 2020 (TBD)FY 2021 Request Stewardship - $30.00 Foundational Activities $14.47 - $10.75 BIO 1.50 - 1.43 EHR 1.49 - 1.19 ENG 4.78 - 1.90 SBE 0.64 - 0.48 4.75 Total $44.47 - $40.75NNA Funding (Dollars in Millions) Overview Arctic temperatures are rising faster than nearly everywhere else on Earth. The rapid and wide-scale changes occurring in response to this warming portend new opportunities and risks to natural systems; social and cultural systems; economic, political, and legal systems; and infrastruct ure and other engineered systems of the Arctic and across the globe. Gaps in scientific observations and the prevalence of interdependent social, natural, and built systems in the Arctic make it challenging to predict the region's future. Understanding and adapting to a changing Arctic will require creative new directions for Arctic- specific research, education, workforce development, and leveraging of science, engineering, and technology advances from outside the Arctic. NNA, one of NSF's Big Ideas, embod ies the Foundation's forward -looking response to these profound challenges. NNA seeks innovations in Arctic observational networks and fundamental convergence research across engineering and the social, natural, environmental, and computing and information sciences, that address the interactions or connections between natural and built environments and social systems and how these connections inform our understanding of Arctic change and its local and global effects. NNA empowers new research communities; diversifies the next generation of Arctic researchers ; integrates the co -production of knowledge with local and Indigenous people and organizations ; and engages with interdisciplinary, interagency, and international partners to further pan-Arctic and Arctic-global perspectives. With respect to observational research, NNA will address key gaps in the existing array of observation, communication, computation and data systems . Strong coupling of observation, communication, and computation and data, including the theoretical foundations underlying these, will be supported to ensure progress. NNA will leverage r esources with the Mid -scale RI and HDR Big Idea s as appropriate. NNA also strongly encourages projects with components that advance STEM education ; that deepen public understanding of the changing Arctic to benefit both citizens and policy makers; and that advance workforce -development objectives. NNA will build on NSF's STEM investments and the NSF INCLUDES Big Idea to encourage innovative and appropriately evaluated education and public engagement efforts that leverage exciting NNA science and inspire diverse participation in STEM. By drawing upon expertise from across the agency, NNA investments will accelerate research needed to inform decisions regarding the national security, economic development, and societal well -being of the Navigating the New Arctic NSF-Wide Investments - 12 U.S. as an Arctic nation and enable resilient, sustainable Arctic communities. NSF plans to invest in NNA through FY 2023. Goals 1. Improved understanding of Arctic chan ge and its local and global effects that capitalizes on: innovative and optimized observation infrastructure; advances in understanding of fundamental processes; and new approaches to modeling interactions among the natural environment, built environment, and social systems. 2. New and enhanced research communities that are diverse, integrative, and well -positioned to carry out productive research on the interactions or connections between Arctic natural and built environments and social systems and how these connections inform our understanding of Arctic change and its local and global effects. 3. Research outcomes that inform U.S. national security , economic development, and societal well -being and enable resilient, sustainable Arctic communities. 4. Enhanced effor ts in formal and informal education that focus on the multi-scale impacts of Arctic change on natural and built environments and social systems and broadly disseminate research outcomes. In FY 2017, NSF issued a Dear Colleague letter (DCL) on the Growing Convergence Research Big Idea (NSF 17 -065) 1 to explore convergence approaches within four of the research-focused NSF Big Ideas, including NNA. This DCL requested proposals for Research Coordination Networks (RCNs), wo rkshops, and activities to enhance Arctic observational systems. In FY 2018, NSF issued a DCL on Stimulating Research Related to NNA (NSF 18 -048),2 requesting research proposals building on the FY 2017 awards, as well as proposals for workshops and RCNs. NSF awarded 25 new projects under these two DCLs and related opportunities with budgets ranging from $50,000 to $1.50 million lasting up to 60 months. In FY 2019, NSF issued a solicitation for NNA (NSF 19 -511)3 and made 13 awards to support research proje cts, and eight awards to support planning projects that will develop convergence research teams, with budgets ranging from $13,000 to $3.0 million lasting up to 60 months. FY 2021 Investments NSF's NNA activities in FY 2021 will focus on enabling advances in priority areas, which will be developed by building on outcomes from FY 2017 to FY 2020 activities. In FY 2020, NNA is focus ing on convergent social/built/natural environment systems scienc e; advances in observation, communication, and computation and and community-coordination activities . In FY 2021, NSF will continue support for NNA, and expects to issue another solicitation. NSF will continue to coordinate and leverage NNA-related activities with external stakeholders, including: other federal agencies through the Interagency Arctic Research Policy Committee chaired by the NSF Director; local residents and indigenous peoples through state and local governance structures o f Alaska; and international partners through fora such as the biannual International Arctic Science Ministerial. The portfolio of FY 2021 NNA activities will support the goals listed above. 1 www.nsf.gov/pubs/2017/nsf17065/nsf17065.jsp 2 www.nsf.gov/pubs/2018/nsf18048/nsf18048.jsp 3 www.nsf.gov/pubs/2019/nsf19511/nsf19511.htm NSF-Wide Investments - 13 FY ActualFY 2020 (TBD)FY 2021 - $28.42 - $34.36 BIO - - 0.95 CISE 1.87 - 2.00 ENG 4.15 - 1.90 - 1.00 Total $58.44 Funding1 (Dollars in Millions) 1 Funding for QL and QIS overlaps in some areas. Thus, it should not be summed across presentations. Overview The QL Big Idea builds upon and extends existing knowledge of the quantum world to observe, interact with, and control, from first principles, the behavior of particles at atomic and subatomic scales. It enables discoveries in both naturally occurring and engineered quantum systems and will develop next generation quantum technologies and devices for sensing, information processing, communications, and computing. These advances will unleash the potential of the Nation's quantum -based scientific enterprise to enhance the Nation's well- being, economy, and security. NSF's investment in QL is aligned with the Administration's Quantum Info rmation Science (QIS) effort as well as Congressional priorities as noted in the National Quantum Initiative (NQI) Act , P.L. 115- 368.1 In its third year of investment in QL, NSF envisions continuing to advance fundamental understanding of how quantum ph enomena at the subatomic scale are manifested at the macroscopic scale. Discovery will lead to new methods of characterization and control, enhance predictive and modeling capabilities, and catalyze new computing, networking, and measurement paradigms. Cross -disciplinary approaches, combining experimentation, computation, and theory, will help to identify the knowledge and skills necessary for the responsible conduct of quantum research to make fundamental advances in quantum science. Educational research on the learning and teaching of quantum concepts will contribute to the development of the future quantum workforce. QL investments will empower U.S. scientists and engineers to advance quantum technologies and understanding, which will in turn lead to the discovery of novel materials, tools, devices, algorithms, simulations, systems, and programming paradigms, as well as new and creative application domains, along with a quantum -capable workforce. NSF will also broadly engage scientific, engineering, and educational communities to build a human capital foundation in pursuit of a better understanding of quantum phenomena. Consistent with and crucial to its mission, NSF will form partnerships with other federal agencies, industry, private foundations, nati onal laboratories, and existing centers in order to leverage NSF's investments in QL. NSF coordinates QL activities with other federal agencies through the National Science and 1 www.congress.gov/115/bills/hr6227/BILLS -115hr6227enr.pdf The Quantum Leap NSF-Wide Investments - 14 Technology Council Subcommittee on Quantum Information Science (SCQIS).

FY 2021 Investments In FY 2021, QL activities will focus on enabling advances in selected priority areas, building on outcomes from FY 2019 and FY 2020 activities, and adjusting emphases, as warranted, to address new emerging areas. In FY 2019, NSF initiated two center -scale, cross- directorate activities resulting in awards that will continue to receive funding in FY 2021. Awards made through the solicitation, \"Enabling Quantum Leap: Convergent Accelerated Discovery Foundries for Quantum Materials Science, Engineering, and Information,\" 3 will provide support for accelerated quantum materials design, synthesis, characterization, and translation for quantum devices, systems, and networks. The \"Quantum Leap Challenge Institutes (QLCI)\"4 solicitation called for proposals for quantum institutes that will receive the first year of funding in FY 2020. As part of the QLCI solicitation, in FY 2019, NSF also supported conceptualization grants for workshops and related activities that are helping teams to coalesce and develop institute p roposals for competition in a second round of review; the institutes selected from the second round will receive the first year of funding in FY 2021. QLCI research will identify and address science and engineering challenges in fundamental at -scale problems in quantum communication, quantum computing, quantum sensing, and quantum simulations. 2 www.whitehouse.gov/wp RULES (UROL) FY - $109.26 BIO 58.80 - 57.00 CISE 7.66 - 4.75 ENG 5.63 - 2.85 GEO 4.00 - 3.80 MPS 27.30 - 37.06 SBE 4.85 - 3.80 Total $138.24 - $139.26URoL Funding (Dollars in Millions) Overview The URoL NSF Big Idea aims to create a new paradigm at the convergence of science, engineering, and technology that will elucidate theoretical frameworks, or rules, to enable prediction of the diversity of solutions that biological systems use to support life processes. Advances in understanding life at the fundamental level of the genome will enable re-engineering of cells, organisms, and ecosystems, and innovative biochemicals and biomaterials that sustain a vibrant bioeconomy and strengthen society. URoL also aims to train the next generation of researchers capable of using those rules and theories not only to predict the behavior of living sys tems, but to design them to benefit humankind . Associated with URoL, NSF funds convergent research across the Foundation that addresses questions from the molecular to the ecosystem scale, and across biological diversity . These include foundational resear ch on genetic variation and phenotypic emergence; the ethical and social implications and societal acceptance of new biotechnologies, such as tools for genetic engineering and synthetic biology; ecological forecasting; and machine learning to predict phenotype. In addition, in FY 2021, NSF will fund new awards in mathematical and physical sciences that utilize theory and novel experimental tools to address fundamental problems in biological systems and build capacity in a convergent research domain; new programs in synthetic biology that enable creation of novel chemicals, materials, and engineered systems; and infrastructure that further enables URoL research. These associated activities align with the Administration's R&D budgetary priorities and are expected to continue in FY 2022. In FY 2018, NSF released several Dear Colleague Letters to announce URoL opportunities for catalytic activities. Building on those, in FY 2019, NSF made 38 new awards for 14 collaborative projects in response to two Foundation -wide URoL solicitations: Understanding the Rules of Life: Building a Synthetic Cell: An Ideas Lab Activity 1 and Understanding the Rules of Life: Epigenetics .2 The awards, totaling $36 million, demonstrate NSF's commitment to applying interdisciplinary approaches to uncovering the rules , and their exceptions , that govern the essential features of life at all scales, from cells to ecosystems. In FY 2020 NSF antic ipates funding projects in response to the re -issued Understanding the Rules of Life: Epigenetics solicitation , and in response to a new NSF-wide solicitation , Understanding the Rules of Life: Microbiome Theory and Mechanisms .3 Also in FY 2020, NSF will invite proposals for research networks to build 1 www.nsf.gov/funding/pgm_summ.jsp?pims_id=505600 2 www.nsf.gov/funding/pgm_summ.jsp?pims_id=505582 3 www.nsf.gov/funding/prgm_summ.jsp?pims_id=505694 Understanding the Rules of Life NSF-Wide Investments - 16 capacity in URoL research domains. NSF anticipates that URoL will run through FY 2023. Goals 1. To support a convergence of science, engineering, and technology in discovery of rules governing the emergence of robust, resilient, and adaptable phenotypes at three levels of biological organization, across the tree of life: (1) cells and cell systems; (2) multi -cellular organisms and their co -dependent microbial associations; and (3) complex networks of organisms a nd species involving social, ecological, and population dynamics. These rule sets are referred to as, respectively, minimal rules, interaction rules, and complexity rules. Understanding the rules at these three different scales should enable the prediction of the behavior of living systems and how those systems interact with, respond to, and modify the environment, and will facilitate the engineering of biological systems and enable new forms of bio-manufacturing that are ethically sound , societally acceptable, and that can benefit humankind. 2. To support the discovery of scale -invariant rules that govern living systems. These theories will begin to explain the existence of a diversity of solutions that biology creates and uses to solve the essential problems of living systems at all scales: maintenance and transmission of information (genome); capture and conversion of raw materials to make biochemicals and biomaterials that make up a living system; capture and conversion of energy to support all life processe s; and reproduction to perpetuate the species. These universal, scale-invariant rules will serve to help improve human health and safety (e.g., agricultural adaptability, food safety, environmental sustainability, and disease prevention). 3. To support networ ks of researchers, technology developers, and educators engaged in URoL activities and thereby further the development of a robust community, with an impact that is sustained beyond the five -year investment in the URoL Big Idea. The convergent nature of re search addressing emergent properties of life should stimulate technological innovation that feeds back to drive the science forward. This includes development of: new and improved techniques in molecular, genomic, and cellular examination and manipulation; improved technologies for the capture of biological, behavioral, and social phenotypic data in free -living organisms , including new sensors and observing capabilities from nano- to macro -spatial and temporal scales; advances in data analysis, such as machine learning , as well as computation and complex modeling to support learning and simulation-driven URoL investigations; more cap able cyberinfrastructure to support robust, data - and computational -enabled URoL discovery and sharing of research results; and advances in theory coming from all of these sciences and engineering. The predictive goals of URoL also guide investments in tra ining and workforce development to produce scientists that have a firm grounding in the life sciences as well as the mathematical, physical, computational, behavioral and/or social sciences and engineering that enable them to work collaboratively across di sciplinary boundaries. Finally, URoL provides a rich context in which to expand science-literacy efforts, in both formal and informal learning environments, aimed at diverse communities across the nation. Research networks provide a mechanism for sustained support of distributed groups of investigators working to achieve URoL goals. FY 2021 Investments URoL activities in FY 2021 will build upon the investments made in FY 2019 and FY 2020. The FY 2020 solicitation supporting microbiome research will continue in FY 2021, enabling deeper exploration of interaction rules (Goal 1). A new solicitation will be developed to support research that addresses convergence approaches for the discovery of scale-invariant rules that govern living systems (Goal 2). The URoL: Research Networks solicitation that will be released in FY 2020 will also continue in FY 2021, supporting networks of researchers, technology developers, and educators in different URoL domains (Goal 3). URoL -associated activities include continued support of convergent programs initiated in FY 2019 and planned for FY 2021 across all directorates, most of which address Goal s 1 and 3. NSF-Wide Investments - 17 WINDOWS ON THE UNIVERSE (WOU ) FY 2019 ActualFY $17.68 - $22.90 MPS 17.68 - 21.00 OPP - - 1.90 Total $47.68 - $52.90WoU Funding (Dollars in Millions) Overview For millennia, humankind has viewed the universe through the optical part of the electromagnetic spectrum to which human eyes are sensitive. Over the last half century, this range has been extended to observe electromagnetic radiation across the full spectrum from radio waves to X-rays and gamma rays. Observatories constructed and operated over the past two decades have extended this view to include high - energy particles such as neutrin os and cosmic rays. Most recently, with LIGO, NSF has established the ability to view the universe through gravitational waves. This ushers in the era of multi -messenger astrophysics. The three messengers\u2014 electromagnetic radiation, high -energy astrophysica l particles, and gravitational waves\u2014 each provide unique information. Together, they provide a detailed picture of the Universe that allows scientists to study matter, energy, and the cosmos in fundamentally new ways\u2014 through several powerful and diverse \"w indows\". WoU builds these capabilities and accelerates the synergy and interoperability of the three messengers to realize integrated, multi -messenger astrophysical exploration of the Universe. Prior investments have led to important recent discoveries th at demonstrate the power of WoU. The coincident detection of gravitational waves and electromagnetic radiation identified a merging binary neutron star system, confirmed Einstein's theory of General Relativity, and revealed critical information on the orig in of heavy elements. Recent observations of high energy neutrino emission coincident with gamma - ray flares from the nucleus of an active galaxy have revealed for the first time an astrophysical source of high energy cosmic rays. These discoveries, along with others, have heralded the era of multi -messenger astrophysics. WoU is anticipated to be a 10 -year effort and builds upon decades of prior investments in individual and large-scale efforts. These include both presently operating observatories such as I ceCube (for the detection of high-energy neutrinos) and LIGO (for the detection of gravitational waves) as well as development efforts for future experiments. In the FY 2019 Request, stewardship funding for WoU was first introduced and was complemented by the ongoing investments in foundational activities aimed at building capabilities for each of the three messengers. This funding strategy (stewardship funding supplemented with investments in foundational activities) will continue in FY 2021. These investm ents will also serve to grow the workforce not only for multi -messenger astrophysics but also for engineering, data science, and many other areas. Goals 1. Enhancing and accelerating the theoretical, computational, and observational activities within the scientific community : Support efforts within the scientific community to build the observational and analysis capabilities in each of the three window areas, integrate the different research communities to Windows on the Universe NSF-Wide Investments - 18 develop full interoperability between the three windows, and develop a new workforce that is skilled in this new paradigm. 2. Building dedicated instrumentation and capabilities : Construct experiments and instrumentation or develop cyberinfrastructure that will make critical contributions to the multi-messeng er research infrastructure by enabling new capabilities in energy range or sky coverage, improved sensitivity, or new experimental or computational capabilities. The Big Idea: Mid -scale Research Infrastructure program, described elsewhere in this chapter, is an essential part of realizing this goal. 3. Exploiting current facilities and developing the next generation of observatories : Enhance infrastructure and provide modest upgrades to enable full utilization of the current generation of multi-messenger faci lities, and support planning and development for the next generation of observatories to accelerate progress to realize significantly greater capabilities and extend the scientific reach. FY 2021 Investments WoU continues to be implemented through a dedi cated program, \"Windows on the Universe: The Era of Multi-Messenger Astrophysics (WoU-MMA).\" 1 The WoU -MMA program includes the Division of Astronomical Sciences and the Division of Physics within MPS, and OPP within GEO. The WoU-MMA program will address all of the WoU goals. Stewardship funding ($ 30.0 million) resides in the MPS Office of Multidis ciplinary Activities but will be allocated to awards from all participating divisions and directorates on the basis of merit and portfolio balance. Participating divisions and offices may elect to supplement this allocation through foundational activities in core research programs in order to advance particularly compelling scientific opportunities related to WoU. For MPS this is expected to be primarily through research grants in astronomy, particle astrophysics, and gravitational physics. OPP will supplem ent the WoU allocation with grants from the Antarctic Astrophysics and Geospace Sciences program. Other NSF divisions may participate where activities originating in their divisions meet the WoU criteria. 1 PD 18 -5115: www.nsf.gov/funding/pgm_summ.jsp?pims_id=505593 NSF-Wide Investments - 19 GROWING CONVERGENCE (GCR) 2019 ActualFY 2020 (TBD)FY 2021 Request $15.80 - $15.20(Dollars Millions)GCR Funding Overview Growing Convergence Research ( GCR ) is an enabling idea within NSF's Big Ideas that empowers the U.S. research community to leverage multiple scientific and engineering (S&E) disciplines and develop novel research strategies to address extremely challenging and complex problems. GCR research challenges are inspired by deep scientific questions or pressing societal needs and require the integration of multi - disciplinary perspectives. The grand challenges of today\u2014such as exploring the universe at all scales; developing infrastructure resili ent to extreme events and geo -hazards; combining biology, physical sciences, engineering, computer and cognitive science to produce the machines and materials of the future; and creating the breakthroughs that will enable the industries of the future \u2014will not be solved by one discipline alone. They require convergence: the merging of ideas, approaches, tools, and technologies from widely diverse fields of knowledge to stimulate innovation and discovery. Convergence research is a means of solving complex research problems that have two unifying characteristics: (1) they have the potential to make a significant impact, either on fundamental understanding in S&E or on the Nation's ability to meet pressing societal challenges, or both; and (2) they require the i ntegration of knowledge, tools, and ways of thinking from multiple disciplines. NSF's GCR responds in part to recommendations from major reports describing the importance of convergence for the research ecosystem . Key reports include National Academies o f Science, Engineering, and Medicine reports from 2014 1 and 2017,2 Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT) reports from 20113 and 2016,4 and a 2013 report published by Springer.5 These reports emphasize the importance of convergence approaches to S&E research to address grand challenges and underline the importance of team science to such efforts. These reports also emphasize the role of federal funding agencies in realizing the benefits of convergence by expanding mechanisms for funding convergenc e research. Goals Since the GCR Big Idea began in FY 2017, t he goals of GCR are to: 1. Catalyze convergence approaches to solve compelling scientific and engineering research problems at the intersection of existing disciplines; and 2. Enhance NSF's review process to more effectively assess the merit of convergence research proposals. 1 Convergence: Facilitating Transdisciplinary Integration of Life Sciences, Physical Sciences, Engineering, and Beyond.

To support convergence research, NSF is enhancing its review processes to address the key technical, organizational, and logistical challenges that hinder the evaluation of truly integrative res earch. GCR's strategic investments in emerging convergence research themes will support the development of new fields of inquiry, discovery of the knowledge necessary for society to develop solutions or technologies to address important societal challenges, and training in convergence research. GCR uses several mechanisms to accomplish programmatic goals, including: Capacity -Building Activities : GCR seeks to broaden the range of those engaged in convergence efforts. A portion of GCR funds is invested in ca pacity -building activities, such as workshops, Ideas Labs, and Research Coordination Networks (RCNs). NSF remains open to novel approaches to capacity- building that may be suggested by researchers and other stakeholders. One goal of capacity -building is to foster new partnerships between U.S. academic researchers and other sectors such as industry, federal laboratories, non- profit research organizations, and the international research community. Another emphasis is to broaden demographic diversity of teams participating in convergence research. GCR began by funding capacity- building activities to address grand challenges within NSF's Big Ideas. Exploratory Grants : GCR exploratory research grants enable research teams to: demonstrate their ability to collaborate effectively; resolve epistemological and ontological differences between disciplines; integrate conceptual models, tools, methodologies, and infrastructure; and show progress on their convergence research projects. Exploratory grants are expected to have budgets of up to $3.60 million and durations of up to five years. Exploratory grants will prepare research teams for larger scale convergence research awards through programs such as Science and Technology Centers, Engineering Research Centers, and NSF Research Traineeships. NSF announced the first exploratory grant opportunity in FY 2018. 6 In February 2019, NSF released a GCR solicitation, NSF 19- 551,7 which announced funding opportunities for FY 2019 and FY 2020. Enhanced Merit Review Process: An e nhanced merit review process is employed for convergence research projects. NSF identified a cadre of experienced convergence researchers using data- mining tools, the knowledge of program staff, and suggestions from learned societies to evaluate GCR resear ch projects. A diverse pool of researchers to participate were then invited in a College of Reviewers (CoR) , which is a group of about 100 distinguished researchers that enables NSF staff to recruit appropriate reviewers for convergence research and was used to review proposals submitted in response to the FY 2019 GCR solicitation. FY 2021 Investments Capacity -Building Activities: As part of catalyzing convergence, up to four capacity- building activities in emerging convergence research themes are anticip ated, each at up to $150,000. Exploratory Grants : Investments will focus on two phases : (1) catalyzing convergence of new teams at the intersection of existing disciplines (six to eight new research collaborations , each funded at up to $600,000 per year for the first two years); and (2) continuing support of teams funded in 2019 who have demonstrated significant progress on their convergence research projects.8 Enhanced Merit Review Process : Additional experts will be recruited to expand the Convergence CoR. 6 \"Dear Colleague Letter: Growing Convergence Research,\" (NSF 18 -058) www.nsf.gov/pubs/2018/nsf18058/nsf18058.jsp. This resulted in seven awards in FY 2018 and three in FY 2019. 7 www.nsf.gov/publications/pub_summ.jsp?WT.z_pims_id=505637&ods_key=nsf19551. In FY 2019, this led to 11 collaborative research project awards. 8 The second phase of proj ects will be funded up to $800,000 per year and may continue for up to three years pending successful yearly progress.

Broadening Participation (BP) in STEM Research : Synthesize and build the research base for broadening participation in STEM and foster the spread and adaptation of proven effective practices. 2. Shared Goals and Objectives: Support stakeholders as they identi fy shared goals and objectives, including those from specific STEM disciplines. 3. NSF INCLUDES National Network : Support local and regional, discipline -specific, and crosscutting, multi- stakeholder partnerships and networks as part of the NSF INCLUDES Natio nal Network. FY 2021 Investments In NSF plans to invest $18.92 million in NSF INCLUDES, all funded within EHR. Goal 1: Broadening Participation in STEM Research NSF INCLUDES will continue to fund BP projects and related research through NSF INC LUDES Alliances and NSF's existing BP portfolio,8 such as pilot projects, planning grants, supplements, and starter networks (e.g., research coordination networks) that serve as on -ramps to NSF INCLUDES Alliances and the NSF INCLUDES National Network. NSF INCLUDES also supports the dissemination and adaptation of proven strategies for expanding the use of innovative BP practices. Goal 2: Shared Goals and Objectives NSF will provide ongoing funding to the NSF INCLUDES Coordination Hub to oversee the implementation of a system of measurement, communication, and mutually reinforcing activities across the NSF INCLUDES National Network. NSF will support connections of existing NSF BP programs and other NSF -funded projects that support the NSF INCLUDES vision th rough the NSF INCLUDES National Network. NSF will develop a comprehensive evaluation, monitoring, and feedback framework implemented with the NSF INCLUDES Coordination Hub, with indicators and measures for tracking progress towards the achievement of the g oals of the NSF INCLUDES National Network and the NSF BP portfolio. Goal 3: NSF INCLUDES National Network NSF will fund NSF INCLUDES Alliances, which are five -year, center -scale projects committed to solving a specific set of objectives. FY 2021 funding w ill also provide ongoing support to the eight NSF INCLUDES Alliances funded in prior years. NSF will regularly convene principal investigators of NSF INCLUDES projects (virtually and face -to- face) to discuss BP challenges, proposed strategies, scaling mechanisms, common metrics, and the feasibility of sustaining projects. 7 NSTC (2018). Charting a Course for Success: America's Strategy for M -Plan -2018.pdf 8 (MID- RI (Dollars in Millions) 1 In FY 2021, The EPSCoR program will invest no less than an additional $20.0 million in Mid-scale RI within EPSCoR jurisdictions Overview The Mid-scale RI program is an NSF-wide effort to meet the research community's needs for modern research infrastructure to support priority science and engineering research. Mid-scale RI is an \"enabling\" Big Idea that implements agile mechanisms for funding experimental research capabilities costing between $6.0 million and $100.0 million. 1 The objective is to transform scientific and engineering research fields with new infrastructure, while simultaneously training early- career researchers in the development, design, construction, and use of cutting- edge infrastructure. The scientific importance of mid -scale research infrastructure is reflected in the 2017 American Innovation and Competitiveness Act (AICA) , which directed NSF to \"evaluate the existing and future needs, across all disciplines support ed by the Foundation, for mid- scale projects.\" NSF issued a Request for Information in late 2017 that resulted in nearly 200 ideas for research infrastructure with in a project cost range of $20 million to $100 million. Subsequently, FY 2018 appropriations report language directed the NSB to \"consider steps to bridge the gap between the NSF's Major Research Instrumentation (MRI) program and the agency's Major Research Equipment and Facility Construction (MREFC) account.\" Responding to this direction, the NSB report, \"Bridging the Gap: Building a Sustained Approach to Mid- scale Research Infrastructure and Cyberinfrastructure at NSF\" , 2 highlights that: \"The research community has identified mid -scale research infrastructure as a key enabler of scientific advances on shorter timescales than required for the larger projects funded within the MREFC account. ... Infrastructure investments at the required mid- level can also help maintain the United States' standing among global partners and competitors.\" 1 The NSF -established thresholds for Mid-scale Track -2 projects have been updated from prior presentations to align with the definitions in 24 The graphic above shows NSF -wide instrumentation and infrastructure programs. Information presented in this narrative focuses on the Mid-scale RI components , Mid -scale RI - scale RI -1) and Mid- scale RI - Track 2 (Mid -scale RI -2), whic h constitute the Mid -scale RI Big Idea. Information on the complementary MRI program may be found in the IA narrative, while information on major multi -user research facility construction projects may be found in the MREFC chapter. The Mid -scale RI program support s the implementation of research infrastructure at scales that are above what is possible through the MRI program and below what has previously been funded through the MREFC account. Mid -scale RI -2 awards will be funded by the MREFC account and are distinguished from Mid- scale RI -1 awards by the ir scale, potential risks, and the resulting NSF oversight. In FY 2019, NSF received proposals in response to two Mid-scale RI funding opportunities. O ne (Mid - scale RI -1, NSF -19-5373) include d an opportunity to propose Mid- scale RI implementation projects with a total NSF project cost between $6.0 million4 and $ 20.0 million, as well as infrastructure des ign projects with costs between $600,000 and $20.0 million, while a second (Mid -scale RI -2, NSF-19-5425) include d an opportunity to implement projects with a total NSF cost between $20.0 million and $70.0 million. NSF made ten Mid -scale RI -1 awards, includ ing the development of the first 1.2GHz nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR ) facility in the U.S., extremely fast and powerful lasers, a neutron spin echo spectrometer to be deployed at National Institute of Standards and Technology, and a testbed for experiments for future internet designs, as well as support for the design of a future experiment to study the cosmic microwave background. The first awards for Mid -scale RI -2 will be made in FY 2020. T he anticipated total number of Mid-scale RI -2 awards made as a result of the first competition is three to six. Goals 1. Provide access to cutting -edge mid -scale research in frastructure, including instrumentation . 2. Enable agile development and implementation of frontier scientific and engineering research infrastructure with a high potential to significantly advance the Nation's research capabilities. 3. Train early -career scientists and engineers in the development and use of advanced research infrastructure . FY 2021 Investments In FY 2021, NSF will invest a to tal of $117.67 million in Mid -scale RI , split between two tracks, million) and Mid-scale RI -2 ($65.0 million). Track 1 will be funded through the R&RA account, and Track 2 will be funded through the MREFC account. For Track 1, $32.67 million will be available for investment in projects in any jurisdiction, while no less than $20.0 million will be invested in EPSCoR jurisdictions. Subject to availability of funding in FY 2022, Mid- scale RI -1 funding will support an estimated seven to nine new awards in a funding cycle that will span FY 2021 and FY 2022. It is anticipated that Mid -scale RI -2 funding will provide support for projects funded as a result of the first Mid - scale RI -2 competition that will conclude during FY 2020. 3 www.nsf.gov/pubs/2019/nsf19537/nsf19537.htm 4 Design activities to bring Mid -scale or larger projects to readiness for implementation may request a minimum of $600,000. 5 www.nsf.gov/pubs/2019/nsf19542/nsf19542.htm NSF-Wide Investments - 25 ADVANCED MANUFACTURING FY 140.00 MPS 113.94 - 113.78 OISE - - 0.50 Total $297.85 - $302.85Advanced Manufacturing Funding (Dollars in Millions) Overview Manufacturing is essential to almost every sector of the U.S. economy, from medicine to information technology to transportation.

NSF-Wide Investments - 27 ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE (AI) FY 2019 in Millions) 1Includes $30.0 million, split evenly between CISE and ENG, for AI-related research activities in the HDR and FW-HTF Big Ideas. For more information, see the individual Big Idea narratives in this chapter. Overview AI is advancing rapidly and holds the potential to vastly transform our lives. NSF has a long and rich history of supporting transformative research in AI, along with the closely related areas of data science and robotics . For example, NSF -funded researchers in the 1990s began working on what is now known as collaborative filtering. Today, collaborative filtering fuels the recommender engines on popular websites like Netflix and Amazon - the \"you might also like\" suggestions that propel a significant proportion of e -commerce activity. Similarly, NSF investments in understanding learning across the lifespan, in different species and contexts, have contributed to today's deep learning systems. Today, NSF supports fundamental research, education and workforce development, and access to data and advanced computing research infrastructure that collectively enhance AI . NSF's ability to bring together numerous fields of scientific inquiry\u2014 including computer and information science ; cognitive science and psychology ; economics and game theory ; engineering and control theory ; ethics; linguistics ; mathematics ; and philosophy\u2014 uniquely positions the agency to lead the N ation in expanding the frontiers of AI. In FY 2021, NSF will increase support for foundational research in AI, including machine learning (ML) and deep learning, natural language technologies , knowledge representa tion and reasoning, and computer vision, along with the safety, security, robustness, and explainability of AI systems. In addition to foundational research in these areas, NSF also supports translational research that links AI innovation with science and the economy, including agriculture, manufacturing, transportation, and health . Equally important is NSF's investment in education and learning, which grow s the human capital and institutional capacity needed to nurture the next generation of AI researchers and practitioners. Finally, advances in AI rely upon access to data as well as NSF-funded advanced computing research infrastructure . Through collaboration and coordination with the Office of Science and Technology Policy, NSF leadership is helping to dr ive and coordinate AI R&D efforts across the federal government. For example, the NSF Director co -chairs the National Science and Technology Council's Select Committee on AI, which advises the White House on interagency AI R&D priorities and establishes st ructures to improve government planning and coordination. In June 2019, the Select Committee issued an update to the 2016 National Artificial Intelligence Research and Development Strategic Plan 1 that identified eight strategic priorities and provided a coordinated federal strategy for AI R&D that will help the United States continue to lead 1 www.nitrd.gov/pubs/National -AI-RD-Strategy -2019.pdf Artificial Intelligence NSF-Wide Investments - 28 the world in cutting- edge advances in AI that will grow the economy, increase our national security, and improve quality of life. The goals outlined below directly address many of these strategic priorities. Goals 1.

NSF will continue investments in robotics and autonomous systems that exhibit signif icant levels of both computational capability and physical complexity, including research related to the design, application, and use of robotics to augment human function, promote human- robot interaction, and increase robot autonomy. Goal 2 : Education and Workforce Development As part of the National AI Research Institutes program as discussed above , NSF plans to fund an AI Research Institute in Augmented Learning in FY 2020 at up to $20.0 million over five years . AI- Augmented Learning include s AI -driven innovations to radically improve human learning and education writ large \u2014in formal settings (e.g., preK -12, undergraduate, graduate, vocational education) ; training, on- the-job and across the lifespan ; as well as informal settings (e.g., museum s, nature centers, libraries; TV/film; crowd -sourcing and citizen science; on- line experiences). In support of the 2019 Federal Cybersecurity Research and Development Strategic Plan ,2 and the Presidential Executive Order on America's Cybersecurity Workforce,3 NSF will address a critical shortage of cybersecurity educators and researchers in priority areas including the cybersecurity aspects of AI, through the NSF CyberCorps\u00ae: Scholarship for Service program . In FY 2021, the NSF Graduate Research Fellowship Program (GRFP) will encourage applications from students wanting to conduct AI -related research. The NSF GRFP recognizes and supports outstanding graduate students in NSF -supported STEM disciplines who are pursuing research -based master's and doctoral degrees at accredited United States institutions . The NSF Research Traineeship (NRT) program advances graduate edu cation by combining interdisciplinary training with innovative professional development activities to educate the next generation of scientists and engineers capable of solving convergent research problems in areas of national need. In FY 2021, NRT will ex pand to include a special on traineeships in AI . In FY 2021, NSF will continue support at the K -12 and undergraduate levels for enhancing the core computer science (CS) and computational thinking (CT) competencies necessary for the next generation of AI researchers and practitioners. For example, NSF's Computer Science for All: Researcher Practitioner Partnerships program will support research and partnership efforts to provide all U.S. students the opportunity to participate in CS and CT education in their schools at the preK -12 levels. Likewise, the Improving Undergraduate STEM Education: Computing in Undergraduate Education program will support teams of Institutions of Higher Education (IHEs) in re -envisioning the role of computing in interdisciplin ary collaboration within their institutions. NSF will also encourage partnering IHEs to integrate the study of ethics into their efforts . Goal 3 : Access to Data and Advanced Computing Research Infrastructure NSF supports a range of advanced computing syst ems and services for the full range of computational - and data -intensive research across all areas of science and engineering, including AI. For example, in September 2019, Frontera, the largest and most powerful supercomputer NSF has ever supported , came online to serve the N ation's science and engineering research community. The system , located at the University of Texas at Austin 's Texas Advanced Computing Center and named the fifth fastest supercomputer in the world , will enable access to advanced computing resources for AI research. NSF will continue these investments in - In FY 2019, NSF put in place a five-year cooperative agreement for $5.0 million with the University of California -San Diego, University of California -Berkeley, and University of Washington for the establishment and operat ion of CloudBank, a n entity that will help the computer science community access and use public clouds for research and education by delivering a set of managed services designed to simplify access to public clouds. CloudBank will specifically enable new research in AI by broade ning the access and impact of cloud computing across the many fields of computer science research and education . For FY 2021, NSF will continue to coll aborate with other federal agencies to enable researcher access to deep, high- quality, and accurate federal training datasets. Goal 4: Public -Private Partnerships In FY 2021, pursuant to the other three goals described above, NSF will continue to engag e other stakeholders in its portfolio of AI research, education, and infrastructure investments . Specifically, NSF will place a priority on developing partnerships with other federal agencies, like-minded international funders , and especially the private sector, including private industry, foundations, and nonprofits, as an increasingly important means to maximize the scientific, economic, and societal impacts of its investments. A key focal point of the public -private partnerships in AI research, education, and research infrastructure will be via the National AI Research Institutes program , enabling large -scale, long -time- horizon challenges in areas of national importance . NSF-Wide Investments - 31 QUANTUM INFORMATION SCIENCE (QIS) FY 2019 ActualFY 2020 (TBD)FY - 14.60 ENG 10.19 - - - MPS 82.50 - 180.80 SBE 0.30 - - Total $106.14 - $226.36Quantum Information Science Funding1 (Dollars in Millions) 1 Funding for QIS and QL overlaps in some areas. Thus, it should not be summed across presentations. Overview Research in Quantum Information Science (QIS) will advance fundamental understanding of uniquely quantum phenomena that can be harnessed to promote information processing, transmission, and measurement in ways that classical approaches do less efficiently, or not at all. Current and future QIS applications differ from prior applications of quantum mechanics, such as lasers, transistors, and magnetic resonance imaging, by using distinct quantum phenomena \u2014superposition and entanglement \u2014that do not have classical counterparts. The development of these new applications will form the basis of one of the major technological revolutions of the 21 st century. Building upon more than two decades of exploratory discovery, NSF investment in QIS will help propel the Nation forward as a leading developer of quantum technology. These investments are a key component of the A dministration's National Quantum Initiative (NQI) to coordinate and expand America's world -leading position in fundamental quantum research. An effective national strategy for QIS requires u se of the full spectrum of talent cross the Nation . In addition, international cooperation with like -minded countries is critical to ensure that discoveries, and their resulting technologies, provide for economic growth and national security. F oundational activities that serve as idea factories will continue to be supported . There will also be special stewardship activities targeting all major area s of computers, communications, sensors, and networking. Special attention as to how these areas connect with each other will accelerate development in all of them and lead to advances in quantum computers, quantum communications networks, quantum sensors that enhance resolution and detection capabilities significantly, and networks that can connect components of quantum systems without loss of fidelity. Continued investments will be made to leverage our understanding of quantum phenomena observed in nature to enable bioinspired design of novel sensing and computing devices. Outreach to fields beyond the core of QIS will identify end users of this new technology and help establish the market for new tools and applications from security to biomedical . Ultim ately, this work will allow quantum technology to become established on a sound footing and play a recognizable role in the US economy. Goals 1. Answer key science and engineering questions in order to facilitate the translation of fundamental knowledge into technological applications . 2. Deliver proof -of-concept devices, applications, tools, or systems with a demonstrable quantum advantage over their classical counterparts that will form the basis of a revolutionary 21 st century technology. Quantum Information Science NSF-Wide Investments - 32 3. Empow er the full spectrum of talent to which NSF has access to build the capacity necessary to achieve goals one and two and generate the quantum -literate workforce that will implement the results of these breakthroughs. FY 2021 Investments Workforce Develo pment : The development of a broad -based, diverse workforce is a primary. Proposed activities include: (1) expansion of the highly successful joint industry -academia graduate program to additional hubs; (2) support for Research Experience for Undergraduate s sites and supplements to existing awards dedicated to quantum; ( 3) support for summer schools and targeted programs to expand participation across the Nation , especially to groups and geographic locations that are n ot currently heavily involved ; (4) support for a faculty fellow s program to grow capacity in the computer science community related to quantum computing ; and (5) s upport for personnel exchange with international partners . Centers: NSF will continue its investment in the quantum foundries and Quantum Leap Challenge Institutes initiated in FY 2020 and add additional Quantum Leap Chall enge Institutes following a second round of competition in FY 2021. Institutes will seek industry partnerships as well as like-minded international partners whose investments complement our own. Quantum Simulators : Development and use of quantum simulators has promise for connecting quantum developers with communities that have extensive computational needs. Earlier NSF investment in quantum simulators has resulted in several promising directions that are ready for further exploitation. NSF would enable this through a meta -program, a convergent approach that has proven to have enhanced flexibility in making real -time adjustments to accommodate new areas of science. Quantum Sensors : Quantum sensors offer the most recognized near -term end -user applications of second- generation quantum technologies. Potential users cover the scientific spectrum , from precision measurements in physics to high- resolution imaging in biology to seismology in earth sciences. Exploiting the potential offered by quantum -based sensors relies on establishing close connections between the builders and the users. NSF would achieve this through a series of Research Coordination Networks and \"Dear Colleague\" lette rs emphasizing areas of mutual interest . Quantum Interconnects : While the exact implementation of quantum processing nodes and qubits is still the topic of research and debate, the information between the quantum processing nodes will most likely be car ried by photons. Therefore, interfacing different types of qubits with photons is critical for the realization of scalable distributed quantum computational systems as well as for coherent connections between quantum platforms dedicated to computing , communication , and /or sensing. NSF will support convergent and cross -disciplinary teams of engineers, computer scientists, and physical scientists to develop basic research results that enable emerging quantum computing systems to interface with each other as well as with existing traditional computing systems. Quantum Computing: Much progress has been made in superconducting and ion- trap quantum compu ting architectures, and NSF continues to invest in ways to scale these by at least a factor of ten or more. However, there is yet no single platform that has emerged as the leading contender , and multiple architectures might simultaneously co- exist to support distinct types of quantum computations enable d by each . NSF will continue exploring alternative quantum computing architectures that could emerge as viable options in the future as well as the basic underpinnings and limits of quantum computing as defi ned by the underlying physical processes and architectures. At the same time, in collaboration with industry, NSF will support researcher access to quantum systems and platforms to experiment in specific domain s. NSF-Wide Investments - 33 SPECTRUM INNOVATION INITIATIVE (SII) FY 2019 ActualFY 2020 (TBD)FY 2021 Request Stewardship Activities (MPS) - - $17.00SII Funding (Dollars in Millions) Overview The electromagnetic spectrum plays a crucial role in many ways for the United States, including scientific investigation of the world around us, public safety and security, and the provision of a tremendous range of commercial services and products. The objective of the SII is to expand upon NSF's portfolio in this area to promote dynamic and agile electromagnetic spectrum utilization, while ensuring innovation and security for all users , including for both new active spectrum applications and for spectrum used for non- communication purposes . Reaching this objective will require basic research, infrastructure development, new collaborations, public outreach, education and workforce development. Goals As demands for spectrum availability have increased, the need to more efficiently and robustly use this limited natural resource to meet multiple goals has also increased. An increasing demand for broadband services, such as the coming 5G and beyond networks, and the need for a spectrum supply necessary for scientific research, such as atmospheric modeling, are two of the major sources of demand for spectrum availability, and innovation is required to solve the challenge of achieving the most efficient spectrum utilization for these and other purposes . While NSF has supported successful spectrum research activities for many years, the SII represents an increased and sustained commitment on a larger and more interdisciplinary scale . This initiative will result in increased industry, research, and societal capabilities through more efficient use of the electromagnetic frequency spectrum. Enhancing efficient spectrum utilization and access is vital to the national interest, including both the scientific enterprise and industries of the future. The primary goals of the SII include the following: 1. Develop the concept and infrastructure for Nati onal Radio Dynamic Zones, which can be used for testing of dynamic spectrum utilization techniques while minimizing regulatory hurdles that slow innovation. 2. Establish and sustain an interdisciplinary National Center for Wireless Spectrum Research , which wi ll bring teams of scientists, engineers, computer scientists, and social scientists together to innovate, developing new solutions that enable more efficient use of the electromagnetic spectrum. 3. Integrate the National Radio Dynamic Zones and the National C enter for Wireless Spectrum Research with the frontier research currently being conducted through other NSF programs and facilities . Those programs include the NSF -industry partnership in Platforms for Advanced Wireless Research (PAWR) , the Spectrum and Wi reless Innovation enabled by Future Technologies (SWIFT) program , and NSF facilities performing cutting edge scientific research such as the Green Bank Observatory , the National Radio Astronomy Observatory, and the National Center for Atmospheric Research . 4. Develop the workforce needed to research and implement the dynamic and agile spectrum utilization techniques that will secure access to the spectrum for receive- only systems and enable the broadband applications of the future. 5. Develop increased public awa reness of the scarcity of the electromagnetic spectrum resource, and the challenges associated with its scarcity and its efficient use. Spectrum Innovation Initiative NSF-Wide Investments - 34 FY 2021 Investments Investments in FY 2021 include the following: National Radio Dynamic Zones ($9.40 million) : This investment includes enhancements in active electromagnetic spectrum management efforts at NSF's major research facilities ($1.40 million) as well as computing infrastructure and hardware research and development to support the National Radio Dynamic Zones ($8.0 million).

Workforce development and public outreach ($1.0 million) : The investment in workforce development will include fellowships associated with the above efforts and research funded through SWIFT and PAWR, as well as Research Experiences for Undergraduates . The public outreach efforts will include supplements to exis ting awards that enable enhanced public awareness of the electromagnetic spectrum and the challenges associated with its scarcity and its efficient use. These investments represent a new cross- disciplinary, NSF -wide focus on spectrum innovation. NSF-Wide Investments - 35 NSF INNOVATION CORPS (I -CORPS) FY ENG 17.33 - GEO 0.60 - 0.60 MPS 1.70 - 1.61 SBE 0.50 - 0.47 Total $32.82 - $31.42I-Corps Funding (Dollars in Millions) Overview The NSF Innovation Corps (I -Corps) program connects NSF -funded science and engineering research with the technological, entrepreneurial, and business communities, fostering a national innovation ecosystem that links scientific discovery with technology development, societal needs, and economic opportunities. The goal of the I-Corps program , created in 2011 by NSF, is to reduce the time and risk associated with translating promising ideas and technologies from the laboratory to the marketplace. The I-Corps curriculum uses experiential learning of customer and industry discovery, coupled with first - hand investigation of industrial processes, to quickly assess the translational potential of inventions. The program is designed to support the commercialization of deep technologies, or those revolving a round fundamental discoveries in science and engineering. The I-Corps program address es the skill and knowledge gap associated with the transformation of basic research into deep technology ventures. In 2017, the American Innovation and Competitiveness A ct (AICA, Public Law 114 -329, Sec. 601) formally authorized NSF to carry out, further develop, and expand the I -Corps program and other training programs that focus on education in entrepreneurship and commercialization. In the program's initial phase, I-Corps Nodes and Sites were funded separately to serve as the backbone of the National Innovation Network (NIN). Informed by community feedback and lessons learned over its first eight years , the I-Corps program is creat ing a new phase of the NIN anchored by I -Corps Hubs that will begin in FY 2020.1 Hubs are designed to be capable of more integrated, sustained operation at the scope and scale required to support the expansion of the NSF I -Corps program as directed by A ICA. This new model will fund Hubs that are envisioned as centers of I -Corps entrepreneurial training and research activities and that represent integration of the existing Nodes and Sites. Any college or university in the country will be able to engage w ith I-Corps activities through one of these Hubs , expanding access to NIN for teams throughout the country. In alignment with the Administration's priority crosscutting action to build, strengthen, and expand strategic multisector partnerships, the NIN supports innovation research and education, and enhances the development of technologies, products, and processes that benefit society. NIN participants are diverse in research ar eas, resources, tools, programs, capabilities, and geographic locations, and the network has the flexibility to grow or reconfigure as needs evolve. These components contribute to enhancing and enlarging the NIN's community of mentors, researchers, entrepr eneurs, and investors. 1 www.nsf.gov/funding/pgm_summ.jsp?pims_id=505760&org=NSF NSF Innovation Corps NSF-Wide Investments - 36 The I -Corps program supports NSF's strategic vision of \"a Nation that is the global leader in research and innovation.\" Specifically, I -Corps contributes directly to strategic objectives in NSF's FY 2018 - FY 2022 Strategic Plan, in cluding Objective 1.1, to \"advance knowledge through investments in ideas, people, and infrastructure\"; Objective 2.1, to \"support research and promote partnerships to accelerate innovation and to provide new capabilities to meet pressing societal needs\"; and Objective 2.2, to \"foster the growth of a more capable and diverse research workforce and advance the scientific and innovation skills of the Nation.\" Goals The specific goals of the I -Corps program are to: 1. Capitalize on NSF's investment in fundame ntal research and identify, develop, and support promising ideas with commercial potential . 2. Create and implement tools, resources , and training activities that offer academic researchers an opportunity to learn first -hand about technology- based innovation and entrepreneurship. 3. Connect academic researchers with entrepreneurship resources, industrial mentors, startup investors, and peers conducting translational research and commercialization. 4. Provide diverse communities of student innovators with real-world knowledge through curricul um and first-hand participation in transforming scientific and engineering discoveries to meet societal needs. 5. Share and leverage effective innovation practices on a national scale to improve the quality of life for all Americans. FY 2021 Investments The new phase of the I -Corps program has two components: I-Corps Teams are funded at $50,000 per Team with a duration of six months. NSF currently funds approximately 240 teams per year. NSF will grow the number of Teams trained through partnerships with other federal agencies and programs, states, and regional organizations. New I -Corps Hubs will be supported for up to five years, funded at up to $3.0 million per year . NSF will continue to pursue potential scaling , through the I-Corps Hubs introduced in FY 2020 and other means. This strategy calls for new mechanisms to provide I -Corps curriculum and experience to a much larger community of technology innovators and entrepreneurs, particularly those without prior connections with NSF and who may not otherwise have access to the I -Corps curriculum. The expanded community will include local and regional entreprene urs, university spinoffs, and awardees of other federal agencies, state governments, and non- profit organizations. By leveraging existing entrepreneurial and innovation capacities in universities and tapping into federal, state, and regional resources, the I-Corps NIN holds significant potential to reach a larger number of budding and existing innovators and entrepreneurs. NSF will continue to build NIN partnerships with stakeholders, including federal agencies, state governments, universities, and non- profit organizations. Current partnerships with the Department of Energy and the National Institutes of Health are outlined in the first AICA I -Corps report. 2 NSF also has Memoranda of Understanding in place with the U.S. Department of Agriculture, Depart ment of Defense, Advanced Research Projects Agency -Energy , Department of Homeland Security, and National Aeronautics and Space Administration. E ach of these agencies support s the participation of its researchers in the NSF - operated I -Corps Teams training program. In FY 2019, NSF entered into a cooperative agreement with the National GEM Consortium3 to promote inclusive and diverse participation in I -Corps. 2 www.nsf.gov/news/special_reports/i -corps/pdf/I -CorpsReport --6_4_19FINAL_508.pdf 3 www.gemfellowship.org/ ActualFY 3.03 MPS 1.70 - 0.95 SBE 4.00 - 3.80 Total $134.50 - $124.91SaTC Funding (Dollars in Millions) Overview In today's increasingly networked, distributed, and asynchronous world, society is deeply reliant on the smooth functioning of its digital infrastructure \u2014and the security of that infrastructure (also known as cybersecurity ) involves hardware, software, networks, data, people, and integration with the physical world. Recent events have exposed the dual nature of cyberspace: while it is an unprecedented sourc e of innovation, efficiency, and growth, it also brings the potential for attacks on enterprises, loss of privacy, and even erosion of trust in democratic institutions. Indeed, key components of the digital infrastructure were not designed to operate in a hostile environment with intentional adversaries. Achieving a truly secure and trustworthy cyberspace therefore requires addressing not only challenging scientific and engineering problems involving many components of a complex system, but also issues that arise from human behaviors and choices. Examining the fundamental principles of security and privacy as a multidisciplinary subject constitutes a promising approach to develop better ways to design, build, and operate cyber systems; to protect existing and future infrastructure; and to motivate and educate individuals about cybersecurity. Achieving these goals not only requires expertise in computer science, engineering, statistics, mathematics, social, behavioral, and economic sciences, and education research, but also the translation of new concepts and technologies into practice. SaTC is a multi- year investment area that began in FY 2012 and continuously evolves to address new threats. SaTC is aligned with the 2019 Federal Cybersecurity Research and Dev elopment Strategic Plan, 1 which was developed pursuant to the Cybersecurity Enhancement Act of 2014 (P.L. 113- 274), and the Presidential Executive Order on Strengthening the Cybersecurity of Federal Networks and Critical Infrastructure .2 Outcomes from SaTC include an organized scientific body of knowledge that informs the theory and practice of cybersecurity and privacy and an improved understanding of the causes of and mitigations for current threats. SaTC contributes to the development of foundational countermeasure techniques leveraging sound mathematical and scientific foundations, principled design methodologies, and socio -technical approaches that consider human, social, organizational, economic, and technical factors, as well as design metrics for evaluating success or failure of these approaches. In the space of training and education, SaTC makes recommendations for new instructional materials, degree programs, and educational pathways . Ultimately, through SaTC, NSF funds a broad and deep multidisciplinary research and education portfolio spanning cybersecurity and privacy, whose results underlie methods for securing critical infrastructure. Further, N SF expects to produce an innovation ecosystem that ensures (a) new and existing technologies are secure from both current threats and potential future threats as technologies evolve , and (b) users' information is protected from violations of privacy despit e new attack surfaces that 1 www.whitehouse.gov/the and Trustworthy Cyberspace NSF-Wide Investments - 38 these technologies may present. Similarly, the development of an American workforce and citizenry with an understanding of cybersecurity and privacy issues is a key benefit of NSF's support in this area. As the goals of SaTC cont ribute to national security, NSF plans to continue investments in this area for the foreseeable future. Importantly, SaTC also supports cybersecurity and privacy for the Industries of the Future (IoTF) through research investments, for example, in threat s and countermeasures in the context of advanced wireless networks; artificial intelligence (AI) as a tool for cybersecurity; security of AI and machine learning (ML) systems, including adversarial ML; and the implications of quantum computing for security, including post - quantum cryptography. Goals 1. Foundational Research: Develop the scientific theory, methodologies, and tools necessary for the development of trustworthy and usably secure systems and appropriate privacy safeguards that account for the rol e of human behavior and decision- making. 2. Accelerating Transition to Practice (TTP) : Transition successful fundamental research results and innovations into early adoption and use , and allow NSF cyberinfrastructure to serve as a premier proving ground and state -of-the-art environment for advancing cybersecurity solutions and moving them in to technical and organizational practice. 3. Education and Preparation of Cybersecurity Researchers and Professionals : Increase the number of qualified American students who pursue degrees in cybersecurity and privacy, and enhance the capacity of institutions of higher education to produce professionals in these fields to meet the needs of our increasingly digital society. This goal also includes NSF's investment in the CyberCorps \u00ae: Scholarship for Service (SFS) program. FY 2021 Investments Goal 1: Foundational Research NSF will issue a revised SaTC solicitation for FY 2021 that is aligned with the 2019 Federal Cybersecurity Research and Development Strategic Plan . Through this revised solicitation, NSF will continue to fund innovative projects that advance the science of cybersecurity and privacy, with emphases on: architectures and technologies for protecting cyberspace from increasingly sophisticated connected devices; security and privacy aspects of smart infrastructure including the Internet of T hings , and security and privacy for IoTF as described above . NSF will continue its efforts to grow the cybersecurity research community to include more researchers who cross the boundaries between computer and information science, engineering, the social, behavioral, and economic sciences, mathematics, statistics, and education research. In support of this specific aim, NSF will hold a range of workshops on cutting- edge topics . For example, NSF plan s to develop a series of workshops and summer schools that will explore the role of security in the quantum computing era. In FY 2021, NSF plans to fund a SaTC Research Coordination Network (RCN) on propagation of information in cyberspace and methods of re liably detecting \"deep fakes\" and inferring provenance of such misinformation, especially in the context of images, audio , and video. Goal 2: Accelerating Transition to Practice NSF will continue its focus on transitioning to practice research results tha t are ready for experimental deployment, early adoption, commercial innovation, and/or implementation in cyberinfrastructure. NSF will also continue to support research infrastructure in security and privacy in conjunction with the CISE Community Research Infrastructure program . FY 2021 Budget Request to Congress NSF-Wide Investments - 39 In FY 2021, NSF plans to develop an industry -academi a RCN, separate from the one described above, to foster stronger collaboration between academic researchers and industry. Goal 3: Education and Preparation of Cybersecurity Resea rchers and Professionals In alignment with the Presidential Executive Order on Strengthening the Cybersecurity of Federal Networks and Critical Infrastructure , NSF will continue the focus on cybersecurity education in FY 2021, with the aim s of building and sustaining an American cybersecurity workforce that is unrivaled in its ability to develop secure cyberinfrastructure components and systems, and raising the awareness of cybersecurity challenges across the entire American population. CyberCorps\u00ae: SFS will prioritize investments in K -12 education with the aim of growing interest in cybersecurity careers, promoting foundational cybersecurity principles and safe online behavior, improving teaching methods for delivering cybersecurity topics within computer science curricula, and promoting teacher recruitment in the field of cybersecurity. NSF will encourage and incentivize SFS institutions to participate in task forces on the cybersecurity workforce at the state level and explore possible private -publi c partnerships. SFS will support innovative approaches to workforce re -skilling, apprenticeships, cooperative learning opportunities, and practice -oriented models for training. In support of the 2019 Federal Cybersecurity Research and Development Strategi c Plan and the Presidential Executive Order on America's Cybersecurity Workforce , 3 SFS will address a critical shortage of cybersecurity educators and researchers including in priority areas such as the cybersecurity aspects of AI, quantum information science , and advanced networks . 3 www.whitehouse.gov/presidential -actions/executive-order -americas -cybersecurity -workforce/ FY 2019 ActualFY 2020 (TBD)FY EHR 89.99 - 74.09 ENG 0.53 - 4.43 GEO 6.00 - 5.42 OPP - - 0.46 Total $101.94 - $88.21IUSE Funding (Dollars in Millions) Overview High -quality undergraduate STEM education is essential for preparing the diverse STEM workforce needed to sustain U.S. leadership in innovation.1,2 It is also essential for producing STEM -knowledgeable workers who can use STEM skills in business and industry, as well as a STEM- literate public that understands and benefits from STEM.3 Thus , the Improving Undergraduate STEM Education (IUSE) program aims to ensure that every college student in the United States has exceptional STEM learning opportunities. To achieve this goal , the NSF -wide IUSE initiative supports research and development projects to improve undergraduate STEM education at multiple scales, rangin g from individual STEM classrooms to nationwide efforts. IUSE also supports innovative undergraduate STEM education to prepare the STEM workforce in emerging and interdisciplinary areas, such as computational and data -enabled science and engineering. All I USE projects include research and assessment components, and thus also contribute new knowledge about effective teaching and learning practices in undergraduate STEM education that can guide future innovations. IUSE is one of NSF's most flexible funding p rograms, which continues to support Administration priorities to build and leverage a diverse, highly skilled workforce. In addition to supporting projects that have specific relevance to any NSF -supported discipline , it also supports projects that span al l STEM disciplines. Examples of such cross -cutting efforts include incorporating active learning, increasing access to undergraduate research experiences, and developing cyberlearning courses and curricula. This flexibility enables IUSE to respond rapidly to emerging areas and priorities. For example, IUSE contributes to the Data Science Corps (DSC) program within the HDR Big Idea. HDR -DSC supports projects that engage students in solving data science challenges faced by communities, organizations, and governmental agencies. Thus, DSC leverages undergraduate data science education in service to science and society, contributing to a strong national data science infrastructure and workforce. 1 National Science Board (2018).

NSF-Wide Investments - 41 IUSE was initiated as a multi -year, NSF -wide priority investment a rea, spanning FY 2014 to FY 2020. The NSF 2018- 2022 Strategic Plan extended the initiative through FY 2022, thus enabling NSF to support ongoing innovations that will ensure that the undergraduate STEM education enterprise in the United States remains curr ent with advances in STEM and STEM education. Assessment of the IUSE portfolio will inform decisions about continuing the program beyond FY 2022. However, we anticipate that IUSE will continue as the principal component of NSF's undergraduate education str ategies for the foreseeable future. Goals IUSE aims to support improvements in undergraduate STEM e ducation across the Nation by funding research, development, and implementation efforts that will: 1. Improve undergraduate STEM le arning and learning environment \u2014Investments will improve the knowledge base for innovative undergraduate STEM instruction ; 2. Broaden participation and institutional capacity for undergraduate STEM learning\u2014 Investments will increase the number and diversity of undergraduate stud ents in STEM majors and career pathways; and 3. Build the STEM workforce for tomorrow \u2014Investments will advance the preparation of undergraduate students to be productive members of the future STEM and STEM -capable workforce. FY 2021 Investments As part of its mission to advance STEM, NSF plans to invest $ 88.21 million in FY 202 1. The IUSE initiative's anchor investment is made by IUSE /EHR, a solicitation -based program in EHR 's Division of Undergraduate Education. IUSE /EHR supports research- based activities such as the use of inquiry- based and active learning approaches in undergraduate instruction, increasing undergraduate research experiences and courses, and research on the persistence and graduation of students in STEM programs. IUSE /EHR is complemented b y five additional IUSE core programs, which share the three common IUSE goals listed in the previous section but have a narrower funding focus than IUSE /EHR : EHR/IUSE: Hispanic Serving Institutions (HSI) Program : Supports improvements in retention and graduation rates at HSIs that have not received high levels of NSF support; approximately 15 awards. BIO/IUSE: Research Coordination Networks/Undergraduate Biology Education (RCN -UBE ): Supports collaborative networks to improve undergraduate biology education; approximately 10 awards. ENG/IUSE: Professional Formation of Engineers (IUSE/PFE:RED) : Supports organizational change strategies to transform undergraduate engineering education; approximately six awards. CISE/IUSE: Computing in Undergraduate Ed ucation (I ISE:CUE) : Supports multi- institution teams to re-envision the role of comput er science in undergraduate education to better prepare a wider, more diverse range of students and to integrate the study of ethics into computer science curricula; approximately 14 awards. GEO/IUSE: Pathways into the Earth, Ocean, Polar, and Atmospheric & Geospace Sciences (IUSE:GEOPATHS) : GEO support s strategies to increase the number and diversity of undergraduate students pursuing geoscience degrees; approximately 20 awards. IUSE funding is intended to help move the Nation forward in achieving the vision of an undergraduate STEM education enterprise in which every undergraduate becomes STEM knowledgeable and every student who desires to do so can pursue a STEM educati on that maximizes their full potential for a STEM career. NSF-Wide Investments - 42 MAJOR INVESTMENTS IN SCIENCE, TECHNOLOGY, ENGINEERING, AND MATHEMATICS (STEM) GRADUATE STUDENTS AND GRADUATE EDUCATION Overview A U.S. science, technology, engineering, and mathematics workforce with advanced preparation in research and innovation, and in professional fields such as cybersecurity and STEM teaching, is essential for the progress of science and engineering (S&E). Today, emerging fields of S&E increasingly demand collaborations that span institutions, disciplines, and national boundaries, and require the use of sophisticated data infrastructure, instruments, and networks of researchers. Computationally intensive and data-enabled science in areas such as artificial intelligence and quantum information science is dramatically changing the knowledge and experience required of researchers and other STEM professionals across all fields. Thus, the preparation of graduate students in STEM must continue to evolve to provide a supply of scientists and engineers who not only meet the ne eds of the STEM enterprise, but who also have the knowledge, skills, and preparation to advance it and lead innovation in academia and the private and public sectors. Investing in discoverers \u2014that is, building a diverse and talented next -generation of STE M research leaders and professionals in leading -edge scientific areas, across sectors and through inclusive processes \u2014is an important NSF focus and aligns with Administration and Congressional priorities. A major portion of NSF's overall investment in graduate education and graduate students supports research assistants funded through research grants. The Division of Gradu ate Education (DGE) also supports graduate students through other mechanisms such as traineeships, scholarships and fellowships. Goals The goal of NSF's investments in STEM graduate education and STEM graduate students is to prepare a diverse workforce with advanced research training that is equipped to transform the frontiers of S&E , and to prepare professionals to participate and innova te in STEM intensive careers. This goal is based on the following framework 1 to: 1. Advance Science and Engineering Research : Support graduate students and graduate education to enable long- term contributions of new knowledge at the frontiers of science and engineering. 2. Broaden Participation to Promote Excellence in Research and Build the Next Generation STEM Workforce: Recruit graduate students from a variety of geographic, demographic, social, and educational backgrounds to promote the advancement of scien ce and a highly qualified professional workforce. 3. Build Effective Models of Graduate Education and Workforce Development : Support the development and use of innovative models and evidence -based approaches in graduate education, including education and res earch about promising practices and program effectiveness. FY 2021 Investments NSF's two major agency- wide programs in graduate education are the NSF Research Traineeship (NRT) program and the Graduate Research Fellowship Program (GRFP). EHR's Division of Graduate Education leads management for both programs. NSF -wide working groups guide the administration of these programs. Both programs contain design elements recommended in major national reports 2 as ways to 1 National Science Foundation (2016). NSF Strategic Framework for Investments in Graduate Education.

Graduate STEM Education in the 21st Century. Washington, FY 2021 Budget Request to Congress NSF-Wide Investments - 43 better prepare graduates for a broad range of careers. The NRT has two complementary components: (1) training grants that focus on developing researchers in high priority interdisciplinary research areas ; and 2) the Innovations in Graduate Education (IGE) research program through the initiation of research on the development and implementation of bold, new, and potentially transformative approaches to STEM graduate education and training. GRFP identifies and supports the next generation of outstanding STEM researchers. Both programs provide profess ional development opportunities for graduate students, including internships and international research experiences. Ongoing evaluation and monitoring of the programs and students involved in NRT and GRFP provide rich data that will be used for gaining a better understanding of graduate program experiences and interventions, monitoring career outcomes longitudinally, and contributing to improving the understanding of STEM professional workforce development. There are several other programs at NSF that focu s on developing sectors of the STEM workforce and provide support to students in testing new models and approaches to graduate education. For example, the CyberCorps\u00ae: Scholarship for Service (SFS) program, led by EHR, addresses the national need for a cybersecurity workforce. The Robert Noyce Teacher Scholarship program (Noyce) provides fellowship support to members of the master teacher cohort at the graduate level and funds innovation and development in STEM teacher education approaches. The Louis Stokes Alliances for Minority Participation's Bridge to the Doctorate (LSAMP -BD) track and NSF Scholarships in Science, Technology, Engineering, and Mathematics (S -STEM) support the successful entry and transition of underrepresented and underserved populations into STEM graduate education and into the STEM workforce. This broad suite of programs contributes substantially to the NSF investment in graduate education of the STEM research and education workforce of the future. NSF Research Traineeship The goals of NRT are to support highly effective training of STEM graduate students in interdisciplinary research areas of national priority, as well as to create and promote innovative, effective, and scalable models for STEM graduate student training. In FY 2021, NRT will expand to include a special focus on traineeships in artificial intelligence and artificial intelligence engineering. The NRT program is distinguished by its emphasis on training for multiple career pathways, rotating priority research themes with an emphasis on future scientific challenges, inclusion of both masters and doctoral students, and availability of the training components to both NRT -funded students and other graduate students who may want to take advantage of the se training o pportunities. NRT addresses interdisciplinary graduate education through two approaches: traineeships and fundamental education research. Traineeships are dedicated to effective training of STEM graduate students in high -priority interdisciplinary research areas using a comprehensive training model that is innovative, evidence- based, and aligned with changing workforce and research needs. This training includes development of technical and professional skills for both research and research- related careers w ithin and outside academia. Fundamental education research is addressed through the Innovations in Graduate Education (IGE) component of NRT, which focuses on test -bed projects aimed at piloting, testing, and validating innovative and potentially transform ative approaches to graduate education, including activities such as career preparation, mentoring, partnerships, and internships. NSF expects to fund about 17- 20 traineeships and up to $8.0 million in fundamental research in graduate education. DC: The National Academies Press.

The LSAMP program provides funding to alliances comprised of multiple degree- granting organizations that can implement comprehensive and sustained strategies that result in the gradu ation of well -prepared, highly qualified students from underrepresented groups. The LSAMP -BD is a targeted activity where established alliances provide post-baccalaureate fellowships for students to successfully transition from master's degrees and/or ear n STEM doctoral degrees and be competitive in the STEM workforce. In FY 2021 LSAMP will focus largely on undergraduate students and the competition for the LSAMP BD activity will be on hold to review the different tracks of LSAMP and anticipate having a revised solicitation by FY 2021. NSF Scholarships in Science, Technology, Engineering, and Mathematics (S- STEM) NSF established the S -STEM program in accordance with the American Competitiveness and Workforce Improvement Act of 1998 (P.L. 105- 277), as modif ied by P.L. 106- 313 and P.L. 108- 447 in 2005. The Act reflects the national need to increase substantially the number of American scientists and engineers. The S-STEM program provides institutions with funds for student scholarships to encourage and enabl e low - income, academically talented U.S. students with demonstrable financial need to enter the STEM workforce or STEM graduate school following completion of an associate, baccalaureate, or graduate degree in STEM fields. The program emphasizes the importance of recruiting students to STEM disciplines, mentoring and supporting students through degree completion, and partnering with employers to facilitate student career placement in the STEM workforce. S -STEM provides individual scholarships of up to $10,000 per year, depending on cost of attendance and unmet financial need. S -STEM expects to fund about 300 Masters or PhD students in FY 2021. In addition to the long- standing scholarship support, S -STEM projects contribute to the knowledge base of research in education by carrying out research on factors such as recruitment and retention of STEM students. S -STEM is funded through H -1B Nonimmigrant Petitioner Account receipts. Robert Noyce Teacher Scholarship (Noyce) The Noyce program supports talen ted STEM professionals to become K -12 STEM teachers. It also supports experienced, exemplary K -12 STEM teachers to become leaders and innovators in STEM education at their school or district.

Centers exploit opportunities in science, engineering, and technology in which the complexity of the research program or the resources needed to solve the problem require the advantages of scope, scale, duration, equipment, facilities, and students. Centers are a principal means by which NSF fosters interdisciplinary research. NSF is also funding AI uantum center -like institutes in FY 2021 . See the NSF- Wide Investments chapter for more information on these two efforts.

Preparation for a new competition is underway. Centers for Chemical Innovation (MPS) The FY 2021 Request of $ 21.0 million is expected to fund up to six Phase II Centers for Chemical Innovation ( CCI). This includes up to five continuing centers and one new center. The CCI program makes awards at two levels: smaller Phase I awards (three -year) for center development, and larger Phase II awards (five -year awards with potential for renewal up to a total of ten years) for full centers. In FY 2021, up to five continuing Phase II CCIs will be funded. In addition, two FY 2018 Phase I CCIs will be eligible to compete for Phase II in FY 202 1; up to one new Phase II CCI is anticipated . A Phase I CCI competition will be held in FY 2021, supporting up to three new developmental awards. The themes of the new Phase I and II CCI s are varied and include Artificial Intelligence (AI); the Big Ideas: QL, URoL, and HDR ; and sustainable chemistry, synthetic biology, clean energy technologies, and other topics in Advanced Manufacturing. The CCI Program supports research centers focused on major, long- term fundamental chemical research challenges. CCIs a ddress these challenges by produc ing transformative research lead ing to innovation and attract ing broad scientific and public interest that lead to better lives for all Americans . For example, the Center for Sustainable Polymers initiated an exploratory project that uses complex molecules formed from sugars to remove trace impurities and emerging contaminants from water , which affect s drinki ng water systems used by about 15 million people in 27 states in the United States . CCIs are agile, collaborative entities that respond rapidly to emerging opportunities by integrating research with innovation, higher education, broadening participation, and informal science communication. A broad range of chemical research is currently represented at CCIs advancing fundamental understanding in: NSF Centers NSF-Wide Investments - 48 chemical synthesis and catalysis; characterization, theory, computation, and modeling; data science, machine learning, and AI for molecular synthesis; and advanced manufacturing of nanomaterials; along with training for students at all levels. CCIs are also actively engaged in knowledge transfer to industry and the commercialization of their discoveries and new technologies. Each year, CCIs include nearly 100 participating academic institutions, 74 non-academic partner institutions, and over 175 Senior Personnel, 100 Postdoctoral Associates, 255 Graduate Students, and 6 0 Undergraduate Stude nts. Engineeri ng Research Centers (ENG) The FY 2021 Request is $50.92 million. This funding level support s 13 NSF Engineering Research Centers (ERC) . The total includes funding for three 4th -generation ERCs , funded as part of the Class of 2020 that will a dvance convergent engineering research to tackle high- impact challenges that have the potential to benefit U.S. security, prosperity, health, and society. The new ERCs will implement new strategies for effective team formation and engagement with stakeholder communities to maximize their impacts. Four centers from the Class of 2010 received final year NSF funding in FY 2020 as planned. All NSF ERCs enable innovation, combining the energy and intellectual curiosity of university research focused on discover y with real -world engineered systems and technology opportunities through partnerships with industry. Since the program began in 1985, products of ERC innovation include more than 2,44 0 inventions disclosures, approximately 2,100 patent applications filed, 850 patents awarded, and 1,360 licenses. ERCs also have a successful track record for educating a technology -enabled workforce with hands -on, real -world experience. Together, NSF ERC's have graduated annually, on average, 134 Bachelor's, 128 Master's, and 150 Doctoral degree students for the past 33 years. Over that time, they have also impacted, on average, over 2,120 K -12 teachers and students annually. NSF ERCs are also effective at broadening participation from underrepresented groups. For example, acr oss currently active ERCs, women comprise approximately 35 percent of those involved in center activities, in comparison to the national average of 24 percent across engineering. Also, t he percentage of people from underrepresented groups participating is more than double that of engineering's national average. The ERC program periodically commissions studies by external evaluators to examine aspects of the program, such as the effectiveness of ERC graduates in industry and the benefits of ERC membership to industry. In FY 2015, NSF funded the National Academies of Sciences, Engineering, and Medicine to study the future of center -based, multidisciplinary engineering research. The study report, delivered May 2, 2017, articulates a vision fo r the future of NSF -supported center -scale, multidisciplinary engineering research. 1 After careful consideration, in FY 2018 ENG sparked new convergent engineering research collaborations through planning grants, providing 60 awards to build capacity for a new generation of ERCs. In October 2018, ENG released a solicitation (NSF 19 -503)2 for the 4th -generation of ERCs and anticipates awards in FY 2020. The program also commissioned a study on the sustainability of ERCs once NSF funding has ended. The 2010 report 3 \"Post -Graduation Status of National Science Foundation Engineering Research Centers\" (SciTech Communications), augmented by a 2015 update, found that 29 of the 35 centers (83 percent) that graduated after 10 years of NSF support are self -sustain ing, with most NSF ERC features in place and strong financial support from other government sources and industry partners. NSF plans to commission a new study in FY 2020 that is expected to be completed in late 2021. Request to Congress NSF- Wide Investments - 49 Materials Centers ( MPS) The FY 2021 Request of $52.51 million is expected to support 17 to 18 continuing Materials Research Science and Engineering Centers (MRSEC). A MRSEC competition is not planned for FY 2021 as this long- standing, flagship program will complete its triennial competition in FY 2020, funding up to nine new centers. MRSECs function as hubs to solve complex grand challenge materials problems requiring broad multidisciplinary expertise within the physical sciences and engineering to understand materials phenomena, exploit ma terials behavior, and to create and discover new materials. Research in materials science is inherently interdisciplinary and the MRSEC program is a prime example of convergent research encompassing physics, chemistry, mathematics, biology, and engineering. Through collaborative efforts involving academics, industry, national laboratories experts, and international and educational partners, MRSECs advance materials research and education in the U.S., and in many cases are international leaders. MRSECs have five major components: (1) interdisciplinary research thrusts, (2) education and outreach, (3) industrial outreach/partnerships, (4) the materials research facilities network \u2014providing access to more than 1,250 state -of-the art equipment instru mentation to materials researchers across the Nation \u2014and (5) the SEED program, which enables MRSECs to rapidly react/move into new high risk and potentially transformative areas not yet fully explored. FY 2019 seeding efforts were built within each MRSEC to start addressing emerging research areas relevant to the Division of Materials Research. These areas include NSF's Big Ideas QL, FW -HTF, URoL, and HDR, as well as r ecyclable plastics and alternative materials for sustainable development, synthetic materials biology, structural materials under extreme conditions, and the use of machine l earning to accelerate materials discovery . Each year, MRSECs produce over 200 Ph.Ds . in STEM fields, mentor nearly 500 R esearch Experiences for Undergraduate students and 70 Research Experiences for T eachers participants , and impact over 1 million students and parents through outreach activities such as summer camps, K -12 science curriculum development, K -12 in- school science demonstrations, development and deployment of science kits, and partnering with the Nation's top museums to create STEM- related exhibits that impact the public. Since 1994, the program has created over 172 startups and annually produces about 50 awarded patents and 30 patent li censures. MRSECs engage and assist about 250 industrial partners per year in advancing fundamental materials research that can be translated into the marketplace. Science and Technology Centers: Integrative Partnerships (multi-directorat e) The FY 2021 Request of $57.95 million will support a total of 12 Science and Technology Centers (STC) and the administrative costs associated with program management and oversight. Of the twelve centers, seven are continuing STCs from the FY 2013 and FY 2016 cohorts, and five will be new centers starting in FY 2021. In FY 2019, a solicitation for a new STC class was issued to replace the sunsetting 2010 cohort. The program received 188 preliminary proposals with the expectation of making five new awards in FY 2021 for a t otal of $25.0 million. Currently, full STC awards are for five years, with possible renewal for an additional five years, or 10 years total. The award sizes of the existing STCs are approximately $5.0 million per year with ramp down in years nine and ten. The STC program advances interdisciplinary discovery and innovation in science and engineering through the integration of cutting- edge research, excellence in education, targeted knowledge transfer, and the development of a diverse workforce. The STC port folio reflects NSF -supported disciplines; examples include: creation of atomic -scale devices and systems based on quantum materials; elucidating the mechanisms and architecture of intelligence in the human brain; studying mechanical forces in molecules, cells, and tissues of plants and animals; and developing atomic scale imaging. STCs engage the Nation's intellectual talent and collaborate with partners in academia, industry, national laboratories, and government. STCs strengthen the caliber of the Nation' s science, technology, engineering, and mathematics NSF Centers NSF-Wide Investments - 50 workforce through intellectually challenging research experiences for students, postdoctoral fellows, researchers, and educators; they advance public scientific understanding through partnerships with K -12 and informal education communities. The knowledge transfer activities focus on engaging stakeholders with the intent of supporting innovation, providing information to policy -makers, and disseminating knowledge across scientific disciplines. For example, the Sustainability of semi -Arid Hydrology and Riparian Areas (SAHRA) STC disseminated knowledge to the community of water professionals and elected officials to help them make more scientifically informed decisions on water policy and management . The STC program also uses a network of evaluators working with the centers to share information and lessons learned about the most effective way to measure progress.

The FY 2021 Request provides $254.22 million for the CAREER program , funding approximately 200 new CAREER awards, which support exceptionally promising college and university junior faculty who are committed to the integration of research and education and who are most likely to become the leaders in their fields. BIO, CISE, ENG, GEO, MPS, and SBE provi de funding for CAREER . Long -Term Ecological Research (LTER) The FY 2021 Request provides $27.96 million for LTER , which supports fundamental research that requires data collection over long time periods to unravel the principles and processes of ecological science, which frequently involves long- lived species, lega cy influences, and rare events. This program supports a loosely coordinated network of 29 field sites that focus on: (1) understanding ecological phenomena that occur over long temporal and broad spatial scales; (2) creating a legacy of well -designed, long- term ecological experiments; (3) conducting major syntheses and theoretical efforts; and (4) providing information to identify and to address environmental challenges. LTER projects represent a diversity of habitats in continental North America, the Caribbean, Pacific Ocean, Arctic, and the Antarctic; including coral reefs, arid grasslands, es tuaries, lakes, prairies, forests, alpine and Arctic tundra, urban areas, and agroecosystems. The support for LTER in FY 2021 will be used to sustain site- specific research activities examining ecological and evolutionary dynamics in natural populations, c ommunities, and ecosystems, some of which have been studied for over 30 years, and conducting syntheses of long- term data using contemporary modeling methods. BIO and GEO provide f unding for LTER. The National Ecological Observatory Network (NEON) infrast ructure is co-located at eight LTER sites. NEON is a continental -scale infrastructure facility providing standardized physical and data resources to researchers and educators. LTER is a network of long -term research projects aimed at understanding ecologic al processes in a wide range of ecosystems. Ongoing research at LTER sites may take advantage of data generated using NEON infrastructure.

NSF's global change -related programs support the research and related activities to advance fundamental understanding of physical, chemical, biological, and human systems and the interacti ons among them. P rograms encourage interdisciplinary approaches to studying Earth system processes and the consequences of change, including how humans respond to changing environments and the impacts on ecosystems and the essential services they provide. NSF has been investing in the fundamental research at the heart of global change issues for several decades. Long- term, continuous, and consistent observational records are essential for testing hypotheses quantitatively and are thus a cornerstone of global change research. NSF supports a variety of research observing networks that complement, and are dependent on, the climate monitoring systems maintained by its federal partners. The results of NSF investments have helped communities address challenges associated with mitigation , adaptation, and other responses to a changing and variable environment. NSF funding for USGCRP in the FY 202 1 Request is $ 217.09 million. NSF's investments will continue to support research that contributes to the USGCRP Goal Areas to (1) advance scientific knowledge of the integrated natural and human components of the Earth sys tem and (2) i nform decisions by providing the scientific b asis to inform and enable timely decisions on adaptation and mitigation. In FY 2021, NSF will continue to engage with other USGCRP agencies on priorities from intra -seasonal to centennial predictability, predictions, and projections; water cycle research; understanding the impacts of global change on the Arctic region and effects on global climate; and fundamental research on actionable science. In addition, NSF will further seek greater integration of social -science research, methodologies, and insights into understanding and supporting responses to global change, improving computing capacity, and maintaining needed observational capabilities over time. Past investments have helped inform the National Climate Assessment and several other technical reports mandated by the Global Climate Research Act of 1990. Investments have also aided U .S. communities to develop mitigation and adaptation strategies to address both challenges and opportunities derived from a changing environment. The fundam ental knowledge gained through NSF disciplinary and cross -cutting programs focusing on the coupled natural -human system are critical in developing effective solutions to these challenges and opportunities. FY 20 21 Budget Request to Congress NSF-Wide Investments - 65 FY 2021 Investments by Program Component Area ( PCA) Goal 1: Advance scientific knowledge of the integrated natural and human components of the Earth system Earth System Understanding: NSF participates in the Earth System Understanding PCA to improve our knowledge of the Earth's past and present clima te variability and change through activities to document and understand long- term climate cycles across the globe, as well as to better understand the natural variability of climate and the processes responsible for global changes using a range of paleocli mate and instrumental data and modeling approaches. NSF also supports activities to improve our understanding of the frequency and intensity of extreme climate events, particularly wet and dry extremes of the water cycle, their causes, and how those may be manifested in the future. Upgrading and expanding critical environmental observing systems are vital to these efforts. NSF also supports Earth System Understanding through activities spanning a broad range of disciplines and topics that seek to better understand the physical, geological, chemical, biological, and human components of the Earth system and their interactions. Examples of major foci include fundamental research on all aspects of the carbon cycle, the water cycle, atmospheric composit ion and greenhouse gas processes, marine and terrestrial ecosystems, and ocean and atmospheric circulations that both drive and respond to climate and global change. Human drivers of change include urbanization, population growth, and economic and technological development over a range of temporal scales and NSF has a strong commitment to fostering new interdisciplinary research approaches that allow exploration of the interdependencies across these areas. Integrated Observations : NSF contributes to the In tegrated Observations PCA through its advanced capabilities to observe the physical, chemical, biological, and human components of the Earth system over multiple space and time scales. Facilities such as the Academic Research Fleet and the National Ecologi cal Observatory Network assist the Nation in gaining a fundamental scientific understanding of the Earth as well as monitor important variations and trends that allow the research community to examine major feedback processes between the climate and natura l and human systems. Integrated Modeling : NSF will continue to devote significant resources to advancing climate modeling capabilities from global and centennial to regional and decadal scales. Since there is increasingly deep interplay among observations and modeling at multiple spatial and temporal scales, a high priority will be given to developing more complete representations \u2014models of coupled interactive atmospheric chemistry, terrestrial and marine ecosystems, biogeochemical cycling, and middle atm ospheric processes. In addition, NSF is encouraging the development of ecosystem and water models at regional scales, as well as models that integrate human system components such as risk, vulnerability, and decision -making. Goal 2. Inform Decisions: Provide the scientific basis to inform and enable timely decisions on adaptation and mitigation Inform Adaptation and Mitigation : A key focus of the USGCRP is developing better means of assessing and responding to the impacts of global change as well as the v ulnerability and resilience of both human and natural systems to those changes, particularly in highly sensitive regions such as the Arctic. In addition to supporting research that will inform adaptation decisions, NSF will also support fundamental research regarding the science of adaptation, defined as the adjustment in natural or human systems to a new or changing environment that exploits beneficial opportunities or moderates negative effects. This research ranges from developing the theoretical framework for evaluating adaptation options (and avoiding unintended consequences of adaptation choices) to risk assessment and decision -making. NSF will continue interdisciplinary research (including human factors) in water sustainability, resiliency, biodiversi ty, ocean acidification, and vulnerable areas, particularly in the rapidly changing Arctic.

Information about NSF's performance can also be found on the NSF website in the FY 2019 Performance and Financial Highlights Report. 1 Strategic Plan and Strategic Objectives In FY 2018, NSF released its Strategic Plan for FYs 2018- 2022: Building the Future: Investing in Discovery and Innovation. 1 This Plan lays out two strategic goals that embody the dual nature of NSF's mission to advance the progress of science while benefitting the Nation : Expand knowledge in science, engineering, and learning and Advance the capability of the Nation to meet current and future challenges . A third goal, Enhance NSF's performance of its mission, directs NSF to hold itself accountable for achieving exc ellence in carrying out its mission. Each goal has two Strategic Objectives which together encompass all areas of agency activity. This goal structure enables NSF to link its investments to longer -term outcomes. Strategic Goal Strategic Objective 1 Expand knowledge in science, engineering, and learning. 1.1 Knowledge Advance knowledge through investments in ideas, people, and infrastructure. 1.2 Practice Advance the practice of research. 2 Advance the capability of the Nation to meet current and future challenges. 2.1 Societal Impacts Support research and promote partnerships to accelerate innovation and to provide new capabilities to meet pressing societal needs. 2.2 STEM Workforce Foster the growth of a more capable and diverse research workforce and advance the scientific and innovation skills of the Nation. 3 Enhance NSF's performance of its mission. 3.1 Human Capital Attract, retain, and empower a talented and diverse workforce. 3.2 Processes and Operations Continually improve agency operations. Agency Priority Goal and Performance Plan The most prominent goal in NSF's FY 202 1 APP is its Agency Priority Goal in the area of Partnerships. This is a continuation of the previous APG in this area, which expanded the number of public and private partnerships NSF entered into between FY 2017 and FY 2019. The current iteration of the Partnerships APG covers the time period of FY 2020- FY 2021 and is broader in scope, seeking to strengthen NSF's capacity to strategically engage in partnerships. The APP also includes two goals aimed at maintaining and improving customer service: NSF's longstanding performance goal to make timely award decisions and a goal, which was new in FY 2018, that focuses on improving the quality of the reviews written by outside reviewers. The APP also continues two goals aimed at monitoring of key program and infr astructure investments. Monitoring of activities funded as Mid- scale Research Infrastructure supported by the MREFC account was added to the infrastructure investment monitoring goal in FY 2020. 1 www.nsf.gov/about/performance Performance and Management Performance and Management - 4 Renewing NSF For the third year, NSF's APP supports the Renewing NSF effort, the agency -wide change initiative that arose from NSF's internal work over the summer of 2017 to implement agency reform per M -17-22. NSF wrote Renewing NSF into its annual performance plans beginning in F Y 2019: the former and current APG in support of Partnerships supports one of the four pillars of Renewing NSF, and the existing goals in the Performance Plan that monitor inclusion, human resources, and information technology customer service were refocused to support Renewing NSF efforts in Workforce and IT. FY 2021 Budget Request to Congress Performance and Management - 5 FY 2019 NSF STRATEGIC OBJECTIVE PROGRESS UPDATE S In FY 2019, the National Science Foundation conducted Strategic Reviews (SRs) of the six Strategic Objectives in its 2018- 2022 Strategic Plan in response to the requirement of the GPRA Modernization Act 2010 Section 1116(f). Table 1 summarizes the analyses performed and the outcomes to date of each SR. The table also provides NSF's determination as to whether performance towards an Objective is making noteworthy progress, should pursue f ocused improvement, or neither. FY 2019 Process and Modifications In FY 2019, NSF streamlined its SR process to ensure completion in a timeframe that could inform FY 2021 budget development. In an approach informed by Enterprise Risk Management (ERM) pri nciples, topics were chosen to support and inform two areas where process improvements were immediately needed: development of the new OMB dashboard to highlight agency performance, and application of lessons learned during the lapse to our operations and towards maturation of the NSF model for major facilities oversight. NSF did not conduct a review in an area relevant to each of its Objectives, although each Review applied to more than one Objective. For the FY 2018 Objective rankings, NSF's Performance Improvement Officer (PIO) assessed the maturation stage of each SR's implementation plans. No evidence was found that would warrant changes to those rankings in FY 2019.

Performance and Management Performance and Management - 6 Strategic Review of Merit Review Report Modernization Strategic Objective 1.1 : Knowledge: Advance knowledge through investments in ideas, people, and infrastructure. Strategic Objective 1.2 : Practice: Advance the practice of research. Strategic Objective 3.2 : Processes and Operations: Continually improve agency operations. The strategic review explored evidence to inform agency planning and decision making and a strategy to improve the Merit Review Report (MRR) .1 To ensure the integrity, quality, accountability, and transparency of its policies and processes, NSF prepares and submits an annual MRR to the National Science Board. It contains a statistical summary of the operation of the meri t review process, including information on the number of proposals submitted, funding rates, average award sizes and durations, and information about the diversity of proposers, awardees and reviewers. In July 2018, the NSB Committee on Oversight asked NSF to examine how the Merit Review Report could be made more useful with a goal of providing greater accountability, openness , and transparency about the merit review process and enabling continuous assessment and improvement of the merit review process. Three Key Analytical Questions were posed: 1. How can we broaden understanding of the merit review process's correspondence to NSF's mission and increase the value of information about it to stakeholders? 2. How can NSF inform and empower key stakeholders by revising electronic access to Merit Review Report content? 3. How can NSF leverage existing resources to sustainably maintain an improved online version of Merit Review Report content ? The SR team consulted a broad range of internal stakehold ers, examined a similar effort undertaken by the NSF National Center for Science and Engineering Statistics (NCSES), and reviewed data from existing merit review surveys of PIs and reviewers. The team found that many NSF Program Officers are unfamiliar with the Merit Review Report and its value as a resource when communicating with their PI communities. Some program officers reported using the report to disabuse communities of misconceptions about the review process. For example, a major misconception evident in recent PI surveys is that a majority of PIs believed that the proposal funding rate was 10 percent or lower, when it has historically been about 22 percent Foundation- wide. The strategic review team concluded that a scoping feasibility study is nec essary to better inform the Merit Review Report modernization effort, and that a coherent communications strategy would improve understanding and the usefulness of the Merit Review Report contents. Activities after the SR In response to the Strategic Review findings and recommendations, NSF is engaging in a feasibility study to inform plans for subsequent steps of the modernization activities. In consultation with key stakeholders, especially the National Science Board Committee on Oversight, NSF will develop a prioritized approach to creating a Merit Review dashboard that provides access to detailed information about NSF's merit review process. In concert with the development of the dashboard, NSF will implement a coordinated communications p lan aimed at informing internal and external stakeholders about the Merit Review report and related electronic resources. 1 Copies from 1996 forward are available online at www.nsf.gov/nsb/publications/pubmeritreview.jsp. FY 2021 Budget Request to Congress Performance and Management - 7 Strategic Review of Funding Continuity for NSF's Major Facilities Portfolio Strategic Objective 1.1 : Knowledge: Advance knowledge through investments in ideas, people, and infrastructure. Strategic Objective 3.2 : Processes and Operations: Continually improve agency operations. This Strategic Review focused on the evaluation of agency practices in fundin g NSF's Major Facilities. Specif ically, it incorporated lessons learned from the maturation of the recently -created Chief Officer for Research Facilities (CORF) position and from the impact of the FY 2019 lapse in appropriations on the major facilities portfolio. NSF's portfolio of major facilities represents a substantial fraction of its total budget, including construction and operations of facilities at sites throughout the U.S. and around the world. Oversight of activities related to these facilities is led by p rogram officers (PO) in distinct directorates, in close collaboration with multiple divisions within the Office of Budget, Finance, and Award Management (BFA). NSF has traditionally managed major facilities as discrete programs in their relevant directorates, and the divisions within those directorates, with summary data collected and presented only once a year as part of the Congressional Budget Request. Day-to-day oversight is generally provided at the division level by POs, in coordination with other members of an NSF Integrated Project Team. T he distributed nature of this approach requires extensive coordination of oversight activities across the agency . Two emerging elements in NSF's Major Facilities management inspired this review: 1. As mandated by Congress in the 2017 American Innovation and Competitiveness Act (AICA), the CORF, in the Office of the Director, is responsible for overall full life- cycle oversight of NSF's Major Facilities. 2. The lapse in appropriations from December 22, 2018 to January 25, 2019 highlighted several of the challenges involved in facilities oversight and financial management: how NSF ensures that appropriate facility funding obligations are in place throughout the fiscal year, how NSF management is able to quickly and accurately monitor the financial status of each facility to ensure that adequate funding is available, and how the funding is distributed to the facilities on a routine basis. Following the resumption of NSF operations in January 2019, this Strategic Review analyzed lessons learned and considered potential improvements in facilities funding and oversight practices that would be applicable throughout the fiscal year to ensure funding continuity across all of NSF's M ajor Facilities. The team concluded that targeted improvements in NSF's financial management of its major facilities portfolio would enhance the stability of operations and decrease risks to NSF's missi on. Specifically, a centralized and reliable method to provide timely and accurate financial information for all of the m ajor facilities is needed in order to better inform agency- level decision making on a continual basis. In addition, NSF needs agency -wide guidelines for how funds should be routinely obligated to major facilities operations and maintenance (O&M) awards in order to support on- going science activities and to improve financial stability for the recipients at key operational milestones throughout the year. These guidelines must consider workload impacts and be flexible enough to address the diversity of facilities and funding circumstances across NSF divisions. Activities after the SR In response to the Strategic Review findings and recommendations, NSF issued a cross- directorate instruction memo on August 6 th regarding the requirements for facility funding at potential discontinuity points in federal funding (e.g., end of Fiscal Year, end date of short -term Continuing Resolutions). A major facilities funding health \"dashboard\" for internal use is under development. FY 2019 A nnual P erformance R eport and FY 2021 A nnual P erformance P lan Performance and Management - 8 FY 2019 ANNUAL PERFORMANCE REPORT AND FY 2021 ANNUAL PERFORMANCE PLAN This document combines NSF's FY 2019 Annual Per formance Report and FY 2021 Annual Performance Plan (APP + APR = APPR) . FY 2020's goals , and historical information on individual goals , are also provided when available. Results for each performance goal are presented in strategic context, with reference to strategic goals, objectives, and targets from NSF's 2018 -2022 Strategic Plan. Multiple years of trend data are avail able for NSF's longstanding quantitative performance measures (Infrastructure Investments and Timely Proposal Decisions). Other performance goals monitor progress towards multiyear goals, such as implementation of a new process (Improve Review Quality, Cul ture of Inclusion), upgrades to ongoing processes (Align Job Requirements, Improve User Interactions), or strategically important investments (Key Program Investments, Expand Public and Private Partnerships). In FY 2019, NSF tracked progress toward its three strategic goals using eight performance goals, one of which was an Agency Priority Goal . Six of the eight goals partially or fully achieve d their targets in FY 2019 and two goals missed their targets . FY 2021 Budget Request to Congress Performance and Management - 9 Goal 1, Agency Priority Goal (APG) : Public and Private Partnerships Lead Organizations: Directorate for Biological Sciences, Directorate for Computer and Information Science and Engineering. Goal Statement Strategically engage in public and private partnerships to enhance the impact of NSF 's investments and contribute to American economic competitiveness and security. Measure, Milestone, or Deliverable Strategic Alignment Strategic Goal 2: Advance the capability of the Nation to meet current and future challenges. Objective 2.1, Societal Impacts: Support research and promote partnerships to accelerate innovation and to provide new capabilities to meet pressing societal needs. About This Goal This goal incorporates principles from Renewing NSF, the agency operational reform plan initiated in FY 2017 in response to M -17-22, \" Comprehensive Plan for Reforming the Federal Government .\" Private industry, foundations, and non- profits, together with other federal agencies and international funding organizations, bring additional expertise, resources, and capacity to NSF -funded research. This, in turn, accelerates discovery and translation of research to products and services, and enhances preparation of the future workforce to benefit society and grow the American economy. Partnerships require significant time and intellectual capital, as well as strategic foresight, in their development. NSF will improve efficiencies in developing, implementing, and managing partnerships to ultimately grow the number and scope of partnerships and maximize the scientific, economic, and societal impacts of its investments. Current Year FY Target Summary 2020 - 2021 To benefit the U.S. scientific and engineering research and education enterprise, by September 30, 2021, NSF will develop and pursue an age ncy-wide partnerships strategy, components of which will include targeted outreach, implementation of process improvements, and improvement of internal and external communications. Reporting Year FY Target Summary Result 2019 Expand public and private partnerships to enhance the impact of NSF's investments and contribute to American economic competitiveness and security. By September 30, 2019, NSF's number of partnerships and award actions with other federal agencies, private industry, and foundations/philanthropies will grow by five percent, relative to the FY 2017 baseline, to make available infrastructure, expertise, and financial resources to the US scientific and engineering research and edu cation enterprise. Achieved . FY 2017 baseline = 57 partnerships 70 partnerships in FY 2019, an increase of 2 3 percent over FY 2017 baseline.

Additionally, the P artnerships APG i mplementation team increased the Foundation's awareness of partnerships , increased the attention paid to strategy and diversity of opportunity in partnership formation, and streamlined processes relating to partnerships. See performance.gov/NSF for a fuller report on these ac tivities. FY 2020 and Planned FY 2021 Changes In FY 2020 and beyond, the Partnerships pillar of Renewing NSF and the APG Implementation Team will merge to strengthen NSF's partnerships strategy. The group will focus on the strategic value of the Foundation's partnerships, including a milestone -oriented approach to reporting and assessing progress. The group plans to continue refining the approach used in FY s 2018- 2019 to quantitatively track partnerships . FY 2021 Budget Request to Congress Performance and Management - 11 Goal 2, Ensure that Key Program Investments are on Track Lead Organization: Office of Budget, Finance, and Award Management. Goal Statement Ensure that key NSF -wide program investments are implemented and on track. Measure, Milestone, or Deliverable Strategic Alignment Strategic Goal 1: Expand knowledge in science, engineering, and learning (all Objectives ) Strategic Goal 2: Advance the capability of the Nation to meet current and future challenges ( all Objectives ) About This Goal NSF instituted the Key Program Investments goal in FY 2014 to track the interim progress of major investments towards their long- term goals. Each year, NSF highlights a number of cross -agency investments in its Budget Request to Congress. Most are described in the NSF -Wide Investments chapter of the Budget Request. Although the overall impact of these investments might not be measurable for many years, tracking near -term indicators of progress can help the agency make formative changes or course corrections . NSF selects a subset of these investments for closer quarterly tracking by agency leadership, based on internal assessments of the value that tracking is likely to add. For example, new programs, programs with recent changes, or high- profile programs m ay benefit from the attention of leadership, and programs that are stably operating or sunsetting have reduced need for monitoring. Discussion of FY 2019 Results NSF monitored ten Big Ideas investments under this goal in FY 2019. This was the first fisca l year when all Big Ideas issued solicitations. NSF monitored solicitation issuance dates, numbers of proposals received and awards made, and funding oblig ated. Reports were reviewed with senior leaders at three points (due to the lapse in funding in Q1 and Q2 at both NSF and OMB, Q1 and Q2 performance reporting requirements were considered together after the lapse ended). FY 2020 and Planned FY 2021 Changes The Big Ideas will remain the f ocus of this goal . The unit of measurement is being modified to simplify quarterly tracking and the determination of achievement . Goal Change History The intended purpose of tracking these key investments is to ensure that these projects meet internal milestones and issue funding adequate to achieve the desired advances in science and engineering. NSF's independent verification and validation team has pointed out weaknesses in the measurability, and therefore utility, of this goal. The measurement method was established in FY 2014 to accommodate prog rams with Current and Upcoming Years FY Target Summary 2021 NSF will obligate 100 percent of designated funding targets for all identified NSF -wide priority investments. 2020 Reporting Year FY Target Summary Result 2019 1.

Since the Big Ideas are defined and tracked similarly, NSF is changing from a qualitative approach (where the unit of analysis is a pr ogram) to a quantitative approach (unit of analysis is the percentage of funds obligated relative to a target). This change will make for a more quantifiable and meaningful goal. By design, this goal's monitored programs change annually to match the funding priorities of the year. In addition to the annual change in the list of monitored programs, described in the narrative and the table below, the Goal Statements have changed slightly each year for this goal, as follows: FY 2019: Ensure th at key FY 2019 NSF -wide program investments are implemented and on track.

Measure, Milestone, or Deliverable Strategic Alignment Strategic Goal 1: Expand knowledge in science, engineering, and learning. Objective 1.1, Knowledge: Advance knowledge through investments in ideas, people, and infrastructure. About This Goal The MREFC account supports the acquisition, construction, and c ommissioning of major research facilities and equipment that provide unique capabilities at the frontiers of science and engineering. Performance of construction projects funded by the MREFC account is monitored using the Earned Value Management System (EVM S). EVM S is an integrated management control system for assessing, understanding, and quantifying what a contractor or field activity is achieving with program dollars. Monitoring cost and schedule is a standard measure of performance for construction projects. Projects that are under 10 percent complete are not considered eligible for this goal because EVM data is less meaningful statistically in the very early stages of a project. Discussion of FY 2019 Results For more information about all projects currently funded from the MREFC account, see the Major Research Current and U pcoming Years FY Target 2021 Construction Project Monitoring (MREFC and R&RA): 1.

All of the projects that were over 10 percen t complete by the end of FY 2019 were on track. At the end of FY 2019, the Da niel K. Inouye Solar Telescope was 94 percent complete, the Large Synoptic Survey Telescope was 75 percent complete, and the Regional Class Research Vessel project was 21 percent complete . Each project had cost and schedule variances well below the 10 perc ent thresholds. The National Ecological Observatory Network completed the construction phase in FY 2019. FY 20 20 and Planned FY 202 1 Changes In FY 2020, the population of projects will expand. The Antarctic Infrastructure Modernization for Science project is likely to cross the 10 percent complete threshold during FY 2020. Additionally, projects funded by the NSF Mid -scale Research Infrastructure Big Idea (MSRI) will also be tracked by t his goal. More specifically, those MSRI projects with a Total Project Cost above $20.0 million will be tracked using EVM principles . FY 2021 Budget Request to Congress Performance and Management - 15 Goal 4, Make Timely Proposal Decisions Lead Organization: Office of Integrative Activities. Goal Statement Inform applicants whether their proposals have been declined or recommended for funding within 182 days, or six months, of deadline, target, or receipt date, whichever is later. Measure, Milestone, or Deliverable Strategic Alignment Strategic Goal 3, Enhance NSF's performance of its mission. Objective 3.2, Processes and Operations: Continually improve agency operations. About This Goal Time to decision or \"dwell time\" is the amount of time that passes between receipt of a proposal and notification to the principal investigator (PI) about the funding decision. At the time of this goal's establishment in the early 2000s, one of the most significant issues raised in customer satisfaction surveys was the time it took NSF to process proposals, with only around 50 percen t of proposals receiving responses within 6 months of submission or deadline . Too long a time period inhibits the progress of research as it delays the funding process, but too short a time period may inhibit review quality. The 75 percent target seeks to strike a balance between the need of the PI for timely action and the need of NSF for a credible and efficient merit review system. Since this goal was introduced, NSF's response times have improved, and over 70 percent of proposals have received responses in under 6 months for nearly two decades . More recent surveys have shown that this is now the second most common concern mentioned by PIs (see Goal 6, Improve Review Quality, for more recent survey results). Discussion of FY 2019 Result Explanation of U nmet Goal NSF missed this goal in FY 2019 due to the 35- day lapse in funding during December 2018- January 2019. More specifically , this goal was missed due to key decisions that were made when prioritizing work upon Current and Upcoming Years FY Target 2021 75 percent. 2020 Reporting Year FY Target Result 2019 75 percent. Not Achieved. Measure Information for All Years (see \"Goal Change History\" for details) FY including targets for FY 2020- 2021 A nnual P erformance P lan Performance and Management - 16 returning to normal operations . As in FY 2017, when NSF was relocating to its new headquarters in Alexandria, upon resumption of operations in Q2 FY 2019 NSF staff were directed to prioritize processing award decisions ahead of decline decisions. In FY 2017 this shift in work facilitated an early close -out, while in FY 2019 this shift made up for the lost weeks of award processing work in the middle of the fiscal year. This decision to prioritize awards is likely to affect the FY 2020 dwell time result, as NSF is now processing a backlog of likely declines . FY 2020 and Planned FY 2021 Changes NSF will continue its target of informing 75 percent of proposers of the decisions reached within 6 months of submission. Goal Change History In FY 2015, the target was raised from 70 to 75 percent to be more in line with the historical trend of achievem ent from 75 to 80 percent. The low dwell time result in FY 2014, 72 percent, was likely due to Foundation- wide delays in proposal processing after the lapse in funding authority i n October 2013. FY 2021 Budget Request to Congress Performance and Management - 17 Goal 5, Improve Review Quality Lead Organization: Office of Integrative Activities, Office of the Director. Goal Statement Improve the quality of written reviews of NSF proposals. Measure, Milestone, or Deliverable Strategic Alignment Strategic Goal 1: Expand knowledge in science, engineering, and learning (all Objectives ) Strategic Goal 3 : Enhance NSF's performance of its mission. Objective 3.2, Processes and Operations: Continually improve agency operations. About This Goal This goal addresses and incorporates feedback NSF has received about its customer service. Committees of Visitors, program officers, and principal investigators (PIs) frequently note that the quality of individual written reviews is variable. In 2015, NSF conducted a survey of researchers who were submitting and/or reviewing pr oposals. Survey respondents identified the quality of reviews as the factor that would have the most significant effect on improving their proposals and fostering science (see chart below, n=22,174 respondents). A strategic review in the spring of 2015 rec ommended that NSF apply what was learned from the PI and reviewer survey to inform a new performance goal aimed at improving customer service. This goal was designed in r esponse to that recommendation. This goal measures the implementation of a pilot program, initiated in December 2016, to improve the Current and Upcoming Years FY Target 2021 TBD mid-FY 2020 2020 By September 30, 2020, 1. 140 NSF programs will have had reviewers view the presentation \"Tips on how to write better reviews.\" 2. 10,000 reviewers of NSF proposals will have viewed \"Tips on how to write better reviews\" prior to preparing written reviews. Reporting Year FY Target Result 2019 By September 30, 2019, 1. 60 NSF programs will have had reviewers view the presentation \"Tips on how to write better reviews.\" 2. 8,000 reviewers of NSF proposals will have viewed \"Tips on how to write better reviews\" prior to preparing wri tten reviews. 3. Improve the perceptions reported by survey respondents in a repeat survey of proposers and reviewers. Increase the percentage of PI survey respondents who agree that written reviews are thorough from a baseline of 55 percent (2015) to 57 percent in FY 2019. Increase the percentage of PI survey respondents who agree that written reviews are technically sou nd from a baseline of 63 percent (2015) to 65 percent in FY 2019. 1. Achieved . 2. Achieved 3. Achieved Previous Years 2018 By September 30, 2018, 1. 50 NSF programs will have held orientation sessions that include \"Tips on how to write better reviews.\" 2. 5000 reviewers of NSF proposals will have viewed \"Tips on how to write better reviews\" prior to preparing written reviews. 1. Achieved 2. Not achieved FY 2019 A nnual P erformance R eport and FY 2021 A nnual P erformance P lan Performance and Management - 18 quality of written reviews of NSF proposals. The pilot encourages NSF programs to use the video presentation \"Tips on how to write better reviews\" early in the review process to orient reviewers and provide i nformation on how to write more effective reviews. The assumption is that orienting reviewers before the reviews are written (as opposed to at the beginning of a review panel, at which time the reviews have been drafted but not finalized) helps reviewers better understand and apply the review criteria. The intention is to make written reviews more useful to both PIs and NSF program staff. Percentage of respondents identifying each item as the most significant improvement that could be made in the merit rev iew process.1 Discussion of FY 2019 Results Through September 30, 2019, reviewers across at least 296 programs viewed the orientation video, exceeding the target of 50 programs. 5,894 reviewers viewed the orientation video prior to preparing written reviews in FY 2019. Combined with the 3,022 reviewers viewing the video in FY 2018, this makes a total of 8,916 reviewers viewing the video , exceeding the target of 8 ,000 reviewers. The survey mentioned in FY 2019's third target was delayed by the lapse in appropriations. Preliminary data was used to assess this result. These data showed that 11,999 out of 18,632 respondents (64.4 percent) agreed or strongly agreed that written responses were thorough, and 12,950 out of 18,537 respondents (67.9 percent) agreed that written reviews are technically sound. These both exceed the targets of, respectively, 57 and 65 percent. FY 2020 and Planned FY 2021 Changes Development of FY 2021 targets for this goal is dependent on the results of the 2019 survey, which will not be available until mid -2020. At a high level, the goal \u2014to improve review quality \u2014remains highly relevant to NSF. Without the survey data, though, it is not possible to assess whether the current activities are having the desired impacts, so NSF is not yet in a position to decide which specific steps to take towards that end. T herefore, t argets will be deve loped in the second half of FY 2020 and published in the FY 2022 Plan/FY 2020 Report . The survey is biennial and will be fielded again in FY 2021. 1 FY 2015 Merit Review Report, p.126. www.nsf.gov/nsb/publications /2016/nsb201641.pdf FY 2021 Budget Request to Congress Performance and Management - 19 Goal 6, Foster a Culture of Inclusion Lead Organization: Office of Diversity and Inclusion (ODI) , Office of the Director. Goal Statement Foster a culture of inclusion through change management efforts resulting in change leadership and accountability. Measure, Milestone, or Deliverable Strategic Alignment Strategic Goal 3, Enhance NSF's performance of its mission. Objective 3.1, Human Capital: Attract, retain, and empower a talented and diverse workforce. About This Goal This goal incorporates principles from Renewing NSF, the agency operational reform pla n initiated in FY 2017 in response to M -17-22, \" Comprehensive Plan for Reforming the Federal Government .\" Fostering inclusive work environments and realizing the full potential of the workforce's diversity requires agencies to employ effective management practices. NSF values diversity and inclusion: by engaging the talent of all our workforce, individuals are empowered to realize their full potential; by insuring that our workforce is diverse, our collective ability to deliver on our scientific mission i s enhanced. NSF looks for ways to intensify and innovate diversity efforts through active leadership and including and engag ing everyone in the workplace . This goal will encourage leaders to participate in engagement initiatives being used around the Found ation, including, but not limited to: New Inclusion Quotient (New IQ) workshops, Diversity and Inclusion Dialogues, Workforce Inclusiveness Assessment, Special Emphasis observances, Employee Resource Groups, Unconscious bias awareness training, and Inclusion learning activities for all employees. Discussion of FY 2019 Results For FY 2019, NSF expanded this goal 's scope in two ways: to include all leaders, and to include participation in activities other than the New IQ that might contribute to culture change. Unrelated to this particular goal, NSF took steps in FY 2018 to help ensure that all NSF -funded research and learning environments are free from harassment by bolste ring policies, guidelines, and communications so that organizations clearly understand expectations and individuals understand their rights. Internally, the agency has promoted an identical set of expectations for its staff and leaders. In relating anti -harassment efforts to the aims of this goal, NSF determined that leadership's participation in anti- harassment and anti -bullying training had the potential to contribute to culture change, since it could not only help them identify and stop harassment and bu llying, but could actively promote an environment and a culture where all contributions are valued and everyone can reach their full potential . Current and Upcoming Years FY Target 2021 All NSF leaders will participate in culture change activities. 2020 Reporting Year FY Target Result 2019 In FY 2019, 100 percent of NSF leaders will participate in culture change activities. Not Achieved FY 2019 A nnual P erformance R eport and FY 2021 A nnual P erformance P lan Performance and Management - 20 Explanation of Unmet Goal To keep in the spirit of expanding the goal's scope to the entire agency, NSF in FY 2019 defined \"leaders\" broadly, to mean all managers and executives. To simplify measurement in the first year of the expanded goal scope, NSF defined \"participate in culture change activities\" narrowly, as completion of a new anti- harassment and anti -bully ing training module made available to all NSF staff . The training module was not available until the fourth quarter of FY 2019. Despite the late roll -out of the training, 55 percent of NSF staff completed both training modules in the last two months of FY 2019, including over half of managers and executives and over 80 percent of senior leaders. As of mid -January 2020, over 80 percent of NSF staff, including all senior leaders, have completed the training. FY 2020 and Planned FY 2021 Changes In FY 2020 emphasis on full completion of the anti -harassment and anti -bullying training by all staff will continue. The list of activities that will be considered to support culture change is anticipated to expand as more offerings are made available to NSF staff. Goal Change History While NSF has had a performance goal relating to diversity and inclusion since FY 2011, throughout the years, new directions have emerged under its umbrella . For five years, goals were largely focused on NSF's efforts to attain \"Model EEO Agency \" 2 status. Starting in FY 2016, this goal focused on inclusion, and New IQ workshops3 were made available to NSF staff . The focus on leadership represents a nother new direction for this goal in FY 2019. For more information on previous formulations of this goal , refer to the FY 2015 Annual Performance Report in the FY 2017 NSF Budget Request (Model EEO A 2018/FY 2020 APPR in FY NSF Budget Request (New IQ3). 2 nsf.gov/about/budget/fy2017/pdf/56_fy2017.pdf 3 nsf.gov/about/budget/fy2020/pdf/67_fy2020.pdf Previous Years (see \"Goal Change History\" for details) FY Target Summary Result 2018 1.

Measure, Milestone, or Deliverable Strategic Alignment Strategic Goal 3, Enhance NSF's performanc e of its mission. Objective 3.1, Human Capital: Attract, retain, and empower a talented and diverse workforce. About This Goal This goal incorporates principles from Renewing NSF, the agency operational reform plan initiated in FY 2017 in response to M-17-22, \" Comprehensive Plan for Reforming the Federal Government .\" Technological improvements have automated many tasks once performed by NSF staff. Requirements for NSF's administrative staff have evolved from the more traditional competencies related to general clerical and office tasks such as categorizing, processing, and tracking paper forms to more advanced competencies related to the use of multiple automated data systems. Additionally, the increasing number of proposals NSF receives, processed by the relatively stable number of program officers, means greater support is needed in data processing, data mining, analytics, and use of automated processes. Further, NSF is promoting transdisciplinary and convergent research and will need to ensure its current and future workforce can adapt to this convergent approach. NSF will review and realign its workforce to ensure its greatest resource -NSF staff -are equipped with the knowledge, skills, and abilities for success now and in the future. Ultimately, thi s will result in increased alignment between NSF's organizational structure, its core mission, and strategic plan. NSF will improve performance and increase accountability by systematically reviewing the NSF workforce from top to bottom. This review will allow NSF to revise position descriptions (PDs) that are outdated or do not reflect current and future work responsibilities. This PD modernization effort will enable NSF to identify the skills needed in today's work environment and will establish more re levant opportunities for training and developing NSF's existing workforce, while also enabling hiring managers to better target recruitment and outreach efforts to obtain the highest caliber of external candidates. Current and Upcoming Years FY Target 2021 In FY 2021, the Division of Human Resource Management will review, modernize, or eliminate 10 percent of the existing position descriptions requiring review. 2020 In FY 2020, the Division of Human Resource Management will review, modernize, or eliminate 10 percent of the existing position descriptions requiring review. Reporting Year FY Target Summary Result 2019 In FY 2019, the Division of Human Resource Management will review, modernize, or eliminate 10 percent of the existing position descriptions requiring review. Achieved Previous Year 2018 This goal was initiated in FY 2019 to replace a retired goal entitled \"Use Evidence to Guide Management Decisions,\" in which agency leaders used data -driven reviews to inform decision making . FY 2019 A nnual P 2021 A nnual P erformance P lan Performance and Management - 22 Discussion of FY 2019 Results In FY 2019, NSF first identified a pool of 400 PDs that had the potential for being either updated or eliminated, based on vacancy rate or consolidation with other types of positions. NSF then performed a more detailed review of the PDs to determine their relevanc e to the current ways in which NSF performs its mission, and decided whether the PD was a candid ate for updating or eliminating based on the current workforce management approaches of the rel evant offices and directorates. After confirming with managers to verify the outdated nature of the PDs, NSF eliminated 40 PDs in FY 2019. FY 2020 Planned FY 2021 Changes NSF anticipates continuing this goal's direction, reaching a cumulative 30 percent of existing PDs reviewed by the end of FY 2021. FY 2021 Budget Request to Congress Performance and Management - 23 Goal 8, Improve User Interactions with IT Systems Lead Organization: Office of the Chief Information Officer and the Division of Information Systems, Office of Information and Resource Management Goal Statement Streamline and simplify user interactions with IT systems and functions that support the merit review process, reducing non- value -added steps and reducing the time spent managing the proposal and award lifecycle. Measure, Milestone, or Deliverable Strategic Alignment Strategic Goal 3, Enhance NSF's performance of its mission. Objective 3.2, Processes and Operations: Continually improve agency operations. About This Goal This goal incorporates principles from Renewing NSF, the agency operational reform plan initiated in FY 2017 in response to M -17-22, \" Comprehensive Plan for Reforming the Federal Government .\" As part of the Renewing NSF principle to make IT Work For All , NSF will focus on leveraging state- of- the-art IT solutions to d evelop flexible tools and improve upon current service offerings in order to streamline and simplify the interactions that staff and the research community have with NSF's IT systems. This will help ensure that their time is spent on activities where they can add the most value instead of administrative activities, thereby helping the agency more effectively carry out its mission. As part of this effort, NSF will offer single points of access to both internal and external users for the IT services that they need, ensure that IT services have close to 100 percent availability with downtime for critical maintenance and service releases carefully coordinated to minimize disruption . In addition, NSF will utilize new IT solutions for automating non- value -added st eps for users, through services like robotic process automation. Current and Upcoming Years FY Target 2021 By the end of FY 2021, 1. NSF IT systems will have been available 99.6 percent of the time, excluding 469 hours of planned downtime. 2. 90 percent of internal merit review functions will be accessible through a single portal. 3. 68 percent of external merit review functions will be accessible through a single portal. 2020 By the end of FY 2020, 1. NSF IT systems will have been available 99.6 percent of the time, excluding 469 hours of planned downtime. 2. 86 percent of internal merit review functions will be accessible through a single portal. 3. 50 percent of external merit review functions will be accessible through a single portal.

Target 3 was met , with 32 percent of external merit review functions accessible through a single portal at the end of the FY. FY 2020 and Planned FY 2021 Changes NSF is planning to change the second and third targets to monitor the modernization of proposal submission functions. The set of functions that would be monitored has not been finalized at the time of publication, so specific targets will b e develope d in the second half of FY 2020 and published in the FY 2022 Plan/FY 2020 Report. FY 2021 Budget Request to Congress Performance and Management - 25 FY 2019 MANAGEMENT CHALLENGE PROGRESS REPORT Background Under the Reports Consolidation Act of 2000, NSF's Inspector General is required to summarize what it considers to be the most significant management and performance challenges facing NSF in the coming year in a memo to the NSF Director. The management challenges are identified by NSF's Inspector General and announced at the beginning of each fiscal year. In response, the Director issues a memo to acknowledge receipt o f the OIG Management Challenges and to provide a report on NSF's progress and achievements made over the prior year. The OIG's challenges, NSF's response, and NSF's progress update towards addressing previously identified challenges are included in the an nual Agency Financial Report (AFR) published in November on NSF's website. 1 This section provides NSF's progress report highlighting the sign ificant actions taken in FY 2019 on the management challenges identified by NSF's Inspector General at the beginni ng of that fiscal year. Enterprise Risk Management Starting in FY 2018, NSF 's Progress Report applied its Enterprise Risk Management framework to document its assessments of the inherent and residual risks for each of the OIG's Challenges, including actio ns to mitigate risks. NSF management's overview of the challenges presented represent NSF's view of the residual risk in light of the key actions NSF has already taken to address the OIG -identified challenge . Further, NSF management developed the anticipat ed milestones in consideration of NSF's strategic objectives, the risks inherent to NSF's work, and the key actions NSF has already taken to address those risks. In response to NSF's incorporation of ERM principles in its FY 2018 report, the OIG updated its reporting format for FY 2019, and recognized NSF's progress by removing one Management Challenge cited for FY 2019, e liminating improper payments . In FY 2018, the OIG identified foreign talent plans as an emerging challenge area for FY 2019. OIG's inclusion of an emerging challenge in its FY 2019 Report enabled NSF to undertake responsive actions in FY 2019. The OIG made mitigating threats from foreign government talent recruitment programs a standalone challenge for FY 2020, and a progress report on this new challenge is included below . FY 2019 Management Challenges Managing major multi- user research facilities Meeting Digital Accountability and Transparency Act of 2014 (DATA Act) reporting requirements Eliminating improper payments Managing the Intergovernmental Personnel Act (IPA) Program Managing the U.S. Antarctic Program Encouraging the ethical conduct of research FY 2020 Management Challenges Managing major multi- user research facilities Meeting Digital Accountability and Transparency Act of 2014 (DATA Act) reporting requirements Managing the Intergovernmental Personnel Act (IPA) Program Managing the U.S. Antarctic Program Encouraging the ethical conduct of research Mitigating threats posed by foreign government talent recruitment programs 1 www.nsf.gov/about/performance Performance and Management Performance and Management - 26 Mitigating T hreats Posed by Foreign Government Talent Recruitment Programs NSF lead: Office Head, Office of I nternational Science and Engineering Summary of OIG Identified Challenge a) Foreign government talent recruitment programs designed to benefit the foreign state by obtaining information and technology from abroad have the potential to exploit the openness of American universities and threaten the integrity of U.S. research initiatives. Talent recruitment programs target individuals with expertise in cutting- edge science, including NSF -funded researchers, merit review panelists, and career Federal employees or rotators who manage NSF's scientific programs. b) Failure to disclose membership in such programs can have ramifications. c) There is risk of fraud, waste, or abuse of NSF or other Government assets. NSF Management's Overview of the Challenge and Action Plan to Address and Monitor the Challenge NSF is committed to sustaining Americas' innovation leadership, economic strength, and national security, including the basic research ecosystem that underpins it. The values of openness, transparency, merit -based competition, and reciprocal collaboration are essential to the functioning of that basic research ecosystem. The maintenance of a vibrant and diverse research community - including both domestic and international talent - is also essential. However, our sc ience and engineering enterprise is put at risk when some foreign governments endeavor to benefit from the global research ecosystem without upholding these values. Certain foreign -government -sponsored talent recruitment programs create new risks to the in tegrity of the ecosystem, including to NSF's mission and merit -review process. Faced with such a risk, NSF is responding. The White House Office of Science and Technology Policy (OSTP) launched the Joint Committee on the Research Environment (JCORE) under the National Science and Technology Council on May 6, 2019, including a subcommittee on research security co- chaired by NSF. Under the leadership of OSTP, U.S. science funding agencies are committed to taking a risk -based approach to strike an appropriate balance between fostering the open and internationally collaborative environment that has contributed to the success of the U.S. research enterprise and mitigating emerging threats to the integrity of that enterprise. NSF also co-chairs a second JCORE sub committee on coordinating administrative requirements for research across the science funding agencies , including those associated with research security . NSF is not the only agency or party involved in this important challenge, but we have a vital role to play. We work closely with other U.S. government science agencies to share policies and practices, and regularly engage with the academic research community to hear their concerns about this emerging challenge and clarify our positions, policies, and procedures. NSF's Corrective Measures to Address the Challenge Demonstrated Progress T hrough Agency Actions Taken in FY 2019 Released a Dear Colleague Letter on Research Protection to the research community from Director C\u00f3rdova . Co-chaired the White H ouse's National Science and Technology Committee's JCORE subcommittee on research security; co -chaired the JCORE subcommittee on coordinating administrative requirements for research; engaged regularly with other U.S. agencies that fund basic research - including NIH, DOE, and USDA\u2014and the State Department on science and security. Appointed top NSF leadership (i.e., the Head of the Office of International Science and Engineering ) as the NSF lead on science and security; established a working group of Senior Executive Service- level leaders from relevant NSF Directorates and the Office of the Director; took a risk -based approach to protecting the basic research ecosystem. FY 2021 Budget Request to Congress Performance and Management - 27 Increased capacity by hiring a new Program Manager who reports to the Head of the Office of International Science and Engineering with expertise in science and security as well as foreign talent programs. Issued a policy making it clear that NSF personnel and IPAs detailed to NSF cannot participate in foreign government talent recruitment pro grams ; released a memo on research protection announcing the personnel policy to all NSF staff from Chief Operating Officer Crim. Issued a note to NSF staff reminding everyone that government ethics regulations require accurate and timely financial disclos ure reports and that Federal ethics rules apply to both our career and rotator personnel. Analyzed the problem internally and with the assistance of external expertise; commissioned the independent scientific advisory group JASON to conduct a study on fundamental research and national security with the direction that it should include recommendations on ways for NSF and grantee institutions to achieve the best balance between scientific openness and security. Sought best practices through sessions with the National Science Board, the Advisory Committee on International Science and Engineering, and the Advisory Com mittee to the Directorate for Biological Sciences. Clarified requirements in the draft Proposal and Award Policies and Procedures Guide (PAPPG) regarding submission of information on: Current and pending support Professional appointments Responsible and ethical conduct of research and the peer review process Communicated to the research community to increase awareness of the risks and compliance with the requirements; clarified PAPPG requirements and NSF's positions, policies, and procedures through presentations to multiple research community groups including the National Council of University Research Administrators, Council on Govern ment Relations, Federal Demonstration Partnership, American Association of Universities, and National Academies of Science, Engineering and Medicine's Committee on Science, Engineering, Medicine, and Public Policy. Continue to communicate all of our action s and updates to our committees of jurisdiction in the House and Senate. NSF's Anticipated Action Plan Milestones Continue coordinating with the U.S. interagency including through supporting and complementing OSTP's actions, co -chairing the JCORE subcommi ttee on research security, and advancing work along the subcommittee's four lines of effort: Coordinating outreach and engagement with federal agencies, academic research institutions, companies, non- governmental organizations, researchers, and students. Establishing and coordinating disclosure requirements for participating in the federally- funded research enterprise. Developing best practices for academic research institutions, in collaboration with academia, professional societies, and other organizations. Developing methods for identification, assessment, and management of risk in the research enterprise. Release the final 2020 PAPPG , including clarifications regarding disclosure requirements, along with publishing in the Federal Register responses to pu blic comments on the draft PAPPG. Streamline the process for providing disclosures to NSF by implementing electronic formats for submission of biographical sketches and current and pending support information. Anticipate receipt of independent third -party report from JASON related to fundamental research and national security; convene Senior Executive Service- level leaders from relevant NSF Directorates to Performance and Management Performance and Management - 28 evaluate the recommendations and, where appropriate, begin implementing; share the report publicly via the NSF website and encourage grantee institutions to consider its recommendations. Finalize a required training course for all NSF staff that defines the problem and why disclosure of all sources of support i s vital to maintaining our robust research ecosystem and protecting taxpayer dollars. Continue and finalize actions taken in FY 2019. FY 2021 Budget Request to Congress Performance and Management - 29 Managing Major Multi -User Research Facilities Co-Lead s: Chief Financial Officer and Chief Officer for Research Facilities Summary of OIG Identified Challenge a) Manage inherent risk associated with previously highlighted concerns including unsupported proposal budgets, management fees and contingency funds, and the absence of certified earned value managemen t systems. b) Strengthen controls around subrecipients, subrecipient risk assessments and proper charging of construction and operations expenditures. c) Manage the risk of cost or schedule increases for major facilities in construction. NSF Management's Over view of the Challenge and Action Plan to Address and Monitor the Challenge NSF understands the importance of its role in overseeing recipients' on- going management of major facility awards. The agency also recognizes the importance of assessing prospective recipients' capabilities for managing major facilities prior to award. Over the past several years, NSF has been in the process of strengthening its policies and procedures as illustrated below. This includes an annual Major Facilities Portfolio Risk Asse ssment to determine the necessary reviews and audits to be conducted by the Office of Budget, Finance and Award Management's (BFA) Large Facilities Office (LFO) and Cooperative Support Branch (CSB) within the Division of Acquisition and Cooperative Support (DACS). In close cooperation with NSF program offices, LFO and CSB conduct these reviews to safeguard NSF's significant, long- term investments in supporting the scientific endeavor. NSF leadership has shown its commitment to oversight in the past several years by strengthening the LFO and in establishing the Chief Officer for Research Facilities (CORF) position in the Office of the Director. The governance structure currently in place continues to help ensure consistent implementation of NSF's expanded con trols for major facilities oversight. NSF has recently undergone two Government Accountability Office (GAO) reviews related to its oversight of major facilities. The June 2018 report entitled National Science Foundation: Revised Policies on Developing Co sts and Schedules Could Improve Estimates for Large Facilities (GAO- 18-370) recommended that NSF should revise its policies for estimating and reviewing the costs and schedules of major facility projects to better incorporate the best practices in GAO's gu ides. The March 2019 report entitled National Science Foundation: Cost and Schedule Performance of Large Facilities Construction Projects and Opportunities to Improve Project Management (GAO- 19-227) recommended that NSF conduct a workforce gap analysis for project management competencies, ensure recipients provide lessons learned and best practices to NSF, and establish criteria for recipient project management competencies to be incorporated into NSF's review process. NSF agreed with the GAO recommendation s and has Corrective Action Plans (CAPs) in place as described below. Based on NSF's risk -based evaluation of this Management Challenge, coupled with activities already completed and those planned for FY 2020, NSF has determined that the residual risk imp act for cost overruns is \"very low\" and the likelihood is \"low.\" NSF is confident that its current and planned policies and procedures related to major facility cost and schedule oversight adequately consider and balance risk, resources, benefit to the sci ence community, and stewardship of federal funds. NSF's Corrective Measures to Address the Challenge Demonstrated Progress Through Agency Action Taken in Prior Fiscal Years Strengthened controls over NSF's major facility portfolio in FY 2016 and FY 2017 based on the 2015 National Academy of Public Administration report recommendations and requirements in the American Innovation and Competitiveness Act of 2017 (AICA): Retaining a portion of the project budget contingency.

Developed the Minimum Core Competency for Oversight of Major Facilities SOG to codify the minimum competencies for the core IPT members. Conducted an independent third- party review of NSF's strengthened policies and procedures related to cost surveillance. Updated the DACS/CSB Standardized Cost Analysis Guidance SOG to include assessment of schedule due to the potential impact on costs. Revised and aligned BFA SOGs related to standardized cost analysis and pre- award budget reviews to specifically address AICA requirements and GAO good practices. Demonstrated Progress through Agency Actions Taken in FY 2019 Finalized Selection of Independent Cost Estimate Review s SOG already implemented in practice as part of the CAP for GAO- 18-370. Revised the Major Facilities Guide (MFG), formerly the LFM, to inc orporate GAO good practices on costs and to reserve a new section (4.3) on Schedule Development, Estimating, and Analysis as part of the CAP for GAO- 18-370 and to include a requirement for Segregation of Funding Plans (section 3.4) and guidance on Final Construction Reviews (section 2.4.2). Received notification in September 2019 from GAO that the analysis by the GAO engineering sciences team found that NSF's practices in the new Major Facilities Guide and internal standard operating guidance fully meet GAO good practices. Drafted the Major Facilities Oversight Reviews SOG to more fully utilize external review panels in addressing elements of cost and schedule as part of the CAP for GAO -18-370.

Draft new MFG Section on Key Personnel and release for public comment as part of CAP for GAO- 19-227. Performance and Management Performance and Management - 32 Meeting DATA Act Reporting R equirements Lead: Chief Financial Officer and Office Head, OIRM Summary of OIG Identified Challenge NSF must report DATA Act information in accordance with government -wide financial data standards developed and issued by the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) and the U.S. Department of the Treasury. NSF Management's Overview of the Challenge and Action Plan to Address and Monitor the Challenge Each quarter, NSF successfully submits all DATA Act -required data to the U.S. Department of Treasury to be easily accessible t o the public through USASpending.gov. In addition to these submissions, which began in April 2017, NSF is an integral part of the government -wide Chief Financial Officers Council (CFOC) and Council of Inspectors General on Integrity and Efficiency (CIGIE) communities that have worked collaboratively to ensure new OMB guidance and Treasury protocols appropriately align with audit community standards. Both councils are working to enhance not only the quality of government -wide spending data, but also the gove rnment's ability to assess that quality. As a result of this work, NSF implemented a data quality plan that is based on a government -wide model and conducted a risk assessment demonstrating that it has implemented internal controls to mitigate the risks associated with maintaining and publishing inaccurate spending data. NSF continues to deploy top leadership commitment to the management of its DATA Act program, including the agency CFO who serves as the Senior Accountable Official (SAO), the Deputy CFO, an executive- level Steering Committee, and several additional high- level executives and senior staffers. In FY 2019, NSF continued to take actions in accordance with the recommendations from the NSF OIG's audit of NSF's FY 2017 second quarter spending data that were resolved and closed in FY 2018. These actions made progress to address the OIG finding that the data did not meet the then- current OMB quality requirements for accuracy, completeness and timeliness, noting that some of the errors were due to NSF reporting while others were caused by government -wide reporting issues. NSF conducted a root cause analysis of its challenges and noted that many of the OIG -identified errors were government -wide in nature and beyond NSF's control. NSF implemented a CAP af ter the FY 2017 audit, ultimately resolving all recommendations and the OIG has closed them all. Indeed, in the description of the FY 2019 DATA Act Management Challenge, the OIG noted that it is \"encouraged by NSF's actions to improve its DATA Act reportin g.\" NSF has had a recognized history of outstanding government -wide DATA Act -related collaboration. In FY 2019, NSF intensified its leadership and engagement in this area not only to support government -wide DATA Act -related activities, but also to ensure that the developing standards in this area evolved to align with best practices and good governance for agencies like NSF. In FY 2019, NSF collaborated and led government -wide activities implementing now -current guidance, OMB M -18-16, updating Appendix A to OMB Circular No. A -123, Management of Reporting and Data Integrity Risk. This new guidance superseded prior DATA Act guidance and created a requirement for agencies to develop data quality plans that include management assurance of the quality of agency data. NSF's progress on the DATA Act has been aided by the NSF Deputy CFO and other staff deeply engaging in supporting the activities relating to the Audit Collaboration Working Group of the CFOC and CIGIE. NSF was a major contributor in developing the Data Quality Plan Playbook, which serves as a reference guide for agencies designing their data quality plans. The CFOC also collaborated with GAO and CIGIE as they developed new audit guidelines and standards consistent with the new OMB guidance. In addit ion, the NSF Division Director for BFA's Division of Institution and Award Support and other NSF senior staff supported the government -wide financial assistance community's work to develop a framework for the required data quality plans, which NSF leverage d to prepare its own plan. FY 2021 Budget Request to Congress Performance and Management - 33 As part of its work to achieve reasonable assurance for internal controls over DATA Act reporting, NSF leveraged enterprise risk management to assess the risk of reporting inaccurate data to Treasury. Based on this evaluation and considering the causes analyzed and actions that NSF has taken to date, NSF believes that its risk of reporting inaccurate, incomplete, and untimely data has been mitigated. NSF's Corrective Measures to Address the Challenge Demonstrated Progress Through Agency Action Taken in Prior Fiscal Years Developed and implemented CAP in response to the FY 2017 audit with the following actions: Examined processes identified as potential audit risks, identified ways to improve or strengthen the processes, and docume nted changes in NSF's standard operating procedures. Submitted corrections for data errors identified in the audit. Included comments with NSF's submissions to explain legitimate differences between File C (Award and Financial Detail) and Files D1/D2 (Fina ncial Assistance and Procurement Award and Awardee Attributes). Reviewed submission process with the internal controls team and identified opportunities for improvement. Performed policy review of the application of \"legitimate differences\" guidance to war nings when linking Files C to D1/D2. Worked closely with the DATA Act Audit Collaboration Working Group of the CFOC and CIGIE to identify issues to improve DATA Act implementation and clarify government -wide guidance and audit standards. Worked with a subgroup of the Financial Assistance Committee for E -Government (FACE) in collaboration with a DATA Act Internal Control subgroup of the CFOC to provide a solid framework and data quality plan template that agencies can leverage and customize to develop their own data quality plans. Initiated implementation of OMB Circular A -123 Appendix A, requiring agencies to maintain a d ata quality plan that considers the incremental risks to data quality in federal spending data and any controls that would manage such risks. NSF's data quality plan will leverage the existing plans for the Financial (Files A -C) and Procurement (File D1) data as well incorporate the new data quality requirements for the Financial Assistance (File D2) data. Reviewed SharePoi nt processes to ensure all required BFA Division Director validations are complete, properly labelled, and available for SAO review. Demonstrated Progress through Agency Actions Taken in FY 2019 Devoted the staff resources to actively participate in the CFOC DATA Act Information Model Schema (DAIMS) workgroup on data quality improvements, which is a cross -agency group led by Treasury for introducing potential improvements to the DAIMS specificatio ns for improving data quality on USASpending.gov. NSF worked to get the issue with zip codes resolved and incorporated in to DAIMS v1.3 specifications. Continued ongoing work, through the NSF Deputy CFO and staff, with the joint working group of the CFO C and the CIGIE to provide input and recommendations around the next iteration of DATA Act policies, internal control, and audit guidance to OMB, Treasury, and CIGIE. Committed the NSF Deputy CFO to leading a subgroup on internal controls, serving as primary author of a government -wide DATA Act Playbook, and actively participating in developing best practices for financial assistance data quality. Instituted processes to monitor and independently validate the effectiveness and sustainability of its data qual ity measures. The NSF DATA Act Work Group (DAWG) worked with appropriate Performance and Management Performance and Management - 34 stakeholders from the Internal Controls and Enterprise Risk Management groups in developing and executing a data quality plan that defines NSF's FY 2019 approach to achieve reasonable assurance for internal control over quarterly DATA Act reporting. The plan was prepared in accordance with OMB M-18-16, Appendix A to OMB Circular No. A -123. Conducted a risk assessment of the 57 essential reporting elements related to procurement, financ ial management and financial assistance data and submission processes and reviewed related system controls and Standard Operating Procedures (SOPs). Performed analysis of NSF's submission warnings to provide warning rationales, counts, and frequency of eac h identified warning during the execution phase of the data quality plan . This practice will continue with each quarterly submission and be reported in the annual assurance document. Updated documentation of DATA Act processes including, the DATA Act SOPs, Financial Assistance Broker Submission Standard Operating Guidance (FABS SOG) , and NSF Acquisition Manual. Continued to monitor system processes to ensure data integrity and accuracy . Remained up- to-date with Treasury DAIMS specifications by making appro priate changes as well as introduced operational improvements to FABS file generation. Created a desk guide for the NSF Contracts Branch that includes step-by-step instructions intended to reduce recurring data errors. Added additional dry run and pre -validations between data submission quarters to increase accuracy. Incorporated lessons learned from feedback on data submissions to improv e accuracy and efficiencies. NSF's Anticipated Action Plan Milestones Implementing a SharePoint tool to assist in quarte rly DATA Act submission process by tracking Division Director assurances and the SAO certification . Continuing to work closely with OMB, Treasury, and intra -governmental groups. Continuing to refin e our validation and submission process . Continuing stewardship collaboration with NSF O IG and GAO to cooperate with and support their audit responsibilities and to resolve any recommendations through implementing a corrective action plan. FY 2021 Budget Request to Congress Performance and Management - 35 Eliminating Im proper Payments Lead: Chief Financial Officer Summary of OIG Identified Challenge a) There is a risk of fraud, waste, or abuse of NSF or other government assets. In addition, this challenge involves an operation that is related to key initiatives of the Pre sident. b) NSF's risk assessment process needed significant improvements to ensure that the agency thoroughly assesses and documents its risk of improper payments, and c) addresses the limitations in NSF's analysis of the OMB risk factors. NSF Management's Ov erview of the Challenge and Action Plan to Address and Monitor the Challenge NSF addressed the OIG's recommendations from the previous OIG reports. As a result, the OIG has determined that NSF was in compliance with the Improper Payment Elimination and Rec overy Act (IPERA) risk for the years 2015 through 2018. This validates that NSF has taken the steps necessary to demonstrate compliance and effectiveness in the agency's implementation of IPERA. NSF has: Demonstrated strong commitment and top leadership support to incorporate risk management concepts into business processes and management functions. Participated in the government -wide working group for the cross -agency priority goal on Getting Payments Right. Ensured that NSF has the people and resources to effectively comply with IPERA by assigning a senior staff associate responsible for coordinating and integrating risk management and program integrity activities. Developed and completed a corrective action plan in July 2016 that addressed th e root causes of the IPERA reporting issue, implemented solutions, and completed all OIG recommendations. Developed a corrective action plan following the FY 2018 IPERA Performance Audit. Established processes to monitor and validate the effectiveness and sustainability of the corrective measures. Incorporated corrective measures into policy and process documentation. NSF's Corrective Measures to Address the Challenge Demonstrated Progress Through Agency Action Taken in Prior Fiscal Years Developed and published a SOG for improper payments risk reviews incorporating the nine IPERA risk factors and additional considerations from the OIG review report. Completed improper payments risk reviews for FY 2016 and FY 2017. The risk reviews includ ed input from subject matter experts for grants, contracts, charge cards, and payments to employees. Both reviews concluded that NSF did not have a significant risk of improper pa yments. OIG inspection of the FY 2016 and FY 2017 risk reviews found NSF in c ompliance with IPERA requirements. Collaborated with the OIG, BFA, and program offices on risk reduction activities including completion of an initial fraud risk assessment for grants under the Fraud Reduction and Data Analytics Act. Completed an improper payments risk assessment for FY 2018 that built on the improper payments risk reviews completed during FY 2016 and FY 2017. Demonstrated Progress through Agency Actions Taken in FY 2019 Conducted advanced and baseline grant monitoring activities including grant payment testing. Operated, evaluated, and reported on an effective internal controls program providing assurance that NSF controls over grants and grant payment processes are properly designed and operating effectively. Performance and Management Performance and Management - 36 Completed an IPERA risk review during FY 2019 as a continuation of NSF's three -year risk assessment cycle following standard operating guidance establishing a validated measure of performance in terms of monitoring improper payment risk. OIG found that NSF complied with IPERA reportin g requirements based on review of NSF's Agency Financial Report and risk assessment. This is the fourth consecutive year NSF has been found compliant. Completed action items set forth in the CAP from the FY 2018 IPERA Performance Audit. NSF's Anticipated Action Plan Milestones Continue advanced and baseline grant monitoring activities including grant payment testing. Continue internal controls program activities to provide assurance that NSF controls for its payment processes are operating effectively. Continue collaboration with the OIG on risk reduction activities. Continue to improve improper payments risk assessment and reporting compliance activities. FY 2021 Budget Request to Congress Performance and Management - 37 Managing the IPA Program Co-Leads: Assistant Director, BIO and Office Head, OIRM Summary of OIG Identified Challenge a) Because individuals serve in a temporary capacity for up to 4 years, there is frequent turnover in staff at NSF, especially in senior leadership positions filled by IPAs. b) IPAs can spend up to 50 days each year on Independent Research/Development (IR/D). c) IPAs are not subject to Federal pay and benefits limits. NSF Management's Overview of the Challenge and Action Plan to Address and Monitor the Challenge NSF provides the opportunity for scientists, engineers, and educator s to rotate into the Foundation as temporary Program Directors, advisors, and leaders. Rotators bring fresh perspectives from across the country and across all fields of science and engineering supported by the Foundation, helping influence new directions for research in science, engineering, and education, including emerging interdisciplinary areas. Many of these rotators remain involved in their professional research and development activities while working at NSF through participation in the IR/D program , which is managed by the NSF IR/D Council. NSF takes a proactive approach in the management of the IPA Program to appropriately consider and mitigate inherent risks associated with its execution. Demonstrated Top Leadership Commitment: The IPA Steering Committee reports directly to NSF Director France A. C\u00f3rdova and Chief Operating Officer (COO) F. Fleming Crim and has been in place since April 2016. The IPA Steering Committee is comprised of senior -level leadership across the agency, namely a Chair and Vice -Chair who are part of the agency's Senior Executive Service (SES), the Chairs of the NSF Executive Resources Board (ERB) and IR/D Council, Head of the Office of Diversity and Inclusion, and four at -large members, including two SES and two executive -level IPAs. The IPA Steering Committee is charged with ensuring NSF is best utilizing the IPA hiring authority. It advises the Foundation's senior leadership on matters that directly concern policy on the use of the IPA Program, and on common approaches to budgeting and implementation of the program. It also regularly reports on its oversight and stewardship of the IPA Program, including costs associated with the program, to the Director and COO, to OMB, and to Congress, pursuant to the AICA. Capacity: The IPA Steering Committee is supported in the execution of its responsibilities by various NSF units with key expertise for risk management, reporting, and accountability, including BFA, the OIRM's Division of Human Resource Management, the Offi ce of General Counsel (OGC), the Office of Legislative and Public Affairs, and the Office of Integrative Activities. Demonstrated Progress: NSF is constantly improving its management of the IPA Program and addressing the management challenges identified b y the OIG as well as other agency -identified risks and challenges. In this way, NSF is ensuring the program fully supports the mission of the agency and the nation's interests. Indeed, NSF believes that the steps taken to date as described above have reduced the inherent risk substantially, such that the residual risk is acceptable to the agency. NSF's Corrective Measures to Address the Challenge Demonstrated Progress Through Agency Action Taken in Prior Fiscal Years Performance and Management Performance and Management - 38 a) Because individuals serve in a temporar y capacity for up to 4 years, there is frequent turnover in staff at NSF, especially in senior leadership positions filled by IPAs. Ensured there is a \"bench\" of staff ready for developmental detail assignments to vacant executive positions through the Fed eral Executive Institute (FEI), American University Executive Leadership Program, Harvard Business School Leadership Training, Individual Development Plans, and NSF Academy Leadership Development Program. Implemented the New Executive Transition Program (N eXT) in 2009 to onboard employees and IPAs transitioning into executive -level positions to help new executives reach full performance as quickly as possible by developing executive knowledge about NSF mission, culture, organization, people, and business pr ocesses. Instituted mandatory and optional training for Program Officers, including IPAs, on NSF's Merit Review process which teaches how research proposals are evaluated and how to execute the Program Officer role. Created a parallel performance managem ent system in 2014 for IPAs to ensure clarity in setting expectations and providing feedback on performance. Established a knowledge transfer process in 2015 that exiting executives can use to transfer knowledge and information to incoming executives. Implemented a required three- day supervisory training and development course in 2015 called Federal Supervision at NSF designed to assist new federal supervisors (including IPAs) in understanding their roles and all the requirements pertaining to federal huma n capital management. Established a Steering Committee for Policy and Oversight of the IPA Program (IPA Steering Committee) in April 2016 to serve as the primary body for considering policy on NSF's use of IPAs, and to oversee common approaches to budgeti ng and implementation of the IPA program. Conducted analysis (January 2018) on IPA years of service and found that, on average, IPA executives serve 3.1 years at NSF and are 3 times more likely to stay for 3 -4 years compared to staff-level IPAs. Non- execu tives serve, on average, 2.3 years at NSF. Per OPM, the average time a career SES spends in a position is 3.4 years and non -career SES is 1.7 years. 2 Engaged with the GAO on an inquiry into the turnover of IPAs. b) IPAs can spend up to 50 days each year on Independent Research/Development (IR/D). Established the IR/D Council in October 2011 to develop and monitor internal controls related to the IR/D Program , including tracking the time spent on IR/D activities. Data from these internal controls are disseminated to NSF senior management quarterly for use in managing the IR/D Program within each organization. Developed an IR/D Guide in 2012 to clearly communic ate NSF policies on the use of IR/D, including the possibility that participation in the IR/D Program could be curtailed if it compromised the completion of NSF duties. Designated IR/D experts in each Directorate/Office who receive annual training to ensure that NSF policies are implemented appropriately. Instituted a requirement that all IR/D plans provide an explanation of how the IR/D activities enhance the requestor's ability to perform NSF duties. Published a revised IR/D Guide in January 2017 tha t includes guidance limiting NSF payment of IPAs' IR/D travel to their home institutions to 12 trips per year. The guidance encourages IPAs Budget Request Congress Performance and Management - 39 combine other NSF official business and/or telework with these trips to more efficient ly use of those travel doll ars. Delivered a \"Benefits of the NSF IR/D Program\" report to the NSF Deputy Assistant Directors (DADs ) in March 2018 highlighting the value of IR/D in recruitment, research currency, and ethics protection. Submitted the IR/D Annual Report to the DADs (November 2018) , indicating that on average 75% of IPAs participated in IR/D, up from 72% in the prior year. On average, IPA IR/D plans requested 38 days of IR/D, yet only 19 days were used. As of October 2018, active IR/D plans for IPAs totaled $1.48 M reque sted with an expected actual spend of approximately $750,000. c) IPAs are not subject to Federal pay and benefits limits. NSF initiated a pilot requiring 10% cost sharing by IPAs' home institutions of their academic -year salaries and fringe benefits (per NSF Bulletin 16- 11). This pilot applies to all new IPA agreements initiated in FY 2017 and beyond, including those for executive and program level staff. Additionally, NSF eliminated reimbursement for lost consulting. Received notice from the OIG in February 2017 closing the sole open audit recommendation related to IPA costs because of cost reduction efforts undertaken by NSF. Extended the c ost-share pilot into FY 2018 to continue to evaluate the effectiveness of the 10% cost-share requirement. An evaluatio n of the effectiveness of the p ilot launched in FY 2017 indicated a cost -share percentage increase from 7.2% in FY 2016 to 7.9% in FY 2017, which result ed in an average cost -share increase of almost $5,000 per IPA assignment. Engaged with the GAO on the s alary reimbursements associated with IPAs. NSF does not set the salaries for rotators who are detailed to NSF using the IPA authority because their salaries are set by their home institutions. Submitted to Congress responses to the AICA (P.L. 114 -329 Secti on 111 on Personnel Oversight regarding the Justifications for Rotator Pay Exceeding the SES Pay Max and Evaluation of the Cost-sharing Pilot (January 2018). Demonstrated Progress through Agency Actions Taken in FY 2019 a) Because individuals serve in a temp orary capacity for up to 4 years, there is frequent turnover in staff at NSF, especially in senior leadership positions filled by IPAs . Deliver ed the first IPA Program Annual Report to the Director of NSF. This report provide s annual data and trend analyses on various aspects related to the use of IPAs at NSF for use by the Director and NSF senior managers in assessing and overseeing the program. Developed the CAP response to the GAO report, A Workforce Strategy and Evaluation of Results Could Improve Use of Rotating Scientists, Engineers, and Educators (GAO- 18-533). b) IPAs can spend up to 50 days each year on Independent Research/Development (IR/D). Monitor ed time spent on IR/D by both permanent and rotating staff, and provide d quarterly data to NSF senior managers to ensure appropriate oversight of IR/D. Performed yearly data check to assure that no IPA IR/D participant travel was paid by NSF in excess of 12 trips per year. c) IPAs are not subject to Federal pay and benefits limits. Extended the c ost-share pilot into FY 2019 to continue to evaluate the effectiveness of the 10% cost-share requirement. A cost analysis of the IPA pilot launched for FY 2017 indicated a cost - share percentage increase from 7.2% in FY 2016 to 9.1% in FY 2018. Performance and Management Performance and Management - 40 Submitted to Congress annual responses to the AICA (P.L. 114- 329 Section 111 on Personnel Oversight) on the Justifications for Rotator Pay Exceeding the SES Pay Max. NSF's Anticipated Action Plan Milestones a) Because individuals serve in a temporary capacity for up to 4 years, there is frequent turnover in staff at NSF, especially in senior leadership positions filled by IPAs. Submit the IPA Program Annual Report covering the prior fiscal year to the Director of NSF. Integrate activities associated with the CAP in response to GAO -18-533 into Renewing NSF goal 1 Adapting the Workforce to the Work. b) IPAs can spend up to 50 days each year on Independent Research/Development (IR/D). Provide quarterly data to NSF senior managers to ensure appropriate oversight of IR/D time and travel by both permanent and rotating staff. Continue to perform yearly data check to assure that there are no IPA IR/D participants where NSF payment of travel to their home institutions exceeds 12 trips per year. c) IPAs are not subject to Federal pay and benefits limits. Submit to Congress annual responses to the AICA on the Justi fications for Rotator Pay Exceeding the SES Pay Max. FY 2021 Budget Request to Congress Performance and Management - 41 Managing the U.S. Antarctic Program (USAP) Co-Leads: Assistant Director, GEO, and Office Director, Polar Programs Summary of OIG Identified Challenge a) Fiscal oversight of the Antarctic Support Contractor (ASC) and its subcontractors. b) Management of inventory. c) Health and safety of research and contractors. d) Modernization of facilities in the Antarctic Infrastructure Modernization for Science (AIMS) Project . NSF Management's Overview of the Challenge and Action Plan to Address and Monitor the Challenge NSF\u2014through the Office of Polar Programs (OPP) in the Directorate for Geosciences (GEO) \u2014funds and manages the U.S. Antarctic Program (USAP) . The USAP supports United States' research and national policy goals in the Antarctic. The inherent risks associated with Antarctica's remote location, extreme environment, and the short period of time during which the continent is accessible has led to m anagement challenges for NSF in the areas of: a) fiscal oversight of the ASC and its subcontractors; b) management of inventory; c) health and safety of researchers and contractors; and d) modernization of facilities in the AIMS project. Through leadershi p commitments, dedication of staff and resources, corrective action planning, and monitoring implementation of plans, NSF has demonstrated significant progress in reducing the inherent risk to residual risk levels for USAP management that are well within a cceptable ranges. The transition of the ASC responsibilities to Leidos has occurred without disruptions in operations or unwarranted increases in cost. Management controls and operating procedures are in place to monitor invoice processing, systems perform ance, indirect rates, and financial reporting for the USAP contractor. NSF performed root cause analyses of issues pertaining to the shipment and storage of property and inventory, and consequently developed and implemented process improvements. Routine NS F-led meetings are held with Leidos to emphasize prime contractor responsibilities to protect government property and inventory. All 2015 OIG misconduct -related action items, as expressed in the Audit of Health and Safety in the U.S. Antarctic Program , wer e closed by the OIG. NSF and USAP efforts continue to take positive steps to ensure USAP is well poised to address misconduct in the future through implementation of NSF processes for reporting and reviewing Code of Conduct violations. Additionally, NSF is closely monitoring Care Point's implementation of the selected pharmacy management software system. Planning and implementation of the modernization of McMurdo Station and other large facilities work in Antarctica are underway with cognizance by the National Science Board (NSB), OMB, and Congress. NSF successfully completed the AIMS Final Design Review (FDR) in Q1 of FY 2019, and the NSB authorized NSF to proceed with AIMS construction. NSF continues to engage the scientific community in efforts to minimiz e disruption that the AIMS construction process might have on Antarctic science. NSF developed a 5 -year long- range capital plan to include lifecycle and real property investments for all Antarctic locations and is working to extend that plan to a 10- year h orizon. NSF's Corrective Measures to Address the Challenge Demonstrated Progress Through Agency Action Taken in Prior Fiscal Years a) Fiscal oversight of the Antarctic Support Contractor (ASC) and its subcontractors. Held routine executive meetings with Loc kheed Martin leadership to understand the strategic rationale for the transition to Leidos and the impact to the ASC. Began implementing the novation agreement processed by the Defense Contract Management Agency (DCMA) as the cognizant Federal Agency, whic h concluded that restructuring was in the best interest of the government. Performance and Management Performance and Management - 42 Monitored Leidos' operations on legacy Lockheed Martin systems. The Accounting System, Estimating System, Material Management and Accounting System, Purchasing System, and Property System were approved by DCMA in a letter dated August 25, 2016. Monitored the transfer of business systems from Lockheed Martin to Leidos. Subsequently, the Leidos DCMA Divisional Administrative Contracting Officer reviewed and approved Leidos' business sy stems. b) Management of inventory. Conducted two detailed root cause analyses in response to early FY 2017 failures, followed by process improvements. NSF directed the ASC to develop reports on the damaged science equipment and mishandled science samples exp laining how and why the damage occurred, and implement corrective actions to avoid such damage in the future. NSF then approved the action plans and monitored contractor activity for effectiveness. Modified contract policy so that going forward senior ASC management will be directly involved in all high value -science sample shipments to ensure minimum risk. Final approval for shipment must come from the senior transportation manager. Ensured that appropriate mitigation for the risk of loss or damage was imp lemented by November 2016. Directed NSF's annual assessment of ASC performance, which will identify cargo failures and contractor responses. Emphasis will be placed on opportunity costs of mishandled science samples and replacement costs of damaged invento ry. Penalties will be considered in the contractor award fee. Continued to monitor cargo shipments during the August 2017 - February 2018 cycle. Conducted weekly NSF -led meetings with the prime contractor focused on protecting government property. c) Health and safety of research and contractors. Code of Conduct : Developed a process for reporting and reviewing Code of Conduct violations, which states that each year the OPP will send a request to all USAP employing organizations and NSF's on- site repre sentatives (for grantees) for a report of all significant instances of on -ice misconduct for the previous 12 months. This audit action item (#1) regarding the USAP Code of Conduct was formally closed by the OIG on March 28, 2017. Continued to implement NSF process for reporting and reviewing Code of Conduct violations. Updated Code of Conduct to clarify to the community the consequences (e.g., potential removal) of misconduct in Antarctica. Law Enforcement : Oversaw NSF's law enforcement program's achievement of full compliance with all U.S. Marshals Service requirements for certification and training, and recommendations for law enforcement tools made by the Service. Initiated planning for a future site visit to Antarctica, resources and schedules permitti ng. OPP had internal conversations with OGC and reached out to law enforcement organization contacts. Reviewed the final report dated March 12, 2018, of a group of law enforcement officials who had conducted an on- site evaluation in February 2018. The Law Enforcement review and site visit assessed equipment and training for special deputies and reviewed other areas, such as legal jurisdiction, USAP law enforcement staffing, facilities, communications with the U.S. FY 2021 Budget Request to Congress Performance and Management - 43 Marshals Service, and detainment and transp ortation of suspects. The report contains recommendations and suggestions. This audit action item (#3) regarding USAP Law Enforcement was formally closed by the OIG on June 12, 2018. Breathalyzer Testing : Procured breathalyzer units that do not require ca libration. These units provide redundancy for the existing breathalyzer inventory. This audit action sub- item (#4.2) regarding breathalyzer calibration was formally closed by the OIG on December 22, 2015. Continued to explore the advisability and feasibil ity of the OIG -recommended requirement for breathalyzer testing for all USAP participants. Finalized a memo detailing the results of NSF exploration of the advisability and feasibility of implementing a requirement for breathalyzer testing for all USAP pa rticipants. NSF determined that since USAP supporting organizations have their own breathalyzer testing programs, the benefit of establishing and enforcing an NSF -managed breathalyzer program would not be worth the legal, contractual and financial obligati ons. NSF decided to accept the risk of not implementing its own breathalyzer program. This audit action sub -item (#4.1) regarding the legality of requiring breathalyzer testing for all USAP participants was formally closed by the OIG on 02/05/2018. d) Modernization of facilities in the Antarctic Infrastructure Modernization for Science (AIMS) Project .

Performance and Management Performance and Management - 46 Encouraging the Ethical Conduct of Research Lead: Chief Operating Officer Summary of OIG Identified Challenge a) Respond to broader definition of the Responsible Conduct of Research (RCR) which includes protecting the integrity of data; complying with relevant requirements; communicating openly with researchers, institutions, and funding agencies; mentoring; ensuring responsible authorship; managing conflicts of interests; and establishing research environments free of harassment. b) Respond to encouragement to provide substantive guidance t o the research community on mentoring and RCR training to accomplish the goals of the America COMPETES Act. c) Foster the implementation of effective RCR training \u2014including its content and how it is delivered\u2014 for all researchers, especially new members of the research community. NSF Management's Overview of the Challenge and Action Plan to Address and Monitor the Challenge The Responsible and Ethical Conduct of Research (RECR) is critical for excellence, as well as public trust, in science and engineering. NS F expressly defines this issue to be inclusive of both the responsible conduct and ethical conduct of research, recognizing a broad conceptualization of this topic. NSF does not tolerate research misconduct (RM) in proposing or performing research funded by NSF, in reviewing research proposals submitted to NSF, or in reporting research results funded by NSF. Allegations of RM are taken seriously and are investigated by NSF's OIG. The OIG refers completed investigations of RM to NSF for action. Upon determination of RM, NSF takes appropriate action against individuals or organizations. Beyond NSF's RM role, NSF works to foster and maintain ethical research environments in which RECR is not only taught but practiced. RECR includes rigor and integrity, honest and objective peer review, protection of proprietary information and intellectual property, and treating students and colleagues with fairness and respect. NSF leadership commits to RECR through increased programmatic investments, specifically the reposi tioned cross -directorate grants program, Ethical and Responsible Research, previously titled Cultivating Cultures for Ethical STEM; dedicated professional staff and senior executives in the Office of the Director and in the Research Directorates focused on ethics, research integrity, accountability, and research protection; and the oversight and stewardship of the revitalized Online Ethics Center at the National Academy of Engineering. NSF's Corrective Measures to Address the Challenge Demonstrated Progres s Through Agency Action Taken in Prior Fiscal Years Issued Important Notice No. 140, Training in Responsible Conduct of Research - A Reminder of the NSF Requirement, from the NSF Director on August 17, 2017. Published revisions to Proposal and Award Policies and Procedures Guide (PAPPG) to point to promising practices in RECR training, including the encouragement of faculty training.

In November 2019, NSF provided GAO with supporting documentation. Closure of the recommendation is pending GAO review. GAO-12-791 Organizational Transformation: Enterprise Architecture Value Needs to Be Measured and Reported (09/26/2012)Recommendation 45: To enhance federal agencies' ability to realize enterprise architecture benefits, the Secretaries of the Departments of Agriculture, the Air Force, the Army, Commerce, Defense, Education, Energy, Homeland Security, the Interior, Labor, the Navy, State, Transportation, the Treasury, and Veterans Affairs; the Attorney General; the Administrators of the Environmental Protection Agency, General Services Administration, National Aeronautics and Space Administration, and Small Business Administration; the Commissioners of the Nuclear Regulatory Commission and Social Security Administration; and the Directors of the National Science Foundation and the Office of Personnel Management should periodically measure and report enterprise architecture outcomes and benefits to top agency officials (i.e., executives with authority to commit resources or make changes to the program) and to OMB.Open The NSF has implemented this recommendation. In November 2019, the Foundation provided evidence to GAO that it periodically measures and reports Enterprise Architecture outcomes to top agency officials. Closure of the recommendation is pending GAO review.GAO Open Recommendations over 1 Year as of February 2020 Performance - 56 OTHER INFORMATION Management Reviews Each quarter, NSF senior leadership reviews progress towards all performance goals of the agency in a data-driven review meeting led by the Chief Operating Officer and Performance Improvement Officer. The quarterly progress of the Agency Priority Goals (AP Gs) and performance goals are reviewed. Alignment of Human Capital Efforts with Organizational Performance In order to drive individual and organizational performance, NSF requires that the performance plans of all employees, executives, and the general workforce contain individual goals aligned with the agency's mission and strategic goals. NSF provides training and makes tools and templates available for all supervisors and employees on linking performance plans to agency mission, as well as providing assistance and training on the policies, processes, requirements, and timeframes for the development of performance plans and appraisals. NSF also directly aligns its strategic human capital and accountability efforts to the agency goals identified in the NSF Strategic Plan. Agency performance goals currently outline specific human capital goals, and NSF uses HRStat as the agency reporting mechanism to articulate the nexus between NSF's strategic goals/objectives, including agency performance goals, and hu man capital initiatives at the agency. Senior leaders are briefed quarterly regarding the status of agency performance goals and the human capital initiatives aligned to those goals. Strategies and Collaborations No one standard strategy is used across NSF for achievement of goals. Goal leaders at NSF choose strategies tailored to their stakeholders' needs and their institutional capabilities. NSF goals often involve testing the impacts of new activities or new approaches to existing activities, so feedb ack mechanisms are built in. Use of analysis, evidence, and evaluation findings is also at the discretion of each individual goal leader, as is the decision to collaborate with other agencies or external entities or to invest in contract support for their activities. Performance at NSF is reviewed quarterly by NSF's Performance Improvement Officer, who reports on goal progress to NSF senior management. Advisory Committees and Committees of Visitors Each directorate and office has an external advisory committee that typically meets twice a year to review and provide advice on program management, discuss current issues, and review and provide advice on the impact of policies, programs, and activities i n the disciplines and fields encompassed by the directorate or office. In addition to directorate and office advisory committees, NSF is also advised by external committees on specific topics. Recent examples include : astronomy and astrophysics; environmen tal research and education; equal opportunities in science and engineering; direction, development, and enhancements of innovations; polar programs; advanced cyberinfrastructure; international and integrative activities; the agency's merit review processes; and business and operations. Committees of Visitors (COVs) are subcommittees of NSF directorate advisory committees. COV reviews provide NSF with external expert judgments in two areas: (1) assessments of the quality and integrity of program operations and program -level technical and managerial matters pertaining to proposal decisions; and (2) comments on how the outputs and outcomes generated by awardees have contributed to the attainment of NSF's mission and strategic outcome goals. COV reviews are con ducted at regular intervals of approximately four years for programs and offices that recommend or award grants, cooperative FY 202 1 Budget Request to Congress Performance and Management - 57 agreements, and/or contracts and whose main focus is the conduct or support of NSF research and education in science and engineerin g. Approximately one -fourth of NSF's divisions are assessed each year. A COV typically consists of up to 20 external experts, selected to ensure independence, programmatic coverage, and geographic balance. COV members come from academia, industry, governm ent, and the public sector. They meet for two or three days to review and assess program priorities, program management, and award accomplishments or outcomes. Each COV prepares a report and the division or program that is being reviewed must prepare a res ponse to the COV recommendations. These reports and responses are submitted to the parent advisory committee and to the Director of NSF. All reports and responses are public and posted on NSF's website. 1 In FY 2019, six directorates convened ten COVs, co vering all or part of ten divisions . A table of the COVs performed in recent years and planned through FY 202 1 is provided on the next page. The chapters of the directorates also contain information on these COVs, as well as information on ad hoc reports . Evaluations and Research Evaluations at NSF are currently performed at the discretion of the individual directorate, of fice, or program being evaluated. A list of major external evaluations completed in FY 2019 follows. For more details about how the results of these specific evaluations are being used to shape agency decisions, see the chapter of the sponsoring directorat e. Directorate chapters also contain a list of selected high -impact events (workshops, symposia, or other meetings resulting in publications) that inform their decision- making. For more information about program evaluation and collection and management of NSF programmatic data, see the Office of Integrative Activities chapter's section on NSF's Evaluation and Assessment Capability.

The guidance from GAO indicates that agencies should \"...describe the means the agency will use to verify its performance data...\" and \"...provide confidence that [their] performance information will be credible.\"2 In FY 2019, NSF contracted with Nexight Group to perform the independent verification and validation. Nexight assessed the validity of NSF data and verif ied the reliability of the methods used to collect, process, maintain, and report that data. Nexight's FY 2019 report concluded: The Nexight Team was able to verify the reliability of the processes used to generate the performance measure results for eight performance goals. Although some of the measures have issues that should be addressed in future years, the data collection proce sses for all measures adhere to the five V&V criteria\u2014Complete, Consistent, Accurate, Timely, and Valid \u2014and are sufficient to ensure that the results are usable. The Nexight Team was also able to confirm the results reported for twelve of the fourteen perf ormance measures. Due to lack of access to primary data, the Nexight Team was only able to partially confirm the results for the remaining two measures. Overall, the Nexight Team verifies that NSF relies on sound data collection practices, internal controls, and manual checks of system queries to ensure accurate performance reporting. Based on the V&V assessment, the Nexight Team has confidence in the systems, policies, and procedures used by NSF to calculate results for its performance measures. NSF conti nues to take concerted steps to improve the quality of its systems and data. The Nexight Team confirms NSF's commitment to ensuring the accuracy of its reported Government Performance and Results Act (GPRA) results, and the reliability of its processes for collecting, processing, maintaining, and reporting data for its performance goals. 3 The data and information required to measure progress towards NSF's performance goals fall into three broad categories. 1. NSF automated administrative systems . Performan ce monitoring can be a valuable secondary function of such systems. Reporting can include data from systems that: Store and approve publications such as solicitations announcements, and Dear Colleague Letters; Collect transactional data about proposal and award management; Perform financial transactions; Store human resources data; or Permit keyword search of abstract or full texts of proposals and awards. The data were used either directly or for achieving milestones that involve the writing of a report. While not all goals require a high level of accuracy, data from these systems are highly reliable. 2. Data requests of external parties. Qualitative or quantitative information is solicited directly from awardees. 2 GAO, The Results Act: An Evaluator's Guide to Assessing Agency Annual Performance Plans, GAO/GGD-10.1.20 (Washington, D.C.: April 1998), pp. 40-41. 3 Nexight Group with Energetics Incorporated, National Science Foundation Performance Measurement Verification and Validation Report, Fiscal Year 2019 .

These amounts include the obligation of prior year appropriations and other adjustments, and are therefore different from the FY 2019 Enacted Level. The sources of the variation are: Trans fer of funds across appropriation accounts. Obligations (of carryover) from prior year appropriations . Recoveries and other adjustments. Unobligated funds carried over to the next year. Most activities in the R&RA and EHR accounts have two -year funding, s o the carry over and the recoveries are associated with the FY 201 8 appropriation. Funding for Polar Programs, Robert Noyce Teacher Scholarship Program , and Major Research Equipment and Facilities Construction activities have no-year funding, so additional obligations in FY 2019 could also be associated with earlier years.
