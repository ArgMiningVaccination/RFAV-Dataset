What effect does light have on our body, soul and mind? Which substances, medicines and therapies are effective in this context? A number of physiological effects The Class Conference ( Darkness - Co - lour - Light. Light on the Michael School's Meditative Path to Knowledge ) prepared the ground with lectures and conversations; it included a free rendering on the mantras of the tenth and seventeenth class lessons by Matthias Girke, contributions on Darkness, Colour, Light on the Threshold to the Spiritual World by Seija Zimmermann, on Light in the Human Encounter by Michaela Gl\u00f6ckler and a contemplation by Georg Soldner on light and opacity in connection with the General Anthroposophical Society's Foun - dation Stone Meditation. The joint consid - eration of the Michael School's meditative path focused on the spiritual experience of darkness, the silence of the senses and the awakening of the higher self in macrocosm and microcosm. The Annual Conference illuminated the existential relationship between light and health. Light has, for instance, a surprising number of physiological effects; it maintains a healthy warmth balance, serves as an im - portant trigger in our rhythmical system and is connected with the circadian rhythms such as the rhythm of waking and sleeping: our soul life and our thinking are affected by our experience of light.The sun as the cosmic heart Matthias Girke spoke of the physiological effect of light, about how light affects our life and mood, and of the spiritual essence of light. He explained the importance of the light hormones melatonin and vitamin D, and enlarged upon the polarity of serotonin, which is an important factor today in the treatment of depression. continued on page 2 school of spiritual science Light-filled celebration under the countenance of Michael October 2018 N\u00b0 10 School of Spiritual Science 1 Medical Section: Class Conference and Annual Conference Living Light 7 Youth Section: Becoming Human 8 Section for Agriculture: conference Evolving Agriculture and Food 9 General Anthroposophical Section, Youth Section: Class conference 10 Natural Science Section: Exhibition ( Experience Colour ) and new publication ( What is Colour? ) 10 Conference Evolving Science Anthroposophical Society 3 Letter from the Executive Council at the Goetheanum (5) 6 General Anthroposophical Society: How can the global Society be included? 6 Communication: May we contact you by email (4) 12 Annual Motif for 2018/2019: Community-building in the spirit 15 Obituary: Gabriele Christine Gomille-D\u00f6mling 15 Membership News Goetheanum 4 Leadership: autumn retreat 5 Stage: Goetheanum Eurythmy Ensemble Anthroposophy Worldwide 11 Turkey: Waldorf teacher training in Istanbul 11 Latvia: Riga course on Paul Schatz 12 Kenia: All Africa Anthroposophic Training Forum 14 Communication: special edition on conspiracy theories 14 Letter to the article on Shanti Leprosy Aid 14 Constitution initiative Feature 16 Rudolf Steiner's Mystery Dramas: Performing, experiencing and exploring destiny communityMedical Section: Living Light Class Conference and Annual Conference Light as a foundation for life The Annual Conference of the Medical Section, held at the Goetheanum from 12 to 16 September, was entitled Living Light and attracted more than 800 people from all over the world. Our relationship to the sun as the source of light, life and health, as well as medical and therapeutic aspects of light were the central topics at this conference.2 | Anthroposophy Worldwide No. 10/18 continues from page 1 The contemplation of the physiological effects of light - including the polarity of epiphysis and hypophysis often mentioned by Rudolf Steiner - was followed by medi - tative exercises for the generation of light in soul and spirit. In a meditation Rudolf Steiner gave to Ita Wegman's mother ( When I look into the Sun ), the connection of light and life with the centre of the heart as the organ of the rhythmical system lights up, creating a bridge to the sun as the heart of the macrocosm. This meditation was the motto of this light conference and informed its mood and atmosphere. Short-sightedness Georg Soldner focused on the therapeutic importance of light and gave examples of what can happen when patients lose their connection with the sun. The strength of our bones and muscles as well as the function - ing of our immune system depend on light and the effect of this process cannot sim - ply be replaced by using vitamin D tablets. The entire human organism relies on the absorption of sun light. \u00abYoung children learn to see the world as lit up and warmed by the sun. Even the growth of the child's eye is regulated by the sun light among other things,\u00bb Georg Soldner said. In Asia, school children often study till late at night with artificial light and this has an effect on their health. \u00abYoungsters in South Korea spend on average 5.4 hours every day look - ing at a monitor. Many students there are short-sighted because they have not been able to absorb sufficient sunlight.\u00bb Short-sightedness is not a harmless side- effect of civilization. Up to a third of short- sighted adults develop serious eye disorders in the second half of their life. An impor - tant way of preventing short-sightedness is spending sufficient time during the day exposed to sun light, particularly for chil - dren and adolescents. \u00abTeachers are ad - vised to widen the horizon of short-sighted children by guiding them towards a deeper connection with nature so that their soul life can engage more intensely with the life forces,\u00bb Georg Soldner pointed out. \u00abThe eurythmy therapy for eyes developed by the anthroposophic ophthalmologist Ilse Knauer is an effective form of therapy.\u00bb Georg Soldner also illustrated the sub - tle connection between the sunlight, the spheres around the earth and the layers of the skin, a circumstance that enables us to receive the light and at the same time protect ourselves from its potentially harm - ful effects. Protective outer sphere Christoph Schempp spoke of Rudolf Stein - er's lecture of 31 March 1920 ( ga 312). In this lecture Steiner explained the etheric impor - tance of the earth's atmosphere, a fact now corroborated by modern natural scientific findings; this concerns in particular the life-bearing, protective effect of the outer sphere of the earth and the light-generating and filtering effect of the stratosphere. In addition, Schempp presented a compre - hensive picture of the human skin and its manifold sensory activities. Christian Schopper described how people with depression experience a lack of inner light, of light ether, and how therapeutic the arts can be in this context. Marion De - bus showed the path Rudolf Steiner took in order to penetrate to a deeper understand - ing of light at the threshold between the sensory to the supersensible world. The healing aspect of inner light Andreas Zucker presented a case study of a patient using painting therapy and the Peruvian physician Yvan Villegas touch - ingly described the journey of a patient with advanced renal carcinoma towards an experience of inner light. The new Goetheanum Eurythmy Ensem - ble was an artistic highlight (page 5) and its performance was followed by a cheerful party on the terrace under a clear starry sky. The contributions by Rolf Heine on caring for patients with dementia and by Stefano Gasperi on the Gospel of St John (I am the light of the world) concluded the confer - ence. | Heike Sommer, Goetheanum school of spiritual science Anthroposophy Worldwide appears ten times a year, is distributed by the national Anthroposoph - ical Societies, and appears as a supplement to the weekly Das Goetheanum Publisher General Anthroposophical Society, represented by Justus Wittich Editors Sebastian J\u00fcngel (responsible for this edition ), Michael Kranawetvogl ( responsible the M. respon - sible agency - work Anthroposophy ( nna ).

Anthroposophy Worldwide No. 10/18 | 3 Dear members of the Anthroposophical Society, With this further letter at the beginning of the new working year, we would like to address you directly as the Executive Coun - cil, and extend a warm greeting from the Goetheanum to all the members worldwide. What are we building on?' is our motif for this year within the context of our work with the Foundation Stone of the Anthro - posophical Society, laid by Rudolf Steiner in the hearts of human beings. We are cur - rently intensively pursuing the question of an inner ethos and its expression in the current conditions of life within the Society. Questions of leadership In July 2018, after clarifying and reorganis - ing the situation at the Goetheanum, we consciously decided that the four members of the Executive Council would accept the challenge posed by the vote of the mem - bers at the agm in March. We will only deal with questions of a possible addition after the next Annual General Meeting and an evaluation of the experiences made. Many questions concerning the leadership of the Goetheanum and World Society are regu - larly discussed and supported by the larger committee of the Goetheanum Leadership. Speakers (chair persons) of the Goetheanum Leadership for the coming working year are Constanza Kaliks (for the Executive Council) and Stefan Hasler (for the Section Leaders). You recently received a summer letter from us, detailing the financial situation of the Goetheanum (Anthroposophy World - wide 9/2018). It made the current situation clear. In this regard we are truly dependent on your participation and active support for the work of the Arts and the School of Spiritual Science in the spirit intended by Rudolf Steiner. We are grateful for the first positive support and donations which have reached the Goetheanum from members and friends. We very much hope that this common stream can sustain the continued activities at the Goetheanum in the coming year without demanding major cuts. Interest in individual forms of being and life During the many travels of the Council members in the last months, in each case by invitation, the great diversity with which an awareness of the spirituality living in the world as a burning question, was tangible. It was particularly evident in the encounters with members, branches and institutions. The overall impression remains that this mul - tiplicity of difference has a unifying effect. On the basis of these experiences we, as the Executive Council, strive to develop an attitude in the Anthroposophical Society that not only tolerates these different forms of work and approaches to Anthroposophy, but also affirms in them the living reality of spiritual life. Only then can we be \"an enquiring society of what is universally hu - man\" and contribute to the essential ques - tions of current civilization. What is needed is the will to take an interest in these indi - vidual forms of being and life, to recognize them in their diversity and thus to develop an ethos of care for a humane life of soul. Nurturing a personal contact to mem - bers, branches, groups in the professional fields, Country Representatives, General Secretaries and Functionaries is a central task of the Executive Council, in order to meet the concerns described. In some places this has already been intensively developed, in others we look forward to taking it up anew. Involving members in decision-making At the recent retreat of the Executive Coun - cil and at the meeting of European General Secretaries and Country Representatives in Warsaw ( pl), we discussed, among other things, the question of how members could be more involved in the decision-making processes of the worldwide Society. The desire and necessity to take a step in this direction is timely and significant. Justus Wittich and Gerald H\u00e4fner report on the various possibilities which also touch on constitutional issues and which need to be discussed and considered together in Anthroposophy Worldwide (page 6). Dear members, we greatly appreci - ate your support, your interest and your participation in what is happening at the Goetheanum: a School of Spiritual Science, the home of Anthroposophy and the Arts, as well as a place for international encoun - ters. | With kind regards from the Executive Council at the Goetheanum: Justus Wittich, Joan Sleigh, Constanza Kaliks and Matthias Girke (English by Joan Sleigh) Going out into the world - the world coming to the Goetheanum: conversations on the Goetheanum Terrace (archive picture)Executive Council at the Goetheanum Letter from the Executive Council antroposophical society4 | Anthroposophy Worldwide No. 10/18 The Foundation Stone Meditation - in connection with the annual theme - will form one of the focal themes of the com - ing working year. As an introduction to this theme, we studied the relationship be - tween the first foundation stone laying of 1913, the physical foundation stone and the Foundation Stone Meditation, which Rudolf Steiner, in 1923, placed as a word meditation into the hearts of the members present. Concentrating on the middle verse (\u00abHu - man Soul! You live within the beat of heart and lung\u00ab), we shared, over the following days, our thoughts on how the Foundation Stone Meditation lives in the individual Sec - tions and in the Anthroposophical Society. It was impressive to see how differently it is experienced in the work of the Sections. We will continue with this approach in our morning study, which takes place every Tuesday throughout the year, so that the annual theme will also become a reality within the Sections.Goetheanum Leadership activities and future plans A colourful picture arose from the presen - tations given by each of us on the sum - mer events and journeys we had experi - enced as part of our responsibilities: at the Goetheanum we had the Conference of the Romance languages with 380 participants, followed directly by a student conference which attracted around 200 people. Con - stanza Kaliks, among others, was in charge of both events; in August Constanza then travelled to Australia for seminars. After the fourth year eurythmy gradu - ations, which are held annually at the Goetheanum under the auspices of Stefan Hasler, an event entitled Mystery Dramas across the World took place at the end of July. This conference of almost all lay en - sembles involved in staging Rudolf Stein - er's Mystery Dramas was attended by 370 people. Stefan Hasler and Christiane Haid among others were in charge. A meeting of the initiative group Medita - tion Worldwide took place in The Hague (nl) in mid-July and was attended by Chris - tiane Haid. At the end of July Gerald H\u00e4fner contrib - uted to the Soul of Europe conference in Georgia and he also lectured at the sum - mer conference of the Anthroposophical Society in Great Britain. Joan Sleigh was involved in the earlier annual School of Spiritual Science conference in London ( gb). Also in Great Britain, in Stourbridge, an exhibition on colour theory opened, orga - nized by co-workers of the Natural Science Section in cooperation with Johannes K\u00fchl. Jean-Michel Florin travelled to Togo for the first time to give an introduction into biodynamic farming. Ueli Hurter vis - ited biodynamic initiatives in the Baltic countries and he gave a seminar on fed - eralism in Finland. Florian Osswald attended a teachers' conference in Peru with 500 participants and went on from there to an upper school teachers' conference in Buenos Aires ( ar). Claus-Peter R\u00f6h offered a seminar on the middle school in Hungary on behalf of the Education Section. Georg Soldner represented the Medical Section at the International Postgraduate Medical Trainings ( ipmt ) with more than 250 students in China, Russia and the Czech Republic. Matthias Girke contributed to a conference on palliative medicine and pain therapy organized by the umbrella organization for Anthroposophic Medicine in the United States, aamta . From there he travelled to the ipmt in the Czech Republic, then to the Summer Academy at Witten- Herdecke University ( de), which had 250 participants, and finally to the conference of the Swedish medical association at the Vidar Clinic in J\u00e4rna ( se). A reflection of skills and the need for learning As part of the ongoing development of our work as a leadership body we had a ses - sion on one of the afternoons, in which we reflected to each other our skills and our need to learn. This was felt to be a very fruitful and community-building moment which we will continue to foster. As a way of providing better insight into our work we will compile a written annual report on the activities of the Sections and of the Executive Council for the 2019 Annual goetheanum Goetheanum Leadership: autumn retreat Community-building Returning from different countries across the globe, the Goetheanum Leadership (the four Executive Council members and eleven heads of Sections) met for their autumn retreat from 3 to 5 September. It was an intensive, honest and refreshing work meet - ing, each unit starting with a study of the Foundation Stone Meditation. Anthroposophy Worldwide No. 10/18 | 5 Stage: Goetheanum Eurythmy Ensemble Work has started The new Goetheanum Eurythmy Ensem - ble has taken up its work in September. A mere six days after starting rehearsals the ensemble members presented their first performance. The Goetheanum's faculty for eurythmy now consists of a team of six directors, who come from Switzerland, Great Britain and South Africa. They and seven further eu - rythmists constitute the new Goetheanum Eurythmy Ensemble. The ensemble will prepare one main programme per year (first premiere on 29 December 2018); there will also be programmes dovetailed to events at the Goetheanum. In addition, there will be productions to be shown in kindergar - tens, schools, social institutions and nurs - ing homes. Major projects such as Rudolf Steiner's Mystery Dramas and Goethe's Faust are also among the tasks of the Goetheanum Eurythmy Ensemble. The members of the new Eurythmy En - chaninova. Eurythmists from the area around the Goetheanum will be recruited for individual projects. A new production of Goethe's Faust, directed by Andrea Pfaehler (drama) and Eduardo Torres (eurythmy), is planned for 2020. | Sebastian J\u00fcngelGeneral Meeting. In 2018/2019 we will hold a series of lectures at the Goetheanum which will illustrate the research that is being done by Section and Executive Council members. We also looked ahead and shared our views on the forthcoming events and initia - tives from 2019 to 2024 - an activity that will also be continued. We discussed three larger conference projects that are (or were) new to the Goetheanum: The worldwide specialist conference on biodynamic re - search on 6 to 8 September, organized by the Section for Agriculture, the Transhu - manism Conference from 7 to 9 September, presented by the Humanities Section, and the World Goetheanum Association Forum from 28 to 30 September. Developments within the School of Spiritual Science Two questions we also discussed had to do with the development of the School of Spiritual Science: how does the medita - tive deepening, which needs a protected, quiet space, relate to the practical work within the Sections. How can these two approaches be understood as a whole in the sense of the School of Spiritual Science? This is meant to illuminate the question of representation and the conditions of an esoteric life, their relationship with each other and with regard to the conditions and forms of working. Other issues which need working on and which are arising from the publication of the nineteen Class Lessons were identified. They will be presented and consulted on in November at the confer - ence of class holders and contact partners. The development of the General Anthro - posophical Section and ways to find a new leadership were further points of discussion. Justus Wittich, Ren\u00e9 Becker and Florian Os - swald have been assigned the task to form a search group. We hope to bring this process to a conclusion within the next nine months. The development of the Anthroposophical Society With regard to the Anthroposophical So - ciety we spoke about future images, its role as a global society and its perspectives. The societies in the various countries have developed in very different ways. While the Anthroposophical Society in the German- speaking world has existed for more than a hundred years, other countries are still in a pioneering phase. The fact that most people encounter anthroposophy today through the spheres of life means that the Society needs a new and different structure. In this context we also discussed the ques - tion whether particular working contexts can be seen as specialized work groups so that they can see themselves as part of the Society. This will happen now in the case of the professional group of alternative health practitioners ( Heilpraktiker ). Another important matter was the con - cern submitted at the 2018 Annual General Meeting by members from Norway and the rest of the world: to clarify how members from all countries can in future be included in the agm 's decision-making processes. We discussed this and are considering ways that could be developed to serve this purpose. Gerald H\u00e4fner and Justus Wittich will com - pose a letter with a corresponding proposal. We then went on to consult on the specialization of the Executive Council's work in relation to that of the Goethea - num Leadership. This consultation will continue. We decided that the Executive Council will write a letter to members this September. The Executive Council will also organize the 2019 agm . The Goetheanum in Development We discussed the present status of the projects that are part of the Goetheanum in Development initiative. As a result of the changes within the Executive Council some new projects need to be reconsidered and newly allocated. Some projects have reached an advanced stage, others need changing. We will provide more informa - tion on this in this publication at a later time. The question of communication is par - ticularly urgent for us because the monthly newsletter Anthroposophy Worldwide can no longer be sent out by post ten times a year in Germany. In addition, we are work - ing on ways of enhancing communication with the members and on possibilities for the (German) weekly journal to reflect more strongly the activities of the Sec - tions and the School of Spiritual Science. We have also been looking into the finan - cial situation and the new responsibilities at the Goetheanum. We are looking forward to taking on, together with you, the important tasks of anthroposophy in the world. | Christiane Haid, Constanza The new Goetheanum Ensemble 6 | Anthroposophy Worldwide No. 10/18 General Anthroposophical Society How can the global Society be included in decisions? At this year's agm an urgent concern was submitted by the Nordic Societies, asking how members or groups that are too far away from the Goetheanum can be includ - ed more in the decision-making processes of the General Anthroposophical Society. In preliminary conversations and over the following weeks various possibilities have been considered. Finding a suitable solution for a world-wide Anthroposophi - cal Society has proved difficult so far. The outcome one hopes for is individual par - ticipation but there is a real danger that the Society is growing into something like a club. We would therefore like to encour - age an early exchange on this question and invite proposals. Models: delegation or direct ballot One conceivable option is a bicameral sys - tem where, aside from the general meet - ing, the presently 35 representatives of the various countries consult on amendments to statutes, membership fees and the ap - pointment or confirmation of the Executive Council, and bring about a majority decision from the point of view of this chamber of countries. If the General Meeting should then vote differently, there would be an intermediary consultation phase and a new vote would need to be cast on the next day or in a subsequent assembly. The General Meeting would have the final decision. This process could be introduced quickly since this body already exists. Reservations were expressed from within the group of General Secretaries, however, concerning the question how they, as representatives, would deal with issues that were discussed controversially in their own countries. One could also consider an extended chamber where - as in a delegates' sys - tem - a group of around 500 members sends one representative (around eighty delegates in all). Although, with such a bicameral system, more regions and countries across the world could vote, individual members living at a greater distance from the Goetheanum could still not participate directly. If we de - cide to go this way as a Society, we would have to look into the possibility of voting by letter: each member, wherever they are in the world, could download or copy a ballot paper, and dispatch it in a sealed envelope with a covering letter that bears the membership number and signature to the General Meeting. In this case it would be important that each member receives the same written or other information. A consultation and debate during the AGM, additional information or even spontane - ous changes or amendments would in this case not be possible. Language barriers could cause additional problems. An anthroposophical approach could con - sist in preliminary or parallel meetings in the various countries and languages, where members vote by letter but all the votes are only counted later, at the same time. This would allow for debate and exchange with other members, but a drawn-out voting period and the possibility of varying levels of information could be problematic. Appeal for active contributions Another option, which is technically pos - sible but may not be suitable at present for an Anthroposophical Society, is the live-streaming of the agm on the internet with the subsequent possibility to cast a vote. Apart from the fact that, if the vote is taken at the Goetheanum at 12 noon it will be 10 p.m. in New Zealand and 3 or 7 a.m. respectively in the USA and Brazil, the technical requirements for a secret ballot would be immense and the equipment very expensive. Again, it would be essential for conditions to be equal for all members. There are also forms in between the ones mentioned, for instance the possibility of transferring up to five votes to another member (extensive control measures re - quired) - but none of these possibilities are really satisfactory. Maybe we need to develop entirely dif - ferent and new procedures for the twenty- first century and for the Anthroposophical Society? We are looking forward to hearing your ideas on the topic. | Justus Wittich and Gerald H\u00e4fner, Goetheanum Communication with members May we contact you by email? (4) Since we asked for your email address, around a thousand members have been in touch. Thank you for this! Anyone who has received the fourth Letter to Members by email does not need to contact us. Anyone else who has an email address we would ask to consider letting us have it, best by filling in the form at www.dasgoetheanum. com/email . Thank you also to all those who wrote to inform us that they have no email ad - dress but would like to continue to receive Anthroposophy Worldwide. If this applies to you but you have not written yet, please write now to Anthroposophy Worldwide, \u00abemail\u00bb, Postfach, 4143 Dornach, Switzer - land. We are looking for ways of making sure that no one is excluded from receiving Anthroposophy Worldwide, including for financial reasons. In Anthroposophy Worldwide 9/2018 we informed you that the regular journals of the Anthroposophical Society in Germany, via which Anthroposophy Worldwide has so far been distributed in Germany, will in future only be sent out four times a year. The idea at the moment is that An - throposophy Worldwide will continue to be published ten times per year. Various committees are working on developing the concept. | Justus Wittich (as publisher), Sebastian J\u00fcngel (as editor) antroposophical society Wanted: a form of participation from afar ? Anthroposophy Worldwide No. 10/18 | 7 The idea for the conference theme came up at the international Youth Section meeting in The Hague ( nl) in July 2017, where we collected questions that are relevant to us young people. We noticed that these ques - tions always related to humanity and to the future of the earth. We found it important to create a connection between the human being, human development and the pos - sibility of creating a better future. Balance between form and freedom Many hours of strenuous skyping lay ahead: struggling to find a title, the programme, work groups and lectures ... . We were think - ing in particular about the balance between form and freedom. It was essential for us that the young people could become ac - tive and start joint activities. We did not envisage a conference where people come, have lectures and workshops presented to them and then leave again. Ninety per cent of work groups were given by young people because we wanted to promote this great potential. Two days before the conference started the organization team finally met face to face at the Goetheanum: eleven young people, one from Argentina, one from Aus - tralia, three from Brazil, two from Germany, two from Israel (2), and one each from the Netherlands and Switzerland. Over the next two days we did all we could so that this conference could take place - after all the preparations that had been done in Dorn - ach. When the conference finally started, we felt an enormous sense of relief. Our vision had become reality, even if each one of us had had to make compromises. After the first meeting of the 170 con - ference members from 31 countries, Con - stanza Kaliks gave an introduction that was mostly about the question of human rights and about who is responsible for them. The fact that a right is established by law does not guarantee that it is being observed - we see this in many places in the world. Each of us was responsible for this right becoming a reality, Constanza said. In the eurythmy performance of the young Novalis Ensemble we experienced the struggle between light and dark in a deep and moving way. Roused from sleepiness We - like everyone else - began the next morning with singing and movement. Kefas from Sweden roused us from our sleepiness with rhythms, songs and singing meditation. Two members from the organization team were always responsible for one day and announced the intentions for each day in the morning. The three main days were entitled I, We and the World. Joan Mel\u00e9 gave a fiery lecture, in which he presented an outline of Rudolf Steiner's biography, of the foundations of anthropos - ophy, social threefolding, today's banking system and the responsibility we have. He managed to speak about all this in one hour, describing even the deepest essence in a way that we could all understand. We were particularly impressed when he pointed out to us what happens with the money we have in the bank and that we should ask what our money is supporting. We must take responsibility for what we buy and where we deposit our money. In the Open Space we heard about ini - tiatives of the conference members and witnessed spontaneously formed smaller work groups and meetings. In the Faust performance, presented in the Georgian language, a young group demonstrated to us how they experience Faust and how they had brought him into the twenty-first century. Their performance felt very authentic. The strength to implement ideas On the We day we had, instead of a lecture, a panel discussion with Constanza Kaliks and Nicanor Perlas and in the evening an open mic session. For two hours the participants took turns taking to the stage in the Sch - reinerei and giving us a taste of their talent. Nicanor Perlas was in charge of the World day and spoke to us about Artifi - cial Intelligence ( ai). What we knew from Science Fiction movies had long become reality, he said. The next stage of evolution is not meant to be about human beings but machines being in charge. Nicanor Perlas is speaking up all over the world so that this will not happen, that the machines will not control but serve us, so that we can develop our humanity. His new book ( Humanity's Last Stand ) addresses this problem. On the last day Constanza gave us new hope again and encouraged us to fight for peace and freedom, every day. Dignity and freedom I have rarely experienced such a confer - ence. We could feel the pulse of the young people's life, their will for the future; the power to make ideas become reality. I have not often felt so much potential concen - trated in one room. Something has changed dramatically in recent years: youth conferences are always a wonderful experience, but the situation the world is in now evokes new forces in young people. Aside from the joy of the encounter I could sense the will to take action - not only as an intention but as a real possibility. I hope that we will stand up together for a future determined by human dignity and freedom. | Milena Kowarik, Dornach ( ch) school of spiritual science Youth Section: conference Becoming Human Willing to take action Becoming Human. Questions for Co-creating the Future was the title of a summer youth conference at the Goetheanum from 14 to 18 July 2018. The confer - ence was prepared by youth sections across the world. This was a challenge, not least because of the time difference between Australia, India, Israel, Central Europe, the United States and Brazil. World day: Nicanor Perlas on humanity in the age of ai8 | Anthroposophy Worldwide No. 10/18 Sebastian J\u00fcngel What kind of resonance has this research conference left for you? Jean-Michel Florin My impression is that the wide-spread biodynamic scene - farm - ers as well as scientists - have moved more closely together. The mood during the con - ference was one of gratitude, even euphoria and hope. We had researchers there who are close to bd farming but also people for whom this was the first conference on the topic. Verena Wahl People came to this con - ference from 26 countries and all conti - nents - for the first time German was no longer the main language. J\u00fcngel What led to this mood? Florin About two thirds of the people present had prepared their own contribu - tion - which means that a more than aver - age number were involved in shaping the conference. Wahl The way the conference was struc - tured also played a part. Before the con - ference started there were guided tours of the Goetheanum, and the conference provided space for people to get to know and share their thoughts with one another. The work groups (Experience the Living) also made it possible to approach the con - ference themes in ways people were not used to from other scientific conferences: through feeling and activity. And we had a festive conference dinner. Research and practice working together J\u00fcngel Which topics touched people most? Wahl Researchers working together with a farmer, for instance. Mechthild Kn\u00f6sel from Rengoldshausen Farm ( de) questioned the necessity for separating calves from their mother. She was looking for possibili - ties to raise calves close to their mothers, particularly considering that the calves got sick quite often. As a result of her coopera - tion with two researchers, Anet Spengler Neff from the research institute for organic farming fibl, ch) and Silvia Ivemeyer from Kassel University ( de), a set of guidelines and practical advice have been published (these can be bought from shop.fibl.org/ chde/1660-mother-bondedcalf-rearing. html). Florin It is so fruitful and forward-looking when - as intended by the Section for Ag - riculture - researchers and farmers work together and scientists don't just get data from farms. One looks at genuine questions and solves them together. Concrete results are achieved that benefit the animals. Wahl Conventional farmers also like to make use of the results of this cooperation. Florin I was touched to hear that the re - search conducted by Daniel Kusche (Kassel University, de) has revealed that milk from biodynamic animal farming is tolerated bet - ter and that it even enhances infant immuni - ty (i.e. fewer allergies). And I was impressed by the presentation by Karuppan Perumal from a bd training in India. He demonstrat - ed how more carbon dioxide is bound in the soil with BD farming methods than with others. It was also interesting to hear that a field study carried out by Marie Auger from Spirit of the Earth Farm, Hawaii ( us) seems to indicate that ddt -contaminated soil is decontaminated more quickly with biody - namic than with main stream methods - I had heard of similar results in a project in France. We need to continue to work on this. Relevant for agriculture in general J\u00fcngel What image of biodynamic re - search did this conference generate? Wahl Working conditions are different across the world for research scientists. Try - ing to get bd farming research accepted at a university in Latvia is difficult. This was evident when someone from India asked whether Latvian studies took the seed cal - endar into account. This is not possible in Latvia. Scientists appear again and again in a country, like beacons, but they are often left alone with their work and were there - fore delighted to meet like-minded people. Florin We must not forget that connect - ing research and practical application was an intrinsic part of the biodynamic ap -proach right from the start. A trial group for biodynamic research was founded very early on. Ehrenfried Pfeiffer conducted re - search in the basement of the Glass House, the building that is now the home of the Section for Agriculture. Some people see Rudolf Steiner's Agriculture Course as a col - lection of answers, while it is in fact mostly posing questions. J\u00fcrgen Hess, professor for ecological farming and horticulture at Kassel University, summarized this when he said, \u00abYou have twelve important treasures that you have been working on. That is rel - evant for agriculture in general.\u00bb This is new. J\u00fcngel Why is this? Florin: The food situation is desperate and the climate change makes farmers worry about their farms. The thought of in - dividualism in farming, which is expressed in the \u00abclosed agricultural course\u00bb, helps here. Today, we call this resilience. Wahl There is another reason which has to do with animal welfare. For a long time this was not seen as particularly important. But due to the vegan movement - which is not necessarily organic - animal welfare has become an issue. The need to apply the theory in practice J\u00fcngel What were the key topics? Florin Soil fertility, for instance, and food quality. There was also a need for holistic research methods. The effects of biody - namic farming are not captured by analyti - cal methods alone. We need analytics as well as spiritual science. Without analytics and statistics we won't be up-to-standard scientifically. But we need a whole range of methods over and above that. As well school of spiritual science Section for Agriculture: Evolving Agriculture and Food We need analytics as well as spiritual science The first international research conference on biodynamic farming took place at the Goetheanum from 5 to 8 September. Over 180 farmers and scientists met in order to share their views on the most recent research results and projects in the field of bio- dynamic farming. In conversation with Jaspal Chattha Singh Anthroposophy Worldwide No. 10/18 | 9 The impulse for this conference arose at the international Youth Section meeting in The Hague ( nl) in the summer of 2017, when a small group formed of people who wished to get to know the Class Lessons and the School of Spiritual Science. The idea was also inspired by an initiative by J\u00f6rgen Smit, who used to study the Class Lessons with young people. We - Roi Schmelzer, Johannes Kronenberg, Janna and Milena Kowarik - had the wish to work on the nine - teen Class Lessons together. Access via the soul forces Because we are a group with members from Israel, the Netherlands and Switzer - land, our only way of working together on the Class Lessons or on organizational questions is via monthly Skype sessions. We asked ourselves which motifs had led us to this initiative and what we wanted to achieve with our conference. What does it mean to be part of a spiritual society in the twenty-first century? How can we connect with each other in a way that allows the Michael impulse to become effective? What does the world need? What do we need? With the help of Constanza Kaliks we be - gan to study the three soul forces as a way of approaching and gaining a deeper under - standing of the Class Lessons. This work was also part of our three-day gathering in April. We presented our work, our insights and questions, which meant that we were not only involved in organizing the gathering but instrumental in shaping it. This lent the meeting a special note, because we were able to speak out of our process and discuss our questions within the group. From the beginning we were able to have deep and personal conversations about the contents of the Class Lessons, and there was a strong will to become active repre - sentatives of the School of Spiritual Science and of the world. We felt that the School had forged a deep and strong connection between us although we did not always share the same views. The three Class Lessons were held by Rik ten Cate, Constanza Kaliks and Ron Dunsel - man. Milou Dunselman helped us to work artistically through our experiences. Studying all nineteen Class Lessons During these days a seed was created that now wants to grow into the future. We have the will to work through all nineteen Class Lessons and study relevant topics in such annual conferences by 2024. A meeting has been scheduled for the coming year, too, and we have already begun with the nec - essary preparations. We felt strongly that such meetings would strengthen the small group of young Class members and there - fore also the future of the School of Spiri - tual Science. | Milena Kowarik, Dornach ( ch) school of spiritual science school of spiritual science General Anthroposophical Section/ Youth Section Being part of a spiritual society Thirty young members of the School of Spiritual Science came together at the Goetheanum from 6 to 8 April to study the contents of the first three Class Les- sons. The young people came from Brazil, Canada, Germany, Israel, Romania, Swit - zerland and the United States. Actively representing the Michael impulse: Jo- hannes Kronenberg and Roi Schmelzer speak Mit - teilungen (Swiss anthroposophical news- letter), 7-8/2018as evidence-based research which shows whether or not something is effective we need development research. We need to develop ways of applying the theory in practice. J\u00fcngel Where does the Section for Agri - culture stand after this conference? Florin We have become a broader move - ment, internationally as well as in scientific terms. In November 2017, at the Organic World Congress in Delhi ( in), the biodynam - ic movement became part of the worldwide ecological movement. At the annual confer - ence on preparations, which was held at the Goetheanum in February 2018, different approaches were represented on an equal footing. And now we were able to have a research conference. Growing contact with the world Wahl The Section demonstrated its abil - ity to make things happen, such as bringing representatives of different approaches to - gether. While this is not research in the clas - sical sense, it does respond to a real need, as we can see from the response we had from the organic movement and from rep - resentatives of the academic sciences. \u00abYou are brave!\u00bb one colleague told me, because there are normally no experience reports in scientific conferences. For us that means: We do not necessarily have to do research ourselves - activating the biodynamic network in itself has an effect. And our openness did not come across as arbitrary. Florin And this was due not least to the precise scientific studies. The interface between the world and the Section for Agriculture has grown bigger. We want to continue doing our own research, as we did with the study on biodynamic preparations. Wahl The biodynamic movement has become more visible and has shown that it is part of the scientific world. Florin People who attended the research conference have acknowledged our right to make biodynamic research visible. We would like to extend our cooperation with other partners. This is encouraging recog - nition, the appreciation of a realistic goal. J\u00fcngel What will happen next? Florin A wider group of biodynamic re - searchers will meet, at the latest, in Sep - tember 2020 in France, at a conference organized by the Section for Agriculture that will precede the major ifoam Organic World Congress.10 | Anthroposophy Worldwide No. 10/18 Natural Science Section Experiencing colour An exhibition entitled Experience Colour opened in Stourbridge (gb) on 28 August. Be- fore the opening, a book came out by Michael H. Wilson which asks \u00abWhat is Colour?\u00bb Experience Colour has been developed from an exhibition at the Goetheanum in 2010 which marked the 200th anniversary of Goethe's Theory of Colour and has travelled to other places since then. It was conceived and set up at the Goetheanum's Natural Science Sec - tion by Matthias Rang, Nora L\u00f6be, Jasminka Bogdanovic and Johannes Onneken. The interest of friends in Great Britain and sup - port from Ruskin Mill Trust have made it possible to present the exhibition now at Glasshouse Col - lege in Stourbridge ( gb). This is remarkable and important given that the history of the theory of colour has always been informed by the ques - tion Goethe or Newton? Our exhibition, on the other hand, looks at Goethe's research as an extension of the work begun by Newton. The old brick buildings from the era of Eng - lish industrial glass-making, with their gen - erous spaces, and the newer or older experi - ments presented, provide amazing insights into the world of light and colours. This is a hands-on exhibition, where visitors can change the conditions and explore what happens. Before the opening of this exhibition, Mi - chael H. Wilson's book What is Colour? The Collected Works was presented. Wilson was one of the pioneers of anthroposophy in Britain, a professional musician, special needs teacher and specialist on colour. His scientific work was also known outside anthroposophical circles. In the 1960s his name was even mentioned fa - vourably in an article written by Max Born, who was awarded the Nobel Prize for physics in 1954. The two editors of Wilson's book - Laura Liska from the Natural Science Section in Dornach (ch) and Troy Vine from Humboldt University in Berlin ( de) - employed much diligence and care in collecting and studying the various works which were spread out across the world. | Johannes K\u00fchl, Goetheanum school of spiritual science The conference Evolving Science 2018 is, in a sense, a continuation from the Evolving Science conference that took place as an international gathering for the first time in 2015. The title then was The Future of Goetheanism . This year's conference will explore ways to the spirit in nature. We chose this topic because the interest in the connection between anthroposophical meditation and nature is clearly growing and because it is a question that is of in - terest to a wide variety of disciplines. We intend to work on this issue in three ways: 1. By studying the spiritual aspect of the world in the idea: what is concealed in the sensory world is thought of as a spiritual correlate. This part relates to the \u00abSpirit Recalling\u00bb in Rudolf Steiner's Foundation Stone Meditation. 2. In observing nature we can practise a kind of inner development that Rudolf Steiner referred to as \u00absymbolizing\u00bb ( ga 322). This relates to the \u00abSpirit Awareness\u00bb in the Foundation Stone Meditation. 3. Rudolf Steiner speaks repeatedly of the darkening of the sensory world at the threshold to the spiritual world. What is the significance of the sensory world at this threshold? This is connected with the \u00abSpirit Beholding\u00bb of the Foundation Stone Meditation. In order to include the nights into the conference process each lecture will be discussed on the following morning. There will also be research presentations, artistic nature observation and work groups. Future directions One of the work groups will focus on the more fundamental question as to the future of the Natural Science Section. According to Johannes K\u00fchl, most of those active within the Section today are \u00abover 50 and male - it would be good if this could change.\u00bb The professional environment of the Section, he pointed out, was not as wide as that of the teachers, for instance, who feel a connection with the Education Section. Johannes K\u00fchl sees three future direc - tions for the Section: Working on new effects. In Rudolf Stein - er's time this approach was represented by Lili Kolisko, for instance; today it appears in the crystallization method used in quality testing, in drop crystallization and other picture-forming methods. Goetheanism in the sense of \u00abreading in the book of nature\u00bb. This is more about seeing developments in nature as they re - ally are rather than about new experiments. This approach has been primarily developed in the field of education. Human development and the develop - ment of the human cognitive capacity on the basis of nature. This is a field in which Jochen Bockem\u00fchl, among others, has achieved much. More recently, various other ideas for working on have emerged. This work is, of course, also relevant in practice, in quality assessment for instance. Projects The exhibition Experience Colour is being shown in Stourbridge ( gb; see article on the left). There is also a joint project with the Medical Section on \u00abNeurophysiology and Freedom of Will\u00bb and plans are afoot to cooperate with Ursula Wolf (Bern Univer - sity, ch) on the therapeutic effect of light. Johannes Wirz' research into beekeeping and that of Torsten Arncken, in coopera - tion with Weleda, on medicinal plants are ongoing, as is the work Matthias Rang and Johannes K\u00fchl are doing on quantum phys - ics. The Section's publication Elemente der Naturwissenschaft (elements of natural science) will soon go online. The idea is for this to eventually be transformed into an international publication, in other words to publish it in English, too. | Sebastian J\u00fcngelNatural Science Section Ways to the spirit in nature From 3 to 7 October natural scientists will come together for the second time in order to report on their research. This conference, which is part of a series entitled Evolving Science, will take place at the Goetheanum. One of the work groups will be about the future of the Natural Science Section.

Anthroposophy Worldwide No. 10/18 | 11 Latvia: course on Paul Schatz in Riga Inversion On 25 and 26 August Matthias Mochner (de) spoke in Riga about Paul Schatz's Discovery of Inversion and his technical developments. We looked at the oloid from various points of view and studied the phenomenon of in - version. Both lectures were complemented with practical exercises that were fun to do and made us feel awake. Matthias Mochner had brought models along that enabled us to experience what inversion is. Both the forms and the rhythmical-pulsating movement of the inversion were totally new to us. We felt like the people around Paul Schatz must have felt in the 1930s, when he first demonstrated inversion: it was like a miracle; like a blossom that opens and makes you believe in miracles. We constructed an inversible cube our - selves and an oloid (from cardboard); we sculpted a pentagon dodecahedron from clay and experienced \u00abgeometrical eu - rythmy\u00bb. We also heard about Paul Schatz' biography: his initiation experience as a wood sculptor, his remarkable relationship with his father, Samuel Schatz, but also his inner future-oriented relationship to Judaism, and much more. Bridge between I and cosmos Our gathering was held at the Waldorf kin - dergarten, which was founded 25 years ago by Ligita Gulbewas (Rgas Prdaugavas pirm - skola), with German to Latvian interpreta - tion. At the beginning and end we heard the famous poem which Paul Schatz wrote in 1963: \u00abIn freeing the cube from itself, / and joining it to the cosmic spheres, / I en - abled its return to itself. / Since then a dialogue resounds / between cosmic beings and those of gravity. / And all I say and do / has been derived from this dialogue.\u00bb With joy, warmth and gratitude we have worked on building the bridge from the I to the cosmos that is symbolized by the in - version of the cube. | Julija Jansone, Riga ( lv) anthroposophy worldwide Joy and warm interest, even excitement and curiosity were tangible when a new teacher training course ( esdd ) began in Istanbul. This mood prevailed throughout the two weeks as the budding Waldorf educators and teachers were enthused and moved to find their own language in speech and tone eurythmy. Anthroposophy and phenomenology Moving in unity with the cosmos is some - thing deeply rooted in the Turkish soul. Through the mystic Rumi (1207-1273), the dancing dervishes have left impulses that one can easily relate to through eurythmy. The Anatolian dances continue to live in the consciousness of these warm-hearted peo - ple for whom dancing is more than just a pro - fane activity: it always has a divine aspect. We used the poems of N\u00e2zm Hikmet Ran as well as works by Rudolf Steiner, Johann Wolfgang Goethe, Johann Sebastian Bach, Ludwig van Beethoven, Arvo P\u00e5rt and Rob - ert Schumann, and performed them attired in eurythmy dresses and veils. Before the choir and the eurythmy, the circa sixty students had been taught about phenomenology by Monika W\u00fcrzinger ( de) and about Rudolf Steiner's image of the human being by Alfred Rahmen ( ch). New worlds opened up before the eyes and ears of the students who came from all over Turkey and Cyprus. The lecturers spoke in German with professional simultaneous interpretation. Verve and inner fire Conducted by \u00c1gnes Kov\u00e1cs (Budapest, hu) and accompanied on the piano by Tamami Kawase (Tokyo, jp ) we rehearsed pieces from the oratory N\u00e2zm Hikmet by the modern Turkish composer Fazl Say. The audience was deeply moved by the songs about the Girl from Hiroshima. This was followed by fiery, ensouled and rhythmical Anatolian songs accompanied by original instruments. The audience joined in be - cause it was no longer possible for them to sit quietly on their chairs. After the two performances the students stood opposite the lecturers and the au - dience, filled with deep gratitude. Some - thing had been achieved and seeds had grown from the anthroposophical work that pointed towards a positive future for this country, towards a unity of east and west. | Roberto Luca Pellacini, Hamburg ( de), Tarhan Onur, stanbul ( tr)Turkey: Istanbul Waldorf teacher training Uniting east and west Another training course for educators and teachers (esdd ) took place in Istan - bul from 23 July to 5 August, the main themes being the anthroposophical image of the human being and phenom - enology. The course ended with a euryth - my performance and a choral concert. Moving with the cosmos: students of the teacher training course in Istanbul Paul Schatz: Technik und am Goetheanum, 2016.

Verlag Niggli, 2013.] 12 | Anthroposophy Worldwide No. 10/18 The illustration shows the fifth rhythm as Rudolf Steiner wrote it on the blackboard. This rhythm has two parts: it contains the three exercises - the verb practise does not at first appear on the blackboard, but I assume that Rudolf Steiner has spoken it - as well as the last lines of the medi - tation's fourth verse. The three exercises appear along the periphery of the circle (at the top), while we find the second part of the rhythm inside the circle. Inner world - outer world What about this lower part of the circle? Rudolf Steiner did not complete this lower part on the blackboard. Instead he wrote the word \u00abwill\u00bb. It is as if the circle consti - tuted a separation of an inner world from an outer world and as if the three exercises, in conjunction with the verb \u00abwill\u00bb, form an active link between inside and outside. What is inside us can have an effect on our environment if we consider the words that are written around the circle: the act of willing and the three exercises. When we carry out the three exercises, our actions will be more fitting to the situ - ation we are in. By practising we bring to - gether in our consciousness what is inside and outside; through our will activity our inner life radiates out into the reality of life. Starting from the feeling Most of the other rhythms in the Foun - dation Stone Meditation have a threefold structure. This is, at first, different in the fifth rhythm, due to the last lines of the Meditation's fourth verse. If we look at them more closely, though, the words that appear there also have a threefold struc - ture: \u00abfound from our hearts\u00bb, \u00abguide from anthroposophy worldwide antroposophical society The mornings began with an invigorating session of eurythmy led by Cobie Roelvert (sa). Thereafter, we were tasked with ob - serving the four elements of earth, water, air and fire in our individual capacity, from three aspects: our knowledge, our observa - tions and then how the elements related to our humanity. The morning was rounded off by working through the Seven Conditions of Esoteric Training. I personally found exploring and understanding these seven conditions a strenuous, but rewarding process. Theory, eurythmy, farming Daily, the eurythmy reflected the themes in an inspirational way. We experienced the solid earth, the fluid water, the rushing air and the flaming fire in movement. We prac - ticed threefold walking and felt ourselves as noble pillars of light. We experienced the vowels and saw these gestures in nature. I found them all represented in a banana tree! In the afternoon the themes were as fol - lows: The Child by Andrea Seemann ( de), Ethical Business by David Wertheim-Aymes (SA), Biodynamic Farming and Gardening by Angela Hofmann ( eg) and Practical Work by Anne and Rolf Bucher ( de), Anthroposophic Medicine by Friedemann Schad ( de), Care for Mother and Baby by Carola Edelmann and Ulf Beckmann ( de), Eurythmy Therapy by Julia O'Leary ( sa) Prayer and Medita - tion by Richard Goodall ( sa). The practical work was done on the farm at the Mbagathi Waldorf School. Angela was a shining example of transforming desert sands in fertile lands. Our group highlight was making Cow Pat Pit and the eventful journey on poor roads, passing the many roadside vendors. Social competence Michaela Gl\u00f6ckler stated that the social problems need educational solutions and that educational problems need thera - peutic solutions. An antisocial drive in our thinking is the desire to convince the other that our opinion is right, whereas being socially competent is learning to come into conversation and help the other to become a better thinker. She pointed out that a seeker of the truth will sacrifice his opinion in the quest for the truth. Being socially competent is question - ing ourselves before we act, knowing that when we do what is needed, we respect the freedom of others and make them happy! To be socially competent is learning to look from the others', and not one's individual perspective. Transforming the earth I loved meeting my brothers and sisters from Africa and have returned to South Africa knowing that each delegate will carry his/her light and lighting up' our African continent. My personal aha moment was that we human beings are masters or ex - pert handlers of warmth, and therefore we are the transformers on the earth and have immense power. Do we harness this power or abuse it? Even more significant, are we conscious of our power? | Rowena Bell ( sa)Kenya: All Africa Anthroposophic Training Master of Warmth From 1 to 8 August the training Human Development and Social Competence for the whole of Africa took place in Nairobi. Almost 70 participants came together at the Franciscan Family Centre and dealt with anthroposophical topics. The vari- ous professional groups were invited to work together across professions. Working together on the farmThe Anthroposophical Society's Annual Motif for 2018/2019 Community- building in the spirit The fifth rhythm of Rudolf Steiner's Foundation Stone Meditation brings together the practising of the first three verses with the soul forces ad- dressed in the fourth verse. One aspect of this concerns the path from thinking to will through the centre (feeling), an - other one concerns the effective we. Website thewidermovement.org.za Anthroposophy Worldwide No. 10/18 | 13 our heads\u00bb, \u00abwith purposeful will\u00bb. The centre appears first (the heart or feeling), followed by the head (thinking) and then the will. The process therefore starts in the soul. For our future actions, our future humanity, we start at the centre and only then we proceed via the head (thinking) to the will, becoming conscious of ourselves in this process. This is what this rhythm teaches us. Looking at the wording of the fourth verse we realize that we are asking (or praying to) the Christ Sun to warm our hearts and enlighten our heads, but we are not asking for our will to be strength - ened. The will activity is left to us. All three areas - heart, head, will - are activated by the three exercises at the beginning of this rhythm. The Christ being, which can sup - port our actions, is not mentioned here; it is the active practice of the three exercises that will give the impulse for our actions. We carry out these exercises. The fourth verse as a whole conveys to us the experience that we cannot really move on as human beings without the warming and enlightening effect of the Christ Sun. In the fifth rhythm we ourselves try to move forward with the help of the three exercises. What does Rudolf Steiner say of the three exercises in the fifth rhythm: \u00ab[They] will open our hearts to the being that has tru - ly appeared at the turning of time and in whose spirit we wish to work now and in future.\u00bb ( ga 260, lecture of 30 December 1923). He then goes on to speak, as a fur - ther introduction to the rhythm, the fourth verse of the Foundation Stone Meditation. When we carry out the three exercises, the Christ Sun can take effect in us. With the help of the three exercises we can \u00abrise\u00bb to a sphere where the Christ can help us pursue our true will intentions. Understanding the We How can one, in this rhythm, find the transi - tion from the three exercises to the words of the fourth verse? Or more precisely: how do we give content to the word We? When you speak this rhythm to yourself, medita - tively, it can either feel like I speak it myself or like it is spoken to me, I am hearing it. We can consciously make ourselves feel the one or the other. If we do this as we speak the fifth rhythm, the words \u00abwhat we would found from our hearts\u00bb can become a special experience. If you speak yourself, the question arises as to who is included in this we that I am pro - nouncing? Who is meant by it? And what do I do with this in practical life once I have found an answer? If the rhythm is spoken to me, on the other hand, the we in the line \u00abwhat we would found from our hearts\u00bb is speaking to me. There already is a we. This we does not need to be restricted to earthly human beings; it can include other beings, too. I sense that the beings included in this we are active. They form an active community. The question arising for me is whether I belong to this we, to this community, or whether am I on my way to belonging to this we? Can I apply for this? Now, the three exercises seem to be an invita - tion and, at the same time, a condition for joining in. Because of the content of the fifth rhythm, there is a third possibility for how it is spoken: you are speaking it together with other beings, as a we. If we allocate content to the we in this conscious man - ner - and there are various ways of doing this - the practising of this rhythm can become a kind of community-building in the spirit. And however you go about it, you are actively involved in building this community - and you are entirely free. The community that arises from the fifth rhythm does not diminish my individuality but relies on it. The fifth rhythm is in my view a suitable basis for study and meditation if we are looking for an answer to the question as to how the social impulse of the Christmas Conference of 1923-24 can be understood and how we can connect with this impulse. It seems to me that the Christmas Confer - ence comes to expression in this rhythm as an impulse for our Society. | Auke van der Meij, Foundation Stone Initiative Group antroposophical society \u00abThat good may become ...\u00bb (Rudolf Steiner, ga 260) The following contributions to the An - throposophical Society's annual motif for 2018/2019 have been published so far: On the first rhythm: Rhythm and Move- ment by Christiane Haid, Anthroposophy Worldwide 5/2018, p. 12f.

As someone, who like thousands of others, seeks an open and cosmopolitan anthroposophy, I bow to such initiatives; I am grateful to such people and hope that they will not be drowned out by the noisy discussions, particularly also with a view to the encourag - ing and future-oriented initia - tive of the World Goetheanum Association and World Goetheanum Forum. | Thomas St\u00f6ckli, Dornach ( ch)Initiative for a supraregional study and discussion group on the constitution of the Anthroposophical Society Change, not end: the world in turmoil; Donald Trump, the president of the United States, disregards agreements and conventions and is changing the post-war order. Europe is reeling and, according to An - gela Merkel ( de), has to assert itself and stand on its own feet. End as well as change, downfalls and hopeful new beginnings; sickness and healing, death, harrowing of hell - and resurrections, both on the smaller and larger scale, parallel and simultaneously! Of similar quality the 2018 agm at the Goetheanum: the long overdue and complete rehabilitation of Ita Wegman and Elisabeth Vreede (after 83 years!) and at the same time the surprising non-con - firmation of Paul Mackay and Bodo von Plato as members of the Executive Council of the General Anthroposophical Society. The statutes define a community In this turbulent situation, some members of the anthro - posophical movement and So - ciety who have been active for many years have decided to start, as a members' initiative, a study and discussion group on the constitution of the An - throposophical Society. Why? There is no denying that soci - eties, associations or countries are defined by their constitu - tion (or statutes). Content and form certainly are interacting. Finding the right form for the anthroposophical move - ment and Society was impor - tant to Rudolf Steiner. He also knew that a new form needed to be \u00abfound again after a few years\u00bb and that there are no lasting solutions when it comes to the social life. Impor - tant decisions can no longer be imposed top-down be - cause that leads to frustration, fatigue, sickness or rebellion, division and fragmentation. What we need today is an ef - fective, meaningful inversion of procedures! Openness, transparency, integration We envisage our study and discussion group as a forum where the general constitu - tion of the (General) An - throposophical Society and movement can be discussed in a relaxed but focused at - mosphere; a place where the most diverse contents and structural as well as personal aspects can be shared; a space of openness, transparency and integration, where everyone can speak their mind without fear. (To start with) we must be able to tolerate different views (humbly). It will be important to recognize the individual pearls and, ideally, make them into a beautiful string of pearls. We are aim - ing for a participatory, vibrant society of members. After a first gathering in Munich from 21 to 23 Sep - tember, a second meeting is planned for 26 to 28 October at Rudolf Steiner Haus in Berlin (de). A third meeting is sched - uled for September or around the turn of the year. | Jochen Baltzer, Munich ( de), and Ulrich H\u00f6lder, Stuttgart ( mees Worldwide No. 10/18 | 15 27 December 1925 - 8 May 2018 Gabriele Christine Gomille-D\u00f6mling Gabriele D\u00f6mling practised as an anthroposophic physician for many years, in and around Hei - delberg ( de). People have point - ed out how deeply she under - stood each individual patient's medical as well as biographical situation and how ingenious and generous her therapies of - ten were, always starting from observing the whole person. Gabriele D\u00f6mling was born in Ulm ( de) on 27 December 1925. She had one sister, with whom she remained close. Their par - ents were students of anthro - posophy. At the age of around 18, Gabriele started reading anthro - posophical books although her father thought this too early; a family friend recommended that he should allow it and this was the beginning of a lifelong connection with anthroposophy. With this inner orientation she studied medicine and became an assistant physician at the Ita Wegman Klinik in Arlesheim (de). Later she had her own practice until she retired when she was far into her seventies. Supporting anthroposophical initiatives With this inner orientation she studied medicine and became an assistant doctor at the Ita Wegman Klinik in Arlesheim ( ch). Later she worked in her own medical practice until she retired when she was well over seventy. With Herbert Gomille she lived in a partnership, and later mar - riage, which they both used in order to support anthroposoph - ic initiatives and institutions, financially as well as actively. A strong character, Gabriele D\u00f6mling knew what she wanted and could come across as dif -ficult or inflexible, but she was someone who moved things and who helped many people. Culture was essential to her (she knew Goethe's Faust by heart) and poetry her lifeblood, which she knew to share generously and in the right dosage. Deeply connected with the impulse of pastoral medicine After retiring the couple relo - cated to Arlesheim. When her husband died, Gabriele's soul did not seem to remain wholly in this world. The Christian Community priest who visited her witnessed her deep connection, even in these final years, with the im - pulse of pastoral medicine and anthroposophy when she joined him in speaking the familiar words from Rudolf Steiner's Pastoral-Medical Course ( ga 318). | Dorothee Jacobi, Basel ( ch) Antroposophical Society We have been informed that the following 48 members have crossed the threshold of death.

Drama groups were from Bern ( ch), St Pe tersburg Japan (a combina - tion of various groups), New York ( us), Vi - enna ( at), Rome ( it), the Netherlands, ( il) and the Goetheanum ( ch). It was an educated audience familiar with the dramas. Some in the audience had devoted many years to the dramas. Stefan Hasler termed it a Conference of Relationships. Stefan said, \u00abAs Shake - speare gave us the question of individual destiny, Rudolf Steiner gives us the question of group karma.\u00bb Indeed there were many opportunities to meet each other and to ponder group karma. The soul forces in Goethe's Tale of the Green Snake and the Beautiful Lily The first artistic demonstration showed the relationship between characters from Goethe's Tale of the Green Snake and the Beautiful Lily and The Portal of Initiation . It is such a help in understanding the character of Maria by reflecting on the state of the Lily, who turns all she loves to stone. Her three servants with their props (or qualities) of stool, harp, and parasol of pearls relate splen - didly to the three soul forces: Philia of the sentient soul, Astrid of the intellectual/feel - ing soul, and Luna of the consciousness soul. Especially revealing was the relationship between the green snake and the Fourth Panel of The Foundation Stone Meditation . When the snake swallows the gold and is filled with light, she then returns to the hor - izontal position in sacrifice to become the bridge. This amazing portrayal of the snake was then placed side by side with the ritual of the silent introduction in the Fourth Panel. In Goethe's story, the subterranean temple is transformed into a Sun Temple, while such a metamorphosis of temples in The Portal of Initiation indicates a transfor - mation of our relationship to our thinking. Taking responsibility The second play, The Soul's Probation , fo- cuses on trials and challenges of the char - acters. Benedictus reveals the spiritual biography of Maria in a web of destiny with Johannes, Capesius, and herself. Mi - chael Debus developed the theme of the apprenticeship model as the three steps to become truly human. The apprentice has no responsibilities, no opinion. After three years the apprentice may become a jour - neyman, who begins to think for himself, as he learns from other masters. The master craftsman has full responsibility. Each step may be taken in mental development. The curriculum is karma, held by the an - gel. Our first step is to say yes to our des - tiny and meaning. Secondly one must take responsibility for oneself, to pay attention and to work for healing of the world to - gether. And this is the step that Maria takes, as she stands in the place of sacrifice, freely acting out of insight. Only Benedictus is the master, responsible for others and yet, he leaves them all free. This is the third step. It is the task of the human being to make something of the material world, so that the spiritual world can connect with humanity. Parting and meeting again, with a hint of recognition I experienced some of the most profound moments during the drama workshop led by Adrian Locher. By walking and speak - ing certain lines of Maria or Johannes, one met another person and interacted. We were partners, standing back to back until the warmth spread; then to part, to walk away, and to meet again with a hint of recognition...Do I know you? By wres - tling in weight, then fluidity, airy, fiery, the words took on character. After many years of living with the Mystery Drama, now I understood the characters of Maria and Johannes through this experience. Adrian left us with the question: Does anyone ex - perience a knot of destiny in group karma? Imagine focusing on the character of The - odora speaking of her vision, then relating to Thomas the Miner, followed by Strader, all in Swedish, by the J\u00e4rna Mystery Drama Initiative. This was followed by the dramatic staging of the Spirit of the Elements with lightning and thunder by different groups of artists from Japan. Someone remarked later that Ahriman should always be spoken in Japanese! All of the participants should be encouraged to continue producing the dramas. We look forward to the next event. Most meaningful were meetings of like-minded people at the Goetheanum, the House of the Living Word. I end with a quotation attributed to Adam Bittleston: \u00abIn the new mysteries the whole earth becomes an altar. The hidden tragedies and triumphs of the pupils become external fact. Our friends and colleagues become for us, though we and they may know but little of it, the ter - rible and wonderful actors in the ceremony of our initiation.\u00bb | Maria Ver Eecke, Chestnut Ridge, New York ( usa)Rudolf Steiner's Mystery Dramas Performing, Experiencing and Exploring Destiny Community During the conference Rudolf Steiner's Mystery Dramas across the World, held at the Goetheanum from 21 to 25 July 2018, fifteen groups presented scenes from their pro- duction of the dramas.
