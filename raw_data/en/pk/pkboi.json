Similarly, the risk of ICU admission was 45% lower. This means that the risk of hospital and ICU admission was nearly twice as low for people aged 60 and older who received a repeat vaccination in the autumn round. Since early March, a downward trend has been observed in the number of COVID-19 hospital and ICU admissions. Between 8 March and 1 May 2023, hospital admissions were highest in the age group of 80 years and older. People who do not have the same vaccination status may also have differences in vulnerability (underlying health conditions), the number of SARS-CoV-2 infections they have had, and the number of COVID-19 vaccinations they received before the autumn round. A comparison between the relative risk of hospital admission between people with a different vaccination status therefore cannot be exclusively used to indicate vaccine effectiveness for the repeat vaccination in the autumn round. Everyone who has been invited to get a COVID-19 vaccination in the basic series, but has not yet done so, can still be vaccinated. In addition, since 19 September 2022, it is possible to get a [repeat vaccination](https://www.rivm.nl/en/covid-19-vaccination/questions-and-background-information/repeat-vaccination) against COVID-19. This repeat vaccination in the autumn round is available to everyone aged 12 years and older who has at least completed the basic series of COVID-19 vaccinations. The vaccination is available from 3 months after the most recent COVID-19 vaccination or SARS-CoV-2 infection. "}
