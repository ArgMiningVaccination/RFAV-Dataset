If your allergens are outdoors, you can start sneezing and wheezing as soon as you step outside. If they're indoors, you'll need to constantly take measures to try to lower the risk you'll have to deal with mold, mildew, dust mites, and pet dander. Still, allergy symptoms have an annoying way of cropping up anyway. Cue you, frantically Googling, \"home remedies for allergies\" to try to get some form of relief. While allergy medication can and does have a place for helping with allergy symptoms, experts swear that a few small changes to your routine can bring symptom relief, too. \"I think many people feel like making lifestyle changes can be really hard so I love to approach these in a step-wise fashion with patients\u2014no detoxes Ohio State University Wexner Medical Center](https://wexnermedical.osu.edu/). Before you try any allergy relief, solutions, though, it's important to get tested. If you don't know what you're really allergic to, there's really no way to guarantee anything will give you relief. \"With allergies, your body is having an exaggerated response to something that should be harmless so it's really important to know your trigger,\" says [Lakiea Wright, M.D., M.P.H.](https://physiciandirectory.brighamandwomens.org/details/12710/lakiea-wright-allergy_and_immunology-boston), board-certified allergist and associate physician at [Brigham and Women's Hospital](https://www.brighamandwomens.org/). Different [types of skin and blood testing](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK367583/) are available, depending on your symptoms and medical history. \"Getting allergy testing helps you recognize your triggers and learn what specific techniques may be most useful and worthy of your time, energy and money,\" adds Dr. Wada. Allergy home remedies that work Here's what to do once you're armed with info: Avoid pollen It's impossible to control the weather (and you can't stay inside forever!) so it can be especially tricky dealing with a pollen allergy. Dr. Wright suggests limiting your outdoor activity during times of the day when pollen counts tend to be high (typically dawn and dusk) and using a smartphone app to track levels. On top of that, a face mask might help. In fact, 30% of people in [a recent study](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7467086/) said their seasonal allergies improved when they wore a surgical face mask outside, and that number improved to 40% when they wore an N95 mask. When you go indoors, Dr. Wright recommends changing your clothes to remove any pollen that might be stuck to you\u2014and keeping windows closed so pollen doesn't come inside. Try acupuncture \"The literature does suggest\u2014 [based on a small number of studies](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4479426/)\u2014that acupuncture may have a modest benefit for some patients with allergic rhinitis or hay fever symptoms,\" says Dr. Wright. \"There needs to be additional larger studies, but the thought is that acupuncture can help increase blood flow and if you have nasal congestion from your allergen exposures, then promoting blood flow in that area could help to improve your symptoms.\" Essentially, it's a practice that can't hurt and has potential to help, so it's worth a shot if you're struggling. Rinse nasal passages \"Sinus saline rinses such can increase mucous clearance by [about 30%](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3904042/) which can be very helpful at flushing out allergens,\" says Dr. Wada. A [neti pot](https://www.amazon.com/Non-Metallic-Comfortable-Dishwasher-Natural-Congestion/dp/B07SF5ZJQN/) can be a great way to get the job done, and rinsing may also help reduce inflammation and swelling. Just keep in mind that you'll need to use distilled, sterile, or previously boiled water, per the [Food and Drug Administration](https://www.fda.gov/consumers/consumer-updates/rinsing-your-sinuses-neti-pots-safe) (FDA). (Tap water isn't safe to use s a nasal rinse because it can contain bacteria and protozoa that could cause potentially serious infections when they're placed in your nasal passages.) \"I fully support nasal irrigation, but one caveat is if you're using medications like nasal steroids, you want to make sure you rinse before you put in the medication because you don't want to rinse the medication away,\" notes Dr. Wright. Cool down your eyes Similar to nasal irrigation, artificial tears can help wash allergens out of watery, itchy eyes, but Dr. Wright recommends taking things a step further and keeping the bottle in your fridge. \"That way it's a little cool when you put it in your eyes, which helps to calm down those allergy cells that are firing off,\" she explains. If you'd rather not use eye drops, she says a cold compress can also help. Eat a healthful diet If you haven't already, now might be time to switch to a [plant-forward, anti-inflammatory eating style](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3904042/). That's because [research shows](https://www.hsph.harvard.edu/nutritionsource/nutrition-and-immunity/) your immune system needs a variety of micronutrients to perform at its best and things like excess sugar and processed foods can increase inflammation and throw things off kilter. \"Eating a balanced diet and eating the whole rainbow of foods, we know is good for your immune system in general,\" says Dr. Wright. \"We just don't have the evidence specifically for allergies.\" Make adjustments at home If indoor allergies are getting you down, a few tweaks to your home environment can make a huge difference. To start, Dr. Wright recommends placing HEPA filters throughout your house. \"They help filter out some of the allergens like dust mites and pet dander from the air,\" she says. Along those same lines, dehumidifiers can help remove moisture from the air in damp areas like basements and prevent the growth of allergens like mold. You'll probably have to do some extra cleaning, too. \"If you have carpets or rugs, you want to vacuum weekly,\" advises Dr. Wright. \"You also want to wash your bedding weekly in hot water and dry it in high heat because that will kill off dust mites. Another thing my patients don't realize is the mattress can be a harbor for those dust mites so you really want to change out that mattress about every seven years.\" She says encasing your mattress and pillows in allergen-proof covers can also help. Lastly, if you're allergic to your pet, Dr. Wright recommends bathing them weekly to decrease their dander. Drink water Without enough water, the human body struggles to function, and some [animal studies](https://academic.oup.com/endo/article-abstract/136/5/2189/3037088?redirectedFrom=fulltext) suggest that dehydration can lead to an increase in histamines in the body\u2014which there's already an excess of during an allergic reaction. \"Staying hydrated is good in general for your health, but when it comes to allergies, if you are taking antihistamines, those can also dry you out,\" says Dr. Wright. \"So you definitely want to stay on top of your water intake and make sure you stay hydrated.\" Manage stress For some people, yoga is their go-to stress-reliever. For others, it's reading, doing jigsaw puzzles, or talking to a therapist. Find what works for you and, as hard as it may be with everything going on, do your best to carve out time for it. [Studies show](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2819057/) that stress can exacerbate allergic reactions so the more you can minimize what's going on in your body, the better you may be. Shower when you get home Even if you can't see them, pollen and other allergens stick to your body while you're out and about. \"Showering helps rinse off pollen that sticks to our skin and hair during the day,\" Dr. Wada says. \"This gives our body a break from exposure during sleep which is the time our body is in recovery mode.\" Note: It's best to [wash your hair](https://www.prevention.com/beauty/hair/a39994014/how-often-to-wash-hair/), too, given that it's right next to your nose and mouth and can also carry pollen. Wear a mask outside Masking up doesn't just lower your risk of getting COVID-19\u2014it can also help with your allergies. \" [Face masks](https://www.prevention.com/health/g38462007/best-disposable-face-masks/) are very effective against allergens and symptoms were much better for most when mask mandates were in place,\" says Purvi Parikh, M.D., an allergist/immunologist with [Allergy & Asthma Network](http://www.allergyasthmanetwork.org/). Dr. Wada also recommends this hack. \"Wearing a mask can also be helpful to filter out some of the pollen and mold in the air,\" she says. \"I have many patients that find this particularly helpful when they mow the lawn or do other yard work.\" Don't touch your nose and face when you're outside. The global pandemic has made plenty of people aware of just how often they touch their faces. But, even then, people still do it. Unfortunately, touching your face and eyes when you're outside can rub pollen into those areas, upping your risk of allergy symptoms, according to the [American College of Allergy, Asthma, & Immunology](https://acaai.org/allergies/management-treatment/living-with-allergies/gardening-with-allergies/) (ACAAI). Your best bet: Wash your hands before you touch your nose and eyes or, if you can't get near soap and water, use a moist towelette first. Try to stay inside after thunderstorms. Rain and pollen have a tricky relationship. Rain showers can temporarily clear pollen from the air, the ACAAI says. But thunderstorms can actually [increase](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8672486/) pollen counts since lightning, wind, and temperature changes can stir things up. Remove excess moisture from your kitchen. Moisture can provide a breeding ground for mold and mildew in your home. And, if you're allergic to them, you could be in for even more symptoms if you don't do something about it. The [American Academy of Allergy Asthma & Immunology](https://www.aaaai.org/tools-for-the-public/conditions-library/allergies/cleaning-tips-for-allergy-and-asthma-sufferers) (AAAAI) recommends using an exhaust fan on a regular basis to reduce moisture in your kitchen and empty your trash daily. It's also a good idea to store food in sealed containers and get rid of moldy or out-of-date foods ASAP, the AAAAI says. Natural solutions that don't work Not every home remedy you hear about is a home run. These often-touted natural solutions don't have the research to back up their use. - Honey: \"Local honey may be delicious but does not contain enough of the correct types of pollen to have any effect close to that of immunotherapy,\" says Dr. Wada. - Essential oils: \"There's no evidence to suggest that [essential oils](https://www.prevention.com/health/a28943071/best-essential-oils-for-colds/)can be beneficial to improving your allergies,\" says Dr. Wright. In fact, she says the strong scents can actually worsen allergy symptoms in people whose nasal passages are overreactive. - Supplements: \"I don't routinely recommend herbal or homeopathic supplements to treat allergies,\" says Dr. Wada. \"The data doesn't support their use and since they are unregulated it is impossible to know if what is listed on the bottle is actually what is in the bottle.\" When to see an allergist If home remedies don't seem to alleviate your allergy symptoms, there's no reason to continue suffering. Schedule an appointment with an allergist to discuss medical solutions. \"I think it is really helpful to find an allergist that you can partner within your care and letting him/her know your goals of care,\" says Dr. Wada. \"Education and information can be incredibly empowering and meeting with an allergy expert is going to help you understand all the options available to treat your symptoms.\" For instance, immunotherapy in the form of allergy shots, drops, or tablets that contain regimented doses of specific allergens could provide long-lasting relief. \"Over time, the body learns to ignore these triggers rather than fight them,\" explains Dr. Wada. Dr. Parikh agrees. \"Allergen immunotherapy is a great option to decrease and improve your allergies over time,\" she says.
