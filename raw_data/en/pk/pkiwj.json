While it was of critical importance to the global virus-fighting efforts that we kept running our plants and serving our customers, we focused first on protecting our population of DuPont workers. We set a goal in 2021 to ensure the maximum number of employees remained safe from COVID-19. We offered testing at many of our sites, and we hosted events for vaccination to be administered either off-site by local public health agencies of on-site at our facilities where feasible and permitted by local government. China Integrated Health Services (IHS) team worked with local government in Shanghai to arrange the COVID-19 Mobile Vaccination Station at the China Technology Center (CTC) for 2 times. The vaccine bus, providing 3 types of vaccines, was fully staffed with doctors and nurses to support the function. The 2 days vaccine event administered over 240 vaccinations to DuPont employees at China Technology Center and the nearby Kunshan Service Center. Vaccination events at our Circleville, Ohio site made vaccines available to family members of employees; and vaccination events at our Wilmington, Delaware sites made vaccines available to contractors and site tenants as well. Vaccine events like these resulted in the delivery of over 1,900 vaccine doses to over 1,000 Dupont employees globally. We offered self-testing to all employees in our EMEA (Europe, Middle East and Africa) region in Norther Ireland, Luxemburg, Czech Republic, the Netherlands and Germany. At our Luxembourg site alone, over 150 PCR tests and approximated 20,000 antigen tests were administered to employees and contractors from January to October. The Indian government plans to have India's railways routes fully electrified by 2023 and fully powered by renewable sources by 2030. DuPont Kapton\u00ae FCRC wire insulation coupled with DuPont Nomex\u00ae slot liner insulation is the standard for high efficiency traction motor insulation systems for demanding, high temperature rail applications, Photovoltaic panels are expected to convert sunlight into energy for 30 years or more, but solar panels in the field often experience degradation and other failures that shorten their useful life, thereby reducing their ability to produce renewable energy. Tedlar-based backsheets have been demonstrated to significantly extend panel lifespan, with multiple examples of installations generating electricity well beyond 30 years. In August 2021, Hurricane Ida significantly impacted our Pontchartrain, LA manufacturing facility. Preparations for site operations, employee safety and community recovery began days ahead and continued weeks after. Hydrofluorocarbons (HFC) are used in blowing agents and manufacturing of other building insulation materials. Some HFCs have high global warming potential (GWP) where they end up in the atmosphere and contribute to climate change. Creating a water-optimized future relies on innovation and action now, and in future generations. The \"Flow of Life\" project promotes water science literacy and education across primary and secondary students in China. Many rivers around the world are now classified as \"high stress\". This means that more than 40% of the naturally available water in the basin is removed leading to the risk of water scarcity. Our Zhangjiagang site in China set a sustainability goal to reduce wastewater generation, and address other water usage opportunities. DuPont provides solutions that enable vehicle electrification and expansion of the electronic vehicle (EV) market, including thermal management, battery assembly, and enhanced connectivity "}
