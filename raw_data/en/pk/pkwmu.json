With a careful jab in a healthy volunteer's arm, scientists at the Kaiser Permanente Washington Research Institute in Seattle begin an anxiously awaited first-stage study of a potential COVID-19 vaccine developed in record time after the new virus exploded from China and fanned across the globe. [Full coverage of the coronavirus outbreak](https://www.nbcnews.com/health/coronavirus) \"We're team coronavirus now,\" Kaiser Permanente study leader Dr. Lisa Jackson said on the eve of the experiment. \"Everyone wants to do what they can in this emergency.\" March 16, 202001:25 [Trump tells Americans to stay home to 'defeat' coronavirus](https://www.nbcnews.com/video/trump-tells-americans-to-stay-home-to-defeat-coronavirus-80720965646) The Associated Press observed as the study's first participant, an operations manager at a small tech company, received the injection inside an exam room. Three others were next in line for a test that will ultimately give 45 volunteers two doses, a month apart. \"We all feel so helpless. This is an amazing opportunity for me to do something,\" Jennifer Haller, 43, of Seattle, said as she awaited the shot. She's the mother of two teenagers and \"they think it's cool\" that she's taking part in the study. After the injection, she left the exam room with a big smile: \"I'm feeling great.\" Monday's milestone marked just the beginning of a series of studies in people needed to prove whether the shots are safe and could work. Even if the research goes well, a vaccine wouldn't be available for widespread use for 12 to 18 months, said Dr. Anthony Fauci of the U.S. National Institutes of Health. Still, finding a vaccine \"is an urgent public health priority,\" Fauci said in a statement Monday. The new study, \"launched in record speed, is an important first step toward achieving that goal.\" This vaccine candidate, code-named mRNA-1273, was developed by the NIH and Massachusetts-based biotechnology company Moderna Inc. There's no chance participants could get infected from the shots because they don't contain the coronavirus itself. It's not the only potential vaccine in the pipeline. Dozens of research groups around the world are racing to create a vaccine against COVID-19. Another candidate, made by Inovio Pharmaceuticals, is expected to begin its own safety study \u2014 in the U.S., China and South Korea \u2014 next month. The Seattle experiment got underway days after the World Health Organization declared the new virus outbreak a pandemic because of its rapid global spread, infecting more than 169,000 people and killing more than 6,500.
