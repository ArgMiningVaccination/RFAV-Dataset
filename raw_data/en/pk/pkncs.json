A unique feature of Bydka suchi is its use of script combining Chinese characters and Japanese readings in the form of furigana . Furigana are conventionally employed to signal the pronunciation of Chinese characters, but the furigana in Bydka suchi function as a means for giving the author's translation into the everyday native language of medical terms which are traditionally written in Chinese characters, which were of originally foreign for Japanese. This thesis particularly scrutinises the gap between the Chinese medical terms and their furigana glosses, as it shows how Chinese medicine was transmitted and imbibed by a Japanese physician in order to facilitate understanding lay readers who had not made a formal study of medicine. The thesis consists of three main parts: The first part reviews the intellectual background of cultivation of life culture in both China and Japan, with reference to some of the relevant insights by previous studies. The second part explores how the author's view of body and illnesses can be reconstructed from a close examination of furigana in the text. The third part is devoted to the translation of the first fascicle of Bydka suchi, which concisely represents the author's basic views on medicine, body and illnesses. The translation with meta-commentary will enable us to appreciate the effect of the Chinese charsLCters-furigana combinations, as well as to examine the essence of the physiology, pathology and medical ethics of the text. The principal contribution of this research to the field lies in reassessing how the Edo views of body and illnesses deviated from their Chinese counterparts. As a conceptual study, it will also shed light on the uses of special features of Japanese script in transmitting technical concepts into more colloquial and popular language. 3 Table of Contents Acknowledgement 16 / List of Tables /8 List of Illustrations /8 Table of Chinese Dynasties /X O Table of Periods of Japanese History /11 Introduction/12 Scope of thesis/12 Themes and existing studies /17 Structure of thesis /20 Chapter 1: Intellectual Background of Cultivation of Life \u2014 Historiography and Literature Review 122 Introduction /22 Chapter 1-1.

Nonetheless, the realisation of this thesis would not have been possible without the help of many people and organizations. Of all others, I would like to convey my deepest gratitude to Professor Christopher Cullen, who has supervised me from the very earliest stages of this research. Always displaying a sense of humour, he has helped me to shape my ideas. Even when I have vacillated, he has been lenient about the time I have wasted, and he has given me great freedom to pursue self-directed work. \"Without his cheerful encouragement and unstinting help, this thesis could not have been completed. 1 am very grateful to Dr Vivienne Lo and Professor Peter Komicki for their thorough criticism and detailed comments during the viva for this thesis. Dr Lo, always kind and frill of concern, has taught me how to construct my arguments more clearly and effectively. Professor Komicki's close examination has made me realise the importance of being precise and careful in every single detail when writing a thesis. Their remarks indicate what is missing in my thesis, and that will surely further my future research. I was extraordinarily fortunate in having Professor Shigehisa Kuriyama as my supervisor during my research at the International Research Center for Japanese Studies. Not only was he a constant oasis of ideas; he also spent precious time reading various drafts of this thesis and gave constructive comments about them. I am indebted to him more than he knows. I am much deeply obligated to Professor Timothy Barrett for helping me through the complicated procedures of thesis submission. He did it out of pure kindness, for which I am very grateful. I also thank Professor Frank Dikotter and Dr Shabnum Tejani for their sympathetic help in dealing with thesis administration matters. In finalizing this thesis, I owe a special debt to Mrs Elaine Baxter and Ms Penelope Barrett. Without their thorough and patient copy-editing, this thesis would be unreadable. It is a great pleasure to pay tribute to the Central Research Fund, University of London. Their generous financial support enabled me to carry out fieldwork in Beijing in August 2000. During my stay at the China Academy of Traditional Chinese Medicine, I was particularly touched by the warm hospitality of Professor Wang Shumin. 6 Throughout my time in graduate school, I profited from the guidance of many respected senior researchers. Professor Hiroaki Kani, in the first place, inspired my growth as a student and a would-be researcher. Professor Akihito Suzuki has provided me with invaluable opportunities for academic learning which have developed my research abilities. My special thanks go to Dr Vivienne Lo, Professor Yoshinobu Sakade, Professor Eishi Mrs Haruko Sakomoto, and Mrs Setsuko Nakamura. I always find their outstanding work and passion for research stimulating. I benefited from the Needham Research Institute in various ways. I gratefully acknowledge Mr John Moffett, the librarian, for providing me with access to many relevant sources, and for introducing me to a number of great people and fantastic Scotch whiskies. To everyone I met at the Needham Research Institute, I would like to record my gratitude for their willingness to share their brilliant ideas with me. In particular, I am grateful to Dr Kim Taylor for organising the Text Reading seminars, which were always profitable and enjoyable. Dr Hsiu-fen Chen and Dr Sumiyo Umekawa are like my elder sisters at school. I thank them for their friendly advice and sensible perspective on academic and personal issues. My debt goes to my school friends, Dr Maki Kaneko, Dr Naoko Ito, Dr Akiko Ito, Dr Zhang Zhejia, and Mrs Atsuko Kumagai for their friendship. Together we have experienced the joy of intellectual pursuit as well as the depressing deadlock one encounters in writing a dissertation. My thanks also go to my most caring and good-humoured friends Ms Rudeewan Mikhanom and Ms Nomidhi Goldy, who saved my student life from loneliness. What fun we had together in London. Words fail me to express my appreciation to my parents, Shichibee and Emiko Daidoji, whose love and faith in me are my pride and joy. Their persistent confidence in my ability has continued to propel me forward. Many thanks go also to my parents-in-law, Fumio and Masako Murata, for assisting me like a member of their own family. I am very grateful to my husband, Yuichi Murata, in every possible way, for his understanding, indulgence, and sacrifice. Finally, to my daughter, Kanako, who has sometimes been unbelievably naughty, but has made me tougher than ever, thank you. 7 List of Tables Table 1: Characters and literal meaning of karada /107 r1 Table 2: Characters and literal meaning of mi /108 Table 3: Characters and literal meaning of kokoro /116 Table 4: Characters and literal meaning of tamashi 7/116 Table 5: Characters and literal meaning of kokoro mochi /116 Table 6: Characters and literal meaning of mime /117 Table 7: Characters and literal meaning of hara /122 Table 8: Characters and literal meaning of hara no uchi /123 Table 9: Other expressions with hara /124 Table 10: Characters and literal meaning of konare IX 3 7 Table 11: Food Damage symptoms /179 Table 14: Kan: separation of the soul from the body /187 Table 15: Massage for acute symptoms /189 Table 16: Water cures in Bydka suchi /203 List of Disease Names in suchi /229 List of Illustrations Illutration 1: Dressing /91 Illustration 2: Bone setting /92 Illustration 3: How to correct a transverse position of the foetus /95 Illustration 4: Inshoku yojo kagami (Rules of dietary life) /142 Illustration 5: Massage after a meal II82 Illustration 6: Pressure to treat convulsions in a baby /190 Illustration 7: Massage when a new bom baby does not give its first cry II90 Illustration 8: Pressing down hi reversal during pregnancy II91 Illustration 9: Pressing down ki reversal during pregnancy II91 Illustration 10: Pressure to treat urine retention after childbirth IX92 Illustration 11: Pressure to treat sudden dizziness from anaemia IX 92 Illustration 12: Pressure to treat rigidity after childbirth IX 93 Illustration 13: Pressing the buttocks in case of sudden vaginal bleeding IX 93 Illustration 14: Pushing and striking to treat sleeping sickness IX95 Illustration 15: Water dripping device /203 Illustration 16: A man suffering from cold damage falls into a river, and afterwards the disease is cured /211 Illustration 17: Affusion for yin reversal /212 Illustration 18: Using water for a child suffering from smallpox /212 Illustration 19: Abdominal massage 1/271 Illustration 20: Abdominal massage 2 /271 Illustration 21: Abdominal massage 3 1212 Illustration 22: Abdominal massage 4 1212 Illustration 23: Liu Yuancheng avoids a venomous snake on the way to the castle /308 Illustration 24: Water dripping device 1331 9 Chinese Dynasties Zhou dynasty Western Zhou dynasty Eastern Zhou dynasty Spring and Autumn period Warring States Qin dynasty Han dynasty Former Hay dynasty Later Han dynasty Three Kingdoms Jin dynasty Western Jin dynasty Eastern Jin dynasty Northern and Southern dynasties Sui dynasty Tang dynasty Five dynasties Song dynasty Northern Song dynasty Southern Song dynasty Liao dynasty Jin dynasty Yuan dynasty Ming dynasty Qing dynasty11th century-221 period period Azuchi-Momoyama period 1573-1603 period 1868-1912 Taisho period 1912-1926 Showa period 1926-1989 11 Introduction Scope of thesis Keeping healthy is a matter that concerns not just medical professionals, but all of us. This thesis is about images and expressions of the body and illness in popular nineteenth-century Japanese texts. Coming from a non-medical background myself, I became interested in the amount of information on staying healthy that circulates among us nowadays through the medium of books, magazines, television and so forth. Some of this material appears to follow advances in medical knowledge, and to be based upon experiment and argument. But at the same time it often seems speak to images of the body and illness that we have unknowingly internalised. For instance, vending machines offer herbal \"circulation tea which is supposed to promote good circulation in the body. Pharmacies sell purgatives that eliminate \"lodged faeces as a slimming aid. Products like these point to a potential fear of stagnation and concern with circulation among the Japanese public. Later I read a great deal of literature that showed how biological phenomena such as pain or chronic ailments are sometimes moulded within a social/cultural and historical context; and circulation is just such a case. Many of these images can be traced back to pre-modem times. This is a case history of how a pre-modem health manual speaks of the body and illness, as reconstructed from the analysis of a text of late Edo-period Japan, Bydka suchi (What a household with sick persons should know), written 1 Coca Cola, 2006. 2 See for example Yamada Keiji and Kuriyama Shigehisa to igaku (Shibunkaku, Kyoto), and Otsuka Yasuo (et al.) 1999, Medicine and the History o f the Body (Ishiyaku EuroAmerica, Inc. Publishers, Tokyo). Kuriyama Shigehisa (ed) 2001, The Imagination of the Body and the History ofBodily Experience (International Research Centre for Japanese Studies, Kyoto). 12 by Hirano Jusei and published between 1832-1835. It is a text in the \"cultivation of life\" (yojo or ydsei in Japanese) genre, with a special focus on obstetrics. Hirano Jusei was a relatively well-known physician who left more than ten texts in his name on subjects ranging from medicine to national history. * In Japan, the Edo period (1603-1867) saw an explosion of interest in health, and a large-scale health market grew up to meet the resultant demand. Fuelled by the development of publishing culture and increased literacy, countless books on health and medicine circulated. Japanese medicine owed its theoretical and practical basis largely to the Chinese medical tradition, which was founded upon complex philosophical and natural studies. Prior to the Edo period, medical knowledge in Japan had mostly been restricted to an upper-class intellectual elite. In the Edo period however, a number of health manuals and annotated texts that digested and transmitted complex and difficult medical knowledge became available to the general public. The notion of \"cultivation of life\", known as yojo in Japanese {yangsheng in Chinese), has its ultimate origins in ancient China, as the pursuit of a higher and more sophisticated way of life through managing the body and mind. The knowledge and practice of yojo began to be transmitted to Japan around the seventh century CE. In the Edo period, yojo took shape as a phenomenon that became an everyday concern for many people, and crossed social class lines. ICabayama (1976) provides a matrix for the understanding of yojo texts in Japan, as follows. Yojo texts are usually written in simple language, and are aimed as much at non-medical lay people as at medical professionals. In most cases the authors are medical professionals or at least have substantial medical knowledge. Being manuals of popular practical medicine, these texts often cover such topics as hygiene, dietetics, basic physiology, nursing, 13 medicine, first aid, and simple remedies. The authors set out to produce books with a broad popular appeal, and so they suited their style and content to a mass audience, and tried to make them relevant to the everyday lives of their readers.3 Tracing the development of yojo culture in Japan, one sees that Japanese yojo diverged substantially from its Chinese counterpart in the process of transmission. Bydka suchi epitomises one of the \"Japanised\" versions o f yojo concepts and practice. What are the characteristics of Bydka suchi ? Firstly, Byoka suchi deserves in-depth examination because it explicitly shows the full range of medical knowledge possessed by the author. It incorporates various kinds of medical knowledge from internal medicine to surgery, paediatrics, obstetrics and gynaecology in a single volume. It consists of eight fascicles, the third of which is devoted to obstetrics, while the seventh and eighth fascicles are devoted to midwifery. It is also worth noting that Bydka suchi emphasises the necessity of precise, accurate knowledge for the non-professional attendant caring for a patient at home. This is clearly manifested in the title itself #IIyC ^P C ^{3, which I translate as \"What a household with sick persons should know\". In fact bydka $1$^ can be literally translated as \"the sick\"; however in Byoka suchi the term refers to the family members as well as the patient. Moreover the instructions in the text are addressed not only to the sick person him/herself, but often to the attendant as well. Thus the translation of the title tries to reflect both context and content. Seeking basic principles from the vast resources of the traditional classics, Byoka suchVs practices actively utilise up-to-date knowledge and the author's own experience. Secondly, Bydka suchi can be considered from the perspective of how the author sets out to disseminate knowledge about the body and illness. Bydka suchVs author is Kabayama Koichi 1976, 'Yojoron no bunka', in Hayashiya, 435-471. 14 committed to writing about medical matters in plain language, directed at lay readers who may be less familiar with medicine. His endeavours to digest medical knowledge are most explicitly manifested in the unique expressions for the body and its disorders employed in Bydka suchi.. ' In particular, I would like to pay special attention to the writing system used in the text. This text is written in both Japanese phonetic script and Chinese ideographs, most of the latter being provided with Japanese phonemic readings termed furigana. In the Edo period, academic works including many medical texts were written in Chinese ( kanbun ). It is naturally assumed that such texts were addressed to those who had a certain educational background. Yet the usage of furigana as a reading aid brings interesting transmutations that emerge from the hybrid of Japanese and Chinese: a term represents both the original meaning of the Chinese ideographs as used in Chinese and the meaning of the Japanese word used to gloss them. Take a > b tc drawn from the Bydka suchi , as an example. The Chinese characters literally denote qi4 and blood, which are the two most vital components of the human body in traditional Chinese physiology. Meanwhile the appended furigana karada is a common Japanese word for \"body\" in the Edo period. It can therefore be assumed that this collocation expresses the author's perception of the body as fundamentally consisting of qi and blood. In this sense, it is possible to say that the text is a vector for the transmission of medical knowledge in two dimensions: from Chinese tradition to Japanese scholarly physicians, and to Edo-period Japan; and from Edo-period medical professionals to the ordinary Japanese householder. 4 Qi (pronounced ki in Japanese) is the most essential concept in East Asian medical tradition. It used to be translated with terms such as 'pneuma' or 'energy' or 'vapour'. However, it is widely accepted that none of them can precise render qi, which is a far more complex notion. Therefore recent scholarship has preferred to leave the term qi untranslated. This paper also supports this view, and hereafter qi or ki (in the context of Japanese medicine) will be used without translation. 15 Similar free combinations of Chinese characters and Japanese readings are often found in popular literature of the Edo period. However, it is rather unusual for a yojo text to utilise this device, and Byoka suchi succeeds thereby in presenting a vivid picture of body and illness. Compared with other yojo texts of the period, the variety offurigana in Bydka suchi is noteworthy. Let us consider, for example, Ydjokun i l \u00a3fjl| (On cultivating life, 1713) by Kaibara Ekiken (1630-1714), the most famous \"cultivation of life\" text of the Edo period.5 The text is written with both Chinese characters and Japanese phonetic script, but furigana are rather rare. For instance, the most frequently used term for the body is the character # , without any furigana. Surveying the yojo literature of the early nineteenth century, one finds that in many texts, furigana are appended to at least half, or the vast majority, of Chinese characters, but the pattern of readings is more fixed than in Bydka suchi . For instance, in Chomei eiseiron (Discussion and cultivating life, by Motoi Shisho 1813), furigana are appended to more than half of the Chinese characters, though not to all of them. The Chinese character $ ! is always read either karada or tai. Without exception, the reading karada (body) is appended to the Chinese character f t, and the reading konare (digestion) to the Chinese characters In Yojoben (Discussion of cultivating life, by Mizuno Takusai 1842), furigana are provided for most Chinese characters, but the readings are not as varied as in Bydka suchi. With regard to terms for the body, the author uses the Chinese characters # , $1, and The furigana shintai is always appended to while f t and 1$ are always read karada. # is read Edojidai josei vol. 43 (Taikusha, Tokyo). 16 either mi, shin , or most frequently, no furigana reading is provided.7 In contrast to these texts, Bydka suchi provides furigana for almost all Chinese characters. There are 17 patterns of Chinese characters for the reading karada , as we shall see later (Table 1, page 104 of this thesis). For the reading konare , there are 16 patterns of Chinese characters, as shown in Table 10 (page 134 of this thesis). What effect is obtained by these furigana ? Themes and existing studies Thematically, this thesis intends to address the fundamental hypothesis that an examination of Bydka suchi will illuminate the ways in which the ideas and specialised terminology of medical tradition were explained in more familiar language during the Edo period. With particular attention to the effect of the writing system, my analysis will bring to light a pattern of innovative Japanese interpretation of Chinese medical tradition; and in particular, the relationship between Chinese tradition, Japanese scholarly physicians and the lay public, who are understood to form the main audience of this text. To complete this research as an integrated whole, each section will provide a different approach to this overarching theme. Before describing the structure of this thesis, it is necessary to refer to some preceding studies of the history of yojo culture in Japan that are relevant to my project. Firstly, Mugitani (1995)8 investigates the theory and practices in the famous Ydjokun of Kaibara Ekiken, demonstrating both influences and differences from Chinese tradition. For instance, in addition to the preservation of the physical body, Kaibara attaches special importance to cultivating the mind, which seems to 7 Yojohen by Mizuno Takusai 1842. Facsimile 1999. Edojidaijosei Yokoyama, 235-257. 17 indicate the influence of trends in China, particularly from the Song period (960-1279) onwards. On the other hand, Kaibara's yojo practices differ from Chinese tradition in two aspects: Firstly he excludes practices related to Daoism, which constitute one of the core elements in China. Secondly Kaibara does'not give medical prescriptions with amounts of ingredients, as is commonly done in Chinese cultivation of life texts. Mugitani considers that these divergences from Chinese models are mainly due to the dominance of Confucianism as an official teaching during the Edo period, and Kaibara's awareness of differences between China and Japan in geography, customs, and physical constitution. As Ydjokun became a prototype for subsequent yojo texts of the Edo period in terms of structure, theory, and practices, these findings can be applied to many other yojo texts of the period, including Byoka suchi . However, more than a hundred years lie between the publication of Ydjokun and Bydka suchi ; therefore it may be possible to point out further differences that are characteristic of the late Edo period. Furthermore, Mugitani, as a scholar of Chinese thought, does not enquire into possible differences in pathology and physiology between Chinese medical tradition and the medicine of the Edo period, which I wish to explore further. For the significance of furigana in relation to medicine, I have benefited from Kuriyama (2004)'s study of shaku. A culture-specific Japanese term, shaku is the name for an intense shooting pain in the area of the stomach. It was a common ailment until around the end of nineteenth century, but later gradually disappeared from both medical diagnosis and the everyday speech of laypersons. Kuriyama discusses the decline of shaku as an issue of linguistic translation as well as broader transfers in technology and social organisation (such as changes in the sense of time). As the Westernisation of medicine proceeded at the national level, shaku , a 18 disease within the framework of traditional medicine, was adapted and translated into other terms in accordance with new (Western) medical theory, such as liver cancer, hepatitis, and other medical conditions. Eventually this affected the experience of the disease itself.9 Although the root of shaku goes back to the ancient Chinese disease called ji (accumulation), in Japan shaku became different from its Chinese ancestor. He demonstrates that during the Edo period, shaku could be written with any number of /wnga\u00aba-character compounds that generated various different pathologies (I shall later return to the idea of shaku in the Edo period and specifically in Bydka suchi in Chapter 2). In a passage that is particularly germane to my study, Kuriyama claims that \" furigana-characiQr compounds epitomize in their very form the hybridity that defined Edo medicine in general... Theories and practices imported from China profoundly influenced Japanese doctors, and this influence was reflected in the wholesale adoption of Chinese terminology. But... knowledge of sickness in the Edo era was molded in the tension between the enthusiastic embrace of foreign notions and the persisting sense of their foreignness\". 1 0 Rather than a mere pronunciation guide, he considers furigana as 'conceptual translation', a means to translate or interpret the ideas of Chinese medicine in Japanese indigenous vocabulary. Hereafter I will refer to the particular use of furigana in Bydka suchi as 'conceptual translation'. At the very outset of my research, this statement made me aware of the possibility of studying furigana in the discourse of medicine. Kuriyama argues that Western scientific translation eventually dissolved the traditional notion of shaku. However it is my challenge to focus on the semantic differences and gaps between Chinese characters and furigana , which is more 9 Kuriyama Shigehisa 2004 History Transposer, Naturaliser, 27-41. 1 0 Kuriyama 2004, 31. 19 subtle and tends to be neglected. For this purpose, Bydka suchi is an excellent subject to examine: While on the one hand it adopts Chinese medical terminology, on the other hand the furigana often appear to belong to the everyday speech of laypersons. Through the analysis of medical terms and their readings, I wish to shed light on some unknown aspects of the relationship between Chinese tradition, Japanese doctors, and the lay public in the Edo period. Structure of thesis The thesis will be divided into three chapters. To begin with, I use historiographic and biographical methods to delineate the cultural background of Byoka suchi and its author in the context of the early nineteenth century. In so doing it is necessary to make clear the position of Bydka suchi in the history of yojo culture in Japan. Thus introductory Chapter 1 reviews the intellectual background of yojo culture. It sets out to give an outline of yangsheng (cultivation of life) in China, which exerted a great influence on Japanese yojo culture. In the process of importing and disseminating ideas and practices from China, Japanese yojo evolved certain features that differentiate it from its Chinese counterparts. These characteristics of yojo will be related to the contemporary social/cultural environment with reference to relevant secondary sources which offer eclectic insights on the subject. The second chapter focuses on the annotated text of Bydka suchi. It begins with a survey of the historical and cultural features of the early nineteenth century in order to set the scene within which Bydka suchi was written and read. It goes on to present the biography of the author Hirano Jusei, his works, and the content of Bydka suchi. Although his personal background remains largely unknown, a few recent works of scholarship have tried to shed light on his life, his writing, and the medicine that he 20 learnt and practised. Secondly, it presents a textual analysis which examines the perception of the body and illness in Byoka suchi. Focusing on the expressiveness of compounds of Chinese characters and furigana , it explores selected terms and treatment methods that play a key role in the pathology and physiology 6f Byoka suchi. Through comparisons with both Chinese texts and other texts of the Edo period, it elucidates the intricate relations of the various medical views that Bydka suchi transmits to its audience. Chapter three is devoted to a translation of the first fascicle of Bydka suchi with meta-commentary. Two things justify this endeavour. First, this fascicle concisely discusses the main points of all eight fascicles: basic regimen, physiology, pathology, the roles of physician, patient and attendant in treating illness, and so forth. Some features are further delineated in other fascicles, and introducing the first fascicle will give a glimpse of them. Secondly, close analysis of the furigana reveals a graphic image of bodily experience in familiar, colloquial language. The gaps and dislocations between medical terms in Chinese characters and Japanese readings show how Chinese traditional medicine has been digested by a Japanese doctor. Furigana is not the mere replacement of one word or phrase by another; it is a conceptual translation that reflects the author's medical vision to the fullest extent. Therefore a translation that focuses on furigana can reconstruct the meanings of a term in both the denotative and the connotative dimension. 21 Chapter 1: Intellectual Background of Cultivation of Life \u2014 Historiography and Review of the Literature Introduction The variety of approaches to the study of cultivating life reflects the complexity of its nature. The first chapter begins with a brief account of cultivating life {yangsheng in Chinese) culture in China, an ensemble of concepts and practices concerning \"how to look after one's life and health\" and \"how to live one's life\". The theoretical and practical foundation of Japanese yojo largely comes from Chinese tradition, so it is necessary to acknowledge the fundamental ideas and practices of Chinese yangsheng at the outset of our inquiry. Some of the major yangsheng texts will also be introduced, especially from the viewpoint of their influence in Japan. Next I would like to survey the process of transmission of yangsheng culture from China to Japan. In particular, Japan saw an explosion of interest in cultivating life culture during the Edo period, and a large-scale health market grew up to meet the resultant demand. With the development of publishing culture and increased literacy, countless books in the genre were sold and read. It can be affirmed that the cultivation of life phenomenon became a daily concern for many people, crossing lines of social status. This introductory chapter has three intentions: Firstly, it sets out to provide an essential matrix for understanding the cultivation of life. By reviewing the historiography and main texts both in China and Japan, it will impart a basic notion of its aims and practices. Secondly, the chapter will discuss the main characteristics of cultivation of life culture in Edo-period Japan. An examination of some of the 22 insights from recent studies will allow us to observe the dissemination of ideas and practices. It will also elucidate the social and cultural environment of our annotated text, Byoka suchi , which was published in the early nineteenth century. The second point leads to the third aim: to view cultivation of life culture in a mu6h larger context so as to highlight the differences between China and Japan, focusing particularly on the Edo period when the trend peaked. Chinese yangsheng culture exerted a considerable impact in the surrounding countries such as Korea and Japan. However Japanese scholarship has for long habitually read as yosei in a Chinese context, and yoyo in a Japanese one, thereby clearly differentiating the two1 1 . Why is that? It suggests that just as Chinese yangsheng evolved in so many aspects during its history of more than two millennia, so too the cultivation of life culture of Japan and Korea developed certain specificities. Many of the features that characterise Japanese yojo culture emerged only when the practice began to flourish during the Edo period, but certain differences in Chinese and Japanese yangsheng/ yojo practice are noticeable even at an earlier stage. Introducing some of the relevant analyses, I wish to scrutinize the features of Japanese cultivation of life, particularly in the Edo period, and to evaluate the meaning and contribution of Bydka suchi in its history. As to terminology, in order to differentiate the strands of cultivation of life in China and Japan, and for the sake of consistency, this paper will hereafter refer to the former as yangsheng (the pronunciation of in Chinese), and the latter as yojo (the pronunciation of in Japanese). 1- Cultivation of life in China 1 1 Takizawa 1998, 18. 23 1-1-1. Yangsheng culture: concepts The idea of yangsheng in China first appeared during the Warring States period (480-221 BCE). What is yangsheng? In English, it is often translated as \"cultivation of life\", or \"nurturing life\". However, there is probably an inherent ambiguity in the term itself. What should one cultivate or nurture and how? For instance, we find the way of yangsheng referred to at the beginning of the medical classic Huangdi neijing (Yellow Emperor's inner canon)1 2 in the part called Suwen (Basic questions). In ancient times, there were people called true men: those who live in accord with the changes between Heaven and Earth, grasp the changes between yin and yang, breathe vital essence, preserve the spirit within without depending on other forces, and keep the body unchanged. Therefore true men flourish on Heaven and Earth by their longevity, and do not perish. It is because they have 1 ^mastered the Way . Here the \"true man\" is usually understood to be a perfected human being, i.e., an immortal. \"The way\" indicates the way of yangsheng. In medicine, the ideal way 1 2 The extant Huangdi neijing consists of three recensions; the Taisu (Great basis), the Suwen Ufo] (Basic questions), and the Lingshu (Numinous pivot). Each of these is a compilation of a number of short texts containing various separate topics discussed within a distinct medical lineage, through which classical medical concepts developed. As for the process of formation of Huangdi neijing , opinion varies. However there is a consensus among modem scholars that the texts collectively represent medicine as it matured from the second century BCE at the earliest to around the second century CE, and that the compilation dates to between 100 BCE and 100 CE. For an extended discussion of the history of its textual tradition, see Nathan Sivin 1993, 'Huang of the Compilations; The Significance of the Structure' (Ph.D. Thesis, University of California, Berkeley), 67-157, and 265-323. Suwen (reprint 1963, Renmin weisheng Beijing), tianzhenlunpian 2. 24 is manifested in \"the sage [who] treats the disease which has not occurred yet\"1 4 ; thus the primary concern of medicine and the principle of yangsheng both resonate in the passage above, with its focus on prevention. It may be said that the way of yangsheng is to be approached by considering these two questions: (1) WMt should one do in order to stay alive? (2) What kind of life should one lead? These themes, which are inherent in the ideas of yangsheng , permit the greatest latitude in approaching the subject, taking in aspects of philosophy, religion and medicine, as well as other fields. For instance, the Fangji (Recipes and techniques) section of Yiwenzhi (Record of literary pursuits), the oldest extant bibliographical treatise in Hanshu i t H (the History of the Former Han [CE 32-92]), is classified into four categories; Yijing [SEU (medical and Shenxian Yijing deals with medical theory and acupuncture; Jingfang is concerned with clinical medicine, mainly using drug therapies; Fangzhong instructs in sexual techniques; and Shenxian contains techniques including breath-control, exercise, massage, elixir and the like. Here there seems to be a differentiation between Yijing and Jingfang as medicine, and Fangzhong , and Shenxian as yangsheng. Every category is deeply concerned with various aspects of yangsheng , but none of them can cover the whole range of yangsheng. Recent scholarship has shown how the complexities of yangsheng led to a diversity of approach and interpretation in modem studies. Yangsheng has been studied in such fields as medicine, Daoism, Buddhism, Confucianism, ideas of immortality Will ( : xianshen ), and the Lao-Zhuang tradition (the thought of Laozi and Zhuangzi). Daoism, the Lao-Zhuang tradition, and the study of 1 4 Suwen, 'siqidiaoshendalunpian 14. 25 immortality stand in close but intricate relations with one another. Particularly after the publication of Les procedes de (nourrir le principe vital) dans la religion taoiste by Henri Maspero1 5 , who argues that yangsheng practice belongs in the framework of Daoism, the borders between these fields became very vague with regard to yangsheng practice. Nowadays many scholars consider that strict categorisation is to be avoided.1 6 Taking this view, I would like to stress that the study of yangsheng culture is fraught with controversy; suffice it here to acknowledge that each of these subjects is indispensable for an understanding of the Chinese tradition of cultivating life.1 7 Confucianism, Daoism, Buddhism, and ideas about immortality all mingle in the theory of yangsheng culture. For example Mengzi (Mencius), one of the representative Confucian philosophers, understood the idea of yangsheng within the framework of socio-political doctrine. The individual is bound to the community and assigned a social role within it. A harmonious society is regulated by the mutual obligations between self and family, and between self and society.1 8 The perfection of one's personal nature also embraces a higher public spirit. This is based on the idea that, viewing the administrative order and social morality as an enlarged version of family structure, the correct behaviour of the ruler will have a civilising effect on the other members. On the other hand, Daoism, in principle, assigns the highest priority to longevity and immortality. Instead of being a matter of collective 1 5 The Japanese translation was published in 1983: translated by Mochida Kimiko 1983, Dokyd no yoseijutsu (Serika, 1 Press, Kyoto), 27. Donald Harper (1998) also gives an account of the relationships among yangsheng culture, philosophy, and the immortality cult (xian fib), Early Chinese Medical Literature, Prolegomena , (Kegan Paul International, London and New York), section 4. 1 8 Mugitani 1995, 236. Vivienne Lo 2001, 'The influence of nurturing life culture on the development of Western Han acumoxa therapy' in Hsu, 23-26. 26 existence, yangsheng in Daoism rather prioritises the subjective achievement of life and well-being for the individual.1 9 In addition to the representative types of yangsheng practice we have mentioned, various other kinds of techniques were added as time went by. Yet despite the differences, there are certain affinities between them. These include the idea of qi (ki in Japanese) as the most fundamental principle of life, and the concept of jingluo (vessels) where qi circulates within the body. Qi, a sustaining force for all phenomena in the universe, provides the indispensable framework for the whole theory and practice of yangsheng. The more closely we approach it, the more inexorable the reality of qi becomes. As there are many stages in the development of the concept of qi, a different understanding appears in every different historical and social context.2 0 Qi flows ceaselessly through Heaven, Earth, and human life, and all phenomena from weather to climate are manifestations of the interaction between yin qi and yang qi. Human life, the body and illness are viewed in terms of correlative relationships of qi between the macrocosm of the universe and the microcosm of the human body. Qi circulates around the body, and is manifested in respiration, while the structure and make-up of the human body are also explicated by qi as a vital constituent. In other words, the dissolution of qi means death. In the famous aphorism of the ancient master of thought Zhuangzi: '' Human life is the accumulation of qi. Accumulation creates life, whilst dissolution leads to death\".2 1 Man basically has two kinds of qi. Inherent bodily qi, which is derived from the 1 9 Lo 2001, 24, A. C. Graham 1989, Disputers of the Tao: philosophical argument in ancient China (1 1 1 . Open Court, La Salle), 53-64. 2 Tokyo), 4-36. 2 1 Zhuangzi By Zhuangzi iff-T, Warring States. Zhuangzi jijie (annotated by WangXianqian 1975, Bailing chubanshe, Hong Kong), Chapter 2 2 ,'zhibeiyou ig ', 138. 27 jing (essence) received from one's parents, provides the very basis for the formation and growth of life and the human body. The other kind of qi is acquired by means of the outer body, by breathing, eating and drinking, whereby the vitality of the body is nourished. Jing usually indicates the finest quality of qi, and in sexual cultivation, it specifically refers to semen. It is often discussed in a triad with qi and shen # (spirit), which resides in the body. Although both shen and jing are crucial components of human life, the former is usually understood to be essentially metaphysical whereas the latter is relatively physical .2 2 As to the physiology of qi, Huangdi neijing explains that the movement of yingqi (structural qi) and weiqi #T^, (protective qi) in conjunction with the jingluo manifests in the circulation of qi around the body like a river. The source of it is jing, the essence derived from ingested food and drink, and in general terms yingqi is understood as blood and weiqi as bodily fluids. Jingluo , the network of flowing qi within the body, is principally divided into jingmai HIM and luomai The former, jingmai, consist mainly of the twelve regular jingmai - the main passages of qi - and the eight qimai which connect the twelve jingmai. The latter, luomai, are split off from jingmai , and run throughout the body, covering it like a net. Of the remaining yingqi and weiqi, the impure part is discharged as excretion, whilst the pure part is stored as zongqi which is associated with breathing. Zongqi is stored in the chest and moves through xin mai the heart vessel and the lung, thereby promoting respiration. Within the body, qi is stored in the five viscera 3ElIi^ (wuzang: the liver, heart, spleen, lung, and kidney )2 3 and six entrails AJKf (liufu: 2 2 also examines the historical development of the concept of jing in yangsheng culture: Harada Jiro in Sakade, 342-378. 23 Nathan Sivin 1987, Traditional Medicine in Contemporary China (Center for Chinese Studies, 28 large intestine, small intestine, stomach, triple burners, gallbladder and urinary bladder), and it circulates in the inner body through the vessels. This was a commonly shared idea in ancient China, and it became the predominant doctrine for another two millennia in the general medical thought of East Asia, let alone yangsheng culture. The concepts of circulating qi and jingluo are inseparable from the concern with controlling and preserving qi which forms the central theme of yangsheng practice. 1-1-2. Yangsheng practices Breath-regulation, gymnastics Yangsheng practices are roughly divided in two types: yangxing H ^ (cultivating the [physical] form) or i i # yangshen (cultivating the body), and yangsheng i l # (cultivating the spirit). The former refers to promoting the health of one's physical body, whilst the latter is broadly concerned with maintaining an optimal mental state. I would now like to give a brief account of the major yangsheng practices, following the categorisation by Kubo (1977), who identifies five practices of yangsheng: breath-regulation S iS (tiaoxi), therapeutic gymnastics (daoyin cereals (bigu\\ dietetics H U fi? (fushi\\ and sexual techniques M ^ (fangzhong).2 4 First of all, the statement in Zhuangzi quoted below is often discussed as a very early reference to qi control practices during the Warring States period. University of Michigan, Ann Arbour), 265. 2 4 KuboNoritada 1977, Dokyoshi (Yamakawa, Tokyo), 30. 29 To huff and puff, exhale and inhale, blow out the old and draw in the new, do the 'bear-hang 9 and the 'bird-stretch9 , interested only in long life \u2014 such are the tastes of the practitioners of 'guide-and-pull 9 exercises, the nurturers of the body, Grandfather Peng9 s ripe-old-agers .2 5 ' The passage refers to two of the most crucial practices of yangsheng : therapeutic gymnastics and breath-regulation . 2 6 Although the implications of therapeutic gymnastics vary, Hua Tuo UP'fe, a legendary physician of the Later Han dynasty, explains its principles and efficacy thus: The human body needs exercise $7 #J (laodong), although it should not be taken to extremes. Through movement, it is possible to dissolve the qi of cereals, transport the blood, and prevent disease 2 7 This is likened to the hinge of a door that never rots [or rusts] because it is constantly in motion. Here, therapeutic gymnastics is described as moderate exercise, which aids the digestion and the circulation of blood around the body thereby preventing disease and achieving longevity. Daoyin literally means 'guiding and pulling'; according to the interpretation in Zhuangzi, dao M - refers to inviting external qi into the inner body, while yin B I means pulling the body .2 8 The medical texts of the early Former Han dynasty recovered from the Mawangdui burial site also bear witness to the practice .2 9 They include the gymnastics chart of forty-four forms {daoyintu). In addition, Houhanshu t& lW t (History of the Later Han), tells us that Hua Tuo invented a type of therapeutic gymnastics called 'the play of the five 2 5 Zhuangzi, 'geyi translated by Augus Graham 1981, Chuang-tzu: The Inner Chapters (George Allen and Unwin, London), 265. 2 6 Sakade 1999,17-31, 37-47. 2 7 Houhanshu (History of the Later Han), compiled by Fan Ye yQl\u00a5 in 445. Reprint in 1965, Zhonghua shuju, Beijing, 82 jun xia, 'fangshuzhuan jjW izk', Huatuo 1 8 Zhuangzi, 'geyi $j\u00ae;' (Zhuangzijijie, 96). 2 9 The Mawangdui burial mound is located in Changsha Hunan province in China. The tomb, closed in 168 BCE (estimated date), was excavated in the early 1970s. For an English translation, see Harper 1998. 30 animals jfL'fetJc (wuqinxi)\\ This is a form of exercise imitating the movement of five animals: the tiger, deer, bear, monkey, and horse. In these ancient texts, therapeutic gymnastics is understood as a mean of promoting health, and ultimately attaining immortality. As well as being a means of attaining longevity, daoyin is also sometimes employed as a medical treatment. With time, the practice became further diversified, and it is closely connected with the growth of Daoism. Therapeutic gymnastics is more than a mere stretching exercise, as it should involve the practice of breath-regulation, in order to exchange the old qi of the inner body for the fresh air that fills Heaven and Earth. Ge Hong's Baopuzi (Book of the master who embraces simplicity, fourth century CE) claims: Man exists within qi, while qi exists within the human body, and from Heaven and Earth to the myriad things, nothing is created without qi. Therefore one who is good at circulating qi is able to attain health for the inner body, while repelling external evil .3 0 There are a number of methods and ways of practice. Beiji Qianjin Yaofang { /H (Essential prescriptions for urgent need worth a thousand gold pieces, by Sun Simiao [d. 682]) describes exhaling muddy or turbid qi through the mouth, and inhaling pure qi through the nose, and the annotations explain that exhaling signifies the removal of the old qi, which is also called dead qi, whereas inhaling is the intake of fresh qi, which is also called live qi?1 In breath-regulation, it is crucial to concentrate on bringing qi deep within the body. We find a statement 3 0 Baopuzi, compiled by Ge Hong (283-343 CE), early 4th Reprint 1996, Baopuzi neipianjiaoshi juan 27' yangxing # 1 4 ', 'diaoqifa 582. 31 in the Zhuangzi: \"True men breathe with their heels ( zhongxi ) whilst ordinary people breathe with their throats\"32 . Dietetics and abstinence from cereals What to eat and how to eat is a matter of great importance in preserving one's health. Abstaining from cereals is based on the notion that one can preserve the purity of qi and attain longevity by avoiding the intake of rice, barley, wheat, millet and the like. For instance, Baopuzi considers that the dregs of cereals make the intestines dirty, and that this should be avoided in order to gain immortality. It is claimed that people who eat cereals can achieve knowledge, but not longevity .3 3 Instead of cereals, drugs made from other plants or minerals are recommended as the ideal diet. This is one of the rules that the would-be immortal has to follow. Dietetics entails prescribing and ingesting those medicines or foods that are believed to be efficacious for maintaining health or prolonging life. Having its roots in the idea of immortality, it largely owes its pharmacological content to hencao the materia medica tradition .3 4 Abstinence from cereals, dietetics, and ingesting elixirs are all closely connected with the idea of becoming immortal. A glance at several texts tells us that mineral drugs were commonly prescribed as well as drugs of plant and animal origin. At what point these mineral drugs came to be used as a means to become immortal is 3 2 Zhuangzi , 'dazongshi ( Zhuangzijijie, 37). With reference to ancient physiology, Ishida (1988) tries to analyse this ambiguous statement as more than a mere metaphor. He maintains that \"breath by the heel\" refers to long, deep breaths, which becomes just possible when we take account of the route of zong qi, relevant to respiration, as it is assumed to reach qi jie % (qi route) which is located around the ankle. Ishida Hidemi 1988, 'Shosoku ko\\ in Sakade, 80-115. 3 Akahori 1989, 'Drug taking and immortality' in Kohn, 73-97. Engelhardt 2001, 'Dietetics in Tang China' in Hsu, 175-191. For the historiography of bencao in to 'Honzo to Doky5', in 32 yet unknown. However Wushi' er bingfang (Recipes for fifty-two illnesses), a collection of medical recipe texts from Mawangdui, includes mineral drugs that later became drugs for aspiring immortals. The connection of mineral drugs with immortality is also mentioned in Shennong bencaojing (Shennong's , alchemy is twofold: external and j cinternal. With the former, one uses a natural substance to create gold or concoct an elixir that one then takes physically in order to become immortal. The idea is that one receives the eternal qi of the macrocosm into oneself by means of other things that are eternal, thereby bringing into play the mutual correlations between nature and man. The trend of external alchemy (waidan peaked during the Sui and Tang dynasties. In contrast, inner alchemy ( neidan ) evolved on analogy with laboratory alchemy from the Tang dynasty onward. Regarding the body as an alchemical furnace, inner alchemy attempts to produce a higher level of purity within the body by refining inner yin qi and yang qi . As practice, it involves breath-regulation, meditation, and sexual cultivation. For instance, one concentrates the mind on visualising qi circulating in the inner body (neiguari), or on viewing the divinities that reside in one's body (zunsi). By and by, one becomes filled with them .3 6 By prolonging the existence of the material body, the Daoists aimed to achieve immortality and transcend physical death. In contrast to the persistence of both the internal and the external forms of alchemy in China, Japanese The concept and history of external and internal alchemy is referenced by Fabrizio in Kohn, 464-497. 3 6 For further detail, see Joseph Needham 1976, Science and Civilization in China vol. 5, part 3.

Miura 2000,100-255, Ishida 1987,185-305. 33 scholars did not show much interest in the alchemical practices. Sexual technique Sexual cultivation (fangzhongshu ) is literally \"the art o f' the bed chamber\". Addressing the treatment of illness and the pursuit of longevity, it developed detailed instructions regarding the positions, frequency, and intensity of therapeutic sexual encounters .3 7 Aiming at harmony between yin qi and yang qi , i.e., female and male, the method is designed, in general terms, to retain semen, the essence of male yang qi which can bring about human longevity, through well-regulated sexual intercourse. Among the texts recovered from Mawangdui, Shiwen +Fr3 (Ten questions), Tianxia zhidao tan (Discussion of the highest way under Heaven), and He yinyang (Harmonising yin and yang) all focus on sexual cultivation. In addition, the Fangji section of Yiwenzhi, the bibliographical treatise of the Hanshu , contains a list of many works concerned with sexual cultivation. Yiwemhi explains that the aim of fangzhong consists in cultivating life: \"If one enjoys it (fangzhong ) with regulation, it will be moderate and extend the lifespan. On the other hand if people do it excessively so as to neglect themselves, it results m illnesses and damage to life\" . The practice involves the man endeavouring to refrain from ejaculation, which results in losing semen, i.e., jing the essence. He should take the woman's finest qi (at the moment of orgasm), and return it to the upper dantian 1 5 (the elixir field, or the site below the navel), a process that is called \"returning essence and replenishing the brain Like many 3 7 For the origin, theory, and practices of fangzhong, see Douglas Wile 1992, Art of the Bedchamber (State University of New York Press, Albany), and Umekawa Sumiyo 2004, Sex and Immortality: A Study o f Chinese Sexual Activities for Better-Being (Ph.D. Thesis submitted to University of London, School of Oriental and African Studies).

Reprint in 1996, Zhonghua shuju, BeijingJi/UH 30, Yiwenzhi, 1779. 34 other yangsheng practices, fangzhong is employed not only for the purpose of attaining longevity but also as a medical treatment, especially for sexual disorders like male impotence. Although semen should be retained, the total absence of ejaculation may cause qi to stagnate. Moreover by precluding conception, it offends against filial piety, which requires one to leave descendants for the family lineage. Hence fangzhong argues that the proper way of ejaculation depends on age and is subject to various taboos on sexual intercourse, related to date, frequency and so forth. 1-1-3. Yangsheng texts Now let us survey several yangsheng texts with regard to their influence on Japanese yojo culture. Early texts of particular relevance include Yangshenglun Ira (On cultivating life) by Xi Kang (223-262), Baopuzi by Ge Hong, and Yangsheng yaoji (Compendium of essentials on cultivating life) by Zhang Zhan of the Eastern Jin dynasty (317-410 CE). Although Yangsheng yaoji is lost to us today, the fragments preserved as quotations in Chinese and Japanese medical texts enable us to reconstruct the original text to a certain extent. In particular, most of the drugs mentioned in Baopuzi are also contained in Ishimpo HI 4 ^ # (Recipes at the heart of medicine) by Tamba no Yasuyori (10th century CE), the oldest extant medical text composed by a Japanese author. Yangxing yuanminglu (Record of cultivating inner nature and prolonging life) was written by Tao Hongjing (456-536) during the Liang dynasty (502-557). Tao Hongjing is also known as the hencaojing (Shennong's materia medica) and Zhengao flUfir (Declarations of the perfected), the latter a work of twenty sections which discusses Daoist doctrine and his view of 35 nature. By the Tang period, most yangsheng practices of which we know today had more or less fully evolved. Beiji qianjin yaofang incorporates a compilation of preceding thought and practice in addition to material by Sim Simiao himself. Sun Simiao wrote two separate yangsheng texts at different times in his life, the first being Qianjinfang (Prescriptions worth a thousand gold pieces), and the second Qianjin yifang (Revised prescriptions worth a thousand gold pieces). Volume 27 of Qianjinfang contains eight sections that are relevant to yangsheng : General overview Daoist yangsheng H , Dwellings IMassage Breath-regulation Dietetics Prohibitions of the Yellow Emperor and Sexual techniques Chapter 14 of the Qianjin Yifang, entitled tuiju (retired life), describes the ideal way for an official to live a retired life. It includes such matters as how to select land and build a house, taking drugs, dietetics, gymnastics and bathing, the use of incense, the making of medicines (prescriptions and cultivation of herbs), and various incantations. In Chapter 12, \"great examples of cultivation of the old and \"dietetics of cultivation for the elderly B 9\" are discussed from the standpoint of filial piety. Sun Simiao lays heavy emphasis on the importance of dietetics for nurturing the elderly. These texts cover a wide range of everyday activities, from eating to sleeping, from disciplining the self to deciding where to live. Yangsheng here is not a mere collection of medical and pharmacological techniques; rather, it represents a systematised body of knowledge in which such diverse elements as medicine, pharmacology, topography, religion, customs, and ancient Chinese folklore are all interwoven. Sun Simiao's teaching exerted a great influence in Japan, where many 36 reprints and annotated editions of Beiji qianjin yaofang were published. A bibliographical investigation by Mayanagi (1994) reveals that Qianjinfang was imported eighteen times in the course of the Edo period, ranking seventh highest among all imported Chinese medical texts. Qianjinfang was reprinted as many as twelve times during the Edo period .3 9 Kaibara Ekiken, the author of Ydjdkun, mentions Sim Simiao as '' the founder of cultivating life, who wrote Qianjinfang. It establishes the principles of all things for both the art of cultivating life and medicine \".4 0 From the Song dynasty onwards, the art of yangsheng underwent further change. The literati, who showed much interest in the high arts, enjoyed a lifestyle that laid emphasis on leisure. For instance, Shouqin yanglao xinshu (New text for the longevity of parents and cultivation of the old), by Zou Xuan $$$& of the Yuan dynasty (1271-1368), was quite popular in its time, and was often quoted in Edo-period Japan as well .4 1 Many of the main texts listed above are included in Daozang iK/io (the Daoist canon), compiled during the Ming dynasty (1368-1644) when the publication of yangsheng texts reached its peak. In the reign of Emperor Shenzong (reigned 1563-1620), Hu Wenhuan iM zStJjfe compiled sixteen yangsheng texts, which he published as Shouyang congshu (The Collection on longevity and cultivation). Zunsheng bajian (Eight discourses on respecting life, 1591) by Gao Lian SKe, and Shesheng zongyao fe U (General outline for regulating life) by Hong Jiuyou also appeared in 3 9 Mayanagi Makoto 1997, bibliographical studies relating to manuscripts and transcriptions in Japan, see Kosoto Hiroshi 1989, Senkinhd shoshi gaisetsu', in Shinohara, 17-39. 4 0 Ydjdkun, 133. Regarding the religious thought and medical views of Sun Simiao, see Sakade 1999, 246-282. Yu no baai\\ In Sakade, 379-427. 37 the Ming. As time went by, yangsheng practice came to pursue not merely the cultivation of the body, the prevention of diseases and the prolongation of life; it further embraced a whole range of activities to enrich both body and spirit. In so doing, yangsheng culture was elevated to a systematic art and philosophy of how to live a life of better quality .4 2 In importing these Chinese texts, the physicians and philosophers of Edo-period Japan must have come across the concepts of refined living elaborated by the Song and Ming literati. Finally we need to mention Korean medicine, which also received many Chinese influences, and became a highly developed medical system in its own right. In particular, one should note Dong' eui Bogam (The precious mirror of Eastern medicine, 1610), written by Heo Jun a court physician in the service of King Sonjo during the seventeenth century. Displaying a rich knowledge of medicine from the Chinese classics, including the subject o f yangsheng, it was highly appreciated in Japan, too .4 3 4 2 For example, taking the example of Zunsheng hajian, Chen (2009) examines how yangsheng came to dominate the lifestyle of the literati elite in the late Ming. Reflecting the flourishing material culture of the times, Gao Lian considers such subjects as furniture, artefacts, horticulture, travel, and haute cuisine as essential parts of yangsheng practice.

Nukii Masayuki 2007, 'Higashi Asia no bunka koryti- of life culture in Japan 1-2-1. From antiquity to the early seventeenth century: Phase of imitation In contrast to the popularity of yojo in the Edo period, as evidenced by the enormous number of published cultivating-life texts, and the growing interest of modem scholarship in this phenomenon, the situation in the preceding era has received far less attention from historians. This is mostly due to the relatively small number of extant texts .4 4 It was around the fifth century CE that Japan began to receive mainland medicine through contacts with Korea. From the seventh century onwards, Japanese medical knowledge and practice further benefited from direct transmission from China. The emergence of medical texts of Japanese authorship begins in the early ninth century. The earliest known medical texts referring to yojo practice include Daido Ruijuho (Classified collected prescriptions of great unity, 808) by no Hirosada jTJSISf and Abe no Manao Kinranho orchid prescriptions, 868) by Sugawara no Minetsugu W Jfjl^ P 4 6 ; Setsuyd ydketsu (Essential formulas of cultivating life, 827) by Mononobe no Kosen consisting of twenty chapters4 7; and Yojosho (Extracts on cultivating life, 877) by Fukane no Sukehito Of these texts, Yojosho 4 4 The historical background of yojo culture in its early days is largely based on preceding scholarship. Sakade Yoshinobu 1989, Kokusho s5mokuroku:hotei Tokyo), vol.7, 884. 39 and Setsuyd yoketsu are lost to us today. Although Japanese medicine at that time more or less followed the pattern of contemporary China, aspects of the On-myodo (The Way of Yin and Yang) \u2014 evolved from astrology, and interwoven with magico-religious features \u2014 are also noticeable in practices like exorcism49. The thinking of yojo was largely Daoist in flavour, reflecting cultural trends in Sui and Tang China. However this Chinese-oriented medicine circulated mainly among the aristocracy and the imperial court, and little is known about the medical scene among the population at large. Ishimpo is the oldest extant work on Japanese traditional medicine, written by Tamba no Yasuyori (912-995) and presented to the Emperor Enyu R M in 984.5 0 We find the greatest value of Ishimpo to lie in the substantial number of quotations and extracts from Chinese medical classics, some of which were lost early on in China proper. The quotations contained in Ishimpo come from 204 different ancient sources, and help with reconstructing the original shape of the lost texts .5 1 References to yojo techniques are scattered throughout the text of Ishimpo . Chapters 19 and 20 discuss the applications of mineral drugs and their problems. Chapter 26 deals with various methods, including abstaining from cereals. Chapter 27 consists mainly of instructions on how to achieve longevity and well-being. Chapter 28 discusses the sexual cultivation necessary to attain immortality, and Chapter 29 is on dietetics. The contents of Chapter 27 on yojo are divided into eleven sections: general overview the valley spirit, i.e. cultivating the spirit cultivating the body Si breath-regulation R M , therapeutic gymnastics ^\u00a331, activating the mind, i.e. daily regimen f f T \\ sleep f^^ 2, proper language 'm M , 4 9 It was believed that the exorcism of an evil spirit or demon would cure illnesses. Many thoughts and practices o f On-myodo resonate with Buddhism, astronomy, astrology, Daoism, Confucianism, and folklore. 5 0 Ishimpo Yasuyori (984), reprint chubanshe, Beijing). 5 1 Hattori 1980, 139-140. 40 clothing A M , dwellings MiR, and various prohibitions Tamba no Yasuyori does not use his own words to express ideas and practices, but entirely relies on quotations. Despite great similarities to Chinese yangsheng practice, Sakade (1989) demonstrates that certain efforts have been made by the compiler of Ishimpo to construct chapters that reflect his own views .5 2 For instance, Chapters 19 and 20 discuss the ingestion of mineral drugs, but unlike many Chinese texts with a religious orientation, Ishimpo also points out the poisonous nature of some of the prescriptions and registers a strong objection to their use. Furthermore, the discussion of longevity treatments in Chapter 27 omits all mention of ingesting mineral drugs. The fact still remains that mineral drugs were very popular at the Japanese court during the ninth and tenth centuries . Yet the suspicion of mineral drugs recorded in Ishimpo probably marks the first separation from Chinese influence. In Chinese yangsheng tradition, the trend of waidan (i.e., mineral drugs) peaked during the Sui and Tang dynasties. However, it is generally said that the later rise of neidan within the Shangqing _h Daoist sect was a reaction to growing knowledge of the dangers of waidan (often sulphur poisoning ) . 5 4 The exact reason for this abandonment of waidan in Japan is not clear. However, as the practice of waidan is fundamentally inseparable from the idea of immortality, the lack of emphasis on 5 2 Sakade 1989, 5-9. Yamada (1997) demonstrates that in quoting the first pathological text in China, Zhubing yuanhoulun (Causes and symptoms of medical disorders, by Chao Yuanfang MzjtJj, Sui) (hereafter referred to as Yuanhoulun ), Ishimpo almost always omits the parts on vessels theory, which is an indispensable element in Chinese medicine. Yamada Keiji Yuanhoulun By Chao 1991, edited by Ding Guangdi (Renmin weisheng chubanshe, Beijing). 5 3 Fujikawa 1952, Nihon igaku shi (reprint 1972, Iji tsushinsha, Tokyo), 87-89. 5 4 However, Sakade (1988) claims that the development of neidan (inner alchemy) is not only due to the realisation of elixir ingestion as poisonous, but is closely related to the idea of neiguan (internal visualisation) after the Song dynasty. 566-599. rise of neidan after Song, Juji 1988 'Goshin-hen shiso' in Sakade, 600-627, immortality in Japanese yojo (especially after the Edo period) may have something to do with this difference. The subsequent centuries saw very little writing on the subject of yojo after Ishimpo , and what few texts there are do not go beyond the replication of Chinese practices. Major yojo texts known to us today are Chosei ryoyoho (Methods for longevity, 1184) by Shakurenki Eisei hiyosho notes for cultivating by Tamba no Yukinaga and Kanen yosho (Important notes for one's spending years, 13th century) by Tamba no Tsugunaga They are all written in kanbun (i.e., Chinese as written by the Japanese), and are more or less similar to Ishimpo in contents. Kissayojoki (Drinking tea and cultivating life, 1215)byEisai belongs to the same period. It refers to methods of drinking tea in relation to yojo practice. Eisai was a priest who went to China to study Buddhism; on returning to Japan, he founded the Rinzai Zen sect as well as introducing the custom of tea-drinking. Two further texts from the period spanning the Kamakura i t # (1192-1333) era and the Muromachi (1392-1573) era are Fukudenho (Prescriptions of the fields of blessedness), written by a Buddhist priest Yurin around the 1360s (the exact date is unknown); and Enju ruiyo (Classified of prolonging life, 1456) by Takeda Shokei t!f [BBSS!, which consists of quotations from the Chinese Yangsheng yaoji. From the late fifteenth to the early seventeenth century was the Age of Civil Wars. Through a succession of armed conflicts, medicine developed, out of necessity, both in theory and practice. In contrast to the absence of yojo writings from the twelfth to the fourteenth centuries, many yojo texts were composed. For instance, Manase Dosan ft ulL$IiftH (1507-1597) wrote Yojo hishi instructions of cultivating life) and Jufuku shichichin (Seven marvels of longevity and happiness), both on the subject of yojo techniques. Yojo monogatari \u00a7p (The tale of cultivating life) is said to be the work of his adopted son, Manase Gensaku (1598-1631), who also wrote Enju satsuyo M # \u00ae H (Assembled essentials of extending life), published in 1599. Although Enju satsifyd does not depart radically from the account given in Ishimpo , the emphasis on cultivating the mind is noteworthy ,5 5 Nagoya Gen'i (1628-96) was the founder of Koiho (the Classic School), which particularly advocated clinical experimentation and empiricism. He paved the way for the new characteristics of Japanese yojo theory with his criticism of Daoism in Yojo shuron (Main theory of cultivation of life). Kokon yojoroku (Record of nurturing life through the ages, 1692) by Takenaka Tsuan belongs to around the same time. Quoting a substantial number of texts from various historical periods as its title suggests, it is tantamount to an encyclopaedia of yojo practice. To summarise yojo practice before the Edo period, all in all it rarely diverged from the pattern established by Ishimpo , which was largely based on medical trends in China. However, as the centuries passed, some deviations from Chinese practice arose. For instance, Japanese texts tend not to assign an important role to mineral drugs, abstinence from cereals or alchemy. In China, yangsheng practices are closely associated with longevity and immortality, as they proceed from religious thought and philosophical tradition, especially Daoism. But such religious zeal was not entirely shared in Japan. Rather, the desire to attain immortality was to some 5 5 Eisei 6: 265-267. (6th volume of the Eisei bunko page 265-267). Eisei bunko is a an anthology of cultivating life texts, which was published by Kyoiku shincho kenkyukai between 1917-1918, It consists of six volumes, containing forty-four texts, mainly of the Edo period. Hereafter Eisei alone is used to indicate this source of information, followed by volume and page numbers. 43 extent replaced by the concern for temporal welfare, i.e., how to achieve well-being. 1-3. Yojo culture during the Edo period: review of the literature I have digested the words of the ancients, transmitted the will of the ancients, and developed them. I have also heard many things from my seniors. Where I have experimented by myself and found certain practices efficacious, I have referred to them, even though they are merely my supposition. This is the crux of cultivation of life (epilogue of the Ydjdkun [Kaibara, Ekiken, 1713])5 6 . As people's interest in health grew around the sixteenth century, yojo writers gradually began to present their own views of life. The rise in the number of yojo texts from the Edo period onward is spectacular, and it is estimated that no fewer than two hundred yojo texts were appeared. These texts not only functioned as a medium for the transmission of information about health, but also reflected their authors' religious, philosophical or ideological thinking. Edo-period yojo culture truly bloomed with the appearance of Ydjdkun by Kaibara Ekiken, which indeed brought the genre to new heights of complexity and artful technique. The text not only brings together a highly substantial body of knowledge on yojo drawn from earlier sources in both China and Japan, but also provides a philosophy of how to live one's life into which the author's experience and personal views are fully integrated. So influential and popular was this work that it was reprinted more than ten times in succession, and it has retained an unchallenged position from the author's time till the present day. Almost no yojo text published after Ydjdkun is free 5 6 Ydjdkun, 174. 5 7 Tsukamoto Akira 1995, 'Kenyaku to yojo', in Yokoyama, 305. 44 from its influence, and many scholarly works on yojo culture mention Ydjdkun as a prototype of the (early) Edo-period yojo text. After Ydjdkun , the upsurge in yojo culture peaked in the early nineteenth century, and approximately forty percent of the extant Edo-period yojo texts date from that time, including the annotated text, Byoka suchi. What kind of cultural phenomenon was yojo? And what brought it such popularity? To answer these questions, it is necessary to be aware of the methodologies of preceding scholarship, which have made it possible to reconstruct the historical significance of Edo-period yojo culture .5 8 1-3-1. How should one live one's life? One of the most distinctive features of Edo-period yojo culture is the emphasis on \"how one should live one's life\". Rather than pursuing \"how to stay alive\", i.e., longevity and immortality, it became more concerned with the quality of life. Of course life is priceless: as Chomei eiseiron states, \"Life cannot be replaced by any money or jewels. Longevity is the best happiness of all\"5 9 . However in the late Edo period the tendency to pursue the enrichment of one's life rather than attempting to lengthen it became more apparent than ever. For instance, Suzuki Akira $T jyfcI]ll in Yojo yoron (Crux of cultivating life, 1834) maintains that longevity \"mostly depends on luck\" 6 0 , and explains his version of what practice should aim at. People use the expression \"to forge\": By heating and striking repeatedly, one 5 8 Tatsukawa Shoji 2001, Yojokun ni manabu (PHP, (Taishukan, Tokyo), 9 Chomei eiseiron, J i jo-1, 6 0 Eisei 1: 107. 45 forges a sword. By soaking in water, hitting and drying, one forges [dresses] leather. Associating with good people, being buffeted by wicked people, undergoing troubles, hardship, worry and fear, one forges one's mind. Suffering from cold and heat, going through trials and tribulations, working diligently and selflessly, one forges one's body .6 1 This passage asserts that the crux of yoyo lies in facing the realities of life, and in managing to endure them. It does not necessarily prolong one's lifespan or bestow greater health. This attitude wrought a certain change in yojo practice. Whether good or bad, enjoyable or hard, the way of yojo tries to see meaning in all the incidents and actions of life, and practice thus becomes extended to every aspect of life. I would like to examine this tendency from two perspectives: firstly, deviation from the Chinese yangsheng tradition, and secondly, the expansion of yojo practices and concepts. 1-3-2. Detachment from the Chinese yangsheng tradition As Edo-period yojo culture evolved its own features in the process of detachment from Chinese yangsheng tradition, interest in Daoist-oriented practices faded. In the previous section, we surveyed five major yangsheng practices: breath-regulation, therapeutic gymnastics, abstinence from cereals, dietetics, and sexual cultivation. In contrast, Edo-period yojo culture shows less interest in abstinence from cereals and sexual cultivation; moreover, alchemy is rarely mentioned. Ydjoydron is extremely critical of Daoism: 6 1 Eisei 1:130-131. 46 The dietetics internal visualisation and breath-regulation of Daoism are absurd...Since the time of Qin and Han, hoshi (fangshi, the men of skills), those who talk about the art of immortality all talk nonsense .6 2 Firstly, in contrast to the practice of abstaining from cereals to avoid muddy qi, most Edo-period yojo texts acknowledge the significance of cereals as a principal food. For instance Yojodan (Argument of cultivating life, Tani Ryokan ^ TH3, 1801) argues for the benefits of cereals: \"One exercises and uses up vital essence day and night. But vital essence is not exhausted, because it is nourished by the ki of cereals. If the ki of cereals runs out, vital essence also dies out .\"6 3 Bydka suchi also explains that there is no reason for the Japanese to eat heavy animal meat, \"The rice and cereals of our country are better than those of any other country. The rice that we usually eat is most excellent in taste and rich in nourishment compared with foreign products \".64 There was controversy over the consumption of animal meat, but the authors of Edo-period texts generally accept cereals (rice, barley, wheat, millet, and so on) as staple foods for dietetic purposes. Their central concern is revealed in remonstrations against excessive eating, and they mostly discuss cereals from a digestive and nutritional standpoint, but not in relation to the idea of immortality. Secondly, Yojokun describes the way of replenishing jing (Jf# sei in Japanese) essence by sexual cultivation, as set forth in Beiji Qianjin yaofang . The author, 6 3:60. 6 4 Bydka suchi, fascicle 2, page 2 (hereafter, BS alone is used to indicate the source of information, followed by fascicle and page numbers, e.g. BS 2: 2). Fascicles 1-4 were published in 1832, and 95, 96 (Taikusha, Tokyo). 47 Kaibara Ekiken, admits the efficacy of this as a method to preserve essential ki {qi in Chinese) without suppressing uncontrollable sexual desire . 6 5 However, most Edo-period yojo authors after Ydjdkun disapproved of sexual cultivation for various reasons. Some considered it neither plausible nor possible, \"It (sexual cultivation) is absurd and unreasonable {Yojoketsu Formula of cultivating life, by Onei koji 1835).\"6 6 Others criticised it as selfish. There were also those who censured Kaibara Ekiken, although it is not certain if he himself carried out sexual cultivation. Qianjinfang includes sexual cultivation, saying that this practice brings longevity...This is all nonsense begun by Daoism, and nothing but absurdity. Just because a man wants to become immortal, how can he trouble and exploit one hundred and twenty women? It is absolutely against benevolence...How could Master Kaibara employ this practice, speaking as if it were plausible? It is very unlike him {Yojo yor on).6 1 On the other hand Chomei eiseiron exhibits a lenient attitude towards sex, writing \"No one in the world dislikes it (sexual pleasure It should be fascinating and entertaining \".6 8 Nonetheless there is no mention of the techniques of sexual cultivation. This text tolerates human desire as long as it remains within the framework set by the author. As these texts demonstrate, sexual intercourse is often discussed in terms of credibility, morality and asceticism, but not as a mean of cultivation by acquiring essential ki from partners. 6 5 Ydjdkun , 98-99. Onei koji is 1:127. 68 *Chomei eiseiron, jo-10. 48 Breath-regulation remains the topic in many Edo-period yojo texts. In particular, breath-regulation combined with meditation is highly recommended as a way of calming the mind and preserving the body in Yasen Kam a (Idle talk on a night boat, 1757) by Hakuin (1685-1768), who contributed \"much to the rise of the Rinzai Zen sect of Buddhism .6 9 The term doin (daoyin in Chinese) also appears in many yojo texts. However, in contrast to the Chinese versions of therapeutic gymnastics, Japanese doin is presented more as massage S or various kinds of \"work\", from physical exercise to one's family profession, as a means of making ki circulate within the body. The idea of vocation as yojo practice will be discussed later. Relatively few texts present the kind of therapeutic gymnastics with yoga-like movements such as stretching and swaying that we typically find in the Chinese yangsheng texts. In Ydjdkun , the influence of Chinese tradition can be seen in the author's advocacy of Qianjinfang , in addition to his acceptance of sexual cultivation,. Kaibara Ekiken notes approvingly that almost all later yojo texts have their theoretical basis 7Hin Sun Simiao's Qianjin yaofang and Qianjin yifang. This high regard for the text is one thing, but approval of Daoism seems quite another, Ydjdkun acknowledges the efficacy of sexual cultivation as a way of preserving health, but does not mention longevity or immortality. Rather Kaibara shows his disapproval of Daoism by describing Sun Simiao as \"a man of occultism H I# who was fond of Laozi and 71Zhuangzi\". He cnticises the idea of immortality as not being the Way that a man of virtue should follow, \"Men who master the art of immortality are inclined to 6 9 Eisei 2:221-244. 7 0 It is mentioned in 7 1 Ydjdkun , 133. It is usually said that Sun Simiao was a man of Daoism as well as medicine. Yet a few recent studies have also revealed the fact that he advocated Buddhism. See Yamazaki Hiroshi 1981, Chugoku Bukkyo, bunkashi no Chugoku shisdshi no kenkyu (Tokyo University Press), Part 2:1 appendix. 49 cultivating qU and do not like reasons. Hence they abandon the proprieties and do not perform service \".7 2 Mugitani (1995) examines Ydjdkun , showing that disenchantment with the idea of immortality dates back even earlier .7 3 Ydjdkun is edited and reconstructed from Kaibara's earlier yojd text Isei tenyo (Essentials of cultivating life)7 4 , and nearly thirty years lie between the publication of these two works. Isei tenyo consists of a general discussion followed by sections on cultivating the mind moderation in eating and drinking refraining from sexual desire circumspection in daily conduct harmony with the four seasons 1 Z 9 therapeutic gymnastics and breath-regulation taking medicines moxibustion taking care of the old 4 1 ^ , cherishing children and the taste for pleasure There is also an appendix on the desire for descendents > } t |13. Isei tenyo makes almost no mention of such Daoist-oriented practices as abstinence from cereals 1^1$, meditation or UnS), elixirs or sexual cultivation By the time he came to write Ydjdkun , Kaibara chose to dispense with other sections as well, including daily conduct, harmony with the four seasons, therapeutic gymnastics and breath-regulation. The later work contains a general discussion _ h T s followed by sections on eating and drinking drinking alcohol drinking tea, with an appendix on smoking refraining from sexual pleasure the five senses (proper conduct) 2lT\u00a7\\ urination and defecation U lI!, bathing preventing illness selecting physicians IREI l, using medicines ffilSI, taking care of the old raising children acupuncture 1 2 Ydjokun , 42-43. 7 3 Mugitani 1995, 243-246. 7 4 Modem scholars consider that Isei tenyo was initially written by Kaibara's pupil, Takeda Sadanao and later edited by Kaibara. Mugitani 1995, 242. 50 and moxibustion The division into sections reflects the author's intention to make the text suitable for everyday practice. Drinking alcohol and tea has become independent of dietetics, and the sections concerning daily hygiene are newly added. In Ydjdkun , the human body is seen as \"weak and fragile\", just like \"the flame of a candle in the wind\"7 5 , and the actual contents mostly centre on instructions for everyday activities and behaviour. Of course it is not the case that Edo-period yojo texts ignore longevity completely, but interest in immortality tends to decrease as time goes by. Instead the chief practice of yojo shifts to the preservation and good management of mortal life. 1-3-3. Expansion of practices and concepts Art of yojo The application of yojo practices expanded to take in every possible aspect of life, and the range of subjects addressed in the texts became much wider and more diverse. Yojo texts began to cover not only physical and mental health, but also the social, financial and cultural aspects of life. For instance Yojoben includes a wide range of social activity as yojo practice, including physiognomy, economy, running a household, professional work, human relationships, morality and so on. At the end of this book, such worldly topics as physiognomy, hidden virtue, and marriage are treated. This may seem like abandoning the true intention of cultivating life. However, in cultivating life, there exists both inner cultivation and outer cultivation. The inner kind refers to moderation, to refraining from such things as eating, drinking and sexual pleasure in order to prevent illness. 7 5 Yojokun, 32. 51 On the other hand, the outer kind indicates carefully examining and become aware of one's position, leading descendants to filial piety by accumulating hidden virtues, and harmonising husband and wife by improving one's marriage. The crux of moderation is to correct one's outer behaviour, thereby preventing oneself from receiving harm from others... Even if one masters the methods of inner cultivation, it is difficult to fulfil one's heaven-given lifespan if one loses *7Athe way of outer cultivation. The author claims that \"inner cultivation refers to practice for the sake of bodily health, while \"outer cultivation ^ 3 1 4 -\" refers to social and cultural behaviour relating to morality and relationships, Yojo practice extends literally to every action of life. Ydjdkun presents as yojo practice detailed instructions for daily conduct which aim at building proper templates for one's behaviour. For instance, in order to prevent the legs from going to sleep, one should \"wiggle and flex the big toes vigorously and repeatedly\" before trying to stand up .7 7 Or when one boils water to make tea, \"when the water starts coming to the boil, some cold water should be poured in \",7 8 and so on and so forth. These set patterns are all called \"arts $|f (jutsu )\". It is considered that arts, the forms learned through bodily experience, also regulate the mental state. For Kaibara, \"art {jutsu )\" means such things as agriculture, crafts, literature, tactics, cookery; they are all the products of \"arts\", not just of Confucianism. There are all sorts of human accomplishments. We call an art the way in which 7 6 Yojoben, shohen l l f e j o Ai, 4. 7 7 Ydjdkun, 107. 7 8 Ydjdkun , 95. 52 an accomplishment is perfected. All accomplishments require that an art should be learned to perfection. Nothing can be done without knowledge of the art of it. Even minor, mean accomplishments are impossible unless one learns the art 7Qthey involve. ' This passage suggests that Ydjdkun considers yojo as the art of techniques for preserving life and disciplining the body, thereby managing body ki in various ways. Kitazawa (2000) explains that jutsu (art) in yojo practice implies the quality of action and requires a certain training and sophistication. Whatever the yojo practice may be, from walking to eating to pursuing one's occupation, one needs to carry it out repeatedly until it becomes second nature. Through the process of overcoming one's desires or difficulties, the practice gradually comes to feel natural. Only when one can do it without any intentional effort, does the movement for the first time reach the height of elaboration that deserves to be called \"art \".8 0 Both good and bad are the result of habit. It is the same with self-regulation in cultivating life and performing one's duty. Both accomplishing one's duty diligently and suppressing one's desires in order to maintain self-restraint - if one makes an effort to practise, these good things will eventually become habitual. They become natural and no longer cause pain .8 1 This suggests that a concern for proper forms and habitual training resulted in yojo practice becoming more involved with bodily experience than with the mind. Commitment to the physical body is also found in Byoka suchi , which explains the 7 9 Ydjdkun , 36. 8 0 Kitazawa Kazutoshi 2000, \" Nihonshi (Heibonsha, Tokyo), 8 1 Ydjdkun , 52. 53 methods of breath-regulation and walking as a step towards \"harmonising the mind through form \".8 2 8 3 In associating education with yojo, Y5jd hitokotogusa (A word about cultivating life, 1824) epitomises the expansion of yojo in terms ' 1 of both practice and concept. The author, Yasumi Keizan A P /I Jl: ill, considers that the crux of yojo lies in applying it in various cultural activities in daily life. He claims that, from clapping hands to playing with balls, dolls, and kites, all children's play may be regarded as yojo practice. Calligraphy, study, etiquette, archery, horse riding, swimming, fencing, martial arts, reciting - these are all the initial and indispensable means of developing one's nature and ability. We usually employ teachers and have children start learning from the age of six or seven... Children first learn the alphabet, the numbers from one to ten, and the directions of north, south, east and west. It is the initial step of yojo to learn such things. In the quotation above, \" yojo\" appears to be almost synonymous with \"way\" or 8 2 BS 1:13. 83 *Tsujimoto associates the focus on the body in yo/o practice with the dissolution of Neo-Confucianism among Edo Confucians including Kaibara Ekiken. Zhu Xi (1130-1200) employed the notion of li 91 (principle), which belongs to the metaphysical in contrast to qi which belongs \"below physical form\". Viewing qi as a manifestation of li, li becomes an ultimate reality, which is metaphysically transcendent and prior to any physical form in time and space. In discussing the human body, the idea of li gives heavy weight to the priority of mind over the body. Regarding the influence on yangsheng practice, mind cultivation is given a higher value than any other physical practice. Kaibara Ekiken, however, suggests that qi alone represents all substantial existence, and li is merely the regularity and the order of the universe which consists of qi. Daigiroku (The record of great suspicion) by Kaibara Ekiken 1714. shiso taikei 34 (Iwanami shoten, Tokyo, 1970), 17. Tsujimoto claims that this brought two shifts in viewing the human body. Firstly, the body becomes de-metaphysical, mortal and vulnerable. Secondly, Ydjdkun largely replaced the Neo-Confucian concern with li and mind with the preservation of qi and the body. Tsujimoto Masashi 1997, 'Kyoiku sisutemu no naka no shintai', Shiso 6, 28-47. For the relation of Neo-Confucianism and medicine, see Unschuld 1985,153-158. For how Edo Confucians researched into the relations of mind and body, see Takahashi Fumihiro 1990, Kinsei no shin-shinron (Perikan, 1990, Tokyo). 54 \"procedure\". It is even more interesting to find that yojo practice is extended to animals as well: \"Cows, sheep, dogs, horses, dogs, cats and birds which live long due to yojo, cultivation of life .\"8 4 Cultivation for animals is probably unthinkable for Chinese yangsheng , and so we see that the meaning of yojo has been extended as well as the range of practices. The expansion of yojo practices echoes the expansion of \"yojo\" as a concept. For example many texts argue for the importance of being economical or frugal in life, making an analogy between \"yo/d (cultivation of life)\" and \"being economical\". For instance, Kaibara's Ydjdkun draws a parallel between cultivating life and frugality. From youth to old age, one should be frugal with one's vital essence (genki )... If one nourishes it only after one gets old and languishes and the body becomes weak, it is just like living in luxury when one has fortune and wealth and practising economy only when one becomes poor and lacks means... Apply the word 'stingy' So ( shoku ) in cultivating k i8 5 Nakagami Kinkei 1817) criticises any profit-making activity as not suitable for practitioners of cultivating life, \"However little, even if the thought of making a profit occurs only once, it is not yoyo \".8 6 Here we find the term \"yd/d\" is used almost synonymously with \"frugality\". With regard to such ambiguous terminology, Takizawa (1998) advances the possibility that several concepts relating to life, health and morality were in fact not precisely distinguished within the 8 4 Eisei 1:271-281. 8 5 Ydjdkun, 52-53. 8 6 Eisei 5: 104. 55 vocabulary of the general population. The expansion of the concept of yojo in the late Edo period manifests just such a pattern of thinking among the general public. Yojo theory came to include such values as \"thrift ^ $ 3 ( kenyaku )\", \"hidden virtue (intoku) \" and \"harmony fnJlH ( w a ju r i) These different concepts, which in reality overlap with one another, become unified under the practice o f \" yojo\"} 1 1-3-4. Yojo and society Increase of practitioners When we examine yojo texts, it is necessary to consider not only what practices are involved, but also from whom and to whom the knowledge was transmitted. Although many of the writers remain unknown, there is a demonstrable variety of background in the authorship of yojo texts. Nagoya Gen'i, author of of Bydka suchi are known as doctors. Yet they are not the only yojo writers. For instance, Takai Bankan iWWffJliL, who wrote including Ehon Sangoku Yofuden (Tale of the siren of three dynasties, 1804). Sato Taminosuke is assumed to have been a Shinto priest from the content of his Toshidamashu ^ 3 \u00a3 ^ | (Collection of annual jewels). As these examples show, people of varied professions wrote yojo texts, but particularly those in the field of literature. On the other hand the question of the audience of yojo texts is difficult to clarify. To some extent, it is possible to speculate on the basis of such factors as publishing 8 7 Takizawa Toshiyuki 1998, Kenko bunkctron (Takshukan, Tokyo), 35-36. This was first pointed out by the famous folklorist of the early twentieth century, Yanagida Kunio HUT Yanagida claims that before the spread of \"literate culture\", such terms as \"diligent \"honest IE p H \", \"careful \"robust and \"healthy MUS\" were not 28-30. 56 culture and popular education, in conjunction with the style and register of the text. Firstly, recent studies reveal that the literacy of the mass population had reached a notable level by the early Edo period or even earlier. Some trace the rise of literacy back to the sixteenth century8 8 , but a general consensus attributes the phenomenon to widespread mass education and a thriving publishing culture in the Edo period. With regard to the education of the samurai class (ruling warrior) class, female children were usually tutored at home. On the other hand, males could receive education at the school of their fief. However, most of the fief schools appeared in the second half of the Edo period, and they did not usually provide elementary education. Therefore in order to acquire literacy before progressing to the fief school, samurai children usually had to go to tutors or to the terakoya attended by commoners. Private elementary educational institutions for commoners, where they received a basic education, were called terakoya (literally temple schools). The terakoya classes usually took place at the private homes of samurai, priests, or common citizens, and they multiplied explosively in urban areas. It is said that by the end of the Edo period, approximately 70-80% of boys were attending terakoya , though the percentage of girls is estimated to have been lower.8 9 Even rural areas, though lagging behind, followed the trend. Moreover those who could not afford to go to terakoya and worked as apprentices for large stores were often taught basic reading, writing and calculation for business purposes. Thus it can be reasonably 8 8 Kuroda Hideo 1985, 'Sengoku Shikihoki no gijutsu kyoikushi (Toko shoin, Tokyo) survey the history of educational administration and the educational system. There are also a number of studies of Edo education from perspectives of social and cultural history: Shibata Jun 1991, Shisoshi rekishi 5, 364-362. 57 assumed that not only the upper classes but also many of the merchants, farmers, and craftsmen living in urban areas could manage light reading, such as the circulating kawaraban (broadsides) or popular novels. These were mostly written in Japanese kana script, with readings for some or all Chinese characters appended; ahd many Edo-period yojo texts also employed this written form. Thus it may be reasonable to include a cross-section of society in the possible audience for yojo texts n the Edo period. Secondly the rapid rise of literacy is intertwined with the flourishing of publishing culture. Because of their rarity, printed texts had formerly been enjoyed only by an elite minority. Even during the Edo period, books were by no means reasonably priced. In the late Edo period, it seems that many yojo texts were priced at around 3-7 momme , which ordinary people like retailers or craftspeople could not easily afford.9 0 Instead of purchasing books, however, commoners were able to borrow them from the rental bookshops that sprang up in great numbers to meet demand. Nagatomo Chiyoji (1982, 1987, 2001), a pioneering historian of book culture in the Edo period, examined the emergence of the rental book business in the early 1600s in conjunction with the development of woodblock printing and the increase in the number of popular publications.9 1 From the early eighteenth century, the business began to grow rapidly, and by 1832 there were 800 rental bookshops in Edo city. In 1813 the city of Osaka had approximately 300. Rental bookshops also carried yojo texts and medical texts, although there were fewer of them and they were not as 9 0 Keiogijuku daigaku 58 popular as novels or comics.9 2 Nagatomo (1987) argues that the book rental fee was about one-third to one-sixth the price of a book, so many people could afford and enjoy daily reading. There were also a number of second-hand bookshops, as well as peddlers who sold or rented books, and who undoubtedly contributed to the increased availability of books in rural areas. Takizawa (1998) suggests a possible correlation between two phenomena, the rise of yojo culture and publishing. Firstly most of the Edo-period yojo texts were published in the four big cities of the time: Kyoto Edo city, Osaka and Nagoya where rental bookshops were also concentrated. Secondly there were two peaks in the publication of yojo texts: from the Genroku jg # (1688-1704) and Tempo (1830-1844) eras. Rental bookshops appeared just as the yojo trend first peaked, and the business flourished most when yojo text publication reached its second peak.9 4 In addition to methodologies which basically deduce the readership of texts from factors such as style and register, mass education, and the nature of publishing culture, Yokota (1995) seeks out other historical materials to elucidate the readership of yojo texts. He investigates the book catalogues kept by two rich farmers' families in the suburbs of Osaka from the late seventeenth century to the early eighteenth century, which record every book they acquired through rental or purchase from bookshops and peddlers. Mainly focusing on the circulation of Kaibara Ekiken's works and other medical texts, Yokota shows from these catalogues that the circulation of yojo texts had a foundation at the mass level among the rich farmer class and probably the surrounding population. Not only members of the samurai 9 2 Nagatomo 1987, 49-58. 9 3 Nagatomo 1987, 8. 9 4 Takizawa 1998, 26-28. 59 class, but also a certain number of rich farmers and merchants were in a position to comprehend academic writings such as Confucian and medical texts, as well as popular novels.9 5 The contents of books were transmitted in this way. Firstly there were rich farmers who acquired several hundred books, either by purchase from bookshops or by making manuscript copies of borrowed books. They used bookshops, rental bookshops, and peddlers. Secondly there also existed networks which functioned as distributors of rental books from those households within local communities which \"possessed\" books. This is described as \"the possession of books on a community level\". Thirdly even those people who could not afford books could probably come into contact with books through renting, or through listening to professional storytellers or lecturers. Training halls and temples functioned as venues for village cultural circles where people could gather to borrow books from each other or to listen to stories.9 6 Yokota's study concerns the cultural history of reading. The history of texts should be regarded as a cultural practice. It is concerned not only with printing techniques and collections, but also with how people treat and use printed texts.9 7 As far as Bydka suchi is concerned, we have no historical records or other data to hand that might suggest how the text was handled and read. Nevertheless we cannot help but make draw inferences from a passage in the text itself. The preface of Bydka suchi states: \"the text should be stored in villages where there is no doctor, and should be read aloud to those who are illiterate, including midwives.\" This 9 5 Yokota 9 6 Yokota 1995,328. 9 7 This is initially claimed by Chartier, Roger 1985, Pratiques de la lecture . 1992, Misuzu shob5, Tokyo. 60 instruction by the author seems to fit in with Yokota's observation that the readers were not only those who purchased the text, but also the people around them, those who presumably came across the content through renting, copying or listening to readings or lectures. Evidently the author of our text was well aware of thk various patterns of transmitting knowledge. Yojo and society What does it mean to \"possess\" yojo knowledge and to \"practise\" yojo ways? Over and above the provision of methods of daily regimen and medical knowledge, yojo theories reflect authors' philosophies of how to live, as we have already seen. Owing to the existence of a feudal hierarchy and a Confucian ideology, Edo-period yojo had to construct the meaning of its teaching. For instance, Matsumura (1997) takes the view that in Ydjdkun , yojo practice is clearly distinguished from work. Appropriate \"exercise (rodo)\" during leisure time is a recommended way of yojo practice for the literati, mainly of the samurai class, whereas the household occupation itself is \"exercise\" as a way of yojo for those who live by agriculture, craft, and business. Through this interpretation of vocation, or work, as yojo practice, the concept of yojo was itself endowed with the nature of a social activity. Confucian yojo theory as such not only requires one to manage one's own body, but also provides meaning for all occupations within the social hierarchy, and consequently differentiates the bodies of samurai from the bodies of others.9 8 The samurai should, from an early age, read books, practise calligraphy, and learn etiquette and music, archery, horsemanship, and the military arts, getting plenty of physical exercise. Farmers, artisans, and merchants should each QgMatsumura Koji 1997, 'Yojoron teki na shintai eno manazashi', Edo no shiso 6, 99-115. 61 diligently pursue the duties of their respective vocations from morning to night. Since women, being at home, are susceptible to illness due to stagnation of vital spirit, they should get plenty of exercise by going about their work with a will. Even women of gentle birth should serve their parents, mother-in-law, and husband well, weaving, sewing, spinning, cooking, and rearing children.\" We can note that yojo functioned as a kind of social identity. The association of exercise with the accomplishment of one's vocation became more obvious in the late Edo period. In the case of our annotated text Bydka suchi , for instance, the author Hirano Jusei makes the learning of the yojo art compatible with social duty in two ways. Firstly, it is claimed that one of the most essential ways of cultivating life is carrying out one's vocation.1 0 0 This seems to suggest that the assumed readership of Bydka suchi was probably not men of samurai class, but women and commoners. Secondly, Hirano explains that one should have sufficient medical knowledge in order to give appropriate medical care to one's parents, for the sake of filial piety.1 0 1 In close association with administrative structures and Confucian morality, it is possible to say that these policies contributed to strengthening the framework that regulated the general public. In addition to social identity, how did yojo teachings function within the society of the Tokugawa regime? There were ample grounds for the proliferation of yojo culture in the Edo-period society. If we focus on the nature of yojo texts as a source of home medicine and daily regimen, the trend can be considered within the medical pluralism of that time. It is also helpful to compare this with situations in the contemporary West. 9 9 Yojdkun, 15. 1 0 0 BS 1:7. 1 0 1 BS 1:26. 62 For instance from the study of quackery, Porter (1989) illustrates that there was a decline in regimen over the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries in Europe, which is intertwined with the rise of medicine,1 0 2 Two factors mainly contributed to this shift. Firstly, the phenomenon of \"purchasing medicine to attain health\" became dominant, which undermined the long tradition of physical regimen among middle and upper class households. Medicine and treatment had long been regulated under the monopoly of professional physicians and guilds of surgeons and apothecaries. However their monopoly diminished with the development of the market economy. Secondly, there was a shift in European culture from the strict asceticism of the Reformation to utilitarianism under the Enlightenment. These two factors made it possible to \"buy\" medicine to get health without spending time and effort. On the other hand, Numbers (1977) examines Thomsonianism, the trend of home medicine in the early 1800's in the United States.1 0 3 It firstly offered safety, with adherents claiming that self-medication was safer than being \"doctored to death\". Secondly, the development of a botanical manual could save money. Thirdly, home treatment appeared convenient; and where there were no physicians at all, it was necessary. Fourthly, home treatment enabled women to avoid the embarrassment of consulting male physicians. These investigations offer interesting prospects to consider. They show us that the rise of yojo presents issues such as medical pluralism, drug market economy, and medicine and gender. The gender aspect in yojo culture deserves particular attention because women's embarrassment in clinical encounters is also mentioned in Bydka suchi. The seventh fascicle provides instruction in midwifery and the background to childbirth at a 1 0 2 Roy Porter 1989, Quacks (Tempus Publishing, Gloucestershire, illustrated edition 2000). 1 0 3 Ronald L. Numbers 1977, 'Do-It-Yourself the Sectarian Way', in Risse, 49-72. 63 professional level, and offers good reasons for the use in the home of manuals containing detailed knowledge and techniques. It is always such a humiliation for women to be observed and touched by a physician even for treatment, as they are mostly male. Even though there is no choice when they are suffering, they never forget [the embarrassment]. I once saw a woman who went insane after childbirth and kept saying this [how humiliating it was] day and night. Had those women been treated by a properly instructed midwife, many would have endured less embarrassment, and many could have been saved. This was my motivation to write this text (Zaba hikken What a midwife must study, i.e., the seventh and eighth fascicles of Bydka suchi)}0 4 The author of Bydka suchi is indignant over the - perhaps thoughtless - behaviour of physicians and the absence of support from the people around the woman due to lack of proper knowledge. This shows one aspect of the correlation between the need for domestic care and the writing of a yojo text. As far as home medicine is concerned, Kabayama (1975) describes yojo texts as enlightening in two ways. Firstly, through the comparison of various opinions in various works, one can trace hidden conflicts between different medical schools. Secondly, the texts provide a rich source of knowledge of folk medicine and a lively picture of popular customs.1 0 5 Kabayama sees the flourishing of yojo texts as the result of \"the shift in methods of circulating information from small community-based communication to literate activity on a larger scale. These are the 1 0 4 BS 7:5. 1 0 5 Kabayama 1976, 'Yojoron no bunka', in Hayashiya, 449. 64 conditions created by the general circumstances of urban life.\"1 0 6 Before the rapid urbanisation of the Bdo period, medical knowledge used to be handed down within communities from one generation of practitioners to another. However this tradition may have broken down in rapidly urbanised centres. Kabayama regards Edo-period yojo culture as an urban phenomenon. The lack of public health provision and an unstable medical establishment fostered the need for private health measures. The government took little action in health care, while the rapid growth of the drug market enabled people to purchase medicines wherever they chose. At that time not only apothecaries but any individual could make and sell medicines under their own brand. Physicians often blamed midwives for their ignorance and lack of professional skills. What is more, it is obvious that not all physicians were to be trusted in the absence of a proper qualification system for becoming a doctor. However Matsumura (1997), whilst basically agreeing with Kabayama's views, seems quite right to point out that we cannot evaluate the evolution of yojo in pre-modem society from the modem viewpoint of 'social medicine' or 'public health'.1 0 7 Yojo practice primarily aims at self-control and self-evolution. Yet Matsumura (1997) refers to Edo-period Confucian yojo texts that discuss practices for women, children and the old separately. The bodies of these socially \"weak and inferior\" people and their preservation are thereby brought under the surveillance of a patriarch who supposedly had yojo knowledge and had mastered the way of practice. In this sense the \"gaze\" of yojo turns towards others, beyond self-care. I would like to focus on this aspect as suggesting that the ideas of public health of later periods might already be found within the Edo-period yojo teachings. Generally speaking, public health tries to regulate individuals in the name of health policy and education. 1 0 6 Kabayama 1976, 460-463. 1 0 7 Matsumura 1997,116. 65 We usually tend to differentiate it from pre-modem yojo, regarding the former as having spread along with Western medicine after the Meiji Restoration (1867). There is no denying that public health and yojo are fundamentally different, but it still seems possible to point to a certain continuity between them in terms of the Intention to authorise others to perform this regulatory function. Furthermore we find that a number of health manuals and home medicine texts were published from the Meiji period onward. At first sight they are heavily indebted to Western physiology and science, but in fact modem and pre-modem ideas are interwoven in their contents. The rise of health manuals and home medicine texts is often associated with the notional diffusion of \"public health\" and \"individual or * 1 flR *national hygiene\". It is possible that the relation of demand and supply of medical knowledge can be traced to the popularity of yojo during the Edo period. In this sense, Bydka suchi , with its detailed instructions for health care in the home, embodies one of the important characteristics of yojo texts at the end of the Edo period, when the demand for home medicine reached a crescendo. 1-4. Conclusion of Chapter 1 To conclude Chapter 1, I have reviewed the intellectual background of cultivation of life culture in China and Japan. In relation to my overall aim, to reveal a pattern in the Japanese interpretation of a Chinese cultivating life tradition, the survey in this introductory chapter has uncovered certain differences between the two in general. Chinese yangsheng theory evolved out of the close relations among various ways of thought including Confucianism, Buddhism, Daoism, and ideas about 1 0 1998,43-81. 66 immortality. It is possible to delineate two basic principles: Firstly, it has as its basis the concept of qi, which is the stuff of all phenomena in the universe. The human body is also an accumulation of qi, thus yangsheng practices fundamentally set out to take, preserve, circulate, and refine qi within the body. In particular, the pathology of xu (depletion) accentuated the powerful fear of losing qi, Secondly, if we roughly generalise the ideas of yangsheng as \"how to look after one's life and health\" and \"how to live one's life\", there is a preoccupation in Chinese yangsheng with the desire to attain longevity and immortality. On the other hand, although having its ultimate origins in ancient China, yojo culture in Japan gradually detached itself from Chinese tradition in many ways. Especially during the Edo period, yojo theory became characterised by strong concern with \"how to live one's life\", rather than longevity and immortality. Yojo texts were diffused over a wider social spectrum than ever before, in conjunction with the development of publishing culture and mass education. Yojo practice extended beyond health-related activities such as dietetics, exercise and breath regulation, and reached into every area of life. In viewing all social activity as yojo practice, on the one hand yojo texts emphasise how one's present life in the world can be positively enriched. On the other hand they promote the idea that one should fit into the social framework and status distinctions of the times For the purposes of discussion in the following chapter, the expansion of the base of yojo practitioners during the Edo period has been noted, as the ordinary householder began to be seen as the main audience for yojo texts. Along with this change, the authors of yojo texts presumably became more concerned with ways of facilitating the understanding of Chinese medical tradition for the lay reader. In the second chapter, I will deal with Bydka suchi as my main text, and demonstrate how 67 the author, as a scholarly doctor, set out to interpret Chinese medical knowledge for the ordinary householder, with special attention to the unique writing method of Byoka suchi. 68 Chapter 2: Analysis of the texts This chapter offers an introduction to the annotated text Bydka suchi first presenting the life of its author Hirano Jusei ^ I f HIM and his representative works. Hirano Jusei lived from 1790 to 1867, a period of historical change that heralded the end of the Tokugawa regime (1867) and the coming of a new era that began with the Meiji Restoration (1868) - an era characterised by the opening-up of the nation and rapid Westernisation. Both his personal background and his awareness of the changing dynamics of contemporary society greatly affected many aspects of Hirano Jusei's life and work. Therefore an analysis of his texts needs to incorporate an understanding of various social, economic, and cultural factors. Secondly, it gives an account of the structure of Bydka suchi , which consists of eight fascicles # {kan\\ and of the content of each fascicle. Bydka suchi is the most extensive of Jusei's texts of home medicine and cultivation of life, and every fascicle concisely displays his views of the body, illnesses, and medical ethics. 2-1. The Life and Work of Hirano Jusei in Contemporary Society 2-1-1. Contemporary Society The early half of the nineteenth century, when Hirano Jusei was active, was characterised by social instability at a national level. By this time the capacity of the Tokugawa regime to deal with a succession of domestic and diplomatic issues had begun its final decline. First of all the country was in shock at encountering foreign nations (other than China, Korea, and the Netherlands) after adhering to an isolationist policy for over two hundred years. As the European nations and Russia 69 began to expand their territory in Asia, interaction with foreign countries became unavoidable; however the Tokugawa regime failed to manage the increasing unrest among the population. Turning to domestic problems, Japan experienced a succession of severe famines on a national scale. The death toll reached several millions in the 'famine of the Tempo era5 (1833-1837). Though the first five years were the worst, the famine as a whole lasted more than thirty years. Starvation resulted in the spread of epidemics among the weakened populace. The famine caused a huge leap in rice prices, which rose by five times and more, because the government and limited numbers of privileged rice-merchant guilds had cornered the market. Resentment among the people about this inflation and the lack of relief measures caused a phenomenal number of riots - nearly a thousand - all over Japan during the Tempo era (1830-1843). In urban areas around the country, the desperate and volatile poor attacked the rich to seize rice and money. In an attempt to solve these problems, the minister Mizuno Tadakuni yfcif H (1794-1851) initiated measures known as the Tempo Reform (1830-1843). His policy may be summed up as tightening official discipline, restoring moral health, and enforcing frugality, while mitigating the foreign policy situation. As a counter-measure to inflation, Mizuno dissolved the privileged guilds in the markets. Previously trade and prices had been controlled through government-authorised guilds, but in fact underground guilds had proliferated over the years. The idea was that free competition would reduce prices. However it resulted, rather, in confusion in the market because established channels for the distribution of commodities were lost. In the long run the top-down Tempo reforms withered away, and the minister was forced to resign. 70 Efforts at reform extended to the regional domains of feudal lords, but in many domains internal factionalism and the resistance of conservatives distracted reformers. On the other hand in several domains, in particular Choshu reformers succeeded to some extent in developing the fiscal economy and industry as well as in realigning administrative structures. They also fortified defences by forming farmer militias, importing guns, artillery and other weapons, and learning Western ballistics at the port of Nagasaki. In contrast to the waning central state, these fiefs grew in strength, and it was these that later became the centre of the movement to overthrow the Tokugawa regime. In July 1853, Commodore Matthew Perry entered the harbour at Uraga Bay near Edo city with four black ships of the US Navy, and demanded the opening of Japanese ports and the beginning of diplomatic relations with Japan. Rather than risking war, in 1854 the Tokugawa government finally consented to sign the Kanagawa Treaty with the United States. However political and economic disorder persisted, and finally the fifteenth successor of the Tokugawa regime, Yoshinobu \u00ae J i l l ! # (ruled 1866-1867), resigned as shogun in 1867. This marked the end of the Edo period. The intrusion of foreign powers may have prompted the overthrow of the regime, but long before this, domestic circumstances had created the tensions that would lead to drastic change. With reference to yojo culture, Kabayama (1978) maintains that the famines of the early nineteenth century called forth new features in Edo-period culture. He poses the question: how did people incorporate the onslaught of natural disaster into their 71 own experience?1 We find two types of writing that reflect the experience of famine: documentary records and self-help texts. The latter are often categorised as yojo writings. Most of them are simple and practical in character. The typical contents may be summed up as (1) a general history of famine since antiquity, (2) th6 signs of famine, (3) detailed records of recent famines, i.e. Horeki Tenmei and Temp5 (4) lists of emergency foods and cooking recipes, and (5) first aid. Publications in this genre peaked in the first half of the nineteenth century, when demand for practical knowledge for survival increased among villagers and fanners. People were also aware that they could not expect help from anyone other than themselves, due to the lack of public aid. This attitude is intertwined with the rise of yojo theory. There was an intellectual concern with the way one led one's personal daily life, and along with that, a determination to seek out knowledge and also to apply it within one's social life. This broad knowledge and body of theory was communicated extensively and lastingly. Moreover these cultural factors did not end with the Tempo era, but persisted from the end of the Edo period into the modem era. They are claimed to be both a driving force and a constituent part in the formation of citizens' culture in Japan.2 We know that Hirano Jusei also wrote such texts as Tama no uduchi 3\u00a305P$\u00ae. (A jewel hammer, 1837), which provides instruction in how to cope with epidemics after a famine, first aid in warfare and how to refine saltpetre for military purposes. Kabayama's analysis seems to confirm that Hirano's works also reflect the 1 Kabayama Koichi 1978, 'Kikin in Hayashiya, 389-420. 2 Kabayama 1978, 410. 72 intellectual demands of the late Edo period and that they epitomise the characteristics of yojo texts in the prelude to the modem era. 2-1-2. Life and work Hitherto little has been known of the personal background of Hirano Jusei. Nor do we know how popular or widely known Bydka suchi was in its time. According to Kokusho somokuroku, 23 copies of the Edo-period edition are extant today.3 There are several recent studies which refer to Hirano Jusei (or Bydka suchi), usually in not more than a few sentences, as either an obstetrician or a yojo writer. In a general history of medicine in the Edo period, Hirano Jusei is mentioned as an obstetrician who wrote a text addressed to midwives, Zaba hikken (What a midwife must study, 1830), which consists of the seventh and eighth fascicles of Bydka suchi.4 Among his yojo texts, probably Yojoketsu (A way of cultivating life, 1835) is better known than Bydka suchi, as it is contained in Eisei bunko (The collected writings of cultivating life, 1917).5 Both Yojoketsu and Bydka suchi discuss breath-regulation, and some scholars hold that Hirano's method is connected with Zen meditation.6 Takizawa (2001) also mentions Tama no uzuchi EECDjPlii as an example of famine literature, which shows how people regarded such natural disasters and how they managed to incorporate them into their own experience,7 As for references to Byoka suchi, there is one illustration 3 Kokusho somokuroku hoteiban , vol. 6, 829. No record is found in the Daisobon mokuroku ~ k . i which contains a list of many popular medical texts and yojo texts of the Edo period. Kyoto University library (ed) 1988-1989, Daisobon mokuroku (Kyoto University library, Kyoto) vol. Eisei 3:143-184. 6 Takizawa 1998, Tanaka 1996, Kenkoho to iyashi no shakaishi (Seikyusha, Tokyo), 51-52 and 91. 7 Takizawa 2001,74-77. 73 that is a favourite with scholars because of its uniqueness. It shows a sleeping cure that makes use of the sound of water dripping close to the patient's bedside (discussed in chapter 3-7 of the thesis, section on \"Discussion of what the person engaged in nursing should bear in mind\").8 On the other hand, it is noteworthy that Bydka suchi has recently been examined in the field of the history of nursing as a text of home medicine. For instance Tatsukawa (2001) points out that Bydka suchi sets great store by nursing and care by the patient's family.9 A research group of medical professionals (Hasegawa, Ito and Matsumura, 1999) has also compared early nineteenth-century nursing texts from Japan and Britain, using Bydka suchi and Tassei zusetsu (Illustration of achieving life, by Kondo Naoyoshi ifrlSDlCil, 1858) as Japanese examples alongside Notes on Nursing: What It Is and What It Is Not (Florence Nightingale, 1859).1 0 In addition there is an ongoing group research project, mainly consisting of nurses, who have been studying Byoka suchi and Hirano Jusei as a pioneer in the history of nursing in Japan.1 1 They tend to emphasise that the teachings of Bydka suchi and modem nursing have much in common, particularly in the strong emphasis they place on the necessity for careful nursing at home. Despite the fact that Bydka suchi is based on the Confucian morality of filial piety and traditional medical concepts, there is little difference in the concern for sick persons and their families. These studies by medical professionals seem to approach the text from the viewpoint of progressivism in medicine and universal humanity. sTatsukawa Shoji 2001, Yojdkun 5. 9 2001,178-183. 1 0 Hasegawa Aiko, 1 1 I joined the research group in 2004, and would like to express my gratitude to Dr Sakamoto Hiroko, Dr Hirao Machiko, and Dr Nakamura Setsuko, who are the leading figures in this investigation. 74 As for systematic investigations concerning Hirano Jusei, thus far two recent studies are available, which contribute to our knowledge of his life and works. Firstly, Anzai (1975) provided an introduction to all of Hirano Jusei's extant works and examined his medical theories in his annotated edition of Ihd kekku Secondly, Nakamura (2004) traced Hirano's descendants and charted his family tree using records of his ancestors (Sendaiki 5 fcftlS ).1 3 This discovery has revealed a great deal about unknown parts of the Hirano lineage.1 4 Hirano Jusei was bom in 1790, practised medicine as a private town doctor in the city of Edo, and died on 16th November 1867 at the age of seventy-eight. His family were originally from Ise present-day Mie H U , where they belonged to the lower samurai class. Jusei's grandfather Juei (d. 1797) moved at the age of twelve to the city of Edo, where he first worked as an apprentice at a large merchant house. An anecdote relates Juei's reasons for becoming a doctor: One day when he was sent to deliver goods to a samurai's mansion, one of the retainers there said that Juei was in his way, and threw him out. Feeling very indignant, Juei thought that as long as he was a merchant, this could happen again. He sought about for a different profession so that he would not be despised by the samurai class, and decided to take up medicine. Since he was a stranger in the city of Edo and did not have any connection with medical circles, he could not become an apprentice to another physician. Thus it took him many years to master medicine, studying by himself from books at night while he worked for a shop in the daytime. In this way Juei became a physician, and his son Juryo S H : 1 2 Ihd kekku annotation: 1-14. 1 3 These manuscripts are currently in the possession of Hirano Shizuo a direct descendant of Hirano Jusei. succeeded him in the profession. Jusei was the eldest son of three brothers, all of whom became physicians. This episode illustrates two aspects of the medical culture of that time. Firstly the practice of medicine was already established as a profession, and comifianded a certain respect in society. Secondly there were three ways of transmitting medical knowledge at the time: the master-disciple relationship, learning from written texts, and hereditary transmission. Because there was no official qualification or registration system to regulate physicians, it was possible to call oneself a physician as long as one could treat patients and was recognized by others as a professional. Choosing to continue in the family business as a hereditary physician, Jusei probably first learned the basics of medicine from his father. Jusei's father Juryo had become acquainted with Sugita Genpaku ^ 03 S S (1733-1817), a renowned physician, and had also learned pharmacology from Taki Motoyasu (1755-1810), one of the leaders of Koiho (Classic School). These medical associates of his father presumably had a certain influence on Jusei's medical education, and it was probably through these connections that Jusei himself in his youth became a pupil of Taki Motoyasu. Here we need to briefly review the intellectual background of medicine in the Edo period. In the era preceding the Edo period, called the Azuchi-Momoyama S i $fc[i| period (1569-1600), a new school of medicine appeared, namely Gosei-ha %. or Ryuiho \u00a7 l!j (Modem School or Medicine Liu1 5 ). Its founder, Manase Dosan ft (1507-1594), was the leading figure in the medicine of that period. Their medical practice is said to have been strongly influenced by the 1 5 \"Medicine of Liu\" indicates that their theory and practice follow the medicine of Liu Wansu (1120-1200) of the Jin dynasty, who attributes the causality of most diseases to the concept of \"fire\". 76 teachings of Li Dongyuan (or Li Gao and Zhu Danqi (or Zhu Zhenheng ^ H t 3 ? ) in Yuan China (1271-1368). In line with this* they emphasised the incorporation of neo-Confucianism into medical practice, in opposition to the dominance of Buddhism up to that time. Their medicine has as its theoretical basis \"the unification of the Heaven and men \u2014\", a tenet of neo-Confucianism, particularly the variety of Zhu Xi Given this influence from a rather complex philosophy, the medicine of the Modem School tends to be complicated and abstract with a strong attachment to Five Phases and yin yang theory. Taking a broader view of the history of medicine in Japan, scholars such as Fujikawa (1952) and Otsuka (1996) consider that another faction, the Classic School, emerged as the antithesis of the Modem School in the middle of the Edo period.1 7 Criticising the abstraction of the Modem School, the adherents of the Classic School are known for their advocacy of empiricism and clinical experience. Moreover they are often characterised by a particular attachment to Shanghanlun (The treatise on cold damage) by Zhang Zhongjing 'jlj'f'jp; of the Later Han dynasty, and their insistence on a return to what they viewed as the \"true\" medical classics. It is difficult to summarise the medicine of this school, because different practitioners advocated different medical texts as their preferred authority and established their own styles of medicine. It seems true that Shanghanlun and Jinguiyaolue (Medical treasures in the golden casket) by Zhang Zhongjing were always key texts for Japanese physicians, but they saw a big leap in popularity from the middle to the end of the Edo period. This is clear from the large number of reprints issued in Japan, including annotated texts. Mayanagi (1997) demonstrates that there were fifteen reprints of Shanghanlun , which was the third highest among all the reprints of 1 6 Fujikawa 1952,185-193, and Otsuka Keisetsu rekishi (Iwanami, 103-105. 77 Chinese medical texts throughout the Edo period; and ten out of those fifteen were issued between 1781 and 1870. Jinguiyaolue was reprinted fourteen times, the fourth highest of all, and seven out of the fourteen reprints were likewise issued between 1781 and 1870.1 8 Many prominent doctors emerged from the Classic School. Among them are Goto Konzan |_ L | (1659-1733), who claimed that all illnesses occur from the stagnation of ki in the body (Ikki ryutai setsu \u2014 a n d Yoshimasu Todo pf (1702-1773), who established a theory that all diseases can be attributed to one kind of poison (Manbyd ichidoku setsu t&)1 9 . Some incorporated Western medicine into traditional medicine, while Kagawa Shuan aimed at the unification of Confucianism and medicine and established a unique medical ontheory of his own. On the other hand there was Western medicine, initially introduced by Jesuit missionaries in the sixteenth century, mainly from Spain and Portugal. This was the medicine followed by the Komoryu (literally \"Red-headed School\"), a school of surgery. Later on, Japanese practitioners who learned Western medicine were called Rampo (literally \"Dutch remedies\"), and they are usually regarded 1 8 Mayanagi 1997, 324-328. 1 9 The theory of Manbyd ichidoku (one poison for all diseases). Yoshimasu was one of the leading physicians of the Classic School. Quoting the famous statement \"flowing water does not become putrid and the hinges of a door are not devoured by bugs. This is because they are in motion \u00bb F'fti'FIIL Sb-til\" from Lushi chimqiu , Yoshimasu extends this to build up a pathology that views ki as the fluid flowing within the human body, which is always in holistic correlation with the universe. Thus stagnation creates poisons, which manifest as various diseases depending on the parts of the body involved and on one's condition. His texts such as Idan (1759) and Iji wakumon (1769) caused much controversy chunqiu (Mr Lti's spring and autumn), Zhou, 3rd century BCE. In Sibu Congkan H IT lJ . Originally published in 1919-1922.

Hereafter abbreviated as edition, 'zibu -f-pfP', zhi ij ff e 4, ' jinshu 2 0 Otsuka 1996, 25-29, 2 1 nitsuite', Yamadaand specialised in surgery,2 2 Yamawaki Toyo |lj J $ & M W is known for performing the first dissection in Japan in 1754. Later the anatomical text Ontleedkundige Tafelen (1734), the Dutch version of Anatomische Tabellen (originally in German, by Johann Adam Kulmus), jointly by Sugita Ryotaku ftj and published as Kaitai Shinsho (Anew text of dissection) in 1774. Apart from these schools, many other medical groups co-existed during the Edo period, and their relations were sometimes competitive, sometimes cooperative, but never quite mutually exclusive. There was a good deal of cross-fertilisation of ideas between different types of medicine. For instance, there was also Setchu-ha (the Eclectic School), which followed Classic medicine and Shanghanlun as its main doctrine and methods, complemented by elements of Western medicine,2 3 This picture of three medical trends in Japan from the end of the sixteenth century onward has been broadly accepted up till now. However, in recent years historians have begun to question this factionalist view. For instance, Ishida (1997) re-examines what exactly the Modem School involved, paying particularly attention to how they it drew on Chinese medical culture.2 4 Like many other physicians of the time, Hirano Jusei sought out theories and practices from a broad range of medical texts by both Chinese and Japanese authors. It is difficult to categorise to which medical school Jusei belongs, especially since the definitions involved are by no means clear-cut. But it is evident that Jusei especially inclined towards Shanghanlun as the principle of his medicine, declaring: \"In treating illnesses, if one follows the rules of Shanghanlun , there should be no 2 2 Sugimoto no Orandaryu Konzan, Toyo as Yasuchika 1981, Nihon jui kenkyu (Godo 79 error\"25. After the Jin and Tang dynasties, medicine deteriorated, and became mixed up with Daoism. Complexities were introduced into the theory of yinyang \"and Five Phases, and after the Song and Yuan, the art of medicine simply became worse, no match for ancient times. Although a large number of medical texts appeared, there is nothing that is worth looking at.2 6 While practising medicine on the one hand, he began his career as a writer at the age of forty and left more than twenty titles by his authorship. Bydka suchi was his first published work. At some point (the exact date is unknown), Hirano Jusei lost the sight of one eye after being accidentally stabbed by one of his children who was playing with a metal chopstick for handling charcoal. He prided himself on writing a considerable number of works despite this disability, and also on writing in small, fine characters, which can be seen in many of the facsimile copies of his works available nowadays. In his writings, he used many nicknames and pennames in addition to his given name Jusei: Kohan rojin A, Shiko Seishi J C , Mokuo ffSil, and so on. Beside this, he sometimes designated himself by his dwelling place, adopting such soubriquets as Takuzenkyo Senshin'an and Muteki'an These names already appear to suggest the reason why Jusei left so little record about himself. The title which he favoured, Dojin ill A (literally, a man of the Way), seems to imply a 2 5 Ihd kekku, 11. 2 6 Iho kekku , 3. 80 wish to lead a reclusive life, and Muteki an expression from Lunyu, indicates the way of the sage as neither \"reconciled to the world\", nor \"without attachment to it\"27. No doubt Jiisei's oeuvre embodies volatile internal dynamics, and the Zeitgeist of the early half of the nineteenth century. After Byoka suchi , he wrote several works revealing his broad interests and positions, which are presented in detail and surveyed by Anzai (1975).2 8 Based on Anzai's investigation, I will divide them into five types: home medicine, medical ethics, diagnosis and prescription, texts with a military connection, and Japanese history. (1) Home medicine: Bydka suchi for the uses of Ydjd yoryaku (Digest of cultivating life), Shimin yojodan (Talk of cultivating life for all people), Shohyd yojodan (Talk of cultivating life with various diseases), Suiryo zokuben (Popular talk of the water cure), Kisai bigen (Subtle talk of all aid). These texts of cultivation of life and home medicine show the author's belief in the need to disseminate basic medical knowledge and knowledge of self care among the public, which is characteristic of the period. From their titles, Yojo yoryaku , Shimin yojodan , and Shoybo yojodan can be presumed to deal with cultivation of life, but the texts are no longer extant. Suiryo zokuben and Kisai bigent which are mentioned in Byoka suchi and Ihd kekku as texts on water cures are also lost to us today. Tama no Uzuchi 3E (A jewel hammer, 1837) gives vital information for times of famine: which 2 7 The original text states Lunyu, 81 plants are edible, how to eat them, and which diseases and epidemics are likely to occur. The number of texts from the Edo period that deal with measures for coping with famine bears witness to the succession of famines and the difficult food situation2 9, even while a rich food culture was developing in urban areas. 'Tama no Uzuchi was also most probably a response to the Tempo famine, which was still in course. (2) Medical ethics: Kakukei ihen (Kakukei's medical stone needle, 1854) BOS' (A night's tale of medicine, 1866). These works demonstrate Jusei's desire to correct errors in contemporary medical trends, such as the danger of studying the medicine of only one particular faction, the deterioration of morality among physicians, adherence to conventions unsupported by clinical experience, and the uncritical advocacy of Western studies. (3) Diagnosis and prescription: Ihd kekku (Examination of the way of making prescriptions, 1843-1848), Seiseihosen zokuben ^ ill # (Popular talk of selected prescriptions, 1848 draft), Bydi bengi (Treatise on disease loci, 1849 on pulse diagnosis, diagnosis, 1857) and Ufa shokan zatsubyoron zokuben (Popular songs of cold damage and various diseases). In the first of these, Ihd kekku , the author selects more than 100 important prescriptions from Shanghanlun and Jingui yaoliie and examines their credibility based on his own clinical experience and views. Jusei's predilection for Zhang Zhongjing is very evident. Bydi bengi discusses the loci of diseases of the three yin and three yang. The content of Shinmyaku bengi overlaps 19 *Five of the famines that took place in the Edo period are especially notorious for their scale and seriousness: Bydi bengi zokuben kekku. Uta shokan zatsubyoron zokuben facilitates the understanding of the medical theory of Shanghanlun by providing a short poem which concisely summarises the concept of each section that follows. (4) Texts with a military connection: Kyukyii tekiho (The way of first-aid, Kyukyii setsuyoho (Essentials of first-aid, 1857). The need for military medicine reflects a sequence of interactions with foreign nations and a situation of domestic unrest. In addition to describing practical first aid for warfare, Jusei laments how idle and degenerate the samurai class has have become during two hundred years of peace, an increasingly alarming situation which arouses his patriotism. Shdseki seirenho ^ H (Way of refining nitre) explains how to refine nitre in a home workshop and how to prepare gunpowder. Kyuba shinron (A new theory of stabling horses, 1854) deals with such matters as equine diseases and how to keep war-horses at low cost. (5) National history: Kokoku kaibyaku yuraiki (The record of national origins since the beginning, 1860) and Tenjitsushi ben 5c 0 (Discussion of the successor of the sun, 1854). These texts show Jusei's strongly-held belief that the Japanese should be proud of their long national history, which can be traced back to antiquity. At the end of the Edo period, the slogan Sonno (Reverence for the Emperor) began to circulate. It originated in the absolute loyalty felt toward the Emperor, and at the same time, it implied less loyalty, or actual resistance, to the ruling Tokugawa regime. The slogan was employed especially in the domains of Choshu and Satsuma, where the rebel movement to overthrow the Tokugawa regime was particularly active. It may be 83 possible that Hirano was influenced by such a trend, judging from his emphasis on orthodoxy and legitimacy in national history and the Emperor's lineage. There are several themes that recur repeatedly in his texts: the significance of clinical experience and experimentation, the value of the utterances and precepts of ancient sages, and a belief in the orthodoxy of the Japanese national historical lineage. Frequent quotations from the classics may reflect his background in the Classic School; and his emphasis on the verification of contemporary and past theories suggests the influence of his medical master, Taki Motoyasu, who was known for pursuing the verification of ancient medicine. On the other hand, an emphasis on \"Japanese-ness\" is to be found dispersed throughout his writings, in relation to such matters as the tradition of abstinence from meat, differences from China in prescribing medicines, and scepticism about Western learning. Regarding Western medicine, Hirano partly admits its theories and practices to be reasonable and highly developed, but is dubious about the way that some of his Japanese contemporaries blindly adhere to it based on a mere smattering of knowledge3 0 . 2-1-3. The structure of Bydka suchi Bydka suchi consists of eight fascicles, covering a broad range of subjects. As the title indicates, it discusses home medicine: things that any household with a sick person in it (bydka 'MW-) should know (suchi This is also evident from another Japanese furigana reading for found in the preface: \"Bydka kokoroe gusa \".3 1 This in turn can also can be written meaning \"essential information for households with sick family members\". As well as daily regimen, the text plainly sets forth principles of dietetics, pathology, nursing, child 3 0 Ihd kekku, preface. 3 1 BS 1:5. 84 rearing, first aid, midwifery and so on. The first fascicle begins with an outline of the contents and the author's motivation for writing. He was prompted to publish this text of home medicine by the desire to save people from incompetent or misguided physicians and the poor medical conditions prevailing especially in rural areas. Furigana (phonetic readings) are appended to almost every Chinese character, showing the author's desire that the text should also be read out to illiterate people. The next part discusses daily regimen, followed by instructions for family members of the sick, such as warnings against the misuse of drugs by non-professionals, how to choose and deal with physicians, why diseases are infectious and how to nurse the sick in the family setting. It briefly sets forth Hirano Jusei's views of basic care, physiology, pathology, and medical ethics. There are three essential attributes for the cultivation of life iyojo), namely the traditional Confucian virtues of diligence, frugality and fear of Heaven's decree. Regulating form (the body) through habitual exercise also has the effect of cultivating the mind. The significance of digestion (konare) for the body is bound up with the fear of stagnation, which is caused by any kind of excess. Such keywords as \"frugality\", \"habitual form\" and \"circulation\" re-echo in late Edo-period yojo teaching. In particular, circulation and stagnation make up the core of physiology and pathology. Not only do excessive eating and sleeping disturb abdominal circulation, but excessive emotion too may form a congelation in the abdomen and result in various mental and physical disorders. The author's medical ethics are apparent from the typical errors he points out in both physician and patient. On the one hand, physicians have a tendency to run after wealth and fame, and to resort to sophistry to deceive gullible lay people. On the other hand, patients often do not trust physicians and force the responsibility for care 85 on to their families. Regretting the fact that such behaviour gravely undermines the relationship between the two, Jusei demands amendment equally of both sides. On the care of the sick, Byoka suchi distinguishes itself from other texts by highlighting the crucial importance of nursing at home. The duties of a household meniber may be summed up in three points. Firstly, one should aim to prevent illness when there is no sign of it yet. Secondly, when illness has already occurred, one should reflect on the cause and send promptly for an appropriate physician. Thirdly, in serious or hopeless cases, one should carefully observe every aspect of the sick person's condition from physical symptoms to mental state. In addition to the roles of the physician and patient and the relationship between them, the text clearly highlights the third role in clinical practice: that of the family members who do the nursing. The second fascicle deals with dietetics, accounting for the beneficial and harmful effects of foodstuffs. Instruction is addressed to three types of people: those engaged in the daily pursuit of cultivation of life, those who are sick, and those who take care of the sick. Stress is laid on restraining oneself from excessive eating and the importance of habitual diet. Although a number of everyday foodstuffs are listed with comments, such as for which illness they are effective or to be avoided, the author does not wish the reader to be overly concerned with categories and rules. Nor does he employ the yinyang doctrine or the Five Phases theory to classify foods as many contemporary physicians did, but rather he relies on his experience. If the sick person eats to excess, or is forced to eat something that he or she is not used to because it is regarded as having medicinal properties, it will cause stagnation and obstruct circulation in the abdomen. As long as it is digestible, any food can be taken, because a patient's favourite food stimulates the natural power of the body and helps it to recover. For Jusei, nothing is more vital for a sick person than to strengthen the 86 \"healing power of nature\" that comes from within. Thus food is essentially evaluated according to whether it can assist that power or impede it, rather than food itself being seen as medicine. The third fascicle covers instructions on child-rearing for expectant mothers and those with young children, the responsibility of wet-nurses, and what precautions to take regarding children's illnesses. Children should not be fed too much or clothed too heavily. As with grown-ups, excessive eating inhibits good digestion, and heavy clothing opens the pores of the skin to the invasion of illness from outside. It is also important for mothers to breast-feed their children. While breast milk is nourishing, it may also transmit the characteristics of the wet-nurse to the infant. Sometimes, breast milk transmits illness-causing poisons from the mother or wet-nurse as well as efficacious medicine. In case of employing a wet-nurse, therefore, one needs to make careful observations, taking into consideration her age, appearance, constitution, and background as well as other characteristics. A wet-nurse should also carry out yojo practice herself, for she affects every aspect of the children. Since most wet-nurses are lowly people, they should be kept busy working, for laziness decreases the quantity and quality of breast-milk. Here the author differentiates appropriate yojo practice for the lowly wet-nurse from that of the reader who employs her. For the former, labour itself amounts to pursuing the way of yojo, while for the latter, practices like breath-regulation and massage, as described in the first fascicle, need to be taught. Class distinction in the nature of practice is one of the specific features of Edo-period yojo culture. Most children's illnesses are to be attributed to inherent toxins from the parents. Sometimes the poison is transmitted through breast milk; therefore it is the mother or wet-nurse who should take medication first. Smallpox is regarded as unavoidable for 87 most children. This disease is also attributed to toxins inherited from the parents, and poxes are the outcome of the natural healing power of the body getting rid of the poison. Applying the pathology of poisons, the author opposes the traditional ways of thinking that attributes most children's illnesses to \"the worm\" H (mushi). He further criticises the quasi-superstitious habits surrounding the prevention and treatment of smallpox.3 2 The fourth fascicle discusses women's health. It is possible to say that the concept of kuse # (habit to the point of obstinacy) epitomises the pathology of women's illnesses. The author claims that most women's illnesses occur due to their nature, which is narrow-minded, stubborn, emotional, self-centred, and suspicious. Women often get chronic diseases that are caused by pent-up negative emotion and worries, or long-established unwise habits. Therefore the crux of women's yojo lies in keeping calm and tranquil and in carrying out their duties and massage exercise. The text then continues with a discussion aimed at expectant mothers and their families of what to bear in mind during pregnancy and labour, from daily regimen to prenatal influences, morning sickness, and effective abdominal massage. Sexual intercourse during pregnancy should be restricted, for sexual lust not only affects a child's characteristics but also forms transmittable poisons, causing smallpox and other diseases in the baby. In addition methods of treating acute symptoms that occur before and after delivery are described with the aid of illustrations, including epilepsy, discomfort from constipation, sudden fainting, convulsions, and uterine bleeding. In these cases, Jusei writes, one often finds a congealed lump in the pit of the stomach thrusting up towards the woman's chest. She can often be saved by pressing it down hard with one's fist. In addition, various customs relating to 3 2 Pathology, treatments and folk beliefs regarding smallpox in Chinese tradition are best referenced by Chang Chia-feng 1996, Aspects of smallpox and its significance in Chinese history (Ph.D. Thesis submitted to University of London, School and African Studies). 88 childbirth are criticised as going against nature, such as the use of the abdominal sash and birthing chair and the hasty removal of the afterbirth. The fifth fascicle explores the principles of contagious diseases and seasonal colds and fevers, including syphilis, venereal scabies, cold damage disorders, epidemics, diarrhoea, and beriberi. Unlike smallpox and measles, where transmission is mediated by the air, venereal diseases are transmitted by tactile contact, most typically sexual intercourse. The seed of the poison invades the body, where it lies dormant for a long period and becomes assimilated with the blood and flesh, and it may manifest as any one of several diseases, not only syphilis. The most effective cure, therefore, is to expel the poison by means of the vital energy of the body, so that it is removed with the urine or in bodily fluids via the skin. One contracts cold damage disorders when the skin is affected by cold air, allowing disease poisons to invade the body. Discharge of excessive yang qi through the pores of the skin, i.e., perspiration, is again the key to treatment. From venereal diseases to cold damage disorders, the treatments and pathology described in this fascicle axe based on the most fundamental principle of medicine, \"to reduce what is excessive and to supplement what is insufficient (sun youyu bu buzu Real treatment consists in harnessing the natural healing power of the sick person's body, that is, making the innate vital energy perform its function of removing disease poisons. It is also concerned with the balance between yin and yang, for poison is hot (i.e. yang) in nature. Although identifying and balancing the relations between yin and yang is difficult for lay people, the water cure often shows miraculous efficacy, particularly for cold damage disorders. However the author avoids giving a detailed 3 3 The formula is first found in Laozi. Laozi daodezhenjing attributed to Laozi, thought to have been composed around 250 BCE. Annotated by Wang Bi 3E3\u00ae (226-249). Reprint 1985 (Zhonghua shuju, Beijing), Chapter 77,1055-182. 89 explanation of the principle of the water cure, saying that it is discussed in Suiryo zokuben a text that is no longer extant today. The sixth fascicle expounds the causes and treatment of acute symptoms. It discusses shokusho M (food damage) and kakuran H i\u00a7 L (vomiting and diarrhoea), both of which are characterised by severe vomiting and diarrhoea. Although both are attributed to inordinate eating, in shokusho this is mostly, and in kakuran always, combined with an attack by evil external ki. Therefore treatment aims primarily to warm up the body and thereby induce natural vomiting and diarrhoea to remove the poison. Next the text deals with food poisoning and detoxification, followed by various acute illnesses: lethargy, apoplexy, sudden unconsciousness, convulsion, dizziness, nightmares and insomnia, epilepsy, madness, stiff shoulders, nosebleeds, vomiting blood, prolapse of the anus, tapeworm, motion sickness, bums, choking, dog bites (rabies), snake and insect bites, and rodent bites. In order to guard against sudden death, the author explains how to provide first aid, using ordinary materials and homely medicines, dietetics, bloodletting, water cures, and pressure or massage. The latter half of the fascicle is devoted to showing how to treat bmises, cuts and dislocations, including washing the affected area, making ointments, applying dressings and bone setting (Illustration 1, 2). 90 f.fV'**** \u00bb #* * * * * * n 4 - v < M ifC ' 4 * \u00a9 H |\u00bb r O .\u00bb t J * V '* 4 ^ |\u00a3 ^ V h T ij K > + * \u00bb * J < S - * < ; c^- f \u00bb tr . .' * \u00bb<flvTFe - * J w * * - i ^ < 0 K 'ife-W -^ w r*wM^jic V & \u00bb ^ \\ * \u00a5 ( 9 < * ^ , Illustration 1: Dressing (BS 6:42) * * P i W *,^s'*3^ ^ ^\u00bbe 04 VMI t\\ p V l V * ^ V * * + - > * \u00bb tlf 0 r? $ . fu \u2014 <\\ G < 0$\u00a7\"f- ( '\u00ab **^ O* * ' X.

Hirano Jusei defines kan very broadly as all symptoms related to the mind, and kan often appears as both cause and result of various illnesses. This is because pent-up or excessive emotion turns into kan, and kan in the long run often forms a congealed clump in the abdomen and causes stiffness throughout the body. The seventh and eighth fascicles originally made up an independent volume, Zaba hikken (What a midwife must study), which, unlike the preceding six fascicles, was not initially intended for lay people. Hirano wrote Zaba hikken in order to instruct midwives and women living in areas where medical aid was hard to 92 come by. These two fascicles differ from the preceding six mainly in two points. Firstly, the author uses far fewer Chinese characters to maximise intelligibility, on the assumption that most midwives were uneducated. Secondly, they consist of very practical and detailed accounts of delivery methods addressed to professionals, whereas the other six fascicles always deal in simple explanations and handy remedies suitable for lay people, omitting any complicated theory. The actual names of internal organs are also given, and their physiological functions are described and differentiated. The implication is that midwifery requires both expert knowledge of the human body and a high level of specialist skills, involving as it does the lives of both mother and infant. Jusei was anxious to enlighten midwives who were often not only \"illiterate\" but also \"stubborn and self-centred\"3 4 . These fascicles of midwifery begin with general information about pregnancy and childbirth, including how to distinguish the shape of the uterus, the placenta, presentation of the foetus, how to determine pregnancy, and the pros and cons of the abdominal sash3 s and the birthing chair36. Then come descriptions and illustrations of practical techniques for dealing with complicated cases, including how to correct the transverse position of the foetus, how to feel the uterus, how to allow mothers to give birth safely, and how to deliver the afterbirth (Illustration 3). In addition the text describes in greater details than in fascicle four the treatment of conditions that may 3 4 BS 1:6. 3 5 In Bydka suchi the term for the abdominal sash is written or (hara obi). It is an old custom in Japan that pregnant women in the fifth month tie a white cloth of approximately 2.4 meters around the abdomen. It has a ritual meaning of expressing the wish for an easy delivery. Kagawa Gen'etsu criticises this custom as harmful , however, takes a compromise stance: Attempting to eradicate the custom by force will do no good, so it is recommended that the mother should just tie it loosely, for the sake of her peace of mind. The text partly admits the possibility that if the sash is tied loosely and properly, it may sometimes correct the position of the foetus (BS 4:6-7, 7:15-21). 3 6 During the Edo period, women generally gave birth in a sitting position. The seated woman was supported during labour by either a rope hanging from the ceiling or a helper. However Kagawa Gen'etsu pointed out the harm that could be caused by the birthing chair in his Sanron (34-35), which seems to have influenced Hirano Jusei. 93 occur before or after childbirth: morning sickness, constipation, tetanus, eclampsia, haemorrhaging, and dizziness. The last part demonstrates how to save both mother and foetus in a difficult delivery by examining every possible case. It covers how to turn the baby to a headfirst position, what to do when the arms or the legs of the foetus are bom first, and how to correct a transverse lie. 94 , e ^ t f > t < w i\u00ae 'C ^ j-i--o Illustration 3: How to correct a transverse position of the foetus (BS 8:34) In his approach to childbirth, Hirano seems to have been influenced by the teaching of the Kagawa School of obstetrics |I!J This school was widely known for two famous obstetric texts, Sanron /Hfra (Treatise 1775) by Kagawa Genteki (1739-1779).3 7 It is not known whether Hirano learned obstetrics at first hand from the Kagawa School or just studied their texts. However, the mention of an obstetric hook which was invented by Kagawa Gen'etsu, and Hirano's disapproval of using the birthing chair as well as his criticism of conventional obstetric methods suggest a certain impact from their teaching. More importantly, Hirano shares the same view as the Kagawa School about the need in childbirth for management by an obstetrician or a professional midwife. During the Edo period, for the vast majority of women, childbirth did not involve medical professionals. Expectant mothers sent for a physician or a professional midwife only in case of a difficult delivery. In ordinary cases, experienced women from the neighbourhood were usually called on to assist. It was the Kagawa School that first asserted that the active intervention of physicians or properly trained midwives would allow the lives of more mothers and infants to be saved. This is why, after the diffusion of Western medicine in the Meiji era, the Kagawa School came to be regarded as the foundation of modem obstetrics in Japan.3 8 Sharing the same 3 7 Terazawa examines the historical background of the Kagawa obstetrics school and childbirth during the Edo period. Terazawa Yuki 2001, Gender, knowledge, and Power: Reproductive Medicine in Japan 1790-1930 (Ph.D. Thesis submitted to University of California, Los Angeles), 139-194. 3 8 The Kagawa school also proclaimed the superiority of medical obstetrics to midwifery, and its proponents regarded the foetus as a living soul, differing on both points from the conventional view of the Edo period. Kanazu Hidemi 1997 'Nihon Tokyo) 184-185. 96 indignation as the Kagawa School, the seventh and eighth fascicles of Bydka suchi (Zaba hikken) set out to equip both expectant mothers and midwives with proper knowledge and techniques for childbirth. The texts are written in simple kana script, standing in contrast to the Kagawa School's Sanron and Sanron ' yoku , both written completely in Chinese characters. In light of this, it is possible to evaluate Bydka suchi1 s seventh and eighth fascicles for their contribution to obstetrics and midwifery in Japan. 2-2. Reading Bydka suchi: the writing system Any thorough reading of a text out of the past of one's own language and literature is a manifold act of interpretation. In the great majority of cases, this act is hardly performed or even consciously recognised.3 9 2-2-1. Furigana : conceptual translation I will begin this section by reviewing some special features of the Japanese writing system; for the intensive exploitation of these features is arguably the most outstanding characteristic of Hirano's work. Most Japanese writing in the Edo period, and indeed today, employs two kinds of script: kanji and kana , that is, Chinese characters and a phonetic syllabary. Usually, a given word is represented by either a character or by a phonetic kana , but sometimes a word is rendered by a combination of the two. The kana is written alongside the Chinese character (or above it, in the case of modem horizontally printed texts) to indicate how it should be read. Such kana are known as furigana , 3 9 George Steiner 1975, After Babel: Aspects o f Language and Translation (Oxford University Press, Oxford, third edition, 1998), 20. 97 and one of their most common uses is to teach children whose knowledge of characters is limited, and to assist the average reader with rare and difficult characters. But this is not their only use. Furigana are also used daily in the filling out of any forms requiring the writing of a person's name and address (Figure 1). y U ( furigana'. read i ng) \u00a3 $ 1 name (Chinese characters)surname iJ L lB B*\u00a3 given name Address 1 - 2 - 3 % \u00a3 \u00a7 Tel: 0 3 (1 2 3 4) 5 6 7 8 Figure 1 The need for furigana on such a form highlights a crucial and somewhat astonishing fact. The reading of kanji is not fixed. Some readings are conventional and more common than others, but different readings are always possible. Theoretically, a given character in a personal or place name can be pronounced in an infinite number of ways: conversely, a name pronounced in a certain way may be written with an endless variety of characters. This feature stands out most in the case of personal names. As an example, let us take one Japanese female name, Yoshiko, for which a dictionary suggests more than ten combinations of Chinese characters. Other characters are possible as well. Figure 2: U (to like), (good), (liberal), jIkT (pleasure), f r - f (fragrant), H -T * (beautiful), { = \u00a3 fr (excellent), M -T * (graceful), JS (joyous), (virtue), #;-T* (joy), fiT* (justice), jfr-T* (noble), 98 (auspicious)4 0 Some are quite common and expected, but others are not. The graph ko ~f, literally \"child,\" is often attached at the end of a female name, while the meanings of the other characters, corresponding to the reading yoshi, are cited in brackets. On first hearing it, the name Yoshiko sounds like the Japanese \" yoshF meaning \"good,\" but the various meanings of the Chinese characters above, which are all read as \"yoshf\\ show that the actual meaning in a given case may not always match this presumed denotation. Rather they are like a loose set of synonyms of \"good\". For instance, \u00a3 j p implies \"like as opposed to dislike,\" \"good in terms of quality,\" and Hr \"good in a moral sense.\" Interestingly M primarily refers to the beautiful and graceful characteristics of (especially) women. The reading \" yoshF thereby earries die implication of as the kind of \"goodness\" that is expected of a girl. In this way, a character can have an infinite variety of readings. The writer, the one who chooses the character, decides. For example, the name in addition to Yoshiko, also can be read as Nobuko, Haruko, Hisako, Yukiko4 1 , among other on 4 2 As a consequence, people from time to time face a slightly awkward situation when they need to ask someone, \"How do you pronounce your name?\" or \"Which Yoshiko is that?\". Such incidents are far less frequently experienced in English or other languages that have more fixed rules governing the relations between the written language and the spoken language. The instances cited above may be attributed to the inherently loose relationship existing between written Chinese characters and how they are read or pronounced in 4 0 UedaBannen (et al.) 1993, Shin-daijiten (Kodansha, Tokyo). 4 1 Ueda 1993,407. 4 2 Ueda 1993, 1946. 99 Japan.4 3 From the fourth century CE onward,4 4 when Chinese characters were first imported from China and Korea, there have been two main ways of handling this foreign writing system. One is to use Chinese characters just as they are, along with Chinese grammar, but adopting Japanese pronunciation. This became the kanbun X (classical Chinese) tradition, which ^vas widely nsed by intellectuals for academic writing until the end of the Edo period. For example, the preface of Bydka suchi , written in kanbun style, concludes thus: (These few words make up the preface)\". If this were read in modem Chinese, it would be pronounced ncibianc i shu y u y i woi x u as follows: 7 7 # Jlfcifcin , However, kanbun style alters the reading and the sunavachi kono sugo o benjiootta jo to nasu order in this way\" 7 b # St m M # (Jbh t & The second way that Japanese handled this foreign language was to provide each Chinese character with a reading or readings .using an indigenous Japanese word that corresponded to the character's literal meaning. For example, a character such as (body) is given the native Japanese reading karada (known as the kun IJl! pronunciation), which has similar meanings. In addition to karada, 'ffc may also be read tai. This is a modified version of the Chinese pronunciation of the character ti (known as the on ^ = r pronunciation). However, the sound tai alone is not straightforwardly associated with \"body\" in Japanese. Like tai and karada, in the Japanese writing system most Chinese characters have at least two or more readings. The correct reading is usually indicated by its position within a sentence or word. Here furigana can be of assistance to indicate the reading. 4 3 The general history of furigana is best referenced by Ariga , Vol. 44, No. 3 (Autumn, 1989), 309-335. 4 4 From the standpoint of how Chinese texts were read in the countries surrounding China, the history and characteristics of Kanbun culture in Japan is best referenced by Komicki (2008). Peter Komicki 2008, 'Having difficulty with Chinese? - The rise of the vernacular book in Japan, Korea and Vietnam', Sandars Lectures 2008, available at: http://www. lib .cam.ac.uk/sandars/SandarsJLectures 2008.html. 100 Figure 3: (far/), {karada) Similarly, it is not unusual for a Chinese character to have more than one reading in Chinese or in Korean, depending on the context. In terms of its role as an aid to pronunciation, furigana recalls the Chinese Bopomofo system that is used in Taiwan and Hong Kong. This is the traditional Chinese phonetic syllabary consisting of thirty-seven phonetic characters and four tone markings, which is used as a guide to the pronunciation of a Ohinese character through the combination of an syllable onset and rime. But unlike kana letters, Bopomofo alone cannot normally make sentences. A I Figure 4: (death) = A (consonant [onset]: S) + I (vowel [rime]: I) = Si Furigana differ from Bopomofo in two ways. Firstly they are totally writer-dependent, and secondly they play a prominent role in the translation or k arada annotation of Chinese characters. As we have seen in , furigana function as a medium of translation that domesticates the foreignness of the characters. When a Chinese character possesses plural meanings, furigana serve to convey these various nuances and possibilities. Comparing the influence of Chinese vocabulary on Japanese to that of Attic Greek or Latin on English can perhaps give a clearer picture of the way furigana function. Imagine, for example, that you were to come across the letters \"aOopo<;\" in Greek, and you did not know how to pronounce them, what furigana -English might possibly be appended (figure 5)? 101 melancholy black bile depression gloom b l u e dejection originally refers to the state of being \"not spiritual\" in Greek, and is often translated into English as \"melaneholy\". Yet you might think of more varieties of furigana that would take into consideration subtle variations of contextual meaning. Here the furigana serve as translation as well as a reading (pronunciation) aid. Similarly, even if you know \" anima \" is pronounced /anima/ (or /'andmo/), furigana enable you to acquire the receptors to read and interpret in a certain way. a i r b reath s o u l l i f e sp irit ghost exact connotations of anima , but the compounds still allow the various shades of meaning to resonate from both the pronunciation and the visual effect of the written word. In a similar way, furigana serve as powerful guides to reading and interpreting the characters. This use of furigana as a gloss is one of the most distinctive features of Byoka suchi , and it succeeds in broadening the expressiveness of the text considerably. As examples, I will discuss a few terms written with Chinese characters in Byoka suchi that have the appended furigana 'karada ' (body). Figure 7 4 5 S.C. Woodhouse 1932, English-Greek Dictionary (Routledge & Kegan Paul, London), 523. 4 6 P. G . W. Glare 1982, Oxford Latin Dictionary (The Clarendon Press, Oxford), 132. 102 karada Kara d o karadaCompounds in Byoka suchi Ml\u00ae Literal meaning ki and blood transport life Conventional reading kiketsu unyu seimei The three compounds in Figure 7, taken together, echo the author's ideas about the human body. Hirano regards the body as a living organism that transports and circulates life-sustaining ki and blood within it, and this movement of ki is human life itself. Though the furigana may appear detached from conventional readings, the compounds, taken together, build up an intricate picture of the body based on Az-medicine. Although the Chinese-character expressions Ml\u00ae, and had already become common terms in Japanese medicine by this time, the karada further encodes them in a larger semantic unit in which the author's perspective on the body is condensed. In fact the free appending of furigana is not peculiar to Byoka suchi, but is commonly found in Edo-period writings, particularly in popular literature. Although the exact reason behind the elastic relations between Chinese characters and furigana in Edo-period writings is unknown, decoding furigana challenges our existing concept of translation. We tend to consider translation as an act of looking for a substitutable word or phrase in one tongue to replace a word or phrase in another. However Kuriyama (2004) points out that appending furigana rather creates a new hybrid in which native and foreign notions are incorporated simultaneously. Moreover in importing medical knowledge from China, and later from the West as well, furigana could play the role of mediator. Basically, imported technical terms are often represented by Chinese characters. Subsequently, those adopted or translated terms also come to embrace more familiar notions as the 103 furigana of indigenous words are appended to them.4 7 The use of furigana in Byoka suchi highlights the process of digesting ideas represented in Chinese characters into everyday Japanese. With acknowledgements to the definitive guide to the study of translation by Steiner (1975), it is possible to regard furigana as \"conceptual translation\". The schematic model of translation is one in which a message from a source language passes into a receptor-language via a transformational process. The barrier is the obvious fact that one language differs from the other, that an interpretative transfer, sometimes, albeit misleadingly, described as encoding and decoding, must occur so that the message 'gets through' .4 8 The hybrid nature of ywnga\u00aba-character compounds also epitomises the multiple characteristics of Edo-period medicine itself, in which all kinds of ideas and practices rooted in indigenous, Chinese and Western traditions are mixed and interwoven. Writing on the historical development of medical ideas in China, Unschuld (1985) claims that the transmission of knowledge is rarely free from the influence of differences in cultural framework. Ideas must be transmitted by the head, and, of necessity, will undergo change. Where could a foreign idea be accepted, assimilated, or transmitted without being influenced by the particular situation it meets, by the changing languages that serve as its means of transportation, and by the preconditioned patterns of 4 7 Kuriyama 2004,30-31. 4 8 Steiner 1975,29. 104 thought cherished by the final receiver?4 9 Furigana play a significant role in transmitting yojo knowledge in Edo-period culture. Due to dependence on Chinese medicine, most technical terms in Edo-period medicine were written in Chinese characters. However Japanese traditional medicine had gradually deviated from medicine in China proper in both ideas and practices, just as the \"Chinese medical tradition\" itself was in a process of development and change. We also need to remember that in China, yangsheng jtdfc was practised mainly by intellectuals, while yojo texts in Edo-period Japan were disseminated among a more general audience, whose intellectual background and medical knowledge were different. Therefore it can be said that the /wng*wa-character compounds in Byoka suchi mirror certain gaps between foreign and native shades of meaning. The proeedure of appending furigana is precisely the author's reconstruction of these imported medical concepts: his solution to the problem of how to flesh out Chinese medical knowledge for the general Japanese reader. 2-3. Keywords I propose in the following sections to discuss five terms which are especially critical to understanding the imagination of health and sickness in Byoka suchi : karada (body), kokoro (mind), hara (abdomen), and shaku (congealed clump). 2-3-1. Karada and kokoro : the body and the mind 4 9 Unschuld 1985, 55. 105 The term karada is usually translated as \"body\" in English. In Byoka suchi it k o rn d a karada most frequently appears as an appended furigana in M or # f \u00a7 , but it is also appended to a variety o f other Chinese characters (Table 1), Through an examination r* of these karada- character compounds, this glossary firstly elucidates the perception of the body in Byoka suchi , and secondly the idea of mind, which often stands in contrast with the body. To begin with, we need to ponder the question: is karada really replaceable with \"body\" in English, or indeed f\u00a7 and # f S in Chinese characters? For example, an English dictionary explains \"body\" as \"the physical structure, including the bones, flesh, and organs, of a person or an animal\", or sometimes more specifically \"the trunk apart from the head and the limbs\".5 0 According to Chinese terminology, on the other hand, refers to the whole of the head, the trunk and the limbs53. However, as a component in the compound noun # 1 6 , # 5 2 corresponds in particular to the head and the trunk, while fit refers to the limbs. Standing alone, # refers to the physical structure of the body, and occasionally means \"self' or \"the trunk and the limbs apart from the head\".5 3 Moreover inasmuch as Chinese physiology is based on the concept of qU the Chinese body essentially consists of qi, an idea whieh without doubt affects the view of body in the Edo period also. Byoka suchi imposes the reading karada on more than sixteen character compounds that evoke a huge variety of ideas of the body (Figure 8). 5 0 Judy Pearsall (ed) 2002, Concise Oxford English Dictionary (Oxford University Press, tenth edition, revised, New York), 153. 5 1 fSx Shuowen jiezi zhu By Xu Shen fHH, annotated by Duan E cEEiSc Qing dynasty.

The issue of the heart leads us directly to the question of kokoro (mind), which will be examined in the following section. Ki circulation Firstly, Byoka suchi considers the good circulation of ki and all kinds of fluids in the body to be more vital than anything else for preserving life. This reflects the fundamental principle of medicine whereby the make-up of the human body is explained by the concept of ki, its most vital constituent, as encoded in the compound k arada k arada M ik or Jj\u00a7P!^(lk. For example Lingshu ' jueqi explains that qi/ki which takes on the colour red within the body becomes blood. Qi/ki and blood are jessentially the same: the former is formless, while the latter has form5 4 . The furigana in Byoka suchi entail the notion that ki and blood are essentially the same, and that these two fluids are indispensable components of the body. k i c h i k a r a d a karada Figure 9: ki M ik \u2014 * blood ^ i k \u2014 > body ^ J k \u2014 body Jk'\u00ae karada karada k arada raeguri Figure body ik'$\u00a3 \u2014 > body MUi circulation H tti 5 4 Lingshu ' jueqi 499. 108 karada karada body 3H#i \u2014 * body karada noguri Phrases like \"the circulation of the body (^ik<5D51l#) of ki and blood)\" or \"body (ill#) transport)\" demonstrate that Byoka suchi views the body as an organic entity that transports ki to conduct life. This emphasis on movement within the body, and focus on its organic function rather than physical structure, is derived from traditional Chinese physiology. Ishida (1995) points out the composite understanding of the human body in Chinese medical tradition. The body is often viewed as a \"flowing entity which is sustained by the movement of qi inside and around the person. This leads to another view of the body as a \"static stage Wot U T where the operations of qi take plaee.5 5 In this perspective, zangfu J8W (the internal organs) and mai M e (vessels), though themselves products of qi, merely play a secondary role as containers or routes where qi/ki indwells and operates. Similarly, Yamada (1999) makes an analogy between the movement of qi within the body, which is manifested in all kinds of bodily fluids and inhaled breath, and the flowing of water. The circulation of qi through the channels that connect the extremities with the vital centres can be compared to the flowing of water through water conduits. This \"water model\" of the body lays emphasis on movement in the body, rather than discrete organs.5 6 Yamada observes that the concepts of vessels and channels (fing 8 ) originate from a model of water conduits in the external world, and Ishida also considers the flowing model to be more intrinsic to human life than the notion of a static stage. These \"flowing\" or \"water conduit\" models highlight the fact that Chinese 5 1999 a, 97-99,142-143. 109 yangsheng is acutely conscious of qi circulation. As we have seen in Chapter 1, therapeutic gymnastics, breath regulation and the like are all intended to stimulate the moderate movement of qi in and around the body, thereby preserving health. Yet it seems there are two differences between Chinese and Edo-period Japanese views of qi/ki circulation. Firstly, the central concern for Chinese yangsheng is the fear of losing qi, which causes depletion (xu rft), a condition that leaves the body in a vulnerable state. This is most evident in such practices as dietetics, qi exercise ffand sexual cultivation. It is claimed that, no matter how significant the movement of body qi may be, one should never overexert oneself, as this will just result in exhaustion and depletion. The essential point is replenishment by means of taking in fine qi. For instance, dietetics aims to take qi into the body from foodstuffs. As far as qi exercise is concerned, the legendary physician of antiquity Hua Tuo is supposed to have told his pupil Wu Pu \"It is desirable for one to take exercise, but one never should do it to excess\".5 7 Sexual cultivation instructs practitioners to avoid ejaculation and to circulate semen, the finest qi, around the body to replenish the brain. Excessive practice just results in the loss of semen, and the highest achievement is to take qi from one's partner (generally female) to nourish the self. In contrast, fear of depletion is much less of a concern for Edo-period medicine. For instance Yojokun juxtaposes ki depletion and stagnation as the two most harmful factors. There are two kinds of harm for the cultivation of life. One is to decrease vital essence; the other is to allow it to stagnate. Excessive eating and drinking, 5 7 Houhamhu, 'fanshu Hua Tuo UP'fe, 2739-2740. 110 sexual desire, and exercise will damage and decrease vital essence, whereas excessive eating and drinking, rest and sleep will cause it to stagnate and become blocked. Decrease and stagnation both damage vital essence.5 8 t' This fear of stagnation crescendos in Byoka suchi . Instead of depletion, the text insists that stagnation is the cause of various diseases. One should work hard at one' s family vocation, carry out self-massage, and not overindulge in rich and heavy foods. Pent-up emotion, like too much worry or anger, also causes ki stagnation and forms a clump in the abdomen. In Chinese yangsheng , qi intrinsically and constantly moves within the human body through jingluo , which form circuits, and also through the jingxue (acupoints), which exist along with the jingluo , and form orifices where qi can flow in and out. However Byoka suchi assumes that the circulation of ki requires deliberate effort. If one does not move ki forcefully by exercise, massage or hard work, it will easily become stagnant. If you do not neglect your duty by day and night, the body's digestion will be good. You will not be bothered by wearing heavy clothing, eating too much or drinking too much. As the proverb says, flowing water does not become putrid and the hinges of a door do not rot. This is because they are all in motion. If you wish to live free of diseases and yearn for happiness, two things are paramount: duty and thrift.5 9 Both duty (tsutome jj: to exert) and thrift ( tsumashiki ^ ) are acts of effort. Even though it quotes the famous proverb from Lushi chunqiu, Byoka suchi contends 5 8 Yojokun, 30. 5 9 BS 1:6-7. Ill that one cannot just wait for bodily ki to flow as water does from high to low. Rather, it is necessary to work diligently and \"exert\" one' s body, thereby promoting the proper movement of ki. The same view is also found regarding the cultivation of wet-nurses. An employer should not let a wet nurse simply remain idle when she does not have to take care of the baby. In her spare time she must do other duties konasu such as laundry or running errands, which will improve the digestion (M W } exercise) in her body.6 0 Here again, keeping spare power j k f j in reserve is merely regarded as \"laziness\", which causes stagnation. Absence of the internal organs Secondly the image of the body in Byoka suchi is notable for the absence of the internal organs. Most of the instances of organ names are limited to the intestines and karada karada stomach, as seen in the collocations body-\u00ae? or body-HUff. However these terms fro not necessarily refer to the intestines .and stomach as such, but often to the abdominal area, denoted by the furigana hara : k a rada h a r a hara no uchi Figure 11: body 1 3 Jiff -* abdomen M W inside abdomen M ft h ara ai abdominal condition MW Chinese medical tradition classifies the internal organs into five zang (viscera: heart 'L\\ lungs J J r f c , spleen |$ , liver IT, kidneys Tf) and six fit (entrails: small intestines /hJjJI, large intestines zfcjjjl, stomach ft, gallbladder Jjl, bladder M J D fc, three burners H ^ ) . The five zang are connected to each other by jingluo ; and in 6 0 BS 3:10. 112 accordance with the physiological hierarchy, the zang organs predominate over the six fit. The six fit are mainly regarded as a vacant container, playing a secondary role to that of zang. But why then does Byoka suchi particularly mention the intestines and stomach, two o f the fit, and make them represent the whole body by the reading karada ? Two things may suggest the possible answer to this. Firstly, Byoka suchi considers the abdomen to be the centre of gravity of the body. Secondly, the intestines and stomach are the site where digestion takes place; and according to the physiology of Byoka suchi , \"digestion\" does not just refer to the process of ingesting food and drink, but often implies as well the flowing movement of ki within the whole body. When you have a difficult, congealed disease, if you do not wish to take medicines, you must give up rich food, aleohol and sexual pleasure, and maintain temperance in daily conduct. In so doing, you will cause no k o n a r c k a r a d a disturbance in the digestion (5Hft: transport) of your body (H iff: intestines and stomach) and no blockage in your mind.6 1 We see that digestion is a matter of the function of the whole \"body\", which is referred to by a term that literally indicates the intestines and stomach. The significance of the abdominal area and digestion will be further delineated later in the glossaries of hara (abdomen) and konare (digestion). The focus on the abdominal area is further emphasised by the absence of mention of other organs. Apart from the abdomen (hara), Byoka suchi mentions the chest (mum), but references to the heart are rare. Mum is appended to either M l (the 6 1 BS 5:9. 113 chest, the breast, the mind) or 'L > (the heart, the mind). Mune for M l is mostly identified as the chest, sometimes including the diaphragm or ribs; while in a context like \"remove depression in your mune , and listen (to the teaching) in peace\"6 2 , mune can be synonymous with the mind. On the other hand, when the character >5 is read as either kokoro or mune , it mostly indicates \"the mind\" (Table 3, 4). In Byoka suchi, in the sense of \"the heart\" as an organ appears only a few times in compounds tnunehftra raizuochi such as 'f'H I (heart and abdomen) or d l'T (literally below the heart, i.e., the pit of the stomach). Miyachi (1979) points out that in ancient Japanese, kokoro is not clearly differentiated from mune or chest with its throbbing, aching, and waves of emotion.6 3 To sum up, whether read as mune or kokoro , M l and in Byoka suchi mostly refer to ei ther the mind or the chest (or more broadly the upper body), but not to the heart as an organ. The omission of the organs seems to correspond to the origin of the word karada , as given in Wakun no shiori (A guide to Japanese reading) compiled by Tanikawa Kotosuga ^ J 1 |\u00b1 M , a Japanese linguistic scholar, in 1775. This text explains that karada is composed of kara vk, (cast-off) shell and tachi \u00b1L, standing.6 4 It also resonates with another Japanese word kara, meaning \"vacant\" Surveying the vocabulary of the body in literature from ancient times to the twentieth century, Miyachi (1979) reveals that until the early Edo period, karada meant bodily form or corpse This suggests that karada initially denoted the \"exterior\" of the human body, and was used in popular language for the cast-off part that is left by the mind or the soul. Later, people began to use karada as a general term for the body, whether alive or lifeless, and sometimes karada came to indicate 6 2 BS 2:39. 6 3 Atsuko (1775) by Tanikawa Kotosuga (edition unknown. Printed in the Edo period, held at Keio University), vol. 2, 27. 114 the trunk and/or limbs in contradistinction to the head.6 5 The semantics of karada underwent certain changes which are reflected in various furigana / Chinese character collocations in Byoka suchi. In particular, the sense of karada as the external part of a human being is found in the compound karada {exterior body), used in the context of discussing the -relation between body and soul. The mind and the soul The inteipretation of the term immediately raises questions of the mind. Byoka suchi mainly uses two terms for the mental faculties, kokoro the mind and tamashi ' i the soul. Where are they to be found? And what do they do? In most cases the character 'L' is employed for kokoro , and other characters are rarely used. What is indicated by kokoro seems closest to \"the mind\" in English, generally referring to the part which thinks and feels, while tamashi' i can be matched with \"the soul\", the spiritual core of a person. Byoka suchi more or less differentiates mind, soul and feeling, but die term overlaps all these categories (Table 3, 4, 5 and 6).

Lingshu identifies xin '0 , the heart, as 'The great master of the five viscera and the six entrails, the abode of jingshen If# , the essential spirit\".6 6 The spirit is the finest essence of the ki that comes from the food and drink that one ingests.6 7 As to its location, the spirit is not fixed in the heart alone, since the five functions of the mind are divided among the five viscera. The heart stores shen # (spirit), the lungs po 86 (po-soul), the liver hun (/i\u00abw-soul), the spleen yi M (will), and the kidney zhi (intent).6 8 Hun and po are mobile and go in and out of the human body. Hun is formless qi, belonging to yang , while po is manifested in form which belongs to yin. Their functions are akin to the soul. As far as yi and zhi are concerned, Lingshu explains that yi is the thoughts and ideas in the mind, while zhi is the faculty of decision of yi. Zhi and yi control the spirit, store hun and po, harmonise coldness 6 6 Lingshu 'xieke 277. 6 7 Lingshu, 'pinrenqueke 509. 6 8 Suwen, 'zhuanmingwuqi 153. 117 and warmth, and soothe (the emotions of) joy and anger.6 9 However, it is more accurate to say that the spirit is divided into five phases, and that each resides in one of the five qi entities of the viscera. The liver stores blood where hun resides, the spleen stores rong (structural qi) where yi resides, the heart stores mai \"(vessels) where shen resides, die lung stores qi where po resides, and the kidney stores jing where zhi resides.7 0 In this sense it is possible to say that the mind resides in flowing qi, and the five viscera serve as containers for them. The relation between the spirit and heart in Chinese medical tradition was long acknowledged in the semantics of the Japanese term as shown in an Edo-period encyclopaedia Wakan sansaizue by Terashima Ryoan which describes the heart as \"the ruler of all organs and the seat of spiritual activities\".7 1 This was the case even after the influence of Western anatomy, when the idea of heart as the centre of the circulatory system o f the blood had become widespread.7 2 Thus Byoka suchi also casually mentions that if you wish to know what is going on in your mind (> L N and m mune # kokoro no uchi), you should look into the mirror in your chest M l . On the other hand, it is explained that nightmares are often due to an unbalance in the head, kokoro mochi which is related to emotion f t # . From these statements it is difficult to establish where Byoka suchi places the abode of the mental faculty; and there is no reference to the heart, five viscera or brain. 6 9 Lingshu, 'benshen 163. 7 2 Kaitai shinsho first diffused anatomical knowledge about the human body including the function of the heart.

We find many examples in Japanese literature through die ages where the soul {tamashi 7) from time to time slips out of the body owing to death, sleep, or deep thought (including love). For instance, Kokin wakashu {Collective poems ancient and modem, compiled by Kino Tsurayuki beginning of the tenth century CE) contains a love poem by an unknown author: \"If my soul (tamashi' i) drifts away because I lament so much over my unrequited love, will my body remain to be spoken off as an empty cast-off shell ( kara)T\\ 7 5 In the same way, Byoka suchi considers that the soul is mobile, residing only temporarily in the mortal body. tamashi' i The soul fife # is neither bom nor can it die. It can see despite being formless and hear despite being soundless, and it is almost unimaginably subtle. It is assumed that the soul originally belongs to the self. Yet it dwells only karada temporarily in this body governs vital ki, breathes the air, and maintains warmth, life, and operation7 6 , fife# for tamashi 7 is originally a Buddhist term and a Chinese rendition of the Sanskrit vijhana meaning \"soul\" or \"mind\", more specifically defined as \"the art o f distinguishing, or discerning\" or \"perception through knowledge\".7 7 In Byoka suchi, the language of the soul does not directly incorporate either the literal meaning of the Buddhism term fife# for perception, or die Chinese understanding of jingshen as 7 5 ^ L # 5 $ ^ 69^3 w b t s , 6 7 Nakamura Gen 1981, Bukkyogo Daijigen (Tokyo shoseki, Tokyo), 579. Iwano Fumiyo 1991, Japanese-English Buddhist Dictionary (revised edition, Heibunsha, Tokyo), 309. 119 the spirit dwelling in the heart. The eternity and immortality of the soul form a contrast with the body IE vk (exterior body), which emphasises the body's physicality. The idea of the body as the container of the mind is also found in Chinese tradition. For instance Lunheng fmUr (Balanced Discussions) by Wang Chong (c. 27-100) describes how the spirit jingshen is stored in the body \"just like cereals are in a sack\". However the soul in Byoka suchi is different from the Chinese spirit, which is stored in the five viscera, and ultimately flows through the body and fills it as the phases of qi. Mobility o f mind is mentioned in < x uanzi \"How the mind M circulates is just like the circulation of qi in the heavens\".7 9 Furthermore Byoka suchfs version of soul seems unique in comparison with other contemporary Japanese medieal texts. For instanee, IJidtaiseiron gekai situates tamashi' i the soul in the heart, and the idea of S # seems to follow the traditional account of Huangdi neijing. The heart is the lord of officials, the head of the five viscera and the six entrails. The working o f the whole body depends on the heart, and the heart works by tamashi* i order of the soul M # , Thus the heart receives the orders for the whole body... The heart is where the soul resides, and it stores all the workings of intelligence.8 0 7 8 Lunheng, compiled by Wang Chong TEA (possibly between c.70-80 CE), edition, 'zibu T-nflE, 'longlunsi Guanzi HrA, by Guan Zhong HHIb Put together in its present form by Liu Xiang ^J[r] in about 26 BCE. SBCK edition, 'zibu E F p R ', vol. 9, 416. Hereafter referred to as KKIS edition. 120 In contrast, in Byoka suchi , the soul is described as being the \"same as demons or ghosts i n # \"8 1 , and it functions as the eternal core of a person upon which one's conscience and integrity rely. \"So mysterious and enigmatic is the soul that it knows things that are far away, makes no mistake in remembering what has happeried in the past, and makes no error in foreseeing what is yet to occur in the future\".8 2 This image of the mysterious, all-powerful soul is unique to Byoka suchi , and it may be possible to detect a certain influence from Western ideas of the soul.8 3 Although this is merely a speculation, Hirano Jusei's mention of using a microscope to find worms or parasites ill in rotten food8 4 at least suggests that he had come across some ideas of Western science. To summarise, Byoka suchi refers to the mind kokoro and the soul tamashi ' i together as the mental faculty. Kokoro generally indicates a location in the chest where one thinks and feels, but it is not precisely related to the heart. On the other hand, the soul exists above all material existence, and only temporarily resides in the mortal, physical body. In the context of discussing the metaphysical nature of the soul, the body is often described as a hollow container. 2-3-2. Hara : abdomen as the centre of the body Examining Byoka suchi in search of references to internal organs, one is surprised to find how few of the organs are referred to by name, and how many variations of Chinese characters are read hara , the abdomen (Table 7, 8, 9). Even hara when the Chinese characters indicate particular organs like J3 \u00a7 Pf (intestines and 8 1 BS 1:17. 8 2 BS 1:18.o o This was suggested by Shigehisa Kuriyama, to whom I would like to express my gratitude. 8 4 BS 2:7. 121 stomach) or W (stomach), in most cases the appended furigana \"hara\" has the effect of muting this specificity. This neglect of individual organs conversely leads to an emphasis on the abdomen.

Other expressions with hara This section examines how the abdomen acquired higher significance pot only in Byoka suchi but also in Japanese culture during and after the Edo period. The emphasis on the abdomen had been long established in Japan, and a broad examination through the ages will reveal that Byoka suchi epitomises a view of the body which was widely shared among the Japanese. The argument is set out mainly from three perspectives. Firstly, in Japanese tradition, there was a strong consciousness of the abdomen, which was seen as the centre of both physical and spiritual power. Secondly, in the Edo period, concern with the abdomen is inextricably linked with pathology and diagnosis in the medical context. Thirdly, concern with the abdomen is methodically reflected in cultivating-life practices. Centre of the body Byoka suchi offers a guide to the proper manner of walking in order to put the bodily form to rights. When you walk, the part of the body that you should be most conscious of is the abdomen. All your concern should lie in pushing the lower abdomen /TD M (shita hara) forward at the waist. As you do so, strength accumulates under the navel, the lower abdomen TIM (shita hara) becomes replete with ki, the breath reaches under the navel, and nothing obstructs the chest, the ribs, and the pit of the stomach. You feel that the power of the whole body is in the area under the ornavel and the waist. 8 5 BS 1:11. 124 This account plainly asserts that the abdomen is the centre and pivot of the body. Ydjdketsu, another yojo text by Hirano Jusei, further explains that the abdomen acts as the centre of gravity of the body. For example when one shoulders a heavy burden, the body invariably bends forward; and when one carries something in front, the back invariably bends backward. Likewise when one leans to the right, [the body] curves to the left; and when one leans left, [the body] curves to the right. The balance always depends on the weight of the object one is holding, and gravitates to the front, back, right and left. Shifting the centre is just like weighing an object on a scale (Ydjdketsu)}6 No matter which way one's body leans, as long as the posture of the abdominal area is correct, the body can keep its balance. This consciousness of the abdomen grew stronger still after the Edo period. For instance Karlfried Graf Diirckheim, a German who spent about ten years in Japan during the Second World War, discusses the subject of the abdomen in Japanese culture in his Hara B\u00b1 Die Erdmitte des Menschen (Hara, the vital centre of man, 1945),8 7 He observes that the abdomen weighs heavily in both the mind and the body of the Japanese, for it is not just the centre of gravity of the body, but the root of human life and vitality, a concept which is based on the traditional theory of mind-body unity. Diirckheim emphasises 8 6 Eisei 3:156. 8 7 Originally published in Germany, Karlfried Graf Diirckheim 1956, Hara: Die Erdmitte des Menschen . used English translation: translated by Sylvia-Monica von Kospoth & Estelle R. Healey 1962, Hara, the vital center of man (George Allen & Unwin Ltd, London). For the philosophical analysis of the Eastern body from the viewpoint of mind-body unity, see for instance Yuasa Yasuo 1990, Shintairon (Kodansha, Tokyo). 125 that it is crucial to leam how to use the abdomen properly by maintaining good posture and cultivating a calm physical sensation in the lower abdomen. A certain resemblance to Bydka suchi in Diirckheim's description of the ideal way of sitting is noticeable. ' In right sitting as well as in right standing the shoulders are relaxed. Only in the released belly is that slight tension preserved which gives strength to the whole trunk. In the Hara-seat the aspirant feels the center which keeps him in form, perhaps even more clearly than while standing.8 8 Diirckheim's view, though a little romanticised, shows that the emphasis on the abdomen continued more than a hundred years after Bydka suchi . In every action, one must be conscious of the abdomen as centred and settled, thereby maintaining the balance of the body as a whole. Spiritual centre Bydka suchi regards the abdomen as the pivot of the body, but does not find any spirituality there. On the other hand, the psychologist and philosopher Diirckheim had a more metaphysical approach. Inspired by the mysterious relationship between body and mind that he finds in the Asian tradition, he claims that not only physical strength but also \"supernatural strength\" resides in the abdomen. It makes possible extraordinary achievements, because the abdomen represents a maturity that comes from within.8 9 8 8 DOrckheim, 126. 8 9 Dtirckheim, 18. 126 Finding himself in Hara means then two things: liberation from the wrong I, the one not in contact with Being and hence from the pseudo-self, and the opening of a way to the right I, which is in contact with Being, and ultimately to the true Self.9 0 According to Durckheim, the abdomen was endowed with high significance in Japanese thinking. Tanaka (1993) also points out an old idiomatic expression for the ideal state of the abdomen, i.e. taiko-bara (potbelly, literally \"drum-belly\"). This was not an object of derision or distaste, but a symbol of an important man with 91gravitas. Where spirituality resides, the right mind is also found. For instance, M s hi keisei hara no uchi (Fourteen courtesans inside the abdomen, by Shiba Zenko illustrated by Kitao Shigemasa published in 1793)92, one of the kibydshi (Yellow Cover) booklets,9 3 represents the interior of the body by personifying the internal organs. 9 4 The interior of the courtesan's body is likened to a merchant's house, where the liver works as head clerk, the spleen and stomach are a delicatessen, and so on. At the same time it comically shows how the words of a courtesan are at odds with her real thoughts, i.e., what is going on within her abdomen. 9 0 Diirckheim, 156. 9 1 Tanaka Satoshi 1993, Naze Taiko-bara gesaku ehon vol. 4 (Shakaishisosha, Tokyo), 47-86. 9 3 The Yellow Cover booklets contain relatively short, entertaining tales with illustrations. This is said to have been the most popular type of literature during the Edo period, and more than 2000 booklets were published from 1775 to 1806. 9 4 This is a parody of the acupuncture text Jushi keiro hakki wage (Japanese annotation of the fourteen vessels) by Okamoto Ipposhi which is an commentary on Shisijingfahui a Chinese acupuncture text of the Yuan period by Hua Poren $f . Screech also discusses the impact of anatomy on Edo popular culture, Timon Screech 1997, Edo no karada o hiraku (Sakuhinsha, Tokyo), 177-207. 127 Courtesan 1: Really, I love you so much. How can you say such a heartless thing to me! Inside her abdomen 41 hara no naka ): He is a disgusting customer, but he may be useful. So I must cry like this, and force him to pay the bill. Well, it is so funny, ha-ha-ha.9 5 This dialogue shows that the term \"hara no uchi (inside the abdomen)\" has a double meaning. That is, one's real thoughts are equated with the internal organs, i.e., the five viscera and six entrails. Shirasugi (2001) observes that the idea of peering into the interior of the abdomen to see the soul was a common theme in the popular literature of the Edo period.9 6 People's curiosity to see inside the human soul and the interior of the human body was accentuated by the circulation of anatomical texts in the late eighteenth century. For instance Yamawaki Toyo published his observations of anatomical dissection in 1754 as Zoshi jSSics (Record of the viscera, 1759). Kaitai shinsho, a translation of a Dutch anatomy, caused a sensation among both scholars and the general public.9 7 The association of the abdomen with spirituality, though not found in Bydka suchi, is still enshrined in Japanese idioms nowadays. When we talk of \"splitting the abdomen 6 (hara o waru )\", it indicates that we are showing our real intentions frankly, while \"to probe into the abdomen (hara o saguru )\" means to try to find out what others are really thinking about. 9 3 Koike 1983, 53. 9 6 Shirasugi Etsuo 2001, 'Envisioning the Inner Body in Edo Japan: The Imhokuyojo kagami (Rules of Dietary Life) and Bojiyojo kagami (Rules of Sexual Life)', in Kuriyama, 31- 49. 7 Sakai (1994) investigates how knowledge of Western anatomy was transmitted within society. Sakai Shizu 1997, '17/18 and Kuriyama, 431-455. 128 Pathology of the abdomen We shall look next at the importance of the abdomen from the viewpoint of pathology and diagnosis. As far as Bydka suchi is concerned, such compounds as hara no uchi h a r _ a hara no uchi 1*0 l i e , I N a /1 6 , and 1*0 pft suggest that the abdomen stands for the entfails as a whole, or even more simply, the interior of the body. As mentioned before, if \"the h a r a no u c h i balance inside the abdomen is disturbed, one ends up suffering from difficult and complicated illnesses.9 8 Abdominal disorders seriously affect the whole body, and all kinds of pathological conditions manifest in the abdomen. This conversely leads to the idea that as long as the abdomen remains well, it guarantees life. For instance Ydjdkun claims, 'the ki of the stomach is a synonym of vital energy tg ;^, that is, harmonious central ki Even if the disease is serious, as long as one has stomach ki, one will live\".9 9 In terms of pathology, there are two great fears regarding the abdomen. One is the fear of disturbed digestion due to excessive or inappropriate eating, which becomes the cause of various diseases. If you eat too much and feel too full, the abdomen BiW (hara) becomes bloated, the digestion is bad, the body gradually weakens, and the circulation of the blood becomes bad. A small congealed clump develops inside the abdomen B M r{ n (hara no uchi) and grows in size, knotting into a larger clump known as shaku (congealed clump), while the spirit becomes depressed and you do not feel at ease in your daily life. This will be the cause of serious diseases.1 0 0 9 8 BS 1:18. 9 9 Ydjdkun, 50. 1 0 0 BS 1:9. 129 The other fear about the abdomen concerns the development of congealed clumps. In Bydka suchi , this condition is often expressed as shaku or hara no katamari - S # (habitual clump). Shaku is recognised as a palpable clump, produced by causes ranging from anxiety to unrestrained eating. Both \"konare digestion\" and ilshaku congealed clump\" are discussed in separate sections, but here I would like to mention how the significance of the abdomen is manifested in the theory and practice of Edo-period medicine. As Bydka suchi bears out, the significance of the abdominal area weighs heavily in Edo-period medicine, and many physicians had begun to seek pathogens there. For instance Yoshimasu To do (1702-1773), a prominent physician of the Classic School, maintains in his Idan (Deciding medicine, 1752): The abdomen is the root of life, therefore the roots of a hundred illnesses lie there. In diagnosing diseases, one must examine a patient's abdomen. Other symptoms are of secondary importance.1 0 1 This heightened consciousness of the abdomen affects diagnostic categories. Chinese medical tradition established four basic categories of diagnosis, that is, looking M (wang), listening and smelling ffl (wen), questioning |nl(wen), and touching (qie). In China, attention is concentrated mainly on qie, palpating the pulses. Abdominal examination was once included in touching, but Kagawa Shuan of the Classic School, for example, instituted abdominal diagnosis and back diagnosis W1& independently of the original four, and proposed that there should be 1 0 1 Yoshimasu Todo (1752) Idan (reprint 1993, edited (Shanghai Zhongyi Tokyo), 99-312. 130 six diagnoses Kagawa places abdominal diagnosis first among the six: \"My school regards abdominal palpation as the most essential of the six diagnoses. It is because one should generally be able to tell a person's strengths and weaknesses by palpating the abdomen\".1 0 2 The popularity of abdominal palpation was not limited to Kagawa Shuan, but was widespread among Edo-period physicians. Many texts specialising in abdominal palpation were published, some of which are available to us now, as they have been republished in Rinsho kampo shindangaku Sosho (Collection of clinical diagnosis of traditional medicine, 1995) or Nihon kampo fukushin sosho 0 ^ ill ^ BS # I t II (Collection of abdominal palpation in Japanese traditional medicine vol. 1-6, 1986).1 0 3 If all illnesses arise from the abdomen and manifest there, there can be no question about the importance of taking good care of it by means of daily yojo practice. As far as Bydka suchi is concerned, this text employs the orthodox \"four diagnoses\" but not abdominal diagnosis. Nonetheless, Hirano Jusei is also very much concerned to ascertain if anything seems to be wrong with the abdomen, saying \"one can 'see' the diseases in the patient's abdomen from the colour (complexion or hue) manifested in the face\". This is possible because the \"true ki H ^\\,\"flows directly from the elixir field, i.e. the centre of the body located in the abdomen, through the forehead and nose.1 0 4 This may allude to Hirano's belief that a skilled physician should \"see\", rather than \"touch\". 1 0 2 Ippondo koyo igen \u2014 by Kagawa Shuan. KKIS edition, vol. 65, 36. 1 0 3 A recent study classifies and analyses Japanese texts of abdominal palpation, Liao Yuqun (1997), 343-369. Abdominal palpation texts in these collections are categorised into three groups depending on their basis in medical classics. Nanjing !$\u00a3iH (Canon of difficulties, the Later Han), Shanghanlun, and Eclectic chu T1 , 6. 131 The abdomen in cultivating life Hara is hara (lit plain field)... The human abdomen is also called hara because it is a vast field where five viscera, six entrails, four limbs, and a hundred bones are nourished...As long as the form of the abdomen is wrong, you cannot set anything right at all, as so many techniques are needed for every behaviour. When you cultivate life and the abdominal form improves, your fortune will become better and your wishes will be fulfilled. Those who have ambitions should firstly master how to regulate the abdomen (Ydjdben).1 0 5 This statement from Ydjdben privileges the abdomen as an all-powerful key to cultivating life. It is by no means neglected in Bydka suchi . Taking the traditional idea of yojo as its basis, Bydka suchi particularly emphasises maintaining the tranquil function of the abdomen through such practices as proper diet, breath regulation, and massage. In particular, Bydka suchi is noteworthy for developing its own method of abdominal breath regulation. The breath enters through the nostrils, reaches below the naval, and is excreted through the nostrils again, issuing from below the navel. Afterwards it also issues as vapour from the ears and exits through the pores of the skin.1 0 6 In order to enable the breath to reach the lower abdomen, Hirano Jusei introduces the Zen sash for the repletion of the abdomen with breath, which he invented in Yojoketsu . It is a long sash, approximately six feet in length, which is 1 0 5 Eisei 4:59. 1 0 6 BS 1:11. 132 tied twice around the ribs, above the stomach, to concentrate the breath in the elixir field.1 0 7 Probably the idea is to tighten the upper body with the sash, thereby releasing the lower abdomen where ki should be abundant. Breath regulation in Chinese yangsheng also emphasises concentrating on the repletion with qi /ki of the area below the navel, the elixir field. Sakade (1999) observes that this begins as early as the Later Han dynasty, when yangsheng texts on breath regulation began to mention filling the elixir field with qi.m Thus the instructions in Bydka suchi are not unusual in Edo-period yojo texts. However the author does not expect the practice to bring about longevity; and this forms a contrast with Chinese yangsheng , where the primary aims of breath regulation are longevity and the preservation of health. Instead, Bydka suchi sees the chief effects of breath regulation in two areas: harmonising the mind and curing illnesses. Firstly, Byoka suchi repeatedly claims that one should be conscious of the abdomen being replete with ki at all times - when one is walking, sitting, sleeping, or waking. It recommends repeatedly that this should be practised in conjunction with abdominal massage. Through the constant practice of storing dispersed ki so as to fill the abdomen, one's mind becomes composed. The author's claims for the efficacy of this practice for the mental state are set out more clearly in Yojoketsu. When one inhales atmospheric air so that it operates through the elixir field [i.e. the centre] and circulates it equally throughout on the body - up, down, right and left, this [movement of ki] corresponds to the movement [of ki] in the universe. Thus without deliberately intending it, one becomes endowed with 1 U / Eisei 3:164-165. 1 0 8 Sakade 1999, 54-55. 133 mysterious refinement and transformative virtue.1 0 9 Abdominal breathing (microcosm) is likened to the circulation of ki within the universe (macrocosm). The association of spirituality with abdominal ki seems to resonate with the views of Durckheim, who as we have seen, maintains that spiritual power resides in the abdomen. Secondly, it is characteristic of Bydka suchi to recommend that controlling and calming the breath in the abdomen can cure various diseases. As for all those people who have chronic diseases, when going to sleep, they should in particular calm the mind, banish any thoughts, and concentrate on the area under the navel being replete with ki. The efficacy of going to sleep like this is often far greater than ordinary medicines.1 1 0 When combined with abdominal massage for enhanced efficacy, regulating the breath in the abdomen can be a panacea for kart -fi (Bydka suchi defines it as various disorders related to the mind)1 1 1 , stiff shoulders, flushing, dizziness, blockages in the chest and the stomach, depressed mind, shaku (congealed clump), colic, stomach convulsions, women's blood-related diseases and so on\".1 1 2 According to Tanaka (1993, 1996), it was Yasen kanna PIUS' (1757) by Hakuin 1 = 3 i^, a Rinzai Zen priest, that propagated the idea of abdominal breathing as a \"cure-all\" in Edo yojo theory. 1 1 3 The method of Hakuin, which combines Zen 1 0 9 Eisei 3:155. 1 1 0 BS 1:12. 1 1 1 For the definition of kan, see section on \"massage\". 1 1 2 BS 1:11. 1 1 3 Tanaka 1993, 51-72. Tanaka Satoshi 1996, Kenkdho to iyashi no shakaishi (Seikyusha, Tokyo), 50-51. 134 seated meditation and breath regulation, is famously known as the \"soft butter ^ S^\"method, One imagines that soft butter is placed on one's head, and the butter is melting and running down, and soaking into one's body. This is a method of controlling the downward movement of ki to the elixir field through visualisation.1 1 4 Deep breathing in the elixir field cures \"all kinds of sufferings\" and can be more effective than any medicines. After the Edo period, many health manuals endorsing such meditation methods as a \"cure-all\" appeared in the Meiji, Taisho, and Showa eras (i.e. well into the 20th century). Often inspired by Yasen kanna , they focus equally on cultivating the abdomen as the centre of life. For instance Fujita Reisai IS 15 Half (1868-1957) and Niki Kenzo \" yfcfSH (1873-1966) established their own seated meditation and abdominal breathing methods. In particular, the method of Okada Torajiro [5 * 3 \u00a3 [$ meditation method |f f i] was widely practised at the beginning of the twentieth century.1 1 5 The cultivation of the abdomen as a panacea in Bydka suchi evidently also belongs to the same lineage as Yasen Kanna. In Yojoketsu , Hirano Jusei mentions that he learnt the art of abdominal cultivation from Shirai Kyusu who mastered the secrets of Zen from a pupil of Hakuin.1 1 6 In other words, Jusei became a de facto inheritor of Hakuin's method in the fourth generation of the lineage of transmission. The abdominal breathing methods of the Edo period were in turn 1 1 4 Eisei 2:240-241. 1 1 5 Tanaka claims that after the Meiji Restoration, the leaders of the Japanese government, developed a complex about the Japanese physique, and launched a campaign to rebuild the Japanese body on the model of \"Western\" masculinity. In the national movement to re-imagine the body, opinion about the significance of the abdomen began to waver. However as one of the reactions against this form of Westernisation, some Japanese chose to revive abdominal power as an emblem of traditional body cultivation. A number of health methods sprang into being and then disappeared around the turn of the nineteenth century, some of which involved mysticism or dubious hypnotism. Proponents often maintained that a mysterious spiritual power lodges in the abdomen. Tanaka 1993,148-178. 1 1 6 Eisei 3:167-168. 135 passed on to later generations who practised them as a cure-all and for purposes of spiritual cultivation in the Meiji, Taisho, and early Showa times. Therefore when we look at the development of breath regulation in yojo texts during and after the Edo period, it highlights the position of Bydka suchi (and Yojoketsu ) in the long lineage of emphasis on the abdomen in Japanese culture. 2-3-3. Konare : digestion It seems most appropriate to translate konare in Bydka suchi as \"digestion\", for this best reflects both the various Chinese characters with which konare makes compounds and the contexts in which the term is used (Table 10). We may think of \"digestion\" as a physiological process that breaks down food and drink into substances that can nourish the body. In addition to this definition, however, konare in Bydka suchi further alludes to the central bodily function, which is crucial in considering the mechanisms of life. It should be noted that the chart below gives a list of various homonyms of konare written with different Chinese characters in Bydka suchi . The left column lists the Chinese characters to which the reading konare is appended. The middle column shows the literal meaning of the corresponding Chinese characters in order to highlight different nuances. The right column gives the context in which each instance of konare appears in Byoka suchi . This survey suggests the possibility that the author Hirano Jusei deliberately matches the word konare with particular Chinese characters, in full consciousness of the konare effect generated by their combination. For instance, he often uses f t in the context of digesting something that is (in his view) indigestible, such as rice cakes or glutinous rice products. From this example, it may be possible to claim that Hirano intends to emphasise the \"converting\" aspect of digestion, from a sticky or hard 136 substance to nourishment. On the other hand, ih appears in a discussion of the movement of ki of the body, rather than the digestion of food. Thus the chart shows that konare in Bydka suchi takes on diverse meanings depending on the context, as we shall argue in this chapter.

Characters and literal meaning of konare 137 Short history of konare First of all let us briefly trace the meaning of the word konare through history. This is a noun which is cognate with the transitive verb konasu . The definition in Kogo daijiten (Dictionary of Japanese Archaisms) explains that its initial meaning is \"to grind, to pulverise, to cultivate\". This relates to the literal meaning of kona, powder, as konasu can be divided into kona (powder) + su (a word to indicate action).1 1 7 According to the Dictionary o f the Origins ofJapanese , the element ko of konare developed in the order of: M (to go beyond)\u2014 k F (child)\u2014 /h (small)\u2014 ^ (to cook or to ripen).1 1 8 This seems to echo the shift in meaning that the term konare would later undergo. This interpretation, which had already emerged in ancient records, is supported by contemporary linguistic analysis. For instance, there is a kind of Japanese glossary, usually called Setsuydshu that appeared before the Edo period and prevailed as the prototype for many later dictionaries. The Irin edition ( Irin setsuydshu explains the character M (to disturb) or f t (to farm) as synonymous with konasu.1 1 9 The second meaning of konasu is 4 t:o knead\". Nippo jisho (Japanese-Portuguese dictionary), compiled by a Jesuit missionary in the sixteenth century CE, defined it as \" wheat, or to bake bread\"1 2 0 7 Yamanaka Jota 1976, gogen jiten (Hasekura, Tokyo), Konasu can similarly be discomposed into: ko /h (small) + na \u00a9 I j (mild) + su (a word indicating action) in this context. Todo Akiyasu (ed) 1984, Nihon gogen jiten (Gendai shuppan, 1 9 Irin setsuydshu (12th century CE) kanchi'in Atsuo Nippo jisho , Jesuit reprint translated and Tadao (et al.) (Iwanami, Tokyo), 145-146. Nippo jisho evora bon de Iapam), Annotated by Otsuka Mitsunobu in 1998, Seibundo, Osaka, 146. 138 From the Edo period onwards, the interpretation of konare began to change slightly. In Wakun no shiori, konare is explained as \"to mature f!||&\" 1 2 1 Also in Genkai (The ocean of language, Otsuki Fumihiko 1904), one of the most classic and authoritative dictionaries of Japanese, which was repeatedly published, the author speculates that konaru , the intransitive verb corresponding to konare, originally derived from konaru written with the characters -5. Then he defines it as follows: \"(1) to be ground into a powder, to be reduced to tiny pieces ^ # , (2) to become mature and mixed, narete mazaru ^ and (3) of foods, to be dissolved in the stomach, i.e. digested shoka f${b\".1 2 2 The significant point here is that konare came to mean \"to simmer or mature\", which appears to reflect the denotation of S& , and it further evolved to denote \"digestion\". In fact a survey of Edo-period materials tells us that konare was the commonest term for digestion. To summarise, the field of reference of konare had come to be represented by the combination of \"grinding and simmering\", and it was then extended to include digestion. This short semantic discussion suggests that konare - a term for digestion in the Edo-period literature - could easily evoke the process of \"grinding and simmering\" foods in the body. Images of digestion: millstone and cauldron We find that Bydka suchi likens the weakened stomach of the sick person to a worn-out millstone, and admonishes the carer to lessen the amount of food given to the patient. 1 2 1 Wakun no shiori , vol. 2, 27. 1 2 2 Otsuki Fumihiko (ed) 1904, Genkai, (reprint 1911, Yoshikawa Kobunkan, Tokyo), 356. 139 This is because die sick usually find that their abdominal (hara no uchi) condition has declined and they lose the taste for food and drink. Thus if you force food on them in excessive amounts, it is obvious that it will stagnate and cause harm. It is like putting too much cereal onto a worn-out millstone $ > (D%\\\\fc < 5 0 (me no tsuburetaru usu ) and trying to grind it by force.1 2 3 This short passage already contains two similes for digestion: grinding and simmering. In the former case, digestion is explicitly compared with grinding food with a millstone. The latter is implicit in the expression for \"the inner abdomen\" (hara no uchi a storehouse for simmering the uncooked.) Although the furigana 'hara no uchV simply indicates \"the inner abdomen\", the Chinese characters evoke the Idea of simmering: dfe (uncooked) + ^ (to simmer) + Ml (storehouse).1 2 4 These two motifs frequently appear in an Edo-period context. For instance, Ydjdben incorporates the sense of grinding into its explanation of the digestive process: \"Digesting (konaru ^< 5 ) foods is in fact an abbreviation of grinding things into a powder h tl< 5 kona ni narareru ). Likewise not-digesting (konarenu ^tb\u00a3& ) is the abbreviation unable grind into powder (\u00a9 (\u00a3& ibtlifo kona ni nararenu)\"} 2 5 A 2 6 on healthy living, Inshoku yojo kagami (Rules o f dietary life), literally embodies these ideas (Illustration 4). The picture, assumed to have been produced around 1850 by the artist Utagawa Kunisada i$Cjil[lM (1786-1864), envisions the inner body of a man. 1 2 3 BS 1:44. 1 2 4 is also read \" yoku nietaru (well-cooked)\", BS 2:15, 1 2 5 Eisei 3:212. 1 2 6 Ukiyo-e (pictures of the floating world picture) is a genre of multi-coloured woodblock print pictures that flourished during the Edo period. 140 Shirasugi (2001) distinguishes a twofold intention in this. One is to show how the five viscera and the six entrails function, and the other is to caution against the dangers of excess in eating and drinking.1 2 7 A group of workmen reside in each organ, working ceaselessly to keep the body operating healthily. A stone mill represents the function of the liver. The note on the liver says: \"The role of the liver is digesting food. It is appointed as the general, who digests all the food and drink here by devising a plan\". Finely ground food is next transported to the spleen to be cooked in a huge cauldron over the fire there, and the vital essence made by this process nourishes the five viscera and the six entrails. In the conversation of the workmen in the spleen we find: \"It is about time to be careful with fire now\". In Bydka suchi , konare J s connotations of \"simmering\" are simply reflected in the use of the compound hara ho uchi 4 : 1 ^ 0 (inner abdomen). However it was more common in other yojo texts of the Edo period, including the Inshoku yojo kagami , to employ the image of \"fire\", which heats the cauldron where food is cooked in the spleen. Ydjdben uses an extended simile of cooking to portray digestion. 1 2 7 It forms a pair with Boji yojo kagami (Rules o f Sexual Life ), which envisions the inner organs of a courtesan, and admonishes against excessive sexual intercourse. Shirasugi 1999, 31-49. 141 Illustration 4. Inshoku yojo kagami (Rules of dietary life) (Copyright: International Research Center for Japanese Studies, Kyoto) 142 Digesting food can be compared to cooking rice. The spleen and stomach are just like a cauldron, the yang ki of the spleen and stomach is like burning firewood, and the daily consumption of food and drink is like putting water and rice in the cauldron. In order to prevent illnesses, it is most essential not to dampen the yang ^-firewood of the spleen and stomach (Ydjdben)1 2 8 . Despite the fact that Five Phases theory correlates spleen and stomach with earth, it is perhaps easy to associate fire iK (hi) with the spleen 1$ '(hi)-as they are homophones in Japanese.1 2 9 The image of fire probably originates in traditional Chinese physiology, particularly sanjiao YLM. Jiao literally indicates \"burner\", but it is more appropriate to understand sanjiao (three burners) as referring to three functions of the body rather than physical sites.1 3 0 For instance, the account of digestion in the chapters of 'wuwei 3jL^', 'xieke and 4 yingweishenghui can be summarised as follows: When one takes food or drink, it goes first to the stomach, which is called '\"the ocean of the five viscera and six entrails\"1 3 1 . Fine qi essence extracted from food and drink is then divided into structural rongqi and protective weiqi and they are transported from the stomach to the other organs. Muddy weiqi, sent out by the upper jiao _ k ^ (shangjiao), runs outside the vessels and circulates through the whole body. It warms and moistens the skin and flesh, and also defends the body from 1 2 8 Ydjdben , kohen chu tip, 38. 1 2 9 Suwen 'zhicongronglun 551. Unschuld 1985, 177-179. Both Wang Bing (762) and Yang Shangshan tH-hH interpret \"the storage of earth, wood, and water\" in Huangdi Neijing Suwen as the spleen, liver, and kidney in that order. Note that this not what one would expect from the usual Five Phases view, which would correlate spleen/stomach with earth. For the physiology of sanjiao , see Sivin 1987,124-131. 1 3 1 Lingshu, 'wuwei 3 1 ^ ', 134-136. 143 external evil. Meanwhile pure rongqi, sent from the middle jiao ( zhongjiao) where it is distilled as liquid and coloured red, runs into mai He (the vessels) as blood. Inside the vessels it composes blood, whereas outside the vessels it runs through the crevices of the organs, carrying nourishment throughout the body. Afterwards clear zongqi which is concerned with breathing, and excrement are further separated from rongqi and weiqi. It is difficult to fathom the actual nature of sanjiao , or the triple jiao or burner, which is classified as one of the six fu (entrails), and consists of the upper jiao, the middle jiao, and the lower jiao I 'M (xiajiao ). These three divisions do not. correspond to any particular organs. Rather, they are defined in terms of function, being in charge of the transport of the qi obtained from eating and drinking. Sometimes the function of the lower jiao, mainly excretion, is represented by the names of all three jiao, but generally, the term triple jiao is used in comprehensive reference to the digestive function. Ishida (1992) demonstrates that each jiao corresponds to one of the three steps of the digestive process, which are symbolised by the image of three torches M or three sickles They are \"to diffuse the tastes of the grains and extract qF in the upper jiao, \"to fumigate the remaining qi and transport it to the lung vessel to change it into blood\" in the middle jiao, and \"to convert what is left over into bodily qi and excrement\" in xiajiao, Ishida claims that sanjiao implies the archaic Chinese view that food and drink are converted and absorbed by the power of fire and heat.1 3 2 Images of the cauldron in yojo texts and references to the abdomen as \"a storehouse to simmer the uncooked in Bydka suchi all echo the idea of heat or fire. As well as similarities, however, there are some differences between Bydka 1 3 2 Yamada 1999 b, 414-420, and Ishida 1992,166-170. 144 suchi and many of the other Edo-period yojo texts in the account they give of the digestive process. For one thing, Bydka suchi rarely mentions the concept of ki in reference to digestion. Nourishment, fine qi essence, is often described in Bydka suchi as uruoi (moisture), which is appended as furigana to such terms''as $\u00a3$\u00a3 (nourishing liquid) and MIS (oily liquid), thus stressing its physical aspect. Apart from the treatment of qi (ki), two main features further stand out in Bydka suchi : the absence of specific digestive organs and the emphasis on movement. The absence of digestive organs Firstly, Bydka suchi rarely specifies particular organs for digestion. It is usually the spleen and stomach which play the central role in the digestive function in the Edo-period medical context. For instance Chomei eiseiron states: \"The spleen and stomach are the origin of life, and they receive all foods and digest them. Thus the crux of dietetics lies in not damaging the spleen and stomach\".1 3 3 Similarly, most yojo texts of the Edo period write of the spleen and stomach as the organs which play the central role in digestion, and some associate them with the image of the millstone: Ydjdben pictures digestion as the process of grinding food within the stomach. \"The membranes of the inner stomach are long and vertical, with bumpy protuberances. When food enters the stomach, it is these protuberances that grind it\".1 3 4 This probably indicates gastric protuberances, and suggests that the author had a knowledge of anatomy. On the other hand Shokujikai (Admonitions on diet, by Takai Ranzan 1815) says that \"the spleen, which is located above, 1 3 3 Chomei eiseiron, jo _h, 16. 1 3 4 Ydjdben, shohen jo J:, 14. 145 and the stomach, which resides below, are two layers and move round against each other so as to digest food, like millstones grinding things into powder\".1 3 5 The significance of these two organs reflects the influence of Chinese medical tradition, particularly the physiology and pathology of Li Gao's (1180-1251) Piweilun M B fra (Treatise of the spleen and stomach). Li Gao, himself drawing on the theory of Zhang Yuansu firstly combines the theory of inner organs and jingluo (vessels) with pharmacology. Secondly, he emphasises the importance of carrying out treatment in order to establish balance and thus expel external pathogenic influences .1 3 6 His medical scheme centres on vital essence (yuanqiigenki ) as the basis of human life, and he regards the spleen and the stomach as the source of that vital essence. He considers that diseases are caused by the combination of inner damage and outer evil The former represents sickness of the inner body, while the latter refers to changes in the outer world. However, outer evil is also allowed to invade the body by the depleted state of inner qi; thus the main rationale of prevention and treatment is to replenish inner qi. Li Gao maintains that it is the spleen and the stomach that nurture this inner qi, which also plays the central role in digesting food and nourishing the body. Accordingly, the fundamental principle of nurturing vital essence lies in the circulation of the qi of the spleen and stomach; so in order to nurture vital essence, it is necessary to maintain the circulation of the qi of spleen and the stomach, which comes from food and drink.1 3 7 The spleen and stomach are the place where the heavenly yang qi which Eisei 2:207. 1 3 6 For instance, Zhang Congzheng (1156-1228) employed three therapeutic techniques for the expulsion of pathogenic influences 3$ (xie), namely emetics, sweating and purgation IT fchT. ff-tilo H Piweilun, by Li Gao (reprint Zhonghua shuju, 1985), 'piweixushizhuanbianlun 2. 146 composes man accumulates; and there, too, earthly yin qi is refined into a beneficial substance (the finest kind of which is called jing Jj#).1 3 8 As to the circulation of qi, it is the ascent of qi that determines the existence of vital essence itself. Therefore the medicine of Li Gao focuses on achieving this ascent of qi in the spleen and'stomach. Rising qi implies that the qi of the spleen and stomach is in harmony, whereas descending qi indicates that it is disturbed. What is particularly to be feared is that the ascent of qi could cease. Corresponding fire filA ( xianghuo ), blazing up from xiajiao (lower burner) to envelop the heart ( xinbaoluo ), is regarded as an obstacle to this upward movement. Diseases are mostly manifestations of the inner damage Pel'll that is brought about by corresponding fire l i A , called yin fire [^ A .1 3 9 Li Gao's theory of the spleen and stomach was introduced to Japan, where it exerted a strong influence over Edo-period physicians.1 4 0 Ydjdkun maintains, in the opening statement of the section on dietetics: The five fu (entrails) start with the kidneys, and after a man is bom, the spleen and stomach form the basis of the five fu. When one takes food and drink, it is the spleen and stomach that receive and digest the food and drink, and send their fine essence to the other fu and zang. The other fu and zang receive nourishment from the spleen and stomach, just as trees and plants are nourished by the soil they grow in. Therefore the crux of cultivating life lies first and foremost in regulating the spleen and stomach1 4 1 . 1 3 8 Takizawa2001, 63-64, 177-179. Ishida gB& L S fe Piweilun , 3. 1 4 0 In contrast, works such as Inshokuyojo kagami and Wakan sansai zue assign the central role in digestion to the liver. Shirasugi argues that this schema was also a common one in the literature of the Edo period. Shirasugi 2001,31-49. 1 4 1 Yojokun , 64. 147 It is unlikely that Hirano Jusei was unaware of the prevalent physiology of the time, as outlined above. However instead of the spleen and stomach, \"the intestines and stomach U\u00a7W\" frequently appear in the context of digestion. In the eighth fascicle of Bydka suchi , these organs are explained thus: \"The stomach (inofu ) only stores food and drink, and transports them to the entrails J U \u00a7 (harawata), where they gradually turn into excrement and exit from the anus\".1 4 2 \" If inofu \" refers to the stomach. M can be understood literally as the intestines, but the furigana harawata indicates, rather, the entrails in general. However we should note that references to the stomach and entrails by specific names occur only a few times throughout the eight fascicles of Bydka suchi. 1 4 3 It may therefore be said that konare digestion in Bydka suchi is not concerned with where the process takes place but how it is carried out. The lack of references to the spleen and stomach in Bydka suchi is rather unusual for an Edo-period yojo text. However this may reflect the statement from the Chinese classic Suwen : \"The stomach is the ocean where water and grains are sent to... while the six fu (entrails) do not store foods but transmit and convert them.\"1 4 4 On the other hand, the spleen and stomach are said to be used for \"the storage of cereals\".1 4 5 Suwen explains that digestion is the process of \"transporting and converting\" foods by the six fu. This seems to suggest why Bydka suchi emphasises the intestines and stomach, two of the fu, and their movement. This ^ BS 8:4. 1 4 3 BS 8:3-4. 1 4 4 Suwen 503. 1 4 5 Suwen, 'linglanmidianlun 58. 148 preference for the intestines and stomach is perhaps because the spleen and stomach are described as a storage area, which does not evoke the image of movement. Emphasis on movement * The second feature of konare (digestion) in Bydka suchi is the stress on k o n a r e k o n a r e \"movement\". This is manifested in the compounds listed in Figure 22: a t e , a n , k o n a r e k o n a r e k o n a r e k o n a r e k o n a r e hsni no konare ftfii, f t f t , jlifb, f t f t , ft(b , and f t f t . Evidently, this shows that digestion \"transports\" food and drink as nourishment to the whole body. The idea itself is not unusual, but the furigana in Bydka suchi further suggest how vital digestion is for life. \"Digestion\" is linked with \"circulation\" and \"body\" by appending different furigana to the same Chinese characters (transport). Figure 13: iU ft (digestion) \u2014 > l i f t (circulation) \u2014 (body) These three compounds well epitomise the author's view. \"Digestion\" is the process of \"circulating\" nourishment from food and drink throughout the body, and it is precisely this circulating movement that maintains the life of the body as an organic entity. In contrast to other yojo texts which find significance in preserving the spleen and stomach, the focus of Bydka suchi turns to movement within the body rather than the function of each organ. Unlike Ydjdben and Shokujikai, which associate gastric protuberances with digestion in conjunction with the movement of spleen and stomach, similes of millstones and simmering are no more than mere similes in Bydka suchi , Apparently, Bydka suchi accounts for the digestive process by its function, i.e., transporting food, and does not set out to reveal the roles of the inner organs or where digestion takes place. As the interlinked compounds of iU ft 149 (transport) and M W (intestines and stomach) show, hara (abdomen) is treated as the place where digestion takes place, although these compounds do not necessarily indicate the abdomen as a specific part of the body but rather the body itself or the interior of it: \" konare karada korada j i a r a hara Figure 14: \u2014 M W -+ MW Inside \u2014 * Inner organs 1 * 3 jfe When animals and birds become pregnant... they keep busy taking care of lunula konare themselves, thus the body's digestion ( SI CO'M'it) is good. They do not have to worry about how they will fare in childbirth, thus there is no ki depression. Therefore their delivery is very easy.1 4 6 Konare implies more than digestion as a physiological process of changing food and drink into substances that can be absorbed into the body. Rather, konare often refers to the smooth functioning of the body as a whole. The link between these ideas karada n o kotiareru k a r a d a o hatarakasa is evident in two compounds: IS (D'MWl and ^ 3 1 8 Kj . According to the furigana , the former means \"the body becomes digested\", while die latter means \"to work the body\". However the literal meaning of both compounds is the same, i.e. \"bodily exercise\". Finally the significance of movement in digestion is accentuated by the fear of stagnation. The fear of stagnation from eating is represented in Bydka suchi by the 1 4 6 BS 4:2. 150 symptoms called \"food damage\" JfelS. An examination of th e furigana for and related terms in Bydka suchi opens up interesting prospects for consideration.1 4 7 Furigana Chinese Characters Food damage Arrested foodStagnated foodStagnation Lodged food Shokusho k M / ^ k mm Shokutai M k m k \u00a3 ? # mm Shukushoku Tsukae m k Kuisugi m k Table 11. Food Damage in Bydka suchi The Japanese terms in the furigana column frequently form compounds with Chinese characters: shokusho for jfeHr (food damage), shokutai for (food stagnation), shukushoku for fi?4 (lodged food), tsukae for 0 x. (congestion), and kuisugi for (excessive eating). Let us see the pathology of each of the medical terms above, and how they are all interlinked by furigana. Firstly, Bydka suchi explains that food damage and food stagnation occur when one eats again before the previous meal has been dispersed\" 1 4 8 However Chinese medical tradition provides more details. According to the pathological text Yuanhoulun, food damage refers to a situation where the spleen becomes unable to digest food due to excessive eating. The breathing becomes rapid, and one writhes in agony and sleeps restlessly.1 4 9 1 4 7 Daidoji Keiko 2005, 'Edo no shokusho', in Suzuki and Ishiduka, 147-167. 1 4 1 'shishangbaohou , 632-633. 151 Secondly, Bydka suchi does not specify the pathology of lodged j . , . hitoyo toshi hetaru yamai the character M is used in such compounds as m (one night) and $3 m (longstanding illness), conveying the sense of \"long duration\". is therefore understood to be a state in which food remains lodged in the body for an extended period1 5 0 . According to Zhubing yuanhoulun , lodged food should be differentiated from food damage. The former is the state when the qi of the zang (viscera) becomes xu (empty, vacuous), and there is cold between the spleen and the stomach so that the body cannot digest food. If one consumes food again before the previous food has been dispersed, the food remains in the spleen and the stomach. This is because the qi of spleen and stomach is already depleted. The abdomen feels full and the breathing becomes rapid. The belches have an acid smell, and one is attacked by alternating chills and fever, which causes headache. It resembles intermittent fever $\u00a7 (niie).1 5 1 To the extent that food damage is seen as indigestion due to excessive eating, the view found in Bydka suchi deviates little from Chinese medical tradition. Nonetheless there are two main points of difference: Firstly, Bydka suchi does not mention the function of the spleen. Secondly, it neglects ki (qi) emptiness in the pathology of food damage and lodged food. During the Edo period, food damage was often conflated with stagnated food and lodged food. As Kagawa Shuan's Ippondo koyoigen explains, \" Shukushoku S A is commonly called shokutai in Japan\"1 5 2 . This suggests that shokutai was not exactly a medical term, but a popular expression for the heavy feeling that comes from overeating. BS 2: 7,13. 1 5 1 Yuanhoulun, 'sushibuxiaohou 629 \u2014 632. 1 5 2 Ippondo koyoigen, KKIS edition, vol. 65, 509-510. 152 Thirdly, tsukae is found in Shanghanlun in the sense of a small knot or congestion of qi beneath the breast.1 5 3 However, Bydka suchi links tsukae t s u k a e t s u k a e shokusho with stagnated food: Thus tsukae here implies food which is not digested and remains within the body. Fourthly, the term \"arrested food glossed as shokusho , in Ihotaiseiron gekai (Annotations of i \" is annotated as 'When foods stagnate, disperse the stagnation'\".1 5 4 Thus refers to the stagnation of food. Food damage, lodged food, and congestion each originally have a different pathology in Chinese medical texts. However the furigana of Bydka suchi efficiently interlink all these terms and render them all mutually convertible, binding them together by the notion of stagnation: Figure 5 ts u k a e t s u k a e shokusho shokusho Digestion converts food into nourishment in the abdomen, and transports it throughout the body. In other words, \"indigestion\" indicates that food does not move, shokusho t s u k a o which results in \"food damage\" i.e., stagnation This corresponds to the statement in Bydka suchi : \"As the ancients used to say, lodged food is the beginning 1 5 3 According to the annotation of al.), 1742. Reprint in 1982 (Renminweisheng, Beijing), 5 4 Iho taiseiron gekai, by Okamoto Ippo. KKIS edition, vol. 9, 342. 153 of various diseases. Of all diseases, eight or nine out of ten are caused by not regulating the desire of mouth and stomach\"1 5 5 . Hara is the area where digestion takes place, and the source of the motive force for the circulation of ki. It transports nourishment from foods and efficacy from medicine through the body.1 5 6 \"Digestion haranokonkre of the abdomen I \" is the core of organic activity, so that excessive or intemperate eating disturbs digestion. It results in the stagnation of foods and thus of the ki of the whole body, which may be the cause of all diseases. 2-3-4. Shaku and kori \u2014Congealed clump This is a tale of not so long ago. There was a man who taught reading and writing in the countryside who had always suffered from shaku When he was about to die, he told his children, pupils and neighbours, \"When I die, bum my body to ashes, and destroy the clump of shaku in my abdomen. This may sound unmanly in the face of death. But it will soothe the hard feelings of those who are suffering from the same disease\". After his death, according to his wishes, they burned his body and found something congealed among the bones. \"This must be the clump of shaku\". His pupils and all the others tried to smash it with an iron axe or stone, but in vain. ( Mimibukuro , vol. I)1 5 7 . Mimibukuro (1814) is a compilation of unusual and interesting anecdotes collected by Negishi Yasumori who worked for many years as a town 1 5 5 BS 2:36. 1 5 6 BS 1:44. 1 5 7 Tsuneo (Iwanami bunko, Tokyo), 32. 154 magistrate and commissioner of finance in the city of Edo. This anecdote shows that people in the Edo period considered shaku to be an actual hard clump in the abdomen, which continues to exist even after one's death. In Bydka suchU shaku is regarded as the root of many chronic diseases, and it is also claimed that various diseases such as syphilis or epilepsy will turn into shaku. In addition to shaku , Bydka suchi mentions in various places that one can find a congealed clump in the patient's body which is the core of a persistent pathogen. What produces this clump and why does it grow in the body? This section examines the pathology of the congelation or congealed clump, particularly shaku , in Bydka suchi and how it is interpreted in the Edo-period medical context. First of all, what is shaku ? During the Edo period shaku was known as a commonly experienced everyday ailment, identified by a congealed clump and painful spasms in the region of the lower abdomen. Despite its commonness, the experience of shaku gradually fell into extinction after the Meiji era. Nowadays medical historians suggest that shaku corresponds to such diseases as hysteria, gallstone, angina pectoris, and so forth.1 5 8 For instance, Kan-yo byomei taishoroku (Record of the correspondences between Chinese and Western disease names, by Ochiai Taizo -n, 1883) interprets Japanese diseases using English (or Latin) and Chinese names. In Ochiai's translation, shaku is broken down into several diseases. Thus, the Chinese-character names and correspond to liver cancer, hepatitis, hepatic congestion and infarction, and other liver diseases, while the Japanese term shaku is matched with gastric spasms or cardialgia.1 5 9 In this process of differentiated translation, the existence of shaku 1 5 8 Suzuki Akira 2000, Edo no iryo (Tokyodo, 1 (Oriento sha, Tokyo)12, 81, 82. 155 gradually became undermined. However the complexity of shaku as such lies in the term itself. Shaku originates in the ancient Chinese disease, ji (accumulation). The term ji is mentioned in Nanjing Ht$i, as an unmoving accumulation of qi in the abdomen, which is contrasted with a temporary and mobile lump ju M (gathering).1 6 0 Shaku is the Japanese reading of the Chinese character ji, and writers in the Edo period began to use a made-up character for shaku, which is a hybrid of H (accumulation) and f - (the radical for disease). But shaku in Edo-period Japan must be differentiated from its ancestor and Chinese counterpart ji. The perception of shaku during the Edo period is best referenced by Kuriyama (2004), who provides cultural and historical insights into the subject.1 6 1 According to him, shaku is distinguished from its ancestor ji mainly in two aspects. Firstly, the role of stagnant accumulations as a pathogen was often the central concern for Edo-period doctors, in contrast to Chinese ji which acquired hardly any major significance. For instance, Goto Konzan of the Classic School contends that \"All diseases arise from the stagnation of ki flow... nowadays many people have accumulations of ki no matter whether it pertains to fullness or emptiness. It becomes knotted in the abdomen, and the intestines and stomach are not in harmony, and ki and blood are not regulated\"1 6 2 . Doctors believed that the accumulation of ki was physically palpable in the abdomen, which enhanced the popularity of abdominal diagnosis in Edo-period medicine. 1 6 0 Huangti bashiyi Nanjing AH\u2014 $ \u00a7 $ > \u00a3 Yuqun Shenyang) 'shibanan -T 35 1 6 1 Kuriyama 2004,27-41. 1 6 2 Ikyo (1757 preface), compiled by pupils of Goto Konzan after his death. KKIS edition, vol. 13, 154-155. 156 Secondly, during the Edo period shaku prevailed not only as a diagnostic term but also as a favoured expression for complaining about illness in the everyday speech of laypersons: r' The hardened congelations in the abdomen became associated with accumulations at the core of the person as well as of the body... Explanations of its cause, moreover, came to include and accent the grievances of the heart, its frustrations and unfulfilled yearning. The disease began to resonate with overtones of acute pain and desire.1 6 3 In quite a few Edo-period literary works shaku is a manifestation of anger or frustration. For example a short poem contains the ironic line: \"Madam's shaku is because of mistress' vomiting\".1 6 4 The lady of the house is troubled by shaku when she finds out that a mistress seems to have morning sickness. Even nowadays an echo of this still remains in an expression like \"it touches my shaku \", which conveys irritation. As in many other Edo-period texts, the frequency of the term in Bydka suchi explicitly shows that shaku is one of the key symptoms in describing ill-health. Shaku creates a knot in the abdomen which blocks the free flow of the breath. It can be dispersed by daily training in breath-regulation. All the time just concentrate on the breath reaching below the navel, and abandon all other thoughts. While counting each time, breathe in and out through the nostrils without ever opening the mouth. Some of those who have a 1 6 3 Kuriyama 2004,29. 1 6 4 The original poem 157 predisposition to shaku ( shaku-ke ) say that the breath often becomes blocked where there is a clump, and it is difficult to make it reach below the navel. Yet if one tries hard and practises day after day, anyone will invariably be able to make the breath reach below the navel.1 6 5 ' In addition to breath-regulation, such practices as massage with chanting are recommended as effective for shaku. Not only the Chinese character for shaku> but also various Chinese-characterf/ttrigcwa compounds are employed in Bydka suchi . Each character in the Table evokes a different pathology of accumulation. Furigana Chinese Characters mm mm or Shaku in Bydka suchi 1 6 5 BS 1:16. 158 Examining the figure, one sees firstly that the Chinese characters St and are originally differentiated from shaku in terms of pathology. According to Zhubing yuanhoulun, there are two phenomena called zheng and jia if\u00ae that' become congealed and form clumps due to an imbalance between cold and warmth, indigestion from food and drink, and conflicts between evil qi and the qi of the organs. Zheng does not move, while jia moves if pushed with the hand.1 6 6 This definition is also followed in Edo-period medical texts such as Byomei ikai \u00ae M (Understanding of disease names, 1686) by Ashikawa Keishu M fil (seventeenth century). Zheng and jia in Chinese medicine do not originally occur in 1 fZ lthe abdomen, but in the chest. However Bydka suchi associates both of them jointly with the furigana \" shaku\" by virtue of their common feature of forming a knotted clump. Secondly, senki ftU M was one of the commonest everyday afflictions for Japanese people in the Edo period. It appeared with a sharp spasm of pain in the region from the lower abdomen to the groin, and in serious cases developed into painful swelling in the sexual organs. It is sometimes interpreted as colic, while in Kan-yo byomei taishoroku senki is, like shaku , dissected diseases such as enteritis or intestinal neuralgia, peritonitis, and renal 1 6 Rhyperaemia. It is impossible to conceive of senki as a single symptom, and just like shaku , senki is no longer experienced or talked of nowadays. From the viewpoint of medical and cultural history, Shirasugi (1997, 1999) concludes that the experience 1 6 6 Yuanhoulun , 'zhengjiahou 578. 1 6 7 Byomei Facsimile 1979. Contained 118. 1 8 Kan-yo bydmei taishoroku , 79, 81. 86. 159 of senki is primarily attributable to the pathology of accumulation.1 6 9 It was thought that the flow of ki circulation within the body became blocked due to senki. These diseases of the accumulation of ki fjf are now regarded as a culture-bound phenomenon with special resonances for that time. Kagawa Shuan contends:' It has been about a century since the country became stable. The whole nation is better off, and people have become lazy. They are inclined to warm themselves excessively and indulge in leisure. In the meantime, their mind is much troubled, their spirit is worn out from the accumulation of a century, and their heart is anxious about their livelihood. In addition they take food and alcohol greedily, and indulge themselves in sexual pleasure. In so doing how can the vital essence not be exhausted to the point of wasting one's life? Ki is so exhausted that ki transport cannot help but slow down, and it forms stagnation. Therefore no person today, whether noble or lowly, rich or poor, is free from knotted cho and sen Sf,1 7 0 Along with the dissemination of pathologies of accumulation and stagnation, sen came to be used as a synonym of ji fit and ju lil in an Edo-period medical 1 7 1context. Although in the Chinese medical view, ji and ju are not closely related, Bydka suchi often juxtaposes sen and shaku , suggesting that the two furigana are almost interchangeable. It seems that Bydka suchi links the conditions together by the common element of \"accumulation\" in sen and shaku. The various compounds in the Figure on shaku mainly indicate two features of the understanding of shaku in Bydka 1 6 Japanese Body in the Edo period', Otsuka, 63-72. 1 7 0 Ippondo koyoigen , edition, vol. 65, 'cho 129. 1 7 1 Shirasugi 1997, 75. 160 suchi: Firstly shaku is recognised by a tangible clump in the abdomen. Secondly shaku is understood to be a habitual and chronic affliction. Firstly, the furigana \"korF (stiffness) and \" katamari \" (clump) indicate that shaku is mostly recognised as an actual clump in the abdomen. shaku hara no katamari katamari kori kori katamari Figure 16: M m M M - > M M - * W f t . As shown in the compounds , or n, the process of growth of the clump is described as \"knotting and a passage by Kagawa Shuan elaborates on this image. He contends that the accumulation of bad ki grows day by day: At first it is almost indistinguishable. It gradually grows and accumulates till it reaches the size of a grain of rice, then a bean, a bullet, and an egg, and eventually becomes as big as a ball.1 7 2 Secondly in the Edo-period literature, shakuke or shakuki usually forms compounds with the Chinese characters {shaku nature), implying that shaku becomes so habitual as to be like a part of one's nature. The compounds (lodged congelation) and (lodged clump) also suggest that the symptoms are apt to be chronic. It implies the necessity for resignation to cope with the disease, just like the old man in Mimibukuro who lived with shaku for many years. What makes these clumps form? The examination of the causes of shaku in Bydka suchi suggests that not only physical substances like food and drink, but also states of mind and venereal diseases can cause stagnation and accumulation. When the pathogenic poison of syphilis or gonorrhoea strikes inward instead of being purged as pus or a swelling, it may congeal and turn into shaku . On the other hand, it 1 7 2 Ippondo koyoigen , KKIS edition, vol. 65, 'cho 125. 161 sometimes happens that shaku turns into beriberi, which is regarded as a self-inflicted disease due to intemperate eating or an idle lifestyle. This interpretation corresponds to the view of Kagawa that the increase in shaku and senki in the Edo period reflects the degeneracy of his contemporaries. Furthermore, negative bmotions like depression, melancholy or anger are very likely to result in ki congelation.1 7 3 This view of emotional accumulation is described by Goto Konzan in this way: \"Such illnesses are caused by stagnation. Eating and drinking also bring on stagnation. There are seven emotions that also provoke the stagnation of vital essence.\"1 7 4 The seven emotions are anger joy # , worry melancholy iE, sorrow S , fear iSf, and fright Generally speaking, in yojo teachings, excess in any emotion should be suppressed. Yet Bydka suchi particularly emphasises the harm done by negative feelings which are difficult to release and can easily accumulate within the person. In this sense, it is possible to say that shaku is the tangible trace of one's way of living thus far: intemperate and excessive eating and drinking, negative and introspective ways of thinking, and so forth. Kuriyama (1997) considers that the discourse of stagnation turned people's attention towards the past: What they thought, did, or should have done all accumulated in the body and gradually manifested as a congelation.1 7 5 Finally thus far, shaku has appeared as a persistent congelation in the abdomen which is chronic. Bydka suchi further contends that a few of the acute diseases also create transient knotted clumps in the body, which can be dispersed by strong pressure or massage, thereby soothing the acute attack. The sixth fascicle explains that one can find these knots in patients suffering from sleeping sickness, apoplexy, and convulsions. 1 7 3 BS 1 : 9,13,40,48, and 5: 2,4,42. 1 7 4 Ikyd, KKIS edition, vol. 13,154. 1 7 5 Kuriyama 1997, 48-52. 162 note samenu yamai In the case of sleeping sickness 8\u00a7 , one suddenly falls asleep without cause, and often dies before appropriate measures are taken. As first aid, Byoka suchi instructs that the reviving technique of the martial arts is effective: If one feels the shoulders of the patient, one can feel deep-rooted congelation sokofukoku kori katamari tarumono ^ M fc&'b<D, Take hold of it and break it up... If one finds a congealed knot in the region of the shoulders, backbone, and armpit, it should be rubbed firmly.1 7 6 In the case of apoplexy 0 , a congelation appears as one of the signs of an attack, often combined with such symptoms as flushing, dizziness, headache, tinnitus, kori stiff shoulders and stiffness in the ribs. A congelation is felt in the chest or hare armpit. According to Byoka suchi, apoplexy occurs when the abdomen MM (internal organs) rises up and put pressure on the heart. This pressure ascends and k o r i results in further blockage in the head. Massaging any congelation or ts u mari stiffness anywhere in the body is effective for dispersing this blockage M U in the head as well. Furthermore, many cases of apoplexy are initially induced by stagnated shokutai food or excessive drinking, which can be removed by phlegm or vomiting. Phlegm is particularly dangerous because it may choke the throat. It is noticeable that the signs, cause, and symptoms of apoplexy are often discussed in the discourse of stagnation or blockage, which is most distinctly recognised as congelation or stiffness when one lays one's hand on the abdomen. 1 /0 BS 6:9-11. 1 7 7 BS 6:11. 163 niwaka ni hikitsukeru yamai In the case of sudden fainting from convulsions -fr m , congelation is also sometimes found. When one comes into contact with poisonous ki or the body's circulation is disordered, one may suffer a fit of convulsions and fainting. A kori congelation JU iS lL is found in the shoulder region, and this should be massaged. At first sight, sleeping sickness, apoplexy, fainting due to convulsions seem to have no connection with each other. However in Byoka suchi , they are all categorised as kan IfS, diseases involving disturbance of the mind. Reflecting the literal meaning of the element f M j (space) in the Chinese character, kan is defined as a disease in which the soul becomes separated from the body. Thus the disease manifests in abnormal mental states, such as becoming unusually confused or alert, bad-tempered or oveijoyed, or depressed, or suicidal. In this way, various signs may appear. We may wonder why diseases related to the mind should form a congealed knot. This is probably based on the aetiology of \"retrocession H \"and \"knots M\"as described in Byoka suchi : Any excess of emotion, food or drink may be a potential cause of stagnation, not to mention the pathogenic poisons of various other diseases. If one fails to purge excesses or poisons at an early stage, or to disperse them by daily massage or other treatment, they are likely to invade the body more deeply, and gradually become knotted into a congelation or stiffness. This explains why venereal diseases sometimes result in shaku. As congelation disturbs ki transport in the body, the effects probably extend to the mental functions. Both sleeping sickness and fainting from convulsions affect consciousness; and such signs as uneasiness, bad temper, forgetfulness, and sleeplessness may be the prelude to a fit of apoplexy. It seems that using massage as first aid for these symptoms is intended to open up or penetrate the blockage, thereby promoting proper circulation within the body. 164 2-4. Dietary Instruction Eating is vital for life, a theme that is by no means neglected in Bydka suchi. While basic guidelines concerning diet, mainly focussed on temperate eating, are briefly presented in the first fascicle, the second fascicle is devoted entirely to dietary instruction and directs special advice to the sick. This fascicle sets forth the objections to eating animal meat, the significance of habitual eating and digestible foods, and the proper diet for the sick, and gives a list of foodstuffs from the viewpoint of their beneficial and harmful effects on various symptoms. In conclusion it states that it is difficult for lay people to distinguish the nature of foods and medicines; and for this reason recommends that decisions on this matter should be left to doctors. These topics involve several popular themes, found in dietary instructions in various Edo-period yojo texts. Firstly, meat-eating raises issues of digestion and/or the morality of frugal eating. Secondly, the focus on providing specific information about proper diet for the sick, so characteristic of Bydka suchi , means that foodstuffs are evaluated mainly on the basis of fear of stagnation. Thirdly, the idea of \"poison\" plays a key role in the classification of foodstuffs and the account of digestion. Thus this section will examine these three areas of dietetic concern in Byoka suchi in comparison with other Edo-period yojo texts. 2-4-1. Meat: Nourishing Food or Delicacy? Before the Meiji era, animal meat was not commonly consumed in Japan, apart from game and chicken. For instance Hitoyashinai mondo (Dialogue on 165 the Cultivation of Man, by Shibata Yusho 1715) emphasises the harmfulness of animal meat, as it causes \"accumulated fever in the spleen and stomach, and venereal scabies, or other malignant tumours\".1 Many other yojo texts take up the pros and cons of meat-eating, and the arguments mainly focu^ on two points: Firstly to what extent may one be allowed the pleasures of gourmet food? Secondly how does meat-eating fit into a good diet in terms of digestion and nutrition? Yojo teaching entails the fundamental assumption that plain food is most digestible and most suitable for a frugal way of life, but during the Edo period controversy regarding this assumption multiplied as time went by. Byoka suchi does not recognize any necessity for meat-eating, primarily from the viewpoint of nutrition and digestion. Quoting the statement from Lunyu7, \"do not let meat conquer the ki of food (grain)\", Byoka suchi contends that because animal meat is fatty and spoils easily, excessive meat-eating invariably disturbs the digestion, and causes stagnation in the abdomen.3 Yojokun speaks in similar terms of the problems attached to digesting animal meat: \"Do not eat meat much. Do not eat raw meat frequently. They easily stagnate.\" 4 It can be said that these arguments differentiate good and bad foodstuffs on the basis of their physical nature. As an alternative argument against the excessive consumption of animal flesh, Yojokun proposes that the Japanese are different from the Chinese or Koreans in constitution: \"Animal meat is not suitable for the Japanese whose intestines and stomachs are less strong than those of the Chinese or Koreans\".5 Rather than constitutional differences, Byoka suchi insists that differences in food quality are the reason for stagnation: The 1 Eisei 5: 58. 2 The original text Lunyu SSJZS Yojokun, 65, 5 Yojokun, 74. 166 reason that more Japanese people suffer from food stagnation than Chinese or other foreigners is that the Japanese rice and rice wine {sake) are stronger in flavour and more nourishing.6 This point brings to mind the loyalty to Japanese products that Hirano expresses elsewhere as an author of national history, in Kokoku Icaibyaku yuraiki (The record of national origins since the beginning) and Tenjitsushiben (Discussion of the successor of the sun). There is yet another ground of objection to animal meat, which is often cited in other yojo texts: Japan had a long tradition of considering animal meat to be ritually impure. Harada (2004) attributes this deep-rooted view to early government policies from around the eighth to the eleventh century, when meat-eating was prohibited at certain times of the year in an attempt to promote agriculture. The notion of rice being \"holy\" and meat \"impure\" gradually grew up as a consequence of this. For instance, Shokujikai mentions that the meat of animals with four legs should be avoided in the Shinto religion.7 Rojin hitsuyo yashinaigusa also describes animal meat as \"low\", which means that humans should not eat it. In particular, they should not eat beef, because it is against benevolence to kill domestic animals that assist Dwith human agriculture. Although this idea of the impurity of meat was widespread among the population, in reality meat-eating was widely practised, mainly among the middle and lower classes of society.9 Hirano himself in Byoka suchi flatly rejects the idea of impurity, though in his case, he attributes it to Buddhism or humanism. If the eating of living creatures must be prohibited, there should be no distinction between birds, animals, fish and shellfish. Thus one cannot be 6 BS 2:1-2. 7 Eisei 2:214. 8 Eisei ga yutaka na [shoku] o unda', in Harada, 12. 167 prohibited from eating animal flesh alone, without prohibiting fish and fowl. Is it not evident that meat-eating is naturally prohibited by the divine sense with which each person is endowed? It is prohibited because greasy things are not good for the body. Even for those who are robust and free from illness, the harm of over-nourishment should be feared, if they indulge themselves to excess in eating meat, not only animal flesh but also fish or poultry.1 0 The issue for him does not lie in impurity or the value of life in other species, but in the fear of stagnation in the human body, no more and no less. Noting that \"there is nothing wrong with eating animal meat in regions where fish is in short supply\"1 1 , Hirano allows that, in terms of nutrition, animal meat can be an alternative to fish. What really matters is digestion. To sum up, Bydka suchi expresses disapproval of animal meat for its strong flavour, but not out of concern for the Japanese constitution or for reasons of impurity. The real issue is whether or not one can digest it. Thus as long as one is habituated to animal meat, there should be no reason to refrain from it. Furthermore, unlike many other yojo texts, Bydka suchi does not discuss meat-eating from either an ascetic or an epicurean standpoint. This is not the case in Yojokun , which, in addition to the problems of digestion, warns that meat may threaten the moral value of frugality: \"One should be temperate in meat-eating, because it is rich and flavoursome\".1 2 Nonetheless Yojokun does not entirely reject the enjoyment of fine foods in daily life, only claiming that one should eat them in moderation, to satisfy one's appetite and curiosity \"eighty or ninety 1 ^percent\". This moderate asceticism sometimes contrasts with attitudes in other 1 0 BS 2:2-3. 1 1 BS 2:2. 1 2 Yojokun, 74. 1 Yojokun M 0 $5 (The Immortal's method of prolonging life, author unknown, 1695) is more strict in its objections and completely repudiates fine foods: \"We have never had so many delicacies in the world as we have now. If people are lost in desire, they crave delicacies. People who are fond of sumptuous foods age fast and their lives are short.\"1 4 Yojo shichifuka i t rT (Seven prohibitions in cultivating life, Sugita Genpaku # f i, 1801) also claims that \"food and drink are not to be savoured and enjoyed, but should be eaten and drunk just in order to nourish the body\".1 5 As time went by, however, the insistence on a frugal diet began to wane. This became a general trend in the early nineteenth century, when some yojo texts appeared which were more lax or lenient about sumptuous foods, asserting that there is nothing wrong with eating what one enjoys. Yojo bukuro (Packet of cultivating life, Ogawa Kendo /hi f I HI31, 1818) contends: You do not need to trouble your mind or worry about what is good and what is not. There are no poisonous foods among those that are habitual to your intestines and stomach. As the popular saying has it, there is no harm in one's favourite things.1 6 Ydjoben also states that \"all foods [are acceptable], as long as you find them tasty, they suit your stomach, and there is no poison in them.\"1 7 This tendency probably reflects developments in food culture. During the Edo period, various new recipes and foodstuffs became available to people in urban areas, due to increases in 1 4 Eisei 6:93. 1 _h, 14. 169 agricultural productivity, improvements in the transportation network, the development of the fishing industry and the manufacture of seasonings and alcoholic beverages, and so forth. On the other hand, people in rural areas lived in almost constant fear of famine, which, of course, from time to time had a drastic iiiipact on the life of the urban population as well.1 8 With changes in availability, rather than advocating the complete suppression of one's appetites, dietary instructions began to permit to a certain extent the pleasure of eating, thereby providing a framework within which one was at liberty to enjoy oneself.1 9 2-4-2. Dietary cautions for the sick: against overeating The significance of diet for the sick is encapsulated in the following statement in Bydka suchi : \"Nursing comes first, food second and medicine third. This being the case, except for acute diseases, it is indispensable to regulate one's eating and drinking, rather than hastening to take medicine\". Dietary treatment is the responsibility of the patient's attendants, presumably (female) family members. Thus more than half of the second fascicle of Bydka suchi is devoted to a discussion of diet for the sick. It discusses the merits and demerits of each foodstuff for various symptoms, while imparting general alimentary rules for healthy people. Wasabi (Japanese horseradish) has the efficacy of restoring abdominal digestion, curing stomach ache, and relieving depression. There is no need to prohibit it to those with any kinds of illnesses. It is recommended that the sick eat it daily as a 1 8 Takagi Kazuo 1997, Shoku kara mita 2 0 BS 2:1. 170 medicine for blood-related illnesses, depressive illnesses, and paralytic diseases.2 1 Bydka suchi primarily evaluates foodstuffs according to whether or not they are easily digestible. This emphasis on digestion is shared with most Edo-period yojo texts, not only for the sick but also for the healthy. However the dietary advice given in Bydka suchi differs from that of other major texts in not associating digestion with the theory of spleen and stomach put forward by Li Gao, which had wide currency in the medicine of the Edo period. The typical Edo-period dietary guidelines call for replenishment of the spleen and stomach, two of the chief digestive organs. So what is good for the spleen and stomach? Yojokun , for instance, specifically lists the foods that are inappropriate for the spleen and stomach. They include \"[foods that are] raw, cold, tough, sticky, dirty and impure, foul smelling, insufficiently cooked.\" Also \"foods that have lost their flavour from overcooking, foods left out for a long time after having been cooked, unripe fruit, things that have lost their flavour because of being too old, things unbalanced in the five flavours, greasy [things], and [things with] a strong taste.\"2 2 In contrast, Bydka suchi is basically critical of the majority of classifications that lay down the nature, flavours and efficacy of foodstuffs for dietary therapy, < % !calling them \"empty theories that clutch at shadows\". Furthermore Bydka suchi contends that discriminating the flavours or thermostatic nature of foods, most typically hot, cold, warm and cool, is very difficult for lay people. The nature of the food should not overwhelm the vital energy of the living body. For this reason, Hirano Jusei does not hide his suspicion of dietary taboos regarding food 2 1 BS 2:31. 2 2 Yojokun , 76. 2 3 BS 2:8. 171 combinations, which were one of the most popular topics in Edo-period dietary instruction. For instance, Chomei eiseiron lists such taboos as \"do not eat white snake with vegetables, as they are of the same kind\", \"do not combine mustard with chicken and carp\", and so forth.2 4 Food combination taboos are said to have their theoretical basis in the categorisation of flavours according to the theory of the Five Phases, whereby any combination of foods from the same category must be avoided. Bydka suchi does not entirely deny the credibility of combination taboos, but it criticises much of their content as unfounded.2 5 Instead of focusing on classifying the nature of foodstuffs, Bydka suchi first and foremost emphasises the danger of excessive eating. Any diet, whatever one eats, should be limited to seventy A /to eighty percent at most of what one desires. Finally, a comparison with the dietary instructions of the Hippocratic regimen may shed light on the fear of excessive eating expressed in Bydka suchi and other Edo-period yojo texts. The instructions of Hippocrates teach what to eat and how much to eat according to the changes of the four seasons. \"During the winter, one should eat as much as possible, drink as little as possible and this drink should be wine as undiluted as possible.\"2 7 In contrast, it is never the case in the Edo-period texts that one is allowed to eat as much as one pleases, whether one is healthy or not. In particular, Bydka suchi claims that the quantity of food for the sick should \"always\" be reduced to less than usual when the abdominal digestion is depleted. What is more, Bydka suchi warns the sick to avoid a heavy or greasy diet, as it is indigestible. This contrasts with the Hippocratic regimen, which instructs the sick that a light and frugal diet is harmful in case of chronic diseases. 2 4 Chomei eiseiron, jo 25-28. 2 5 BS 2:7. 2 6 BS 2:3. 2 7 GE.R. Lloyd (ed) 1950, Hippocratic Writings (Penguin, London, reprinted 1983), 272. 172 Sick people are in error when they take a light diet which only increases their distress. Then, whatever be wrong, they only become more ill on a light diet than they would on a slightly more substantial one. For this reason, light and frugal diets, when persisted in, are dangerous even for the healthy, because the undernourished do not bear an illness so well as the well nourished. Therefore, on the whole, light and frugal diets are more dangerous than those that are a little more substantial.2 8 When one is weakened by long illness, food provides the power to combat the disease. However, it seems that the dietary advice in Byoka suchi is primarily concerned with the potential dangers posed by food as the cause of stagnation. Of course the efficacy of dietary therapy is acknowledged, but more importantly, the patient's usual eating habits should be respected in time of illness. That is, the attendants should not strictly prohibit foods that the patient is used to eating as part of his or her normal daily diet, even if some of them are unbalanced in flavour. This contention is based on the belief that one's habitual diet, including the nourishment obtained from one's favourite foods, is beneficial to 'The innate function of the body\", which assists the natural healing process from within 2 9 One should just be careful not to exceed appropriate amounts, or to force the sick to eat foods they do not like. Forcing a person to eat brings no benefit, and it may upset the digestion and cause stagnation. For the same reason, although greasy and strong-tasting foods like animal meat are generally to be avoided, this is not always the case for those who are accustomed to them. All in all, rather than worrying about the idea of the \"nature\" of 2 8 Hippocratic Writings , 206-207. 2 9 BS 2:3-4. 3 0 BS 2:3. 173 foodstuffs, the best remedy is to give what the patient is used to and enjoys eating, just so long as this is not carried to excess. 2-4-3. Poison ' Byoka suchi expresses suspicion about the classification of foodstuffs as hot, cold, warm and cool. Instead it often describes the dangerous aspects of foods as \"poison\". A bonito fish is poisonous. The sick should never eat it. Even for healthy people, if they eat a lot of it, it does harm by perturbing the blood.3 1 Potatoes are not poisonous, but it is recommended that they should not be given to patients suffering from phlegm and stagnated drink \u00a9tfc....3 2 The concept of poison is commonly used in the Bencao {Materia Medica ) tradition as a criterion for the classification of living things and natural substances, including foodstuffs. For instance, the famous Shizhen of the Ming dynasty generally specifies whether each foodstuff is poisonous or not $&#. For example, the entry on Rhubarb classifies it as \"bitter and cold, non-poisonous ^Pklfl\"3 3 3 1 BS 2:25. 3 2 BS 2:32 3 3 Bencao gangmu 0 . Compiled by by Terashi Bokuso (Meicho, Tokyo), 179-183. 174 On the other hand, the idea of poison in Bydka suchi raises an interesting prospect. That is, it does not necessarily relate to the poisonous nature of foodstuffs. The harm done by a poison often depends on \"how one eats\" rather than \"what one eats\"; that is, it often depends on the state of one's health, the size of the portions, and the appropriateness of the cooking method used. Even for healthy persons, \"excessive eating\" in particular may lead to dangerously poisonous results, often associated with disturbances of the digestion or the circulation of the blood, as the examples of bonito fish and potatoes demonstrate. In other words, a food can become a poison depending on who eats it or how it is eaten.3 4 How can a foodstuff be both nourishment and poison? A survey of the major yojo texts yields a possible answer to this. At the beginning of the second fascicle, Bydka suchi acknowledges that the object of eating and drinking is \"stopping hunger and thirst, and preserving one's life\".3 5 However throughout most of the fascicle, the author stresses the dangers of intemperate eating. A statement in Yojoben represents kuchi the dangers of eating in this way: \"Mouth P is an abbreviation of \"to rot k u c h i r u This straightforward association between eating and putrefaction needs more explanation. It seems to suggest that food is innately an alien substance that may damage the body at any moment. Such an idea is also found in Hippocratic medicine, which recognises the potential danger of food as well as the nourishment it provides. 3 4 Takizawa explains that \"poison\" in the Edo dietary refers to incompatible combinations of foods according to the categorisation ofy/n and yang, and Five Phases theory, or it can be an expression for something that is acknowledged to be harmful for the body after generations of experience (Takizawa 2001, 72). BS 2:1. 3 6 Yojdben, kohen Jt, 29. 175 It must be considered whether the patient will be strong enough for the diet when the disease is at its height. Will the patient be exhausted first and not be strong enough for the diet, or will the disease be blunted and exhausted first?3 7 This passage conjures up the image of a contest of strength between the patient, the food and the disease. However, Edo-period dietary theory differs from the Hippocratic view in assigning responsibility for the harm done by diet. Often, the nature of the food itself is not regarded as bearing any responsibility. Yojoben contends that \"there is no such thing as poisonous foods, but simply excessive eating that turns [foods] into poison\".3 8 Yojo ydron also warns that people should not fret about the formula for \"avoiding poisonous foods\" because \"the real poison lies in eating [foods with] strong flavours constantly and excessively, even if the foods themselves are not poisonous\".3 9 Why does food becomes poison? In Edo-period yojd thought, it is explained by saying that even good food rots in the stomach if one eats wrongly, and this produces the poison. Yojd ydron maintains that \"cereal, meat and vegetables, [are] all originally meant to nourish the human body, and [are] not poisonous. Yet all of them become poisonous due to excessive eating and rot in the stomach. People do not eat things that are already rotten from the start, but many of us are not cautious about food rotting in the stomach\".4 0 The process of decay in the stomach is illustrated in this way: 3 7 Hippocratic Writings, 207. 3 8 Eisei 3:209. 3 9 Yojoben, shohen jo Ji, 12. 4 0 Eisei 1:126. A similar statement is also found in Ydjdkim , 87. 176 When everyday food is not digested and goes rotten, it becomes acid water St zK. You should know this from the fact that rice and wine taste acidic when they go rotten. Vinegar accelerates decay. Therefore even if food bypasses \"stagnant acid rotten water\" Hl&M , it is gradually dispersed and goes rotten, however much one eats, the stomach cannot be full, and one feels like eating more and more...Day by day, year by year, the decay in the end fills up the stomach (.Yojoben ).4 1 The image of \"acid rotten water\" is probably evoked by the acidity of gastric juices. Overeating does not just cause stagnation within the stomach, but also the food itself rots and turns into poison. In the context of the Edo period, the idea of decay involves parallels between the outside and the inside of the body.4 2 Thus however careful one is to avoid indigestible or rotten food, if one eats to excess, the result will be the same in the long run 4 3 Therefore \"poison\" is not only traceable to the nature of foodstuffs such as globefish or aconite. Potential poison exists in every food, just awaiting transformation into poison by a person's intemperate nature and gluttony. 4 1 Yojoben, shohen chu T5 , 12-13. statement is also found in Yojddan, Eisei 3:60. 4 2 The association of \"decay\" with the process of digestion may show a certain influence from Boerhaave, of the Leiden School. A few medical texts of the Leiden School are known to have been translated by Edo physicians. Frederik Cryns 2006, (Rinsen shoten, Kyoto), 310. 4 3 I have examined the idea of decay in the view of digestion in Edo dietary theory. During the Edo period, the term food damage, which in the Chinese medical tradition is caused by excessive eating, often indicates food poisoning. This conflation probably stems from the idea of decay within the stomach, which equates eating something rotten with making foods go rotten in the stomach. Daidoji 2005,147-167. 2-5. Massage and pressure: tactile remedies and suchi favours massage or pressure as remedies. Ishihara (1931), for instance, classifies the many massage methods scattered throughout Bydka suchi into eleven categories: (1) massage for convulsions during pregnancy or morning sickness, (2) massage to make a new-born baby produce its first cry, (3) whole-body massage to cure chronic diseases, (4) massage after meals, (5) abdominal massage to adjust the position of the foetus, (6) whole-body massage to rouse a person from sleeping sickness, (7) massage for paralysis, (8) massage for fainting due to ki reverse ( kinuke yamai M $\u00a3#!), (9) martial arts massage method for fainting # H , (10) massage for dizziness and (11) massage for increasing breast milk.4 4 Although Ishida's categorisation covers all the methods in the text without omission, I would like to divide the massage methods in Bydka suchi into two groups: massage for acute symptoms and for chronic symptoms. This approach will highlight an interesting aspect of the relation between massage treatment and pathology in Bydka suchi. Pressing and rubbing the seat of the disorder is said to be effective as a first aid for many acute symptoms, while abdominal massage is able to disperse most chronic afflictions. Among the various conditions that are dealt with, the illness known as kan stands out as a key to understanding massage. In Hirano Jusei's view, many of the acute illnesses that are treated with pressure are to be categorised as kan, and for those suffering from chronic kan as the primary diagnosis, he also invented his own method of abdominal massage. The unique pathology of kan seems to underlie his choice of massage and pressure remedies, and these tactile cures are a feature of treatment in Bydka suchi. Thus this section 4 4 Ishihara Yasuhide Taniguchi shoten, Tokyo), 231-234. 178 will examine the symptoms to which pressure and massage are applied, and how the pathology of kan is associated with them. When/to whomChronic Symptomsr 1 Method Before sleepkan, chronic shaku, uterine diseases, twitching in babies, kan (SUM)When you go to sleep, first lie on your back, stretch both legs and calmly stroke downward from the chest and ribs to the lower abdomen with both hands several dozen times. Then stroke from the hinge joint of the waist to the thighs, stretching both hands as far as they will go, several dozen times. Afterwards slowly move the big toes. All the time you are stroking the chest and ribs, do it lightly, then moderately from the pit of the stomach to around the navel, and firmly towards the lower abdomen.

Table 13. Massage for chronic symptoms 2-5-1. Chronic symptoms 179 Firstly, the initial fascicle o f Bydka suchi twice mentions a massage method for use before going to sleep which also cures chronic diseases. It is a combination o f breath-regulation and abdominal massage, recommended as not only able to regulate the whole body, but also effective against such longstanding afflictions as kan, shaku , uterine diseases, paralysis, numb legs, infantile convulsions, colic, and other difficult illnesses. Abdominal massage before sleep is discussed from pages fifteen to seventeen, and further detail is provided by four illustrations (on pages 271, 272 o f this thesis). This method was developed by Hirano, and is especially directed at women and the elderly, who are thought to find traditional therapeutic gymnastic excessively complex and difficult to practise. Lie down on your back, relaxing the area around the shoulders and the neck, lowering both hands alongside the body, stretching out both legs, and let the whole body be free o f any stagnation...First open the mouth and breathe out from under the navel seven times. Then shut your mouth and close your eyes, calm your mind, and stroke downwards from chest and ribs to the lower abdomen thoroughly with both hands while you chant songs thrice seven times. This is the first step. Afterward from the top o f the thighs to the joints o f the hips, both the inner and outer sides towards the knees, stroke firmly downwards in turn as far as the palm can reach while chanting songs seven times. This is the second step. Then stretch both legs and m ove the big toes while chanting songs seven times. This is the third step. As mentioned above, when you have finished everything, in a composed manner chant songs thirty-five times, remaining as you were, with the whole body relaxed and nowhere strained. Then inhale 180 through the nostrils and calmly make the breath reach below the navel thrice seven tim es.4 5 r* Abdominal massage accompanied by chanting is effective for such disorders as wom en's blood-related diseases, sha1cu46> exhaustion, a depressed mind, stagnated drink, paralysis and other chronic illnesses, as w ell as pain in the abdomen or back. Pregnant women who have trouble walking due to the position o f the foetus being on one side w ill also be cured. The choice o f chant is not critical: a Daoist incantation, a Buddhist chant, a Japanese poem, or any song will do. The important thing is to use the rhythm and soothing sound as an aid to relaxation. According to Bydka suchi , kan is especially typical o f women. It causes many troubles: uneasy sleep, nightmares, feelings o f stuffiness in the heart and abdomen, continual dizziness and headache, and so forth. Abdominal massage has the effect o f soothing the mind, thereby dissolving the worries that form stiffness or congelation in the body. Once the mental state becomes peaceful, these troubles spontaneously cease to occur. 4 5 BS 1:15-17. 4 6 Along with kan, shaku was one of the most prevalent everyday afflictions for people in the Edo period, and there is no doubt that abdominal massage was meant to cure shaku , too. Here however, the discussion centres on methods developed for patients with a primary diagnosis of kan.

Massage after a meal (BS 2:36) 182 The variety of symptoms makes it seem as if massage is regarded almost as a panacea in Bydka suchi . This view is in tune with the instructions for massage after meals in the second fascicle (Illustration 5). To promote digestion, one shpuld first massage lightly from the forehead to both cheeks and eyelids, then rub a little more firmly from the chest to the lower abdomen, and lastly massage the arches of the feet vigorously. This method is able to remove \"stagnation of food and drink If which is \"the beginning of various diseases\"47 . In other words it can be assumed that this massage is able to prevent a range of illnesses. Tanaka (1996) argues that the idea of a panacea in Edo-period yojd was first developed by Hakuin, who emphasised the efficacy of the breath-regulation method as a cure-all which efficaciously incorporates Zen thought. Hakuin's method became the prototype of many kinds of breath-regulation for later yojo writers, including Hirano Jusei,4 8 Regarding the method of breath-regulation, the master-disciple lineage between Hakuin and Hirano is established in Yojoketsu, which states that Hirano learned the method from a disciple of Hakuin himself.4 9 It is thus to be assumed that Hirano attached the utmost importance to breath-regulation in yojo practice. However, Byoka suchi actually employs massage much more frequently as a treatment than breath-regulation, whereas this typically appears in the first fascicle of yojo texts to be taught only once as a means of harmonising the body. The preference for massage in Bydka suchi can probably be attributed to its simplicity as well as concern about congelation in the body. Firstly, massage is easier and simpler for \"women and elderly people\", compared to breath-regulation, 4 7 BS 2:38. 4 8 Tanaka Satoshi 1996, Kenkoho to iyashi no shakaishi (Seikyusha, Tokyo), 50-54. 4 9 Eisei 3:164-171. 183 which often involves meditation. Secondly, massage addresses the fear of congealed ki as a tangible clump or stiffness in the body, which constitutes the seat of afflictions. Abdominal massage is intended to disperse this, thereby promoting good ki circulation. These factors may explain the use of massage in Bydka suchi as a virtual panacea; however, I would like to revisit the relation between massage treatment and symptoms, especially kan, from the opposite direction. That is, why did abdominal massage become a cure-all for kan in the first place? In other words, why does kan cover so many symptoms as to include almost all illnesses? It is possible that an account of kan and its pathology will be able to elucidate the mechanism of the massage cure, and Hirano's strong belief in it. 2-5-2. Kan Firstly for instance, the Chinese pathological text Yuanhoulun , considers jian (Chinese pronunciation of kan to be a children's illness. Dian refers to an illness of children over ten years old, while jian affects those under ten years old. Its symptoms present as twitching mouth and eyes, dazzled eyes, or cramps in the arms and legs, a rigid back, or a twisted neck.5 0 In Edo-period Japan, however, the scope of reference of kan underwent considerable transformation. In the late seventeenth century Byomei ikai explains that when kan occurs, one abruptly loses consciousness and faints, the body becomes numb, and one clenches one's teeth and foams at the mouth.5 1 This 5 0 Yuanhoulun, ' jianhou 1289-1290. 5 1 Tenkan {dianxian in Chinese) is usually understood as spasm or seizure, although interpretations vary. According to Byomei ikai , in Edo medicine the character 0 is sometimes used alone as a synonym of However and $8 are not originally the same. For instance, some authors claim that a patient with Hi suddenly loses consciousness, whereas one 184 version seems to follow the Chinese definition closely. But by the late eighteenth century, Ippondo koyoigen observes that fright M, seizure 9$, and madness < \u00a3 \u00a3 are collectively known in Japan as kan, which is widespread as a familiar term among the general public, and even people who are pompous or obsessed with C')cleanliness are also regarded as afflicted with kan. Nowadays in contemporary Japanese, kansho {kan nature/symptom) is an expression used to describe the personality of someone who is particularly anxious and fanatical about cleanliness. This suggests that kan has in the long run established itself in its secondary meaning, gradually casting off its medical tenor. What brought about these changes? According to Hoi kuketsu P (Oral secrets of technical terminology, 1865) by Asai Teian (1770-1829), the meaning of kan in Japan passed through three stages: initially it referred to twitching and convulsions, then later to epilepsy, and in his own time to difficult character traits. By Asai's time all kinds of twitching or wrenching in a muscle can be called kan, although that is clearly different from its original meaning in Chinese tradition. Tracing the background of this change, Hoi kuketsu argues that twitching or depression are merely secondary symptoms of the primary kan, but conversely, people have come to regard all twitching, convulsion, and worries as kan. Moreover, in general parlance, kan is widely used in reference to people who have particularly complicated habits of thinking or acting, or become nervous about every detail. In the extreme extension of the term, even personal characteristics like being pompous or cowardly, or even ill educated, come to be called kan, too. with madly runs about. Others regard 0 as a disease of adults, and M as one of children ( .Byomei 383-385. 185 The complexity of kan lies in the term itself. Hoi kuketsu points out that sometimes vulgar doctors write kansho as ITSe (kansho: liver symptom), although it is \"nothing but a mistake\".5 3 Including liver kan, there are three terms read kan in kan kan K a n the Edo-period medical context: 0 (spasm), (infant colic), and IT (liver symptom). As already pointed out in Hoi kuketsu , epileptic kan $0 came to refer to all kinds of twitching and convulsions. In the case of liver kan IT, the liver corresponds to anger in Five Phases theory, so kan came to mean \"bad temper\". As a result, kan in the Edo period came to indicate not only the variety of symptoms caused by the original kan illness, but often personal characteristics as well. In addition, as long as kan was seen as part of a person's nature, many of the kan symptoms were regarded as chronic. 2-5-3. Acute symptoms Let us now examine the acute symptoms to which massage or pressure is applied as first aid, because most of them are categorised as kan in Bydka suchi. Bydka suchi puts forward a rather unique pathology of kan, which is based on the interpretation of the character kan The character - f t \u00ae consists of (a radical for disease) + P C I (partition/distance), thereby illustrating that kan causes the spirit to be \"set apart\" from the body. Bydka suchi maintains that this is why the diseases with the character are all related to the mental faculties. Unconsciousness, dizziness, convulsions, sleeping sickness, insomnia, nightmares, feeling unwell on awakening, madness in women, women's blood-related diseases, depression, anger, regret, frustration, worry, uneasiness, fright, flushing, headache, 5 3 Hoi kuketsu, KKIS edition, vol. 78, 'kanshomon 327-330. 186 tinnitus, and paralysis are all different manifestations of kan.5 4 Furigana-character compounds also display the variations of kan in Bydka suchi.

Kan: separation of the soul from the body Kansho or kichigai for / I \u00ae (organ agitation) refers to madness based on the idea that the inner organs of a lunatic wriggle and become agitated. Kan (infant colic) is often used in reference to children who have a swollen belly due to undernourishment and cry habitually at night. In the account given in Byomei ikai, kyofu H P (fright wind) causes convulsive fits and twitching in the eyes and mouth, while kydkan Hi\u00ae (fright kan) is a complication of kyofu and kan.5 5 An examination of the furigana shows that Bydka suchi interconnects kan, madness and infant colic. Figure > kansho \u2014 \u00bb kan \u2014 kansho HcIS kichigai M M The sixth fascicle of Byoka suchi gives an account of acute symptoms ranging from poisoning to various kinds of attack, wounds and injuries, and recommends treatment methods for them. Pressure and massage are recommended for such 5 4 BS 6:21. 5 5 Byomei ikai, 133. 187 symptoms as convulsions, constipation, sudden infant death, dizziness, sleeping sickness, apoplexy, paralysis, stupor, and unconsciousness (Table 15). When/to whom Acute Symptoms Method ' Babyinfantile convulsions (after vomiting milk)Press firmly on the pit of the stomach and fuyd (below the left breast), and push down towards the navel. Use the fingers or the outstretched palm. When pressing the side bone of your palm against the pit of the child's stomach, it is also good to press down in a scooping manner. If you feel the heart throbbing beneath your fingers, press harder and do not let up (BS 3: 19) (Illustration 6). Newborn babywhen a newborn baby does not give a first cryMassage the shoulders with the finger tips until the baby cries (BS 4: 23) (Illustration 7). when a baby is crushed to death under the mother's breastIf it is shortly after death, massage the shoulders, strike the back and splash water. Pregnant women^ 'reversal during pregnancy.

This method is also effective for children's convulsions and heart failure from beriberi (4:12). After delivery urine retentionThere is a projection in the left side of the lower abdomen, where the waist bone and the pubic bone intersect. Press there; it causes pain which extends to the urethra. Push there, and pull that part up; then she will pass urine (BS 4: 12-16) (Illustration 10). After deliverysudden dizziness from anaemiaThere is a clump thrusting up from the pit of the stomach to below the left rib. Press the clump downward with the fist (BS 4:25-28) (Illustration 11), 188 After deliveryrigidity after delivery (but without loss of consciousness)The right hand presses the border of the abdomen and ribs below the left breast, while the left hand presses from the neck to the shoulders (BS 4: 28-30) (Illustration 12) After delivery sudden bleedingPress down firmly on the buttocks with both hands to close the passage of bleeding (BS 4: 30-33).

Roughly speaking, many of these symptoms involve convulsive attacks and unconsciousness, and they are all categorised as kan in Bydka suchi. Here is a description of the treatment for a case of sleeping sickness, which is representative of treatment for other acute kan illnesses as well. When one feels the shoulders of the patient, one can feel deep-rooted congelation. Take hold of this to break it up. The pain will then pass through the patient's head until the patient utters a sound. Without releasing your hold, push back the congelation into the shoulders with force again and again. Then rub the ribs firmly from the shoulders down to the pit of the stomach. Placing both hands around the navel, seize the ribs, and pull them up forcefully. After this, strike the middle of the back hard with your fist. If one finds a congealed knot in the region of the shoulders, backbone, and armpit, it should be rubbed firmly. When one feels any knot within the body, just massage from the head to the shoulders, abdomen, arms and legs (Illustration 14).5 6 5 6 BS 6:9-11. 194 Illustration 14: Pushing and striking to treat sleeping sickness (BS 6: 10) In addition to sleeping sickness, apoplexy, paralysis, stupor, long-lived pain, sudden unconsciousness, and dizziness are also identifiable by stiffness or clumps in the upper part of the body. The precise nature of the condition called chomeitsu 3# (long-lived pain) is unknown; but first aid for all these symptoms aims at breaking up or pushing down clumps by means of pressure, in order to restore the 195 patient to consciousness as soon as possible. On the other hand, in patients suffering from urine retention and sudden dizziness from anaemia after childbirth, one needs to find a projection or something thrusting up in the abdominal area. For convulsions in pregnant women and babies, one needs to press firmly on the pit of the stomach or below the left breast. Why do tactile stimuli show efficacy for these kan? The answer can be found in the pathology of kan. Bydka suchi simply explains that kan is due to the separation of mind from body. However as we have already explained, the significance of kan in the Edo-period vocabulary became quite complicated. Bydka suchi seems by no means free from the general view of kan in the Edo period, to judge from the many permutations of Chinese characters with which the furigana is juxtaposed. Firstly, for instance, Yojoben considers kan as an illness of the vessels whereby the vessels become shrunken and taut, resulting in pressure on the five viscera. When the internal organs become strained, one is apt to be hot-tempered, or to worry without a reason. Furthermore kan makes people unsociable, lacking in endurance, inconsistent in mind, suspicious, and cruel. Most important of all, kan causes the accumulation of ki in the pit of the stomach, which forms a blockage.5 7 Similarly Ippondo koyoigen attributes the origin of kan to a congealed clump ^ in the abdomen which puts pressure on the heart. When heart ki is subject to pressure, it causes depression and blockage, which creates the various symptoms of kan.5* These medical texts say that kan forms ki accumulation, and puts pressure on the inner organs. Secondly, kan causes a \"thrusting upward\" in the flow of ki flow For instance, in Enjutai koyo ryakuki II1S (Synopsis of efficacious 8 Ippondo koyoigen , rojin [a pen name of Hirano Jusei], year of first publication unknown), Hirano considers this change in ki to be a contemporary illness. Peaceful times have lasted long. People lapse into luxury and idleness, and indulge in both alcohol and sexual pleasure, and excessive thinking . Thus there are only a few who are free of illness. In all illnesses, eight or nine times out of ten, something thrusts up and migrates towards the upper body. For example, colds, headaches, stiff shoulders, stiffness in the back, coughing, blockage and accumulation of ki in the chest, vomiting from stagnant drink, numbness from beriberi, all result in cramp and thrusting up 3 1. In addition, vomiting milk, twitching, fright wind MM, and infant colic (kan $f) in babies, and madness and irregular menstruation in women are all caused by thrusting up and incorrect circulation in the lower abdomen... Congealed clumps, stiffness and twitching should be soothed (stress added).5 9 The passage above asserts that there is a \"modem\" tendency for people to suffer from \"thrust up\" illnesses due to disordered living. We also notice that many of those \"modem\" illnesses include kan symptoms as categorised in Bydka Bydka suchi , the idea of \"thrusting up\" is hinted at in the pathology of paralysis, one of the manifestations of kan. The initial cause of paralysis is attributed to the thrusting-up of inner organs. This results in the obstruction of ki movement, and the area below the heart becomes constricted due to \"retrograde 5 9 Eisei 2:354-358. 197 upward movement of ki ^@ i'\\ Therefore one feels \"heavy in the upper body, while light in the lower (kami omoku shimo karoku This suggests that massage and pressure are intended to push back the upward movement of ki or clumps of ki to assist the natural circulation of bodily ki, which should primarily flow from the top down. Paralysis in Bydka suchi resonates with the explanation of dian SB in the Chinese text Sttwen, where it is seen as a disorder involving the reversal of qi due to fright: \"qi only goes upward, but cannot come downward ^ V - h ^ T ) \".6 1 As pointed out in Ippondo seizure 8\u00ae , and often conflated in the Edo period. Byoka suchi sums them all up as kan $0. It can therefore be suggested that Bydka suchi identifies the common factor in these mental disorders as a dysfunction entailing ki reversal, which requires to be pushed down with the hands. This stands in contrast, for instance, with Ydjdkun, which warns against carrying out massage or therapeutic gymnastics in diseases of rising ki.6 2 Bydka suchi differs from Ydjdkun in recognising the movement of ki as a physical flow that can get stuck and form tangible obstructions in the pit of the stomach. In this way, the pathology of kan reveals why kan involves so many symptoms, all due to the retrograde upward movement of ki, which causes corporeal blockages or stiffness in the body. The bias towards massage remedies reflects the view that rubbing or pressing is required to push back down and disperse clumped ki. To summarise, most of the massage and pressure remedies in Bydka suchi relate to kan. In the Edo-period medical milieu, physicians considered that kan occurred 6 0 BS 6:12-13. 6 1 It is originally described as 'a fatal disorder' (taibing Dp#!), which occurs in the womb when the mother has a great fright. Suwen, 'qibinglun oHPlfm', 263. 6 2 Ydjdkun, 105. 198 because of the accumulation of ki in the pit of the stomach, which resulted in ki flowing upwards. Since the ki was flowing against the natural direction of its current, the internal organs were thrust up and became constricted and unbalanced. Because of this, massage in Bydka suchi seems to aim at dispersing congealed clumps or stiffness in the body, thereby opening up blockages which get in the way of ki flow to the head. Similarly the application of pressure to the kan patient is probably an attempt to push the up-thrust ki back down to its rightful place. 2-6. Water Cures The popularity of the water cure in Japan rose and fell. Fujikawa Yu (1865-1940), a pioneering medical historian and himself a practitioner of Western medicine, discusses the application of water in Japanese medicine through history. The application of the water cure for cold damage already appears in Shanghanlun. Thereafter it disappears from the records, and for a long period, many physicians were not keen on this method. However as late as the end of the Edo period, several physicians such as Nakagami Kinkei Kouta Tsunetomo Tachibana Shoken and Hirano Genryo jc began to make claims for the effectiveness of the water cure and recommended [applying] it to fever from cold damage.6 4 6 3 For instance, Shanghanlun says \"when the illness is yang, it should be dissolved by perspiration. But, conversely, if one applies cold water by splashing, the fever cannot be removed: Shanghanlun Hr^fro. By Zhang Zhongjing $5#)!; (3r (Renmin weisheng chubanshe, Beijing), 'wengesan 3C&nffc\\ 302. Although this is an example of an unsuccessful remedy, it points to the existence of water cures. 6 4 Fujikawa Yu, Nihon shippeishi (reprinted in 1969, Tokyo, Heibonsha) 285-286. 199 The statement shows that the water cure had gained popularity in the late Edo period after a period of eclipse. Nakagami Kinkei (1744-1833) a physician of the Classic School, mentions water cures in Seiseidd itan (Tales of medicine by Seiseidd is the author 1811), while Tachibana Shoken (d. 1849) wrote Bakufu konoki (Record of the efficacy of the waterfall, 1812), and Hirano Genryo is, as already stated, a pen name of Hirano Jusei. As a therapeutic method, the water cure has always been found at the fringes of medical practice. However the fact remains that these medical texts speak of water in diverse forms and contexts. The physicians mentioned above contend that not only cold damage but various other illnesses too can be cured by water. For instance, Kansuihen '$i 7 .K states that splashing with water is effective for \"the five accumulations six gatherings congealed clumps {lift\u00ae and colic pain since they all descend along with water. Water also flushes out illnesses such as beri-beri, paralysis, and consumption\".6 5 Seiseidd itan ^[SEP? gives examples of water treatment for such conditions as madness, fever, epilepsy, melancholy, bruising, unconsciousness, sudden fright AJB, dizziness, headache, chill and smallpox.6 6 Regarding Hirano Jusei and the water cure, Bydka suchi contains scattered references to the healing powers of water for many symptoms, when splashed, spat, imbibed, bathed in, and so on. Despite, however, containing a substantial number of examples, Bydka suchi always omits any detailed explanation of why and how water 6 5 Kansuihen , by Kouta Tsunetomo (1811). Facsimile edition, in 5. 6 6 Seiseido itan , 17, 76-84. 200 achieves efficacy, saying only: \"The details are not to be mentioned here, see Kisai bigen and Suiryo zokuben z \"see Kansuiko for further explanation\" . However the whereabouts and the contents of the texts he cites are lost to us today, and only their names appear in Byoka suchi. Presumably Hirano wished to avoid too much overlapping of contents between texts, and unnecessary discussion of complex theory in a popular home medicine text like Byoka suchi. This section will thus collect together and examines the fragmentary and limited references to water cures that are interspersed throughout the text of Byoka suchi , with the aim of reconstructing the physiology and pathology that lies behind them. 2-6-1. Methods and effects The therapeutic methods of applying water mentioned in Byoka suchi can be divided into five categories: application by (1) listening, (2) washing, (3) bathing in when hot, (4) spitting, (5) imbibing, and (6) pumping (Figure 33).

The illustration shows that one sets up two containers of water at different heights near the patient's head, in such a way that the water drips continuously from the upper container into the lower one. (Illustration 15) Effect. The sound of water is used as a hypnotic method. The idea is to let the patient count the dripping sounds of water, which works as a sedative when one is unable to fall asleep owing to uneasiness or worries, exhaustion or nightmares. Illustration 15: Water dripping device (BS 1:48-49) Unlike other modes of water application, this method does not involve any direct physical stimulus. Why the sound achieves efficacy is not clarified in the text, 203 but it seems to be related to mechanisms of dreaming. In the opening of the passage on the water dripping method, Byoka suchi refers to the importance of the ancient instruction \"to stop thinking, calm the mind and store the soul\" to obtain sound sleep without nightmares. What does \"store the soul\" mean? Although the original source of this statement is unknown, it seems to fit the aetiology of dreaming in Lingshu. When right evil IH 3 T IS 6 9 attacks the body from outside and cannot find the proper place to settle, it flows into the viscera fi^ and drifts around. The evil circulates with the structural 's' and protective qi within the body, and acts tactless/rashly towards the hun and po soul sS 6f$L They trouble sound sleep, and \u00bbJAcause dreams. Byoka suchi mentions neither qi (ki) nor evil, but both Byoka suchi and Lingshu agree on the point that when the soul drifts away from its rightful place, it causes uneasy sleep and dreams. Therefore the dripping method may perhaps function by concentrating the mind on counting the sounds of water, thereby preventing the soul from moving aimlessly about. An advantage of this method is that it can be used as an alternative to hypnotic drugs. Hirano strongly objects to the use of sleeping pills based on \"an amateur's complacent judgement, as [the case] is difficult [to assess] even for a medical niprofessional\". It is not clear what exactly Byoka suchi intends by the term rendered as \"sleeping pill\", as the reading nemuri gusuri does indeed refer simply to a sleeping pill, but the Chinese characters used here strongly suggests an anaesthetic. Little is 6 9 Right evil indicates seasonal wind as a pathogen; it blows from the correct direction with respect to the season, Ishida 1987,288. 7 0 Lingshu, 'yinxiefameng 17-18. 7 1 BS 1:48-49. 204 known about the use of hypnotic drugs during the Edo period, and the suspicion occurs that \"sleeping pill\" in Byoka suchi may imply something more like an anaesthetic. This supposition may not be unfounded, because the news that a physician Hanaoka Seishu (1760-1835) had for the first time succeeded in carrying out a surgical operation under anaesthetic (made mainly from mandarage [datura] and aconite) caused quite a sensation in Edo-period medical circles.7 2 It is possible then that anaesthetics or something similar had begun to circulate in the drug market, and that lay people sometimes took them as soporifics without proper knowledge of their effects and possible risks. Byoka suchi recommends the sound of water because, whether or not it is effective, it is at least \"harmless\". (2) Washing with water Method. One should wash cuts, tired eyes and venereal ulcers with cold water (douches). Pure water is harmless, but a layperson may fear that washing the injured part with pure water could cause tetanus. Although this fear is unfounded, one can mix ash with water in order to ease the minds of those who feel concerned. For cuts, wounds and uterine bleeding, one can use a water pistol (children's toy) or a kettle to spray or pour on the water. Effect, Washing with cold water seems basically to be an empirical and naturalistic treatment. Washing cleanses dirt and blood from the wound, and tired eyes can also be refreshed by cold water. In the case of boils on the genitalia, douching is used to keep the genital area clean and dry, as the area is liable to be \"foul due to being covered by dirty 7 2 Hanaoka Seishu carried out an operation to remove a cancerous breast tumour under anaesthetic in 1804. 205 underwear\", which should be most particularly avoided . Also, the jet of water from a water pistol makes the genitals constrict and closes the passage of bleeding between the uterus and vulva. Meanwhile the wound in the uterus will heal gradually.7 4 The disease poisons from boils on the genitalia can gradually retrocede and eventually result in genital dysfunction, so it is extremely important to purge the poisons as soon as possible in the form of pus, by washing with a lotion and taking internal medicine. However one can achieve great efficacy just by washing with cold water, because '' the use of washing lotion cannot be explained to laypersons so easily\".7 5 Again, blind reliance on self-prescribed medicines by lay people should be avoided, and water is suggested as a harmless option. (3) Hot baths Method. There are only two prescriptions for hot baths, for diarrhoea and cold 7/ilegs due to nosebleed. When one feels chilled in the initial stages of diarrhoea, bathing (especially the lower body) in very hot water with a pinch of salt is 7 3 BS 5:3. 7 4 BS 4:31. 7 5 BS 5:3. 7 6 Although Byoka suchi mentions hot baths only a few times, bathing and balneology are a popular topic in the Edo medical texts. For instance, Ydjokun discusses how to bathe and the effectiveness of hot baths for conditions such as diarrhoea, food damage and stomach ache {Ydjokun, 113). As far as hot springs are concerned, the famous Goto Konzan was given the nickname Yunokumakyuan (\"Dr Bath-Bear-and-Moxa\"), for his three favourite treatments: dietetics (especially the use of bear heart as a panacea), balneology, and moxibustion. Kagawa Shuan, author of recommends Kinosaki (in present-day Hyogo prefecture) as the best hot spring, which is particularly famous for curing swellings. Many scholarly works have examined the cultural/social/economic/anthropological aspects of bathing and balneology in Japan. For instance, the general history of bathing culture in Japan is referenced in such works as Matsudaira Makoto 1997, Nyuyoku no kaitai shinsho (shogakukan, Tokyo), Nakano edition from Yuzankaku, Tokyo). An anthropological approach to bathing culture is found in Yoshida Shuji 1995, Furo to ecstasy (Heibonsha, Tokyo). Suzuki relates the popularity of hot springs and daily bathing in the Edo period to changes in concepts of the body. See Suzuki Noriko 1999 'Hot Springs in the Edo Period', Yoshida and F ukase, 197-215. 206 recommended. The hotter the water, the better. Afterwards one should dry the body well, put on warm clothing and take hot food with plenty of soup. If one finds the legs to be chilled owing to a nosebleed, it is good to soak both legs in hot water, to which a few pinches of powdered alum may be added. Effect. In the case of diarrhoea, it is extremely important to begin perspiring as soon as possible in order to get rid of the disease poisons completely. According to Byoka suchi , diarrhoea is a disease of yangming (where yang ki is most 7 7vigorous) . Regarding the correlation of Jusei's Uta shokan zatubydron zokuben offers a more explicit account. Yangming disease is located in the abdomen. The evil ki reaches yangming , therefore the treatment needs to lead [evil ki] to the surface, and disperse it through sweating. This [method] is meant to destroy the power of [evil ki] to penetrate inside, and to suppress uneasiness in the abdomen.7 8 A hot bath, therefore, stimulates perspiration from two angles. For one thing, it warms up the body from inside, and for another, hot water is considered to open up the pores of the skin.7 9 On the other hand, it is difficult to understand the reasoning behind the recommendation of hot baths for nosebleeds, as no pathology or expected effect is mentioned. Probably, the hot bath is simply intended to warm up the chilled legs. 7 7 Yangming is the name of a vessel. It refers to the yangming stomach vessel of the legs W & B ff $ 3 * and the yangming colon vessel of the hands 7 8 Uta shokan zatubydron zokuben , University, fascicle 4,3-4. 7 There was a general consensus among Edo-period physicians that taking long baths is dangerous because it opens the skin pores wide and leaves the body vulnerable to outer evil (see, for instance, Ydjokun , 113). 207 (4) Spitting water Method. One should try spitting cold water over the face of a newborn infant r who fails to cry, and the same method is recommended in case of infantile convulsions, and post-partum bleeding or dizziness.. Effect. For a weak newborn infant, the shock occasioned by spitting cold water may be sufficient to cause him or her to give a first cry. In other cases water has a cooling effect. Both convulsions and dizziness occur due to \"the retrograde upward movement of ki which should be treated by cooling. Uterine bleeding often involves such symptoms as \"fever, perspiration and palpitations\" which are categorised as \"hot\" in nature; thus cooling will bring relief.8 0 (5) Imbibing water Method. Drinking cold water is effective for severe vomiting and diarrhoea \u00a7 } \u00a7 L 81, food poisoning, and pain caused by threadworms or pinworms.8 2 Sometimes, drinking can be combined with spitting water over the patient's face, which is particularly effective for those who have palpitations, which cause heating in the heart. Effect. Firstly the coldness of the water can relieve the pain of threadworms, because it produces a shock in the worms in the intestines, which then release their bite (of the inner body).8 3 Secondly drinking water cools down the inner organs. Byoka suchi contends 8 0 BS 4:30-33. 8 1 BS 6:3-4. 8 2 BS 6:4. 8 3 BS 6:29. 208 that one should let the patient drink as much cold water as he or she wants because it shows '\"the need of [one's] own vital essence which tries to moisten and cure the heated inner abdomen\", and anyway water is \"harmless\".8 4 Furthermore the cooling effect of water is related to detoxification. As pointed out in Byoka suchi , \"all toxins quicken with heat, and cease with coldness\"8 5 . There was a general consensus in Edo-period medicine on the association of toxins with heat, which allows for detoxification by water. For instance, the Edo-period physician Tachibana Nankei (1753-1805) states: \"All toxins are extremely hot in nature, and therefore whatever the toxin may be, drinking cold water can work as an antidote\". In this way, the use of water for food poisoning is designed to be a cooling antidote. (6) Affusion Method. I will classify as \"affusion\" the sixth and last model, whereby the patient is soaked with water. Examples of this are water being pumped over someone, or someone being placed under a waterfall, or bathed in a well, or immersed and made to swim in a river. For instance, two illustrations show a woman who has gone mad being splashed with cold water while restrained by three men, and a man who has gone mad(?) due to yin reversal disease swimming in a river (Illustrations 16 and 17).8 7 Pumping cold water over the patient is the main method, among the water cures described in Byoka suchi. It is applied to various symptoms: kan 0 2 ^ , seizures, 8 4 BS 5:29. 8 5 BS 6:6. 8 6 apoplexy, convulsion, fright kan jRflffl, unconsciousness fainting from ^ ' -reversal M i , madness, dog bite (rabies), rush of blood to the head, fevers, chronic chills, periodic fever, initial stages of consumption, smallpox, leprosy, small boils, numb limbs, nosebleed, food poisoning and others. It is used as well to strengthen a weak infant. In particular, pumping water is effective for fever and madness of many kinds, such as fever from the initial stages of smallpox, fevers or madness from cold damage, and madness from yin reversal disease Effect. Firstly, the coldness of the water and the stimulation from pumping have an energising effect on the body. The intended effect is probably to stimulate numb limbs or strengthen a weak infant. Secondly it may be possible to consider the efficacy of water from the viewpoint of yin and yang differentiation. Water is innately yin, and in most instances of pumping, water is applied to yang symptoms, thereby combating the disease. 210 3 4 * #'*^i5-v<'\u2014 WG\u00a5*Y^97~v*fe^4>-*V4$>'36' j ( 4*$\u2014 *)\u00ab\u00bb*'S f t j * < V j \u00ab * \u00bb \\ \u00ae *i i \u00bb - ' v . * ] 4 c ~-Ifs j J .

Generally speaking, yin symptoms are associated with the inside, of the body, depletion, coldness, the downward movement of ki, chronic illness/languor, inhibition, decline in bodily metabolism or body function, metabolic decline and so forth. On the other hand, yang symptoms are identified with the outside, repletion, heat, the upward movement of ki, acceleration in bodily metabolism and function, acute illness, exuberance, and exhalation. As far as Byoka suchi is concerned, fever, mental disorders, and all kinds of pus and ulcers can be categorised as yang. Yang symptoms (1). \"Heat\" is perhaps the most obvious case of a yang symptom. Periodic fever, fever at the initial stages of consumption or smallpox, and fever from cold damage all obviously involve heat. Furthermore rushes of blood, pus from smallpox and leprosy, and small boils are also attributed to \"heat\", because in Byoka suchi they are regarded as manifestations of \"pent-up toxins\"8 8 in the body. The association between toxins and heat, and the efficacy of cold water as an antidote, have already been mentioned in the section on drinking water. Water cools down \"heat\" of various kinds. Yang symptoms (2). Mental disorders seem to belong to the yang category in Byoka suchi. As we have seen previously, Byoka suchi defines kan very broadly, including various kinds of disorders affecting the mind, such as epilepsy, paralysis, apoplexy, convulsions, infant colic, unconsciousness, fainting from ^'-reversal, madness and dog bite (rabies). To the extent that kan is attributed to the \"upward movement of k f\\ it is a , yang symptom. In the same way, rushes of blood to the head and nosebleeds are also considered yang symptoms, as they occur due to the 8 8 BS 5:5,24. 213 retrograde upward movement of blood. Within this scheme, the application of cold water, being yin, is expected to rectify yang symptoms. Pointing out the role of water as yin to cure yang symptoms, Otomo (1980) contends that the water cure is a type of \"regular treatment Hi?r\" that * KQtreats illnesses by applying something opposite m nature. On the other hand, we also find in Byoka suchi the use of pumped water for yin symptoms, such as extreme yin disease and chills of long duration. It may seem contradictory, but it is based on the principle of yin and yang, whereby each may be transformed into the other, moving from one pole to the other. As mentioned before \"it is often the case that one can obtain efficacy by further wanning up a fever, and further cooling down coldness\"9 0 . When yin reaches its extreme, yin is transformed into yang, as yang is transformed into yin. Water is primarily yin in nature, but it can be used for both yin and yang symptoms in Byoka suchi. Although it is extremely difficult to distinguish which symptoms are yin and which are yang , water achieves a balance between the two attributes, thereby curing the illness. 2-6-2. References How did Hirano Jusei get the idea of using water for various afflictions? In Byoka suchi he contends that the use of pumped water for leprosy is his own original invention which \"the ancients have never mentioned\"91. However, a number of references in Byoka suchi to classic literature suggest that the author collected and widely surveyed examples of water cures described by his predecessors. The records 8 9 Otomo Kazuo 1980 'Suichi\\ available at: http://www.geocities.jp/kokido/. 9 0 BS 2:37, 9 1 BS 5:12. 214 show that bathing or soaking the body in cold water was believed to cure afflictions of the brain, eyes and liver, as well as swelling and so on. For instance, the Emperor Gensho t\u00a3IE (reigned 715-724) visited the waterfall in Mino to cure various symptoms of skin disease92, and the Emperor Sanjo (reign 1011-l6l6) was splashed with water to treat an eye disease.9 3 An essay Tsurezuregusa (published in English as Essays in Idleness , by Kenko hoshi 1310) notes that water is good for abscesses $ K L 9 4 Byoka suchi also mentions the popularity of water cures in the West, \"in the Netherlands, water cures have become highly regarded lately, and they devote themselves exclusively to [this treatment]. [Water cures] are referred to in their medical texts\".9 5 However, this view of the water cure as a peculiarly Dutch practice is probably a misunderstanding on Hirano's part. Although there may have been Dutch texts on the subject, it is more probable that Hirano had come across Dutch translations of texts that were in circulation across contemporary Europe. In the West, the medical uses of water can be traced back to Hippocrates (460-370 BC), but it was not until the eighteenth century that the extensive use of water was promoted as a medical fashion. For instance On the Power and Effect o f Cold Water (1738) by Johann Sigmund Hahn of Silesia went through several editions. At all events, which text Hirano is referring to, we do not know. 9 2 Shoku Nihongi M 0 ^ $ 5 (The sequel to the chronicle of Japan), compiled in 797 CE.

It is thought to have been compiled in the 11th centuiy CE. Reprinted 1963, 9 5 BS 5:31. 215 2-6-3. Analysis What ideas He behind the water cures of Byoka suchi1 ? A survey of the methods and effects of water cures and of the references to classic texts in Hirano's work will r 5 provide some interesting perspectives on the theoretical underpinnings of the uses of water with respect to natural healing power and purification. The relation of water cures to Hirano's objection to the blind usage of medicines will also be examined. (1) Constriction of skin pores One merit of water, as emphasised in Byoka suchi , is that when it is pumped cold onto the skin, it tightens the skin's pores and strengthens the constitution. The pumping of water shows prompter efficacy for those who are lean and pale than for those who are overweight and have a ruddy complexion. Therefore it is problematic to practise the pumping of water on those whose skin pores are not fine... Some say that they feel exhausted after being pumped with water. This is nothing but an amateur's misunderstanding. [Laypersons] do not acknowledge that it is reasonable to use water for those who have become weak, because water tightens the pores of the skin.9 6 The passage above argues that the stimulus of cold water has an energising effect on the skin and ki circulation, thereby strengthening the body. Concern with the opening and closing of the skin pores is also found in the pathology of traditional medicine, in conjunction with the idea of wind as an alien invader. Byoka suchi designates harmful ki by such names as jadoku TftS (evil 9 6 BS 6:24. 216 poison), gaija (outer evil), dokuki (poisonous ki) or kanki (cold ki, in case of cold damage). Harmful ki first attacks the pores of the skin, and then intrudes into the human body and sweeps through it.9 7 For instance, the Chinese text Suwen describes how h a r m f u l ki enters the body through the skin's pores. * This is how the myriad diseases begin. It is always the skin and hair that evil attacks first. It opens the pores of the skin. When the pores of the skin are open, the evil enters the channels and vessels. The evil stays there and does not leave, and moves into the entrails, and putrefies the intestines and stomach. When evil first enters via the skin, the body hair stands up and the pores of the skin open.9 8 If the pores of the skin are loose and open, it means the body is open to invasion. Thus it is naturally assumed that opening and tightening the pores is the key to not allowing the evil pathogen into the body. The coldness of water constricts the pores, thereby blocking evil disease from entering the body,9 9 But where does the association between \"constriction of skin pores\" and \"strengthening the body's constitution\" originate? Of course, traditional medicine links the constriction of the pores with the idea of preventing illnesses, which indirectly leads to health and the strengthening of the body. However, the assertion that cold water has the direct effect of strengthening the body is a feature of Byoka 9 7 BS 5:21. Aikm. ffffiPFA . 1 A M . 'pibulun 5 6 \\ 290. 9 On the other hand, there are also \"warm-factor\" theorists in traditional medicine. Among them, the author of Wenyilun (Treatise of warm-factor epidemics), Wu Youxing (c.1644) is particularly famous and influential. Instead of attributing epidemics to traditional \"seasonal qF or to \"cold damage\" which invades the body through the skin pores, Wu Youxing proposed the concept of liqi According to his theory, there are many different kinds of liqi that enter the body through the nose and mouth. Every liqi attacks a different viscus, thereby causing all the different symptoms. 217 suchi. Though it remains a mere speculation, it may be possible to see here the influence of water cures in the contemporary West. In the nineteenth to early twentieth-century West, the popularity of water cures was promoted by a belief in natural healing. Criticising reliance on drugs as'artificial and unhygienic, health reformers tried to take control of the destiny of human health through such things as wholesome diet, regulation of life style and the therapeutic use of waters. The most influential of these reformers was a Silesian, Vincenz Priessnitz (1799-1851) whose hydropathy became to a popular sensation. In the naturopathy movement, this trend was further developed by such people as Sylvester Graham (1794-1851), the French physician Francois Broussais (1772-1838) and Father Sebastian Kneipp (1821-97) in Bavaria. In America too, Thomsonism, a movement initiated by Samuel Thomson (1769-1843) advocated the effectiveness of water as a form of homely medicine.1 0 0 In addition, a number of medical spas were developed in sixteenth to early twentieth-century Europe, where patients sought such forms of treatment as douches, wet-sheet wrapping, bathing, and drinking the waters for various disorders.1 0 1 As for the therapeutic virtues of water, water cures were primarily concerned with re-establishing the body's own natural healing power. Based on the concept that insalubrious air, mental disorder, intemperate diet, and the suppression of perspiration not only cause deterioration in the bodily function, but also produce noxious fluids in the body, water cures were often seem as sudorific or purgative. 1 0 0 Ronald L. Numbers 1977 'Do-It-Yourself the Sectarian Way', in Risse, 49-72. 1 0 1 Phyllis Hembry 1990, The English Spa 1560-1815, Social History (The Athlone Press, London). Douglas Mackaman 1998, Leisure Settings, Bourgeois Culture, Medicine, and the Spa in Modem France (The University of Chicago Press, Chicago and London). Roy Porter (ed) 1990, The Medical History of Waters and Spas (Medical History, Supplement No. 10, Wellcome Institute For the History of Medicine, London). 218 Hydropathy was designed to properly flush out stale fluids and any obstructions in the body by means of sweating or excretion. Water doctors also agreed that cold water constricts the skin's pores, thereby energising the circulation of the blood and strengthening the constitution. f Although not specifically connected with water cures, the influence of Western medical trends may be traced in Byoka suchi in the references to \"healing by nature\". It is Hirano's contention that perspiration, fever, diarrhoea, the formation of swellings, pus, and ulcers are all ways in which the \"natural function of the human body < \u00a3 > \u00a7 (hito no karada no karakuri )\" removes disease toxins. Fevers radiating from illness are all due to the natural function of the human body, which tries to eradicate illness. Fever is a tool for removing illness and a soldier on your side, therefore you should not attack it.1 0 2 This view is also expressed in such phrases as \"the function of vital energy of nature (genki shizen no hataraki )\", or \"function of nature f M A (ten ' nen no hataraki )\", which allude to the body's natural ability to repair itself. Conspicuously not belonging to the vocabulary of traditional medicine, these terms evoke the concept of natural therapeutics in the West. It is thus possible at least to surmise that the explanation of the water cure in Byoka suchi, regarding the pores of the skin, also reflects a certain influence from the West.1 0 3 It is possible to point out a certain conceptual overlap between Hirano's water cures and Western practices. Hirano argues that the stimulus of cold water strengthens the body's constitution. That is, water constricts the pores of the skin and energizes the circulation of ki, 1 0 2 BS 5:23. 1 0 3 For the influence of Western medicine on the concept of the healing power of nature in Byoka suchi , see endnote D to Chapter 3-3. 219 instead of blood as claimed by Western physicians. (2) Purification Secondly, water is able to cure mental disorders and skin diseases. As well as being physically cooling, water may have an effect of symbolic purification on the patient. In the ancient and medieval periods, illness was viewed in Japan as \"impure\", and water was applied to \"purify\" it.1 0 4 By the Edo period the association of disease and \"impurity\" had mostly faded, and been replaced by systematic pathology.1 0 5 However, although it is not explicitly mentioned, it seems possible to observe the idea of purification at work in the use of water for skin diseases and madness in Byoka suchi, probably fuelled by the stigmatisation of these diseases in Edo-period society. Madness (to be cured by water) is mostly attributed in Byoka suchi to cold damage or extreme yin disease. We find a great deal of evidence to show that skin diseases and madness were often stigmatised in Edo-period society. For instance, Tatsukawa (1998) observes that insane people were the object of both scorn and fear, and were often confined at home or in temples that functioned as asylums. In particular, Daiun-ji temple in Kyoto was famous as a place where the insane were sent for treatment by being placed under a waterfall there.1 0 6 This suggests an association between a stigmatised image of madness and purification by water. Byoka suchi does not clearly voice any negative view of madness, yet it admits that it is sometimes necessary to \"scold severely, beat, bind tightly, or confine at home\" 1 0 4 Takeda enumerates four aims of bathing in Japan: (1) religious purification, (2) the treatment of illness by the purifying effect of water, based on the concept that illness is \"impure\", (3) sanitaiy and hygienic purposes, and (4) pleasure. Takeda Katsuzo 1967, Furo to yu no hanashi (Koshinsho, Tokyo), 38-41. 1 0 5 Nonetheless, the practice of purifying diseases by means of water seems still to have been extant in Edo culture, mostly in the context of folk religions. 1 0 6 Tatsukawa Shoji 1998, Edoyamai no soshi (Chikuma shobo, Tokyo), 343-345. 220 those who are mad in order to suppress their excited souls # M .1 0 7 This statement implies that the insane were often treated harshly, and also abused in the name of treatment. On the other hand, the skin diseases referred to here are mostly leprosy, venereal ulcers and small boils. Among those suffering from skin diseases, lepers in particular experienced stigmatisation, being confined or expelled from their community on the grounds of their severe physical deformity. Byoka suchi considers leprosy to be the most fearful of contagious diseases, for the ancients called it the \"disease of te n k eib y o punishment from heaven . The second fascicle of Byoka suchi tells of a leper who cured his disease with pure water, taking refuge in the mountains and eating only vegetables and fruit. He was able to escape from his village because \"even relatives did not dare to come near him, let alone strangers\", and he lived in the mountain \"rather than disgracing himself at home\". This illustrates the stigmatisation of lepers and their exclusion from society.1 0 9 It was widely believed that lepers had strong sexual urges, as the disease was hereditary via \"inherent toxins\" from their parents. Consequently, leprosy gradually came to be regarded as the cause or transformation of other diseases, most typically syphilis.1 1 0 This popular view is also found in Byoka suchi, with the warning that L 0 / BS 6:23-24. 1 0 8 BS 5:12. 1 0 9 BS 2:7-8. Suzuki examines the theory that a strong fear of leprosy in the medieval period resulted in a heightened consciousness of the state of the skin's surface, which in turn helped promote the consciousness of cleanliness and the habit of daily bathing. Suzuki Noriko, '[Cleanliness] and Bathing in the Edo Era Japan', presented at Symposium on A History of Cleanliness/Purity (Institute of History and Philosophy, Academia Sinica, June 11-12,1998, Taiwan). Suzuki Noriko in Sakai, 1 1 0 Regarding the popular view of syphilis during the Edo period, a Portuguese missionary, Luis Frois (1532-1597), noted that \"in Japan, all men and women regard it (syphilis) as normal, and no one is ashamed of it\". This is cited in his letters, contained in Nichio bunka hikaku 0 in Daikokai jidai sosho, translated by Okada Akio 1965 (Iwanami, Tokyo, first edition, vol. 11), 587. While admitting the tragic aspects of the disease, Tatsukawa observes that people were generally open and tolerant about syphilis, due to the commonness of the disease (Tatsukawa 1998,176-198). On the other hand, Suzuki argues that syphilis patients were the target of 221 leprosy is sometimes a transformation of syphilis, which may originate in toxins inherited from the parents, created by their strong sexual desire. As for the association between leprosy and purification by water, the Arima M hot spring is said to have originated with the treatment of a leper (in fact, the Buddha incognito)1 1 1 . Drinking the holy water of the Asahi waterfall fU 0 (in present-day Toyama Hflil prefecture) was also a famous cure for leprosy. Such accounts are mostly found in legendary tales or folk religion. However it can be assumed that this purifying effect is also implied by the tale in Byoka suchi of the leper who was cured of his disease in the mountains by means of pure water. To summarize, the use water cures for mental disorders and leprosy (and possibly for other severe skin diseases too) is probably to be attributed not only to the empirical cleansing of the skin's surface or the cooling of the mind, but also to a pursuit of purification, which seems to have been fuelled by the stigmatisation of those afflictions in the popular view.1 1 2 (3). Against the abuse of medicines Thirdly, one of the merits of water cure lies in its convenience and simplicity. Byoka suchi contends in several places that one should try \"harmless\" water rather than indiscriminately resorting to medicine, which results in nothing but harm. This is based on the author's strong conviction that the prescription of medicine requires professional knowledge and experience, and should not be attempted by an amateur. relentless scom and discrimination, due to their disfigured features and the idea that they had a strong sexual drive. Suzuki Noriko 2005, 'Edojidai no igakusho nimiru baidokukan nitsuite', compiled toji to baidoku', in Fukuda and Suzuki, 67-99. 1 1 2 Regarding the stigmatisation of illnesses, Sontag (1990) famously points out that the leper in the Middle Age of Europe and the syphilitic in the late 19th and early 20th centuries were often associated with moral depravity, especially sexual desire in a social context. Susan Sontag 1990, Illness as Metaphor and AIDS and Its Metaphors (Anchor Books Doubleday, London) 58-59. 222 This emphasis on drugless modalities is intertwined with warnings about the dangers of the blind misuse of medicines and the problems caused by the uninformed judgment of laypersons. The usage of medicines, what to take and how to take it, requires proper knowledge of the true nature and efficacy of the various drugs. Lay people tend to think that fevers should be cooled down, while chills should be warmed up. However, the treatment and the prescription of drugs cannot conform to this amateur's view.1 1 3 There are many people who misunderstand the true nature of yin symptoms because of the name. They very often damage their life by taking the bulb of Carmichael's monkshood (PfTiP Aconitum carmichaelii), simply trying to warm up the chilled body as with a fireplace.1 1 4 Such warnings evoke a picture of the medical environment of the Edo period, where many unlicensed home-made drugs were available, while people had difficulty in finding doctors or at least competent doctors due to the multitude of quacks who did not know how to prescribe medicines correctly. For instance, Carmichael's monkshood, mentioned in the quotation above, contains large quantities of the alkaloid aconitine, a deadly poison, but Edo-period physicians sometimes dispensed it as a warming medicine. Rather than risking one's life by the misuse of drugs, it was far safer to try water cures. Even if not effective, at least water did no harm. 1 1 3 BS 2:37. 1 1 4 BS 5:22. 223 2-6-4. Summary Byoka suchi recommends the application of water for various symptoms, in the forms of listening, washing, hot bathing, spitting, imbibing, and affusing. The benefits of water cures are often attributed to the coldness of water, and its ability to stimulate the senses, energise the skin, constrict the pores of the skin (or open them, in the case of hot baths), and so on. Being yin in nature, water also establishes a balance between yin and yang symptoms, thereby restoring the body to health. The author's convictions about the extensive applications of water, though not further clarified, may be imbued with various ideas, such as naturopathy from the West and the need for purification in stigmatised diseases. Also rather than run the risk of amateurs prescribing inappropriate treatment or medicines, water is recommended as a \"harmless\" option. 2-7. Conclusion of Chapter 2 To conclude, Chapter 2 has presented a detailed analysis of Byoka suchi . In order to illuminate images of health and sickness in Byoka suchi , I have examined five key terms: karada (body), kokoro (mind), ham (abdomen), konare (digestion), and shaku (congealed clump), and three kinds of practices that seem to be given particular prominence in the text: dietetics, massage and water cures. Before narrowing my focus, however, I first gave a picture of the changing social, economic and cultural features of early nineteenth-century Japan, when the author Hirano Jusei lived and worked, and then of his personal background. Byoka suchi reflects the changing dynamics of the late Edo period, and Hirano Jusei's view of the body and illness epitomise the characteristics of the Japanese medicine of the time in many 224 ways - such as the emphasis on the abdomen as the centre of the body and mind, which conversely leads to the neglect of individual organs; the view of the good \"circulation\" of ki as the most crucial factor for preserving life, which is intertwined with the fear of ki stagnation within the body, and so on. Such practices as proper diet, breath regulation and massage are often directed at maintaining the smooth functioning of the abdomen. Hirano Jusei invented the method of breath regulation with abdominal massage, and recommended it almost as a panacea. Despite having a lot in common with other yojo texts of the time, Byoka suchi has developed some unique features of its own in terms of medical views and practices. Firstly the lack of reference to the spleen and stomach in Byoka suchi is rather unusual. Reflecting influences from Chinese medical tradition, particularly the treatise on the spleen and stomach of Li Gao, most yojo texts of the Edo period ascribe a central role in digestion to these two organs. On the other hand, the discussion of digestion in Byoka suchi is not concerned with where it takes place but how it is carried out, seeing it as the process of \"transporting and converting\" foods by the six fu. A close examination of the furigana in Byoka suchi enables us to recognise these differences more clearly. Through the simple act of appending the furigana hara to various Chinese-character compounds, the abdomen often comes to represents the entrails as a whole, or even more simply the interior of the body. Not only are the spleen and stomach conspicuous by their absence, but also in general, specific organs are rarely mentioned by name. Secondly, the fear of stagnation is particularly evident in Byoka suchi , as represented by illnesses like shaku and kan. The furigana- character collocations in Byoka suchi show that shaku and kan are often identified by a palpable clump in the 225 body that is habitual and chronic. Any excess of emotion, food or drink may be a potential cause of stagnation; thus dietary instructions, massage and water cures are all concerned with dispersing the core of the persistent pathogen. Thirdly, the application of water cures is undoubtedly unique to Byoka suchi . Although it cannot be further clarified, for one thing, the extensive use of water may be attributable to influences from the West, such as the idea of the \"healing power of nature\" or the trend of naturopathy. For another, water cures are favoured as a handy and harmless option for laypersons, avoiding the dangers of the misuse of medicine by amateurs. How can the above findings be related to the starting point of my analysis, that is, what do they reveal about the relationship between Chinese medical tradition, Japanese scholarly doctors, and lay readers? It is evident that Byoka suchi was written for the ordinary Japanese householder. For one thing, the text offers simple theories and easy practices, mostly based on Hirano Jusei's own experience and thinking. For another, furigana are intensively exploited as a reading aid and to facilitate the reader's understanding. Due to dependence on Chinese medicine, most of the technical medical terms in Byoka suchi are given in Chinese characters. Nonetheless, the author's interpretation of Chinese medicine is often reflected in certain gaps between the foreign and native connotations of furigana- character collocations. For instance, such key terms as hara, shaku, and kan in Byoka suchi belong to the everyday language of the Edo period, and the task of semantic reconstruction must take this into account. They are often appended as furigana to Chinese characters to flesh out Chinese medical knowledge for the general Japanese reader, while the Chinese characters seem to be deliberately chosen to reference complex underlying concepts of pathology and physiology. 226 Chapter 3. What a household with sick persons should know Translation of Byoka suchi , first fascicle 227 Footnotes As we have already seen in the previous chapters, most of the Chinese characters in Byoka suchi are provided with furigana \u2014 Japanese phonemic transliterations. Furigana do not merely indicate how a character or characters should be read. They also provide the author's translation of adopted technical terms and represent his efforts to digest their foreignness and render them into more familiar, everyday speech to facilitate reading for an audience of ordinary people. The furigana function then as a kind of gloss. As a result, furigana-ChinesQ character compounds effectively highlight Hirano's way of thinking about what is to be emphasised in discussing life, the body, and illness. In order to elucidate the text, my translation of the first fascicle of Byoka suchi basically follows the meaning of the author's furigana. Whenever the meaning of the appended furigana deviates from the conventional interpretation of the Chinese characters, or whenever the same reading has been imposed on different Chinese characters in different contexts or vice versa, I cite in footnotes the compound in the original text using following the format: (1) R: Japanese reading of the word, (2) C: Chinese characters, and (3) conventional denotation of the Chinese characters. Thus \"R\" stands for reading while \"C\" stands for characters. For instance, the karada footnote for the term JH Pf, which is translated as \"the body\" in accordance with the appended reading like this: R: karada . C: Hirff the intestines and stomach. that the term is read karada , \"the body\" in Japanese, while the characters BHH in the text literally denote \"the intestines and stomach\". This implies 228 an authorial emphasis on the abdomen as the pivotal part of the body. These footnotes reveal the interpretive role of the furigana , and enable us to appreciate the expressiveness of a text in which the combination of furigana and characters can carry ever-varying shades of meaning. Further annotation and commentary appear as endnotes at the conclusion of each section. Table 17.

From the diseases that prevail at the turning of the seasons1 , to those such as there are no illnesses that are not preventable if you try. This is much more so in cases of syphilis4 and venereal scabieslv , which are easily transmitted to others; of food damage5 v and vomiting and diarrhoea6 v i that occur due to incorrect practices of cultivating life7 ; and of the diseases that arise from too much drinking and too much love of women8 . Some people may know that you can ruin the body through catching a cold9 v \", dozing, alcohol and food, and hardships1 0 , but there are so many people, even among physicians nowadays, who think that seasonal epidemics, smallpox and measles are unavoidable. For those who are not in the field1 1 I find that it is understandable not to realise this. Therefore now for the sake of those people, I cannot help wishing to let them know about the reasons why, for those who are not yet ill, there is no unavoidable disease, which will also allow those who are already ill to access appropriate treatment.

Regarding the essentials to bear in mind about the cultivation of life1 3 , the first fascicle argues that you become healthy or develop disease depending on whether the five (factors) of dietetics, sleep, daily behaviour, breathing, and feeling1 4 are in harmony or not. It also discusses the harm that comes from using medicines blindly, and explains the basic points to keep in mind in sending for a doctor and requesting medicines in case of illness. Next comes the principle1 5 of why a disease is transmitted, and finally there are the three things to bear in mind for those who are engaged in nursing: The first is to prevent disease when there is no sign of it yet. The second is to cure the disease at its initial stage. The third regards devoting oneself to those whose condition is becoming serious1 6 , and the matters of concern when the patient's life is drawing to an end. In addition, the fascicle discusses the ideas of those who pray for a cure for disease, for such ideas will provide guidance1 7 for the household of a sick person. The second fascicle deals with experiments1 8 with poisonous foods, the reason why our country prohibits the consumption of animal meat, an outline of the good and bad effects of cereals, meats, fruits, and vegetables, and how to cure disease by means of food. The last part is a summary of misunderstandings about the efficacy of medicine due to having incorrect ideas1 9 . This section will cover the essential points for lay people to bear in mind. 1 2 R: sewayaki gokoro. C: pains. 1 3 . C: jL sH JUS principle. 1 6 R: omoru mono , C: J 5 & J dangerous. 1 7 R: tayori 9 R: ashiki kokoroe. conjecture. 235 The third fascicle deals with the main points to bear in mind about raising a child, the reasons why a mother should breast-feed her own children, and how breast milk can sometimes change the child's characteristics20. For mothers who cannot breast-feed themselves, there are things that should be kept in mind2 1 in choosing a wet-nurse. This fascicle further discusses the cultivation2 2 of the wet-nurse, breast-feeding a newborn baby, cases when there is not enough breast milk, the reason2 3 for dribbling and excretion in a newborn baby2 4 , and why vomiting milk is the most fearful disease2 5 1 . This fascicle briefly reveals that there are methods2 6 and medicines2 7 to save a child from convulsions2 8 lx , that most childhood diseases *JQoriginate in toxins inherited from the parents, and that there is a child disease called the \"worm\"x. At the end it mentions the origins of smallpox poison3 0 , and the essentials to bear in mind when nursing children suffering from smallpox, and gives an outline of chicken pox. The fourth fascicle discusses how women often develop chronic diseases3 1 owing to bad everyday conduct32, and how mistakes3 3 occur in care3 4 during 2 0 2 2 R\\yojo. C: and nurturing. 2 3 R: wake.

It will demonstrate, with illustrations to facilitate understanding, that disorders during 'in pregnancy, such as eclampsia, rigidity and urinary retention, may be treated even by a layperson. Regarding birth-inducing medicines39xi, care during childbirth, treatment after childbirth, dizziness, massive vaginal bleeding4 0 x 1 1 , and retained placenta4 1 x m , all that can be of use to the amateur is briefly mentioned. This fascicle is to be read in conjunction with \"What a midwife must study\"42. The fifth fascicle discusses how syphilis and venereal scabies were transmitted from foreign countries, and the way to prevent them. It clarifies the reasons for which, even if someone has already contracted these diseases, if it is recognised right away, the poison is easily cured and will not become widespread4 3. It gives details that even physicians might fail to see, once the disease has developed into various other diseases44. It is [then] difficult to get treatment, and the result for the patient may be a useless body4 5 due to medicines. Ringworm in the groin4 6 and experiments with moxibustion are mentioned. Next comes an outline of the issues concerning cold damage, seasonal epidemics, and catching cold. It deals with the different names [used for these illnesses] at present and in the past, mistakes regarding yin4 1 or yang4 8 symptoms due to wrong identification both by physicians 3 5 R: yoshi ashi . C: benefit and harm. 3 6 R: hara obi . C : soothing sash. 3 7 R: isu. C: birthing chair. 3 8 vaginal bleeding. R: toriage baba no kokoroe gusa. study). 4 3 R: habikoru . C: to become widespread. R'.ydshd. C: WiW. yang syndrome. 237 and laymen, mistakes in the use of medicines4 9 , and the signs of whether symptoms are serious or mild, curable or incurable. It teaches the essentials to be borne in mind in treating and nursing all those patients who have fever, summarised in the principle that all things in Heaven and Earth lie in balance5 0. It reveals that both diseases5 1 and treatments must follow the Way of nature. By showing this, I only wish to reduce the doubts of the amateur5 2. The fascicle then analyses the treatment of diarrhoea at its first occurrence and of severe poisoning. There have long been mistakes5 3 about the causes of diseases, and the views of the Chinese5 4 and the Dutch5 5 have done harm in recent times. It shows [all] the things to be borne in mind5 6 in a household where someone is sick. Also, as for beriberi5 7 , it is different from what is stated in such texts as QianjinfangS U xy and Waitai miyao 5 9 ; therefore many medicines for beriberi6 0 used since antiquity show no efficacy. Even if a disease appears to have been cured, it merely subsides along with the season6 1 . As time goes by, it becomes difficult to cure, and eventually turns into various other diseases. But by then there is no one who realises this, and people do not know that the treatment should have been different from the very beginning. These [matters] will make up the teachings for laypersons. 4 9 R: kusuri. C: ffjHi using 1 R: diseases. 5 2 C: the naive amateur. 5 3 R: machigae. misunderstanding. 5 4 R: Kara, C: tftJC China.

Those who have acute and severe symptoms sometimes die in an instant without even having time to request a doctor. So the things to remember in daily life will be explained one by one. Next comes discussion of the kinds of diseases that occur suddenly. These include sleeping sickness6 5 , acute apoplexy, paralysis*'', sudden collapse6 dizziness, fear of sleep, karT\\ madness, stiff shoulders3 \" 1 1 , nosebleeds, vomiting prolapsed 9 bums7 , choking on objects in the throat7 1 , dog bites, snake or worm bites, and rodent bites. The patients can all be saved if treatment is given immediately. The methods are shown briefly, facilitating understanding for the layperson. Among them, dog bite appears to be the mildest and easiest case, but neither doctors nor lay people have knowledge about it, leaving it until it becomes serious7 2 . Lamenting this, I wrote down without omission my own experience of long years. The following deals with ideas about cuts and bmises and techniques of bone setting, which can also serve as knowledge for samurai in case of emergency. So that, even though it is not my speciality, I just wrote down concisely the gist of what I have learnt from secret teachings here and there7 3 x v ,u since my youth, 6 2 R: kokoroe.

C: choking, 7 3 R: achi-kochi. C: V & W - various schools. 239 The order of the headings listed above may sometimes be incoherent74. However, this text was written just as the thoughts occurred to my mind, so that there is no deep intention of putting them in order. What I have missed out here, I wrote down there, and there are many omissions. Due to this, unless you read it from start to finish7 6 without missing anything, and cross-reference [items] together7 7, there may be some points that you will not be able to understand. Readers, do not laugh at this disorder . The seventh fascicle makes up the first volume of \"What a midwife must study\"7 9. It was not originally composed for the layperson. However I suppose that there is liable to be a shortage of midwives in the countryside, and there are also many women who die owing to difficult childbirth. Therefore if even lay people understand the contents8 0 discussed here, they will at times be able to save others. This fascicle first makes clear the shapes of the uterus8 1 and the placenta8 2 , the presentation of the foetus, how to ascertain pregnancy, and the pros and cons of the abdominal sash8 3 and chair8 4. It mentions everything that I would wish to teach midwives in detail. How to rectify the transverse position of the foetus, how to examine the uterus8 5 , due date of delivery8 6 , how to bring on labour8 7 , how to 7 4 R: wrongly placed. 7 5 R: meaning. 7 6 R : nokorazu yomi.

The character ^ (sitting) here implies childbirth. 8 7 R: ko wo umase. C: childbirth. 240 expel the afterbirth8 8 - these five secret methods are mentioned. It also sets out in detail ideas about the onset of labour8 9 . All the points are explained plainly so as to be comprehensible to midwives. The eighth fascicle makes up the second volume of \"What a midwife must study\". It contains methods to save women from disorders that occur before and after childbirth: morning sickness, constipation90, rigidity, eclampsia, sudden massive vaginal bleeding9 1 , and dizziness. As for the things that are easy for the layperson to carry out, they are presented in Byoka suchi instead. Here the main focus is on what I try to teach to midwives. Therefore I pick out and explain those techniques that are simple and easy to carry out, intending to allow midwives to master them completely by cross-referencing them here and there (in the text). The crux of this fascicle is a discussion about when to allow the [infant's] head to crown in difficult childbirth, when to deliver the arms or legs first, how one is unable to do anything but feel for the back in a sideways he , and errors in the controversy about twins now and in the pastx ix . It also describes thoroughly the secret techniques that enable mothers to give birth without the slightest damage, no matter how difficult the delivery is. These are Q * >techniques that no one has heard of before , which are easy both to carry out and to understand. As for those that cannot be fully explained in words, I have made them clear by means of illustrations. My original intention was to provide comprehensive teaching for the midwives of the world, thereby aiming at preventing the needless 8 8 R: nochizan . C: vaginal bleeding, 9 C: never existed before or now. 241 death9 4 of mothers and newborn babies. Thus these texts9 5 mention everything without any omission. This is an outline of the rubrics of all eight fascicles. Byoka suchi 9 6 was composed hastily in the first place, so that many things have been left out/There is more to be said, and there are discrepancies here and there. I may write a sequel volume to address these points at a later date. As to \"What a midwife should study\", I wrote it previously with the idea of publishing it separately. However people like midwives would not know that such a text existed, and few of them would wish to read it. Moreover, selfishness and obsession are the Usual nature9 7 of women, so there is no way to teach and guide them even if they happen to witness a household * O Rwith a sick person in it. Even if there happen to be some midwives who receive education, my power as an individual can hardly extend far into this huge world. If a household with a pregnant woman informs an invited midwife about a text like this, or guides those who are illiterate by reading aloud from it, they may be enlightened through listening to what is taught9 9 . If so, it would not only bring happiness to the household, but also it could possibly preserve quite a few pregnant women and newborn children in the world from disaster. Out of my perhaps officious kindness1 0 0 in thinking like this, finally I wish that everyone in the world will support my desire to publish the fascicles of this text together at a later date. 9 4 R: miiri jini.

In Byoka suchi , cold damage basically refers to all kinds of \"headache, fever, and chill\" due to \"being damaged by cold k f\\ However, the differentiation of cold damage from kanbo (cold) or jieki (epidemic fever in this context) remains problematic. In Byoka suchi it is argued that each must be attributed to a different evil poison II at the outset; therefore the symptoms and treatment must also be different. The author Hirano tries to explain that cold damage is infectious only among the family or within the neighbourhood C BS 5:16-34). n R: ekirei. C: epidemics. The character compound $\u00a3$5 refers to a type of epidemic which is highly contagious. According to the Byomei ikai (161) it is a disease due to seasonal ki or heat, caused by the disharmony of seasonal qi, unusual weather, tempest or undispelled fog. I I I R: ribyo . C: $tl diarrhoea. The character compound usually refers to diarrhoea in general, but it is classified with infectious diseases in Byoka suchi , which implies the possibility of dysentery. In fact dysentery occurred endemically during the Edo period, but it was often considered as severe diarrhoea. It was only after the dissemination of Western medicine that dysentery came to be recognised as a contagious disease. The recognition of diarrhoea (or dysentery) as contagious is mentioned in Byoka suchi , i.e. that one may become infected with diarrhoea by inhaling or touching the poisonous ki from a patient's bowel movements venereal scabies. The name traces to the popular opinion that the disease was initially transmitted from Hizen (present-day. Saga prefecture). In Byoka suchi , Hirano assumes that the disease is foreign in origin and that the first appearance of Hizen gasa (venereal scabies) is related to the geographical location of Hizen. Adjacent to Nagasaki, the only port opened to China and Netherlands, and a residential area for foreign traders, Hizen was very likely the first place that people contracted foreign diseases (BS.5: 12). v See chapter 2, section on konare \". V l I translate SSL as \"vomiting and diarrhoea\" according to its symptoms, because the interpretation of the term kakuran SSL is a complex issue. From around the middle of the nineteenth centuiy onward, it is often used as the equivalent of \"cholera\". However according to the account in Yuanhoulun , H SL (huoluan in Chinese) is due to the unbalance and conflict between warmth and coolness, and the two qi of yin and yang and of purity and muddiness (648). Despite the fact that this definition is also presented in such texts as Byomei ikai , and presumably was widely accepted in Edo-period medicine, many other understandings of kakuran existed in the Edo context. For instance Kagawa Shuan maintains that kakuran and shokusho (1st (U the same, (Ippondo koyo igen , 'shokusho H\u00a7jl;\\497). Moreover, Suzuki points out that even sunstroke and heat stroke are sometimes called kakuran in Edo popular literature (Suzuki Akira 2000, Edo no iryojuzoku jiten, Tokyodo, Tokyo, 7-8), On the other hand, Byoka suchi differentiates H i\u00a7 L from U til by causation. According to this account, the former ( kakuran ) never occurs unless the body is attacked by evil from without. SSL, regardless what one eats, always causes stomach ache, vomiting, and diarrhoea (BS 6:1). Food damage )\u00a7 \u00a3 (!? , on the other hand, often occurs due to the influence of external evil, but not always. Despite the variation of definition, it seems that SSL always involves acute vomiting and diarrhoea, vu Byomei ikai (59) defines Is&ll within a scheme of three grades of disorder due to external evil When one coughs, and the invasion of external evil is shallow, it is kanbo 1 0 1 R: Takuzenkyo . C: One of Hirano Jusei's pen names, a name for the place where Hirano lived. 243 When the invasion is deep, it becomes wind damage (shofu #\u00a3M), and when the invasion is even deeper and more prevailing, it becomes seasonal epidemic (un ' eki $I3\u00a7:). It seems that wind damage H S U S , is sometimes replaced by cold damage M M , as Byoka suchi also mentions that people tend to regard as the mild version of cold damage. Strictly speaking, \"feeling and being affected\" should be differentiated from cold damage in terms of causality and treatments (BS5: 18). Byoka suchi also uses the compound W M (being affected by cold), read as hiki kaze , in the sense of catching a cold (BS1:27). vm In Byoka suchi , we find \u00a3e, H i, and I E , all read sho. In traditional medicine nowadays, s ffl* refers to a single symptom, such as headache or constipation. In contrast, the concept of HE is akin to syndrome, which should be understood in correlation with the cause of disease. H is now usually regarded as an old, formal graphic variant of the character I E . However during the Edo period, $E, H , and I E are often used synonymously, and such is the case in Byoka suchi. According to Mayanagi, it was only after the Meiji period that the terms Se and EE became differentiated. It is suggested that this phenomenon probably occurred when was matched with the concept of \"symptom\" in European languages in the process of translation. Mayanagi Makoto 'sho to reading sashikomi on $ 0 ^ (epileptic convulsion). It is possible to assume that sashikomi in this text refers to hysteria or convulsions with sharp pain. 1 R: taidoku C: jfiil inherent toxin. Inherent toxins are considered to originate in the fire of the five viscera. They develop from such causes as the excessive consumption of foods with unbalanced flavours, irregular lifestyle, and feelings of worry, anger, sorrow and anxiety during pregnancy. Mediated by the mother's womb, the toxin affects the foetus and constitutes the cause of various diseases. For instance in Byoka suchi , smallpox and syphilis are sometimes attributed to inherent toxins from the parents. x R: mushi. H worm. People in the Edo period (including quite a few physicians) often thought that children's diseases were due to the \"worm\" (mushi). The concept of \"worm\" originates in Chinese medicine. For instance Yuanhoulun , section \"Zhuchong\" H A lists nine kinds of worm, involving both accurate observation and some imagination. This worm is differentiated from parasitic worms in the contemporary sense. From the pathological viewpoint, the \"worm\" is connected with heat and humidity, which are considered to breed worms. On the other hand, the idea of \"worm\" in the Edo context combined both medical theory and popular belief. That is, the human body is a hotbed of worms that naturally breed within it. This folk belief endures in Japanese idiomatic expressions, such as \"the worm is in the wrong place\" (someone is in a bad humour) or \"feeling an omen from the worm\" (having a feeling in one's bones). Here the metaphorical \"worm\" often incorporates both inner thoughts or feelings and a person's character. See Shirasugi Etsuo 1994, \"Senki and Kuriyama, 63-92. As a result, \"worm\" within the body came to be regarded as the cause of various symptoms that are typical of children, such as infant colic, diarrhoea, epilepsy, and fever. However, the author of Byoka suchi objects to this phenomenon of associating so many diseases with the \"worm\", claiming that the mushi at issue is not the term for \"worm\" - H (mushi) ~ but the one meaning \"steam\" M (mushi). This indicates that the temperature of a newborn baby is slightly high; thus it is misleading to confuse these two mushi of \"worm\" and \"steam\". Nonetheless convulsions and twitching in children do sometimes occur due to parasitic worms, which should be purged immediately (BS 3:23-24). These statements suggest that in Byoka suchi , Hirano tries to differentiate parasitic worms, which have physical existence, from the vulgar view of the \"worm\" to which people blindly attribute any children's illnesses. X 1 Byoka suchi objects to the usage of drugs to induce labour, seeing them as against nature. Kagawa Gen'etsu also maintains that any drugs of this kind are merely nonsensical, but he still finds it reasonable for a woman in labour to take medicine in order to promote the circulation of ki and blood (Sanron, 15). For instance he gives a recipe for a 'decoction for inducing childbirth PAilj', which is also cited in Wanbing huichun (by Gong Tingxian 1587). It is to be used when an expectant mother feels pain in her abdomen and back, and the waters 244 have broken. It is made from fried Rosaceae recipe says: Prepare one qian (approximately 5g) of each, and take the decoction. Wanbing huichun, reprint 1984 (Renmin weisheng chubanshe, Beijing), 397. xu ItM mainly refers to three symptoms: vaginal discharge, sudden irregular uterine bleeding, or oozing. The reading \" dokkarF , which is an onomatopoeic term conveying ideas of \"massive and sudden\", indicates sudden, heavy bleeding from the uterus. !fl\" In pre-modem Japan, the placenta was considered a sacred part of the baby's life, particularly of the soul. A widely prevalent custom was to bury the placenta in such places as a cemetery, near a stable or lavatory, under the central pillar of the house or under the eaves. This suggests that the afterbirth contained both sacred and impure aspects. On the cultural study of afterbirth in Japan, see Tsukuba Daigaku Minzokugaku Kenkyushitsu (ed) no minzoku (Yoshikawa Kobunkan, Tokyo), Teiri and Kiyoshi Yokoi 1998, Mato to ena no shi (Heibonsha, xlv Qianjing yaofang discusses beriberi in juan seven: Jiaoruo (weak legs) is considered to be beriberi. The disease is attributed to being affected by the wind poison of a locality, where cold, heat, wind and humidity all create vapour. A person's feet always come into contact with that vapour, and this results in being infected by wind poison (Qianjing yaofang Tunfeng duzhang diyi 162-181). On that the ancient malady of \"weak legs\" differs from the contemporary variety in terms of causality despite the resemblance in symptoms. The ancient \"weak legs\" affects the legs first, and is spread by infectious poison transmitted from person to person, while contemporary beriberi begins from various parts of the body, depending on the individual. In addition it is not infectious. The cause is traced to the inner problem associated with each type, particularly congealed poison fH # within the body due to idleness. This analysis of beriberi evidently involves the pathology of stagnation and ideas of the virtue of hard work. See also Part 2, section on shaku. R: sotchiibu. C: stroke. R: ruichubu. C: mild paralysis. The reading sotchiibu is more conventionally applied to which usually refers to stroke. The literal meaning of ^ here is \"acute\", while indicates a disease where wind is the pathogen. Similarly the reading ruichubu for WtW (mild paralysis) can be applied to Byomei ikai (45) defines ruichubu as symptoms resembling paralysis, where the body is affected by such factors as fire, wrong ki, damp, cold, heat, or where the symptoms are due to excessive eating or sexual intercourse, languor, and foul circulation of ki within the body. From the combination of the literal meanings of H - \"similar\" or \"a kind\", and $ $! - \"mild\" or \"slow\", it is possible to infer that ruichubu refers to non-acute symptoms that are similar to paralysis in a broad sense. X V I R: tenkan. C: epilepsy or seizure. usually refers to seizure, while refers to spasms. However I do not translate kan, because definitions of kan 3 fS inthe Edo context vary widely. Byoka suchi takes the view that kan occurs due to the separation of the mind from the body, and kan disease may develop into almost all kinds of mental disorders (BS 6:20-21). For the detailed pathology of kan, see chapter 2, \"massage\". xvn R: haya uchi kata. C: sudden stiffness in and around the shoulders. The exact meaning of haya-uchi-kata is unknown. Byomei ikai (98) states that kenbeki is also called uchi-kata, which refers to the symptoms of stiffness at the top of the shoulders. Some people say that the name uchi-kata derives from the idea that one feels comfortable when tapped (uchi fT tb) on the shoulders (kata M), while others suggest that the symptoms are formed within (uchi 1 * 1 ) the shoulders (kata M). (Haya) uchi-kata or kenbeki appears in Edo texts as an everyday ailment, what is now understood as kata-kori, \"stiff shoulders\". Despite the fact that the Japanese have by now been complaining about uncomfortable stiffness and pain in the shoulders for several hundreds of years, Kuriyama points out that this phenomenon is scarcely shared at all by other cultures. Chinese medical texts like Huangdi neijing, Shanghanlm, or Nanjing contain ^ and 3#, but the term 31,3# (xuanpi in Chinese) is principally recognised as a symptom which appears around the abdomen or ribs. Moreover the term is basically limited to the medical context, and there is no the tendency to acknowledge it as an everyday complaint. See Kuriyama 245 Shigehisa 1997, 'Katakori ko', in Yamada and Kuriyama, 37-62. See also Chapter 2, \" shaku \". x v n I From the late fifteenth to the early seventeenth century, Japan experienced a succession of local wars and battles. Several schools of surgery appeared, which later divided into two specialities: those that treated external problems in general, including skin diseases, and those that treated incised wounds like cuts and stabs. The Yoshimasu l=fi\u00a3\u00a3 school and Takatori JU B X schools are well known as belonging to the latter, called {kinso) physicians. Latere with the encounter with Western medicine, other schools of suigery developed during the Edo period. One, called Nanban literally \"south barbarian\") school, was drawn mainly from the tradition of Portugal or Spain. The other was mainly transmitted through Holland, and was called the Komo ($T4s, literally \"red hair\") school. See nitsuite', in Yamada and Kuriyama, 231-64. ** According to a commonly accepted theory about the position of twins in the womb, one was in a foot presentation, and the other was in a head presentation.

Instructions in the principles of cultivating life1 (ByOka suchi fascicle 1: page 7-20) According to an old saying, laziness and arrogance lead to poverty, and f diligence and thrift1 1 bring wealth. This point is the crux of cultivating oneself and preserving the family, and the Way of cultivating life7 lies nowhere else. The reason is that, if you do not neglect your duty2 by day and by night, the body's3 digestion4 1 1 1 will be good5, and you will not be bothered6 by wearing heavy clothing7 , eating too much or drinking too much8. As the proverb says, flowing water does not become fetid and the hinges of a door do not rot. This is because they are in motion. If you wish to live free from disease and yearn for happiness, two things are paramount: duty9 and thrift. In order to remain steadfast in these two, fearfulness is paramount. Fearfulness means fearing the order of Heaven. If one maintains a fearful, modest heart in every undertaking, dangers will pose no peril, and there will be no room for blunders. Fear that drinking to excess will harm your body1 0 . Fear that gorging yourself with delicacies will disturb1 1 the digestion1 2 in your abdomen1 3 . Fear that unbridled sexual desire will diminish1 4 your vital essence1 5 . Fear that your 1 R: yojo no kokoroe o toku. C: Instruction in the of cultivation of life. tsutome.

C: being enfeebled and worn down. 1 5 R: seiki. C: vital essence, ^ is synonymous with zhengqi right qi), as they are described: (Suwen, 'tongpingxhushilun' 173-4). In 247 family will be ruined if you indulge in these things and neglect your family business1 6 . Fear that your fortune will collapse, if you spend too much money. Fear that if you persist in indulging yourself thus, there will be no limit to your greed, you will envy others' wealth, and be unable to repay your debts. Fear the public disgrace you will suffer and the anger you will incur. Fear that your descendants will follow the example of your bad behaviour1 7 , and the family will eventually invite downfall1 8 . If you behave wrongly in this way, you will not only become sickly1 9 , but you will also bring upon yourself the wrath of heaven, the blame of your masters and parents, and the censure of society. You yourself will gradually decline and finally end up ruined in body with your family in shambles. How can one not be utterly fearful? If you acknowledge this reasoning, you should be deeply fearful and circumspect, and you should be tenacious in thrift and diligence2 0. Each body has received a fixed endowment from Heaven. Striving to husband2 1 this is the priority in the cultivation of life.2 2 Regarding staple foods in daily life, you need not adhere to strict prohibitions on (anything that suggests) poison2 3 when you are not even ill, saying that this food is harmful or that one is beneficial. Those whose minds are at ease with thrift are the context of reproduction it also refers to semen: ^\u00a7\u00a331^ (Suwen, * shanggutianzhenlun' 5), 1 7 R: ashiki f f depraved behaviour. 1 C: bad decline. 1 9 R: body. However the reading yamai (illness)-7\u00aboc/j/ (to have/possess) is conventionally written as which has the connotation of a person who is suffering from habitual diseases. It implies the assumption that leading a depraved life results in various kinds of lifestyle diseases. 2 0 R: tsutome. C: to exert. 2 1 R: kuinobasu. C: f&iln thrift and stinginess.

C: to prohibit strictly. 248 satisfied with plain foods as their daily diet. Tasty food24, if eaten occasionally, will seem particularly delicious and also be more nourishing to the body2 5 than if you are always replete with tasty foodlv . When those who work tirelessly2 6 at their family business occasionally have a day of leisure and treat themselves with something they enjoy, it is vastly more relaxing for the mind and beneficial for the body than indulging in extremes of pleasure day and nightv. The evil poisonsv l attacking you from without2 7 can be compared to an enemy besieging your castle. Diseases that result from disobeying the way of cultivating life can be compared to allies who betray you. When those traitors are inside the castle, they communicate with the enemy, and bring destruction on the castle. What a frightening thing. One may be surrounded on the outside by an enemy of the most noxious sort; but if the inner guards are stalwart, the heart of the castle is united. Provisions2 8 and weapons are not lacking, and the reinforcements of medicine are appropriate, so there should be no trouble in expelling the enemy and hemming them in from within and without. A good warrior of ancient times said that timeliness brings victory7 1 1 . To prevent harm when there is no sign of it yet, and to prepare2 9 before disaster comes, those are the supreme tactics. The first step consists in striving hard to suppress desire. Although suppressing desire seems difficult, once it becomes habitual and usual, it is quite easy. With a heart that fears the harm to come, you measure the quantity, however little it is, and do not eat as much as you indesire. Even more so with women and alcohol. When you are fearful and 2 4 R: ajiyoki mono, C: offer fragrant delicacies. 2 6 7 attack from without. 2 8 R: hydro. C: rice and millet. 2 9 R:yoi. C: fit to supply. 3 0 R: on 'na. C: women's charms. 249 circumspect in the first place, there is no way to commit a blunder. This indicates that enormous disasters come from momentary impatience. Even among those who say that they overlook nothing3 1 in cultivating life3 2 , only a few are truly versed in it. Monkshood3 3 resembles potatoes3 4 in appearance, but knowing it is poisonous, they dare not eat it even if forced. Precisely because they know the five cereals are essential to nourish the body3 5, they seek them out to eat. It is because they truly know about monkshood and the five cereals. If distinguishing goodness from evil is just like knowing about monkshood and the five cereals, there should be no blunders. However people who truly know this are so rare. Most people, being unable to suppress even the slightest desire, will eventually invite harm and suffer such disasters that no regret can repair. What a stupid but also pitiful and lamentable thing. Now in order to save people from such vanity3 6 , the true outline of nurturing life5 7 will be taught as follows. Even if one aspires to wealth, success in enlightening studies or the accomplishment of heroic deeds, these are ambitions impossible to achieve if the *30 *3Qbody is sickly . What should be fim is not fun. Therefore what can wealth, glory, talent and virtue be worth if your body4 0 is sickly4 1 ? Just being healthy is a human being's greatest fortune in this worldly existence Therefore people who possess ambitions should know this above all. 31 R : n u k e m e .

If you eat too much and feel sated, the abdomen4 4 becomes bloated, digestion4 5 is poor, the body4 6 gradually weakens47, and the circulation4 8 of the blood4 9 becomes bad50. The congealed clumps that occur in the abdomen5 1 become knotted into shaku> the spirit5 2 becomes depressed and you do not feel at ease in your daily routine. This will be the cause of serious diseases. Apart from this, foods that are hard, sticky, heavy, or foul-smelling, and foods that are too sour, salty or spicy are all regarded as unbalanced flavours, so you should not eat a lot of them. If you have a liking for eating them, your body5 4 will be ruined by their poison without your knowing it5 5 . In addition, when your body5 6 is overheated, eating many cold things will disturb the r\u00bb 7 e g r ncondition of your body and may stir up diseases . It is the same with eating things that are too hot when the body6 0 is cold.

Nonetheless, cold foods alone cannot constitute the nourishment for the body , so you must be concerned that your daily foods are not too cold or too hot, but just in between. Furthermore it is extremely harmful to acquire a taste for eating unfamiliar food as a delicacy, even without recognising its nature. Nothing can be more undutiful to your parents or disloyal to your masters than harming your body6 4 , ruining your whole life due to your appetite, and becoming a laughingstock for the world. Eating gluttonously without reflecting6 5 on the cause and effects6 6 is the behaviour of birds and beasts. You should know6 7 that even birds and beasts naturally avoid the things that are harmful to them, as seen in the horse that differentiates6 8 wild plants, and dogs and cats that can tell foods by smell. Being bom a human being, how can you not be ashamed of behaviour that is inferior even to that of the birds and beasts? Alcohol is a particularly extreme with regard to unbalanced flavour, and its nature is so fierce that it does not freeze even in extremely cold weather. Drinking alcohol to excess brings little benefit but much harm. It not only does harm to the body6 9 , but also ruins the family and weakens the nation. In eight or nine cases out of ten, the harm is wrought by alcohol. How can you not be circumspect and abstain? Temperance in eating and drinking is the way towards right conduct7 0 and the 62 R : m i . C : M b o d y . 63 R : mi.. C : M b o d y . 64 R : k a r a d a .

So you should never act just as you please, but be patient and suppress desire. Next you should be temperate in sleeping. Indulgence in sleeping7 2 occurs in the lazy mind, and it is the cause of various diseases. The spirit7 3 of people who sleep a lot gradually darkens, and their consciences become dull7 4. Be fearful and deeply cautious. Nonetheless it is wrong to sleep too little and to keep oneself from sleeping. You should make a rule appropriately, and there should be no excess or lack. The moderate amount is from four and one-half hours to five and three-quarter hours in winter, and six and three-quarter hours in summer1 . It is good to go to bed early in the evening and get up before sunrise in the morning. A nap, worst of all things, is not good. Eating too much induces sleep; but going to bed immediately after eating is most harmful to the body7 5 . Sleeping when drunk with alcohol as a rule7 6 will shorten your life, so you should be most prudent [about this]. Next you should correct your bodily7 7 posture78, and then harmonise the breath.1 X In adjusting the body7 9 , it is good8 0 to sit up straight. It is bad if the spine curves forward. Leaning backwards is also not good. The head is to be held upright, making a straight line from the navel to the nose, being neither crooked nor bent nor craned upward, nor facing down. It is good to stretch8 1 the neck. Regarding the shoulders, it is good to be keep them low and bad to be hunched. Keep the eyes still, 7 1 R: mi. C: # body. 7 2 R: amari ni mmuru.

It is good to make a space about the size of a chicken's egg under the armpits. All your concern should lie in pushing the lower abdomen8 2 forward at the waist. As you do so, strength accumulates under the navel, file lower o<jabdomen becomes replete with ki, the breath reaches under the navel, and nothing obstructs8 4 the chest, the ribs, and the pit of the stomach8 5 . You feel that the power of the whole body is in the area under the navel and the waist8 6. Once this gradually becomes habitual, you will be able to do it naturally without any effort, and will not be aware of the breath coming and going through the throat. The breath goes out through the nostrils, enters8 7 under the navel, and is expelled through the nostrils again when issued from under the navel. Afterwards it also wafts out from the ears and exits from the pores of the skin 8 8 . Downy hairs on the ears of people who have lived long are a sign that the breath is harmonised and the mind8 9 is at peace. It is good to shut the mouth completely. In all actions, | the upper and lower lips are always to be kept together. This method gradually cures such symptoms as kan and various other symptoms, including stiff shoulders, rush of blood, dizziness, choking9 0 in the chest and the 8 2 R: shita hara .

You can apply this point9 3 in every daily action9 4. When you walk, the hands should be drawn close to the body9 5 and held downward, with the four fingers flexed, clenching the thumbs into the fist. When you do so, ki will naturally fill the area under the navel, and you will feel strength around the waist. Your step will be light with no stumbling. When you study this ceaselessly, you will realise that the action of walking lies in between the waist and crotch, not in the legs. When you sleep, lie on your right side, and extend the right leg, with the left one uppermost and bent. Keep the hands down close to the thighs, push the lower abdomen9 6 forward, focus the mind on the soles of the feet, and move9 7 the big toes seven or eight times. Meanwhile do not allow any other thoughts9 8 to stir. If other thoughts arise, it is also good to fall asleep reciting Buddhist names or sutras\" in your mind1 0 0 . Or when you go to sleep, first lie on your back, stretch both legs and calmly stroke downward from the chest and ribs to the lower abdomen1 0 1 with both hands several dozen times. Then stroke from the hinge joint of the waist to the thighs, stretching both hands as far as they will go, several dozen times. Afterwards slowly move the big toes. All the time that you are stroking the chest and ribs, do it lightly, then moderately from the pit of the stomach to around the navel, and firmly towards 9 1 R: ki no fusagi.

Regarding the quality of attention in this stroking action, it is good to take care to do so very quietly and not carelessly, like an artist painting1 0 3 with colours, or like someone holding a bowl of boiling water. Afterwards sleep on your right side, and with the abdomen1 0 4 replete. Such methods as these' are also excellent. When you wake up in the morning, do not get up from the bed abruptly. First sit upright and shake the body1 0 5 and every joint several times, then place both hands in your lap. Now open your mouth, and exhale breath1 0 6 slowly three or four times, and then shut the mouth and let breath1 0 7 enter through the nostrils*1 so that it reaches under the navel. Stop after doing this more than a dozen times, and get up in a leisurely fashion. This is especially good for kan 1 0 8 symptoms, habitual shaku0 9 and diseases related to women's blood1 1 0 . All these chronic diseases can be cured without recourse to drugs by persisting with this method and carrying it out constantly morning and night. As for those illnesses that people regard as hard to cure, such as paralysis1 1 1 , numbness of the limbs and waist, and all complex 11 * ydiseases , following this method sometimes shows efficacy. Extending this approach to some kinds of twitching1 1 3 and fright wind in children [infantile 1 0 2 R: shita hara. C: /hUH the lower abdomen. 1 0 3 R: irodoru. C: IS to set up. 1 0 4 R: hara.

As for all those people who have habitual diseases1 1 5 , when they go to sleep, they should in particular calm the mind1 1 6 , banish all thoughts, and concentrate on the place under the navel being replete with ki. The efficacy of going to sleep like this is often far greater than that of ordinary medicines. What is described here is an outline. Even in the midst of arts and work, and 1 1 7between meals and socialisation , if you adhere to these concerns and practise ceaselessly, not only will dignity naturally become established and the body1 1 8 become healthy, but also wisdom and discretion1 1 9 will gradually increase and courage will gather. This is the method of harmonising the mind starting out from forms1 2 0 . Next after this, you should learn how to harmonise the mind. This aims to store dispersed ki so as to fill the inner abdomen1 2 1 , and to make the mind1 2 2 relaxed1 2 3 and composed, thereby allowing it not to be blindly deceived or upset by things. In general, the human body1 2 4 is invariably healthy and free of diseases if the upper part is light1 2 5 , and the lower part is relaxed5 1 1 1 1 . Even if there are sufferings1 2 6 occasioned by evils from without1 2 7 , many of them should be cured before they 1 4 R: kan. C: fit spasm. 1 5 disease. 1 6 R: kokoro. # spirit. 1 C; reception.

However if the mind is constantly out of control and upset, the chest and stomach are gradually pulled upwards. The organs become wrongly positioned, shaku is formed, and convulsions occur. The vessels are apt to flow backward towards the upper part, so that it could even end in a situation where the power of medicine and acupuncture are unable to reach them. Pondering the cause of upset in the mind, it is thus: Greedy thoughts continue ceaselessly, so that one suffers in yearning, fears in obtaining, and gets angry in losing. In all things, there is nothing that does not trouble the mind, and as days pass and years go by, it becomes 1 7 0gloomy and inharmonious. Gradually the digestion of foods becomes impeded, and the circulation1 3 0 of blood1 3 1 becomes bad1 3 2 , so that the vital energy7 3 3 that governs the whole body1 3 4 loses its role. The inner defence is not strict and the force that defends it outwardly is enfeebled, therefore evil from without1 3 5 will find it easy to seek an opening. Moreover, when worry136, anger137, ostentation1 3 8 and irresponsibility1 3 9 succeed one other continuously, you will tolerate1 4 0 them in yourself, regarding them as your own innate characteristics. Thus congealed diseases1 4 1 firmly take root, and eventually no treatment will show efficacy. Now as to the causes of what people call 1 2 8 R: hari. C: ^ stone. 1 2 9 R: konare.

C: difficult diseases that are congealed and habituated, and fail to be cured. 258 kan,m the propensity to shaku1 4 3 , and all difficult diseases1 4 4 , they are not yet clarified. I know for certain that some of these result from disharmony in the mind, so that medicine has no efficacy. Hence for these I have taught people to regulate the body1 4 5 and breath, to cure those diseases through forms1 4 6 . This has often achieved efficacy. Furthermore I have instructed ordinary people and women in the method of massaging the body1 4 7 while chanting songs. Making them carry this out has cured longstanding diseases and shown better efficacy than medicine. Yet this is a short-cut method1 4 8 , and in fact, both the body1 4 9 and breath are, from the beginning, the surface of the mind. Just as a shadow follows substance, and an echo responds to sound, they are inseparable. If you can just harmonise the mind, in the natural course of things, you will follow the principle [of the true cause of the disease], and you will not have to harmonise the body and breath separately. There is an old saying that a broad mind makes for an ample bodyx lv This is tantamount to saying that, if the mind is unaffected by events1 5 0 and composed, the characteristics1 5 1 that fill the inside are also revealed on the surface. The function of the body1 5 2 becomes natural and relaxed, the form1 5 3 righteous, and the behaviour modest. Furthermore, according to fortune tellers, those whose minds are gloomy and worried bow their heads and exhibit a cloudiness between the eyebrows and the 1 4 2 R: kansho. C: spasmodic syndrome. 1 4 3 R: C: WM clump and bump. The appended furigana ki here has the connotation of \"inclination\" or \"habitual\", thereby the compound stresses that some people are considered to have an innate susceptibility to shaku, or to suffer from shaku habitually. 1 4 4 R: kojire yamai.

People who display such features have characters that are not lively and are not at all decisive. In case of illness, they often fall into a critical condition. On the other hand, those who suit the current of the time hold their heads high; their napes are long, their shoulders are extended, their eyes and the mouth are lustrous, and their behaviour is graceful. As for people of deep wisdom, their gaze appears clear, and their chest and abdomen1 5 4 are relaxed. They say that people with such features are able to put up with any crisis without being wearied, and eventually they can turn trouble into good fortune, and accomplish all things. It is all about knowing the nature of the inner mind by observing what appears on the surface. It is similar to the [diagnostic method of] \"seeing\" among the so-called four diagnoses1 5 5 of physicians, which aims to determine diseases from what appears in the complexion.5 \" So revealing is appearance that even if you can hide the wickedness in your mind and try to look like an honest person on the surface to deceive ordinary people, you should not only fear that it will be obvious to everyone, but also that a superior person can discern the goodness or evil within your mind just by looking into your eyes. Also you cannot possibly deceive your own mind. In solitude, with no eyes to see you or [ears to] listen to you, you should reflect on what you think and what you crave for within your mind. Moreover, think of your responses when socialising with others. The words that issue from your mouth, do they really coincide with the thoughts in your mind or not? If I look at the reflection in the mirror of the mind, I will know clearly what is 1 5 4 R: hara. C: M the abdomen. 1 5 5 R: shishin . C: E3# four diagnoses. 260 good or evil, black or white. It is the soul1 5 6 that is the mysterious thing in my mind that knows this. The soul is neither bom nor can it die. It can see despite being formless and hear despite being soundless, and I cannot even guess how subtle it is. Although I have taken it as mine, it dwells only temporarily in this \"body1 5 7 , 1 fOgoverning the vital essence , making me mhale and exhale the air, and preserving warmth, life, and function1 5 9 . Its virtue flows through Heaven and Earth, and its form1 6 0 is the same as the fierce gods1 6 1 . If even an ounce of evil thought arises from my mind, it is impossible to disguise it by any resources of my own. What I know is also known to Heaven and Earth, and to the fierce gods. Heaven and earth and the fierce gods already know this, therefore they never fail to exact retribution, waiting for the time when the number given by Heaven comes to fruition. This originates in the correspondences of the one ki 1 , and is nothing to be wondered at. So mysterious and enigmatic is the soul1 6 2 that it knows things that are far away, makes no mistake in remembering1 6 3 what has happened in the past, and makes no error in foreseeing what is yet to occur in the future. No sooner has it heard of goodness, than the soul knows what that goodness is; and no sooner has it seen evil, than it considers what that evil is. This does not depend entirely on the difference between the wise and the foolish. Even though it is impossible to deceive oneself and one's own mind, we cannot possibly say that even a man of great virtue has no desires, for he has such impediments as the eyes, ears, nose, tongue, and the flesh, that is, the body1 6 4 , which 1 5 6 R: tamashVi. !\u00a7\u00a3# 1 C: bodily carapace.

Although the eyes, ears, nose, tongue, and flesh are in origin the servants of the mind, at its beck and call, they are endowed with certain desires: beautiful colours for the eyes, pleasant odours for the nose, a hearty appetite for the tongue, and warmth and softness for the flesh. They know no satisfaction, and eventually they end up enjoying vain prosperity, boasting in the world, and despising others on the strength of their authority. It is just like being among the misty clouds, not distinguishing the four directions, and walking along a steep path at dead of night without a lantern; and in the end they do not know whether other people are good or evil. What an dreadfully dangerous thing this is. Making the mind the servant of form1 6 5 instead of the other way round, is like turning the hierarchy of lord and followers upside down. You should know that through such an overthrow of the mind, the balance1 6 6 of the inner abdomen1 6 7 goes awry, leaving the body1 6 8 suffering from difficult and complicated diseases, so that few people can fulfil their Heaven-given lifespan. Now I will give an overview of the diseases that arise from a disharmonised mind.

If they do not have those [symptoms] listed above, they sometimes spit or discharge blood. As for people who are depressed and unable to rid themselves of worries, let alone shaku blockage1 8 1 , they end up with kan1 8 2 , paralysis1 8 3 , beriberi1 8 4 , numbed limbs, asthma, consumption, abdominal swelling1 8 5 , vomiting, stifling in the 1 f l Adiaphragm, blockage in the chest , and back pain. Women will have blood-related diseases187, madness1 8 8 X V I U , bloody discharge, miscarriage, infertility, irregular menstruation, and [conditions] such that the children they bear cannot grow up. What people call stagnated drink1 8 9 x ix is also produced by the same causes, and some have bad digestion1 9 0 or from time to time acute vomiting and diarrhoea. Furthermore you should grasp the outline by referencing both the section on instructions for nursing at the end of this chapter and the section on food prohibitions in the second chapter, and collating them. Apart from these it is impossible to count beforehand all the diseases that arise from the disharmonised mind. As for those 1 7 6 R: hikitsuri. C: convulsions. 1 7 7 R: kata-se kowari.

C: 'F'fh not to digest. 263 whose mind is harmonised and whose body1 9 1 is relaxed, they neither suffer from uncontrollable flushing, nor the agitation of restless and turbulent ki and blood1 9 2 x x . Nor do they suffer from impediments in the digestion1 9 3 of the abdomen1 9 4 or the function1 9 5 of the pores of the skin1 9 6 , which are caused by depression, worry, sorrow, shock, fear, weariness, and exhausted ki. Vital essence1 9 7 accomplishes its 10Rrole of protection , so that none of the various diseases mentioned above will ever arise. Moreover for those who know what contentment is, and leave their destiny to the order of Heaven, and whose feelings are not moved by their own glory or by worldly praise and censure, their mind is stable and calm. Therefore both their body1 9 9 and mind are naturally in harmony, and neither blinded nor upset even in moments2 0 0 of joy, rage, sorrow, or enjoyment. Most probably, they will not ruin their body2 0 1 , or waste their Heaven-given lifespan. Now it is said that if you wish to suppress the causes of disease and to stay healthy, there is no better way than renouncing desire and harmonising the mind202. However there are people who destroy the self2 0 3 due to selfishness2 0 4 , get illnesses from unknown causes, and suffer hardship through an unworthy way of living in this world. Even if they happen to be in a high place or highly paid, they can hardly be 1 9 1 R: karada. body. 9 2 R: iso-iso gui-gui. C: excessive turbulent anger. 1 9 3 R: konare.

What has been discussed in this section is the teachings of the ancient sages on how to nurture the body2 0 5 and how to regulate the mind. In addition, the argument about harmony among these five - foods, sleep, the body2 0 6 , the breath, and the mind2 0 7 - is not something that I have newly constructed. I think that physicians' treatment of illness is not alien to this approach either. Thus I have set out to teach in this outline the simplest and clearest things for the sake of lay people. Yet if anyone still finds these hard to understand and to practise, they should first learn and try to set the limits of foods and sleep, or try to control form2 0 8 and breathing. You may follow your own preference according to what is easiest to practise. For those who find even this difficult, the method of chanting songs and stroking the body20 9 , if carried out assiduously over a period of time, can yield benefits, thereby naturally attaining harmony among the five. The reason for this is that these five matters all belong to nothing other than the inner body2 1 0 of the self, and they are not discrete or separable. It is easy for the wise, because they understand the true theory and accomplish it from the inside out, whereas it is hard for ordinary people, because they are adhere to techniques2 1 1 and try to accomplish it from the outside in. Yet let us leave it to each person's convenience. There may be different paths from the foot of the mountain.

However they are sometimes difficult for women and children to practise. What is described here is the way of massaging the body2 1 6 while chanting songs, which entails no extraordinary performance. It is easier to carry out even for women, children, and the old whose 01Hbodies are becoming weak, and its efficacy is also remarkable. The method is as follows: After finishing all the day's work2 1 8 , go to the toilet, change into your nightwear, calm your mind, and enter your bed chamber. Lie down on your back, relaxing the area around the shoulders and the neck, lowering both hands alongside the body2 1 9 , stretching out both legs, and making the whole body2 2 0 free of any [ki] stagnation. Your body2 2 1 should appear as if it were dead. First open the mouth and breathe out from under the navel seven times. Then shut your mouth and close your eyes, calm your mind, and stroke downwards from the chest and ribs to the lower abdomen thoroughly with both hands while you chant songs thrice seven times. This is the first method. Afterwards from the top of the thighs to the joints of the waist, both the inner and outer sides towards the knees, stroke firmly downwards in 2 1 3 R.Kada.

Then stretch both legs and move the big toes while chanting songs seven times. This is the third step. As mentioned above, when you have finished all this, having calmly chanted songs thirty-five times, remain as you were, with the whole body relaxed and nowhere strained. Then inhale through the nostrils and quietly make the breath reach below the navel thrice seven times. All the time just concentrate on the breath reaching below the navel, and let go of all other thoughts. Counting each time, let the breath go in and out through the nostrils and never open the mouth at all. Some of those who are prone to suffer from shaku2 2 3 say that the breath is from time to time blocked where there is a clump, and it is difficult to make it reach below the navel. Yet if they try hard and practise day after day, they will not fail to make their breath reach below the navel. Regarding songs, a good choice is one of the poems in the Man' ydshu (Collection of ten thousand words224) by Taguchi Masuhito2 5 , \"the seashore of Miho of the Kiyomi cape of Ihobara \u2014 that spacious view makes me forget the difficulty of travel, and there is no worry in my mind.\"2 2 6 x x i Pondering the words \"no worry in my mind\" in this verse, they imply that even diseases attributed to one's state of the mind and other symptoms2 2 7 have three causes. First of all, having worries of any kind naturally exhausts and beclouds the mind2 2 8 , and brings various diseases. Therefore I have taught people this poem as a good charm to have, and it has obtained considerable efficacy. The Daoist \"evening 2 2 3 R: shaku ke. C: $^3$? congealed 3#, ^v,) here, means 'habitual inclination' or 'addiction', the same ki. 2 2 4 R: Manydshu. C: AfSlljl Compilation of Ten Thousand Words.

All charms are akin to that poem, and something called Dharanix x lv from India is also identical to verse in terms of rhyme and sound. Therefore in practising this method with a thorough understanding of its intention, it can be left to personal preference and taste which verse or song one chooses. This method was first established for those who sleep uneasily at night due to kan.2 3 1 Later it also came to be employed for such [conditions] as: agony in the heart and throbbing in the chest, abdomen , and below the naval; continuous dizziness and headache due to women's kan2 3 3 ; and the diseases related to women's blood2 3 4 or shaku 2 3 5 that linger on for long years without recovery. Also [when] the suffering produced by illnesses has lasted a long time, or [when] the body2 3 6 is exhausted, and the spirit is depressed. Also [when there is] suffering from stagnated drink2 3 7 against which various medicines have no success, or [when there are] signs of paralysis2 3 8 and symptoms like pain in the abdomen or back that are difficult to cure. When it has been applied to the symptoms above, this method has shown even better efficacy than medicines. It is also sometimes effective for quickening during pregnancy, and for those who have trouble with walking due to the foetus's lying on one side. Even for pregnant women who are free of illnesses, it is of a great benefit for both mother and baby to practise this method every night once the pregnancy is known. Once one 2 2 9 R: bogaju.

In particular I myself have employed this concept for a long time. Depending on the mental ability2 3 9 of each person, I have had efficacy in treating kan2 4 \u00b0, and have even been able to change their characteristics. Such cases have occurred countless times, and it has turned out also to be of great assistance as an adjunct to the use of medicines. There are those who sleep uneasily; or who dream of being attacked in their sleep; or who find it hard to fall asleep every night; or who are alarmed by dreams in which they are about to be killed by someone; or who feel sad because of dreaming of death and funerals; or who dream of being grabbed around the legs; or who are woken by dreams of falling from a great height; or who dream of running away from someone; or who find their bodies covered in sweat when they wake up. These [symptoms] all belong to kan2 4 1 , and if my method of abdominal massage is used assiduously, they will invariably be cured. Once the state of mind2 4 2 has become peaceful, such symptoms will spontaneously cease to occur. Therefore teach and disseminate this method widely among the people, and get rid of the suffering of long years. Although it might sound foolish2 4 3 , it has a very profound significance. Once [the efficacy of] self-massage becomes evident, it often turns out to be far better than using the medicines of ordinary doctors. 2 3 9 R: kikon.

I I The virtue of thrift is a source of much controversy in the Edo yojo texts. Opinions vary depending on the writer's standpoint, such as Confucian asceticism, utilitarianism, or mercantilism. The arguments mainly centre on the critique of luxury and conspicuous consumption in urban life at the time, which is also considered the cause of many lifestyle diseases, such as numb legs (beriberi), food damage, colic, kan mental disorders, shaku , and so on. Furthermore parallels are often drawn between 'being thrifty with money' and 'being thrifty with bodily k i\\ which aided the adoption of yoyo teachings into the social morality instituted by the government. Tsukamoto 1995,289-314. tn This analogy is traced to the famous statement from Litshi chunqiujuan 4 ' jinshu ' , SBCK edition, 151 zhi\\ Sb-iil. ,v The emphasis on being industrious is not only based on the idea o f exercising bodily ki tirelessly; it also seems to fit into the social order established by the Tokugawa regime, in which people were supposed to fulfil their family vocation according to status distinctions. Matsumura 1997,96-117. As for the connection of yojo with work and vocation, Kuriyama points out that there exists an analogy between the circulation of capital in the economy and the circulation of ki in the human body, whereby both the Edo economy and the body, which are seen as organic entities, function efficiently. Kuriyama 1997,44-52. v Prevention is the central theme in Chinese medicine. Huangdi neijing claims that \"the sage does not cure the one who is already ill, but cures the one who is not ill yet\" le A $1, Suwen 'siqidiaoshendalun 14. Later we find: \"a superior physician cures before one falls ill, a middling physician just before, and a lower physician after A (Qianjin yaofang, 5). V 1 evil poison. It is understood as evil qi 3$^, (xieqi ), a technical term indicating the causes of diseases, in contradistinction to right qi \u00b1E ^C (zhengqf): (Suwen 'pingrebinglun 197). As pathogens that invade the human body from without, they are represented in the causative mechanisms of disease such as epidemic ki and the six disturbances A M ( liuyin refers to abnormal climate due to the abnormal state of six qi - wind JE, cold heat H , moisture dryness ^ and fire A ). vii The statement comes from Sunzi ' junxing 5P 7F 0': A A iP H # , (Sunzi. By Sun Wu Commentary by Emperor Wu of the Wei dynasty. Reprint 1985, Zhonghuashuju, Beijing), 5. As far as yojo in the Edo period is concerned, the statement in this form is found in Yojokun, where it is analysed as signifying that if a man defeats desire when it is easy to suppress, illness will never occur {Yojokun, 40). V U I During the Edo period the day was divided into parts: from dawn to sunset (daytime), and from sunset to dawn (night time), and day time and night time were further divided into six-hour periods. Therefore the length of each hour differs according to the season. In summer one hour of night time was shorter than one of daytime, whereas in winter one hour was longer in night time. For example, on the day of the summer solstice, Edo night time ran from 7:00 pm to 5:00 am (10 hours) in today's terms, so one night-time hour was approximately 1 hour and 40 minutes. On the other hand, on the day of winter solstice, Edo night time ran from 5:00 pm to 7:00 am (14 hours), so that one night-time hour was approximately 2 hours and 40 minutes. The time mentioned in the text, \"two or two and a half hours in winter\" can be calculated as \"between 5 hours and 20 minutes or 6 hours and 40 minutes\", and \"four hours in summer\" might be \"6 hours and 40 minutes\" nowadays. I X A commitment to physical activity rather than to mind cultivation is evident here. This contrasts with the Chinese yangsheng tradition. x R: onna no chi no kata no wazurai. C: women's uterine and other diseases, -p /is means the uterus. Diseases of \"chi no kata (blood-related: conventionally, iflO A )\" often represent all kinds of women's diseases including such mental disorders as hysteria or mania. More specifically they refer to the uterine diseases. 273 M This seems to reflect the statement in Qianjin yaofang: PfMUfiU (or An annotation interprets this as \"exhaling is removing old qi, which is also called dead qi ^EM, while inhaling is taking in new qi, which is also called live qi Mo ('yangxing # 1 4 ju a n lT , 'diaoqifa 5), 582. 5 0 1 R: kyofu. C: spasm. Kyoju in Japanese is usually written HIE (fright wind), an infantile disease which is further subdivided into acute MM M and chronic H HIE. In both cases, similar symptoms appear such as convulsive spasms convulsion and stupor. While kan ^ is often equated with spasm, fright wind refers to mental seizures in a broader sense in Byoka suchi (see also Chapter 2, section on kan). It seems that Byoka suchi here associates fright wind with through the common element of loss of mental control. J U U This statement \"upper emptiness and lower fulfilment\"A l# T ^ Kanna (Eisei 2:228-229) from which Hirano Jusei seems to have received influence in developing his own method of abdominal massage and breath regulation. See also the section on hara. X I V The original statement is in Daxue A ^ In Chinese medicine, hue or complexion is supposed to reveal (to those who know how to read it) not only the somatic condition of a person but also that person's mental or moral fibre. For belief in the portents of hue in ancient Chinese culture, including medicine, see Kuriyama Shigehisa 1995, \"Visual knowledge in classical Chinese medicine\", in Bates (ed.), Knowledge and the Scholarly Medical Traditions, 205-234, and Kuriyama 1999, 153-192. X V 1 This part discusses the functional correlations that obtain between universe and human morality in function of the one vital essence that governs both. It seems to contrast with Chinese medical tradition, where the theory of the five phases of circulation and six climatic qi /\\M (wuyun liuqi) serves to explain how climatic conditions and the occurrence of diseases are connected in cosmic correspondences between macrocosm and microcosm. It is noteworthy that Byoka suchi emphasises the correspondence of Heaven with moral virtue, rather than clinical theory. xvn Byomei ikai considers that $Si2iL(abscess) is caused by stagnation of ki and blood (Byomei ikai, 65). Diverse definitions of ^IfiL are found in Chinese medical texts, in which m is always distinguished from \u00a3 |l. For instance, Yuanhoulun defines ^ as a tumour from two to five cun A in size, and defines a tumour bigger than that as J B L . It seems that such differentiation had become rather vague in Edo-period medicine. xvm R: kichigai. C: madness, literally means \"maniac uterus\". Jinkuiyaolue states that women with maniac uterus become joyful, sorrowful, or hurt as if possessed by a demon (697). \"Maniac uterine\" expresses the view that the disease is attributed to the stirring of the uterus (Kanyo byomei taishoroku, 145). More specifically, it is based on the physiology whereby the functions of the mind are governed by the five viscera: the heart stores shen the lungs stores hun fjJ t, the liver stores po 5\u00ae, the spleen stores yi M, the kidney stores zhi M (Suwen 'xuanmingwuqi' 153). Each of these five viscera also stores five qi substances; ying M,xue Jk,qi M, mai f l l j\\,jing The mind actually exists in these five qi substances which circulate along the vessels. Therefore the term WMi implies that there is a disorder of the viscera and qi within, which determines the state of mind and causes mania. X 1 X R: ryuin. C: stagnant drink. In the Edo-period context this was understood as a term for an everyday ailment, referring to indigestion from excessive drinking. Byoka suchi connects several compounds by means of appended phonetic readings: ryuin mochi (habitual blocked drink) - ryuin (stagnated drink) - ryuin (halted drink) = ryuin (lodged drink)= tart (phlegm )\u2014tanke (phlegm). This linkage shows that excessive drink which cannot be digested properly remains within the body, and stagnates as phlegm. \" Iso-iso is a mimetic word which conveys the sense of \"restlessly and eagerly\", while gui-gui is a mimetic term expressing \"vigorously and strongly\". This statement is concerned with how feelings proceed from within. Five Phases theoiy categorises joy as belonging to Earth, which, in terms of the inner organs, also corresponds to the heart, small intestine, and vessels. Likewise anger is classified with Wood, which corresponds to the liver, gallbladder, and sinews. Suwen 274 remarks that if one gets angry, the (yang ) qi of the liver ascends. The liver stores blood and by nature approves of lively flowing and disapproves of depression. So, if one is stirred by an extreme fit of anger, liver qi becomes uncontrollably agitated, and rises up vigorously (i.e. gui-gui ) against the natural flow within the body. On the other hand, when one experiences the emotion of joy, the mind becomes relaxed, because the spirit is harmonised when both yingqi and weiqi flow in a lively way. It suggests that if joy becomes too intense, the mind grows slack and the spirit restless (i.e., iso-iso): (Suwen, ' jutenglun' 221) X X 1 The poem was composed when Taguchi Masuhito was appointed county officer for Kamitsuke iiiFlHW] in708CE.

On not blindly taking medicines 1 (Bydka suchi fascicle 1: page 20-25) When you become ill and send for physicians, what they claim varies from one to another, and they never agree. If moreover the patient and family cannot distinguish who is good or bad, and find it difficult to decide because they are in doubt, it is often far better to put [the treatment] o ff for while and observe the development3 of the illness, rather than take inefficacious medicine. Therefore it is a grave mistake to try to make an expedient decision by such means as divination or consulting an oracle. This is because, if the physicians you have in mind are all unskilled4 and cannot discern the disease5 , and their medicines6 are not appropriate, you will surely end up with one of them by writing their names [on paper] and deciding by divination or oracle. But [whomever you choose] will [still] be one of those unskilled7 physicians. Then if the [physician's] use of medicines shows no efficacy, your doubts will be aroused again, and you will try to change your physician once more. By then the first divination or oracle will have turned out to be useless. So what does this sin of disregarding the gods and Buddha8 1 result in? If you still cannot help but think of deciding by divination or oracle, [instead of that] just make a list of many physicians with a good reputation - those who have insight - and concentrate on treatment. Even if the [physician] you select does not 1 R: mochiubekarazaru kokoroe o toku. blindly miawase. C: iHE tidings. 3 R: toriyuki. $ 1 spiritual illumination, or something like divine wisdom. I translate kami # as gods, plural, because it usually refers to a number of Shinto gods, who are often referred to as the \"eight million\" (i.e. countless gods). 276 satisfy your own mind9, you must not harbour the slightest doubt. Set your mind on that person, entrust [him] with the life and death of the patient, and trust Heaven's decree. If you do so, there will be a response from the gods and Buddha1 0 . But people who are decisive in this way do not need to use divination or oracles. You should know that divination or oracles are of no use anyway. It is all the more so with regard to the progress of disease. If you do not know any physicians who have mastered their art, nothing could be better than to wait for progress1 1 without using any medicines for a while, rather than making mistakes in treatment because one has been misled by the conflicting opinions of unskilled physicians1 2 1 1 . This is what the ancients called \"getting a middle/middling physician1 3 \"1 when they do not use medicine for diseases\". \"Middling physician\" means a mediocre physician. It is said that superior physicians1 4 can cure diseases that have not yet developed [into symptoms] and then can prevent those diseases from appearing, while \"middling physicians\"1 5 are those who make no mistake in using medicine in time of disease and invariably achieve efficacy. Therefore we should know that even middling physicians are by no means just the same as ordinary ones. This is a word of warning against the blind use of medicine, which is harmful. It teaches that all the diseases of humankind are to be attributed to the order of Heaven, so you should let an illness run its course in accordance with nature rather than apply a treatment that is against reason. Although it is difficult for laypersons to be convinced, listen to the summary of reasons given here. 9 R: kokoro . C: M intention. 1 0 and Buddha. 1 artisan. 1 3 R: chui.

Physicians use medicines2 0 , acupuncture, and moxibustion simply in order to make up for lack of force, and to prevent vital energy2 1 from being defeated by diseases22. When vital energy2 3 is more than sufficient2 4 '' to expel the disease , the disease should heal naturally without needing to rely upon the power of moxibustion and medicines. However, the circulation2 6 of ki and blood2 7 will gradually reach its limits; therefore acute diseases can be cured speedily, but efficacy does not appear for chronic diseases unless they are treated patiently . All diseases have certain periodic sequences measured in days. This is not only the case with smallpox3 1 or measles3 2 , where the signs are easily noticeable; it also applies to cold damage, intermittent fever3 3 and diarrhoea3 4 A 1 1 these diseases have their periodic sequences.

Look at a thorn stuck in the flesh. Several days must pass for the function of nature3 7 to form pus and get rid of the thorn. Also suppose that you suddenly catch a slight cold from falling into a doze with your head resting on your elbow. Even if the time it took was shorter than the time it takes to have one or two smokes, once the o npores of the skin become affected by cold air, [the cold] will not go away unless you OQperspire satisfactorily all over your body. Think that it takes time. This is even more so with respect to diseases that are not trivial, such as when you shiver4 0 as though splashed with water, seem to bum up with fever41, find that foods taste strange, or do not feel at ease in [your] daily behaviour. How on earth can there be any reason for such illnesses to be cured soon? Similarly there are cases such as syphilis4 2 that has gradually developed from ulcers on the genitalia4 3 , or venereal scabies4 4 that has spread from the palm to the whole body, or shaku4 5 which has remained congealed4 6 within the abdomen4 7 for years, and all other diseases which have accumulated for months and years.

It is assumed that many people suffer from stiff legs as an after-effect of stroke. 279 appear to occur all of a sudden. But there are always damaged parts within the abdomen5 0 , and paralysis and stroke arise5 1 from interaction with these damaged parts. Therefore even if they appear acute, they cannot be cured immediately. People in the world, not knowing this principle, believe the words of drug sellers or physicians5 2 , and are pleased to hear them say they will cure diseases within the short space of one or two weeks. [Also] there are people who use the medicines of physicians who string together flowery words5 3 and only care about making an outward show5 4 , and end up wasting the time [needed] for healing. There are also people who believe the words of a shrine maiden or a shaman, or who think that the \"silent pulse\"5 5 v i is real, and become pleased with nonsensical things like miracle drugs and famous moxibustion treatments. Then there are people who choose physicians according to [the lore of] the directions; and people who carry out partial treatments relying on diagnosis from an amateur's shallow knowledge5 6 . Acting like this, they will damage the legacy5 7 of their parents, which cannot be regained ever again. How could one not know that this is a huge mistake? Even though medicines are intended to cure diseases, they should not be used blindly without distinguishing if they are appropriate or inappropriate. Laypersons are blind to this principle, and expect medicines to lengthen even a life that is doomed to extinction. Yet apart from cereals, meat, fruits and vegetables, which are eaten constantly, everything is unbalanced or poisonous, as long as it is considered a medicine to cure diseases. Therefore just as medicines show efficacy when they are 5 0 R: hara no uchi. 1 * 3 internal organs. 5 1 R: moyo' oshi aute okoru. gradually invoke. 5 2 R: i s h a . -f& IS : quack. 5 3 R: iimawashi yoku. to play with words. 5 4 R: kidori moppara.

It is the warning of an ancient sage that you should not try medicines blindly.v n \u00a3QLook at the actions of physicians in the world. When you say you have a headache, they prescribe and give medicines from the chapters on headache in textbooks5 9 . However this same headache may stem from cold damage6 0 or cold6 1 , periods6 diseases related to women's blood6 7 , stagnated drink6 8 , or seasickness7 0 [motion sickness], bruising, the initial fever of smallpox7 1 and measles . Each cause of disease is different. Therefore medicines are intended to cure those causes of diseases. For headache is merely a derivative symptom7 3 ; it does not mean that there are particular medicines for headache. Due to being unable to recognise the cause of a disease correctly, physicians first prescribe medicines from the chapter on headache. It is as if they were to express condolences to someone who weeps when moved by watching a play. If you mention dizziness, [the physicians] add the ingredient for dizziness; and if you complain of back pain, they add a few more ingredients, saying that they are adjusting for back pain. They prescribe only by reference to symptoms, so that when there are various symptoms, one prescription 5 8 R: isha. C: S IX slovenly artisan. 5 9 R: U text of skills. 6 0 shokan.

C: MW? measles. 281 sometimes consists of more than twenty ingredients. What a laughable thing. Trying to hide such poor skills, from their youth they learn oratory just to deflect people's attention. Then without realising it, even clever people, being blinded by their smooth tongues7 4 and [such] worldly-wise speech, will eventually fall into their trap and end up courting trouble. Even without knowing for certain the cause of diseases, [these physicians] mention baseless terms like phlegm accumulation75, blood accumulation76, wind 7 7 7 0consumption , or blood consumption . They regard all women's diseases as blood-related7 9 or due to impure blood80; they call all children's diseases worms8 1 or infant colic8 2 . They account for unknown diseases by stagnated drink8 3 or attribute them to the rise of liver fire8 4 , the moist heat of the liver vessel8 5 , or the appearance of fatigue in the past, damage to the mind, or the action of phlegm. As these explanations are all stock phrases used by physicians in the world, they are words to 0 7please laypersons . Physicians think that people would not understand even if they were told the truth.

If you are also aware of this, you should know that there is no reason for the prescribed medicines to have any efficacy, and that healing is the operation8 9 of innate nature90. Unless you comprehend this point, you may be cheated by physicians in the world9 1 , and commit an unforeseen sin against loyalty or filial piety in case of your lord's or your parents' illness. This is what dutiful children and loyal vassals must know first and foremost. Herein lies the teaching of the ancients that those who serve their parents should not be ignorant of medicine1 . If you understand this point, you will know that the constant use of medicines, such as [taking] what people call cultivating-life tonicslx even when one is free of illness, is just like being armed with a halberd and shield in a peaceful world or carrying an umbrella and wearing rain shoes on a sunny day. You should know that there will be much loss but no benefit at all. Likewise do not use acupuncture and moxibustion unless you have a disease. Moreover for those children who can hardly bear the heat of fire, and have no disease to be treated, methods like moxibustion for cultivating lifex are the worst practice of all. Whatever skills [physicians] have, how could there be any reason for moxibustion or medicines to extend one's fixed lifespan92? Therefore you should know that medicines that [purport to] lengthen Q1 !lifespan or increase vital essence are all the tricks of idle folk who encourage others' lewdness and greed, and are not to be used by the man with aspirations. The people who truly know the order of Heaven are those who, having clearly understood this 8 8 R: toza maniai. C: excuse. 0 R: ten ' nen shizen.

C: cunning flatterer. 283 principle, leave life in the hands of Heaven, and trust the treatment of physicians without entertaining the slightest doubt. If you are confused by the eloquence of low physicians9 4 or by the conflicting criticisms9 5 of amateurs, it is just like taking orders from those who know nothing about navigating a ship. As soon as the ship gets into trouble from the wind and waves, it cannot avoid capsizing. Thus aboard a ship, you should not take need of anything but the words of those who are accustomed to the weather and sea routes. If you do not realise that this is also the case in medicine, what a foolish thing that is. I Although many scholars construe the term ( shenming in Chinese) as a reference to a certain kind of mental state, its interpretation still remains debatable. is originally associated with religion, indicating a kind of magical efficacy wrought by external spirits. Later the term also became endowed with a physiological connotation, referring to divine powers in nature and to human intelligence. On early references to shenming in Chinese tradition, see Harper (1998), 120-121, John Knoblock 1988, Xunzi: a translation and study of the complete works , vol.l (Stanford University Press, Stanford), 252-255, As far as Bydka suchi is concerned, furigana kami-hotoke is conventionally written (gods and Buddha). In this context, in Bydka suchi seems to suggest a numinous cure by the agency of the gods or Buddha. I I According to Shirasugi (2001), the term fljfE first appeared in Song China. It was first used to indicate \"ordinary physicians\" as the literal meaning of the individual characters suggests, often in contrast with the medical sage (HA or EH). However by the Qing dynasty, J jffE had become synonymous with \"unskilled J t fl, so that it seems to reflect views in contemporary China. m Chinese tradition classifies physicians into three ranks; superior, middling, and lower. The ideal model of the superior physician was first referred to as a sage HA or good physician J^E, as in Suwen: The sage does not cure the disease that has already occurred, but cures the disease that has not occurred yet H A 'F fp 'siqidiaoshendalun E M fW A fraJiP, 14. On the other hand, Lingshu classifies physicians into three ranks, but relates these to an appraisal of acupuncture technique: [In the practice of acupuncture] the superior artisan calms qi, the middling artisan disturbs vessels, and the lower artisan cuts qi off, and endangers life 4 1 T-iSL^u T A (genjie 137). Lingshu claims that there are three approaches to diagnosis: se (hue &), mai (palpation J H c )> and chi (ulnar skin R ), and that the superior physicians who use all three can cure 90 % of cases, while the middle physicians who use two can cure 70 % , and the low physicians who use only one can cure 60 % ( Lingshu 'xueqizangfubingxing 93). Later, Qianjin yaofang states that \"a superior physician diagnoses from a patient's voice, a middling physician from a patient's hue, and a lower physician from a patient's pulse A E ^ t^ -, 4 1 E I^ ^ U (Qianjin yaofang, 5). Mayanagi observes that expressions for the ideal physician gradually change from antiquity to the time of Jinkui yaoliie, from \"sage\" to \"good physician\", and finally to \"superior physician\". Accordingly the image of the physician was first 9 4 R: heta isha. C: MfH objection. 284 associated with the image of the virtuous sage. In particular, the skill of diagnosing from a patient's complexion often overlaps with the numinous power of the sage. Yet as the methods of diagnosis were established, particularly when palpation and acupuncture became central to medicine, good physicians required not (only) to possess moral fibre but to have mastered these techniques. Mayanagi Makoto, 'Isha no rank (chugoku hen)', available at: http://mayanagi.hum.ibaraki.ac.jp/paper04/Secom01.htm. Regarding the popular view of physicians during the Edo period, Shirasugi (2001) examines the standards of physicians and their level of technique and learning. Quacks were often called yabu isha (/UllE, f& H E , or in contrast to \"good physicians BlUi\". In fact there were only a few good physicians, and the vast majority of people had no alternative but to consult unskilled ones. Shirasugi 2001,95-113. I v The belief in \"the functional power of nature \u00a7 of the body is representative of the vision of disease and healing in Bydka suchi. As synonyms, Bydka suchi from time to time terms \" umaretsukitaru karada no kaneai /fe fb'O cf tc (innate function of the body), ten ' nen no hatarah # (innate function), karada no ten ' nen no hataraki (function of the nature of body), shizen no hataraki [tj cF (function of nature), ten ' nen shizen ii (innate nature), and genki shizen no hataraki (power of vital essence and nature). The idea of \"puiging\" pathogenic evil differentiates itself from the methods of traditional medicine in Japan, which is in principle based on the concept of \"restoring balance\" within the body. As for the role of \"the functional power of nature\", Bydka suchi explains, for instance, that fever is one of its manifestations, in that it serves to remove excessive heat from the body thereby restoring the balance with the outer air. Such phenomena as diarrhoea and pus are also attributed to the work of \"the functional power of nature\" as it tries to purge pathogenic evil poisons from the body. In this view, treatment should primarily aim at drawing on the natural healing power that comes from within the patient, and medicines, acupuncture and moxibustion are all fundamentally supplementary. Terminology such as il is rather unfamiliar in traditional medicine, and it seems almost certain that Bydka suchi received a certain influence from trends in contemporary Western medicine concerning ideas of healing by nature. The idea of the healing power of nature can be traced in Western medical tradition since Hippocrates. In particular, in the eighteenth century it was espoused by the Leiden school, based in Holland, several texts of which were translated by Edo physicians. Moreover the term \"healing power of nature\" can be found in some Edo medical texts in connection with Western medicine. It seems that Hirano's idea o f a natural healing power originates in contemporary Western medicine, particularly that of the Leiden school, in view of the association of fever and pus. It is known to us that several medical texts of the Leiden schools were translated by Edo physicians. For instance, the two texts Manbyo chijun pf are known to have introduced the medicine of the Leiden school to Edo society. Swieten, a pupil of Boerhaave, wrote a commentary and notes on the \"Aphorisms\" (1709) of Boerhaave, and Manbyo chijun is a translation of Swieten's work. Taisei netsubyoron is the translation of a work by Huxham, also a pupil of Boerhaave (1771). It is a good example of the thinking of the Leiden school on the healing power of nature (introduced to Japan as shizen ryono ll ) . In addition, the idea of this natural healing power is also found in several medical texts of the 1820s. For instance, there are Seiyo iji benwaku It can be assumed that Hirano was introduced to the idea of healing power of nature by these medical texts. The influences of Boerhaave's medicine were examined at the International Historical Conference: 150th Anniversary of the Beginning of Modem Westem-style Medical Education in Japan, \"Hirano Jusei, the Author of \"Byoka suchi\" (1832) and His Natural Healing Power\" by Hirao, Machiko and Keiko Daidoji, November, 2007. Nonetheless, there seems to have been a certain difference in treatment between Bydka suchi and the Western natural therapists. In the West, the idea of the healing power of nature can be traced back to Hippocrates's expectant therapy, which came into favour once again in the eighteenth century. On the other hand the emphasis on the healing power of nature in Bydka suchi is intertwined with objections to the blind use of medicines and to amateur diagnosis, which can easily go wrong. The influence of 285 shizen ryono \u00a7 on the Dutch School under the Edo is studied by Yoshida Tadashi 1999 (unpublished, outline available at: http://ja-tec.eom/I/I04/contentl3348.html). v The term (surfeit youyu in Chinese) appears to reflect the most fundamental principle of treatment in the Chinese medical tradition; that is, surfeit and depletion. In the famous statement of Laozi, \"to reduce what is excessive, and to supplement insufficiency {sun youyu bu buzu)\" is the Way of dedaojing, chapter 77,1055-182). In the medical cdntext, surfeit and deficiency (T'S buzu in Chinese) are often replaced by the discourse of fullness ^ {shi) and depletion jfe {xu) with reference to imbalance within the body. Medicine associates yin with depletion, and yang with fullness. In the human body, fullness generally signifies the state in which qi satisfactorily fills the five viscera, while depletion indicates a weakened and depleted state, which is vulnerable to invasion by outer evil ^ 3 $ from outside the body. Fullness also enters into the model of the pathology of evil qi, which affects the depleted body externally in the form of wind JH or cold for example. Although \"fullness\" always conjures up \"depletion\" as its correlative concept, in Chinese tradition depletion is regarded as the more fundamental state of the human body. Moreover it is noteworthy that Chinese yangsheng is permeated by a great fear of qi emptiness or loss. References to fullness typically occur in tandem with the problem of depletion, but depletion usually represents the more fundamental concern. Depletion as a pathology indicates a morbid diminution, as is expressed in such disease names as kidney depletion Wife, depleted exhaustion jfe^j, spleen depletion j$-jfe. All these are attributed to the depletion of particular parts of the body. Yamada (1999) points out what he calls \"depletion-phobia\" in Chinese medical tradition, and attributes the particular enthusiasm for replenishing tonics and dietetics, aimed at replenishing bodily qi by food and drink, to this fear of depletion. In Edo medical discourse, in contrast, it seems that this preoccupation with depletion is replaced by the fear of stagnation. On the fear of stagnation in Edo-period medicine, see Chapter 2, section on Konare. Kuriyama 1999, 1:105-24. V i What refers to is unknown. Some suggest that it may be synonymous with 'FFnj# (No-question diagnosis), which determines the symptom by means of the other three diagnoses (listening, seeing and touching), dispensing with the need for questioning diagnosis Pp^ # . Here it may indicate making a diagnosis by palpation only. I am grateful to the members of the Japanese Association of Nursing History for this interpretation. seems to reflect the statement in Yijing Even when one happens to have a violent illness, if one does not take medicine, there will be the pleasure (of healing naturally). (Since you have already been reckless), do not try reckless medicines ^ 0: T^hjf^-tti). Zhouyi M M 95,Juan 3 'wuwang 2$^' (SSJZS edition),40. vm This statement probably originates with a Chinese Confucian, Zhu Xi of Song China: Those who serve their parents must know medicine ( ^ ^ # 2 / ^ t\u00a7 E ) by Zhu Xi in Ydjd kusuri (cultivating-life medicine) can be defined as a tonic that strengthens the body and prevents illnesses when taken regularly. Such medicines became very popular during the Edo period, promoted by massive growth in the patent medicine market. x Ydjd kyii (moxibustion for cultivating life). Moxibustion treatment was originally paired with acupuncture; usually moxibustion is done on the back while acupuncture is done on the abdomen. However Edo-period people often used moxibustion alone on the loci of the back, arms and legs as preventive medicine or a way to preserve good health. 286 3-4. What to remember in choosing a physician1 {Bydka suchi fascicle 1: page 25-31) The ancients said that in order to serve your parents, you must know about medicine1 . This does not mean, however, that you should learn medicine yourself. It means that you need to know beforehand who is good or bad among well-known physicians in the world, and when you send for a physician at the time of a parent's illness, no mistake should be made. The art of medicine is such an important responsibility because it concerns people's lives. Hence even for a very clever man, no matter how hard he studies to master the way [of medicine] and how many patients he attends, and how much he concentrates his mind on treatment, there are still things that can be achieved and things that cannot be achieved. It is most difficult to reach the state of excellence. * TNotice that Confucius did not take the medicine that Ji Kangzi sent to him, saying: \"My skill [in medicine] has not yet reached high enough\"1 1 . This is more likely to happen to ordinary people, if they learn medicine just to serve their parents. Some people are pleased4 with the medical theories that they have seen and heard; they rely on their own judgement5 and just try to do what is written6. They even prescribe medicines of no efficacy , which they measure out by themselves and offer to their ill parents. If there has been no harm yet, it is merely thanks to a stroke of luck8 , and when you reflect on this well, it is in all seriousness a fearful thing9. We can hardly call this 1 R: I oerabu beki kokoroe o toku. C: t < , Discuss what to remember in choosing a physician. 2 R: kokoro. C: M intention. 3 R: Ki Kdshi.

It is harmful that Confucian scholars who are ignorant of the [underlying] reasons1 0 misunderstand these words1 1 . Now it seems hard for laypersons to tell good physicians from bad. But just do not allow self-centred judgement1 2 to enter your mind1 3 , and get rid of any thought of favourable prejudice. Consider deeply the illness from its outset to even before its occurrence, and cross-examine1 4 what the physicians are saying. Discern whether the physician's words glitter with a silvery veneer of flattery1 5 but are without sincerity, or whether they are full of truthfulness, showing that the physician is earnest about treatment. What a serious physician says may differ a great deal from the understanding1 6 of an a layperson, and is often not pleasing to hear. People who are 17 ij)pleased by affectation and expect flattery just give credence to plausible but misleading1 9 medical ideas2 0 that agree with their own statements. This is where errors start. Furthermore, even those physicians who are praised as skilled, and have dealt with2 1 thousands of serious illnesses from their youth to old age, make diagnoses that do not turn out to be right every time. Therefore amateurs, those who do not even 77know how diseases occur, have no means of understanding the true principle of whatever [illness] it may be, even with respect to mild symptoms like cold or food damage. When they happen to hear correct statements, they would rather doubt them 1 0 R: s u j i m i c h i .

As for those physicians who are clever and able to make correct decisions2 4 and commit no errors in dealing with things, it is reasonable to trust that they are even capable of governing the nation. Unless those who are deeply knowledgeable about the principles of things [also] possess a benevolent stance and make good decisions2 5 , it is hard to reach that state [of excellence] 2 6 Therefore it is no wonder that there is not such a person in the world. Considering the difficulty of discerning the inside2 7 by means of the outside2 8 , and of determining the location of the disease in order to prescribe medicine, you should neither avoid nor reject the words of trustworthy physicians who consistently show efficacy just because they sometimes make minor mistakes. Suppose there are those [physicians] who are caught up in worldly affairs2 9 and do not devote themselves3 0 to the treatment [of their patients]. Compare them with ' l lthose physicians who are solely concerned with medical practice and too conscientious3 2 to be pretentious33; their mistakes are visible even to the eyes of amateurs. In order to distinguish which physicians are good and which are bad3 4 , forget about any intuition3 5 in your abdomen36, and do not be led astray by the embellishments3 7 and flowery verbiage3 8 of popular practitioners3 9\"1 If you do so, 2 consideration. 2 4 area. 2 7 R: inner body. 2 8 R: hoka.

Remember that a good leader in olden times could know the minds of tens of thousands of heroes from a single word, and entrust them with important responsibilities, and use them as if they were his own limbs. Compared to that, how can it be difficult to judge and know the inner mind of a man of little calibre4 0 who is satisfied with life 0ust] because of having medicine as his occupation? However, nowadays when feudal lords become ill, they err in their choice of physician and make more mistakes than lowly people, and seldom get medicines4 1 that turn out to be effective. This is because they are blinded by the florid manner4 2 and pleasant speech4 3 of the popular physician4 4 who holds sway. Also they just follow what is said by their entourage [who in turn repeat] the same opinions4 5 as the cliques of physicians46. [Thus these lords] accept a [diagnosis] without inquiring if it is appropriate or not47. Even if there happens to be a physician who knows its falseness, he will be excluded by the clique48. He has no way to make known what he thinks4 9 , so he remains silent and eventually it becomes impossible to perform even normal5 0 treatment. [This is why] people assume that if noble persons develop a serious illness5 1 , they will invariably die. Is it not the most lamentable custom? 3 9 R: hayari isha.

If he is deeply worried about a parent's illness, there is nothing of which to be ashamed in personally meeting and dismissing the physician, as a man called Yan Zhitui5 3 has taughtlv . For the physician who is entrusted with the precious life of a lord or his parents, the responsibility is heavier than that of a general who is in command5 4 in times of emergency5 5 . The office of the physician is a serious matter that concerns the nation and the family, so it is not the behaviour of the man of benevolence to look down on it. However a young lord5 6 just leaves the responsibility5 7 to his retainers and does not concern himself about it all, and those retainers leave it to the physicians, and those physicians leave it to other physicians with a popular name.5 8 They are all trying to escape from being blamed later by each other. What could be less filial, loyal and just? If one's lord or father is surrounded by enemies or is in trouble in single combat, one who possesses the spirit of filial piety and loyalty cannot help but sacrifice himself and dash to the rescue. Now if you were to find your lord or father in great trouble5 9 , having been cornered by the formidable enemy of illness, and you just looked on as if it were none of your business without feeling ashamed, it would be the behaviour of a beast. If you had seen such fellows of no filial piety or loyalty in the age of the warring 5 2 R: kiki tadashi. C: MUr to take care of. 5 3 R: Gan Shisui. C. Yan Zhitui in Chinese. 5 4 R: so g r n b a i .

C: vain name. 5 9 R: dainan. C: disaster. 291 states6 0, you would never have forgiven them even if they were on your side. First of all condemn that sin, and then punish other [sins]. And yet how can these men just neglect their obligations through the generations out of fear of losing remuneration6 1 ? Also with regard to people like those physicians who are concerned only with currying favour with the family of the patient, and with exalting their fame by garnering compliments, there should be no reason for them to be useful in case of emergency. Such persons never prescribe strong medicines62, even when it is necessary in case of serious symptoms. They just deceive people by their eloquent verbiage. If the patient complains that the medicine is bitter, they change the prescription; and if they hear that the medicine is too unpalatable, they simply adjust it. This is their ostensible kindness expressed in glib speech.v Even if they look like good people6 3 on the surface, their inner heart is just as dirty as silk cloths [used] for wrapping dung. Even with those physicians who are said to be skilled in the art of medicine, when their minds are moved to aspire to success6 4 and to ingratiate themselves with the authorities, their skill will deteriorate. It is also obvious that those physicians who give themselves up to indulgence in the tea ceremony, waka poetry, collaborative poetryV l, football and other [arts or pastimes]6 5 lose their grasp of6 6 medical skills. Needless to say, those who indulge in alcohol and sex, or pursue profit by selling drugs along with the practice of medicine, or have exaggerated respect for rich merchants, are plainly of poor ability. Medicine is a lowly skill6 7 , but it is an 6 0 R: ransei. C: warring states. In Japan it indicates the turbulent age from 1467 to the end of the sixteenth century. 6 1 R: chigyo.

Even with regard to people like millionaires or feudal lords, if a physician does not care about their rudeness and like a slave becomes glad of having access to their houses, is it not thoughtless to entrust such a practitioner with a patient in danger7 0 ? This echoes the proverb that \"scholarly physicians are not good at medical skills\" 1 . Medical skill cannot reach proficiency7 1 through devotion to study7 2 alone without experiencing the good results of treatment7 3 . It is just the same as a rice merchant who judges7 4 the rice of a growing area or district at a glance, or a banker who distinguishes good gold and silver from bad7 5 by picking it up, or the fabric dealer who can tell without a mistake the provenance of woven silk by touch. They all rely not on book-learning or the secret transmission of oral learning7 6 , but on the achievements7 7 of long years. This too is the case with medicine. Those who talk of theories from book-learning and have little experiential knowledge7 8 often make misjudgements because of the harm wrought by the books they have read. This is even more the case with people who are dedicated to Confucian or Buddhist texts, or who regard theories such as yunqi \" and the Five Phases as the main idea of medicine. How can they manage to provide treatment? Moreover the medicine of Holland has become very popular recently. Yet there are physicians who adulate 6 8 R: inochi. C: A 'ft human life. 6 9 R: kuro.

[Dutch medicine] without recognising the difference of that land7 9 from our own. Pleased with the eccentric novelty of their theories, and blinded by their ingeniousness, some physicians merely read the translated texts of the Dutch physicians' perfunctorily80. Just like a dog barking at its shadow*, they are not going to investigate those theories thoroughly. Without entertaining any doubts as to whether it is good or bad8 1 , they are under the misapprehension that there can be no mistake8 2 in all that the Dutch say, and they often recite it. Then many laypersons also listen to those theories because of their novelty value and leave patients to such physicians to be used as guinea pigs for Dutch medicine. In the end many people are harmed. If someone encounters it with their eyes wide open 8 4 , Western learning can sometimes be utilised. But nowadays it only causes unnecessary harm and little benefit, because people fall into bias and do not investigate the other [side of Western learning]. As the ancients said, there are few men in the world who realise the harmfulness of something despite loving it.*1 What is more, people do not know that the investigation8 5 of the forty-one chemical elements*1 1 , which forms the basis of Western learning, may have many problematic aspects. Also as to theories such as \"nothingness cannot be being, and being cannot be nothingness\"* 1 1 1 , they are such an evil8 6 thing and greatly harmful. Although I would now like to lecture on the falseness of these [ideas], this would not only be useless to lay people, but also, for the most part, hard to understand, so I will not talk tediously of unrelated things. Just as it is natural for human nature to favour 7 9 R: tochi. C: jElrh natural features. 1 R: false. 8 remark. 8 3 R: tenarai 8 4 R: me no akitaru mono. C: clever and knowledgeable people. C: prying. 8 6 R: yokoshima. C: an evil course. 294 anything novel, it is most lamentable that people in the world all8 7 end up advocating [novelty] without deep consideration. As I mentioned before, it is problematic to entrust [physicians] with serious illnesses, unless their words and deeds match, and their intention lies in truth8 8 and benevolence. , As far as the household of a sick person is concerned, the family should invite a physician respectfully. They should not allow private opinion8 9 to intrude in the slightest, should not insist on anything at all90 , should not bother with such foolishness as oracles or fortunes related to direction or date, and should meet the physician with sincerity. Otherwise it will be difficult to consult a good physician. The art of medicine is the hardest to carry out. Even though I am anxious and desirous that there should be fewer mistakes, it is still difficult to achieve that situation. Moreover few physicians in the world know how hard it is, and that is one of the shortcomings9 1 of peaceful times like [ours]. I lament this so much that despite criticism9 2 from others, I have written down an outline [of my ideas], so as to offer it as something for people in the world to remember, as well as an admonition to myself.

He emphasised family-centred morality and study, as well as ways to get on in the world.

Reprint 1993 (annotated 122-123. v Byoka suchi refers repeatedly to the harm caused by the blind use of medicines not only by lay people but also by unskilled physicians. For instance, Ydjond (by Ogawa Kendo /J\\J I IMilt, 1773) also blames unskilled physicians /If H E for blindly using medicines just in order to please patients, quoting the old saying \"it is possible to cure the person who is damaged by illness, while it is most difficult to cure the person who is damaged by medicines (l^#5$i IPI#\u00a7|y$\u00a3|iE)\" (Eisei 1:32).

V 1 \" \"Gakui wasajiga mawaranu (scholarly physicians cannot deal with a drug spoon)\" was a well-known proverb in the Edo period, although its origin is unknown. It mocks overly academic physicians, and emphasises the primaiy importance of clinical experience. To judge from the substantial number of references to classic texts both in Chinese and Japanese in his work, Hirano Jusei had by no means neglected the benefits of book learning. However, it is clinical experience and sincerity that Byoka suchi prizes most in the making of a good physician. This perhaps draws a contrast with, for instance, Yojokun , which still asserts the primary necessity of book learning: \"People who wish to become physicians should firstly read Confucian texts and master scholarly learning ( Yojokun, 125)\" and \"Japanese physicians can be no match for Chinese physicians, because their application to study is no match for that of the Chinese (Yojokun, 130)\", K R: unki gogyo.

Under die Song dynasty this theory underwent innovation as the system of the five circulatory phases and the six influences (wuyun liuqi 3 lE /n %), and permeated every aspect of medicine. See Unschuld 1985,170-172; Catherine Despeux 2001 'The system of the five circulatory phases and the six seasonal influences'; Hsu, 121-165.

Miura's philosophy is systematically developed based on the theory of ki and yin yang. He is said to have been much influenced by the ancient Chinese classic Zhouyi jiljI (The Book o f Changes, anonymous, date unknown, 7th century BCE?) and Western astronomy. The argument in Gengo is based on logic but is extremely complex, because it was developed using original technical terms invented by Miura himself (Saigusa Hiroto 1941, Miura Baien no well as a philosopher, Miura Baien was a physician who pursued the medicine of the Classic School, particularly advocating Shanghanlun (Hattori Toshiro 97-108). Miura is said seldom to have moved from his hometown, and his ideas were not accepted by most contemporary thinkers due to their extraordinary uniqueness. After Miura's death, his pupils tried to publish his works, but without success. It is just possible that Hirano might have come across the ideas of Miura via oral communications, and is displaying this knowledge to his critics in Bydka suchi. 297 3-5. Discussion of what to bear in mind when you see a physician1 {Bydka suchi fascicle 1: page 31-34) When you tell the symptoms of [your] illness to a physician, you should describe them from starting from the onset, without any omission. First you should tell him in detail if you eat a lot or a little, if you sleep well or badly, whether or not you have regular bowel movements, what medication you have taken so far, and if you have any habitual diseases2, and then ask for treatment. >If the disease turns out to be chronic , you are likely to forget what occurred earlier on, so think hard so as to remember. If you have suffered from such [conditions] as venereal scabies4, , beriberi1 2 , or bruises or cut, you should consider this in detail1 3 , and talk about all these matters. Even if there are things that should be kept secret, it will be very harmful to hide anything concerning [your] illness. This thing or that could provide a clue1 4 for the physician in seeking the cause of the disease. As mentioned before, it does no good to construct a diagnosis according to [your] personal bias1 5 and begin by telling that to the physician. Physicians who desire 1 R: Ini aitai suru 1 3 R: and small. 1 4 1 5 R: higa kokoro. C: selfishness. 298 flattery1 6 are unable to search for the true cause of illness if they are drawn in by your 1 *7words, and will first try to probe into the patient's mind. If that is the case, you will listen to such a physician's opinion and not notice at all that it is a sham1 8 intended to flatter you. You will feel gratified by the delusion that [his] opinion matches your way of thinking, and you will eventually fall into the snare of that physician. You must remember this. Trying to test a physician's skill, some patients who have a jaundiced1 9 and distorted mentality do not give the details of [their] symptoms to enable the physician to diagnose them, and want [instead] to listen to what the physician will say2 0 . This is a huge misunderstanding. Physicians recognise an inner2 1 disease from the outside2 2 by palpating the pulse, discerning the colour (complexion)1 and pressing the abdomen1 1 . It is a difficult art to perform if they are careless. As to serious disease, even when a physician is committed to his art2 3 , you cannot possibly say that there will never be any omission, unless various symptoms2 4 are closely examined. This is even more the case with unskilled physicians25. You should be afraid that mistakes may occur unless you give a full account, with abundant detail. If you hold back and do not speak out, it is as though you were to treat your own precious body as a toy. As far as a similar bowel movement is concerned, there is a considerable2 6 difference according to the colour and odour. Also regarding constipation, some 1 6 R: kobi o C: want for sale. 1 1 inside the body. 2 hoka. C: outer surface. 2 3 Heaven and Earth. 299 constipation is due to dryness from heat27, while other cases are due to lack of moisture2 8 \"1 , due to a clump from colic and shaku2 9 , or due to a paralysed spot within the abdomen30. Therefore you should not just use purgative medicine by itself. This is also true of urine retention. Nonetheless, when it comes to ordinary physicians3 3 , some of these fellows regard [the variations] as all the same. In particular, there are people who suffer from asthma, coughing, or spastic pain in the chest and ribs because of an obstruction in the pathway of the skin pores3 4 lv ; [there are also] people who suffer from urine retention, and women who suffer from clumps3 5 in the lower abdomen3 6. They appear to be suffering from oedema3 7 localised in the abdomen3 8 and the uterus, and we sometimes find that treatments for oedema happen to be effective. However the urination of these patients invariably differs from what is usual. Unless patients attentively3 9 consider it themselves, it is impossible [to ensure] that there is no oversight4 0 in the physician's diagnosis. Apart from [these patients], there are people who have trouble in the abdomen4 1 due to urine retention, and not oedema42. Needless to say patients make mistakes, but even physicians sometimes do not realise this and make mistakes in treatment. Thus laypersons should also bear this in mind very 2 7 R: netsu.

In addition, many women are ashamed of speaking about genital diseases43. If so, the woman's mother, husband, or maid should report to the physician privately. Nonetheless you should know that this cannot be preferable to her explaining'it herself. It is also not good at all to make a wet-nurse look after ill children, as this is a source of error. From breast milk and food to urination and defecation, a mother should inspect these and tell the physician herself. Especially with those children who cry at the sight of a physician, it is difficult to examine their abdomen4 4 properly, so that there will be a great loss unless [their mother] describes the symptoms in detail and asks for treatment. However good the physician may be, he is in sole charge of many patients and busy bustling about here and there. It is impossible that there should never be any mistakes in the physician's listening and observation during a brief meeting. Therefore it is crucial to understand4 5 [this] well and talk. Those who wish to worship gods and offer mercy to the lowly [or the young]4 6 should be especially careful about this [how to talk to the physician]47. Also, it may sometimes impede treatment4 8 if one complains hastily when one finds that medicines taste foul. Is it not said that good medicines taste bitter but benefit [cure] illness?v Nonetheless if the patient feels stagnation4 9 in the chest5 0 or feels like vomiting every time they are made to take medicines, or if they feel out of sorts in any way after taking medicines5 1 and find that [those medicines] cause stagnation5 2 it sometimes 4 R: hara o miru.

In that case, it is not good [for the nursing attendant] to force the patient to take them. As hanm might be caused, you should immediately notify the physician, who may alter the medication. However, appropriate medicines sometimes show rapid efficacy after making one feel dizzyvl, so one should appreciate that this cannot be discussed easily. Also all medicines should be taken on an empty stomach; it is not good to take them immediately after meals. It is very foolish to say that one should take medicines before meals for diseases of the lower body5 4 , and after meals for diseases of the upper body5 5 v L 1 . These are the sayings of people who do not even know how medicines workvin, so you should not let them concern5 6 you. I It refers to diagnosis by looking, which is one of the four diagnoses (looking H, listening and smelling f f f l, questioning F r l ] , and touching f s U ) . Looking entails scrutinizing the colour of the complexion, urine, faeces, and so on. I I It refers to abdominal diagnosis, palpating the abdominal area. For the popularity of abdominal diagnosis, see Chapter 2, sections on massage and hara. I I I In Byoka suchi , Hirano repeatedly mentions the importance of the secretion of bodily fluids via the pores the skin, in reference to jin and^ 9 1 ^ \u00ae . These are connected with the physiology of protective weiqi According to Huangti neijing , weiqi , which belongs to yang, is manifested in all kinds of bodily fluids except for blood. It is further divided into jing I f (essence), jin ^ (secretions such as saliva and sweat), qi % (corresponds, to a limited extent, to lymph), and ye (corresponds, to a limited extent, to brain fluids). It runs through the outer vessels, moistening and warming the flesh and skin, and protecting the body from external evils. On the other hand, structural yingqi/ki, which is paired with weiqi, belongs to yin and composes the blood that runs inside the vessels. Weiqi goes in and out through the pores of the skin owing to pulmonary respiration. Rising yawggz therefore, indicates cutaneous respiration, i.e., the secretion of bodily fluids from the pores These bodily fluids are called jin # , and take the form of sweat and other secretions. Hirano understands the secretion of jin fluids as \"moistening the skin's surface. Summary o f Lingshu, 'wuwei 'xieke 3 $ ^ ', and 'yingwei shenghui This also corresponds to the statement about the way in which disease poisons are expelled from the body, either by perspiration or by urine. I V The meaning of kaido is unknown, but it can be rendered with the characters Will, highway, which implies that the pores of the skin are the passageways through which bodily fluids enter and 5 2 R: tsukayuru.

Reprint in 1997, Zhonghuashuju, Beijing), 781. 71R: mengen. C: (M BS dizziness. This is attributed a statement of Mengzi in Shujing H\u00a3S (pre-Han, SSJZS edition, 'shuoming shang seems that the Classic School, particularly Yoshimasu Tod5, inclined to this view, because the same criticism is found in Yojoydron \"The Classic School quotes the statement that 'unless one feels dizzy with medicine, the illness will not heal'. Some even regard such symptoms as stomach ache and vomiting as \"dizziness\", and stubbornly believe that illness will not heal without dizziness. Dizziness means that you feel giddy and as though in a dream; that happens when you take a lot of monkshood.. .the Classic School believe that without dizziness and vomiting and diarrhoea, illness will not heal... these are all the same mistake.\" (Eisei 1:124-125). Nowadays, practitioners of traditional medicine consider that dizziness indicates a form of unexpected positive reaction to treatment. It is often regarded as a halfway process towards a cure, before the treatment has shown efficacy, possibly corresponding to \"crisis\" in Western medicine. In traditional medicine, both the lower and upper jiao M have functions in the digestive process. On the other hand Hirano roughly indicates the lower and upper body with these terms by appending the furigana gebu for - conventionally (lower part), and kami for AiM - conventionally _h (upper). v m The contention in Byoka suchi is that if the abdomen is already full of food, it has no further power to digest medicine (BS 1: 43). 303 3-6. Discussion of the reasons why diseases are transmitted {Byoka suchi fascicle Is page 34-40)1 Of all the diseases that exist, there are none that are not transmitted2. Unless you clearly know the reasons why they are transmitted3, you can neither avoid nor cure them. Nonetheless, it is still not easy for a layperson to understand the profound principles underlying this, however well it is explained. I will therefore just sketch an outline here [of how diseases are transmitted] to allow the general public to know about it. First of all you should bear in mind that the human body is endowed with the principles that govern all the myriad things between Heaven and Earth without exception, so that all diseases in the world occur from the correlation between inside and outside. Therefore for every possible disease, including cold damage, seasonal epidemics, t you must be aware1 3 1 R: y a m a n i n o u t s u r u b e k i wa k e o t o k u . C: 3\u00ae (Discussion of the reason why diseases transmitted). I translate the term \"utsuru\" as \"to transmit\" or \"transmission\" of disease because B y o k a s u c h i recognises that some diseases are contagious, while others are infectious, but sometimes the distinction seems unclear. For instance, in the case of venereal diseases such as syphilis or venereal scabies, the risk of contagion through sexual intercourse is repeatedly warned against. On the other hand, in the case of cold damage or epidemic fever, infectious pathogenic k i is thought to transmit diseases by inhalation or through the pores of the skin (via air k i n o u c h i ) . The combination of these two patterns, according to B y o k a s u c h i , should make one fear diseases such as diarrhoea, smallpox and leprosy, as the pathogenic poison in them is so strong that they are easily transmitted not only by direct contact, but also via the medium of air or breath. 2 R: u t s u r a (-zaru).

Among these diseases, some are unambiguous1 4 and easy to identify, while others are subtle and difficult to discern. Although some are difficult to distinguish and diagnose clearly, if you already know the obvious ones, you will naturally come to recognise the others. Suppose now there is a patient who is suffering from cold damage. It is neither transmitted1 5 from without, nor is it the kind of fever that arises from within. But if the patient chances to come into contact with cold air, the ki rising from the body1 6 becomes blocked, and the passage (of ki) in and out of the pore of the skin1 7 1 becomes more difficult, so that shivering and fever occur1 8 in order to counter these things. Unless the patient discharges [shivering and fever] through perspiration, the disease 10 Of) o igradually reaches the inside , so that the circulation in the vessels and abdomen diverges greatly from what is usual, thereby producing a kind of poisonous ki22. When that poison is transmitted to others, the symptoms2 3 are different from those of the person who first contracted the disease from the skin2 4 by coming into contact with cold air. The symptoms are more severe, and the disease is transmitted2 5 [to the second person] so fast that [the poison] does not reach the inside.2 6 At this point the symptoms come to resemble those of the disease of the person who transmitted2 7 the poison. If there happen to be differences, this is due to the difference in nature of 1 4 R: a r a w a . C: # consuming too much. 1 5 R: t s u t a e .

In this way, people become ill through the transmission2 8 of poison from one to another. However for those who get the disease first, the cause is attributable to temporary trouble such as the skin2 9 being blocked or lying in a place which is damp3 0 or a wall being newly painted. Even though the causes of the disease are various, it all happens in a moment, and the pent-up fever3 1 accumulates day by day, producing a kind of transmissible3 2 poison33. As for diseases such as smallpox3 4 measles3 5 , venereal scabies3 6 , and syphilis3 7 that were transmitted3 8 from foreign countries, the seeds of these diseases did not exist (in our country) from the earliest times at the beginning of the world. It is obvious that these diseases are transmitted via a kind of bad poisonous ki3 9 that forms in the bodies of people who have grown up in very barbarous countries4 0 where the weather is not quite right. This will be mentioned in the following sections about smallpox4 1 , syphilis4 2 and venereal scabies4 3 , so that you can cross-reference them. In addition, as for all the diseases that go under the name of cold damage, some of them come from the inside44, and so the causes of the disease4 5 need to be 2 8 R: t s u t a e .

This will be analysed later in the section on cold damage. In all cases in which poison is transmitted46, it is transmitted either through the skin4 7 or by inhalation through the mouth and nose. Therefore those people who fall asleep by the side of a patient with fever, or those who endure hunger and thin clothing, or tliose who have insufficiencies in their bodies due to disease, often get [this disease poison]. Therefore when you nurse a person with fever which is easily transmitted48, you should bear in mind [the pathology of fever]. Just as you easily catch cold in your sleep, you are likely to have an illness transmitted to you [by fever] when you lie down, so it is particularly bad to sleep near a patient. 4 6 R: utsuru .

Liu Yuancheng avoids a venomous snake on the way to the castle.\" i f e y 1\u00bb 308 But those people with an intense spirit4 9 of filial piety5 0 and benevolence5 1 have ki that floats out from the inner body to protect the area around the body5 2 . However close they approach to evil ki5 3 , they repel it and never let themselves be infected by it. This kim is not easily visible to the human5 4 eye, and it is extremely difficult to gain knowledge of it. Therefore those who do not have the training for this should pay particular attention5 5 to diet, sleeping and rising when engaged in nursing, (taking care) not to allow the body5 6 to become fatigued. They should not wear clothes that the patient has put on, and should not inhale the breath from the patient's mouth and nose, nor the odour of the [patient's] body and excrement. It is extremely bad to nurse while suffering hunger or sleepiness. Also people whose skin is vulnerable5 7 lv should not go near the bed of a patient with consumption. Nonetheless if the patient is one's parent or relative, nursing is indispensable, so one should prepare oneself beforehand so as to avoid infection. In particular if one goes to the tomb of somebody who has died from that [consumptive] disease in a hot season, one should be circumspect so as not to be affected by the evil A z 5 8 .

Furthermore those who devote themselves to nursing with a fervent spirit6 4 of loyalty, filial piety, and benevolence6 5 do not get infected by contact with such thing's as heat poison. There have been several examples6 6 [of this] both in China and Japan since ancient times and even nowadays we often witness it. However some cold-hearted folk leave nursing to others and do not go near the sickbed due to fear of the illness being transmitted to them, even when their family member or relative is suffering from cold damage or fever. This is not humane6 7 behaviour. Especially, an ill parent should be cared for even at the cost of one's life, and how dare one then fear infection? Now when their own child is ill, they sit up all night nursing it. When the child receives acupuncture, they feel as if they themselves are being pierced, and when the child receives moxibustion, they feel as if their own body is being burned. This is just because the child is one whom they themselves bore. Thus it is that one should not neglect the illness of the parents who gave birth to one. As to brothers and sisters, they are all equally children in the eyes of their parents. Relatives are all equally descendants in the eyes of the ancestors. But there are people who neglect [their care] as if it were other people's affair and hire someone else to do it, saying that they have no time or that another person is used to nursing. How detestable this is. When they treat even family like this, in the case of servants' illnesses they have no idea how they suffer. They just ask physicians for medicines, and do not even check 6 1 R: hizen-gasa . C: 6 7 R: ningen. C: A # human morality. 310 if [the patient] takes the medicines or not. If they hear that the illness may be serious or long, they immediately send the patient back home. Such behaviour is lacking in mercy or favour between master and servant. Should one not be fearful of punishment from Heaven? * We will now leave this subject for the time being. By the way, as for disease poisons, every cause is different and no two are the same. Thus one does not catch measles by getting6 8 smallpox6 9. Venereal scabies7 0 does not change into syphilis71. When one suffers from both intermittent fever7 2 and diarrhoea simultaneously, even when the intermittent fever ends, the diarrhoea is not cured at all and remains. If one is infected with trachoma7 3 , one always suffers from trachoma. Everything is this way. If there are a hundred kinds of diseases, there are a hundred kinds of poison, and if [there are] a thousand or ten thousand kinds [of diseases], [there are] a thousand and ten thousand kinds of poison. They are all different, just as the seed of each plant is different from every other one. The seed of a plant needs soil to grow vigorously, and the seed of disease is implanted in the human body where it grows to become a disease7 4 ; the principle is the same. Reasoning from the principle that there are no two identical things between Heaven and Earth, is this not the easiest thing to elucidate? Nonetheless ever since the physician appeared who put forward the theory of \"one poison as the cause of all diseases\"vn, there have been many people who recklessly mislead others by the abuse of those words. Laypersons should also bear this in mind. 6 8 R: uke (-te). C: Hi to transport. 6 R: yamai to naru. C: break out. 311 Also, once you clearly comprehend that the human body is endowed with diverse principles and correlates with a myriad phenomena, it will naturally become evident that, with regard to all the diseases that afflict the inner and outer body, entirely and without exception, if you catch them once in a lifetime, you will never get them again. Among them, the most obvious and easiest to recognise is the group of smallpox7 5 and measles7 6; likewise syphilis7 7 . Once it is rooted out7 8 , you will never catch syphilis again even if you see men or women who are syphilitic79. It is what people call \"picking out rashes\"V I U . If someone catches [syphilis] once again, it is because the disease has not been rooted out. If you recover from cold damage after experiencing such symptoms as initial shivering and fever, a swollen feeling in your abdomen, staring eyes, a yellow tongue, and delirium, you will never catch [cold fever] again. Even if the symptoms are similar, a comparison with the previous disease will tell you that the seed of the disease is different, so that the condition8 0 is not the same. With f t 1these things, unless you pay meticulous attention , it is hard to comprehend the principle and difficult to give credence. Thus I will not expatiate tediously on what is not essential8 2 . Even if the general public is unable to understand the deep underlying principle , just remember that all diseases are transmissible, and take care to prevent that. 7 5 R: C: Jlttr 8 8 2 urgent business. 8 3 \"The principle\" here indicates that each disease is attributed to a different pathogenic poison. 8 4 R: kokoro gaku. C: to consider. 312 1 JUlJfWlis and concern the physiology of protective weiqi (ki). See endnote C to Chapter 3-5. u This illustration shows that a person of filial piety is protected by a special ki Hr^v, that wards off danger. Yojoketsu contains the anecdote of Liu Yuancheng P J tM (1048-1125?): After being entrapped by a calumny, Liu Yuancheng left for Lingnan , travelling through the mountains with his mother. When a giant snake appeared to obstruct their path, Liu Yuancheng was able to repel the snake simply by facing it. Hirano claims that it was the shining light of Liu's filial piety that made the snake retreat (Eisei 3:161-162). I I I Despite sharing the idea of \"protection\", Hirano's interpretation of weiqi seems to deviate notably from the Chinese tradition. It is further explained in Yojoketsu (Eisei 3:161-164), According to that text, it is a kind of aura that surrounds and protects a person, called koki jfcW (shining light). The intensity of the shining light differs from person to person, depending on one's moral stature. The term can be traced to an anecdote about Confucius and Huan Zhui $EM: When Huan attempted to assassinate Confucius, the light of virtue radiating from Confucius's body preserved him from danger (~F0 Lunyu , 'xu'er iLffn'). Hirano argues that people often receive fatal damage from the \"split seam\" of shining light or protective ki: A little boy felt a kind of draught around one inch from his neck one morning. Later an arrow, shot during archery practice, most unfortunately hit the boy on the same spot on his neck, and he died from the injury. In this way, Hirano associates the meaning of \"protective kf ' with a numinous aura which is attributed to one's moral standing or fortune. I V lUJDa reflects the pathology of xu 1# (depletion): When one's zhengqi (right qi) becomes deficient, the powers of resistance of the organism fail. The balance between emptiness and fullness correlates with the conflict between zhengqi or yuangqi i.e. vitality, and evil qi, a pathogen. Byoka suchi views the pores of the skin as the route on the body's surface through which an evil pathogen will invade, if the pores are loose and open. v The third fascicle of Byoka suchi refers to the prevention of smallpox. During the Edo period, smallpox (and measles) were endemic, particularly as childhood diseases. Although a number of medical texts specifically discuss smallpox, it was only after the publication of Dandokuron fm by Hashimoto Hakuju (1810) that smallpox came to be acknowledged as a contagious disease. Previously, diverse opinions had coexisted, the cause being variously described as a poison inherited from one's parents, miasmas, or the agency of a smallpox demon. In Byoka suchi , smallpox is acknowledged as a disease that can be transmitted via the patient's tableware, clothing, ki, odour, cats, and even physicians (particularly when taking a pulse or using acupuncture needles). Therefore it is claimed that the best form of prevention is to avoid places where there are smallpox patients. Variolation is mentioned with the qualification \"I have heard that it is practised in foreign countries\", but no reference to vaccination is found in Byoka suchi. Variolation began to be carried out in Japan in the late eighteenth century, particularly in Ryukyu (present-day Okinawa) and the Kyushu area. However, the statement in Byoka suchi implies that the practice was not yet common in the city of Edo. The first vaccination was carried out in 1849 by Narabayashi Soken (1801-1852). For the history of the of Fukase Yasuaki 2002, Tennento measles, Byoka suchi contends that it is possible to prevent its spread if measures are taken to exclude any foreign vessels, cutting off the route by which the disease is imported. V l The fifth fascicle of Byoka suchi discusses the prevention of syphilis and scabies: One does not get infected with syphilis and scabies unless one comes into contact with people who possess the disease poison, most typically via sexual intercourse or kissing. It is further noted that the disease poison is found also in saliva, sweat, faeces, breast milk, and medical instruments such as acupuncture needles or forceps, and that one should therefore avoid touching them (BS 5:1-3, 12-13). w This theory, called the theory of Manbyo ichidoku (one poison for all diseases), was established by Yoshimasu Todo. For details, cross-reference Chapter 2, footnote 18. V 1 U Byoka suchi, like many other medical texts, divides the development of smallpox into several stages: incipient fever, growth of pox iH IU I (mizu 'umi), development of pustulation formation of scabs (kasa). \"Kasa o kakinukitaru (to scratch off pox)\" indicates the restoration of pox, which was considered to be the last stage of the disease as well as 313 offering the promise of survival. At the time of restoring the pox, the ceremonial custom called sasayu or sakayu M M was widely practised, in which the patient is bathed or wiped with hot water containing sake-wine, the whitish water from rice-washing, red beans and salt. This curative method was considered to facilitate the restoration of pox. However the arguments for and against this custom vary depending on the medical text. For example, Byoka suchi warns against the risks of bathing too early. For the general history of smallpox in Japan, see Donald R Hopkins 1983, Peasants and Princes: Smallpox in History , (Chicago University Press, Chicago), 105-118, 128-132, Ann Jannetta Bowman 1987, Epidemics and Mortality in Early Modern Japan , (Princeton University Press, Princeton), Tatsukawa Shoji 1979, Kinseiyamai no soshi, (Heibonsha, Tokyo), 150-175. sasayu ceremony, see Maekawa Ken 1976, 'Change of Sasayu Ceremony with the Lapse of Time in the Edo era', in Nihon ishigaku zasshi , vol. 22.

Discussion of what persons engaged in nursing should bear in mind (Byoka suchi fascicle 1: page 40-54)1 Nursing means not only taking care of patients when they are eating and chinking, sleeping or sitting up, or taking medicines. There are three issues at stake: The first is the prevention of any sign of disease. This is a concern for those people who are always worried2 about everything and have been depressed3 for a long time. Their blood4 transport5 slackens so that their complexions become pale, and they feel drowsy6 and unrefreshed7. Their thinking8 becomes distorted, and their minds9 become congealed1 0 . Along with these things, the circulation of vital ki] ] slows down, and they feel that their inner body1 2 is slightly chilled compared to usual. The cause of 1 ^this depression stems from the stirring-up of feelings of sorrow, cowardice, love and missing1 [someone], which cannot be stopped. Those who watch closely and discern promptly the state of mind1 4 [of the patient] should take great care1 5 to comfort and admonish him or her with the best words they can think of, in order to clear1 6 up what 1 7 1 f tis congealed . Otherwise if the depression lasts for a matter of days, to the point of 1 R: Kanbyonin no kokoroe o toku.

C: to be congested. 315 disturbing sleep at night and gradually exhausting1 9 the mind2 0 , the blood will become thin , and the state of blood circulation and abdominal digestion will deteriorate. Gradually it will either form a clump2 4 within the abdomen, or manifest as diseases like consumption, or kan2 5 , or madness, transforming into myriads of [other] diseases. Eventually some of them will become very serious. You should not consider this kind of case lightly or neglect it at first. Whether there is joy or anger, if it hinders sleep at night, you should remember that it will invariably cause harm later on, and therefore measures should be taken promptly. Also 7ft 77 7ftif people become unusually depressed, sad, fearful , worried , or uneasy without any reason, or suddenly become angry2 9 and mortified, it is a sign of kan3 0 or madness. When people are angry and mortified for a long time, [their] ki runs in reverse. So it is that for some persons, the whole body inclines upward3 1 , the inner head becomes heated, and the complexion becomes red; the sinews twitch and the muscles cramp. This is because anger oppresses the soul3 3 , and if [the oppression] becomes too intense, sometimes people fall down in a fit3 4. Therefore people who easily get angry3 5, who 1 8 R : ki ofusagu koto . C : Ht\u00a7, depression. 1 9 C: to languish. 2 R: meguri.

Haradachi is conventionally written as (standing-up of the abdomen), which seems to suggest the view of the abdomen as the centre of mind, and the association of anger with the upward movement of ki (in the abdomen). 316 are what is called \"hot-tempered [having pent-up kari\\\"> are likely to 7 , madness, and consumptive diseases3 8 \". Moreover, they usually suffer from [conditions] such as dizziness or headache, and suffer from apoplexy3 9 when they become old. Also such [things] as excessive pleasure40, indulging in alcohof and sex, sleeping in the daytime and staying up all night, exhausting one's energy4 1 in reading and the arts, and [in general] going beyond one's capacity, should all be restrained. Nonetheless, using4 2 up one's energy4 3 in study or the arts is not as harmful as damaging the body due to worry, anger44, alcohol and sex, and so should not be forcefully prevented. This needs consideration depending on the particular person. The above points are all concerned with preventing disease when there is no sign of it yet. The second issue [of nursing] concerns those who have already become ill. They should ponder the cause of the disease and immediately request treatment4 5 from a skilled physician. In seven or eight out of ten cases, if initial treatment is given properly, the disease will be cured without becoming too drastic. A rough sketch (of how this principle works) is as follows. There are those people who suffer from ulcers on the penis4 6 in the initial stage of syphilis, and those who get venereal scabies4 7 only in five or six spots on the fingertips, but otherwise do not 3 6 R: konki. C: i$ S consciousness. 4 4 R: urei-ikari. C: to grieve and worry. 4 5 R; r y o j i . C: diagnosis. 4 6 R: sao no dekimono. C: TW'JIf ulcers on the genitalia. Sao is conventionally written as ^ or W - (pole), implying the penis. 4 7 R: hizen. C: venereal scabies, 317 experience itching anywhere else. The beginnings4 8 of cold damage can be cured by perspiration. Vomiting blood or bleeding from the anus should be halted immediately. Those who are about to go mad and cannot sleep at night should receive treatment that helps them to sleep. Those who sleep too heavily should be woken up promptly. The sick themselves should recognise the signs of apoplexy4 9 and take precautions. Women can cure genital bleeding5 0 by applying techniques when medicines have no effect. For loose bowels at the initial stage, people will gain prompt benefits through perspiration. If one feels strong tension around the anus5 1 , one should purge as soon as possible. C*)In the cases of vomiting and diarrhoea disease , (if there is no vomiting and no evacuation yet), the patient should vomit and evacuate promptly. (On the other hand) if vomiting and diarrhoea are severe, they should be stopped as soon as possible. You should note that sometimes disease occurs without constipation. For various diseases during pregnancy and after childbirth, you should not rely on the efficacy of medicine. [Such diseases] cannot be cured without procedures53. Bleeding from cuts should be stopped at once. Internal bleeding5 4 due to bruising should be drained immediately. Wrenched bone and muscle should be treated at once before the area gets swollen. For dog bites and all other kinds of animal and poisonous insect5 5 bites, there will be no harm later on only if the poison is removed promptly. An infant's vomiting breast-milk should not be taken lightly. If a roundworm5 6 lives in the 4 8 R: yami hajime. C: syndrome on the surface. apoplexy. 5 0 1 R: shimo e kakuran. L vomiting and R: waza. C: technique. 5 4 R: congestion. 5 7 , regardless of whether it is that of an adult or a child, it will spread and cause various troubles unless it is evacuated promptly. When the illness of a mother or wet-nurse is transmitted5 8 through breast milk, causing the child to suffer, the illness5 9 of the mother or wet-nurse should be cured before that of the child. r There are a number of examples of this sort. Thus, if you pay attention6 0 at the outset and treatment strikes the crux [of the trouble], I can hardly express fully how quickly you will be able to escape from harm. If the illness is cured before it becomes serious, the patient may not give credit to the physician, yet the means6 1 [of treatment in fact] largely depends on whether the physician is good or bad. Although this is most difficult for laypersons to understand, if you promptly consult a physician who has a deeply sincere heart and who pays great attention to technique, there will be no mistakes. Physicians who are proud and superficial6 3 do not like to make this kind of unseen effort [of providing proper treatment before the illness becomes serious]. What is more, they often miss the exact timing [of treatment] and thus bring about later harm without realising it. If you entirely believe their [quack] sophistry and flowery words6 4 , and their incoherent diagnosis, you will not realise that your body6 5 could be destroyed. How extremely regrettable this is. The third issue [with regard to nursing] concerns those people whose illnesses have already progressed, and who have lost their appetite and need help from others in 5 7 R: hara no uchi. C: IS inside the body. 5 8 R: tsutawari . C: U fii to transmit. 5 9 R: yamai. C: suffering due to illness. 6 0 R: kokoro. C: M . intention. 6 1 R: k u . C: plan. 6 2 kokoro. R: mi. C: f t body. 319 order to sit up and to lie down to sleep. Of course they rely on the effects of medicine, but it makes a huge difference whether the person engaged in nursing takes good care of them or not. The proverb says that the physician's part is thirty percent, while nursing is seventy percent. But there are very few people who really know about nursing; many know almost nothing. For there is a right time to give meals, and [there is] a right amount of medicine to give. If you force medicines or meals [upon the patient] heedlessly, the abdominal power of the patient will not be able to bear it, so that neither medicines nor food can settle down6 6 and will stagnate. All this causes harm, not benefit. The flavours of medicines are naturally unbalanced1 1 1 . Usually it is the case that if people with weak6 7 abdominal power6 8 who are otherwise free of illness take too much medicine, they will find it difficult even to eat. If those patients who are [actually] ill and whose abdominal6 9 circulation7 0 differs from what is usual take imbalanced medicines to excessive, problems are inevitable. Therefore be careful not to mix medicines and meals together. Allow the drinking of hot water and tea with caution, and have the patient take medicine when there seems to be room7 1 in the 1 0 7 0abdomen . The essence of medicine circulates around the whole body in order to be effective. So if there is no room in the abdomen, there is no power to distribute it from the abdomen7 4 to the whole body, and there can be no efficacy. Also all meals should be a little less [in amount] than the capacity of the patient. Where the condition of the patient's abdomen has worsened , and the patient has 6 6 R: ochitsuki. descend. 8 R: power. 6 9 R: hara . fliPf intestines and stomach. 7 0 R: meguri. ill M l transport. 7 1 R: vacant space. 7 2 R: hata inner abdomen. transport. 7 4 R: hara and stomach. 7 5 R: guai. C: $1\u00ae] function. 320 lost the taste for food, if you force food on them beyond their capacity, it is just like grinding too much cereal on a worn-out millstonetv . It will inevitably cause stagnation and harm. Moreover if you serve a meal immediately after the patient has taken medicine or administer a decoction no sooner than the patient has finished drihking hot water and tea, how could this be bearable even for a person who is calm and healthy? This is all the more so for the patient whose energy78 is depleted79. However, some people, thinking that the more medicine one takes the better it will be, take several dozens of pills and powders by day and night in addition to separately prescribed decoctions. What is the matter with them? Whatever the medicines are, you should take no more than five to seven kinds at most. Those who have been ill for a long time8 0 and are delicate8 1 should not take more than three or four kinds. Even this [rule about the amount of medicines] needs [further consideration], since there are drug sellers and physicians8 2 who dispense many medicines just because they want to increase prescription numbers. The family of a sick person want a prompt cure and may press [the patient] to take8 3 more and more medicines. Consequently even those who in the beginning had almost their usual appetite will gradually develop an aversion to food. It is because these patients have absorbed many medicines with unbalanced flavours into the abdomen8 4 , and the power [in the body] that competes with the medicines cannot tolerate this. 7 6 R: hara no uchi.

Looking at those medicines, [I see that] they combine many of those materials that most easily stagnate, such as ginseng8 6 , wakegi green onion8 7 . If they make [the patient] drink more of them, the circulation8 9 of the abdomen9 0 becomes worse91, and phlegm9 2 and stagnated drink9 3 fill up the abdomen9 4 and [all] the functions9 5 slows down. Thus the body9 6 gradually languishes, vital energy9 7 is ever more weakened9 8, and incurable disease eventually develops. It is then that the physician cunningly says that he had thought it would be so from the beginning. That is why he only prescribed replenishing medicines9 9 ^ and if the disease is not to be cured, that is the order of Heaven, Even the family of the patient say that the patient is destined to die, if there is no improvement despite using many and various medicines like Korean ginseng1 0 0 regardless of the cost, and spending so much effort. Eventually no one realises in the slightest that the initial treatment was erroneous. Everything may well depend on numbers allotted by Heaven, but I think it is a pity for the patient. We may leave amateurs aside, but how can physicians, who live by medicine, unnecessarily distress patients without knowing 8 5 R: otoroe. C: weakened. 8 6 R: the intestine and stomach. 91R: ashiku.

C: nourishing and replenishing. 1 0 C: H ginseng (panax ginseng ). 322 thisV I ? If their mentality is not greedy, it is at least unreasonable1 0 1 . Rather than taking medicines from such physicians, it is much better to get a middle-ranking physician who does not use medicines. This is why people think prayers or talismans have efficacy. * i n oWhat you should next bear in mind is as follows: Regardless of the cold or heat of the season and the weather, people shut the doors and screens [even] when it is boiling hot, dress the [the patient] warmly and lay on piles of covers. When they find that the patient is suffering from too much heat and sweating profusely, they claim that 1 fUthe patient should not be exposed to the wind at all, quoting the words of a physician to the effect that those who sweat profusely should not be exposed to the wind. So they make the patient use a chamber pot to urinate and defecate1 0 4 even if he/she is able to walk to the toilet. As to food and decoctions, in turn they force only hot things [on the patient], thereby adding heat from both within and without. If they do so, how can a patient who is already weakened bear it? Now as an experiment, try placing a person who is free from illness in such a situation for three or four days. However healthy the person is, there is no one who would not become ill1 0 5 . What absurd behaviour! Therefore, when it comes to what people regard as serious diseases, seven or eight times out of ten, incurable symptoms are created by the mistaken attitude of physicians and the family of the sick. Generally speaking, people with a disease cannot tolerate what they usually can. So depending on the season and the weather, you should arrange things to suit the 1 0 1 R: wake wakaranu. C: ignorance. 1 0 2 R: kokorou to recognise. 1 0 C: to touch. 1 0 4 excretion. 1 0 5 R: wazurai. C: pain of sickness. 323 bodily comfort of the patient. If the person engaged in nursing feels at ease by the patient's side, that is good for the patient, too. It is absurd to think that it is good to warm everything up just because there is illness. More or less anything that is not usual invariably does harm. Depending on status1 0 6 , whether noble or humble, rich' or poor, the treatment for the patient varies. However, it is good to adhere to what is habitual for the body. Recently in the countryside a beggar [woman]1 0 7 came to a village to ask for food, bringing with her a child with smallpox at the stage of discharging pus1 0 8 . Seeing this and feeling pity, the master of a rich household led them into a separate building1 0 9 beside the kitchen. He very kindly1 1 0 gave them food, invited a physician to prescribe medicines, and let them stay there until the child's pox had dried up1 1 1 . The beggar mother1 1 2 was pleased also. However at midnight that night, the abundantly i indischarging pox suddenly became worse , and [the child] suffered agonies. Surprised and alarmed1 1 4 , they sent for a physician to conduct an examination. This physician must have been an acute man1 1 5 , for he said that such a change in symptoms came from suddenly shutting up in a room a child who had grown completely used to cold wind, frost, and snow, and had not minded them in the slightest. [The physician] told them to try and see what would happen if they left the child outdoors, spreading a straw mat outside in the middle of the night, and letting the beggar parent and child stay there. When morning came, they found that the pox had readily appeared again, 1 0 6 R: hodo. C: differentiation. 1 0 7 R: 1 0 8 R: pouring pus. 1 0 9 R: betsuya.

C: IS to be removed. 1 1 4 excited. 1 1 5 R: kokoro kiki C: keen. 324 and that the pus had drained1 1 6 completely; and it later dried up1 1 7 without any problems. So I have heard. This indicates that an initial change in symptoms occurs due to acting counter to usual conditions. Therefore you should assume that this is the reason why thfcre is no advantage in suddenly making things different from usual1 1 8 just because of disease. It is also the same1 1 9 for a rich family. It does no good to shut up the air of the sick room in spring or winter, saying that the weather is cold.1 2 0 vm From time to time it is recommended to open up the partitions and screens at the comers of the rooms a little1 2 1 , in order to let the confined air1 2 2 out and let good air1 2 3 in. Even more in the warm weather at the end of spring or in the heat of summer and autumn, how harmful it is to make the patient sleep in a place where there is no air movement. Worst of all is a place where the sun's rays shine strongly. It is not advantageous to hang up a net for protection against mosquitoes. When it is hot, or on a windless day, inside the house you might direct a breeze onto the pillow of the patient by using a fan. If the patient says that he/she feels comfortable1 2 4 , you should not worry1 2 5 . If there are many rooms, it is good in all seasons to change the bedroom of the sick from time to time. This is because human beings live1 2 6 by breathing in1 2 7 the ki of Heaven and Earth, just as fish live in water. The inhaled kim naturally contains good fa * 1 2 9 lx which 1 6 R: sosogi.

What moves and makes sound, we call wind, whereas what is calm and silent, we call ki. It is just like water and waves. Of all the myriad things that have form1 3 5 and are useful,' there is nothing that is not attributable to the nourishment of this ki. Yet the exhaled ki is the 1 1 7dregs that are of no use for nourishment , so it is not good to inhale it again even if it is breathed out by a person tree of illness. This is even more so [with the air breathed out] from people who are ill. Their blood 1 3 8 circulation 1 3 9 differs 1 4 0 with respect to the usual bad things 1 4 1 that accumulate1 4 2 in the stomach1 4 3 ' , so that the smell of the exhaled ki1 4 4 is unbearable. Thus if the room is filled with this bad ki1 4 5 and the patient breathes in and out there, you will witness that the disease1 4 6 progresses further and further. [The patient] not only misses the opportunity to be cured, but also in this way a mild case becomes serious and a serious case invariably culminates in death.

If it is not possible to change rooms, then from time to time move the patient's futon, throw open the doors and windows there, clean and tidy up neatly, and then put back [the futon] as it was. With any illnesses, do not forget these cautions1 4 8 . ' Do not place many candles and heating devices in the room, for if fire ki is excessive, it is not good for the patient. It is extremely harmful. For the patient with a fever, sometimes pour one or two cupsx of strong vinegar into a ceramic pot, and warm it over a low fire, thereby filling the room with the ki of vinegar which is able to remove the stagnant ki. It is also good to change the patient's clothes from time to time for new ones. Dirty clothes with an odour should be avoided. Even things such as screens may sometimes be changed. As for the nursing attendant, refrain from employing those who have scabies1 4 9 or fever, or whose body or underarms stink; [likewise] women who are menstruating1 5 0 , or who have not yet taken a bath after childbirth, or who have not yet bathed and changed cloths after dealing with a corpse. It is also not good to nurse1 5 1 while wearing dirty and smelly clothes. For all patients, maintaining balance1 5 2 with regard to the bedroom, clothes and food, and nursing care makes such a difference1 5 3 to the course1 5 4 of the illness. So you must not think of these lightly. You may think that such problems1 5 5 mostly befall the poor but rarely the rich, but this is not the case. Servants and maids to a rich family are afraid of others' 1 4 7 R: wakimae. C: to be enlightened. 1 4 8 caution. 1 4 9 R: no toki. C: fsB# time of the monthly sign. 1 5 1 R: kangaku.

Even if they are aware1 5 7 of something, no one will open their mouth. Only to other people [outside the family] do they put it about that this is a serious matter1 5 8 . They put up partitions and screens in the heat, and make the patient wear layer upon layer of clothing, but never talk about Changing clothes. They consider that it is their duty1 5 9 , as the proverb says, to nurse1 6 0 so as \"not to offend anybody*1 \". They leave decocting medicines to a serving-maid, merely enumerating1 6 1 the number of meals and excretion of both kinds1 6 2 on the patient's 1 notes, trying to make excuses with flattering words simply in order to defend themselves. [The servants who nurse] just think of finishing their shift and having a rest1 6 4 . All they wish is that nothing will happen during the day, and no more than that1 6 5 . Nowadays the attitude toward patients of [the households of] feudal lords1 6 6 is mostly like this. It is similar with some wealthy merchants1 6 7 . Therefore patients in a rich 1 A Rhousehold are treated worse than those in a poor one . It is assumed that a mild case will always become difficult, and a difficult case will gradually progress to a serious condition1 6 9 , and the patient will inevitably die. This happens because of this kind of [social] custom. If you are the person doing the nursing, remember that if the patient becomes 5 6 R: hihan.

C: lowly and humble. 328 melancholy1 7 0 , you should talk about whatever will gladden the patient's mind1 7 1 , and not speak of the illness, or make the patient's mind grow congealed1 7 2 . Or else you can talk of a play at the theatre or amusements, or tell funny stories1 7 3 you have heard from people. Sometimes tales of brave heroes are particularly good. Meanwhile talk [also] of the principles of the sage and the wise, and how they settled1 7 4 difficulties, thereby preventing the patient from falling into grudges against Heaven or blaming other people. In nursing, even if [the patient] is not a blood relative, one should wholeheartedly take good care of them . The human body is a container of diseases, so you can never predict beforehand what disease1 7 8 you may develop and when, or from whom you may receive nursing1 7 9 . Therefore, not only with relatives but also with friends and colleagues, you should think a great deal of your usual friendships, and sincerely1 8 0 do your best at the time of their illness. Even with your servants or retainers, when they are ill, you should take good care of1 8 1 them. Do not treat them inconsiderately1 8 2 at all, and do not mind dirty things*1 1 . There is no better hidden virtue1 8 3 than this. Buddha taught that nursing ranks first among the eight virtues*1 1 1 . 6 9 R: muzukashiki sho.

In particular, the patient [feels] different depending on whether it is1 8 5 day or night, or hot or cold. Thus you should question the [patients] now and then, and stroke1 8 6 the skin and feel their hands and legs, in order to know if they are chilled or warm, to tell if they are awake or sleeping, and to see1 8 7 if their clothes are too light or 1 f t f i 1 f i Otoo heavy. Check if the inside of the mouth is dry, and give hot water and tea appropriately. Stroke1 9 0 or massage1 9 1 or scratch wherever [the patients] feels pain or itching, thereby satisfying their heart1 9 2 . Furthermore, patients who spend a long time [lying in bed] find they cannot bear having their hands and legs close together or stretched out. You should pay attention1 9 3 to this. In addition you must not be careless about opening and closing doors and screens, so as not to allow them to perspire1 9 4 with heat or be exposed1 9 5 to the wind on a cold night. The greatest attention 1 9 6 should be paid to the quantities of food and 1 0*7excretions : Firstly, consider what the patient eats and check it against the amount of excreta. Secondly, you must remember that scanty urination is extremely bad in the case of chronic disease. Thirdly, however little appetite [the patient has], if there has 8 4 R: kokoro.

C: M intention. 330 been no bowel movement for several days, you should consider with good reason that the circulation of abdominal ki 1 9 8 is bad1 9 9 . Fourthly, [look at] the colour of the excretions, and [see] if they have a smell or not2 0 0 . Fifthly, [examine] the amount of urine day and night. When the colour is cloudy, it sometimes appears yellowish, reddish, sooty, cloudy, or contains dregs or oil. Also, the smell varies from one time to another. Thus it is of no use merely to remember the frequency [of urination]. If physicians do not ask detailed questions about these matters, they are thoughtless. It should be the special care of the nursing attendant to pay attention in this way, so as not to become distracted by other things. When you sit by the patient, do not do such things as reading books, saying that you are bored, let alone such things as playing go or shogfn (Japanese chess), which should be strictly prohibited. In particular when your parents are ill, though you cannot neglect your duty to your lord, it is best to leave all other family business to someone else unless it is extremely important2 0 3 * * . However if your parents are worried about2 0 4 the family business despite being sick in bed, you had better deal with it appropriately, thereby easing their minds. However grave2 0 5 the disease is, if things do not suit your parent's frame of mind, it is against the way of cultivating the will, and [shows] a lack of filial piety. Also, even when your parent is ill, from time to time when the illness has subsided, you can choose someone else among the relatives who suits2 0 6 your parent's 1 9 7 R: tsuji.

Meanwhile, however short it may be, you should take a rest and calm your mind2 0 7 , in order not to become fatigued2 0 8 during the time of emergency. This is even more the case when the sickness is among servants. You should have them take special care when working, so as not to get tired. Even if they make minor mistakes, never scold or abuse them. Vigilance must however be exercised in maintaining the separation of men and women. Adultery sometimes has a bad effect on the sick, so do not relax or tamper with2 1 0 this rule. Make them obedient and deal with them mercifully and pay them money [for their services]. What is more, do not hesitate to spend money on the sick. Considering that [one's] usual preparations2 1 1 are intended for just such ah occasion, do your best as far as you can. Do not speak loudly near the sick room. Do not laugh gaily2 1 2 without good reason. Do not let [the sick] talk about others' difficulties2 1 3 or death from illness2 1 4 or A ir[other] discouraging stories. Do not allow near sick people those who are useless and those who do not agree with the heart2 1 6 of the sick. If it is a grave disease2 1 7 that physicians decline to treat, and others also find to be incurable, leave aside everything else so as to satisfy the wishes2 1 8 of the sick. Do not force on them such medicines as are difficult to drink. Depending on whether the sick person is prepared [for death], it is also possible to stop using medicines altogether. How can one so fear the 2 0 7 R: ki. C: iff # spirit. 2 0 8 R: R: midasu. C: \u00ae to relax. 2 1 1 R :yoi. C: I f i f saving. 2 1 2 R: warai kyd (-zu).

If the sick person is not well prepared, [however], send for physicians and use medicines until they die. In addition, among 77fithe sick who are not well prepared, many are grieved at being separated frdm blood relatives2 2 1 and lose2 2 2 their right mind. If you find them to belong to this kind, it is wrong to reveal to them that they are certainly going to die. These are the things that you should bear in mind2 2 3 most particularly. When you find that the time of death is drawing near, you had better not let the sick person see their young children or grandchildren, or other relatives that they are deeply attached to. This is because if the feeling2 2 4 of attachment is present in the interval of agony, it will be an obstacle at the time of death. It is recommended that the room should be kept very clean and quiet. If a neighbour is playing the koto, shamisen , flute or hand drum', send someone who is at hand to beg them to stop playing for a while. This is because if such a sound reaches the ears of the sick, it will be a great obstacle at the time of death. Now when [the sick person] is about to breathe their last2 2 5 , it is not good for relatives to gather round and weep with sorrow226. They should cry after the sick person has died. If someone cannot bear it and cries aloud, 777 77ft *send that person elsewhere immediately. It is against filial piety for a child to let a sick parent hear the crying of relatives when death approaches. Thus you should bear this in mind beforehand, and never ever forget it. If you find that the sick person must 2 1 9 R: h i t o n o s a t a . C: \u00a7 \u00a3 # criticism and praise. 2 2 0 R: k a n a s h i m i . C: feel pain. 2 2 1 R: k e n z o k u .

When this is accomplished, the agony at the time of death naturally becomes less severe, and this is a great benefit to the sick. If it is not done with a sincere heart, it is utterly useless to ask people like priests or shamans to pray. Many of these priests and shamans are unfeeling , and so their prayers and talismans are just for greed. How can they bring about any auspicious result? Especially for those whose Heaven-given lifespan is coming to an end, how can they possibly repulse death? You should ponder that QiuX V H \" Confucius - stated \"it has been long since I have prayed (I do not pray),,xvul. Even if the Heaven-given lifespan is not exhausted, [they say] \"when you pray, if you have no fortune, that is your fortune as you do not have faith in prayer\" X 1 X If you appreciate this, there will be no acceptance2 3 1 from the Gods or Buddha, and it [prayer] will do no good2 3 2 to the sick. In ancient China, when King Wu of the Zhou dynasty became ill, [the king's brother] Dan, Duke of Zhou prayed to become ill in the king's stead.5 The prayer was answered immediately, and the illness of the King Wu, which had been so critical, was soon cured . This was attributed to the brotherly devotion of Dan, Duke of Zhou, and his deep anxiety about unrest within the nation. In addition, when the Emperor Taizongx x l of the Yuan dynasty was about to die, Yelu Chucai2 3 4 , who was prime minister at the time, consulted with the empress, and 2 2 9 R: shukke . C: iSIR Followers hakujo. C: frivolous. 231R: noju. C: 3 2 R: yoroshikarazaru. C: T^ll no benefit. 2 3 3 R: sassoku . C: T' 0 before long. 2 3 4 Yelu Chucai (1190'\" '-'1244) was a politician as well as a prominent intellectual of the time. He served the first two emperors of the Yuan dynasty, Taizu A^il and Taizong Atk and established the political foundation of the nation. Despite his contribution, however, Yelu Chucai met his political downfall after the death of the emperor Taizong. 334 forthwith promulgated a grand amnesty. He pardoned thereby all prisoners, convicts, eunuchs and bureaucrats. On that very evening, the arrested pulse of the emperor began to throb again, and he revived.**1 1 This emperor had at first entrusted political matters to Yelu Chucai. However [the emperor] was by nature fond of alcohol,\" and this tendency became most excessive in his later years. In the end he would not accept the admonitions of Yelu Chucai, and left wicked people in charge of [state] affairs. It often happened that people were promoted due to bribery2 3 6 , lives were saved by the power of money2 3 7 , and innocent people were arrested. Yelu Chucai, clearly knowing the consequences of punishment from Heaven, made the emperor declare a grand amnesty. [Chucai's] merciful benevolence impressed Heaven and Earth, and the dying emperor was thereby restored to life again. This is quite reasonable. Nowadays, feudal lords [in time of] illness should know that, rather than relying on mountain ascetics2 3 9 or Buddhist priests, it would be a grander act of charity2 4 0 to abstain from luxury, prohibit the taking of life, lighten the punishment for criminals, and reduce the official duties2 4 1 of the people. However these matters are the business * 2 4 2of those who reign over provinces and counties. They are things that lowly ones are not in a position to carry out. Nonetheless, the pursuit of virtue2 4 3 and the accumulation of hidden virtues2 4 4 all proceed from one's own mind. If you always 2 3 5 R: y o k a r a n u h i t o .

It does not necessarily mean that there will be no response unless you save many lives and distribute large quantities of money. But it depends on one's means. For those who have both wealth and power, these things are easy to carry out. Thus if they help people in trouble, distribute alms to the poor, admonish against killing, and save lives to the extent of their powers, they will grasp the spirit of creation between Heaven and Earth as their own like Yelu Chucai. Invariably they will receive a response that will change the lifespan allotted by Heaven, avert disaster and bring happiness. Consider the helpless poor who find that even a hundred small coins and a cup of rice are not enough to maintain their parents2 4 6 and support a wife and children. Yet if they have a sincere mind like Dan, Duke of Zhou, so that they are willing to suffer illness in place of a parent2 4 7 or brother, how can there be no response from the Gods and Buddha? However this is the most difficult thing for a human being. Only if you are able to carry this out, will you attain more auspicious results than influential people who give money2 4 8 in charity. All in all, with regard to accumulating goodness and planting virtues, it is most noble to be true and not false. Therefore it is right to pray in good faith, devotedly following the way of filial piety and loyalty in keeping with the mind2 4 9 of the Gods and Buddha. 2 4 5 R: kudoku. C: success. 2 4 6 R: oya.

Water dripping device (BS 1: 49) 337 When you go to sleep, first of all make your mind lie down to rest, then make your eyes lie down. This is the teaching of the ancients: Before sleepiness comes to <)rA a c iyou, let go of any thoughts, calm your mind , keep your soul within yourself, and [then] go to bed. Then you will not have nightmares and will feel peaceful in your sleep. The soul2 5 2 regains power through sleep, so that after waking up, they say, the body becomes refreshed and disease is naturally prevented. Yet with people who have shaku2 5 3 or a difficult nature2 5 4 , or those whose emotions of delight, anger, sorrow or joy tend to be moved precipitately, various things begin to stir in the mind when they are about to fall asleep. This troubles the mind , so that even when your eyes are tired, the mind cannot fall asleep. If you sometimes shut your eyes, you will have nightmares2 5 8 , and you will find no comfort in sleep. If every night is like this, both body and mind gradually become exhausted , the circulation of the blood deteriorates2 6 3 , and sometimes it eventually results in the formation of a clump in the abdomen2 6 4 . With people who have a difficult nature2 6 5 of this kind, we find that they often have difficulty in sleeping, especially when they develop a chronic disease; and 2 5 0 R: kokoromochi.

If you just leave them in this state, it sometimes becomes a cause of difficult disease2 6 7 all over again. Nonetheless, you should not blindly use sleeping drugs2 6 8 , which people make much use of nowadays, without investigating the symptoms. Although it requires consideration depending on the patient, even many physicians do not make these distinctions2 6 9 and fail their patients. Thus it is not something that amateurs can understand2 7 0 . Now the picture below shows a method2 7 1 of sleep inducement that is different from [that of sleeping drugs]. It will do no harm even if it is used blindly without examining the symptoms in detail. I have also experimented with this extensively. The method is as follows: Build an apparatus like a temporary downpipe with a small washbasin next to it, and let the water drip down with the tempo of pounding a rice cake. It is a technique that allows the patient to count the pattering sounds of the water, 0 * 7 0thereby dismissing thoughts and calming the mind, leading to peaceful sleep. Nonetheless you should ensure that any people nearby are quiet or carry this out in a 0 0 * \\ room where there is no noise ; otherwise there will be little effect. So [when] you try this out on a patient, bear this concern in mind 2 7 4 . 2 6 6 R: muzukashiki sho . 2 6 7 disease. 2 6 hypnotic. 2 6 9 R: shabetsu. in detail. 2 7 0 shiru.

Consumption was also called burabura - byo (disease of idleness), which reflects the general assumption that many consumption patients were adolescents (particularly ujimarried girls of high status). Suzuki 2000, 57-19. Tatsukawa 1998,199-214. u For the pathology of mental disorders (mostly categorised as kan in Byoka suchi ) and its relation with kan, and the reverse movement of ki, see Chapter 2, massage. I U In traditional pharmacology, many drugs are considered to be poisonous by nature. For instance, Shennong bencaojing an authority on pharmacotherapy, classifies 365 kinds of crude drugs (of plant, mineral or animal origins) into three categories called sovereign, minister and assistant: all sovereign drugs (jun H\") are free of poison, some minister drugs (chen [5 ) are poisonous while others are not, and assistant drugs ( zuoshi !\u00a3#[) are poisonous by nature and should not be taken for long periods. Many drugs used for treating illness belong to the third category, assistant drugs. This is why Hirano warns that every precaution is needed when taking medicines as the nature of medicines is not always harmless. ,v The metaphor of comparing digestive function to the movement of a millstone is commonly found in Edo yojo texts. See Chapter 2, section on konare. v nourishing and replenishing medicines. Replenishing medicines were used to replenish what is depleted in the body, thereby restoring a man to the state of full strength. For instance aconite was particularly popular during the Edo period, applied to ki depletion as a tonic or warming drug. However Byoka suchi criticises the tendency for amateurs to use medicines lightly and without proper knowledge, as the application of medicines does not entail one-to-one correspondence (BS 5:22). \" It seems to refer to the principle of prescription, which requires appropriate knowledge about the unbalanced nature of medicines. ^ (to attain the middling-physician by not using medicines). 1 / 1 1 1 In the lunar calendar, spring refers to February, March, and April, and winter to November, December, and January. \" Byoka suchi uses \"good ki (^iM literally vital ki or ^ pure ki)\" which simply indicates clean ki haled from the outside world. The author makes a contrast with muddy or turbid ki referring to ki that has become unclean due to having been used in the body or shut up in a closed area. On the other hand some of the Chinese ycmgsheng texts specify live qi ^E.%, which stands in contrast with dead qi H fcM , depending on the time of a day. For instance Baopuzi claims that from 12 o ' clock midnight till noon is the time of live qi, while from noon till midnight is the time of dead qi, thus one is advised to practise qi exercise during the time of live qi.

During the Edo period, men of samurai status were officially permitted to take \"nursing-leave (kango kotowari ^ll|l\u00aer)\" from their duty in time of illness in the family. This permission also extended to relatives such as brothers, sisters, and aunts and uncles. At first, leave was often 340 limited to cases of smallpox, measles, and chickenpox, in order to prevent infection; however it was later extended to serious illnesses in general, in the name of filial piety. The leave typically lasted from ten to fifteen days. Yanagiya Keiko 1996 'Kinsei 573, 60-77. X V 1 Koto a traditional stringed musical instrument from China.

Dan, Duke of Zhou (Zhou Gongdan J ijB \u00a3 r J = L , 1 l-10th century BCE) was the son of King Wen 3C3E, the founder of the Zhou dynasty (around 1047-771 BCE). It is said that Zhou Gongdan was a man of virtue and filial piety, and performed great services in assisting his father and brother, the succeeding King Wu.

He is said to have had a charismatic character and contributed to Mongolian expansion, but to have ruined his health in his later years due to alcoholism. ^ In February of the 13th year of Emperor Taizong (1241), the emperor became seriously ill, and his pulse had already ceased. When the empress consulted with Chucai about this, he answered that politics had recently become corrupt and many innocent people had been put in jail, so the emperor should enforce a grand amnesty. When the emperor temporarily recovered consciousness, this idea was relayed to him. He was still unable to speak, but nodded to show his agreement. That night the physician found that the emperor's pulse had revived again, and the following day the disease was cured.

Conclusion of Chapter 3 The third chapter is an attempt to translate the first fascicle of Byoka suchi, which concisely sets out the author's medical ethics, and approach to pathojogy and physiology. Due to limitations of length, it is impossible to show or discuss in detail all the furigana that appear in the text. Nonetheless, I hope to have demonstrated the intensive use of furigana and their effect, as it distinguishes Byoka suchi from many other yojo texts of the time. In principle I have translated the meaning of the furigana, considering that the use of furigana in Byoka suchi represents Hirano Jusei's effort to digest the foreignness of imported medical concepts that originally come from Chinese medical texts, and are mostly written in Chinese characters. In addition to the translation, I provide a meta-commentary as endnotes at the conclusion of each section, to show the deep knowledge of Chinese medical tradition and wide-ranging intellectual background of the author. From the gaps and dislocations between Chinese characters and furigana , and a close examination of the author's arguments, we find that Hirano Jusei developed his own views of the body and illness, based on his knowledge of traditional medicine. The act of translating Byoka suchi is, therefore, a way of approaching the theme of the thesis: to shed light on a pattern of interpretation of Chinese medical knowledge by the author, a scholarly physician of the Edo-period Japan, addressed to lay readers. 342 Conclusion of the thesis In conclusion, this thesis has concerned itself with images and expressions of the body and illness in early nineteenth-century Japan, through the examination of the yojo text Byoka suchi (What a household with sick persons should know), written by Hirano Jusei (1832). The thesis aims at highlighting how traditional Chinese medicine was transmitted and interpreted in the Edo period, particularly focusing on the tangled relationship between Chinese tradition, Japanese scholarly doctors, and ordinary Japanese householders. This relationship is embodied in Byoka suchi : knowledge of Chinese tradition is reflected in the text itself, the author is a scholarly Japanese physician, and ordinary Japanese householders form the main target audience. Surveying a number of yojo texts and relevant scholarly research, Chapter 1 first elucidates how yojo culture in the Edo period deviated from Chinese tradition. Though cultivation of life culture can be traced back to China, it flourished in Edo-period Japan as a cultural and social phenomenon with certain unique features. Rather than pursuing longevity and immortality, the art of yojo was primarily concerned with \"how to live\" within the framework of feudal society in the Edo period. Furthermore, not only a restricted educated class, but also ordinary lay people came to be acknowledged as the readers of yoyo texts. The second chapter discusses images of the body and illnesses as reconstructed from the analysis of Byoka suchi. In many respects Byoka suchi epitomises the Edo-period view of the body, typified by emphasis on ki circulation and the significance of the abdomen. The concern with circulation is simultaneously intertwined with the fear of ki stagnation, which was thought to result in congealed 343 clumps in the abdomen, which caused various afflictions. It is possible to say that these views of body and illnesses are Japanese interpretation of the Chinese medical tradition. In Byoka suchi , these ideas are noticeable when investigating such key terms as karada (body), kokoro (mind), hara (abdomen), konare (digestion), and shaku (congealed clump). Furthermore the intensive exploitation of furigana , the various applications of water therapy, and the practical instructions on midwifery, all show the author's concern that the text should be used in the home rather than in a professional medical context. One of the distinguishing characteristics of Byoka suchi lies in its expressiveness, manifested in the unique usage of furigana \u2014 appended Japanese phonemic readings. Going beyond a mere pronunciation guide, furigana in Byoka suchi often function as an authorial gloss on medical terms, which are mostly written in Chinese characters and were originally foreign to Japan. The third chapter, therefore, is devoted to translating the first fascicle of Byoka suchi , with particular attention to the gaps between the meanings of the Chinese characters and the furigana. In the course of this endeavour, my examination has pivoted on the gap between Chinese medical tradition and Japanese interpretation, as the furigana device often shows the distance between popular Edo views of the body and illness and their Chinese counterparts through the eyes of the author. After the Meiji Restoration (1868), the status of traditional medicine waned as Western medicine began to prevail. However this does not mean that yojo culture had no enduring effect on medical concepts and practices in Japan. Many health manuals and texts of home medicine were published, in which yojo was sometimes replaced with the term \"eisei\", a translation of \"hygiene\". The popularity of these medical textbooks for lay readers may well have laid a foundation for the dissemination of 344 public health. It is also possible to attribute the supply and demand of medical knowledge to the influence of the yojo trend since pre-modem times. Furthermore furigana , as a tool of conceptual translation, played a notable role in the absorption of Western medical ideas into the Japanese vocabulary, as it had once doiie in the domestication of Chinese medieine.
