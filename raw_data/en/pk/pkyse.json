We strongly encourage you to buy a good knife, but if you don't take care of it, the quality and price won't matter. \"You're eventually going to have to sharpen the knife,\" says Dave Arnold, a former instructor at the late L'Academie de Cuisine culinary school, who runs Precision Knife Sharpening out of his home in Virginia. \"It doesn't matter what kind of knife it is.\" Here's what you need to know about sharpening and other ways you can ensure your knives will last for years to come. Understand how a knife works. Most knives are sharpened to an angle of 30 to 40 degrees, Arnold says, and over time and use, \"that very thin edge is going to take some damage\". The edge will begin to flatten to more of a round shape rather than a sharp, pointy angle. The edge can also bend or fold over - not something you'd be able to see with the naked eye. When you sharpen a knife, you are grinding away some of the metal to reintroduce the proper, sharp angle. Know how to recognise when your knife needs to be sharpened. The whole point of a sharp knife is to help you work efficiently, easily slicing through food without having to exert too much pressure. Dull knives can also cause accidents when they slip over rather than cut through food. Arnold suggests tomatoes, lemons, bell peppers and carrots as effective foods for testing whether your knife needs to be resharpened. Also, onions. It won't work for everyone since sensitivity to the tear-producing chemical varies, but Arnold says a dull knife is likely to break open more onion cells and release more juices than a sharp knife that creates a clean cut.

However, while we're busy filling our shopping trolleys with gluten-free goodness, we're also jamming it with junk food and alcohol, new research suggests Getty/iStock Food and drink news Growing list of Vegan celebs Making the switch to veganism is a major lifestyle choice, one that many claim can improve energy levels, lower the risk of cardiovascular disease and clear up any skin issues. Beyonc\u00e9, Natalie Portman and Jessica Chastain are among the growing list of Hollywood stars who have eschewed animal products from their diets in recent years. There's also been an increasing number of professional athletes who have gone vegan, such as boxing champions Mike Tyson and David Haye, thus debunking the myth that following a plant-based diet will leave you feeling weak and malnourished. AFP/Getty/NARAS/iHeartMedia Food and drink news McDonald's has announced the launch of a new vegan burger on its menu in Germany This will mark the first time the German franchise of the fast food chain has offered a vegan burger to its customers.

BCAA supplements are often consumed in the form of powder, which is then added to water to make a shake. Published in journal Nature Metabolism, the study found that while BCAAs help to build muscle, they can also negatively impact an individual's temperament, cause weight gain and lead to a shortened lifespan Getty Images/iStockphoto Food and drink news Britain consumes more chocolate than any other country Most people love chocolate but it turns out no one does more than the Brits - with the average Brit found to have consumed 8.4 kg of chocolate in 2017, according to new data. Chocolate consumption around the world is on the rise, according to Mintel Global New Products Database (GNPD), which found that in the past year alone, Easter chocolate production has risen by 23 per cent Food and drink news 'Easter eggs should be banned for children under four' Dr Becky Spelman, chief psychologist at Harley Street's Private Therapy Clinic, is calling for Easter eggs to be banned for consumption for children under the age of four, claiming that giving them the opportunity to binge on chocolate so young will give them an unhealthy relationship with food later on. \"This is a nightmare situation for parents of this generation as they have no idea how to teach their children to delay their response to cravings,\" she said, explaining that too many young kids binge on these chocolates because their parents don't know how to stop them. \"Once a child starts overeating behaviour at a young age it's very hard to turn things around for them in terms of food and their eating habits moving forward, leading to obesity from at very young age,\" she added PA Food and drink news Pineapple overtakes avocado as the UK's fastest-selling fruit According to Tesco, pineapple has overtaken avocado as the UK's fastest-selling fruit, with sales increasing by 15 per cent in 2017.

Cambridge PhD graduate-turned farmer, Adrian Izzard has used traditional growing techniques at Wild Country Organics to produce the colourful spuds, packed with healthy cell-protecting anthocyanin, which had previously disappeared from UK plates when post-war farmers were pushed towards higher-yielding varieties The cool-looking that involves seeing how well a knife cuts through paper can be a little iffy, too. Even a sharp - but not perfectly sharp - knife might struggle to cut the paper. Arnold also points out that the thickness of some paper products - printer paper, note pads, etc - can vary and give you inconclusive results. If he's going to do the paper test, he relies on something like newsprint or coupon inserts, which generally have a consistent makeup. If you're worried that getting your knives professionally sharpened is too expensive to justify, you can rest easy. Most professionals will charge less than $10 (\u00a37) to sharpen a standard chef's knife. Think about honing your knives. Even if you know to sharpen your knives, you may not be as familiar with the concept of honing. Honing does not sharpen the blade. Instead, Arnold says, it realigns the blade, correcting the bending or folding described above. Honing can be done on a steel that looks a bit like a dagger (see the photo at the top of the page). You'll often find them included in knife sets, but Arnold prefers the quality of steels you buy a la carte. He recommends a diamond-coated one from Messermeister, which costs around $30. Other types are available in the $15 range. To hone your blade, lightly run the edge of the knife at a 15- or 20-degree angle along the steel. Three times on each side of the blade should be sufficient, Arnold says. Ideally, you'd be doing this before (or after) every time you use your knife, but we're not idealists here. Let's get practical: even doing it every so often will help. If honing isn't something you're interested in, you won't necessarily ruin your knife; you'll just need to have it sharpened more often.

Hard surfaces can dull or even chip a knife. Wooden or plastic boards are good choices, Arnold says. And, when it comes to chopping boards, bigger is better. Clean them properly. Hand washing is the best way to clean your knives. Dishwashers can be especially hard on knife handles, causing them to discolour, crack or separate from the blade. The racks or utensil basket can damage the blades and vice versa, and fishing a knife out of the dishwasher isn't a recipe for safety, either. After you wash a knife - a sponge with warm water and soap will do - dry it thoroughly, and carefully, with a towel. Do not store it dirty or wet unless you want it to rust. Store them the right way. Protect the blade, protect yourself. Never should you leave a knife blade exposed in a way that could cause injury. I prefer plastic sheathes on knives so I can keep them in a drawer. Wooden blocks are acceptable, too, as are magnetic strips on the wall, so long as they're not within reach of curious children or in a place where people are prone to bumping into them. \u00a9 Washington Post "}
