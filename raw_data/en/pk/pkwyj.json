Abstract Background of the Study: Infertility is regarded as a major life crisis that has the potential to threaten the stability of individuals and relationships in a severe way. During recent years, the development and flourishment of assisted reproduction technique (ART) methods has made the parenting possible for a substantial number of infertile couples all over the world. Most researchers have paid attention to the fact that the sexual distress, depression, guilt, anxiety, frustration, emotional distress and marital problems are all associated with infertility. Yoga and meditation can help women in experiencing the challenges of infertility. Keywords: Infertility; Yoga; Stress; Depression; WomenAim of the Study: To assess the effectiveness of yoga therapy on stress and depression among women undergoing infertility treat- ment. Result: Majority of the patients were within the age group of 20-30yrs suffering from primary infertility. The study revealed a signifi - cant difference between stress (p = 0.01) in experimental (155.9 +/- 3.6) and control group (185.0 +/- 4.7) and depression (p = 0.05) in experimental (17.8 +/- 2.43) and control group (31.4 +/- 2.76). The study found a positive association between the levels of stress and depression on age and duration of infertility. Conclusion: The study concludes that yoga therapy is effective in reducing stress and depression among patients undergoing infer - tility treatment in various ART centers.Research Methodology: An experimental study was done on women undergoing infertility treatment in Bansal, Madhya Pradesh. Sixty patients were randomized into control and experimental groups. The patients were explained about study, after informed writ- ten consent, the tools measuring aggression and its correlates were administered. Tools: Demographic data sheet, Infertility characteristics, Fertility problem inventory and Becks depression scale were used for data collection. Ethical clearance was obtained from Ethics Committee, BMHRC. Yoga therapy was administered to the experimental group after both groups pre test.

This helps in sustaining the spirit of hope in this materialistic gen- eration. Motherhood is the language of love and a sense of belong - ingness to care, to live, to protect and to cherish each other. It's the biggest gift of womankind. It also talks of forgiveness, thanks, pain and disappointments. For every child the dearest person close to his/her heart is none other than mother.76Yoga Therapy on Stress and Depression among Women Undergoing Infertility Treatment Citation: Namitha Josy., et al. \"Yoga Therapy on Stress and Depression among Women Undergoing Infertility Treatment\". Acta Scientific Women's Health 3.6 (2021): 75-91.Infertility is the inability to conceive contributed by various fac- tors of both male and female origin. A study regarding the gender differences resulted that a third (30%) of the factor is caused by male while another third by the female (30%) and both together 17% of the cases. It's seen that the rate of infertility is increasing per year owing to the social and economic standards of the popu- lation across the globe. In a recent survey of family stressors, in- fertility has been ranked one among the greatest stressors along with divorce and death of the spouse. Many researchers have come forward with relation of infertility and grieving process. It's been described as a chronic sorrow in life. Infertility also encloses the concept of 'disenfranchised grief' without having a social recogni - tion. The stress and depression during infertility is triggered by various other factors like birth of others (friends or family mem- ber) children, the behaviour of the family members and other ma- jor life events. The couples taking treatment less than one year is more stress - ful and depressive than the people taking the treatment for more than 2 years. Studies suggest that maximum severity of depres - sion is seen in the third year of infertility treatment compared to couples suffering from infertility for a past duration of 6 years. The major period of stress and depression is between the 1st and 3rd year of infertility treatment. This period is also followed by anxiety, loss of self- confidence, loss of sexual pleasure and maladjustments thus severely decreasing the quality of life. ART methods and its flourishment have made fertility a possible option in recent years. Maximum couples are supported and assisted with these new methods overcoming all the problems like stress and depression. Most of the studies have shown improvement in total quality of life of the couples as a successful treatment outcome. The major ART methods used by the couples are ovulation induction, intra uterine insemination (IUI) and In vitro fertilisation (IVF). All of these meth- ods are stressful but maximum impact is seen in IVF. The cost of the treatments also add to the emotional level of the couples. In India CAM including all methods like homeopathy, herbal therapy and yoga are inseparable part of Indian health system from ages. Many recent studies have shown positive effects of yoga therapy in reducing stress and depression among infertile women. Researchers has included meditation and yoga especially 'hata' yoga as an adjuvant to the treatment given to the couple. Stud- ies result that most of the samples in experimental group with all these methods have shown an appreciable improvement compared to their counterpart. Various cognitive therapy and behavioural therapy has also shown such improvements. Majority got pregnant within a period of one year. Yoga helps in the relaxation of body, calm mind, reduces the symptoms like depression, stress, anxiety and improves the quality of life. It balances the whole person and maintains a healthy mind. However this scientific area need further researches and studies to support the same. In Indian settings this virgin field of research will explore a novel dimension of scientific nursing research. Materials and Methods The research approach used in the study is True Experimental. Experimental and control groups were identified, intervention was provided to the experimental group. Pre and post tests were col- lected from both the groups within specific period of time. Research design A pre-test- post-test control group design on the basis of per day randomization (out of the total eligible samples visited the hospital, lottery method was used to classify the group into ex - perimental and control) was chosen for this study. This design is concerned with examination of the effect of independent variable (yoga) on the dependent variable (stress and depression). This es - sentially consist of manipulation, control and randomization, the characteristics of a true experimental study.

Delimitation The study is delimited to the fertility clinic of Bansal hospital, Bhopal, Madhya Pradesh during the study period from April 2018 to June 2018. Research setting Department of reproductive medicine, Bansal hospital, Bhopal M.P was the platform of the study. The total number of pregnan- cies achieved per year in the hospital is 1155, with ART assistance number of patients delivered is - 1002. The number of patients de - livered by IVF is 12 and the number of pregnancies is 5. Overall rate of the Pregnancy is 41.66 (2015 Jan - 2016 Dec). In OPD days the outpatient/new cases per day is 25. Out of 25 new cases the maximum number of people who met the including criteria were approximately 15 - 10 per day. They were equally distributed ac- cording to the sampling/randomization into both the groups.78Yoga Therapy on Stress and Depression among Women Undergoing Infertility Treatment Citation: Namitha Josy., et al. \"Yoga Therapy on Stress and Depression among Women Undergoing Infertility Treatment\". Acta Scientific Women's Health 3.6 (2021): 75-91.Population Population of this study was the women, diagnosed with infer - tility, attending the infertility clinic and seeking technological assis - tance using ART methods for reproduction. The target population was all the women undergoing infertility treatment. The accessible population was the women undergoing treatment at Bansal hos - pital. Sample Among the females attending the clinic, the patients confirmed infertile by the diagnostic procedures were subjected to the inclu - sion criteria. The patients who met the inclusion criteria were cho - sen as the samples for the study. Inclusion criteria Women undergoing infertility treatment (Ovulation Induc- tion, Intrauterine Insemination and IVF) in Bansal Hospital, Bhopal. Who are willing to participate and willing to do yoga in the study. Women who are able to read and write Hindi or English. Exclusion criteria Were already exposed to relaxation techniques Had undergone counseling previously Had practiced yoga already Women who didn't understand Hindi/English. Sampling technique Sample in the present study were selected by probability sam- pling specifically simple random sampling technique (per day ran- domization). Per day 10 samples were recruited, 5 each in both the control and experimental groups. Per day randomization was done from the samples, who were willing to attend the class on Satur - days and were listed down on a sampling frame, lottery method was used to group them into two, control and experimental groups. The experimental group was provided with scheduled yoga classes every respective Saturdays. Sample size The total sample size was 60. The samples were randomly as- signed into 30 control group and 30 experimental group for the study purposes. Sample size was determined by appropriate re- view of the literature and power analysis was used for the calcula - tion of the sample size. The formula suggested was: Z = 2(Z + Z) 2 (P55+99) (P1 - P2) The determined sample size was around 32. The researcher has rounded it by 30. Data collection tools and techniques The structured questionnaire schedule consists of following sections Part-A: Demographic Performa Part-B: Infertility characteristics Part-C: Fertility problem inventory Part-D: Becks depression inventory. Part-A: Demographic performa This was a data sheet for recording the socio-demographic de - tails of each sample. The items included were age, religion, resi - dence, educational status of the women, occupation of the women, family income, and type of family. Part-B: Infertility characteristics Infertility characteristics included age at marriage, married years, history of infertility in years, years of infertility treatment, cause of infertility, no of IVF attempts and number of abortions. Part-C: Fertility problem inventory Dr. Christopher Newton designed Fertility problem inventory to measure the level of stress among the couples suffering from infertility. The scale addresses five major issues common in their life such as social concern, sexual concern, relationship concern, childfree lifestyle and need for parenthood. Interpretation of the score: Social Concern includes all the comments and questions the infertility patient is ought to face and feelings of being isolated from the community, from peers, family, finding social activi- ties very difficult to cope with.79Yoga Therapy on Stress and Depression among Women Undergoing Infertility Treatment Citation: Namitha Josy., et al. \"Yoga Therapy on Stress and Depression among Women Undergoing Infertility Treatment\". Acta Scientific Women's Health 3.6 (2021): 75-91. Sexual Concern includes loss of interest and pleasure in sexual relations or feelings of pressure due to the treatment related schedule sex and loss of sexual self-esteem individually. Relationship Concern includes problems in defining infertility or difficulty in accepting the differences on the basis of gender and concerns about the relationship future. Rejection of Childfree Lifestyle includes view on a child free life, and the dependence of happiness on the basis of the birth of the child and perceptional difference in role performance. Need For Parenthood include role as a parent, the parenting features, and life goal as a parent. Scoring This scale contains positively phrased items. They are first re keyed as following; (6=1,5=2, 4=3, 3=4, 2=5, 1=6). Items: 1, 2, 6, 10, 12, 13, 21, 25, 28, 29, 30, 31, 32, 33, 34, 35, 36. Global Stress/total stress level is calculated as the sum of all the questions. Interpretation of the score. Score Level <100 Low stress 100 - 140 Average stress 140 - 180 Moderate Stress 180- 220 Moderately high stress >220 Very High stress Table a High score Indicates that the individual is experiencing more psychological stress than the average individual in life. Part-D: Becks depression inventory Aaron T . Beck is the creator of The Beck Depression Inventory. This consists of 21 questions comprising of a self reporting inven- tory. It's a psychometric test used across the globe for measuring the level of depression. Every statement is given a number to the right. The total score is interpreted by summing the number right to each response by the sample. The maximum score a sample can obtain is sixty three while the lowest can be till zero. The further evaluation must be done according to the scoring table below. Total Score Levels of Depression 1-10 11-16 17-20 21-30 Over 30These ups and downs are considered normal Mild mood disturbance Borderline clinical depression Moderate depression Severe depression Table b Every statement is given a number to the right. The total score is interpreted by summing the number right to each response by the sample. The maximum score a sample can obtain is sixty three while the lowest can be till zero. Validity and reliability of research tool To meet the content validity experts were consulted from vari- ous fields and the language was analysed by language experts in Hindi. More than 10 experts did the content validity and 5 experts did the language validity. Necessary changes as mentioned by the experts were made in part A and B of the questionnaire. The demo - graphic variables and infertility characteristics were subjected to test retest method. The 'r' value obtained was 0.83 (positive corre- lation). The fertility problem inventory and becks depression scale reliability was established by the owners of the respective tools as the tools are already standardized. Ethical considerations The research proposal was submitted to the ethical committee of Bhopal Memorial Hospital and Research centre. Principal inves - tigator attended the committee meeting and permission was ob- tained from the same for a period of one year. Written consents were taken from the participants before starting the study. It was ensured by the researcher that the prescribed treatment and rou- tine care of patient will not be affected. Principal investigator as- sured the confidentiality. The final submission and conclusion were presented before the ethical committee.80Yoga Therapy on Stress and Depression among Women Undergoing Infertility Treatment Citation: Namitha Josy., et al. \"Yoga Therapy on Stress and Depression among Women Undergoing Infertility Treatment\". Acta Scientific Women's Health 3.6 (2021): 75-91.Pilot study To assess the feasibility of the study, a pilot study was conduct- ed. The study showed that stress (p = 0.05) and depression (p = 0.10) significantly reduced after the intervention in experimental group. Thus the study concluded that main study can be done on the topic and was feasible. After consulting guide necessary chang- es were made in the infertility characteristics and the study was progressed to the main study level. The samples selected in the pi- lot study were excluded in the main study. Data collection procedure The data was collected through questionnaire from women ap- proaching infertility clinic of Bansal hospital and meeting the cri - teria. Time period of experimentation: the time period was scheduled as Month: April-June (2018) Days: Three days per week. Outpatient department with new cases worked on three days Monday, Wednesday and Friday. These days were used to collect samples for the study. Yoga therapy section was Saturday. Every Saturdays other than second Saturdays the experimental group participated in the sessions. Researcher ensured that each participant re- ceived 5-6 session before the post test. Thus the minimum gap between the post and pre test was almost 2 months. Following steps were implemented Permission was sought from head of departments to carry out the study. The investigator assessed and screened the women attending the Infertility Clinic of Bansal. All women meeting the inclusion criteria were selected for the study. Subjects were informed of the purpose, objectives and ben- efits of the study. Written consents were obtained from subjects. Full autonomy was given to participate and withdraw at any time. The study subjects were randomly assigned to control and ex - perimental group using day randomization (lottery method). Subjects were asked about the willingness to participate in the yoga therapy section. From those who were willing mobile number was collected and informed them that we will follow up. (Follow up was done by the help of what's app group where everyone including the yoga instructor and principal investi- gator were included. Various motivational messages and post- ers were used to encourage the participants.) End of the day name of the participants from the sampling frame were noted down in chits and randomly they were sorted using lottery method into both the experimental and control groups. After selection of subjects, investigator collected the informa- tion regarding demographic data, infertility variables, fertil- ity problem inventory and becks depression scale. Pre -test was done in both experimental and control groups each with 30 samples. In experimental group intervention was provided and rein- forced every week for two months. Individual follow up was done daily basis by what's app messages and information. Post test was collected from both the group. Plan of yoga therapy section The entire section was planned and designed by the yoga in- structor certified in the area of expertise. The principal investiga- tor took a 3 months class under the yoga instructor to conduct the study and guide the samples. The whole class maximum of 60 minutes was divided into three main sections focusing on the three main elements of yoga therapy Meditation Pranayama Hatha yoga. Class pattern Class started with frequent recitation of 'ohm' as mantra (5min) Initial breathing exercises to increase the concentration and catch the diverted mind was used.(5 min) This was followed by hatha yoga sections and included the basic asanas (20 min).

Discussion Description of subjects The study was conducted on subjects within the age 20- 45 yrs or above. Maximum number of subjects in both the groups was be- tween the age group 20-30 yrs. Both the control and experimental group had 30 each participant. Hindu religion dominated in control and experimental groups by 20(66.6%) and 21(70%), then Mus- lims 8(26.6%), 7(23.3%) respectively and Christians 2(6.6) in both groups. As per residential area, 4(13.3%), 5(16.6%) were from ru- ral, 10(33.3%), 9(30%) from 7(23.3%) from semi rural sector and 10(33.3%), 9(30%) from semi urban area respec - tively in control and experimental group. The educational status of the patients shows that majority of them were graduated evident from 17(56.6%) in control group and 14(46.6%) in experimen- tal group. None of them just had a primary level of education. A good sum of the subjects were housewife's as seen by the status in control group 18(60%) and experimental group 17(56.6%). Least number were having a government job 2(6.6%) in control group and 4 (13.3%) in experimental group Maximum subjects were from a well to do family with family income more than 50,000 in control group 16(53.33%) and in experimental group 17(56.6%). Less than half of the group had an income within the range of 20,000-50,000 in control 12(40%) and experimental 10(33.3%) and the minority with income less than 20,000 in both the groups. As per the type of family, joint family dominated in both the groups with 17(56.6%) in control and 18(60%) in experimental group fol- lowed by nuclear family. Level of significance shows that both the groups are comparable. Description of infertility characteristics Age at the time of marriage was between 20 to 25 years for both groups with 24(80%) In control and 26(86.6%) in experimental group followed by the age group of 25-30 years. None of them were married before 20 yrs and after 30 yrs. Duration of infertil- ity was maximum less than 2 years 18(60% ) in control group and 19(63.3%) in experimental group. One third of the patients were between 2-5 years of duration 10(33.3%) in both the groups. Least fall into the more than 5years category 2(6.6%) in control and 1(3.3%) in experimental group. As per the type of infertility, all pa- tients were suffering from primary infertility in control and experi- mental groups (100%). Causes of infertility were multiple. Polycys- tic ovary was seen dominating other causes with 9(30%) in control and 11(36.6%) in experimental group and then the hormonal imbalances and endometriosis. A significant number felled in the category of others/idiopathic 13(43.3%) in control and 10(33.3%) in experimental group. In control group 10(33.3%) had undergone ovulation induction between 1-3 times and in experimental group 14(46.6%) had undergone the same for 1-3 times and 2(6.6) for 3-5 times. Intrauterine insemination was performed with 9(30%) in control group for 3-5 times and experimental group had 3(10%) for 1-3 times and 9(30%) for 3-5 times. Control group had 4(13.3%) were taking In vitro fertilization for 1-3 times whereas experimen- tal group had 5 (16.6%) who were taking the same treatment. Ma - jority didn't had a history of abortions 18(60%) in control group and 17(56.6%) in experimental group while a significant number had a history with 12(40%) and 13(43.3%) respectively.89Yoga Therapy on Stress and Depression among Women Undergoing Infertility Treatment Citation: Namitha Josy., et al. \"Yoga Therapy on Stress and Depression among Women Undergoing Infertility Treatment\". Acta Scientific Women's Health 3.6 (2021): 75-91.Level of significance shows that both the groups are compa- rable. Description on stress, depression and yoga therapy The study used a combination of three branches of yoga in- cluding meditation, pranayama and hata yoga as a psychological adjuvant to women undergoing infertility treatment. In pre-test, the mean stress level of the subjects were 184.3 +/- 3.6 in control group, however in experimental group it was 184.2 +/- 4.4 which was significantly more or the same. Level of depression too showed the same with 30.3+/- 2.7in control group and 30.6 +/- 3.2 in ex - perimental group. The calculated 't' value was very less than the tabulate one thus was not significant at 0.05 level of significance. In post test, the level of stress without intervention (post-test) in control group was 185.0 +/- 4.7 while in experimental group af- ter intervention was 155.9 +/- 3.6 which was significantly lesser than the control group. Depression also had similar result with control group being 31.4 +/- 2.76 and experimental group 17.8 +/- 2.43 evident variations. The 'p' value of stress level was highly significant at 0.01 level of significance and the 'p' value of depres - sion was significant at a 0.05 level of significance, thus accepting the research hypothesis Major findings discussion In my study implementing yoga as an interventional method to reduce stress and depression, was found to reduce the same to an extent. This in compliance with the global studies like a random- ized study showed that mind body interventions was successful in improving the psychological well being of women undergoing in- fertility treatment. In a recent study implementing hatha yoga as an adjuvant therapy for the same group, similar results were reported. In the study it was found that a positive correlation was seen with age and level of stress and depression. The study results that as the age of the participants increased the stress and depression too increased positively. This is in agreement with most of the stud- ies. Study also found that a positive correlation was seen with du- ration of infertility and level of stress and depression. This result is in relation with the study of showing the parameters including anxiety increased with duration but a bit contradictory to the study of Sanders (2015) that the stress and depression increases till 1st 6 years of infertility and then decreases to a level less than that as the couple adapts to the situation of being infertile. Study included majority of the patients in the age group of 20- 30 years. Most belonged to Hindu religion, from different life set- tings. Among the cause of infertility Polycystic ovarian syndrome was seen as a major cause of infertility which is in relation to vari- ous studies like Lund suggesting PCOS as a leading cause of infertil- ity. Measures must be taken from the childhood to prevent PCOS by diet and lifestyle modifications. Major findings Majority of the patients were within the age group of 20 - 30 yrs. Hindu religion dominated among the subjects. Polycystic ovarian syndrome was found to be one of the leading causes of infertility. Yoga, as an interventional method proved to be effective in reducing the level of stress and depression. In the study a positive relation was seen between age and level of stress and depression. In the study a positive relation was seen between duration of infertility and level of stress and depression. Both the control and experimental groups were comparable in nature. Conclusion The study was conducted to following hypothesis: H0: There is no significant change in the level of stress and depression between pre and post yoga therapy among wom- en undergoing infertility treatment in experimental and con- trol group at 0.05 level of significance. The study found, majority of the patients were within the age group of 20 - 30 yrs. Hindu religion dominated among the subjects. Polycystic ovarian syndrome was found to be one of the leading causes of infertility. Yoga, as an interventional method proved to Bibliography 1.

In the study a positive relation was seen between duration of infertility and level of stress and depression. Both the control and experimental groups were comparable in nature. Re- jecting null hypothesis, the research hypothesis \"there is signifi - cant change in the level of stress and depression between pre and post yoga therapy among women undergoing infertility treatment in experimental and control group at 0.05 level of significance\" was accepted. Recommendations For further generalization the study must be done in large population The study can be done in pregnant women and the effects can be analysed. Other type of interventional methods like laughter yoga, hu- mour therapy, imagery, meditation and music therapy etc. can be used instead of yoga.
