That's okay. Now is the time to the get the facts. Getting back to the moments we miss starts with getting informed. It is up to you. How do COVID-19 vaccines protect us?Vaccines are the best protection we have against many serious illnesses. When we get a vaccine, it activates our immune response without the danger of an actual infection. This helps our bodies learn to fight off a virus. If we are exposed to the virus in the future, our immune system \"remembers\" how to fight it. Most vaccines for COVID-19 teach your body to protect against the harmless spike-shaped protein on the outside of the coronavirus (without using the virus at all). It's not possible to get COVID-19 from a vaccine. COVID-19 can have serious and life-threatening complications, which is why it's important for everyone who's eligible to get immunized as vaccines become available.COVID-19 VACCINE EDUCATION INITIATIVE2 updated 1/22/21COVID-19 FAQ s HISPANIC AUDIENCESHow are vaccines tested before I get them?Because vaccines are given to millions of healthy people to prevent serious diseases, they're held to very high standards. The FDA requires all vaccines to go through rigorous testing and inspection to ensure they are safe. This includes careful testing with thousands of people. The clinical studies to establish the safety and efficacy of the COVID-19 vaccines were as big and thorough as recent studies for other licensed vaccines. Researchers also made sure the trials included adults of diverse backgrounds, races, ethnicities, and underlying conditions. Both the FDA and the CDC have to ensure the safety and efficacy of the vaccines before they are recommended for use in the United States. Why should I get vaccinated?Getting immunized against COVID-19 will keep most people from getting sick. Even in a rare case where one does catch the virus, COVID-19 vaccines will likely prevent you from becoming seriously ill. Protecting yourself also helps protect the people around you, including those at increased risk of severe illness from COVID-19 or those who can't get vaccinated \u2014 like infants and children, or people with weakened immune systems. Getting immunized is important because COVID-19 can have serious and life-threatening complications.COVID-19 VACCINE EDUCATION INITIATIVE3 updated 1/22/21COVID-19 FAQ s HISPANIC AUDIENCESHow will most people feel after getting immunized against COVID-19?It's normal to experience some mild discomfort after getting a vaccine. This actually means it's working and that your body is creating a protective immune response - without the danger of getting COVID-19 or an actual infection. These types of signals may include soreness or some swelling in your arm. You may also feel tired, have a headache, fever, or chills. These symptoms do not mean you have COVID-19 \u2014 it's not possible to get COVID-19 from the vaccine. Ask your doctor if you have questions. Your body takes time to build immunity. You may not be fully protected against COVID-19 until 1-2 weeks after your second shot. Did clinical trials include people like me?Researchers made sure that the trials included adults of diverse backgrounds, races, ethnicities, and geographic areas. They collaborated with faith leaders, community organizations, and health clinics to reach volunteers from many different walks of life across the United States. Medical experts and doctors want to make sure the vaccines work safely and effectively for as many people as possible. People may respond differently to vaccines based on factors like age, gender, and health conditions \u2014 so it is important to have a diverse group of participants in clinical trials. COVID-19 has hit hard in the Black and Hispanic communities. Historically, these populations haven't always been included in clinical research, but with COVID-19 vaccines researchers made sure volunteers included people of color, as well as people over the age of 65 who are at higher risk of complications from the virus.COVID-19 VACCINE EDUCATION INITIATIVE4 updated 1/22/21COVID-19 FAQ s HISPANIC AUDIENCESHow much do they cost?There shouldn't be a cost to get vaccinated. Insurance providers will cover the cost of the vaccine, and the U.S. government has set up a system to cover costs for those who do not have insurance. Vaccine doses bought by the U.S. government will be given to the public for free, however, vaccination providers will be able to charge an administration fee for giving the shot to someone. Vaccine providers can get this fee reimbursed by the patient's public or private insurance company or, for uninsured patients, by the Health Resources and Services Administration's Provider Relief Fund. Do I still have to wear a mask?Yes. Until enough people are vaccinated, it's important to continue to wear a mask, stay 6 feet apart from people you don't live with, avoid crowds, and wash your hands frequently. Researchers are working to understand whether you can still carry the virus and spread it to others if you've had the vaccine and are protected from getting sick. Continuing to wear a mask helps protect others while we learn more about how COVID-19 spreads. It also helps protect people who are not able to get vaccinated \u2014 such as pregnant women or young children.COVID-19 VACCINE EDUCATION INITIATIVE5 updated 1/22/21COVID-19 FAQ s HISPANIC AUDIENCESHave more questions? GetVaccineAnswers.orgWhen can I get back to my life?We need to work together to get to the end of this pandemic. While trial data suggests authorized COVID-19 vaccines are highly effective, we will only manage the pandemic if enough people take them. Vaccine manufacturers are producing and distributing millions of doses of the vaccines, but they won't all be available at once. That's why certain high-risk groups are getting them first.

Until enough people have been immunized Vagainst COVID-19, we should continue wearing masks, staying 6 feet apart from people we don't live with, avoiding crowds, and washing our hands. "}
