A list of those health grounds can be found in section 212(a)(1) of the Immigration and Nationality Act. For more information on the validity of Form I-693, see the [USCIS Policy Manual Volume 8, Part B, Chapter 4.](https://www.uscis.gov/policy-manual/volume-8-part-b-chapter-4#S-C-4) Form Details 03/09/23. If the civil surgeon signs your form on or after May 31, 2023, you must use the 03/09/23 edition. You can find the edition date at the bottom of the page on the form and instructions. Dates are listed in mm/dd/yy format. If you complete and print this form to mail it, make sure that the form edition date and page numbers are visible at the bottom of all pages and that all pages are from the same form edition. If any of the form's pages are missing or are from a different form edition, we may reject your form. If you need help downloading and printing forms, read our [instructions](/downloading-and-printing-immigration-forms). After completing your immigration medical examination, the civil surgeon must give you, the applicant, the completed Form I-693 in a sealed envelope. Do not accept it if it is not in a sealed envelope. We will return the form to you if it is not in a sealed envelope, or if the envelope has been opened or altered. You (not the civil surgeon) must submit your Form I-693 to USCIS. If you are applying for adjustment of status, you may submit Form I-693: - By mail with your [Form I-485, Application to Register for Permanent Residence or Adjust Status](/i-485), to the location specified for your Form I-485 (see the [Direct Filing Addresses for Form I-485](/forms/all-forms/direct-filing-addresses-for-form-i-485-application-to-register-permanent-residence-or-adjust-status)); - By mail after filing your Form I-485 at the location specified in your most recent communication with us (for example, a Request for Evidence letter from us); or - In person at an interview in a USCIS field office (if an interview is required). Other applicants: Follow the instructions on or included with the application, or the instructions given to you by the office requesting the immigration medical examination. Save time by submitting Form I-693, Report of Immigration Medical Examination and Vaccination Record, with [Form I-485, Application to Register Permanent Residence or Adjust Status](/i-485). We generally consider a completed Form I-693 to retain its evidentiary value for 2 years after the date the civil surgeon signed it. We have removed the requirement that the applicant submit their underlying immigration benefit application no more than 60 days after the civil surgeon's signature on Form I-693. You are not required to submit your Form I-693 at the same time you file Form I-485. While some applicants intend to bring their completed Form I-693 to their interview, some applications may not require an interview. We make decisions to waive interviews on a case-by-case basis. Filing Form I-485 and Form I-693 at the same time may eliminate the need for us to issue a Request for Evidence (RFE) to obtain your Form I-693. This may also help avoid adjudication delays if we decide that you do not need to be interviewed. Fees for immigration medical examinations are established by the civil surgeon. Fees may vary by physician. Filing Tips: Go to our [Tips for Filing Forms by Mail](/forms/filing-guidance/tips-for-filing-forms-by-mail) page for information on how to help ensure we will accept your application. Don't forget to sign your form. We will reject any unsigned form. To ensure your immigration medical examination results are still valid when we adjudicate your associated benefit application, you should schedule the immigration medical examination as close as possible to the time you file for adjustment of status, respond to a Request for Evidence, or attend an interview (if applicable). Be sure to provide enough time for any laboratory testing or additional testing required under the Technical Instructions for Civil Surgeons from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.
