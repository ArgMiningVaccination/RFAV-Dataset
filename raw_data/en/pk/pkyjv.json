Field of Invention The present invention relates to formulations for inhibiting Cathepsin G, Cathepsin S, Cathepsin B, Cathepsin NF-kfi comprising processed Morinda citrifolia products and methods for administering such. 2. Background Aspartic peptidases have received enormous interest because of their significant roles in human diseases like involvement of renin in hypertension, cathepsin D in metasta\u00ad sis of breast cancer, -Secretase in Alzheimer's Disease, plas- mepsins in malaria, HIV-I in can\u00ad didal required for the rep\u00ad lication and further infection by the virus. Effort has taken place for several years to understand the properties of this enzyme, because it has potential as a drug target to control HIV-I. Elevated cathepsin enzyme activity in serum or the extra\u00ad cellular matrix is often related to a number of pathological conditions. Cathepsin-mediated diseases include: Alzhe- 50 imer's, numerous types of cancer, autoimmune related dis\u00ad eases like arthritis and the accelerated breakdown of bone structure seen with osteoporosis. Up-regulated cathepsin B and L activity has been linked to several types of cancer. These include cancer of the colon, pancreas, ovaries, breast, lung and skin (melanoma). Up-regulation of cathepsin K has been shown un lung tumors. Increased cathepsin K activity has also been linked to degenerative bone diseases including osteoporosis and post-menopausal osteoporosis. The cathepsins family contains members of the lysosomal 60 cysteine protease, members of G) and aspartic protease (cathepsin D, E). These enzymes exist in their processed form as disulfide-linked heavy and light chain subunits with molecular weights ranging from 20-35 kDa. Cathepsin C is the noted exception, existing as oligomeric enzyme with a MW -200 post-transitionally pro-2 cessed into their active configurations after passing through the endoplasmic reticulum and subsequent incorporation into the acidic environment of the lysosomes. In resting cells, cytoplasmic location of the nuclear tran- 5 scription factor NF-kB is bound by an inhibitory subunits IkB; binding of IkB effectively masks the nuclear localization sequences present on the P50 and P65 subunits of NF-kB, preventing nuclear translocation. It appears that upon cellular stimulation, a signal transduction pathway is activated lead\u00ad ing to phosphorylation of key serine residues in the IkB polypeptide whereupon the NF-kB-IkB complex dissociates, IkB is rapidly and the unmasked nuclear localiza\u00ad tion signal allows NF-kB to translocate into nucleus and activate the transcription of specific genes. It is known that NF-kB regulates many proinflammatory and prothrombic factors produced by activated leukocytes. NF-kB represents a master regulator of inflammation and is, therefore, an attrac\u00ad tive target for drug development. SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION Some embodiments relate to formulations for inhibiting Cathepsin G, Cathepsin S, Cathepsin B, Cathepsin L, and NF-kB comprising processed Morinda citrifolia products and methods for administering such. Some embodiments provide a method of treating various diseases and ailments, which comprise administering to said 30 mammal a processed Morinda citrifolia product selected from a group consisting of: extract from the leaves of Morinda citrifolia, leaf hot water extract, processed Morinda citrifolia leaf ethanol extract, processed Morinda citrifolia leaf steam distillation extract, Morinda citrifolia fruit juice, Morinda citrifolia seeds, seed extracts, extracts from Morinda citrifolia seeds and evaporated concentration of Morinda citrifolia fruit juice. The features and advantages may be realized and obtained by means of the instruments and combinations particularly 45 pointed out in the appended claims. Furthermore, the features and advantages of the invention may be learned by the prac\u00ad tice of the invention or will be obvious from the description, as set forth hereinafter.

DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION It will be readily understood that the components of the present invention, as generally described herein, could be arranged and designed in a wide variety of different configu\u00ad rations. Thus, the following more detailed description of embodiments of the compositions and methods of the present invention is not intended to limit the scope of the invention, as claimed, but is merely representative of the presently pre\u00ad ferred embodiments of the invention. The scope of the inven\u00ad tion is, therefore, indicated by the appended claims rather than by the foregoing description. AU changes that come within the meaning and range of equivalency of the claims are to be embraced within their scope. Embodiments of the present invention feature methods and compositions for inhibiting Cathepsin G, Cathepsin and to treat and prevent pathological conditions related to hypertension, metastasis of breast cancer, Alzheimer's Dis\u00ad ease, acquired immune deficiency syndrome, candidal infec\u00ad tions, numerous types of cancer, autoimmune related diseases like arthritis, accelerated breakdown of bone structure seen with osteoporosis, and inflammation. The foregoing list of ailments and diseases are mitigated, and the enzymatic inhi\u00ad bitions are fostered, through the administration of a compo\u00ad sition comprising a component derived from the Indian Mul\u00ad berry or Morinda citrifolia L. plant. General Description of the Morinda citrifolia L. Plant The Indian Mulberry or Morinda citrifolia plant, known scientifically as Morinda Citrifolia L. (\" Morinda citrifolia \"), is a shrub or small tree up to 10 m in height. The leaves are oppositely arranged with an elliptic to ovate form. The small white flowers are contained in a fleshy, globose, head like cluster. The fruits are laige, fleshy, and ovoid. At maturity, they are creamy white and edible, but have an unpleasant taste and odor. The plant is native to Southeast Asia and has spread in early times to a vast area from India to eastern Polynesia. It grows randomly in the wild, and it has been cultivated in plantations and small individual growing plots. The Morinda citrifolia flowers are small, white, three to five lobed, tubular, fragrant, and about 1.25 cm long. The flowers develop into compound fruits composed of many small drupes fused into an ovoid, ellipsoid or roundish, lumpy body, with waxy, white, or greenish-white or yellowish, semi-translucent skin. The fruit contains \"eyes\" on its surface, similar to a potato. The fruit is juicy, bitter, dull-yellow or yellowish-white, and contains numerous red-brown, hard, oblong-triangular, winged 2-celled stones, each containing four seeds. When fully ripe, the fruit has a pronounced odor like rancid cheese. Although the fruit has been eaten by several nationalities as food, the most common use of the Morinda citrifolia plant has traditionally been as a red and yellow dye source. Processing Morinda citrifolia Leaves The leaves of the Morinda citrifolia plant are one possible component of the Morinda citrifolia plant that may be present in some compositions of the present invention. For example,4 some compositions comprise leaf extract and/or leaf juice as described further herein. Some compositions comprise a leaf serum that is comprised of both leaf extract and fruit juice obtained from the Morinda citrifolia plant. Some composi- 5 tions of the present invention comprise leaf serum and/or various leaf extracts as incorporated into a nutraceutical prod\u00ad uct (\"nutraceutical\" herein referring to any drug or product designed to improve the health of living organisms such as human beings or mammals). In some embodiments of the present invention, the Morinda citrifolia leaf extracts are obtained using the follow\u00ad ing process. First, relatively dry leaves from the Morinda citrifolia L. plant are collected, cut into small pieces, and placed into a crushing device\u2014preferably a hydraulic 15 press\u2014where the leaf pieces are crushed. In some embodi\u00ad ments, the crushed leaf pieces are then percolated with an alcohol such as ethanol, methanol, ethyl acetate, or other alcohol-based derivatives using methods known in the art. Next, in some embodiments, the alcohol and all alcohol- 20 soluble ingredients are extracted from the crushed leaf pieces, leaving a leaf extract that is then reduced with heat to remove all the liquid therefrom. The resulting dry leaf extract will herein be referred to as the \"primary leaf extract.\" In some embodiments of the present invention, the primary 25 leaf extract is pasteurized to at least partially sterilize the extract and destroy objectionable organisms. The primary leaf extract is pasteurized preferably at a temperature ranging from 70 to 80 degrees Celsius and for a period of time suffi\u00ad cient to destroy any objectionable organisms without major 30 chemical alteration of the extract. Pasteurization may also be accomplished according to various radiation techniques or methods. In some embodiments of the present invention, the pasteur\u00ad ized primary leaf extract is placed into a centrifuge decanter 35 where it is centrifuged to remove or separate any remaining leaf juice therein from other materials, including chlorophyll. Once the centrifuge cycle is completed, the leaf extract is in a relatively purified state. This purified leaf extract is then pas\u00ad teurized again in a similar manner as discussed above to 40 obtain a purified primary leaf extract. Preferably, the primary leaf extract, whether pasteurized and/or purified, is further fractionated into two individual fractions: a dry hexane fraction, and an aqueous methanol fraction. This is accomplished preferably via a gas chromato- 45 graph containing silicon dioxide and CH2C12-MeOH ingre\u00ad dients using methods well known in the art. In some embodi\u00ad ments of the present invention, the methanol fraction is further fractionated to obtain secondary methanol fractions. In some embodiments, the hexane fraction is further fraction- 50 ated to obtain secondary hexane fractions. One or more of the leaf extracts, including the primary leaf extract, the hexane fraction, methanol fraction, or any of the secondary hexane or methanol fractions may be combined with the fruit juice of the fruit of the Morinda citrifolia plant 55 to obtain a leaf serum (the process of obtaining the fruit juice to be described further herein). In some embodiments, the leaf serum is packaged and frozen ready for shipment; in others, it is further incorporated into a nutraceutical product as explained herein. 60 Processing Morinda citrifolia Fruit Some embodiments of the present invention include a com\u00ad position comprising fruit juice of the Morinda citrifolia plant. Because the Morinda citrifolia fruit is for all practical pur\u00ad poses inedible, the fruit must be processed in order to make it 65 palatable for human consumption and included in the com\u00ad positions of the present invention. Processed Morinda citri\u00ad folia fruit juice can be prepared by separating seeds and peels US 8,574,642 B2 5 from the juice and pulp of a ripened Morinda citrifolia fruit; filtering the pulp from the juice; and packaging the juice. Alternatively, rather than packaging the juice, the juice can be immediately included as an ingredient in another product, frozen or pasteurized. In some embodiments of the present invention, the juice and pulp can be pureed into a homog\u00ad enous blend to be mixed with other ingredients. Other pro\u00ad cesses include freeze drying the fruit and juice. The fruit and juice can be reconstituted during production of the final juice product. Still other processes may include air drying the fruit 10 and juices prior to being masticated. In a currently preferred process of producing Morinda citrifolia fruit juice, the fruit is either hand picked or picked by mechanical equipment. The fruit can be harvested when it is at least one inch (2-3 cm) and up to 12 inches (24-36 cm) in diameter. The fruit preferably has a color ranging from a dark green through a yellow-green up to a white color, and grada\u00ad tions of color in between. The fruit is thoroughly cleaned after harvesting and before any processing occurs. The fruit is allowed to ripen or age from 0 to 14 days, but preferably for 2 to 3 days. The fruit is ripened or aged by being placed on equipment so that the fruit does not contact the ground. The fruit is preferably covered with a cloth or netting material during aging, but the fruit can be aged without being covered. When ready for further processing the fruit is light in color, such as a light green, light yellow, white or translucent color. The fruit is inspected for spoilage or for excessive green color and firmness. Spoiled and hard green fruit is separated from the acceptable fruit. The ripened and aged fruit is preferably placed in plastic lined containers for further processing and transport. The containers of aged fruit can be held from 0 to 30 days, but preferably the fruit containers are held for 7 to 14 days before processing. The containers can optionally be stored under refrigerated conditions priorto furtherprocessing. The fruit is unpacked from the storage containers and is processed through a manual or mechanical separator. The seeds and peel are separated from the juice and pulp. The juice and pulp can be packaged into containers for storage and transport. Alternatively, the juice and pulp can be immediately processed into a finished juice product. The containers can be stored in refrigerated, frozen, or room tem\u00ad perature conditions. Th e Morinda citrifolia juice and pulp are preferably blended in a homogenous blend, after which they may be mixed with other ingredients, such as flavorings, sweeteners, nutritional ingredients, botanicals, and colorings. The finished juice product is preferably heated and pasteur\u00ad ized at a minimum temperature of 181\u00b0 F. (83\u00b0 C.) or higher up to 212\u00b0 F. (100\u00b0 C.). Another product manufactured is Morinda citrifolia puree and puree juice, in either concentrate or diluted form. Puree is essentially the pulp separated from the seeds and is different than the fruit juice product described herein. The product is filled and sealed into a final container of plastic, glass, or another suitable material that can withstand the processing temperatures. The containers are maintained at the filling temperature or may be cooled rapidly and then placed in a shipping container. The shipping containers are preferably wrapped with a material and in a manner to main\u00ad tain or control the temperature of the product in the final containers. Thejuice and pulp may be further processed by separating the pulp from the juice through filtering equipment. The fil\u00ad tering equipment preferably consists of, but is not limited to, a centrifuge decanter, a screen filter with a size from I micron up to 2000 microns, more preferably less than 500 microns, a filter press, a reverse osmosis filtration device, and any other6 standard commercial filtration devices. The operating filter pressure preferably ranges from 0.1 psig up to about 1000 psig. The flow rate preferably ranges from 0.1 g.p.m. up to 1000 g.p.m., and more preferably between 5 and 50 g.p.m. 5 The wet pulp is washed and filtered at least once and up to 10 times to remove any juice from the pulp. The resulting pulp extract typically has a fiber content of 10 to 40 percent by weight. The resulting pulp extract is preferably pasteurized at a temperature of 181\u00b0 F. (83\u00b0 C.) minimum and then packed in drums for further processing or made into a high fiber product. Processing Morinda citrifolia Seeds Some Morinda citrifolia compositions of the present invention include seeds from the Morinda citrifolia plant. In 15 some embodiments of the present invention, Morinda citri\u00ad folia seeds are processed by pulverizing them into a seed powder in a laboratory mill. In some embodiments, the seed powder is left untreated. In some embodiments, the seed powder is further defatted by soaking and stirring the powder 20 in hexane\u2014preferably for I hour at room temperature (Drug: Flexane\u2014Ratio 1:10). The residue, in some embodiments, is then filtered under vacuum, defatted again (preferably for 30 minutes under the same conditions), and filtered under vacuum again. The powder may be kept overnight in a fume 25 hood in order to remove the residual hexane. Still further, in some embodiments of the present invention, the defatted and/or untreated powder is extracted, preferably with ethanol 50% (m/m) for 24 hours at room temperature at a drug solvent ratio of 1:2. 30 Processing Morinda citrifolia Oil Some embodiments of the present invention may comprise oil extracted from the Morinda Citrifolia plant. The method for extracting and processing the oil is described in U.S. patent application Ser. No. 09/384,785, filed onAug. 27,1999 35 andissuedasU.S.Pat.No.6,214,351 onApr. reference herein.
