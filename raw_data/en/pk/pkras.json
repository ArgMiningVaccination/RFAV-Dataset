Part of this comprehensive assessment work is to identify unmet health needs in the community. Community stakeholders then helped to prioritize the unmet needs for further implementation strategy development. We are grateful to all the community members who joined us in this important work. During December 2017 and January 2018 members of the community were asked to complete a survey to help identify unmet health needs. Researchers at the Center for Social Research at North Dakota State University analyzed the survey data. Pioneer Memorial Hospital and Health Services in partnership with Sanford Health, further analyzed the data, identified unmet needs, and collaborated with key community stakeholders to develop a list of resources and assets that were available to address each need. A gap analysis and prioritization exercise were also conducted to identify the most significant health needs and to further address these needs through the implementation strategies that are included in this document. Pioneer Memorial Hospital and Health Services has set strategy to address the following community health needs: Aging Population - Senior Care Education Mental Health - Education The report focuses on community assets as well as community health needs. The asset map/resource list is included in this document along with the action steps planned to address each identified need. At PMHHS, patient care extends beyond our bricks and mortar. As a not-for-profit organization, ensuring that the benefits of health care reach the broad needs of communities is at the core of who we are. Through our work with communities, we can bring health and healing to the people who live and work across our communities. Together, we can fulfill this mission. Sincerely, Thomas Richter Chief Executive Officer Community Memorial Hospital 4 Community Health Needs Assessment 2019 EXECUTIVE SUMMARY 5 Community Health Needs Assessment 2019 Purpose A community health needs assessment is critical to a vital Community Benefit program that builds on community assets, promotes collaboration, improves community health, and promotes innovation and research. A community health needs assessment helps the community build capacity to support policy, systems, environmental changes and community health improvement. A community health needs assessment also serves to validate progress made toward organizational strategies and provides further evidence for retaining not-for-profit status. The purpose of this community health needs assessment is to develop a global view of the population's health and the prevalence of disease and health issues within our community. Findings from the assessment serve as a catalyst to align expertise and to develop a Community Benefit plan of action. There is great intrinsic value in a community health needs assessment when it serves to validate, justify not-for-profit status and create opportunity to identify and address public health issues from a broad perspective. Study Design and Methodology The following report includes non-generalizable survey results from an online survey of community leaders and key stakeholders identified by Pioneer Memorial Hospital. This study was conducted through a partnership between the Community Health Collaborative and the Center for Social Research (CSR) at North Dakota State University. The CSR developed and maintained links to the online survey tool. Members of the Community Health Collaborative distributed the survey link via e-mail to stakeholders and key leaders, located within various agencies in the community, and asked them to complete the online survey. Therefore, it is important to note that the data in this report are not generalizable to the community. 1. Non-Generalizable Survey The Center for Social Research at North Dakota State University developed and maintained links to the online survey tool. NDSU distributed the website address for the survey instrument via e-mail to various key community stakeholders and agencies, at times using a snowball approach . 11 total respondents participated in the online survey during December 2017 and January 2018. The purpose of this non-generalizable survey of community stakeholders in the area to learn about the perceptions of area community leaders regarding community health, their personal health, preventive health, and the prevalence of disease. A Likert scale was developed to determine the respondent's highest concerns, with 1 as not at all 6 and 5 meaning a great deal. Needs ranking 3.5 and above were included as needs to be addressed and prioritized. Many of the identified needs ranking < 3.5 are being addressed by PMH and community partners; however, 3.5 and above was the focus for the purpose of the required prioritization. 2. Community Stakeholder Meeting Pioneer Memorial Hospital invited community stakeholders to a meeting to review the early findings from the survey and to discuss the top health issues or health-related issues facing the community. Community stakeholders helped to determine key priorities for the community. 3. Community Asset Mapping Upon review of the data and identifying the unmet needs from the various surveys and data sets, asset mapping was conducted. Researched was done on any unmet needs to determine what resources were available in the community to address those needs. Once gaps were determined, the community stakeholder group proceeded to the prioritization process, utilizing a multi-voting methodology to determine which top priorities would be developed into implementation strategies. 4. Secondary Research The secondary data includes Robert Wood Johnson County Health Rankings for Gregory County, and the Focus on South Dakota - A Picture of Health study conducted by the Helmsley Charitable Trust. Indicators reviewed for this assessment include population data, vital statistics, adult behavioral risk factors, crime, and child risk. Key Findings - Primary Research Key findings are based on the non-generalizable survey data, with indicators ranked on a 1-5 Likert scale, with 5 being of highest concern. Survey results ranking 3.5 or higher are considered to high- ranking concerns. 1. Economics: Employment options was the highest ranked economic concern at 3.73. Affordable housing and maintaining livable and energy-efficient homes were also top concerns at 3.55 and 3.5 respectively. 2. Children and Youth: Bullying ranks highest of the concerns for children and youth with a ranking of 3.5. Other top concerns were the cost (3.5) and availability (3.4) of quality child care. 3. Health Care and Wellness: Access to affordable health insurance was of highest concern to survey respondents at 3.89. Availability of mental health providers was another key concern ranking at 3.88. 4. Aging Population: At 4.10, the cost of Long-Term Care and the cost of Memory Care were the top concerns among survey respondents. Additionally, the availability of resources for family and friends caring for and helping to make decisions for elders ranked 3.7. 5. Mental Health/Behavioral Health : Survey respondents indicated that depression was the top mental health concern at 3.13. Alcohol use and abuse was also mentioned as a concern, ranking at 3.0. 7 Key Findings - Secondary Research Based on the 2019 County Health Rankings Health Outcomes Turner County National South Dakota Premature Death (years of life lost before age 75 per 100,000 population) 8,000 5,400 7,300 Poor or Fair Health 11% 12% 12% # unhealthy mental health days in the last 30 days 2.6 3.1 2.9 % live births with low birth weight (<2500g) 4% 6% 6% Health Factors Turner County National South Dakota % adults currently smoking 14% 14% 18% % adults considered obese (BMI > 30) 35% 26% 31% % adults or binge 20% # alcohol-impaired driving sexually transmitted infections 158.4 152.8 504 Teen birth rate (# of births per 1,000 female pop. 15-19) 9 14 28 % uninsured adults 9% 6% 10% Ratio of population to primary care Physicians 8,320:1 1,050:1 1,320:1 Ratio of population to mental health providers 8,320:1 310:1 590:1 Ratio of population to dentists 4,160:1 1,260:1 stays 11% 11% 16% Social associations (# membership associations per 10,000 people) 26.5 21.9 16.4 % children in single-parent households 25% 20% 31% Annual median household income $56,200 $67,100 $56,900 8 The following needs were brought forward for prioritization: Economics: Employment options, affordable housing and maintaining livable and energy-efficient homes. Children and Youth: Bullying and quality childcare (cost and availability). Health Care and Wellness: Access to affordable health insurance and availability of mental health providers. Aging Population: Cost of Long-Term Care and Memory Care. Mental Health: Depression and alcohol use and abuse. PMHHS, with the recommendations from community stakeholders, has determined the 2022-2022 implementation strategies for the following needs: Aging Population - Senior Care Education Mental Health - Education 9 Implementation Strategies Priority 1: Aging Population - Senior Care Education According to the U.S. Health and Human Services Administration on Aging, the cost of long-term care depends on the type and duration of care you need, the provider you use, and where you live. PMHHS providers and social workers work with seniors to help them access the care and resources needed. The facility has a directory of senior care resources available and the staff refers patients to area service providers and resources to ensure safe discharge and transition to appropriate levels of care. Pioneer Memorial Hospital and Health Services has set strategy to help educate the community on how to access more affordable senior care services. The primary goal of this work is to improve awareness of resources, assistance programs and strategies to make health, housing and personal care services more economically accessible. PMHHS will sponsor seminars and vendor fairs on a variety of senior care topics including estate planning for nursing home Medicaid eligibility, subsidies available for health insurance, and available in-home services and financial assistance programs. Additionally, low-cost lab tests (Direct Tests) and free or reduced-cost screenings will be offered as part of this effort to help seniors plan for and live healthy independent lives. Priority 2: Mental Health - Education Mental health includes emotional, psychological, and social well-being. It affects how people think, feel and act. It also helps determine how we handle stress, relate to others, and make choices. Mental health is important at every stage of life, from childhood and adolescence through adulthood. Many factors contribute to mental health problems, including: Biological factors, such as genes or brain chemistry Life experiences, such as trauma or abuse Family history of mental health problems Mental health problems are common but people with mental health problems can get better and many recover completely. PMHHS has prioritized mental/behavioral health as a top priority and has set strategy to ensure that community members experiencing depression, anxiety, post-traumatic stress or suicidal thoughts will learn how they can access treatment. PMHHS will create awareness throughout the community about mental health services, resources, and assistance programs through multiple means including news releases, newsletters, brochures, resource guides, social media, and the hospital web site. 10 Community Health Needs Assessment 2019 11 Table of Contents Page Purpose of the Community Health Needs Assessment 11 Acknowledgements 12 Description of Pioneer Memorial Hospital and Health Services 13 Description of the Community Served - Viborg, South Dakota 13 Study Design and Methodology 14 Limitations of the Study 15 Key Findings 16 Community Health Concerns Personal Health Concerns Demographics Health Needs and Community Resources Identified Prioritization How Community Memorial Hospital is Addressing the Needs 30 2020-2022 Implementation Strategies 31 2016 Implementation Strategies Impact 34 Community Feedback from 2016 Community Health Needs Assessment 36 Appendix 37 Primary Research Asset Map Prioritization Worksheet Non-Generalizable Survey 38 Secondary Research Definitions of Key Indicators County Health Rankings o Turner County, South Dakota Helmsley Charitable Trust - SD Health Study - Turner County 150 12 Purpose of the Community Health Needs Assessment A community health needs assessment is an important part of a vital Community Benefit Program that builds on community assets, promotes collaboration, improves community health, and promotes innovation and research.

Pioneer Memorial Hospital is a 12-bed, critical access acute and swing bed care, community non-profit hospital that serves the residents of Turner County and the surrounding area. PMHHS also includes Viborg Medical Clinic, Centerville Medical Clinic, and Parker Medical Clinic, all certified rural health clinics, a 52-bed skilled nursing facility, 10-unit assisted living facility, and 20-unit independent living facility. Pioneer Memorial has two physicians and four advanced practice providers on staff and several outreach specialists who travel to Viborg to serve local patients and residents. The hospital's mission - \"Committed to health, healing and community\" - is complementary to its values of compassion, safety, quality of care, and fiscal responsibility as it aims to be a proactive force in the community to changing needs. Pioneer Memorial is governed by a nine-member Board of Directors. Description of the Community Served The town of Viborg, population 782, is located in the southeastern corner of South Dakota. Residents and visitors to Viborg enjoy stunning landscapes, local eateries, and movies at the Lund Theater. Several state parks are close by including Lewis and Clark Recreation Area, Newton Hills State Park, and Union Grove State Park. 15 Study Design and Methodology Primary Research Key Stakeholder Survey - A non-generalizable online survey was conducted by Pioneer Memorial Hospital with the assistance Sanford Health, public health leadership, and the Center for Social Research (CSR) at North Dakota State University. The CSR developed and maintained links to the online survey tool. The website address for the survey instrument was distributed via e-mail to community stakeholders and various agencies, at times using a snowball approach. Data collection occurred throughout December 2017 and January 2018 with a total of 11 respondents participated in the online survey. The purpose of this non-generalizable survey of community members and key stakeholders in the greater Burke area was to learn about the perceptions of area community leaders regarding community health, their personal health, preventive health, and the prevalence of disease. This group included community leaders and agency leaders representing chronic disease and disparity. A Likert scale was developed to determine the respondent's highest concerns. Needs ranking 3.5 and above were included in the needs to be addressed and prioritized. As stated in the generalizable survey methodology, many of the identified needs that ranked below 3.5 are being addressed by Pioneer Memorial Hospital. However, 3.5 and above was used as a focus for the purpose of the required prioritization. Resident Survey - The resident survey included questions about the respondent's personal health. An online survey was developed in partnership with public health experts from across the Sanford footprint. The Minnesota Health Department reviewed and advised Sanford about key questions that they request of the Statewide Health Improvement Partnership (SHIP) surveys and those questions were included in the resident survey. Questions specific to American Indian residents were developed by the North Dakota Public Health Association. The survey was posted on Facebook and a notice was posted in the local newspaper to invite residents to take the survey. The newspaper post included a URL for the survey. A total of 78 community residents participated in the survey. Community Asset Mapping - Asset mapping was conducted to find the community resources available to address the assessed needs. Each unmet need was researched to determine what resources were available to address the needs. Once gaps were determined, the prioritization exercise followed with key stakeholder groups determining the top needs. Community Stakeholder Discussions - Community stakeholders were invited to attend a presentation of the findings of the CHNA research. Facilitated discussion commenced and each participant was asked to consider his or her top two or three priorities that should be further developed into implementation strategies. The meeting served to inform the group of the findings but also served as a catalyst to drive collaboration. Prioritization Process - The primary and secondary research data was analyzed to develop the top unmet needs. The analyzed list of needs was developed into a worksheet. A multi-voting methodology from the American Society for Quality was implemented to determine what top priorities would be further developed into implementation strategies. Key community stakeholders met with medical center leaders to complete the multi-voting exercise. Secondary Research The secondary data includes the 2019 County Health Rankings as well as the Focus on South Dakota - A Picture of Health study for Turner County. 16 Limitations of the Study The findings in this study provide a limited snapshot of behaviors, attitudes, and perceptions of residents living in Viborg. A good faith effort was made to secure input from a broad base of the community. Invitations were extended to county and city leadership, local legislators, organizations and agencies representing diverse populations and disparities. The Internal Revenue Code 501 (r) statute requires that a broad base of key community stakeholders have input into the needs of the community. Those community members specified in the statute include: persons who represent the broad interests of the community served by the hospital facility including those with special expertise in public health; Federal, tribal, regional, state and or local health or other departments or agencies with information relevant to the health needs of the community served; leaders, representatives, or members of medically underserved, low-income, and minority populations. PMHHS extended a good faith effort to engage all of the aforementioned community representatives in the survey process. In some cases there were surveys that were submitted without names or without a specified area of expertise or affiliation. We worked closely with public health experts throughout the assessment process. Public comments and response to the community health needs assessment and the implementation strategies are welcome on the PMHHS website using the \"contact us\" information. 17 Key Findings 18 Community Health Concerns Economics The availability of employment options is of high concern for the respondents of the survey. Other concerns included availability of affordable housing and maintaining livable and energy efficient homes. Level of concern with statements about the community regarding ECONOMICS (1=no attention needed; 5=critical attention needed) Children and Youth The highest concern regarding children and youth is bullying. Cost and availability of quality childcare were other top concerns mentioned. Level of concern with statements about the community regarding CHILDREN AND YOUTH (1=no attention needed; 5=critical attention needed) 19 Health Care and Wellness Access to affordable health insurance coverage was the top concern among survey respondents. County Health Rankings for Turner County finds that 9% of the population is uninsured. Other concerns included availability of mental health providers and behavioral health providers. Level of concern with statements about the community regarding HEALTH CARE AND WELLNESS (1=no attention needed; 5=critical attention needed) Aging Population Survey respondents have a high concern about the cost of long-term care and memory care. Respondents also indicated concern about availability of resources for caring for elders, cost of in-home services for the elderly, and help making out a will or healthcare directive. Level of concern with statements about the community regarding THE AGING POPULATION (1=no attention needed; 5=critical attention needed) 20 Safety While respondents shared a variety of safety concerns, no individual item ranked greater than 3.0 on the scale. Top concerns that surfaced include abuse of prescription drugs, availability of emergency services, and the presence of drug dealers and street drugs in the community. County Health Rankings for Turner County finds that 33% of driving deaths involve alcohol impairment and that 18% of county residents report binge drinking or heavy drinking. Level of concern with statements about the community regarding SAFETY (1=no attention needed; 5=critical attention needed) Mental Health and Substance Use Depression was the highest ranked mental health concern among survey respondents. Alcohol and drug use and abuse for the general adult population were also concerns. Secondary data indicates that 35.6% of county residents have abused alcohol. Level of concern with statements about the community regarding MENTAL HEALTH AND SUBSTANCE USE 1=no attention needed; 5=critical attention needed) 21 Personal Health Concerns Respondents' Personal Health Status The study results suggest possible discrepancies between respondents' perceived personal health and their actual health status as determined by objective measures. For example, using the Body Mass Index (BMI), which calculates weight status using an individual's weight and height, 69% of respondents reported themselves as overweight or obese. However, the vast majority (98%) of community respondents rate their own health as excellent, very good, or good. Respondents' rating of their health in general: Respondents' weight status based on the Body Mass Index (BMI) scale: 22 Obesity is a common but serious disease. Obesity can have adverse effects on health and lead to a reduced life expectancy. Adults with a BMI > 25 are overweight and adults with a BMI > 30 are obese. According to the CDC, obesity and being overweight are the second leading cause of preventable deaths, tagging close behind tobacco use. Health conditions related to obesity: Coronary heart disease Type 2 diabetes Cancers ( endometrial, breast, and colon) Hypertension Dyslipidemia Stroke Liver and gallbladder disease Sleep apnea and respiratory problems Osteoarthritis Gynecological problems Nationally, approximately 39% of adults are obese. For more information on BMI, visit the Center for Diseases Control and Prevention: www.cdc.gov/healthyweight/assessing/bmi/ Length of time since respondents last visited a doctor or health care provider for a routine physical exam: Within the past year, 75% visited a doctor or health care provider for a routine physical. Respondents indicated that the main barriers to a routine check-up were cost, no need to be seen, transportation issues, inconvenient appointment times, and fear. Preventive Health Preventive health care promotes the detection and prevention of illness and disease and is another important component of good health and well-being. Community results indicate that within the past year, the majority of respondents had a blood pressure, blood sugar, cholesterol screening, dental screening, flu shot, pelvic exam (females), and breast cancer screening (females). However there are many screenings and tests that a majority of respondents did not receive (i.e. bone density test, cardio screening, glaucoma screening, hearing screening, immunizations, STD test, colorectal screening, prostate cancer screening {males}, and skin cancer screening) in the past year. Many tests and screenings may be conditional upon guidelines, which can be age sensitive/appropriate. 23 Whether or not respondents have had preventive screenings in the past year, by type of screening Of respondents who have not had preventative screenings in the past year, reasons indicated include cost (30%), haven't had time (21%), fear of screening or procedure (8%), doctor has not suggested the screening (8%), fear of results (5%), and unable to access care (4%). *Percentages do not total 100.0 due to multiple responses. Screenings Breast cancer screening : According to the Center for Disease Control (CDC), a mammogram is an X-ray of the breast. Mammograms are the best way to find breast cancer early, when it is easier to treat and before it is big enough to feel or cause symptoms. Having regular mammograms can lower the risk of dying from breast cancer. The United States Preventive Services Task Force recommends that if you are 50 to 74 years old, be sure to have a screening mammogram every two years. If you are 40 to 49 years old, talk to your doctor about when to start and how often to get a screening mammogram. Cervical cancer screening : Cervical cancer is the easiest gynecologic cancer to prevent, with regular screening tests and follow-up. Two screening tests can help prevent cervical cancer or find it early: o The Pap test (or Pap smear) looks for pre-cancers, cell changes on the cervix that might become cervical cancer if they are not treated appropriately. The Pap test is recommended for all women between the ages of 21 and 65 years old, and can be done in a doctor's office or clinic. o The HPV test looks for the virus that can cause these cell changes (human papillomavirus) (http://www.cdc.gov/cancer/hpv/basic_info/) Colorectal cancer screening : Colorectal cancer almost always develops from precancerous polyps (abnormal growths) in the colon or rectum. Screening tests can also find colorectal cancer early, when 24 treatment works best. Regular screening, beginning at age 50, is the key to preventing colorectal cancer. The U.S. Preventive Services Task Force (USPSTF) recommends screening for colorectal cancer using high-sensitivity fecal occult blood testing, sigmoidoscopy, or colonoscopy beginning at age 50 and continuing until age 75. Prostate cancer screening : The American Cancer Society (ACS) recommends that men have a chance to make an informed decision with their health care provider about whether to be screened for prostate cancer. The decision should be made after getting information about the uncertainties, risks, and potential benefits of prostate cancer screening. Men should not be screened unless they have received this information. The discussion about screening should take place at: o Age 50 for men who are at average risk of prostate cancer and are expected to live at least 10 more years. o Age 45 for men at high risk of developing prostate cancer. This includes African Americans and men who have a first-degree relative (father, brother or son) diagnosed with prostate cancer at an early age (younger than age 65). o Age 40 for men at even higher risk (those with more than one first-degree relative who had prostate cancer at an early age). After this discussion, those men who want to be screened should be tested with the prostatespecific antigen (PSA) blood test. The digital rectal exam (DRE) may also be done as a part of screening. If, after this discussion, a man is unable to decide if testing is right for him, the screening decision can be made by the health care provider, who should take into account the patient's general health preferences and values. Assuming no prostate cancer is found as a result of screening, the time between future screenings depends on the results of the PSA blood test: Men who choose to be tested who have a PSA of less than 2.5 ng/mL may only need to be retested every 2 years. Screening should be done yearly for men whose PSA level is 2.5 ng/mL or higher. Because prostate cancer often grows slowly, men without symptoms of prostate cancer who do not have a 10-year life expectancy should not be offered testing since they are not likely to benefit. Overall health status, and not age alone, is important when making decisions about screening. Even after a decision about testing has been made, the discussion about the pros and cons of testing should be repeated as new information about the benefits and risks of testing becomes available. Further discussions are also needed to take into account changes in the patient's health, values and preferences. Skin cancer screening : The U.S. Preventive Services Task Force (USPSTF) has concluded there is not enough evidence to recommend for or against routine screening (total body examination by a doctor) to find skin cancers early. The USPSTF recommends that doctors: 1) Be aware that fair-skinned men and women aged 65 and older, and people with atypical moles or more than 50 moles, are at greater risk for melanoma; 2) Look for skin abnormalities when performing physical examinations for other reasons. Flu Vaccines The Center for Disease Control's Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices (ACIP) recommends that everyone six months and older receive a flu vaccine annually. Findings from the survey indicate that 26% of respondents did not have a flu shot last year. The Center for Disease Control states that influenza is a serious disease that can lead to hospitalization and sometimes death. Even healthy people can get sick from the flu 25 and spread it to others. Flu vaccines cause antibodies to develop in the body about two weeks after vaccination. These antibodies provide protection against infection with the viruses that are in the vaccine. Physical Activity Levels Study results suggest that the majority of respondents do not meet physical activity guidelines. 42% of survey respondents reported three or fewer days of vigorous activity and 44% reported three or fewer days of moderate activity. Guidelines from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention recommend that individuals participate in 150 minutes of moderate physical activity per week or 75 minutes of vigorous physical activity per week to help sustain and improve health. Number of days in an average week respondents engage in MODERATE and VIGOROUS activity Tobacco Use Study results indicate that the vast majority of community respondents are not currently tobacco users with 67% indicating they do not use any form of tobacco. Additionally, 72% of self-identified smokers who responded to the survey have tried to quit in the past 12 months. Secondary research through the 2019 County Health Rankings finds that 14% of Turner County residents are current smokers, which aligns with the U.S. average of 14%. How often respondents currently smoke cigarettes or e-cigarettes and use chewing tobacco or snuff 26 Mental Health Mental health is an important component of well-being at every stage of life and impacts how we think, act and feel. Mental health influences our physical health, how we handle stress, how we make choices, and how we relate to others around us. Among Turner County respondents, mental health is a moderately high area of concern. Percentage of respondents who have felt down, depressed, hopeless, or had little interest or pleasure in doing things several days or more over the past two weeks: Substance Abuse Responses Substance abuse is also a mental health disorder, as defined by the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders , 4th edition (DSM-IV), and can stem from mental health concerns. In the Viborg community, 91% of survey respondents drank alcoholic beverages during the previous month. 31% of survey respondents report that alcohol has had a harmful effect on themselves or on a family member in the past two years and 24% indicate that a family member or friend has suggested they get help for substance use. 27 Additionally, 31% of respondents report binge drinking which is defined by the CDC as 4 drinks for females and 5 drinks for makes on the same occasion. Frequency of binge drinking in the past 30 days: Secondary research through the 2015 County Health Ranking s indicates that 18% of Turner County residents report excessive drinking. (See Appendix). Number of days with at least one drink in the past month: 28 Whether alcohol use or prescription or non-prescription drug abuse has had harmful effects on respondents or a family member over the past two years 29 Demographics General Population Data Turner County Total population 8,347 Median age 43.7 Median household incom e $54,294 % living below poverty level 10.6% Unemployment rate 3.2% % high school graduate or higher 92.9% Source: 2017 United States Census Bureau - www.census.gov Survey Respondents Of the respondents, 25% were female and 75% were male.

Asset mapping was conducted by reviewing the primary and secondary research and identifying the unmet needs from the various surveys and data sets. Each unmet need was researched to determine what resources were available in the community to address the needs. The community stakeholders participated in the asset mapping and reviewed the research findings. The group conducted an informal gap analysis to determine what needs remained after resources were thoroughly researched. Once gaps were determined, the group proceeded to the prioritization process. Top priorities, for further development into implementation strategies, were determined via the multi-voting methodology. The McKnight Foundation Model - Mapping Community Capacity by John L. McKnight and John P. Kretzmann, Institute for Policy Research at Northwestern University was the process implemented for this work The asset map includes identified needs from the following: Identified needs from the non-generalizable survey Community stakeholders review and further development Secondary research data Community resources that are available to address the need(s) The Asset Map can be found in the Appendix Prioritization The following needs were brought forward for prioritization: Economics - employment options and affordable housing Children and Youth - bullying and cost/availability of child care Health Care and Wellness - access to affordable health insurance and availability of mental health providers Aging Population - cost of long-term are and memory care and availability of resources for caring for elders Mental Health - depression and alcohol use and abuse PMHHS is addressing all of the assessed needs that fall within our scope of work. In some cases the need is one where we do not have the expertise to adequately address the need; however, PMHHS leaders will communicate these findings with community leaders and experts who can best focus on solutions to the concerns. A document that shares what PMHHS is doing to address the need or explains why PMHHS is not addressing the need can be found in the Appendix. PMHHS has determined the 2020-2022 implementation strategies for the following needs: Aging Population - Senior Care Education Mental Health - Education 31 Addressing the Needs Identified Concerns How Pioneer Memorial i s addressing the needs Economic Well -Being Employment options Affordable housing availability Maintaining livable and energy efficient homes Pioneer Memorial will address this need by sharing the findings with the Viborg Economic Development Committee and Viborg City Council. Children and Youth Bullying Cost and availability of child care Pioneer Memorial will address this need by sharing the findings of the CHNA with school leaders and community leaders. Healthcare and Wellness Access to affordable health insurance Availability of mental health providers Pioneer Memorial will address this need by sharing the findings of the CHNA with law enforcement, primary care providers and community leaders. Aging Cost of long-term care Cost of memory care Availability of resources for caregivers and decision-makers for elders Help making out a will or health care directive This need will be addressed by improving awareness of resources, assistance programs and strategies to make health, housing and personal care services more economically accessible. Pioneer Memorial will sponsor seminars on a variety of related topics along with low cost lab tests and free or reduced-cost screenings. Mental Health Depression Alcohol use and abuse Pioneer Memorial will create aware ness around mental health services, resources, and assistance programs by providing information through news releases, newsletters, social media, resource guides, and the PMHHS website. Pioneer Memorial will address alcohol use and abuse by sharing the findings of the CHNA with primary care providers in the service area. 32 2020-2022 Implementation Strategies 33 Implementation Strategy 2020-2022 Action Plan Priority 1: Senior Care Education Projected Impact: Seniors age 65 and older and their family/caregiver will learn how to access more affordable health care services.

The following strategies were implemented. Concerns Identified 2017-2019 Implementation Strategies Physical Health Implement Sanford fit program in local schools Implement Bountiful Basket program in Viborg Provide nutrition education and cooking classes Expand 'Biggest Loser Challenge' to communities in service area Develop walking programs for community members Encourage age appropriate colonoscopies Promote the American Cancer Society recommendation for skin cancer screens Mental Health / Behavioral Health Utilize Sanford MyChart capabilities for depression assessment Reduce dependence on opioid drugs These strategies have served a broad reach across our community and region. The impact has been positive and the work will continue into the future through new or continued programming and services. Impact of the Strategy to Improve Nutrition, Physical Health, and Obesity Rates in the Community 1. The Sanford fit kids program was distributed in October 2017 to the following schools: Viborg-Hurley, Centerville, Parker, and Irene-Waconia. There were no additional schools in 2018. 2. The Bountiful Basket program was discontinued in our service area. We are evaluating other options for this service. In 2018, the Cameron Colony provided a farmers market with seasonal fruits and vegetables to the Viborg Community. 3. Pioneer Memorial Hospital provided the following nutrition education and cooking classes in 2018: A) Slide and Dice - hands-on demonstration on proper techniques on slicing and dicing vegetables and fruit. B) \"Are Food Labels Confusing\" presented by Charlotte Rommereim, RD. C) \"Facts About How Your Food Supply is Raised\" presented by Charlotte Rommereim, RD. D) Deb Hauger, Public Health Nurse, presented on the following topics: Healthy vs. Unhealthy Drinks; Sugar & Dental; Food Safety, Eat the Rainbow Healthy Kids, Feeding Healthy Children, Eat Fruits & Vegetables; Recipe Ideas for In-Season Fruits & Vegetables; Salmonella Outbreak - Food Safety; Pre-Diabetes & Controlling Diabetes, and Nutrition to 2nd & 3rd Classes. 4. The \"Biggest Loser Challenge\" was expanded to all the communities in our service area. There were 73 participants in 2018 and 38 in 2017. 5. A Community Walking Program was developed in 2018 with 60 participants. The program promoted walking your way to better health and connecting with friends. The program ran from June 1 to July 31. 6. Pioneer Memorial Hospital & Health Services hosted the Danish Days 5K Run and 1-Mile Walk in 2017 and 2018. In 2018, there were 88 walkers and 27 runners. The event will again be hosted in 2019. 7. The Rehab Wellness Program meets 3 days / week with an average of 8-9 participants. The Community Wellness Center is operated by Pioneer Memorial. 8. Sanford Heart Screenings were offered during Danish Days in July 2018 to promote healthy hearts and identify individuals at risk for heart disease. 37 9. Providers continued to encourage patients to have age-appropriate colonoscopies during the patient's office visit. The baseline colonoscopies in 2016 were 40, and 30 colonoscopies were performed in 2017. In 2018, there were 38 colonoscopies performed. 10. Skin Cancer Screenings were not held in 2018, but will be offered again in 2019. Skin Cancer Screenings were held in 2017 at three clinics: Center Clinic on 11/14/17 with 7 screenings in which 4 needed a scheduled procedure (lesion removal/biopsy). Viborg Clinic on 11/20/17 with 21 screenings in which 11 needed a scheduled procedure. Parker Clinic on 11/28/17 with 3 screenings. Deb Hauger, Public Health Nurse, provided an educational presentation on \"Sun Exposure and Skin Cancer\" in August 2018. Impact of the Strategy to Improve Care of Patients with Depression Diagnosis 1. The depression assessment tool was utilized in Sanford OneChart to provide follow-up care for patients whose initial PHQ-9 score was greater than 12. The PHQ-9 form is a questionnaire that is used as a screening tool for identifying depression. A low score is preferred, and as the score increases, the patient is more likely to be suffering from some form of depression. A patient with a score over 12 may have major depression or dysthymia. a. In 2018: There were 391 screenings completed with 57 screenings that were 12 or greater. Based on the screenings that were completed, 14.5% of the patients have moderate to severe levels of depression. Depression follow-up care was provided at 100% for these 57 patients. b. In 2017: There were 584 screenings completed with 55 screenings that were 12 or greater. Based on the screenings that were completed, 9.4% of the patients have moderate to severe level of depression. Depression follow-up care was provided at 100% for these 55 patients. 2. No action was taken for establishing mental health telemedicine services and/or outreach clinic in 2017 and 2018. In 2019, an outreach mental health clinic was established with Changing Behavioral Health. 3. An e-prescribing software along with fingerprint readers was implemented in FY2017. Prior to this software, the providers gave the patient a paper prescription for narcotics. A paper script increases the risk of the patient making fraudulent copies and access to narcotics. With the e-prescribing software, the provider's fingerprint is required to electronically submit a script to a pharmacy to be filled. The South Dakota Prescription Drug Monitoring Program (PDMP) is also utilized by the providers and nursing staff. 4. Education was provided during the year on the use of opioids and the use of pain contracts. The baseline measurement for the number of patients on a pain contract was 23 patients in FY2016, and the number of patients on pain contracts remained at 23 for FY2017. In 2018, there were 34 patients on a pain contract, and during the year, 8 contracts were terminated. 2016 Community Feedback Pioneer Memorial Hospital and Health Services is prepared to accept feedback on our Community Health Needs Assessment and has provided online comment fields for ease of access on our website. There have been no comments or questions to date. 38 APPENDIX 39 Primary Research Pioneer Memorial Hospital & Health Services - Asset Mapping Identified community concern Community stakeholders specific areas of concern Secondary Data - Focus on South Dakota Report and County Health Rankings Community res ources that are available to address the need Economics Employment options 3.73 Affordable housing availability 3.55 Maintaining livable and energy efficient homes 3.5 11% of respondents say 'money problems' are a concern Turner County unemployment 3.2% 9% of county residents indicate they have housing problems (overcrowding, high housing costs, lack of kitchen facilities, or lack of plumbing facilities 47% of residents have commutes to work that exceed 30 minutes Employment resources: SD Dept. of Labor Job Service Office (Sioux Falls, 45 mi) - 605-367-5300 SD Works - link DLR On-the-Job Training Program - 605-773-4133 Start Today SD Apprenticeship Program - link Veterans Employment Info - link Regional Job Search Sources - www.viborgsd.org Low-income apartments: Village Apartments - 605-326- 5464 Danish Villa Apartments - 605-263-3941 Meadowland Apartments - 605-271-4663 Dox Apartments - 605-263- 3941 Washington Square Apartments - 605-263-3941 SD Housing Development Authority (SDHDA) - 605-773- 3181 Governor's House Program Southeastern Council - 605-681- 8184 Parker Housing and Redevelopment Commission - (Parker, 19 mi) - 605-297-4918 40 Identified community concern Community stakeholders specific areas of concern Secondary Data - Focus on South Dakota Report and County Health Rankings Community res ources that are available to address the need Children and Youth Bullying 3.5 Cost 3.5 and availability 3.4 of quality child care Stakeholders also raised up lack of youth-adult mentoring opportunities as a concern 14.2% hav e 3 or more ACEs (Adverse Childhood Experiences - physical/sexual/emotional abuse, mental illness of a household member, alcoholism of a household member, drug use by a household member, divorce/separation of a parent, domestic violence towards a parent, incarceration of a household member) 3.6% have 5 or more ACEs 12% of children live in poverty Bullying / at -risk youth resources: Turner Co.
