FODMAPs (fermentable oligo-, di- and monosaccharides and polyols) are a family of short-chain carbohydrates (sugars) that draw water into the intestinal tract and may be fermented by intestinal bacteria, leading to diarrhea, cramping, gas and bloating when eaten in excess. Those who have eliminated gluten but are still experiencing gastrointestinal symptoms may be sensitive to FODMAPs; however, a FODMAP sensitivity does not mean that you are sensitive to all FODMAPs. An elimination diet is required so you can determine exactly which foods you are sensitive to, which can include: fructose (honey, high-fructose fruits like apples, pears, cherries and mangoes); lactose (dairy products); fructans (wheat, barley, rye, garlic, onions); galactins (beans, lentils, soybeans); and polyols (stone fruits like cherries, peaches, nectarines, plums, avocadoes). After six weeks on the elimination diet, you can slowly re-introduce foods a little at a time to see which ones prompt a reaction. People suffering from IBS, small intestinal bacterial overgrowth (SIBO), ulcerative colitis and Crohn's disease have been shown to benefit from a low-FODMAPs diet.Healing Diets In the world of health and nutrition there is no shortage of diets. You've probably heard of some of the more popular ones\u2014raw food diet, vegan/vegetarian diet, Paleo diet, Mediterranean diet... and the list goes on. However, there is a class of diets that you may not be as familiar with, diets like the low-FODMAPs diet, the GAPS diet and the Autoimmune Paleo diet. They are highly specialized diets that are used as a method of healing, especially for those who suffer from gut and digestive issues or an autoimmune disease. In general, they are more like elimination diets in which you can eventually reintroduce certain foods. Here' s the lowdown on each one: The following books are excellent starting points if you are interested in learning more: The AIP diet is intended for people with autoimmune diseases and is a refined version of the Paleo diet. It excludes grains, sugar, dairy, legumes, starches, vegetable oils, processed foods and alcohol, with the additional elimination of eggs, nightshades (potatoes, eggplants, tomatoes and peppers), nuts, and seeds. While removing the aforementioned foods, this diet stresses including nutrient-dense foods such as bone broth, organ meats, especially liver, large amounts of vegetables, naturally raised meats and fermented foods. The AIP diet gives the body a chance to calm the autoimmune response, return a healthy balance to the gut microbiota, heal the gut lining and reduce inflammation. Some people may eventually be able to reintroduce some of the prohibited foods specific to the AIP , such as eggs or nuts. This diet (\"Gut and Psychology Syndrome\") grew from the idea that many mental, autoimmune and neurological disorders stem from an imbalance in intestinal flora and a damaged intestinal wall, resulting in inflammation and malabsorption of nutrients, and eventually, a disease state. It is a diet focused on restoring gut health, which will improve overall health. The diet is based on nutrient dense foods including grass-fed meats, bone broth, healthy fats, eggs, fish, fermented foods, organic fruit and veggies, and nuts. All processed foods, grains, starches, sugar, soy and vegetable oils are prohibited.

It is the preferred source of fuel for immune cells and the cells that line the gastrointestinal (GI) tract. It is essential for proper GI, immune and muscle function. Under stressful conditions, including intense exercise, serious illness, surgery, injury or even malnutrition, the body's reserves are rapidly depleted, making supplementation necessary. Additionally, because muscle tissue is the main place where glutamine is produced, people with low muscle mass, such as the elderly or those with muscle wasting diseases may be at risk for glutamine deficiency.*L-GlutamineJarrow\u00ae L-Glutamine Powder $899 4 oz.

The human body was built for regular physical movement\u2014it is crucial for optimal health\u2014but regular physical activity can alter the body's need for certain nutrients, specifically, those that support energy production, build, repair and maintain muscle, and fight inflammation. Taken in conjunction with a nutrient-dense diet, certain dietary supplements can help fine tune your body, allowing you to get the most out of your fitness routine. gooD nutrition, aDequate HyDration, anD sufficient rest are fundamental for general health, but especially important to support and sustain the body during physical activity. In addition to these basic factors, consider these key supplements: B-vitamins. The B-vitamins play a varied and extensive role in the human body. They are necessary for cellular energy production, ensuring there is enough energy for physical activity; the synthesis of oxygen-carrying red blood cells; normal immune function; and for building and repairing damaged tissue. Athletes who have low B-vitamin statuses may not perform as well, especially at high intensities. In one metabolic feeding study, a group of male athletes were depleted of the B vitamins thiamin, riboflavin, and B6 over a three-week period by eating mainly processed foods. The athletes' exercise performance decreased significantly at the end of the three weeks. Other research suggests that exercise may increase the need for certain B vitamins, especially riboflavin and B6. A quality B-complex supplement will ensure that you consume balanced amounts of all of the B vitamins.PRiMe Your Body for Fitness Continued on page 7By Lindsay Wilson gooD nutrition aDequate HyDration sufficient rest6Branched-chain amino acids (BCAAs). BCAAs are a group of amino acids\u2014leucine, isoleucine, and valine\u2014that are essential for muscle growth and repair. Isoleucine also helps shuttle glucose into the cells for energy. While most amino acids are metabolized by the liver, BCAAs are metabolized directly by muscle tissue. Exercise, especially endurance exercise, increases the breakdown of protein and amino acids, leading to a decline in levels of BCAAs, which can result in fatigue and muscle soreness. But supplementing with BCAAs before and after exercise has been shown to decrease muscle damage and promote muscle-protein synthesis. In one study, oral supplementation of BCAAs (77mg/kg of body weight) increased BCAA levels during exercise and led to less muscle breakdown. Similar results were found in another study in which subjects consumed 3.6 grams of amino acids with 37% BCAAs before and after exercise. The amino acid supplement decreased muscle soreness, presumably by stimulating muscle synthesis and suppressing protein breakdown and muscle damage. Whey protein. After any type of workout, the body needs protein for muscle building and repair. Whey protein is one of the best sources of BCAAs, particularly leucine, and is quickly absorbed and utilized by the muscles, giving them the food they need to stop muscle breakdown and shift to growth and repair. Whey protein also contains cysteine, an important building block of the body's master antioxidant glutathione, and has been found to increase glutathione levels. Beet root juice. A recent study published in the American Journal of Physiology\u2014Regulatory, Integrative and Comparative Physiology, found that regular consumption of 70 mL (about 1/3 cup) of beet root juice was associated with increases in blood levels of nitrates and nitrites, decreases in blood pressure, and delayed onset of fatigue in healthy men. The researchers said that the findings suggest that beet root juice can enhance physical performance by \"enhancing oxygen delivery and reducing work of the heart, allowing exercise to be performed ... for a longer period of time before the onset of fatigue. \" Compounds in beets interact with stomach enzymes to produce nitrous oxide\u2014nitrous oxide is converted into nitric oxide, which is responsible for vasodilation. Vasodilation helps improve the flexibility of blood vessels, which is suggested to help allow more blood flow to active muscle and support aerobic metabolism. Fish oil. The omega-3 fats found in fish oil support recovery by modulating post-exercise inflammation and reducing oxidative stress. One study found that 3 grams of fish oil taken daily for one week minimized delayed onset muscle soreness after strenuous strength-training exercise in healthy men and women; participants were also able to perform more repetitions after supplementation, possibly due to increased muscle strength or decreased fatigue. Other research has shown that fish oil reduces heart rate and oxygen consumption during exercise (without a decrease in performance), reduces cortisol levels and increases lean body mass, and increases muscle protein synthesis in healthy individuals. Doses in studies range from 3 grams to 8 grams daily. References available upon request. Although the body can use both carbohydrates and fats effectively as fuel, your pre-workout nutrition plan should emphasize nutrient-dense carbohydrates. The truth is that we all have plenty of stored body fat to provide the metabolic fuel we need during physical activity, but we do not have an abundance of stored carbs. The main purpose of fats in a pre-workout meal is to add variety, flavor, and satiety, not to necessarily satisfy any physiological need. Carbohydrates, on the other hand, are the main macronutrient that should be emphasized before, during, and after exercise; they are the fuel that propels energy production and fat metabolism, they keep our adrenal hormones balanced (too few carbohydrates in the diet in addition to heavy physical activity can result in chronic cortisol secretion, the first step toward developing overtraining syndrome, as well as other symptoms of chronic stress), and they spare the muscles from breaking down to free amino acids as a backup source of fuel. Just be sure to choose nutrient-dense carbohydrates such as fruits and vegetables. Protein should be consumed about every two to three hours to support physical activity. While it doesn't act as a primary fuel source for exercise, it is extremely important for repair and structural support of abused muscle tissue. Timing is also key: Solid food should be eaten about 1.5-2 hours before physical activity; as the workout draws closer, shift to liquid foods. Don't eat too much, as you will send your body conflicting signals (fight or flight vs. rest and digest). Typically, a pre-workout meal would avoid fat, or be low in fat, so that carb absorption and digestion is minimally affected. Medium chain triglycerides (MCTs), such as those found in coconut oil, are the exception\u2014 the rate at which MCTs are absorbed and metabolized match carbohydrates, making MCTs an effective food fuel before and during exercise. If you're not metabolically primed to work out, then your body will hit a wall and stop you in your tracks no matter how motivated you are. With a little nutrient know-how and timing, you can always ensure that your body is fueled up to give its all.fueling uP for Your Workout7 By $17.55Spicy food giving you trouble again?

The intestinal mucosal barrier, which contains a vast number of immune cells, including T-cells, immunoglobulin A (IgA), and macrophages, is one of the body's first lines of defense against pathogens; in fact, nearly 70 percent of the immune system is located in the gut. To carry out its important role in immune function, the gut must be in tip-top shape, however, due to poor diets, the overuse of antibiotics, excessive alcohol consumption, and a myriad of other reasons, many guts are not. But the amino acid L-glutamine has the ability to heal the gut and prevent damage, supporting a healthy gut and healthy immunity. Glutamine is a major fuel source used at high rates by our white blood cells and aids IgA antibody production. Y es, those fighting T-cells, macrophages, and all require glutamine to do their job! In fact, lymphocyte (T-cell) proliferation is dependent on sufficient amounts of glutamine. Glutamine also helps maintain the structural integrity of the intestinal lining by preserving healthy gut mucosa and protecting the villi that line the gastrointestinal tract. During illness, surgery, traumatic injury, viral or bacterial infection, or even chronic stress, glutamine concentrations in tissues decrease and intestinal mucosal barrier functions are impaired, increasing the demand for glutamine. Controlled studies have shown that glutamine supplementation improved immune function in postoperative patients, increasing both T-cell and IgA production, resulting in a reduction in the frequency of infections and a decrease in the length of hospital stays. Glutamine has also been shown to shorten the duration and accelerate mucosal healing and regeneration in those suffering with diarrhea and colitis, as well as decrease intestinal permeability caused by long-term use of non-steroidal anti- inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs). Whether it's taken as a preventative measure to maintain healthy immunity or to actively heal the gut mucosa, glutamine is a powerful amino acid that's up for the challenge. Common dosages for supplemental glutamine fall between 500-1,000 milligrams, three times daily, between meals. Give your gut\u2014and immunity\u2014a little extra support with glutamine!

Know Your Grocer Highest Quality Standards by Jack ChallemTM The independent newsletter that reports vitamin, mineral, and food therapies.As the research accumulates, it increasingly appears that our gut bacteria have a profound effect on our health and risk of disease. And taking probiotic supplements and eating more fiber-rich vegetables can reinforce our \"good\" gut bacteria and yield diverse benefits. Probiotics have been well established for their benefits in resolving infectious diarrhea, antibiotic-induced diarrhea, traveler's diarrhea, and vaginal infections. And studies dating back to the 1990s show that gut bacteria help maintain normal immunity. But the latest frontiers in research on our gut bacteria have demonstrated surprising benefits. Colorectal Cancer. Researchers from the University of Pittsburgh and other institutions noted significant differences in the gut bacteria of rural Africans and African Americans. Rural Africans, who have a low risk of colorectal cancer, had predominantly butyrate-producing bacteria. Butyrate is a cancer-protective substance formed when gut bacteria feed on dietary fiber. Meanwhile, an animal study at the University of Michigan found that gut bacteria changed during the development of colorectal tumors\u2014with the changes fueling tumor development. The researchers wrote that \"interventions that target these changes...may be an effective strategy for preventing the development of colorectal cancer. \" Rheumatoid Arthritis. Scientists at the New Y ork University School of Medicine reported that a loss of beneficial bacteria \"strongly correlated\" with the onset of rheumatoid arthritis in patients. Then, by transferring some of the pathogenic bacteria to mice, the researchers were able to induce colitis\u2014another inflammatory disorder\u2014in the animals. Allergic Asthma . An animal study at the University of Lausanne, Switzerland, determined that a high-fiber diet protected against allergic airway disease similar to allergic asthma. The researchers determined that gut bacteria metabolized the fiber and increased levels of short- chain fatty acids, which protected against allergic inflammation in the lungs. Metabolic Disorders. Researchers at the University of Copenhagen studied 292 Danes and found that about one-fourth of them had fewer gut bacteria and less diversity in the species present. These subjects also had more of the types of bacteria that cause low-grade chronic inflammation. A related French study found that a six-week weight-loss diet in obese subjects increased both the numbers and variety of gut bacteria. Behavior. Gut bacteria communicate with the brain by sending signals through the vagus nerve, making neurotransmitters, and by influencing the immune system. Researchers at the California Institute of Technology, Pasadena, reported that an animal study found abnormalities in gut bacteria, setting the stage for neurological disorders characteristic of autism spectrum disorder. Treatment with B. fragilis , obtained from human subjects, corrected gut permeability and resolved neurological problems. Eczema. Doctors at the University of Otago, New Zealand, conducted a double-blind study in which pregnant women were given supplemental L. rhamnosus , followed by giving the probiotics to infants from birth to age two years. Children receiving the probiotics had a lower incidence of eczema and less allergic sensitization. Colic . Italian researchers gave 589 infants either supplemental L. reuteri or placebos daily for three months. After the first month, children receiving probiotics cried less and had more frequent bowel movements (i.e., were less constipated). By the end of the study, babies receiving probiotics spit up less and needed less medication for stomach problems. Rapid Changes Possible. Harvard University researchers reported that major dietary changes\u2014such as switching from eating a lot of plants to animal foods\u2014leads to changes in the composition of gut bacteria within one day. Editor's Note: Poor eating habits and oral antibiotics can have disastrous effects on our gut bacteria. Sometimes, such as after antibiotic therapy, the effects can last weeks or months. As a consequence, I recommend taking two steps. First, eat more fiber-rich vegetables. Y our gut bacteria secrete many beneficial substances when they digest fiber. Second, take a probiotic supplement every day or two. It will help maintain regularity and, based on the evidence, will have both short- and long-term health benefits. There are many different supplements available, but strive for a mix of Lactobacillus and Bifidobacteria strains. References: Ou J, et al.

James V . Pottala, PhD, of the University of South Dakota, Sioux Falls, and his colleagues measured red blood cell levels of EPA and DHA in 1,111 post-menopausal women whose average age was 78 years. They also took brain scans to determine the volume, or size, of the women's brains. Pottala and his colleagues followed up on the women eight years later. Those who had the highest blood levels of both EPA and DHA had brain volumes that were 0.7 percent larger. These women also had a 2.7 percent larger hippocampus, a part of the brain involved in memory. Intake of EPA or DHA individually did not appreciably influence brain volume\u2014only the combination did. Brains normally shrink a little with aging. In Alzheimer's patients, the hippocampus starts to shrink before symptoms appear. The researchers wrote that low omega-3 levels might indicate a greater risk of hippocampal atrophy. A large body of other research has demonstrated the critical importance of EPA and DHA in brain development and in reducing the risk of mood disorders, aggressive behavior, and many other psychiatric and neurological disorders.

Quick Reviews of Recent Research Silicon may protect against Alzheimer's The mineral silicon is not currently regarded as an essential dietary nutrient, but the evidence suggests that it can be highly beneficial\u2014and may be regarded as essential in time. It has been found to strengthen bones and joint cartilage, as well as improve skin, hair, and fingernails. Researchers from Keele University in the United Kingdom asked 15 Alzheimer's patients and 14 of their caregivers to consume about 1 quart of silicon-rich water (containing 35 mg of the mineral) daily for 12 weeks. During this time, urinary excretion of aluminum\u2014a metal suspected of playing a role in Alzheimer's\u2014increased in both patients and caregivers. Davenward S.

The study focused on 60 subjects who took either the B-complex formula or placebos daily for 60 days. By the end of the study, people taking the B vitamins benefited from reduced signs of depression and anxiety. Lewis JE. ISRN Psychiatry , 2013:621453. Vitamin D might affect Parkinson's patients Researchers at the Veteran's Administration Medical Center in Portland, Oregon, measured vitamin D levels in 286 patients with Parkinson's disease. The patients were also given multiple tests to assess the severity of their disease, cognitive function, and mood. Among patients not suffering from dementia, higher vitamin D levels were associated with better verbal fluency and verbal recall. Higher vitamin D levels are correlated with fewer indicators of depression. Peterson AL. Journal of Parkinson's Disease, 2013;3:547-555 Pesticide linked to Alzheimer's risk Researchers at Rutgers University, New Jersey, studied levels of the pesticide DDT and a metabolic byproduct known as DDE in 86 patients with Alzheimer's disease and 79 healthy subjects. DDE levels were almost four times as high in Alzheimer's patients compared with subjects who did not have the disease. Also, people with the highest DDE levels were more than four times more likely to have Alzheimer's disease. People with the APOE4 genetic variation appeared to be more susceptible to the effects of DDE. Both DDT and DDE increase levels of amyloid precursor protein\u2014amyloid protein is involved in the development of Alzheimer's. JAMA Neurology, 2014: doi 10.1001/ jamaneurol.2013.6030. Licorice root is a traditional remedy for treating gastric ulcers. And perhaps not coincidentally, the bacterium H. pylori is a common cause of such ulcers. Now, researchers have found that the herb significantly reduces levels of H. pylori in people diagnosed with the infection. Researchers from India and South Korea studied 107 people with H. pylori infection. About half of them took 150 mg of a licorice root (Glycyrrhiza glabra) while the others took placebos daily for 60 days. At the end of the study, all of the subjects underwent urea breath tests and stool antigen tests to assess H. pylori levels. Forty-eight percent of the subjects taking licorice root extract tested negative for the bacterium on the breath test, compared with only 2 percent in the placebo group. Similarly, 56 percent of people taking licorice root extract tested negative with the antigen test, compared with 4 percent in the placebo group. Reference: Puram S, Suh HC, Kim SU, et al.

Evidence-Based Complementary and Alternative Medicine, 2013;2013:263805 Nutrients work as teams, and so while calcium, magnesium, and vitamin D may be the big players in bone health, many other nutrients exert an influence on bones. A new study focused on the potential role of vitamin E in preventing fractures of the hip and other bones. Karl Michaelsson, MD, PhD, of Uppsala University, Sweden, and his colleagues tracked 61,433 elderly women for an average of 19 years and 1,138 men for 12 years. During this time, 14,738 women developed fractures, including 3,871 fractures of the hip. Men had 139 fractures, including 51 fractures of the hip.Women who consumed relatively little vitamin E had an 86 percent greater risk of fracture. Women who took supplements containing vitamin E had a 14 percent lower risk of any type of fracture and specifically a 22 percent lower risk of hip fracture. Men who had low intakes of vitamin E were almost twice as likely to develop a fracture and more than three times more likely to suffer a hip fracture. The risk of hip fracture decreased as the amount of vitamin E intake increased. Reference: Michaelsson K, Wolk A, Byberg L, et al. Intake and serum concentrations of a-tocopherol in relation to fractures in elderly women and men: 2 cohort studies. American Journal of Clinical Nutrition, 2014;99:107-114. BONE FRACTURE RISK might be reduced with Vitamin E Patients with fibromyalgia suffer from chronic and extensive pain, as well as fatigue, sleep disorders, poor concentration, and sometimes mood issues. They are also commonly deficient in vitamin D, and yet no controlled studies of the vitamin have been conducted in fibromyalgia patients. Until now. Florian Wepner, MD, of the Orthopedic Hospital in Vienna, Austria, and his colleagues analyzed data on 30 patients who completed a controlled trial of vitamin D supplements. All of the subjects had vitamin D levels less than 32 ng/mL, and 70 percent of them had levels below 24 ng/mL, pointing to marginal and more serious deficiencies. Thirty subjects\u2014mostly women\u2014received either 1,200 IU or 2,400 IU of vitamin D3, or placebos, daily for 20 weeks. Wepner's objective was to increase blood levels of vitamin D to between 32 and 48 ng/mL. The subjects underwent a battery of tests when the study began and 24 weeks after ceasing the supplements. Wepner reported that people taking vitamin D supplements had a \"marked reduction in pain\" during the treatment and for at least 24 weeks afterwards. They also benefited from better physical functioning. Reference: Wepner F, Scheuer R, Schuetz-Weiser B, et al.

By Heather Pratt, MNT Unless you've been hiding under a rock you've likely seen a burgeoning number of gluten-free products showing up on store shelves, heard a friend espouse the virtues of a gluten-free diet, or maybe even given up gluten yourself. Gluten-free is all the rage these days. But for its popularity, confusion about gluten abounds\u2014even among some of those following a gluten-free diet. If you've found yourself wondering, \"What's the deal with gluten?\" Or ever had to mumble your way through a confused explanation about why you're eating gluten-free, read on, this one's for you. What is gluten and why is it so bad? Gluten refers to a family of proteins that naturally occur in the cereal grains wheat (and its relatives spelt, emmer, einkorn, kamut), rye, barley, and triticale. Gluten proteins are sticky and strong, and give bread and other baked goods structure, elasticity, and chewiness; it acts as a sort of glue that holds certain foods together. Without gluten, breads are dense and crumbly. Gluten is largely what makes bread, well... bread. But gluten also prompts an abnormal immune response in some people, and if it isn't eliminated, can lead to major health problems. Ideally, during digestion, proteins such as gluten should be broken down into individual amino acids and then absorbed through the small intestine, but gluten proteins are difficult for the human digestive tract to break down, which can cause serious problems for some people. One in every 133 people in the United States has celiac disease\u2014an autoimmune disease in which gluten triggers the immune system to attack the lining of the digestive tract\u2014and another 30 percent of Americans may have gluten sensitivity, aka, \"non-celiac gluten sensitivity. \" In either case, malabsorption of nutrients and inflammation can occur. Gluten also opens up the tight junctions that bind intestinal cells together, leading to \"leaky gut\" which allows proteins that are not fully digested (like gluten) to enter the bloodstream, triggering an immune response. Malabsorption, inflammation, and leaky gut create a vicious cycle, with inflammation leading to leaky gut, and leaky gut leading to inflammation, and both leading to more malabsorption. This is why individuals who are intolerant to gluten can experience such a wide variety of symptoms. As the damage progresses, the immune system may become hyper- vigilant and begin to attack other parts of the body, leading to autoimmune diseases. How do you know if you're gluten intolerant? Not long ago it was hallmark digestive symptoms like gas, bloating, and diarrhea that may have been the first clues that gluten was a problem. But today we know digestive symptoms are just the tip of the iceberg and many people with celiac disease and gluten sensitivity experience no digestive symptoms whatsoever. In these people, symptoms like joint pain, skin conditions, brain fog, autoimmune diseases, migraines, mood issues, infertility, osteoporosis, and fatigue are some of the clues that point to gluten intolerance. Because celiac disease and gluten-sensitivity can manifest as so many different symptoms, in different parts of the body, it can be incredibly difficult to get an accurate diagnosis. The standard tests used by most doctors only test for one specific type of gluten: gliadin, which is believed to be responsible for the damage that occurs in celiac disease. But there are numerous gluten proteins that one can react to, so a negative test result only means there is no immune reactivity to gliadin, and therefore no celiac disease, but it doesn't necessarily mean there isn't a sensitivity to one of the other gluten proteins. More extensive testing for non-celiac gluten sensitivity to other gluten proteins does exist through Cyrex labs, but these tests are not standard practice. A simple way to determine if you are sensitive to gluten is to completely remove it from your diet for three weeks and see how you feel. Improvements in symptoms likely indicate that gluten is problematic for you. Note that in some chronic cases, like autoimmunity, it may take up to six months to notice improvements. Why is everyone suddenly sensitive to gluten? There's no question that celiac disease and gluten sensitivity are on the rise. Using modern testing procedures on preserved blood samples from the 1950s, researchers at the Mayo Clinic were able to determine that celiac disease is four times more common today than it was back then. Why are we seeing this increase? No doubt increased awareness and diagnostic tools have helped to diagnose people with celiac disease that may have otherwise been missed, but the increase goes far beyond better diagnostic tools. First, we eat a lot of gluten. Most people consume it at breakfast, lunch, dinner, and snacks. Second, today's modern wheat\u2014most people's main source of gluten\u2014is not what it used to be. Wheat has been hybridized to increase yields and to improve baking characteristics. Modern wheat has new gluten proteins and more genes for producing gluten proteins that are associated with celiac disease than the wheat of 100 years ago. While this is good news for food manufacturers and bakers, it has been disastrous for our bodies. Combine this increased gluten intake with our increasingly poor gut health, caused by stress, antibiotics, poor diet, and increased toxin exposure, and we've created the perfect storm for triggering celiac disease and gluten sensitivity. What does a healthy gluten-free diet look like? The first step to a healthy gluten-free diet is to eliminate all gluten. This includes the obvious sources like wheat, rye, barley, and triticale and any product made from these grains such as bread, pasta, cookies, crackers, tortillas, etc. But gluten hides in many less obvious places like oats (unless specified gluten-free), sauces, soups, gravies, beer, imitation bacon and crab, some cheeses, and numerous other prepared food items, supplements, and medications. It is important to educate yourself on all the ways gluten might be slipping into your diet and work to get them all out. Otherwise, a healthy gluten-free diet should look a lot like any other healthy diet. It should be built around foods like brightly colored fruits and vegetables, organic and naturally-raised meats, wild fish, cold-pressed virgin olive oil and coconut oil, nuts and seeds, and full-fat, pastured dairy products as tolerated (about 50 percent of those with celiac disease also experience an inflammatory response to dairy). For those that choose to include grains and legumes in their diet, stick with whole gluten-free grains like quinoa and brown rice, ideally soaked and/ or fermented, and beans that have been properly prepared by soaking and slow cooking. While gluten-free options abound for everything from pasta and bread to cookies and donuts, these products tend to be loaded with other types of refined gluten-free flours and sugar and are better saved for the occasional treat. Once you know the basics of gluten it is pretty easy to see why it's such a big deal and, more importantly, why it might be worth pursuing a gluten-free diet yourself. After all, the solution to a myriad of health problems might be as simple as hopping on the gluten-free bandwagon. References available upon request.21 All items are available while supplies last.

This potent antioxidant aids the liver's detoxification processes and helps regulate the immune response. Italian researchers gave 262 seniors either 600 mg of NAC or placebos twice daily over the cold and flu season. Of the people with laboratory-confirmed flu infections who were taking NAC, only 25 percent developed symptoms. In contrast, 79 percent of the men and women taking placebos developed clear-cut flu symptoms, according to an article in the European Respiratory Journal . Other studies have confirmed the immune benefits of NAC. Take : 600 mg twice daily during the cold and flu season. On the first day of symptoms, increase the amount to 2,400 to 3,600 mg daily and continue until symptoms subside. Vitamin D. Researchers have noted that the wintertime increase in cold and flu infections appears directly related to less seasonal sun exposure and lower vitamin D production. Y our body needs vitamin D to make a variety of germ-fighting factors, such as the important antimicrobial compound cathelicidin. Some research shows that the vitamin can reduce the risk of contracting the flu. Take : 5,000 IU daily for adults, and up to 1,200 IU daily for children. Adults can also boost their vitamin D intake to 10,000-20,000 IU daily for the first several days of a cold or flu, then resume a lower dose. Zinc Lozenges. Harri Hemila, Ph.D., of the University of Helsinki, Finland, crunched data from 199 patients who took either zinc lozenges or placebos. Zinc lozenges led to significant decreases in all cold symptoms, including nasal discharge, congestion and hoarseness. Zinc lozenges eased symptoms and reduced cold length by one day, according to a separate analysis of 1,360 people. Take : One lozenge every two to four hours until symptoms subside. Zinc lozenges are most effective when started at the first sign of cold symptoms.The yellows and reds of autumn, as pretty as they may be, presage another change that comes this time each year: a much greater risk of catching the common cold or flu. But the truth is you don't have to sit idly by waiting to get sick. Y our body's immune system defends against all manner of infections. And like every other cell in your body, its individual constituents, from lymphocytes to natural killer cells, depend on nutrition for optimal functioning. The best plan of action is to take steps early on to enhance your immunity. And if you feel that a cold or flu germ is already at your doorstep, you and your family members can take steps to reduce both the symptoms and duration of the infection. My recommendations are based on what I take preventively or to aggressively fight back against a cold or flu. Although their order of priority is subjective, the science supporting these supplements is objective and sound. In my experience, I have been able to consistently reduce a seven-day cold to just two-and-one-half days of very mild symptoms. As for the flu, it's been some 40 years since I contracted the virus, and I haven't gotten a flu shot in at least 20 years. It's crucial to start, or increase the amounts, of these supplements on the first day you experience the slightest symptoms. Waiting until the second or third day is far less effective. That's because virus concentrations increase astronomically by then, and your immune system (which accounts for many of your symptoms) has gone into overdrive. I also suggest keeping a basic \"nutritional first aid kit\" at home or in the office, because if you start developing symptoms, will you have the time to rush to the store and buy the supplements you need? This kit could include N-acetylcysteine, vitamin C, zinc lozenges and other supplements depending on your own preference. Beating the Cold and Flu Season24 By Jack Challem, American Society for NutritionProbiotics. From infancy on, our gut bacteria help program our immune systems. New research has shown that some specific types of probiotics can blunt cold and flu symptoms in both children and adults. Bifidobacterium bifidum eased cold and flu symptoms in stressed out college students. In a study of children in day care centers, Lactobacillus rhamnosus GG reduced upper respiratory tract symptoms. Still other research has shown that Bifidobacterium lactis and Lactobacillus brevis can improve cold and flu symptoms. Take : What the label suggests. Any or all of the mentioned strains should provide preventive benefits when taken long term. Vitamin C. Although critics dismiss the benefits of vitamin C, the science supports its use in reducing cold and flu symptoms, but the key is taking enough. Vitamin C seems of particular benefit to people exposed to cold and snowy weather, otherwise known as winter. Other research has shown that it reduces cold and flu symptoms among stressed children and adults. Y ou might wonder who isn't stressed these days\u2014so the vitamin can benefit just about everyone. Take : Studies have found that the ideal wintertime dose of vitamin C is 2 to 6 grams (2,000 to 6,000 mg) daily, but much less for small children. Lysine . This amino acid got people's attention decades ago when researchers at the Indiana University School of Medicine, Indianapolis, found that it inhibited the growth of herpes simplex, a virus that causes cold sores. People taking lysine had fewer infections, shorter infections and faster healing. Other studies have been conflicting, but lysine is certainly worth a try when it comes to fighting cold sores\u2014or the common cold itself. Take : 1,000 mg three times a day at the first onset of symptoms. HerBAL reLIeF echinacea. One of the most popular herbal remedies in Europe, echinacea (Echinacea spp. ) works wonders when it comes to reducing the odds of catching a cold or flu, and it also seems to ease symptoms. An analysis of 14 human studies, published in Lancet Infectious Diseases , found that echinacea supplements slashed the odds of catching a cold by an impressive 58 percent. For people who did catch a cold, the herb cut its duration by a day and a half. Take : Follow label directions, but tinctures may be more effective than capsules. elderberry . Elderberry (Sambucus nigra ) can quickly reduce the aches, pains and tired feeling that usually accompanies the flu. In one study, Israeli researchers found that 14 of 15 people taking elderberry extract had a significant reduction in symptoms, including fever, after just two days, and 13 of the 15 patients were symptom free after three days. Most of the studies have used an elderberry syrup, not capsules. Take : Follow label directions for use, but opt for a sugar-free syrup. AHCC. This mushroom extract, technically known as \"active hexose correlated compound, \" appears to boost the activity of a family of immune cells, known as natural killer (NK) cells. NK cells are among the most powerful of immune cells and specifically target virus-infected cells and tumor cells. Take : 1,000 mg daily.Panax Ginseng. Ginseng has for centuries been considered a tonic and rejuvenator in Asia. A study published in the Canadian Medical Association Journal has found that North American ginseng (Panax quinquefolium ) can benefit people during the cold and flu season. The study involved 232 adults who frequently caught colds. The herb slashed the length of colds by one-third, and it slightly reduced the odds of catching a cold. Take : What the product label recommends. Andrographis. Studies have found that this Chinese herb (Andrographis paniculata ) can greatly reduce symptoms of upper respiratory infections, the very symptoms associated with the flu. Its benefits may be enhanced when combined with Eleuthero (Eleutherococcus senticosus), which was originally known as Siberian ginseng. Take : Either or both of these herbs during a cold or flu, and then stop when symptoms are gone. HOmeOP A tHIC remeDIeS Oscillococcinum \u00ae. Of all the homeopathic remedies, oscillococcinum (pronounced os-sil-uh-cox-suh-num) has good evidence that it can reduce flu symptoms. Homeopathy uses minute doses of substances, with low doses having a greater effect than high doses. Although the theory might sound counter- intuitive, it does make sense from the point of view of molecular biology, in which trace amounts of substances can significantly affect cell function. A respected Cochrane Collaboration review described it as a \"promising\" remedy and noted that it \"probably reduces the duration of illness in patients presenting with influenza symptoms. \" Take : What the label suggests, starting on the first day of a cold or flu. Oscillococcinum contains extremely minute extracts of duck heart and liver, so it might not be suitable for vegetarians. Not every supplement will work the same way for every person, in part because of our genetic and lifestyle differences. Still, you've got a pretty broad choice of natural options to help you avoid catching a cold or the flu this autumn and winter. Now is the time to start stocking your natural medicine cabinet so you are armed to beat cold and flu season.

Wash your hands often with warm or hot soapy water. 2. Do your best to avoid touching objects, such as phones or doorknobs, that have been touched by infected people. Y ou can wipe them down with alcohol swabs or wash your hands. 3. Resist the temptation to touch your face, nose, or ears, especially after shaking hands with someone who is infected. Again, wash your hands often. 4. Moderate exercise is good for your immunity. Over-exercising can make you more susceptible to infection. 5. People tend to close up their homes during colder months. So, occasionally open your windows or go outside for some fresh air. 6. Get enough sleep and watch your stress levels. Burning the candle at both ends weakens your immunity.Maintaining a healthy diet\u2014with ample amounts of veggies and fruits\u2014is essential for a healthy immune system. That's because most nutrients play important roles in our body's natural resistance to infections. If you're a senior, and you intend to get a flu shot, your body requires adequate vitamins B12 and A for the vaccine to work. As a safeguard, it might be wise to take a multivitamin supplement. Conversely, be mindful of food choices\u2014namely, sugary foods\u2014that can weaken your immunity. Doctors have long known that people with poorly controlled diabetes are more susceptible to infections. Scientifically, decades old research has shown that sugary foods reduce the ability of white blood cells to fight germs. eating rigHt boosts your iMMunity More Ways to Survive the Cold and Flu Season $479 25 ct. eDAP $5.89 Blue Diamond\u00ae Almond Breeze boxes. $199 32 oz. eDAP $2.59 Daily Greens\u00ae Core Green Juices $429 12 oz. eDAP $5.29 Beautiful blends of nutrient-rich dark leafy greens and lighter, juicier greens that are as delicious as they are nutritious.
