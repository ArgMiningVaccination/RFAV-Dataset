Find out how to get all-natural relief. Pharmaceutical drugs may not be your only path to pain relief. Natural [pain treatments](https://www.everydayhealth.com/pain-management/physical-activity-and-therapy.aspx) \u2014 like herbal medicine, in which parts of a plant are used medicinally to treat health problems \u2014 is an increasingly popular way to manage pain as well. Though research on herbal remedies is still in its early phases, many herbs are thought to provide [pain management](/pain-management/physical-activity-and-therapy.aspx) and decrease inflammation. However, it's important to exercise caution. \"Herbals or other nutraceuticals that may help in some way \u2014 as well as those which may not actually help \u2014 do almost universally have the potential to harm through unwanted side effects, [allergic reactions](/allergies/), and undesirable interactions with other substances and medicines,\" says Sam Moon, MD, MPH, associate director of education at Duke Integrative Medicine, a division of Duke University Medical Center in Durham, N.C. \"Relative safety must be very carefully balanced against likely effectiveness.\" Natural Pain Relief: Popular Herbal Options Here are some common herbal remedies used for natural pain relief: - Capsaicin. Derived from hot chile peppers, topical [capsaicin](/drugs/capsaicin-topical)may be useful for some people in relieving pain. \"Capsaicin works by depleting substance P, a compound that conveys the pain sensation from the peripheral to the central nervous system. It takes a couple of days for this to occur,\" says David Kiefer, MD, assistant clinical professor of medicine at the Arizona Center for Integrative Medicine. - Ginger. Though more studies are needed, says Dr. Kiefer, ginger extract may help with joint and muscle pain because it contains phytochemicals, which help stop inflammation. Few side effects have been linked to ginger when taken in small doses. - Feverfew. Feverfew has been used for centuries to treat [headaches](//www.everydayhealth.com/migraine/guide/), stomachaches, and toothaches. Nowadays it's also used for [migraines](/migraine/guide/)and [rheumatoid arthritis](/rheumatoid-arthritis/guide/). More studies are required to confirm whether feverfew is actually effective, but the herb may be worth trying since it hasn't been associated with serious side effects. Mild side effects include [canker sores](/canker-sore/)and irritation of the tongue and lips. Pregnant women should avoid this remedy. - Turmeric. This spice has been used to relieve arthritis pain and [heartburn](/gerd/guide/), and to reduce inflammation. It's unclear how [turmeric](/drugs/turmeric)works against pain or inflammation, but its activity may be due to a chemical called curcumin, which has anti-inflammatory properties. Turmeric is usually safe to use, but high doses or long-term use may cause indigestion. Also, people with [gallbladder](/gallbladder/guide/symptoms/)disease should avoid using turmeric. - Devil's Claw. There is some scientific evidence that this South African herb may be effective in managing arthritis and lower [back pain](/back-pain/guide/), but more research is needed. Side effects are very rare if taken at a therapeutic dose for the short term, but it's not advised for pregnant women and those with [gallstones](/gallbladder/guide/)or stomach or intestinal [ulcers](/peptic-ulcer/). Natural Pain Relief: Proceed With Caution There are many other herbal remedies for natural pain relief, such as boswellia and willow bark. The American Pain Foundation also lists these herbs for pain management: - Ginseng for [fibromyalgia](/fibromyalgia/guide/) - Kava Kava for neuropathic [sciatica](/sciatica/), arthritis, and neuropathic pain - Valerian root for spasms and muscle cramps Since herbal therapies for pain management have yet to be thoroughly studied, be careful when embarking on this treatment path. Regardless of the herb you try, remember that they're not benign. Research into their safety and efficacy is still limited, and the government doesn't regulate herbal products for quality. The best course is to talk to a health-care professional before testing out a herbal remedy. "}
