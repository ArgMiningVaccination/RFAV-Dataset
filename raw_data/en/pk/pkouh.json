For more information about how to use the Circle of Health see [Whole Health: Integrative Care Starts With Me](/files/webfm-uploads/documents/outreach/im/handout-Whole-Health-it-starts-with-me-Final.pdf) [Self-Care]- Organized into eight components of pro-active self-care and focused on lifestyle strategies and skills to support the whole person, body, mind, and spirit. [Professional Care]- Explore ways clinicians and others can enhance whole health and well-being for various conditions through an integrative approach while bringing the best clinical care to patients. [Complementary and Integrative Approaches]- Explore therapeutic and lifestyle approaches to health that focus on the whole person, are informed by evidence, and are aimed at achieving optimal health and healing. [Integrative and Whole Health Implementation]- Integrative Whole Health is patient-driven and personalized. As a system, Integrative Whole Health seeks a cultural shift in perspective within healthcare teams, medical centers, and beyond to empower patients and be more fulfilling for clinicians. The resources in this section explore how clinicians can engage in their own self-care to increase resiliency and avoid burnout and how to implement strategies in clinical practice to achieve the goals of Integrative Whole Health.
