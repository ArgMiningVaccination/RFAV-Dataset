REVIEW ARTICLE Open Access Traditional Healers as Health Care Providers for the Latine Community in the United States, a Systematic Review Maria L. Cruz,1,*Samantha Christie,2Estrella Background: Due to structural barriers to accessing the biomedical health care system, traditional healers (THs) often serve as the rst point of contact for health care by Latine individuals in the United States. A recent assess- ment of the extent of use of THs by the Latine community is lacking. Methods: We conducted a systematic review of the literature published between 2000 and 2020, to assess the prevalence of use of THs by U.S. Latine individuals, health conditions for which care was sought, reasons for their use, and extent of TH use and dual use that is of biomedical health care and TH together. Primary inclusion cri-teria for studies included: (1) published in English, (2) focus on THs, (3) pertained to Latine individuals residing in the United States, and (4) published since 2000. Results: Eighty-ve studies were reviewed; 33 met inclusion criteria. Under the overarching term of curanderos ,4 subtypes of and hueseros . The of TH use varied from 6% to 67.7% depending on the demographic differences among the Latine individuals in these studies. Primary reasons for seeking care from THs were accessibility/convenience, affordability, and linguistic and cultural congruence. Discussion: The use of THs is highly prevalent for Latine community residing in the United States because they are accessible, affordable, and provide culturally and linguistically compatible care, indicating that they offer an alternative that addresses systemic structural barriers to biomedical health care. Further research on the efcacy and safety of the treatments rendered by THs and how their care might be optimally coordinatedwith biomedical health care, could improve health equity and access to care among Latine individuals in the United ;sobadores ;yerberos ;espiritualistas 1Department of Public Health, San Francisco State University, San Francisco, California, USA. 2Department of Biology, San Francisco State University, San Francisco, California, USA. 3Department of Epidemiology and Biostatistics, University of California, San Francisco, California, USA. 4Division of Intramural Research, National Institute on Minority Health and Health Disparities, Bethesda, Maryland, USA. *Address correspondence to: Maria L.

Latine individuals have disproportionately higher rates of obesity, diabetes, uncontrolled high blood pres- sure, heart disease, and cancer compared with non- Latine Whites. 4-6Many systemic structural factors in the United States have led to Latine individuals' lower socioeconomic status, on average, compared with the non-Latine White population.7Historically, Latine individuals in the United States have also faced large disparities in health insurance coverage. In the United States, health care services are provided mainly through employer-based health insur- ance, Medicare, or Medicaid, and individuals not cov- ered under these may face barriers (e.g., immigration status, low-wage paying jobs) to seek and pay for health care services.8As a result of barriers to accessing the biomedical health care system, the Latine community, especially immigrants, seek complementary care, in- cluding those provided by traditional healers (THs). Understanding the role of THs in the Latine commu-nity may inform ways to combine traditional healing with biomedical health care to promote health equity for Latine individuals in the United States. THs residing in the Latine community can serve as the rst point of care for Latine individuals and their families who do not have access to other medical care, or as an alternative for Latine individuals who may be dissatised with biomedical health care because biomedical providers may not be able to deliver linguis- tically and culturally appropriate care. 9For example, THs are often sought because they speak a communitymember's native indigenous language or dialect (e.g., Quechua, Aymara, Chol, Carib). these THs engender trust as they retain tra- ditional, indigenous belief systems about health, and use these beliefs and systems to serve the Latine com- munity in a way that is familiar to them. The World Health Organization denes traditional medicine as the ''sum total of the knowledge, skills,and practices based on the theories, beliefs, and experi- ences indigenous to different cultures, whether explica- ble or not, used in the maintenance of health as well asin the prevention, diagnosis, improvement, or treat- ment of physical and mental illness.'' 11There are many types of THs and services that the Latine com- munity utilizes in the U.S. Consistent with the liter- ature and practice, we will use the term curandero (means ''someone who heals'' in Spanish) to refer to THs in this review.10,12,13Curanderos can be classied into to heal patients. Sobadores often perform massage-like therapy and commonly treat ''empacho'' or constipation and musculoskeletal pain. Yerberos (or hierberos) prescribe herbal teas, baths, and poultices to cure physical and mental illnesses. Espiritualistas apply faith, spirituality, and rituals to mend the soul. Hueseros are known for addressingmuscle pulls, sprains, and resetting broken bones. While these types may have some overlap, these deni- tions are useful for understanding THs and the roles they play in the health of the Latine community to pre- serve health and cure illness. A new recognition of healing through indigenous practices is spreading in the United States, and the use of alternative and complementary medicine is on the rise. 17According to the National Institutes of Health (NIH), alternative and complementary medicine is de- ned as ''use health care approaches that are not typi-cally part of conventional medical care or that may have origins outside of usual Western practice,'' when these practices are used in addition to biomedical care they are considered ''complementary.'' 18,19 Given evidence that Latine individuals experience limited access to biomedical health care, and the ability of THs to provide care that is linguistically and cultur- ally appropriate, as well as the increasing interest in tra- ditional forms of healing and wellness, the aims of thissystematic review were to assess: (1) the prevalence of TH use and types/modalities used by U.S. Latine indi- viduals; (2) health conditions/illnesses, for which TH care was sought; (3) reasons for TH use; and (4) extent of TH use and dual use, which is the use of both TH and biomedical health care. Methods This systematic review of the literature was undertakenfollowing the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses criteria (Fig. 1). 20In Octo- ber 2020, potential studies were identied through a search of PubMed and EMBASE using the following terms: [''sobador'' OR ''sobadores'' ''shaman''/exp OR ''shaman'')]. This search was guided by an information specialist at the University of Cali- fornia San Francisco (UCSF) Kalmanovitz Medical Library. Titles that were not relevant were excluded.Studies were included if they fullled the following cri- teria: (1) touched on one of the four TH types of inter- est; (2) focused on services for the Latine community inthe United States, (3) published in English and (4) pub- lished between 2000 and 2020. We felt that there may be greater generalizability and relevance to the current health care context if studies were conducted after 2000. FIG. 1.

THs, traditional healers.Cruz, et al.; Health Equity 2022, 6.1 http://online.liebertpub.com/doi/10.1089/heq.2021.0099414Additional studies were found through citations and an updated PubMed, PsychLit, and CINAHL search in October 2020, using the same search strategy and terms suggested by the research librarian, but expanding to include these additional databases based on research li- brarian recommendation. Full-text studies of selected articles were read by the authors (E.A., S.C., M.L.C.,and K.M.) and coded using an extraction form (Google spreadsheet). The quality of eligible articles was assessed based on select outcome measures recommended by the Meta- Analysis of Observational Studies in the Epidemiology group, 21and included study quality, dened as the rep- resentativeness of the sample, the suitability of the measures used, and completeness of reporting. There was not a focus on a specic health outcome (suchas diabetes) as THs treat conditions holistically. The following data items were collected on each study: year, title, authors, journal, type of healer, population group, number of participants, documentation/citizen- ship, geographic area covered, age range, health care access, education, and prevalence of TH use. We calcu- lated prevalence of TH use in each study according to the formula, number of participants who reported TH use divided by the total number of participants in- cluded in the study. Results Characteristics of studies and study participants Originally, we identied 82 studies using PubMed and 3 from EMBASE. All titles were screened ( n=85); 57 were eliminated. Full-text review of 28 identied 5 additional studies, which yielded a total of 33 studiesthat were included in the review (Fig. 1). Of the stud- ies reviewed, 8 were quantitative, 8 were mixed meth- ods, 10 were qualitative, 4 were narrative and 3 were case reports 9,10,13,15,16,19,22-39(Table 1). All studies were deemed to be of high or moderate study quality, based on representativeness of the sample, the suitabil- ity of the measures used, and completeness of report- ing. Characteristics of the individuals in these studies were typically adults, mostly men, and only one studypresented a case of a child. Mexico was the most fre- quent country of origin of the recipients of traditional healing in nine of the identied studies. Included stud- ies had limited reporting of study participant char- acteristics, and for the most part did not address important characteristics such as educational levels, employment, income, country of origin, or health conditions (Appendix A1).THs in the United States were studied in several key states. Of the 33 studies in this systematic review, 9 were national studies. Of the remaining 24 studies, par- ticipants resided in California (5), North Carolina (5), Texas (3), Colorado (2), New Mexico (2), New York (2), Oregon (2), Florida (1), Michigan (1), and Wash- ington (1) (Fig. 2). TH terms and denitions General TH terms used and their denitions, common TH subtypes, and the locations of practice are found in Table 2. The most common type of THs were cura- nderos (overarching terms that included subtypes), fol- lowed by espirtualistas, and yerberos. Prevalence of TH use, and types/modalities used The use of THs among the U.S. Latine community iscommon, possibly as common, or more common than use of biomedical health care providers. In a recent stud- ies of 200 Latine individuals, 64% used THs. 24,37Among these, 19.5% had been treated by a sobador, 4.5% by a curandero, 2.0% by an herbalist, and 2.0% by a spiritualhealer. 24In another study of 806 participants, nearly 60% of Latine individuals described using folk healing methods and/or healers for the treatment of their chil- dren's diarrhea.29In Mexican women, the lifetime prev- alence is as high as 67.7%.25A study with 405 subjects, found that 118 (29.1%) had been to a curandero at some time in their lives and 91.3% of participants knew of curanderos.13The use of a ''medicine man or woman'' was more than three times higher in Latine individuals and Native Americans compared with Whites.22From the studies reviewed, the lifetime prevalence of THuse varied from 6% to 67.7%, and the prevalence in the last year varied from 7.2% to 28%, partially depend- ing on the sociodemographic differences among the Latine individuals in these studies (Table 1). THs practiced a range of treatment modalities to ad- dress these conditions (Supplementary Table S1). These modalities can use physical treatments like rub- bing or massaging. 10,15,25,40,41Santerias are commonly used by THs and function as the visible door to the in-visible world of folk healing. 42Yerberos usebota\u00b4nicas as a resource for people who seek ethnomedicine and eth- nobotany alternative medicine, which contains naturo- pathic treatments involving herbal teas and foods.29,43 For example people with diabetes use a concoction ofherbs as a supplement in addition to their medication 14,32,37 THs diagnose clients based on the client's descrip- tion of their current ailment and with minimal history,Cruz, et al.; Health Equity 2022, 6.1 http://online.liebertpub.com/doi/10.1089/heq.2021.0099415Table 1.

THs let the cli- ent talk about their life events because this relaxes them, but, do not rely upon laboratory values to heal.9 Curanderos use a practice of ancient holistic treat- ments that heal individuals through targeting three hi- erarchical realms: the religious and/or spiritual realm, the emotional realm, and the process of health andmental illness. 10Connection with the natural and su- pernatural, nding emotional and mental balance, and the holistic/naturopathic alternatives to release en- dorphins and decrease cortisol to ease pain and stress.10 Some curanderos view physical health as dependent onan individual's four bodily fluids (humors), which con- sist of hot fluid of the blood, yellow bile, cold fluid of phlegm, and black bile. 34Some used spiritual healing practices based on a belief that healers were giftedhigher powers to heal by God. Their practice is not identied as a career choice but a mission. 9 Prayer is used to bring healing powers to medicine.34 The idea of spiritual healing originates from indigenous communities residing in present-day Mexico and Cen- tral America. These indigenous communities had a be- lief, stated in Lak'ech, an indigenous language, tu\u00b4eres mi otro yo (''we are one''). It states ''we,'' the people, are one within a spiritual connection to everything sur- rounding them\u2014family, community, the elements, stars, moon, sun, and universe.10Spiritualism is the connection with the mind, body, and spirit. THs recog- nize that the spirit is responsible for the balance and restoration of health.10People treated by THs explain that when the human-spirit connection encounters an adverse experience, the body and spirit are at greater risk of being out of balance within themselves, others, and/or the environment.10Spiritual healers believe ill- ness is caused by this imbalance and they act as medi- ums to heal the imbalance.41 THs also call and conjure spirits to assist people with their healing process (spirits of deceased relatives, or spirits of famous THs).26Religion additionally could play a role in the practice of spiritual healing. Some THs use practices from Catholicism for example pictures, statues, saint medallions, crosses, holy water, candles, altars, and prayer.13,44Additionally, those who go to THs also use prayer as a primary form of self-care24because it may reduce clients' levels of stress and anxiety.30,34A national qualitative study found that 6% of participants consulted a curandero, 60%prayed for healing, 49% asked others to pray for heal- ing, and 69% considered spiritual healing as very im- portant. 16Health conditions addressed Table 1 describes various conditions identied across aspectrum of physical, mental, and spiritual health, for which the Latine community sought THs. THs were sought out to address conditions related to gastrointes- tinal problems, empacho (82.5%) sought THs to help with acute conditions (7.5% used them to treat chronic conditions),24primarily work-related injuries that they viewed as a consequence of hard physical labor.35Sup- plementary Table S1 depicts some of the treatmentmodalities for these conditions. Reasons for use of THs Reasons for the use of THs among Latine individualsincluded accessibility/convenience, affordability, and acceptability due to cultural and language congruence. Widespread structural and cultural factors affecting theLatine community in the United States were evident in their decision making related to the use of THs, includ- ing immigration status, dissatisfaction with biomedical medication, folk illnesses and cultural healing prac- tices, and lack of familiarity on the part of biomedical health care practitioners with these cultural viewpoints of wellness and illness. 16 Accessibility/convenience. THs operate from small multiuse spaces embedded in the community or in set- tings in nature, making them highly accessible. THs' homes are typically located in the Latine communities they serve.13They offer their services until late evening, so they are accessible to people who work long hours. Sometimes, THs work out of bota\u00b4nicas \u2014herbal phar- macies dispensing dried herbs and tinctures, as well as religious/sacred items. Bota \u00b4nicas can be part of a community market, a local flea market, or located in a sacred private natural location. THs also work from santer \u00b4as. Similar to bota \u00b4nicas, santer \u00b4as are often found in community multiuse locations where candles, books, oils, herbs, sacred necklaces, and medicines are sold. Santer \u00b4as also offer spiritual consultations orCruz, et al.; Health Equity 2022, 6.1 http://online.liebertpub.com/doi/10.1089/heq.2021.0099421rituals that are thought to mobilize benecial life forces to decrease uncertainty and/or stress. Visiting a sante- r\u00b4a can help to maintain or reinstate balance and a sense of control over one's life, with the goal being to live the life that has been assigned to you in the best way possible. THs are integrated into their communities, taking on many roles (e.g., doctor, psychiatrist, religious guide). They may address physical, emotional, and spiritual needs of the client.26Furthermore, as stated in one study, ''a traditional healer's higher purpose is to tend to the spirit of people.''10They do this by giving hope to clients and by building their emotional support net- work. Hope grows because the TH reassures them that the future will be better than the present, especially in those who are going through life transitions. THs alsoprovide safe spaces for people who have failed to nd biomedical solutions for their problems, by listening to people's worries and uncertainties. 28 Affordability. Community members rely on THs to provide affordable services and treatments. This may be even more pertinent for Latine individuals who are undocumented or otherwise ineligible for employ- ment- or government-based health insurance. One participant reported that ''as a person without healthinsurance it is easier, safer, and cheaper to go to a tra- ditional healer than a [biomedical] clinician.'' 27Partic- ipants understand that it is necessary to seek medical care but the high cost is the most frequently cited bar- rier.33A study found that participants believed THs are accessible and affordable, unlike biomedical health care services.32Many Latine individuals work in low-wage jobs that do not offer health insurance, such as farming or domestic work and therefore cannot afford biomed-ical health care treatment. 35Many Latine individuals are exploited for labor and stripped of workers' rights, for example in the construction industry if employees report a work-related injury they risk getting red so they would rather go to a TH.24 The cost of treatment varies by TH. A study inter- viewing THs found that one had a set fee, $30 for a three-visit course of treatment, whereas a sobador con- sidered $50 reasonable since massaging takes a toll on their hands. THs set affordable prices as they see their job as a calling to provide a community service. Somesobadores leave it up to the client based on their ability to pay the sobador(a), with clients paying between $1 and $100. 9Acceptability due to cultural and linguistic congru- ence. Traditional and complementary services, such as THs, can be more acceptable to some members of the Latine community because these culturally com- petent and sensitive approaches can improve health outcomes, decrease stigma, and address disparities in access to treatments.48Barriers to biomedical health care identied were high cost of services, distance to providers, lack of transportation, and limited hours of availability of services, all of which contribute to par- ticipants' frequent use of THs.35Another study found comparable results citing problems with communica- tion, establishing nancial eligibility, and extremely long waits for medical appointments.30 Latine individuals may favor THs over biomedical providers due to language concordance or the inability to follow medical jargon. One large study found that after seeing a biomedical/medical professional, Latineindividuals report confusing language used by pro- viders (23%) or feeling frustrated (27%). 16Another study observed that 59% of participants rated their ca- pacity to communicate with their biomedical health care providers through survey as ''sometimes have problems communicating'' and 6% indicated ''fre- quently had with biomedical.23Communi- cation barriers among biomedical physicians and Latine individuals go further than merely not speakingthe same language. Even if the biomedical physician speaks Spanish, THs may communicate more effectively due to their sharing the same cultural background. Dual use of THs and biomedical health care None of the studies included systematic classicationof health care seeking by Latine individuals as: TH used alone, biomedical care alone, or dual use; there- fore, it was not possible to estimate the prevalence of dual use. THs, did however, acknowledge the legiti- macy of biomedical diagnoses and medicine. 9THs had clear notions as to how to heal specic conditions and recognized that they could not address all biomed- ical diagnoses. Consumers of TH services expressed that it would be ideal to have a health care providerwho understood and was willing to use both traditional and biomedical systems to treat their illness. 36One study found that patients are open to discussing their use of THs with their biomedical health care providers if they have an accepting and nonjudgmental attitude, while not making patients feel rebuked or fearful.31 One study concluded that understanding the use of tra-ditional healing remedies could improve approaches toCruz, et al.; Health Equity 2022, 6.1 http://online.liebertpub.com/doi/10.1089/heq.2021.0099422biomedical health care because these professionals may benet from positive applications of common TH practices.19 Discussion This systematic review, covering the past 20 years, dem-onstrates that THs are commonly used by the Latine com- munity living in the U.S. Based on the studies reviewed, the use of THs among Latine individuals in the U.S. ranges from 6% to 67%. Participants in these studies tended to be adults, male, and Mexican American in origin. Latine in- dividuals sought THs for common conditions, such as gastrointestinal problems, childhood diarrhea, diabetes, 30 musculoskeletal pain and injuries, insomnia, fever, weight loss, substance use, and emotional distress. Con- ditions included those that disproportionately affect Lat- ine individuals, for example diabetes. THs or curanderos were often generalists or in some instances specialists like sobadores, yerberos, espirtualistas, and hueseros. The Latine community sought the services of THs for reasons of accessibility/convenience, affordability, and cultural and linguistic congruence. Our estimates of the prevalence of TH use among Lat- ine individuals in the United States are consistent with two prior reviews that reported high use of complementary al- ternative medicine.49Another prior review found that traditional healing practices among Mexican and Mexi- c a nA m e r i c a n sm a yb ea sh i g ha s7 5 %i ns o m ep a r t so f the United States.50Latine individuals may seek care from THs before accessing the biomedical health care system. Although it is not stated explicitly in most studies, Latine individuals may have been left with no other op- tion than to use THs as their only health service if theywere unable to access biomedical/medical systems. As such, understanding the role that THs play and develop- ing better reciprocal relationships between traditional and formal health care may lead to increased health equity. THs are so widely used because they address wide- spread barriers to use of the biomedical health care sys- tem among Latine individuals. Because THs live in the same communities as their clients and they offer evening hours, they alleviate barriers of missed work and lack oftransportation. These reasons for use are concordant with a prior systematic review. 12They tend to be less costly than biomedical health care and are culturally and language concordant. Moreover, there may be in- creased trust or condence in THs because they do not ask about immigration status. Their care is viewed as more person-centered because they use a mix of spir- itual and religious practices, which are familiar and treatthe ''whole person.'' Given the high prevalence of use and other advantages, understanding how THs estab- lish trust and meet the needs of the Latine community may help inform how to address some of these common barriers in biomedical/medical contexts. Despite the high prevalence of TH practices, there is a dearth of peer-reviewed literature on the topic. Ongoingand future studies can help elucidate the optimal use of THs to serve the needs of the Latine community. Future research should examine wheth er Latine individuals uti- lize THs as the rst point of care and whether they choose to use TH out of preference or because it is the only type of care that is feasible for them. Future efcacy and effec- tiveness research is needed to ascertain when TH services are benecial (specic treatment modalities and diseases or conditions), as well as any potential risks or harms. Tri-als could test whether TH modalities when combined with biomedical health care (dual use) yields better health outcomes than biomedical health care or TH use alone. Qualitative studies with THs may elucidate where the healers feel they are making an impact, how they view their role in the public health/medical system and their relationship to biomedical/medical health systems. For example, lay health care workers or promotores/as de salud , traditionally play a critical role in bridging access of Latine communities to biomedical approaches. 51 This type of model could be expanded to include THs. Several limitations of this article deserve comment. The populations tended to not be well characterized in terms of education, income, languages, language pro- ciency, and health conditions. Therefore, generalizabil- ity of our ndings to specic Latine individuals or specic health outcomes is difcult to assess. There were a range of ages included in our studies; most of the groups had low formal education. It is unclear whether any generational or educational differenceswere the reasons for TH use. Recognizing that Latine communities are heterogeneous and diverse, we encour- age future studies to report additional ethnic subgroup details and focus on the health outcomes of those s e r v e db yT H s .W h i l ew ew e r eu n a b l et oa s s e s st h ee f - fectiveness of traditional therapies in treating preva- lent disease conditions, our ndings provide valuable insight into the heterogeneity in the disease condi- tions and treatment approaches addressed by THs. This review focused on the U.S. Latine community and excluded those from other countries, therebymissing knowledge external to the United States. Similarly, studies published in Spanish were not in- corporated. A possible source of bias is publicationCruz, et al.; Health Equity 2022, 6.1 http://online.liebertpub.com/doi/10.1089/heq.2021.0099423bias, that is, researchers with data on the prevalence of TH use in diverse race/ethnic groups did not publish their data, therefore, our review may underestimate the prevalence of use. Furthermore, there is great vari- ability in the denitions used for the various types of THs that were included in this study. However, a strength of our review is that we provide a detailed def-inition of several key TH types, modalities, and con- ditions/illnesses for which they are used. There have been a few past reviews focused on cura- nderismo and healing practices in the United States. These studies did not cover 20 years, nor did they extract information on the use of THs alone, or dual use with the biomedical/medical system. Our review ex- pands and improves on this prior work by using a system- atic approach guided by a library scientist and covers 33studies assessed for their quality in the peer-reviewed public health literature spanning 20 years. Instead of framing the use of an indigenous, nonbiomedical health practice as an alternative, or ''less good than biomedical healthcare,'' we took the approach to learn about the community and their needs on ''equal footing.'' 10 Public health practitioners and physicians in the United States may benet from understanding the tra- ditional forms of healing used in Latine communities. Seeking care from THs should be further studied and utilized to optimize care. As is the case for biomedicalhealth care, both the potentially benecial and iatro- genic effects of treatments must be systematically stud- ied, as harmful side effects and toxicities associated with TH practices have been known to occur. 52Knowl- edge exchange between THs and physicians could be mutually benecial and help address potential treat- ment interactions and iatrogenic effects. THs could work alongside public health and medical professionals to educate them on cultural humility and cultural rele-vance, thereby perhaps engendering more trust in the biomedical/medical system as cited by one study high- lighting this pairing as a benecial partnership. 48 Biomedical/medical institutions could implement additional services (such as linkages to traditional heal- ing) to be able to improve the health of Latine and other communities that seek care from THs. Indeed, younger doctors seem open to this idea. At the Univer- sity of New Mexico Public Health and General Preven- tive Medicine Residency Program, all residents agreed that: ''not knowing about traditional healing practicesin use by patients could result in adverse outcomes due to interactions of biomedical/medical treatment and substances such as herbs used by the patient''and they ''would recommend learning about traditional healing practices to other health care providers.'' 19 Conclusions THs are commonly used by Latine individuals residingin the U.S. THs deliver person-centered care and ad- dress systemic barriers faced by Latine communities in the United States by providing linguistic and cul- turally concordant care that is accessible, affordable, and incorporates spiritual, physical, and mental heal- ing. Coordination of THs with biomedical health care represents an opportunity to improve the delivery of patient-centered, high-quality care for the Latine com-munity and improve health equity.
