I well recall, as we began our own programme in Hackney, the enthusiasm of the first cohorts of the elderly and infirm, many of whom had been housebound for months. Their faith was well rewarded: the vaccines have turned out to be more effective than most experts expected in terms of preventing serious disease and death, and, even at the cost of rare allergic reactions and blood clotting problems, safer than some feared. Given the high death rates that followed [the emergence of the Delta strain earlier this year](https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/2021/08/10/delta-variant-has-wrecked-hopes-herd-immunity-warn-scientists/), the carnage that we would have faced without the vaccine is almost too terrible to contemplate. The speed of Britain's rollout, including the booster scheme, is a seismic achievement - now set to be put to the test again by [ omicron, the first cases ](https://www.telegraph.co.uk/politics/2021/11/27/essex-covid-news-coronavirus-variant-strain-omicron-africa-europe/)of which have been identified in the UK. There has been much talk of vaccine hesitancy and the influence of anti-vaxxers, in different countries and among different occupational groups. But I fear that the prevarications and precautionary excesses of public health authorities have also contributed to the low uptake of Covid vaccination in particular communities, allowing infection to spread with predictable consequences. I am haunted by the posters that featured in our clinic with the prominent heading - 'Pregnant?' In line with official guidelines, patients were advised that 'the vaccine has not been tested in pregnancy' and that 'those who are pregnant should not routinely have the vaccine'. Patients were sent away from the clinic to consult with their own GPs (at a time when this was difficult to achieve). The official advice was later softened, but the language remained tepid and hedging. It is not surprising that vaccine uptake in pregnancy remained low and, by the summer, some were being admitted to intensive care. It was true that the Covid vaccine had not been tested in pregnancy. But there was good reason, given the known vulnerability of pregnant women to viral respiratory illnesses such as flu, to fear the impact of Covid - and flu vaccines are routinely administered in pregnancy. The whooping cough vaccine is also used widely and this is usually given together with polio, diphtheria and tetanus, though this has not been tested specifically in pregnancy. A similar precautionary approach claiming inadequate testing among the elderly delayed the launch of Covid vaccination in several European countries. These delays, exacerbated by political controversy surrounding [the AstraZeneca vaccine](https://www.telegraph.co.uk/astrazeneca/), appear to have contributed to [the current upsurge on the continent](https://www.telegraph.co.uk/global-health/science-and-disease/storm-clouds-gather-central-europe-fourth-wave-covid-pushes/). Precautionary zeal triggered by very rare cases of mild heart inflammation also delayed the extension of Covid vaccination in Britain to teenagers last summer, contributing to the autumn upsurge (causing more cases of myocarditis). Inconsistency over different schedules for booster jabs and controversy over different vaccine brands has contributed to the slow uptake, despite impressive evidence of their efficacy. Though we little expected at the start of our programme that 12 months on we would be giving many patients their third vaccination, it is impressive - and a relief to all - that the more elderly and vulnerable are still keen to get them. A scandal we failed to learn from It is now more than 10 years since [the exposure of neglect and abuse of people with autism and learning disabilities](https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/2016/05/31/families-fury-over-painfully-slow-progress-after-winterbourne-vi/) at a special treatment unit at Winterbourne View near Bristol. This scandal led to pledges to close such units and transfer residents to appropriate community facilities - pledges that have missed every deadline that has been set over the past decade. Last week, an official report revealed there are still 2,070 such patients incarcerated in specialist hospitals. The average duration of confinement is 5.5 years; 100 people have been detained for more than 20 years. The National Autistic Society notes continuing scandals and \"alarming cases of over-medication, seclusion and unnecessary restraint\", observing that hospital care is \"rarely helpful and "}
