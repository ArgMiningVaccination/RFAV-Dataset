Clair Eliason, MD, Jennifer Myszkowski, Anne Marbella, MS, and Dale N. Rasmann, MS, RD Background: Many Americans are using alternative medical therapies as well as nutritional or dietary supplements that include vitamins, minerals, herbal products, tissue extracts, protein solutions, and other chemicals. Potential for both good and harm exists in taking many of these preparations. Methods: We surveyed 200 consecutive patients older than 18 years attending a family practice clinic. In addition to demographic data, we asked them about their intake of dietary supplements during the past year, perceived benefits from supplements, source of information, estimated cost of products, and whether their physician knew that they were taking the product. Results: Fifty-two percent of the patients had taken 1 or more supplements during the past year, 18 percent used 2 to 5 supplements, and 3 percent took 6 to 13 different dietary supplements. Twenty-nine percent took them for diet and energy enhancement, and 24 percent for cancer prevention and immune system enhancement. The media was the principal source of patient information. Thirty-three percent of patients had not told their physician of their supplement use. The average estimated expenditure was $6.60 per month with a maximum of $68.90 per month. Eighty-two percent of the supplements taken were vitamins and minerals at recommended daily allowances (RDAs), whereas 18 percent were other supplements such as herbal products, megadose vitamins, and protein and amino acid preparations. Demographically, only educational level correlated significantly with supplement consumption. Patients with a high school education took significantly fewer supplements than those with more advanced education. Conclusions: Physicians should have a dialogue with their patients about dietary supplements because their use is widespread. Whereas many supplements are taken in safe doses, for others neither safety nor effectiveness has been proven, and for a few there are known toxicities. Additional research is needed to investigate both the safety and effectiveness of these products. 0 Am Board Fam Pract 1996;9:249-53.) Nutritional or dietary supplements come in a vast array of preparations, including vitamins, herbal compounds, minerals, animal glandular and tissue extracts, protein and amino acid preparations, other plant extracts, and chemicals. The supple\u00ad ment industry has grown from a fledgling indus\u00ad try into a multibillion dollar economic force. 1 The Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has Submitted, revised, 28 March 1996.

Even when a toxic reaction occurs, the burden of proof for safety rests with the FDA, not the manufacturer. In general, the FDA can only warn the public and is limited in its ability to remove a product from the market.

Tradition, oftentimes the media, anec\u00ad dote, folklore, and non-Western medicine argue for the benefits of nutritional supplements, and beneficial medications have been described and extracted from various plant products. 14,15 Very few of these claims, however, are accompanied by scientific documentation. More scientific data are needed about public consumption and motivation to consume nutri\u00ad tional supplements. To gain more information about the consumption of dietary supplements and the perceived benefits, we conducted a survey of patients in family practice center located in a suburban academic medical center. Methods During a 3-week period in July 1994, we inter\u00ad viewed 200 consecutive patients older than 18 years who visited a family practice clinic located in a suburban Milwaukee academic medical cen\u00ad ter. A research assistant recruited and interviewed the patients in the examination room immediately before or after the physician visit depending on time constraints at the clinic. Before each inter\u00ad view the assistant obtained consent for the inter- 250 JABFP July-August 1996 Vol. 9 No.4 view and assigned an identification number to the patient. Confidentiality was assured. Demographic information included age, sex, race, educational level, and exercise level. We asked patients about nonprescription medications, vitamins, minerals, herbal compounds, amino acid and protein preparations, and any other com\u00ad pound that they were taking. We then elicited in\u00ad formation about the ingredients of the product(s), benefits promised (ie, weight loss or gain, cancer prevention, etc), dosage, cost per month of the product(s), and how the patient learned of the product. We also asked whether the patient's physician had recommended the product and whether the physician knew the patient was taking it. If the patient could not supply the information at the clinic, a follow-up telephone call was made. Analysis The responses were coded and entered into a Foxpro database, Version 2.5.16 Tabulations and Pearson chi-square tests of significance were per\u00ad formed for correlation between demographic in\u00ad formation and supplement consumption. Results Patient demographics are listed in Table 1. The patients had an average age of 42 years. They were mostly female (68 percent) and white (82 percent) and had a college education or higher (62 percent). Nearly one half (48 percent) exer\u00ad cised at least three times a week. More than one half (53 percent) of the 200 pa\u00ad tients reported taking supplements. Of these, 32 percent took 1 supplement, 18 percent used 2 to 5, and 3 percent used 6 to 13 different supple\u00ad ments for a total of209 supplements (47 different preparations or brands). Vitamins and minerals accounted for 84 percent, herbal compounds 8 percent, proteins and amino acids 3 percent, and miscellaneous the other 5 percent. Only 2 per\u00ad cent of the vitamin supplements were taken in megadoses (defined as 10 times the daily recom\u00ad mended allowances [RDA]). Eight (4 percent) of the patients were taking at least one herbal prod\u00ad uct, for a total of 16 different herbal products. Patients perceived the most common benefits from the supplements to be nutrition and energy enhancement (29 percent), followed by cancer prevention or immune enhancement (24 per\u00ad cent), and treatment of musculoskeletal problems on 13 September 2023 by guest.

The perceived patient benefits are listed in Table 2. Patient sources of information about the sup\u00ad plements were media (27 percent), physician (22 percent), general knowledge (21 percent), family or friends (20 percent), and other health care pro\u00ad fessionals (5 percent). The patients reportedly did not tell their physi\u00ad cians about the consumption of the product 33 percent of the time. Their physicians reportedly recommended the supplement only 23 percent of the time. The consumption of nutritional supplements did not correlate with age, ethnicity, exercise, or use of prescription or nonprescription medica\u00ad tions. More women (56 percent) than men (44 percent) took supplements, but this difference was not statistically significant at the P < 0.05 level. Those who had a high school education took significantly fewer supplements (P = 0.03) than those who had attended college or graduate school. Only 13 (6 percent) of the patients had an 8th grade or less education, and 10 of these pa\u00ad tients took at least one supplement; but when compared with the other educational groups, there was no statistically significant difference in the number of supplements they took (Table 3). The average estimated expenditure of those taking at least 1 supplement was $6.60 per month. Eight patients who were taking five or more sup\u00ad plements per month spent an estimated average of $24.10 per month. The maximum estimated expenditure per month for nutritional supple\u00ad ments in this study was $68.90. Discussion More than one half of the adult patients in this family practice clinic with a predominately white population had taken a dietary supplement during the past year. Most of these supplements were vit\u00ad amins and minerals taken at acceptable doses. About 18 percent of the products taken, however, were herbal products, protein and amino acid preparations, megadoses of vitamins, and other products. Our concern about the use of these latter products stems from the lack of scientific informa\u00ad tion on safety or effectiveness. There are scientific data to support the effectiveness of vitamins and minerals taken in standard doses in some situ\u00ad ations, such as by the elderly whose diets might be marginal, pregnant women, and nursing babies.

Neither group of researchers inquired about other supplements. Eight (4 percent) of the patients surveyed took 16 different herbal compounds. Despite a concern about safety and efficacy, herbal products have a long anecdotal history and tradition. Several im\u00ad portant medications, such as digitalis, atropine, and taxol, have been derived from herbal (plant) products.14,15 It is estimated that 20,000 species of higher plants are used medicinally throughout the world, and among some indigenous populations they are often the principle source of medi\u00ad cine.14,15 In some countries, such as China, there is a long history associated with herbal products, and textbooks have been written describing their use.19 Clearly, additional consideration and re\u00ad search about herbal compounds are warranted. Nevertheless, based upon the current FDA regulation, it is difficult to have medical confi\u00ad dence in herbal products for the following docu\u00ad mented reasons: (1) concentrations of active in\u00ad gredients in a plant will vary according to the year, individual plants, the maturation of the plant, and the portion of the plant extracted, such as leaves, stems, or seeds20; (2) the extraction or preparation methods are variable and can be im\u00ad precise, uncontrolled, and result in contamina- Dietary Supplements 251 on 13 September 2023 by guest.

Amino acid and protein prep\u00ad arations have little or no scientific or convinc\u00ad ing anecdotal evidence to support their claims. L-Tryptophan has resulted in several deaths be\u00ad cause of a production contamination and has been removed from the market.21 Although none of our surveyed patients took organ or tissue ex\u00ad tracts, there is little to support the use of organ and tissue extracts in nutritional supplements. The findings from our study support the im\u00ad portance of physicians talking with their patients about nutritional supplements. Improved nutri\u00ad tion, prevention of diseases, and treatment of fa\u00ad tigue appear to motivate the majority of patients taking supplements (Table 2). As these motiva\u00ad tions are all within the physician's domain, and as some supplements might be injurious or subject to misuse, physicians should inquire about the use of supplements. Two thirds of the patients stated that they had informed their physicians about the use of sup\u00ad plements, but only 23 percent of the physicians had actually recommended the supplement to the patients. These patients learned about supple\u00ad ments usually from the media, general knowl\u00ad edge, and family or friends rather than their physicians. A physician's knowledge about many of these products might be limited and require further education. Most physicians recognize that there is little scientific information about dietary supplements. As more physicians become knowl- 252 JABFP July-August 1996 Vol. 9 No.4 edgeable, it might be possible for them to recog\u00ad nize more often either beneficial or toxic effects of these supplements. The cost of the supplements did not appear to be excessive in this study with the average expen\u00ad diture estimated by the patient to be $6.60 per month. Some patients who are taking multiple supplements will spend much more than this amount, but the maximum estimated expenditure in our study was only $68.90 per month. The only statistically significant correlation between demo\u00ad graphic findings and supplements was between educational level and number of supplements in\u00ad gested. Those with a high school education con\u00ad sumed fewer supplements than those with more advanced education (P = 0.003). It is suggested from our findings and those of another study21 that educated people tend to take more supple\u00ad ments; whether they are more able to afford them or are better informed is unclear. Our study was limited by the population sur\u00ad veyed, that is, one clinic in one geographicalloca\u00ad tion. Nevertheless, our clinic population is proba\u00ad bly typical of many in the United States that are mainly white and English speaking. Other popu\u00ad lations will differ, and additional data are required to describe their use of supplements. This study illustrates that many patients are taking dietary supplements, many of which have not been ade\u00ad quately tested and some of which might be toxic. Conversely, other supplements can provide bene\u00ad fits. Additional research is needed to determine the effectiveness and safety of nutritional (dietary) supplements. The FDA should establish some minimal standards to allow physicians and the public to have greater confidence in many of those products. Physicians and health providers should engage their patients in conversation about nutritional supplements. on 13 September 2023 by guest.
