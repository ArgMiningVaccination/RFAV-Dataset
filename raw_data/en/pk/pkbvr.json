The ancient system that made its way to India more than 5,000 years ago was formally recognised by the WHO in 1976. Developed in the Indian subcontinent, Ayurveda is derived from two Sanskrit words, Ayus meaning \"Life\" and Veda meaning \"Science.\" The science of Ayurveda Related Articles The science and practice of Ayurveda were prescribed in the ancient texts. Charaka Samhita is the primary resource, a composition on general medicine written in Sanskrit. Several books have been written on Ayurveda since then. If we were to go by the ancient records, Ayurvedic medicine paved the way for several medicinal segments that are in practice today. There are currently approximately 7,00,000 certified Ayurveda doctors in India. Unlike common belief, Ayurveda treatment is about herbs and includes household substances such as honey, butter, ghee, and milk, to name a few. Mental health is on par with physical health Ayurveda stresses that there should be an equal balance between physical and mental health in a person. When balance prevails, an individual enjoys good health. Similarly, when there is an imbalance, an individual goes through various health-related ailments. Ayurveda seeks to address this state of balance through an integrated healing procedure. Following a healthy diet and practising meditation and yoga are the primary requisites of an Ayurvedic-inspired lifestyle. The primary objective of Ayurveda is to nurture and promote good health by managing and preventing diseases. Normally, treatment involves medicinal use and following a specific diet towards a prescribed daily routine. Ayurveda: A holistic healing system Ayurveda is known as a holistic healing system that cures the problem of its root, i.e., the underlying cause of the health issue and not just the symptoms. Ayurveda also emphasises prevention as much as a cure. Specialties in Ayurveda There are eight Ayurveda specialties called Ashtanga Ayurveda: Kayacikitsa (medicine), Salakya Bhuta (psychiatry medicine), Kaumarabhrtya (pediatrics), Rasayana (rejuvenation therapies), and Vajikarana (sexual health). Correlation between Ayurveda and the body Prakriti in Ayurveda means an individual's unique body constitution and identity. Body constitution is determined by birth and relies upon several factors such as race, physical structure, personality, habits, and nutrition. Genome-wide analysis correlates Ayurveda Prakriti. In 2015, a paper published in Nature studied 3500 individuals, suggesting that the physical composition of India's traditional medicine has a genetic root. Prakriti-based practice, in trend for many centuries, reverberates with personalised medicine. Impact of COVID-19 on Ayurveda and the industry During the pandemic, the importance of Ayurveda played a significant role. The surge in demand was due to the need for immunity boosters. Unlike any other therapy, Ayurveda is a lifestyle that has a long-term impact on a person's health. Companies have manufactured supplements formulated with natural ingredients understanding customers' demands to adopt the goodness of Ayurveda in their daily life. Well-known herbs like Guggulu, Yashtimadhu, Guduchi, Haridra, and Tulasi, have had a positive, multifaceted influence on immunity and respiratory functions. Ayurvedic preparations containing these herbs have significant immunomodulatory properties, whereas herbs such as Haridra, Tulasi, and Vasaka can be used to treat various respiratory ailments.
