As of May 3, the Indian government has reported almost 20 million people are sick and close to 219,000 people have died, although actual figures are thought to be much higher. \"Last year we estimated that only one in about 30 infections were being caught by testing, so the [reported cases are a serious underestimate of true infections](https://www.cnn.com/2021/04/27/india/india-covid-underreporting-intl-hnk-dst/index.html),\" Ramanan Laxminarayan, director of the Center for Disease Dynamics, Economics and Policy in New Delhi told CNN last week. \"This time, the mortality figures are probably serious underestimates, and what we're seeing on the ground is many more deaths, than what has been officially reported.\" The death toll could peak at more than 12,000 a day by mid-May \u2014 more than three times the current rate according to [prediction models from the University of Washington](http://www.healthdata.org/sites/default/files/files/Projects/COVID/2021/163_briefing_India_10.pdf).

Still, experts argue this isn't enough and that in addition to prioritizing their own citizens, Canada and other wealthy countries have a responsibility to aid other countries during a public health crisis. \"The donation mechanism is basically relying on benevolence and charity rather than these international human rights obligations that countries do have,\" Katrina Perehudoff, a researcher and fellow at the WHO Collaborating Centre on the Pharmaceutical Sector at the University of Toronto [told CBC on May 2.](https://www.cbc.ca/radio/checkup/is-canada-s-vaccine-roll-out-a-success-or-a-failure-1.6009726/as-india-sees-record-covid-19-cases-experts-say-canada-isn-t-doing-enough-to-share-vaccines-1.6010682) So, what can individual Canadians do to help? Here are a few ways you can contribute by donating to provide PPE, oxygen, medicine, and community support to India through international and regional efforts.
