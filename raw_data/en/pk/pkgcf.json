The COVID-19 booster vaccination rate has declined despite the wide availability of vaccines. As COVID-19 is becoming endemic and charges for regular booster vaccination are being introduced, measuring public acceptance and the willingness to pay for regular COVID-19 boosters is ever more crucial. This study aims to (1) investigate public acceptance for regular COVID-19 boosters, (2) assess the willingness to pay for a COVID-19 booster shot, and (3) identify factors associated with vaccine hesitancy. Our results will provide crucial insights into and implications for policy response as well as the development of a feasible and effective vaccination campaign during Vietnam's waning vaccine immunity period. A cross-sectional study was conducted among 871 Vietnamese online participants from April to August 2022. An online questionnaire based on the discrete choice experiment (DCE) design was developed, distributed using the snowball sampling method, and subsequently conjointly analyzed on the Qualtrics platform. A history of COVID-19 infection and vaccination, health status, willingness to vaccinate, willingness to pay, and other factors were examined. Among the participants, 761 (87.4%) had received or were waiting for a COVID-19 booster shot. However, the willingness to pay was low at US $8.02, and most participants indicated an unwillingness to pay (n=225, 25.8%) or a willingness to pay for only half of the vaccine costs (n=222, 25.4%). Although information insufficiency and a wariness toward vaccines were factors most associated with the unwillingness to pay, long-term side effects, immunity duration, and mortality rate were the attributes the participants were most concerned with during the vaccine decision-making period. Participants who had children less than 18 years old in their homes infected with COVID-19 had a lower willingness to pay (odds ratio [OR] 0.54, 95% CI 0.39-0.74). Respondents who had children under 12 years old in their family who received at least 1 vaccine dose had a higher willingness to pay (OR 2.03, 95% CI 1.12-3.66). The burden of medical expenses (OR 0.33, 95% CI 0.25-0.45) and fear of the vaccine (OR 0.93, 95% CI 0.86-1.00) were negative factors associated with the level of willingness to pay. A significant inconsistency between high acceptance and a low willingness to pay underscores the role of vaccine information and public trust. In addition to raising awareness about the most concerning characteristics of the COVID-19 booster, social media and social listening should be used in collaboration with health professionals to establish a 2-way information exchange. Work incentives and suitable mandates should continue to encourage workforce participation. Most importantly, all interventions should be conducted with informational transparency to strengthen trust between the public and authorities. The COVID-19 pandemic has profoundly affected numerous facets of life worldwide in the past 3 years, ranging from health, well-being, and socioeconomic status to the behavioral pattern and structural characteristics of societies [ Given the effectiveness of COVID-19 booster shots, the current health focus of COVID-19 worldwide has shifted from disease control to booster regularity and long-term maintenance [ Several frameworks have strived to describe the correlations between different factors for the acceptance of vaccines, most commonly the integrated framework of the Health Belief Model (HBM) and the theory of reasoned action (TRA) [ Moreover, the effectiveness and side effects of booster shots have been well documented. Therefore, one's decision to receive a booster is influenced by a personal preference for known vaccine characteristics rather than a hypothetical evaluation of the vaccine's severity, benefits, or public attitude, as suggested by previous frameworks. This change in the nature of predictors calls for a new approach to understanding vaccine acceptance: to investigate personal priorities for vaccine characteristics and assess the extent to which one is willing to take or pay in acknowledgment of risks. Although the initial acceptance of the COVID-19 vaccine has been well studied for 3 years, little is known about the public's willingness to pay due to the free-of-charge policy for the COVID-19 vaccine in most countries worldwide and in Vietnam [ The PREVENT (Preference For Vaccine Evaluation & Trail) study was Vietnam's nationwide assessment using a patient-centered design to inform health technology development and acceleration. Designed using the Qualtrics system, the PREVENT study included an online interactive questionnaire to target subjects across different regions of Vietnam from April to August 2022. Respondents were Vietnamese who live in Vietnam, who were aged 16 years and above (in Vietnam, people from the age of 16 years must take responsibility for their actions; moreover, they must bear penal liability like adults), and who were being referred to and agreed to complete the survey. The PREVENT study included 2 groups: (1) the general population and (2) health professionals and medical students. Snowball sampling was used for disseminating the survey, involving 20 \"seeders\" in all 3 regions: northern, middle, and southern. Participants took 30 minutes to complete the questionnaire and were encouraged to introduce more acquaintances and colleagues to the survey. Respondents were able to review and change their answers through a Back button in the Qualtrics system. The PREVENT study included 5 topics of interest: (1) COVID-19 vaccine booster for adults, (2) monkeypox, (3) COVID-19 vaccine for children, (4) HIV vaccine, and (5) a hypothetical pandemic in the future. After answering general social demographic questions, each respondent was randomly assigned to 1 of these 5 topics, generating 5 separate data sets. In total, 5700 respondents were included in the PREVENT study. The substudy of the COVID-19 vaccine booster for adults included 871 complete records. Participants were informed of the benefits and risks of participating in this study, and they provided informed consent. Records were monitored and tracked using IP addresses using the Qualtrics system to ensure the validity of the data set; they were then extracted, analyzed, and stored safely and confidently and used merely for research purposes. The protocol was approved by ethical review committees designated by the Vietnam Ministry of Health (decision no. 164/GCN-HDDDNCYSH-DHYHN and 13/HDDD-DHDT). We applied a standard procedure for generating the research instrument. Initially, a systematic review was conducted to identify important facets that emerged from previous studies. Next, we constructed the questionnaire, covering the breadth of measurements of interest. A group of experts in public health, infectious diseases, health services, econometrics, linguistics, representatives of target groups, and research assistants joined in the deliberation of translating, rephrasing, piloting, and shortening the questionnaire. Finally, the tool included 5 major sessions: (1) sociodemographics, (2) a history of COVID-19 infection and vaccination, (3) the willingness to take a COVID-19 vaccine booster for adults, and (4) the willingness to pay for it. A short questionnaire was designed to determine the participants' willingness to take the COVID-19 vaccine booster for adults using the following 3 items: Will not vaccinate Intend to inject COVID-19 booster shots Have completed the COVID-19 booster shots A questionnaire was designed to determine the participants' willingness to pay for vaccines using the following 5 options: To what extent are you willing to pay for the vaccine? Unwilling to pay 20% of the cost 50% of the cost 80% of the cost Full cost The actual cost of the vaccines was not known to participants. This question was used to examine the participants' willingness to pay when financial support/a discount was provided. Participants responded to questions about their sociodemographics, including age, gender (male/female), marital status (single, others), job, monthly household income per capita, and area. Participants responded to questions about their personal and family history of COVID-19, time since the last COVID-19 infection, health status, and personal and family history of COVID-19 vaccination. We used 10 items corresponding to 2 factors to measure the factors affecting vaccination to prevent disease. A 3-point Likert scale was used to evaluate the answers. Factor 1: concerns about the vaccine and responsibility to the community Item 1. Concerned that the vaccine is newly developed. Item 2. Concerned about immediate side effects of the vaccine. Item 3. Concerned about long-term side effects of the vaccine. Item 4. Concerned about new components of the vaccine. Item 5. Concerned about the immunity duration of the vaccine. Item 9. Vaccinate so the community can maintain normal living and working conditions. Item 10. Vaccinate to fulfill personal responsibility of disease prevention. Factor 1 included 7 questions. The total score was calculated by adding the scores of the 7 items and then converted to a 10-point scale. Factor 2: fear of the vaccine Item 6. Fear of vaccines and injections in general. Item 7. Fear of insufficient information to make decisions. Item 8. Wait for others to vaccinate first. Factor 2 included 3 questions. The total score was calculated by adding the scores of the 3 items and then converted to a 10-point scale. Hence, the score of factors 1 and 2 ranged from 1 to 10. Participants with a higher score indicated a heightened concern about the vaccine and responsibility to the community and a heightened fear of the vaccine. The Cronbach of factors 1 and 2 was good at .89 and .84, respectively. We included 8 items to assess the interpersonal factors related to vaccination. A 3-point Likert scale was used to evaluate the answers. There were 2 domains included: Factor 1: risks of infection and fear of the impact of the disease on health and economy Item 1. How is the risk of reinfection for you and your family members? Item 2. How is the risk of reinfection for children in your family? Item 3. How afraid are you of the spread of this disease? Item 4. Ho afraid are you of the impact on the health of this disease? Item 5. How afraid are you of the impact on the economy of this disease? Factor 2: service satisfaction Item 6. How satisfied are you with vaccination services? Item 7. How satisfied are you with COVID-19 consultation services? Item 8. How satisfied are you with health care services for pandemics? After summing the total score of each item, the total score of factors 1 and 2 was converted to a 10-point scale. Respondents with a higher score indicated a higher risk of infection and fear of the impact of the disease on health and economy or service satisfaction. The Cronbach of factors 1 and 2 was good at .87 and .91, respectively. We conducted a literature review of factors affecting the willingness to take and to pay for vaccination services and the designs of previous discrete choice experiments (DCEs) on adult vaccination. The results informed our selection of 6 major attributes of such services that influence an individual's preference, including effectiveness (<60%, 60%-90%, and >90%), immunity duration (3-6 months to a lifetime), side effects (minor [can maintain daily functioning] to major [severe fatigue and immobility]), mortality rate (0.001%-0.01%), limitations if not vaccinated (yes or no), cost of the vaccine (VND 100,000 [US $4.27] to VND 2,000,000 [US $85.33]) [ sample size for the DCE was determined using Sawtooth software to determine the number of responses: sample size = (multiplier*c)/(t*a) = 357, where multiplier=1000, \"c\" is the largest number of levels across all features (n=5), \"t\" is the number of tasks or questions (n=7), and \"a\" is the number of alternatives or choices per question (n=2). This sample size was reached for both target groups of the survey, with 461 (52.9%) in the general population and 410 (47.1%) in health professionals and medical students. Vaccine attributes in effects|| | Minor: can daily rate|| if not vaccinated|| traveling analysis was performed using Qualtrics and STATA software (version 15). Descriptive data were generated for all variables. With missing data, we used the listwise deletion method to clean data before analyzing them; 1071 records were collected, of which 871 (81.3%) records were complete, so 200 (18.7%) records were excluded from the analysis. Continuous variables were presented as the mean (SD), while categorical variables were presented as frequencies with percentages. Exploratory factor analysis (EFA) using principal component analysis (PCA) was performed to evaluate the optimal structural model of the instrument according to the observed data. The number of factors was determined based on the Scree plot, and parallel analysis, along with eigenvalues and the proportion of variance explained ( Potential covariates for full models of the decision to take and the willingness to pay for COVID-19 boosters for adults included socioeconomic data, COVID-19 characteristics, related information regarding the COVID-19 vaccine, factors affecting the intention to vaccinate for disease prevention, and interpersonal factors ( In DCE data analysis, individual-based utility models were yielded using hierarchical Bayes estimation that uses Bayesian methods to probabilistically derive the relative value of each tested variable. The models estimated the optimal package of the preferred attributes of COVID-19 vaccination and the contribution of each attribute.

This study results indicated the participants' high willingness to take COVID-19 vaccine booster shots. Their willingness to pay, however, was scattered between price levels, the most common of which were willingness to pay the full price, willingness to pay half the price, and total unwillingness to pay at all. The reasons for an unwillingness to pay and booster hesitancy were concerns of long-term effects, immunity duration, information insufficiency, lack of confidence in the vaccine, unawareness of the risk of reinfection, and dissatisfaction with COVID-19 care services. Based on the identified issues of lack of information and weakening public trust in the vaccine, we proposed personal, interpersonal, and managerial solutions to ensure affordable vaccinations and consistent uptake. The burden of medical expenses and the fear of vaccines were negative factors associated with the willingness to pay; in contrast, participants who had children under 12 years old in their family who had received at least 1 vaccine dose used the media to access information about vaccines, while concerns about vaccine characteristics and responsibility to the community had the opposite impact. In our study, 87% of the participants had taken a booster dose or were waiting to get vaccinated, which is generally higher than that in low-, middle-, and high-income countries (73.4% in low-income countries, 67.9% in middle-income countries, and 83.0% in high-income countries) [ When examined at the national level, the willingness to pay generated in our study accounted for a small fraction of the per capita monthly income of our sample (VND 3,000,000-10,000,000, or US $ 128.00-426.66). Since the effects of the COVID-19 vaccine typically start to diminish after 6 months, the actual monthly cost of a booster is even lower when spread out over months, making it a low financial burden. Indeed, a critically low willingness to pay despite a high acceptance rate might be a proxy for people's underestimation of vaccine importance, suggesting gaps in communication between the general public and authorities. This is consistent with the fact that the most common reason for vaccine hesitancy was a lack of knowledge about the vaccine. Public information about COVID-19 boosters does not cover the main factors highlighted by this study that influence the vaccine decision and willingness to pay, such as potential side effects, mortality rate, induced immunity, and effectiveness. Furthermore, as health care professionals and the media were deemed to provide the most trusted information, public education approaches should be more comprehensive and interactive, allowing for televised question-and-answer (Q&A) sessions with experts, hotline services staffed by trained practitioners, and open informational portals made available on social media. Social listening is another recommended approach to be used by governments and health organizations to understand people's perceptions and concerns, to refute false information and handle controversies, and to identify other social leaders or influencers who may have a positive impact on the general public. Our findings emphasize the importance of building public trust when disseminating information about vaccinations. Contrary to traditional vaccines with a long history of development and trials, the COVID-19 vaccine was made available on an emergency warranty after preclinical studies and only 12-18 months of multiphase trials [ Other significant factors promoting vaccine acceptance were fear of disrupting normal working and living conditions, reinfection, and re-emergence of the outbreak. In the work sphere, various interventions can be implemented to improve vaccine uptake, including paid time off for vaccinations or recovery time. A study among US workers observed that such incentives could improve vaccination rates, and they have been frequently implemented since the beginning of vaccination programs [ Interventions drawing on the fear of a COVID-19 pandemic re-emergence are numerous. Nudge interventions, such as mobile phone personal reminders or fixated appointments, have been found to be effective in increasing vaccine uptake in Denmark [ The strengths of our study included a large sample size and diverse demographics, which enabled high generalizability. Our DCE design and conjoint analysis allowed us to imitate real-life conditions of the willingness to pay and generate a more reliable result. Numerous limitations also exist, including the inability to infer causal relationships due to a cross-sectional design, the influence of the current vaccine policy on respondents' perception, and personal bias due to self-reporting. Nonetheless, this study is 1 of the first and most significant in our country to provide early insights into the public acceptance and willingness to pay for COVID-19 boosters, thus making substantial contributions to Vietnam's efforts to integrate COVID-19 boosters into its regular health care requirements. Our study showed a high willingness to take yet a low willingness to pay for a COVID-19 vaccine booster among Vietnamese participants. More importantly, the low willingness to pay was traced to insufficient information and underestimating vaccine importance. To resolve the lack of knowledge, we proposed a vaccine promotion approach with emphasis on side effects, mortality rate, immunity duration, and effectiveness, as well as social listening to counter misinformation. As the media and health experts are the most trusted information providers, their role in monitoring, directing, and resolving issues of public perception can be optimized through interactive interventions, such as Q&A sessions between influential health figures on television or an online platform, a COVID-19 vaccine-specialized hotline by health officials, and use of social listening insights. Work incentives, such as assistance for COVID-19 vaccine sick leave and technical convenience for vaccine reminders, can also be provided to encourage vaccine uptake. Above all, all vaccine promotion campaigns should be based on an open display of benefits as well as unwanted limitations of vaccines to achieve a nationally accepted regular COVID-19 vaccination in the long term.
