[Percentages used are rounded to nearest whole number]. There is a \"definite correlation be tween chiropractic care and superior health.\" 94% of medical children are vacci nated while only 25% of chiroprac tic children arc vaccinated (from abstract). 3. 69% of the chiropractic children have never had otitis media [middle ear infection], while only 20% of the medical children never had otitis media. 4. Chiropractors contend that chiroprac- tic care improves the quality of life, stimulates the immune system, and confers superior health. 5. Allopathic health care is primarily dis- ease treatment. Chiropractic healthcare is primarily preventativc. 6. 91% of the chiropractic children started chiropractic care by age 1. 7. \"95% of the chiropractors considered that chiropractic had a positive effect on their children's health.\" 8. \"This study has shown that children raised under chiropractic care are less prone to infectious processes such as otitis medial and tonsillitis, and that their immune systems are better able to cope with allergens such as pollen, weeds, grasses, etc., as compared to children raised under allopathic care.\" 9. There is a significant decreased history of antibiotic use among the chiropractic children, \"indicating a lower susceptibility to bacterial infections as a result of greater immune system response.\" The chiropractors responded that the \"recovery period from any trauma or illness by their children was more rapid than that of their children's peers.\" Non-immunized chiropractic children who came down with those childhood diseases seemed to have minor diseases that were not incapacitating. \"The hypothesis that chiropractic care maintains the immune system is supported by the observation that, even though the children did have the disease, their lifestyles were not affected and the recovery periods were short.\" 12. Comments from medical pediatri cians indicate that a number of them believe that, essentially, all children suffer from otitis media and that all children have at least one course of prescribed antibiotics. \"These are fallacies propagated within allopathic medicine, as demonstrated by this study.\" 13. \"This study has shown that there is validity in the premise that chiroprac- tic has a positive effect on the health status of individuals.\" The results of this study confirm the benefits of the chiropractic model of health care on the health status of children.
