With solid data, the new information dispels the international community's doubts about the Chinese economy and provides much-needed heat for the world economy in a winter of recovery. The Chinese economy is performing smoothly. The GDP for the first quarter was over 27 trillion RMB, up 4.8 percent year on year and ranking the highest among the world's major economies. The value-added of industries above a designated scale grew by 6.5 percent year on year, a growth rate that's 2.6 percentage points higher the previous quarter. The CPI rose by 1.1 percent year on year, which is below the expected target of around 3 percent. The national surveyed urban unemployment rate averaged 5.5 percent, which is basically on par with the same period last year. Foreign exchange reserves remained stable at around 3.2 trillion US dollars. Imports and exports of goods grew by 7.5 percent and 13.4 percent year on year respectively, and paid-in foreign investment increased by 25.6 percent year on year. The Chinese economy is driven more by innovation. The value-added for high-tech and equipment manufacturing industries increased by 14.2 percent and 8.1 percent respectively. The value-added of the information transmission, software and information technology service industry increased by 10.8 percent. The value-added of consumer goods manufacturing industry increased by 8.1 percent year on year. Online retail sales of physical goods grew by 8.8 percent year on year. This number continues to grow on top of an already high base and it now accounts for 23.2 percent of China's total retail sales of consumer goods. The output of new energy vehicles and solar cells increased by 140.8 percent and 24.3 percent respectively. The share of clean energy consumption such as natural gas, water, nuclear and wind power increased by 0.8 percentage points over the previous year, and energy consumption each 10,000 yuan of GDP decreased by 2.3 percent year on year. China maintains a reasonable policy orientation in managing the macro economy. Faced with changes unseen in a century of changes and a major pandemic, China's economic policy is anchored by a principle of stability and steady progress. The focus has been on a balance between COVID-19 response and socioeconomic development. Cross- and counter-cyclical adjustments with macro policies have been strengthened. Consistent efforts have been made in various areas including stronger employment, consumption, investment, openness and people's livelihood. Efforts on all these fronts helped to ensure that on a general note, the Chinese economy this year is off to a sound start. China's CPI rose 1.5 percent year on year in March. The general price levels remained stable, which provides more room for proactive macro policies. The fiscal deficit identified in China's government budget for 2022 is only about 2.8 percent of GDP. The pressure on fiscal spending is relatively small, which left some room for further adjustment as the government delivers relevant policies. China's economic development will continue to benefit African countries including South Africa. China is now the world's second-largest economy, NO.1 trader in goods, NO.1 manufacturing powerhouse, holder of the largest foreign exchange reserves, the second-largest consumer market and the recipient of the second-largest FDI inflows. An International Financial Forum (IFF) report forecasts that China will remain the largest contributor to global economic growth, accounting for 26.3 percent of world growth in 2021. China has remained Africa's top trading partner for 12 consecutive years. China is also a major source of FDI for Africa. In the first quarter, data from the General Administration of Customs of China showed that China-Africa trade reached 64.86 billion US dollars, up 23 percent year on year. Among this volume, China's exports to Africa totaled 35.16 billion US dollars, up 18.2 percent year on year, and China's imports from Africa reached 29.69 billion US dollars, up 29.3 percent year on year. Trade between China and South Africa reached 12.29 billion US dollars, up 13.5 percent year on year. Among that, China's exports to South Africa topped 5.28 billion US dollars, up 23.7 percent year on year, while China's imports from South Africa reached 7.01 billion US dollars, up 6.9 percent year on year. COVID-19 and the Ukraine situation do pose increased risks and challenges. For countries including South Africa, there are more complexity, severity and uncertainty in economic development. New challenges are also there in terms of pursuing stable growth, steady employment and stable prices. China will fully apply its new development philosophy, accelerate the establishment of a new development paradigm, and redouble efforts for high-quality development. No matter how the world will change, China's faith in and its commitment to reform and opening-up will not waver. China will expand high-standard opening-up, fully implement the negative list for foreign investment, expand the encouraged catalogue for FDI, improve services for investment promotion, and add more cities to the comprehensive pilot program for service sector opening. The fundamentals of the Chinese economy \u2014 its strong resilience, enormous potential, vast room for maneuver and long-term sustainability \u2014 remain unchanged. They will provide great dynamism for the stability and recovery of the world economy and broader market opportunities for all countries. That also means more benefits will be provided for people of all countries including South Africa. "}
