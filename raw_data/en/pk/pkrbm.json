These include chronic pain syndromes, anxiety, depression, digestive complaints, insomnia and many more. What Are the Benefits? Acupuncture works on some of the same [principles as chiropractic adjustment](/chiropractic-care/) in that it helps to bring about balance to the systems of the body. If a person is sick or in a state of dis-ease there is an imbalance in the meridians of their body and/or their nervous system. Acupuncture can help to bring balance back to their system and promote healing. This allows the body to regulate, digest and eliminate the way it was designed. Acupuncture helps to bring them back to center. What About Those Needles? Understandably many people have a concern about the needles used in acupuncture. They wonder if it will hurt. The good news is the needles used are quite small, the size of a hair filament. You typically don't feel much except perhaps a mild tugging sensation where the needles are placed. Electrical Acupuncture Available Dislike needles? We also provide electrical acupuncture that doesn't pierce the skin with a needle but uses a brass-tipped electrode that contacts the acupuncture point. The benefit of using this technique to stimulate the acupuncture points electronically is it produces the same neurologic effect as traditional needle acupuncture. Those with pain syndromes or intense nerve injuries find that electrical acupuncture has been showing excellent results. Please note that those who have had a pacemaker or any type of electrical device implanted will need to have traditional needle acupuncture, as we can't use electrical acupuncture on these patients. You first will need to [complete some initial paperwork](/new-patient-forms/) and then we will [provide a free consultation](/new-patient-center/). If Dr. Good thinks your condition can be helped with acupuncture, he can provide care. First, however, we will start with an initial examination, just as we would with a traditional chiropractic case. [Dr. Good will perform some different tests](/dr-william-good/) and exam techniques to look at specific muscle groups and different structural indicators that are going on. Based on what he finds, Dr. Good can provide treatment the same day to provide as much relief as possible while you're here. If you're getting traditional acupuncture treatment, he will insert the needles and leave you in a quiet, relaxing room to rest while the acupuncture does the work. In the case of electrical acupuncture, Dr. Good will be in the room with you to do the manipulation and stimulation at the same time. After your session, we will have you schedule your next appointment. [Do acupuncture and chiropractic complement each other?](#toggle-1) Yes, acupuncture has been a fantastic adjunct to chiropractic as it reduces pain levels fast, and then allows the chiropractic and the acupuncture to work together at restoring nerve tone. [Should I prepare for my appointment in any way?](#toggle-2) We just recommend that you wear comfortable clothing that will allow Dr. Good to access the various points on your body to place the needles. [Do I need to be a chiropractic patient to receive acupuncture?](#toggle-3) No, you can book an appointment just for acupuncture. However, if you get a chiropractic adjustment and acupuncture, we do discount the acupuncture. [Does insurance cover acupuncture?](#toggle-4) It depends. Some insurance companies do cover a portion. Generally speaking though, acupuncture is seen as an out-of-pocket service with a fee of $60. Visit Us Today Contact [Good Health Chiropractic & Acupuncture](/about-us/) today to schedule an "}
