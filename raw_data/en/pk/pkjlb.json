The guidelines below are designed to help you navigate these complex circumstances. Update: Effective August 5, 2023, the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid (CMS) have ended the COVID-19 vaccination requirement for healthcare workers. Healthcare workers will no longer be required to obtain COVID-19 vaccination. [More information can be found here.](https://www.cms.gov/medicareprovider-enrollment-and-certificationsurveycertificationgeninfopolicy-and-memos-states-and/revised-guidance-staff-vaccination-requirements) Students are no longer required to attest to their COVID-19 vaccination status. In-person classes: Classes will continue in-person as scheduled. Masks: Effective April 3, 2023, the California Department of Public Health ended the COVID-19 indoor masking policies in high-risk and healthcare settings. Staff, visitors, and patients in these settings are no longer required to mask while indoors. As part of providing clinical care, we want to respect our patients' choices, and if they would like their healthcare providers to wear a mask, we ask you to do so. For those who would like to continue to wear a mask, you may also do so. Please contact Student Health Service with any questions or concerns. COVID-19 Vaccines: COVID-19 vaccines are available by scheduling an appointment via [My Turn](http://myturn.ca.gov/). Students who need a COVID-19 vaccine should schedule an appointment via [My Turn](https://myturn.ca.gov/). International students vaccinated outside of the United States should refer [to Interim Clinical Considerations for Use of COVID-19 Vaccines Currently Authorized in the United States](https://www.cdc.gov/vaccines/covid-19/clinical-considerations/covid-19-vaccines-us.html?CDC_AA_refVal=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.cdc.gov%2Fvaccines%2Fcovid-19%2Finfo-by-product%2Fclinical-considerations.html) for the need for vaccinations upon arrival in the United States. Student Health Service provides care for students who are located in the state of California. Students located outside California should consult their primary care provider in their home state. Students should stay home if they have any of the following symptoms (not including a chronic medical condition such as migraines, asthma, IBS/colitis, or premenstrual syndrome): If you have COVID-like symptoms, Student Health Service serves as your primary care location. Please call the office at [909-558-8770](tel:9095588770) for a video visit. Do not come in person for symptom assessment. Be sure to proactively limit your contact with others until you have contacted Student Health Service for determination of whether isolation is needed. The California Department of Public Health (CDPH) has issued new guidance on reporting suspected COVID-19 infections for students enrolled in clinical rotations. We are required to report this information to CDPH on an ongoing basis. LLUH's COVID-19 exposure definition has been updated. The definition of close contact (in the context of exposure) is as follows: *The following are sites on campus that are greater than 400,000 cubic feet: All students who suspect they have been exposed should follow [Student Exposure to COVID-19 Algorithm (12/05/2022)](/sites/llu.edu/files/2022-12/2022-12-05-exposure-algorithm-all-students.pdf). Student Health Service is responsible for case investigation and contact tracing for all students. When Student Health Service is notified that someone has tested positive for or been diagnosed with COVID-19, Student Health Service communicates exposure locations on our website: [llu.edu/covid-19-info-cases](https://llu.edu/covid-19-info-cases). COVID-19 testing is available to all students through [Student Health Service](https://llu.edu/campus-and-spiritual-life/student-health-service). Free testing is available through [San Bernardino County](https://sbcovid19.com/covidtesting/). Check for symptoms: Students should perform daily health screenings for infectious illnesses (including COVID-19) before they arrive to campus and/or clinical rotations. Students with signs or symptoms of infectious illness should stay home, isolate away from others, and call Student Health Service to schedule a video visit at [909-558-8770](tel:9095588770). Keep track of exposures: Students who have had close contact with a known/suspected COVID-19 case should follow the [Student Exposure to COVID-19 Algorithm (12/05/2022)](/sites/llu.edu/files/2022-12/2022-12-05-exposure-algorithm-all-students.pdf). Consider your medical conditions: Students with [certain medical conditions identified by the CDC](https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/need-extra-precautions/people-with-medical-conditions.html) may be more likely to get severely ill from COVID-19. Students with high-risk conditions are encouraged to make an appointment with Student Health Service at [909-558-8770](tel:9095588770) to discuss any questions or concerns. International Students (meaning non-citizens on LLU-sponsored student visas) should inform the International Student and Scholar Services (ISSS) of their arrival date in the U.S. as soon as their travel itinerary has finalized. Please contact ISSS by emailing [intlstdsrv@llu.edu](mailto:intlstdsrv@llu.edu) or calling [909-558-4955](tel:9095584955). For more information related to travel during the COVID-19 Pandemic, please monitor [CDC](https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/travelers/international-travel-during-covid19.html) and [CDPH](https://www.cdph.ca.gov/Programs/CID/DCDC/Pages/Immunization/ncov2019.aspx) guidance. International travelers living on-campus in the residence halls should contact and inform their facility dean of their arrival date to the U.S (or provide a copy of their flight itinerary). International students vaccinated outside of the United States should refer [to Interim Clinical Considerations for Use of COVID-19 Vaccines Currently Authorized in the United States](https://www.cdc.gov/vaccines/covid-19/clinical-considerations/interim-considerations-us-appendix.html#appendix-a) for the need for vaccinations upon arrival in the U.S. The [California Department of Public Health (CDPH) guidance for isolation and quarantine](https://www.cdph.ca.gov/Programs/CID/DCDC/Pages/COVID-19/Guidance-on-Isolation-and-Quarantine-for-COVID-19-Contact-Tracing.aspx) is divided into different categories for clearance, including consideration for whether you are in the general public OR working in a healthcare setting (this applies to students on clinical rotations). Please report symptoms and confirmed COVID-19 infections, and high-risk exposures to Student Health Service. Email us at [COVID19_Student_Health@llu.edu](mailto:COVID19_Student_Health@llu.edu) or call [909-558-8770](tel:9095588770).
