Harris, MD Memorial Integrative Health Care Series TWIG Auditorium Rochester General Hospital JOINTLY SPONSORED BY Schedule of Events Course Introduction INTEGRA TIVE MEDICINE has been designated as a board specialty as of 2014. The field focuses on the whole person, mind-body-spirit, and acknowledges that the relationship between patient and provider in itself can be healing.
