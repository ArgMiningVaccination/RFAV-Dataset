Wu, MD, PhD Albert Y. Wu, MD, PhD, is currently an Assistant Professor in the Departments of Ophthalmology and Medical Education at the Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai. He graduated from Yale University with a Bachelor of Science in Molecular Biophysics and Biochemistry, and immediately began the Medical Scientist Training Program (MSTP) at the University of Washington. His PhD was in the area of cyclic nucleotide phosphodiesterases), where he was trained by National Academy of Sciences member, Joseph Beavo. Dr. Wu then finished ophthalmology residency at the Moran Eye Center in Salt Lake City, followed by a two year Oculoplastics Fellowship at the University of Toronto. During fellowship, he worked in the laboratory of William Stanford at the Centre for Modeling Human Disease learning how to use induced pluripotent stem cells. Dr. Wu came to the Icahn School of Medicine in 2014 and was awarded a five-year NIH grant to restore a patient's damaged cornea with stem cells. Using recent breakthroughs in pluripotent stem cells technology, Dr. Wu and his team are creating eye stem cells, which may transform the care and outcomes of patients blind from burns or trauma. Furthermore, these cells could enhance the therapy of other ocular disorders that could benefit from regeneration, as well as skin burns, injured tissues, and stroke. On a broader level, this research could serve as a paradigm for the creation of other transplantable tissue for use throughout the body. These studies will serve as the basis for human clinical trials and make regenerative medicine a reality for those with sight-threatening disease. 47THE DR. HAROLD AND GOLDEN LAMPORT RESEARCH AWARDS Priti Balchandani, PhD Priti Balchandani, PhD, received her Honours Bachelor of Applied Science in Computer Engineering at the University of Waterloo in Canada and her Doctor of Philosophy in Electrical Engineering at Stanford University. As the Director of the High Field MRI program at the Translational and Molecular Imaging Institute (TMII) at the Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai (ISMMS), Dr. Balchandani focuses on developing novel techniques to exploit the power of high-field MR magnets to visualize the brain in unprecedented detail. She leads a team of scientists to devise creative engineering methods to overcome some of the main limitations of operating at high magnetic fields, thereby enabling high-resolution whole-brain anatomical, spectroscopic and diffusion imaging as well as unlocking new contrast mechanisms and sources of signal. In order to achieve these goals, Dr. Balchandani's team focuses on novel radio frequency (RF) pulse and pulse sequence design as well as specialized hardware solutions such as parallel transmission. These techniques are ultimately applied to improve diagnosis, treatment and surgical planning for neurological diseases and disorders. Some clinical areas of focus for Dr. Balchandani's team are improved localization of epileptogenic foci and development of imaging methods to better guide neurosurgical resection of brain tumors. Her work has resulted in several peer-reviewed publications and U.S. patents as well as selection as a finalist for the International Society for Magnetic Resonance in Medicine (ISMRM) 2008 Young Investigator Award. She was also named a Junior Fellow of the ISMRM. She is the recipient of a K99/R00 NIH Pathway to Independence Award from the National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke. In 2016, Dr. Balchandani was awarded an R01 grant from the National Cancer Institute. Dr. Balchandani is very thankful to her mentors at Stanford and ISMMS, particularly Dr. Zahi Fayad, Director of TMII, for his valuable support and guidance during her time as faculty. 48 Kristen Brennand, PhD Kristen Brennand, PhD, is an Assistant Professor of Psychiatry at the Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai. She trained in Developmental and Stem Cell Biology at Harvard University and in Neurobiology during postdoctoral at the Salk Institute for Biological Studies. By combining expertise in both, she has pioneered a new approach by which to study psychiatric disease. Dr. Brennand's work is funded by the National Institutes of Health, the New York Stem Cell Foundation and the Brain and Behavior Research Foundation. To investigate how neurons from patients with schizophrenia differ from those from healthy controls, they obtain skin samples from patients, which are then reprogrammed into induced pluripotent stem cells, and subsequently differentiated into precise subtypes of human neurons. This has allowed her group to begin to ask how and why neurons derived from schizophrenia patients differ from those derived from controls. The goal of their research is to not just understand the genetic mechanisms contributing to schizophrenia, but ultimately to develop a screening platform that we can use to identify new therapeutics for the treatment of this debilitating disorder.49 Jennifer Jao, MD Dual certified in Internal Medicine and Pediatrics, Dr. Jao is an Infectious Disease specialist whose research focus is HIV maternal child health. She obtained her Bachelor of Arts in French Literature at Tulane University and Doctor of Medicine at the Medical College of Georgia. She went on to complete a Medicine/Pediatrics residency at Rush University Medical Center in Chicago and her Infectious Disease Fellowship along with her Master of Public Health at the Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai. Dr. Jao has led cohorts of HIV-infected pregnant women and their children both in the United States and Africa, and as a translational researcher, her research portfolio targets the long-term metabolic effects of in utero exposure to HIV and antiretroviral medications. She is the Principal Investigator on NIH-funded studies in the U.S. and Africa to better understand the long-term health outcomes of HIV- exposed infants, and is the lead investigator on several studies within the NIH-funded Pediatric HIV/AIDS Cohort Study and the National Institute of Child Health and Human Development International Site Development Initiative. She serves on the Board of Directors of Research for Health, a non- profit organization whose mission it is to strengthen research capacity in resource-constrained settings as well as the Cameroon Baptist Convention Health Services Internal Medicine Residency Advisory Board. 50 Sarah Stanley, MBBCh, PhD Sarah A. Stanley, MBBCh, PhD, joined the Diabetes, Obesity and Metabolism Institute of the Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai in 2015 as Assistant Professor with a joint appointment in the Department of Neuroscience. Her research interests are at the intersection of three areas: pioneering the use of radio waves and magnetic fields to non- invasively modulate individual cells and neurons, use of nanoparticles for preclinical applications and advancing the understanding of the interaction between central nervous system in metabolic disease to find new approaches to diabetes treatment. Dr. Stanley studied medicine at Cambridge University, with clinical training at busy London teaching hospitals and was an attending physician in Endocrinology and General Medicine at The Hammersmith Hospital. She studied for a PhD as a Wellcome Trust Fellow in the laboratory of Professor Sir Steven Bloom and then joined Professor Jeffrey Friedman's laboratory at Rockefeller University as post-doctoral fellow before moving to the Icahn School of Medicine.51Closing Remarks David Muller, MD Marietta and Charles C.
