Notes 1 Evidence of Coverage (EOC): The Evidence of Coverage (EOC) describes the Benefits, limitations, and exclusions that apply to coverage under this Plan. Please review the EOC for more details of coverage outlined in this Summary of Benefits. You can request a copy of the EOC at any time. Capitalized terms are defined in the EOC. Refer to the EOC for an explanation of the terms used in this Summary of Benefits. 2 Calendar Year Deductible (CYD): Calendar Year Deductible explained. A Calendar Year Deductible is the amount you pay each Calendar Year before Blue Shield pays for Covered Services under the Plan. If this Plan has any Calendar Year Deductible(s), Covered Services subject to that Deductible are identified with a check mark () in the Benefits chart above. Covered Services not subject to the Calendar Year combined medical and pharmacy Deductible. Some Covered Services received from Participating Providers are paid by Blue Shield before you meet any Calendar Year combined medical and pharmacy Deductible. These Covered Services do not have a check mark () next to them in the \"CYD applies\" column in the Benefits chart above. This Plan has a separate Participating Provider Deductible and Non-Participating Provider Deductible.12Notes Family coverage has an individual Deductible within the Family Deductible. This means that the Deductible will be met for an individual with Family coverage who meets the individual Deductible prior to the Family meeting the Family Deductible within a Calendar Year. Once the individual Deductible or Family Deductible is reached, cost sharing applies until the Out-of-Pocket Maximum is reached. 3 Using Participating Providers: Participating Providers have a contract to provide health care services to Members. When you receive Covered Services from a Participating Provider, you are only responsible for the Copayment or Coinsurance, once any Calendar Year Deductible has been met. Teladoc. Teladoc mental health and substance use disorder consultations are provided through Teladoc. These services are not administered by Blue Shield's Mental Health Service Administrator (MHSA). \"Allowable Amount\" is defined in the EOC. In addition: Coinsurance is calculated from the Allowable Amount. 4 Using Non-Participating Providers: Non-Participating Providers do not have a contract to provide health care services to Members. When you receive Covered Services from a Non-Participating Provider, you are responsible for: the Copayment or Coinsurance (once any Calendar Year Deductible has been met), and any charges above the Allowable Amount. \"Allowable Amount\" is defined in the EOC. In addition: Coinsurance is calculated from the Allowable Amount, which is subject to any stated Benefit maximum. Charges above the Allowable Amount do not count towards the Out-of-Pocket Maximum, and are your responsibility for payment to the provider. This out-of-pocket expense can be significant. 5 Calendar Year Out-of-Pocket Maximum (OOPM): Calendar Year Out-of-Pocket Maximum explained. The Out-of-Pocket Maximum is the most you are required to pay for Covered Services in a Calendar Year. Once you reach your Out-of-Pocket Maximum, Blue Shield will pay 100% of the Allowable Amount for Covered Services for the rest of the Calendar Year. Your payment after you reach the Calendar Year OOPM. You will continue to pay all charges for services that are not covered and charges above the Allowable Amount. Any Deductibles count towards the OOPM. Any amounts you pay that count towards the Calendar Year combined medical and pharmacy Deductible also count towards the Calendar Year Out-of-Pocket Maximum. This Plan has a separate Participating Provider OOPM and Non-Participating Provider OOPM. Covered Drugs obtained at Non-Participating Pharmacies. Any amounts you pay for Covered Drugs at Non- Participating Pharmacies count towards the Participating Provider OOPM. Family coverage has an individual OOPM within the Family OOPM. This means that the OOPM will be met for an individual with Family coverage who meets the individual OOPM prior to the Family meeting the Family OOPM within a Calendar Year. 6 Separate Member Payments When Multiple Covered Services are Received: Each time you receive multiple Covered Services, you might have separate payments (Copayment or Coinsurance) for each service. When this happens, you may be responsible for multiple Copayments or Coinsurance. For example, you may owe an office visit payment in addition to an allergy serum payment when you visit the doctor for an allergy shot.13Notes 7 Preventive Health Services: If you only receive Preventive Health Services during a Physician office visit, there is no Copayment or Coinsurance for the visit by a Participating Provider. If you receive both Preventive Health Services and other Covered Services during the Physician office visit, you may have a Copayment or Coinsurance for the visit. 8 Outpatient Prescription Drug Coverage: Medicare Part D-creditable coverage- This Plan's prescription drug coverage is on average equivalent to or better than the standard benefit set by the federal government for Medicare Part D (also called creditable coverage). Because this plan's prescription drug coverage is creditable, you do not have to enroll in Medicare Part D while you maintain this coverage; however, you should be aware that if you do not enroll in Medicare Part D within 63 days following termination of this coverage, you could be subject to Medicare Part D premium penalties. 9 Outpatient Prescription Drug Coverage: Brand Drug coverage when a Generic Drug is available. If you select a Brand Drug when a Generic Drug equivalent is available, you are responsible for the difference between the cost to Blue Shield for the Brand Drug and its Generic Drug equivalent plus the tier 1 Copayment or Coinsurance. This difference in cost will not count towards any Calendar Year pharmacy Deductible, medical Deductible, or the Calendar Year Out-of-Pocket Maximum. If your Physician or Health Care Provider prescribes a Brand Drug and indicates that a Generic Drug equivalent should not be substituted, you pay your applicable tier Copayment or Coinsurance. If your Physician or Health Care Provider does not indicate that a Generic Drug equivalent should not be substituted, you may request a Medical Necessity Review. If approved, the Brand Drug will be covered at the applicable Drug tier Copayment or Coinsurance. Short-Cycle Specialty Drug program. This program allows initial prescriptions for select Specialty Drugs to be filled for a 15-day supply with your approval. When this occurs, the Copayment or Coinsurance will be pro-rated. Specialty Drugs. Specialty Drugs are only available from a Network Specialty Pharmacy, up to a 30-day supply. Oral Anticancer Drugs. After the Deductible is met, you pay up to $250 for oral Anticancer Drugs from a Participating Pharmacy, up to a 30-day supply. High Deductible Health Plan (HDHP) preventive Drugs. HDHP preventive Drugs obtained from a Participating Pharmacy are covered at the applicable Drug tier Copayment but are not subject to the Deductible. HDHP preventive Drugs do not include those preventive Drugs that are required by Health Care Reform to be covered at no charge. Visit blueshieldca.com/pharmacy for lists of these Drugs.14 Questions?

Health care professionals and facilities This plan covers care from Participating Providers and Non-Participating Providers. You do not need a referral. However, some services do require prior authorization. See the Medical Management Programs section for information about prior authorization. Participating Providers Participating Providers have a contract with Blue Shield and agree to accept Blue Shield's Allowable Amount as payment in full for Covered Services. As a result, your Cost Share is less when you receive Covered Services from a Participating Provider. Some services will not be covered unless you receive them from a Participating Provider. See the Summary of Benefits section to find out which Covered Services must be received from a Participating Provider. If a provider leaves this plan's network, the status of the provider will change from Participating to Non-Participating. Visit blueshieldca.com or use the Blue Shield mobile app and click on Find a Doctor for a list of your plan's Participating Providers. Non-Participating Providers Non-Participating Providers do not have a contract with Blue Shield to accept Blue Shield's Allowable Amount as payment in full for Covered Services. Except for Emergency Services and services received at a Participating Provider facility (Hospital, Ambulatory Surgery Center, laboratory, radiology center, imaging center, or certain other outpatient settings) under certain conditions, you will pay more for Covered Services from a Non-Participating Provider. Non-Participating Providers at a Participating Provider facility When you receive care at a Participating Provider facility, some Covered Services may be provided by a Non-Participating Provider. Your Cost Share will be the same as the amount due to a Participating Provider under similar circumstances, and you will not be responsible for additional charges above the Allowable Amount, unless the Non-Participating Provider provides you written notice of what they may charge and you consent to those terms.

For the lowest out-of-pocket expenses, you can go to a Participating Physician's office for emergency room follow-up services, such as suture removal and wound checks. If you cannot find a Participating Provider Call Customer Service if you need help finding a Participating Provider who can provide the care you need close to home. If a Participating Provider is not available, you can ask to see a Non-Participating Provider at the Participating Provider Cost Share.

Care management and palliative care can help you access the care you need to manage serious health conditions and complex treatment plans. For written information about Blue Shield's Utilization Management Program, visit blueshieldca.com. Prior authorization Coverage for some Benefits requires pre-approval from Blue Shield. This process is called prior authorization. Prior authorization requests are reviewed for Medical Necessity, available plan Benefits, and clinically appropriate setting. The prior authorization process also identifies Benefits that are only covered from Participating Providers or in a specific clinical setting. If you see a Participating Provider, your provider must obtain prior authorization when required. When prior authorization is required but not obtained, Blue Shield may deny payment to your provider. You are not responsible for Blue Shield's portion of the Allowable Amount if this occurs, only your Cost Share. If you see a Non-Participating Provider, you or your provider must obtain prior authorization when required. When prior authorization is required but not obtained, and the services provided are determined not to be a Benefit of the plan or Medically Necessary, Blue Shield may deny payment and you will be responsible for all billed charges. You do not need prior authorization for Emergency Services or emergency Hospital admissions at Participating or Non-Participating facilities. For non-emergency inpatient services, your provider should request prior authorization at least five business days before admission. Visit blueshieldca.com and click on Prior Authorization List for more details about medical and surgical services and select prescription Drugs that require prior authorization.

Exceptions to inpatient utilization review include maternity and mastectomy care. For maternity, the minimum length of an inpatient stay is 48 hours for a normal, vaginal delivery and 96 hours for a C-section.

Blue Shield will work with you, your provider, and the Hospital's discharge planners to determine the most appropriate and cost-effective way to provide this care.

This monthly payment is a Premium. Any amount the Subscriber must contribute to the Premium is set by your Employer. The contract states the monthly Premiums for this plan for the Subscriber and any enrolled Dependents. Paying for Covered Services Your Cost Share is the amount you pay for Covered Services. It is your portion of the Blue Shield Allowable Amount. Your Cost Share includes any: Deductible; Copayment amount; and Coinsurance amount. See the Summary of Benefits section for your Cost Share for Covered Services. Allowable Amount The Allowable Amount is the maximum amount Blue Shield will pay for Covered Services, or the provider's billed charge for those Covered Services, whichever is less. Blue Shield's payment to the provider is the difference between the Allowable Amount and your Cost Share. Participating Providers agree to accept the Allowable Amount as payment in full for Covered Services, except as stated in the Exception for other coverage and Reductions - third party liability sections. When you see a Participating Provider, you are responsible for your Cost Share. Generally, Blue Shield will pay its portion of the Allowable Amount and you will pay your Cost Share. If there is a payment dispute between Blue Shield and a Participating Provider over Covered Services you receive, the Participating Provider must resolve that dispute with Blue Shield. You are not required to pay for Blue Shield's portion of the Allowable Amount. You are only required to pay your Cost Share for those services. Non-Participating Providers do not agree to accept the Allowable Amount as payment in full for Covered Services. When you see a Non-Participating Provider, you are responsible for: Your Cost Share; and All charges over the Allowable Amount.Your payment information 34 Questions? Visit blueshieldca.com, use the Blue Shield mobile app, or call Customer Service at 1-855-599- 2650.Calendar Year Deductible The Deductible is the amount you pay each Calendar Year for Covered Services before Blue Shield begins payment. Blue Shield will pay for some Covered Services before you meet your Deductible. Amounts you pay toward your Deductible count toward your Out-of-Pocket Maximum. Some plans do not have a Deductible. For plans that do, there may be separate Deductibles for: An individual Member and an entire Family; Participating Providers and Non-Participating Providers; and Medical and pharmacy Benefits. If you have a Family plan, there is an individual Deductible within the Family Deductible. This means an individual family member can meet the individual Deductible before the entire Family meets the Family Deductible. If you have an individual plan and you enroll a Dependent, your plan will become a Family plan. Any amount you have paid toward the Deductible for your individual plan will be applied to both the individual Deductible and the Family Deductible for your new plan. See the Summary of Benefits section for details on which Covered Services are subject to the Deductible and how the Deductible works for your plan. Prior carrier Deductible credit If you pay all or part of a Deductible for another Employer-sponsored health plan in the same Calendar Year you enroll in this plan, that amount will be applied to this plan's Deductible if: You were enrolled in an Employer-sponsored health plan with another carrier during the same Calendar Year this contract becomes effective and you enroll as of the original effective date of coverage under this contract; You were enrolled in another Blue Shield plan sponsored by the same Employer which this plan is replacing; or You were enrolled in another Blue Shield plan sponsored by the same Employer and you are transferring to this plan during open enrollment. Copayment and Coinsurance A Covered Service may have a Copayment or a Coinsurance. A Copayment is a specific dollar amount you pay for a Covered Service. A Coinsurance is a percentage of the Allowable Amount you pay for a Covered Service. Your provider will ask you to pay your Copayment or Coinsurance at the time of service. For Covered Services that are subject to your plan's Deductible, you are also responsible for all costs up to the Allowable Amount until you reach your Deductible. You will continue to pay the Copayment or Coinsurance for each Covered Service you receive until you reach your Out-of-Pocket Maximum.Your payment information 35 Questions? Visit blueshieldca.com, use the Blue Shield mobile app, or call Customer Service at 1-855-599- 2650.Calendar Year Out-of-Pocket Maximum The Out-of-Pocket Maximum is the most you are required to pay in Cost Share for Covered Services in a Calendar Year. Your Cost Share includes Deductible, Copayment, and Coinsurance and these amounts count toward your Out-of-Pocket Maximum, except as listed below. Once you reach your Out-of-Pocket Maximum, Blue Shield will pay 100% of the Allowable Amount for Covered Services for the rest of the Calendar Year. If you want information about your Out-of-Pocket Maximum, you can call Customer Service. Some plans may have a separate Out-of-Pocket Maximum for: An individual Member and an entire Family; Participating Providers and Non-Participating Providers; and Participating Providers and combined Participating and Non-Participating Providers. If you have a Family plan, there is an individual Out-of-Pocket Maximum within the Family Out-of-Pocket Maximum. This means an individual family member can meet the individual Out-of-Pocket Maximum before the entire Family meets the Family Out-of-Pocket Maximum. If you have an individual plan and you enroll a Dependent, your plan will become a Family plan. Any amount you have paid toward the Out-of-Pocket Maximum for your individual plan will be applied to both the individual Out-of-Pocket Maximum and the Family Out-of-Pocket Maximum for your new plan. The following do not count toward your Out-of-Pocket Maximum: Charges for services that are not covered; and Charges over the Allowable Amount. You will continue to be responsible for these costs even after you reach your Out-of- Pocket Maximum. See the Summary of Benefits section for details on how the Out-of-Pocket Maximum works for your plan. Accrual balance Blue Shield provides a summary of your accrual balances toward your Calendar Year Deductible, if any, and Out-of-Pocket Maximum for every month in which your Benefits were used until the full amount has been met. This summary will be mailed to you unless you opt to receive it electronically or have already opted out of paper mailings. You can opt back in to receive paper mailings at any time or elect to receive your balance summary electronically by logging into your member portal online and updating your communication preferences, or by calling Customer Service at the number on the back of your ID card. You can also check your accrual balances at any time by logging into your member portal online, which is updated daily, or calling Customer Service.

Deductible: $500 Amount Copayment: $30 Non-Participating the doctor's visit: Non-Participating Provider billed charge for the ($40 Copayment plus $40 for charges over Allowable Amount) Blue Shield pays $70 (Allowable Amount minus your Cost Share)$60 (Allowable Amount minus your Cost Share) Total payment to the doctor$100 (Allowable Amount)$140 (Billed charge) In this example, because you have already met your Deductible, you are responsible for: Participating Provider: the Copayment; or Non-Participating Provider: the Copayment plus all charges over the Allowable Amount.Your payment information 37 Questions?

If you select a Brand Drug when a Generic Drug equivalent is available, you pay the difference in cost, plus the Tier 1 Copayment or Coinsurance. This is calculated by taking the difference between the Participating Pharmacy's contracted rate for the Brand Drug and the Generic Drug equivalent, plus the Tier 1 Copayment or Coinsurance. For example, you select Brand Drug A when there is an equivalent Generic Drug A available. The Participating Pharmacy's contracted rate for Brand Drug A is $300 and the contracted rate for Generic Drug A is $100. You would be responsible for paying the $200 difference in cost, plus the Tier 1 Copayment or Coinsurance. This difference in cost does not apply to your Deductible or your Out- of-Pocket Maximum responsibility. If your Physician or Health Care Provider does not indicate that a Generic Drug equivalent should not be substituted, you can request an exception to paying the difference in cost between the Brand Drug and Generic Drug equivalent through the Blue Shield prior authorization process. The request is reviewed for Medical Necessity. See the Prior authorization/exception request/step therapy process section for more information on the prior authorization process and exception requests. If the request is approved, you pay only the applicable tier Copayment or Coinsurance. Blue Shield created a Patient Review and Coordination (PRC) program to help reduce harmful prescription drug misuse and the potential for abuse. Examples of harmful misuse include obtaining an excessive number of prescription medications or obtaining very high doses of prescription opioids from multiple providers or pharmacies within a 90-day period. If Blue Shield determines a Member is using prescription drugs in a potentially harmful, abusive manner, Blue Shield may, subject to certain exemptions and upon 90 days' advance notice, restrict a Member to obtaining all non-emergent outpatient prescriptions drugs at a single pharmacy home. This restriction applies for a 12-month period and may be renewed. The pharmacy home, a single Participating Pharmacy, will be assigned by Blue Shield or a Member may request to select a pharmacy home. Blue Shield may also require prior authorization for all opioid medications if sufficient medical justification for their use has not been provided. Members that disagree with their enrollment in the PRC program can file an appeal or submit a grievance to Blue Shield as described in the Grievance Process section. Members selected for participation in the PRC will receive a brochure with full program details, including participation exemptions. Any interested Member can request a PRC program brochure by calling Customer Service at the number listed on their Identification Card.Your Benefits 67 Questions?

If the request does not include all necessary supporting information, Blue Shield will notify the requestor within 72 hours in routine circumstances or within 24 hours in exigent circumstances. Once Blue Shield receives all required supporting information, Blue Shield will provide prior authorization approval or denial within 72 hours of receipt in routine circumstances or 24 hours in exigent circumstances. Exigent circumstances exist when you have a health condition that may seriously jeopardize your life, health, or ability to regain maximum function, or you are undergoing a current course of treatment using a non-Formulary Drug.

Once all required supporting information is received, Blue Shield will approve or deny the exception request, based on Medical Necessity, within 72 hours in routine circumstances or 24 hours in exigent circumstances. Step therapy is the process of beginning therapy for a medical condition with Drugs considered first-line treatment or that are more cost-effective, then progressing to Drugs that are the next line in treatment or that may be less cost-effective. Step therapy requirements are based on how the FDA recommends that a Drug should be used, nationally recognized treatment guidelines, medical studies, information from the Drug manufacturer, and the relative cost of treatment for a condition. If your Physician or Health Care Provider believes that step therapy coverage requirements for a prescription need not be met and that the Drug is Medically Necessary, the step therapy exception process must be used and timeframes Your Benefits 69 Questions?

California Department of Managed Health Care review The California Department of Managed Health Care is responsible for regulating health care service plans. If you have a grievance against your health plan, you should first telephone your health plan at 1-855-599-2650 and use your health plan's grievance process before contacting the Department. Utilizing this grievance procedure does not prohibit any potential legal rights or remedies that may be available to you. If you need help with a grievance involving an emergency, a grievance that has not been satisfactorily resolved by your health plan, or a grievance that has remained unresolved for more than 30 days, you may call the Department for assistance. You may also be eligible for an Independent Medical Review (IMR). If you are eligible for IMR, the IMR process will provide an impartial review of medical decisions made by a health plan related to the Medical Necessity of a proposed service or treatment, coverage decisions for treatments that are Experimental or Investigational, and payment disputes for emergency or urgent medical services. The Department also has a toll-free telephone number (1-888-466-2219) and a TDD line (1-877-688-9891) for the hearing and speech impaired. The Department's internet website ( www.dmhc.ca.gov) has complaint forms, IMR application forms, and instructions online. If you feel Blue Shield improperly cancels, rescinds, or does not renew coverage for you or your Dependents, you can submit a request for review to Blue Shield or to the Director of the California Department of Managed Health Care. Any request for review submitted to Blue Shield will be treated as an expedited grievance request. Independent medical review You may be eligible for an independent medical review if your grievance involves a claim or service for which coverage was denied on the grounds that the service is:Grievance process 81 Questions? Visit blueshieldca.com, use the Blue Shield mobile app, or call Customer Service at 1-855-599- 2650.Not Medically Necessary; or Experimental or Investigational (including the external review available under the Friedman-Knowles Experimental Treatment Act of 1996). You can apply to the Department of Managed Health Care (DMHC) for an independent medical review of the denial. For a Medical Necessity denial, you must first submit a grievance to Blue Shield and wait for at least 30 days before requesting an independent medical review. However, if the request qualifies for an expedited review as described above, or if it involves a determination that the requested service is Experimental or Investigational, you may request an independent medical review as soon as you receive a notice of denial from Blue Shield. The DMHC's application for independent medical review is included with your appeal outcome letter. The DMHC will review your application. If the request qualifies for independent medical review, the DMHC will select an independent review organization to conduct a clinical review of your medical records. You can submit additional records for consideration as well. There is no cost to you for this independent medical review. You and your provider will receive copies of the independent medical review determination. The decision of the independent review organization is binding on Blue Shield. If the reviewer determines that the requested service is clinically appropriate, Blue Shield will arrange for the service to be provided or the disputed claim to be paid. The independent medical review process is in addition to any other procedures or remedies available to you to resolve coverage disputes. It is completely voluntary. You are not required to participate in the independent medical review process, but if you do not, you may lose your statutory right to pursue legal action against Blue Shield regarding the disputed service. ERISA review If your Employer's health plan is governed by the Employee Retirement Income Security Act (\"ERISA\"), you may have the right to bring a civil action under Section 502(a) of ERISA if all required reviews of your claim have been completed and your claim has not been approved. Additionally, you and your Employer-sponsored plan may have other voluntary alternative dispute resolution options, such as mediation.82 Questions?

Blue Shield will send a Notice of End of Coverage to you and your Employer no later than five calendar days after the day coverage ends. Out-of-area services Overview Blue Shield has a variety of relationships with other Blue Cross and/or Blue Shield Licensees. Generally, these relationships are called Inter-Plan Arrangements and they work based on rules and procedures issued by the Blue Cross Blue Shield Association. Whenever you receive Covered Services outside of California, the claims for those services may be processed through one of these Inter-Plan Arrangements described below. When you access Covered Services outside of California, but within the United States, the Commonwealth of Puerto Rico, or the U.S. Virgin Islands (BlueCard\u00ae Service Area), you will receive the care from one of two kinds of providers. Participating providers contract with the local Blue Cross and/or Blue Shield Licensee in that other geographic area (Host Blue). Non-participating providers don't contract with the Host Blue. Blue Shield's payment practices for both kinds of providers are described below and in the Introduction section of this Evidence of Coverage. Other important information about your plan 84 Questions? Visit blueshieldca.com, use the Blue Shield mobile app, or call Customer Service at 1-855-599- 2650. See the Care outside of California section for more information about receiving care while outside of California. To find participating providers while outside of California, visit bcbs.com. Inter-Plan Arrangements Emergency Services Members who experience an Emergency Medical Condition while traveling outside of California should seek immediate care from the nearest Hospital. The Benefits of this plan will be provided anywhere in the world for treatment of an Emergency Medical Condition. BlueCard\u00ae Program Under the BlueCard\u00ae Program, benefits will be provided for Covered Services received outside of California, but within the BlueCard\u00ae Service Area. When you receive Covered Services within the geographic area served by a Host Blue, Blue Shield will remain responsible for doing what we agreed to in the contract. However, the Host Blue is responsible for contracting with and generally handling all interactions with its participating healthcare providers, including direct payment to the provider. Whenever you receive Covered Services outside of California, within the BlueCard Service Area, and the claim is processed through the BlueCard\u00ae Program, your Member share of cost for these services, if not a flat dollar Copayment, is calculated based on the lower of: The billed charges for Covered Services; or The negotiated price that the Host Blue makes available to Blue Shield. Often, this negotiated price will be a simple discount that reflects an actual price that the Host Blue pays to your healthcare provider. Sometimes, it is an estimated price that takes into account special arrangements with your healthcare provider or provider group that may include types of settlements, incentive payments, and/or other credits or charges. Occasionally, it may be an average price, based on a discount that results in expected average savings for similar types of healthcare providers after taking into account the same types of transactions as with an estimated price. Estimated pricing and average pricing, going forward, also take into account adjustments to correct for over- or underestimation of modifications of past pricing of claims as noted above. However, such adjustments will not affect the price Blue Shield used for your claim because these adjustments will not be applied retroactively to claims already paid. To find participating BlueCard\u00ae providers you can call BlueCard Access\u00ae at 1- 800-810-BLUE (2583) or go online at bcbs.com and select \"Find a Doctor.\" Other important information about your plan 85 Questions? Visit blueshieldca.com, use the Blue Shield mobile app, or call Customer Service at 1-855-599- 2650.Prior authorization may be required for non-emergency services. Please see the Medical Management Programs section for additional information on prior authorization and the Emergency Benefits section for information on emergency admission notification. Non-participating providers outside of California When Covered Services are provided outside of California and within the BlueCard\u00ae Service Area by non-participating providers, the amount you pay for such services will normally be based on either the Host Blue's non- participating provider local payment, the Allowable Amount Blue Shield pays a Non-Participating Provider in California if the Host Blue has no non- participating provider allowance, or the pricing arrangements required by applicable state or federal law. In these situations, you will be responsible for any difference between the amount that the non-participating provider bills and the payment Blue Shield will make for Covered Services as set forth in this paragraph. If you do not see a participating provider through the BlueCard\u00ae Program, you will have to pay the entire bill for your medical care and submit a claim to the local Blue Cross and/or Blue Shield plan, or to Blue Shield of California for reimbursement. Blue Shield will review your claim and notify you of its coverage determination within 30 days after receipt of the claim; you will be reimbursed as described in the preceding paragraph. Remember, your share of cost is higher when you see a non-participating provider. Your Cost Share for out-of-network Emergency Services will be the same as the amount due to a Participating Provider for such Covered Services, as listed in the Summary of Benefits. Blue Shield Global\u00ae Core Care for Covered Urgent and Emergency Services outside the BlueCard Service Area If you are outside of the BlueCard\u00ae Service Area, you may be able to take advantage of Blue Shield Global\u00ae Core when accessing Out-of-Area Covered Health Care Services. Blue Shield Global\u00ae Core is unlike the BlueCard\u00ae Program available within the BlueCard\u00ae Service Area in certain ways. For instance, although Blue Shield Global\u00ae Core assists you with accessing a network of inpatient, outpatient, and professional providers, the network is not served by a Host Blue. As such, when you receive care from provider outside the BlueCard\u00ae Service Area, you will typically have to pay the providers and submit the claim yourself to obtain reimbursement for these services. If you need assistance locating a doctor or hospital outside the BlueCard\u00ae Service Area you should call the service center at (800) 810-BLUE (2583) or call collect at (804) 673-1177, 24 hours a day, seven days a week.

If you receive covered services under a Blue Shield Value-Based Program, you will not be responsible for paying any of the Provider Incentives, risk- sharing, and/or Care Coordinator Fees that are a part of such an arrangement. BlueCard\u00ae Program If you receive Covered Services under a Value-Based Program inside a Host Blue's service area, you will not be responsible for paying any of the Provider Incentives, risk-sharing, and/or Care Coordinator Fees that are a part of such an arrangement, except when a Host Blue passes these fees to Blue Shield through average pricing or fee schedule adjustments.

You may be liable to the Participating Provider for the difference, if any, between the fees paid by Blue Shield and the reasonable value recovered for those services. Reductions - third-party liability If you are injured or become ill due to the act or omission of another person (a \"third party\"), Blue Shield shall, with respect to services required as a result of that injury, provide the Benefits of the plan and have an equitable right to restitution, reimbursement, or other available remedy to recover the amounts Blue Shield paid for services provided to you on a fee-for-service basis from any recovery (defined below) obtained by or on your behalf, from or on behalf of the third party responsible for the injury or illness, and you must agree to the provisions below. In addition, if you are injured and no other person is responsible but you receive (or are entitled to) a recovery from another source, and if Blue Shield paid Benefits for that injury, you must agree to the following provisions. All recoveries you or your representatives obtain (whether by lawsuit, settlement, insurance, or otherwise), no matter how described or designated, must be used to reimburse Blue Shield in full for Benefits Blue Shield paid. Blue Shield's share of any recovery extends only to the amount of Benefits it has paid or will pay you or your representatives. For purposes of this provision, your representatives include, if applicable, your heirs, administrators, legal representatives, parents (if you are a minor), successors, or assignees. This is Blue Shield's right of recovery. Blue Shield's right to restitution, reimbursement, or other available remedy is against any recovery you receive as a result of the injury or illness. This includes any amount awarded to you or received by way of court judgment, arbitration award, settlement, or any other arrangement, from any third party or third-party insurer, related to the illness or injury (the \"Recovery\"), whether or not you have been \"made whole\" by the Recovery. The amount Blue Shield seeks as restitution, reimbursement, or other available remedy will be calculated in accordance with California Civil Code Section 3040. Blue Shield will not reduce its share of any Recovery unless, in the exercise of our discretion, Blue Shield agrees in writing to a reduction (1) because you do not receive the full amount of damages that you claimed or (2) because you had to pay attorneys' fees. You must cooperate in doing what is reasonably necessary to assist Blue Shield with its right of recovery. You must not take any action that may prejudice Blue Shield's right of recovery. You must tell Blue Shield promptly if you have made a claim against another party for a condition that Blue Shield has paid or may pay Benefits for. You must seek recovery of Blue Shield's payments and liabilities, and you must tell us about any recoveries you obtain, whether in or out of court. Blue Shield may seek a first priority lien on the proceeds of your claim in order to be reimbursed to the full amount of Benefits Blue Shield has paid or will pay. Blue Shield may request that you sign a reimbursement agreement consistent with this provision. Your failure to comply with the above shall not in any way act as a waiver, release, or relinquishment of the rights of Blue Shield. Further, if you received services from a Participating Hospital for such injuries or illness, the Hospital has the right to collect from you the difference between the amount paid by Blue Shield and the Hospital's reasonable and necessary charges for such services Other important information about your plan 89 Questions? Visit blueshieldca.com, use the Blue Shield mobile app, or call Customer Service at 1-855-599- 2650.when payment or reimbursement is received by you for medical expenses. The Hospital's right to collect shall be in accordance with California Civil Code Section 3045.1. IF THIS PLAN IS PART OF AN EMPLOYEE WELFARE BENEFIT PLAN SUBJECT TO THE EMPLOYEE RETIREMENT INCOME SECURITY ACT OF 1974 (\"ERISA\"), YOU ARE ALSO REQUIRED TO DO THE FOLLOWING: Ensure that any recovery is kept separate from and not comingled with any other funds or your general assets; Agree in writing that the portion of any recovery required to satisfy the lien or other right of recovery of Blue Shield is held in trust for the sole benefit of Blue Shield until such time it is conveyed to Blue Shield; and Direct any legal counsel retained by you or any other person acting on your behalf to hold that portion of the recovery to which Blue Shield is entitled in trust for the sole benefit of Blue Shield and to comply with and facilitate the reimbursement to Blue Shield of the monies owed. Coordination of benefits, continued When you are covered by more than one group health plan, payments for allowable expenses will be coordinated between the two plans. Coordination of benefits ensures that benefits paid by multiple group health plans do not exceed 100% of allowable expenses. The coordination of benefits rules also determine which group health plan is primary and prevent delays in benefit payments. Blue Shield follows the rules for coordination of benefits as outlined in the California Code of Regulations, Title 28, Section 1300.67.13 to determine the order of benefit payments between two group health plans: When a plan does not have a coordination of benefits provision, that plan will always provide its benefits first. Otherwise, the plan covering you as an Employee will provide its benefits before the plan covering you as a Dependent. Coverage for Dependent children: oWhen the parents are not divorced or separated, the plan of the parent whose date of birth (month and day) occurs earlier in the year is primary. oWhen the parents are divorced and the specific terms of the court decree state that one of the parents is responsible for the health care expenses of the child, the plan of the responsible parent is primary. oWhen the parents are divorced or separated, there is no court decree, and the parent with custody has not remarried, the plan of the custodial parent is primary. oWhen the parents are divorced or separated, there is no court decree, and the parent with custody has remarried, the order of payment is as follows: The plan of the custodial parent; The plan of the stepparent; then The plan of the non-custodial parent. If the above rules do not apply, the plan which has covered you for the longer period of time is the primary plan. There may be exceptions for laid-off or retired Employees.Other important information about your plan 90 Questions? Visit blueshieldca.com, use the Blue Shield mobile app, or call Customer Service at 1-855-599- 2650.When Blue Shield is the primary plan, Benefits will be provided without considering the other group health plan. When Blue Shield is the secondary plan and there is a dispute as to which plan is primary, or the primary plan has not paid within a reasonable period of time, Blue Shield will provide Benefits as if it were the primary plan. Anytime Blue Shield makes payments over the amount they should have paid as the primary or secondary plan, Blue Shield reserves the right to recover the excess payments from the other plan or any person to whom such payments were made. These coordination of benefits rules do not apply to the programs included in the Limitation for Duplicate Coverage section. General provisions Independent contractors Providers are neither agents nor employees of Blue Shield but are independent contractors. In no instance shall Blue Shield be liable for the negligence, wrongful acts, or omissions of any person providing services, including any Physician, Hospital, or other Health Care Provider or their employees. Assignment The Benefits of this plan, including payment of claims, may not be assigned without the written consent of Blue Shield. Participating Providers are paid directly by Blue Shield. When you receive Covered Services from a Non-Participating Provider, Blue Shield, at its sole discretion, may make payment to the Subscriber or directly to the Non-Participating Provider. If Blue Shield pays the Non-Participating Provider directly, such payment does not create a third-party beneficiary or other legal relationship between Blue Shield and the Non-Participating Provider. The Subscriber must make sure the Non-Participating Provider receives the full billed amount for non- emergency services, whether or not Blue Shield makes payment to the Non- Participating Provider. Plan interpretation Blue Shield shall have the power and authority to construe and interpret the provisions of this plan, to determine the Benefits of this plan, and to determine eligibility to receive Benefits under the Contract.
