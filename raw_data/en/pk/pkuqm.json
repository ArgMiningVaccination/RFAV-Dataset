Dating back 6000 years, Ayurveda is the mother of all medical systems in the world and still very relevant today. It is a holistic approach to healthcare that seeks to bring balance to an individual through understanding the mind, body, senses and soul. It recognises that we are all unique and focuses on food, lifestyle, massage, yoga, breathing techniques and herbal remedies to suit our personal make-up. Rooted in the belief that every individual is capable of taking charge of their own life and healing potential, the wisdom of Ayurveda encourages us to take responsibility for our own health according to factors such as our basic constitution, the stages of our lives, the changing seasons and the environment in which we live and work. It provides guidance regarding diet and lifestyle so that the healthy can remain so and those facing health challenges can improve their wellbeing. As a qualified Ayurvedic practitioner, I will use observation and constitutional knowledge to diagnose patterns of imbalance, inherent strengths, weaknesses and tendencies. The ultimate aim of Ayurvedic medicine is to bring the individual back into balance with nature. What to expect in an Ayurvedic consultation ... I will confirm your individual body type based on the Ayurvedic constitutional principles. This is done by pulse and tongue diagnosis, visual observations and careful questioning. As well as identifying your underlying constitution, these methods make it possible to assess the current imbalances that may be contributing to ill health. You will then be given an individualised rebalancing programme that will include the following: Ayurvedic lifestyle education Herbs Massage techniques Yoga/exercise programme Dietary plan Meditation techniques Yoga breathing techniques I continue my training as an Ayurvedic Practitioner by regularly attending continuing professional development conferences.
