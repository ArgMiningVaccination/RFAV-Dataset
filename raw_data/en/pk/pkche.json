As I stared at the wart on my thumb, I had a realization. I could call my dermatologist and have it burnt off or I could use the power of my mind to heal myself. I chose self-hypnosis and in six weeks it was gone. On another occasion, I had to have a skin graph on my nose to repair an area where skin cancer was removed. A few days after the operative procedure my plastic surgeon had a worried look. When I inquired, he said he was afraid the graph wasn't going to take. He said it had been years since he had lost one. My first thought was that neither of us was going to lose this one. I thought that because I knew how to use my mind to help my body heal. I immediately went to work utilizing meditative and self-hypnosis healing techniques. The next day I was back in his office. This time he looked relieved and said that he saw signs that the graph was taking and that everything should be OK. Various psychotherapeutic approaches can harness the power within to bring healing to both mind and body. Unfortunately, some medical professionals overlook this connection. Too seldom does one hear of a patient being encouraged to participate in their healing by tapping into the inner resources of their own mind. Yet research continues to underscore the inseparable connection between mind and body. Numerous studies document that your immune system becomes stronger through participation in counseling. Hypnotherapy has helped people overcome allergies, recover from operations more quickly, and reduce dependence on pain medication. I have studied with the Simonton's who used psychotherapy, imagery, and self-hypnosis to help prolong the lives of their cancer patients and in some cases heal them all together. Their book \"Getting Well Again\" is excellent. Bernie Siegel, M.D. who wrote \"Mind, Medicine, and Miracles\" also studied with them. For people who want to be equal participants in the healing process, it is time to consider the opportunities available through psychotherapy. Therapy can engage the mind's ability to heal existing dis-ease and prevent the development of others. Some form of mental healing is essential for a holistic approach to health. Many physical illnesses have psychological components. According to the American Medical Association, two-thirds of all office visits to family physicians are due to stress-related symptoms. Stress is a major contributor to the six leading causes of death in our country; heart disease, lung ailments, cancer, cirrhosis of the liver, accidental injuries, and suicide. Psychotherapists are specialists in treating stress-related symptoms. Through the use of various therapies, they help people engage their mind's natural healing ability. Research has shown the connection between stress, traumas, emotional distress, and various physical maladies. It is also clear that help is available for these problems through drug-free psychotherapeutic interventions. A healthy mind promotes a healthy body. Changing the way you think can influence how you feel. Resolving issues such as traumas, abuse, stress, grief, depression, low self-esteem, negative beliefs, addictions, fears, and relationship pain can greatly improve your well-being and wellness. Such resolution naturally leads to inner peace, balance, relief, more energy, calmness, joy, strength, and a feeling of freedom. Unlocking your mind's ability to resolve problems and pain can help both your mind and body. Self-hypnosis audios can be great tools to help you with reducing stress, increasing self-esteem, losing weight, and for increasing "}
