During immunity IV Therapy, your body will be given a wide variety of vitamins and minerals that are important to the overall function of the immune system.

Some of the vitamins you will receive during [IV treatment](https://shastameadowswellness.com/services/iv-therapy/) for the immune system include: There are numerous B complex vitamins that will be given to you during IV drip therapy. Some B vitamins, such as Vitamin B6, are responsible for producing white blood cells, which fight infection. Vitamin B12 is also responsible for producing red blood cells, which provide oxygen and nutrients to the immune system. Numerous B complex vitamins are responsible for the health of your immune system. That is why they are included in IV therapy. Vitamin C is also an important part of your IV immune booster. Vitamin C protects neutrophils, which are specific types of white blood cells. Vitamin C scavenges oxidative stress that would otherwise damage your white blood cells, keeping them alive so they can fight infection. Vitamin C is one of the most important vitamins for the overall health of your immune system. Vitamin D is responsible for modulating and regulating the responses of both the innate and adaptive immune systems. Vitamin D increases the effectiveness of macrophages and monocytes, which are white blood cells that play an important role in protecting the body. Vitamin D improves the ability of these specific white blood cells to fight off pathogens, including bacteria and viruses. This is important for preventing you from getting sick and helping you recover. These are just a few of the many vitamins that drip IV Therapy will provide.
