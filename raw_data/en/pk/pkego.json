Holistic medicine incorporates the mind, body, and spirit in the practice of healing and wellness. For a patient to achieve optimal health, it's not enough to simply address the symptoms of disease. It's important to address the underlying conditions and factors causing the symptoms in the first place. Holistic medicine focuses on lifestyle changes and self-care to promote wellness. It also focuses on complementary and alternative therapies such as meditation and massage therapy. Here at Pacific Coast Aesthetics, we believe holistic medicine is an important component of overall health and wellness. Yes, we do! Our instructor, April Umek, has been a yoga instructor for the past ten years and trained under the world-renowned yoga and meditation teacher Rolf Gates. She assists with instructor-training seminars and incorporates meditation and integrated mindfulness into her life and medical practice. Today, April teaches here at Pacific Coast Aesthetics! April's teaching incorporates a flow-style of yoga with meditation and music to feed the soul. She also incorporates her background knowledge of medicine and sports. From all this, April puts together classes for all levels of students. Her goals are to bring students into the present moment, nurture their minds and spirits, and then empower them to take this positive energy and mindfulness into the world. We believe you'll have an amazing experience, and we welcome you to contact our clinic for further information! Yes, we provide this as well!
