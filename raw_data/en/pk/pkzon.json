Health specialists often prescribe a detox to cleanse our bodies and restore our health, we need to close temporarily for our souls and spirits to get nourished. Often Christians need a spiritual detox to invigorate our souls. Our spirit also is subject to spiritual toxins, and we are all in need of spiritual cleansing on a regular basis to keep our spiritual life healthy. So i will ask, how often do you detox spiritually? How often do you take time to think deeply on your spiritual health and devise means to improve that health? The bible clearly states that, \"Therefore, having these promises, beloved, let us cleanse ourselves from all defilement of flesh and spirit, perfecting holiness in the fear of God. (2 Corinthians 7:1) What are those things that are slowly eating away at you? What are you defiling your spirit and flesh with? Have you considered the bible reading recipe? Have you thought about how good it will be for you to spend some time feeding on the word and nourishing your system with the food it so badly needs? \"At one time we too were foolish, disobedient, deceived and enslaved by all kinds of passions and pleasures. We lived in malice and envy, being hated and hating one another. But when the kindness and love of God our Savior appeared, he saved us, not because of righteous things we had done, but because of his mercy. He saved us through the washing of rebirth and renewal by the Holy Spirit, whom he poured out on us generously through Jesus Christ our Savior, so that, having been justified by his grace, we might become heirs having the hope of eternal life. (Titus 3:3-7) So here is the big question. What are you and i going to do about this eternal life that we have received by grace? Someone told me yesterday that i have everything i need in Christ but, i need to start operating my faith. I know full well, that Eternal life can not be interrupted by anything, not even sin. so why not spend time edifying my spirit and soul with the word of my Father who has freely given me all things instead of living in condemnation? Why not abstain from the passions that so easily ensnare me and build intimacy with my new husband, having died to sin in Christ? The only way i know , that is proved to work, is spending time in the word as a means to spiritually detox. Try it out, thank me later,,,,,,it works like magic. Therefore, while we take some time off to do our spiritual detox, let us activate our faith, let us not Limit God with our shallow imaginations and scenario building. Let us Boldly approach the Throne with the knowledge that we already have received all that pertains to life and godliness and all we have to do is operate our faith. Let us walk with our chests out and heads high, knowing full well that we are the righteousness of God in Christ Jesus. "}
