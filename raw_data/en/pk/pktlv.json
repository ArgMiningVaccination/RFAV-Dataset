Here is my [Academia.edu page], my [Phil Papers page], and my [Google Scholar]page. I am on research leave for the 2013-14 academic year, working on a project on \"The Signifiance of Inequality\", funded by the [Institute for New (INET)]. [My book, edited with Thad Williamson,] Property-Owning Democracy: Rawls and Beyond, was published by Wiley-Blackwell in March 2012. The book's publisher's page is [here]. Its Facebook page is [here]. \"This splendid volume offers a fresh alternative to stale debates about the welfare state versus unfettered markets. It invites us to think anew about the economic arrangements that make democracy possible. The book reconnects political philosophy with political economy, and sets a new and promising agenda for political theory, and for democratic politics.\" -- Michael J. Sandel, Harvard University \"Rawls did not say much about property-owning democracy: that is the purpose of this volume, the basis of the \"Rawls and Beyond\" in its subtitle. The essays collected here provide a serious, critical exploration of the appeal and potential of property-owning democracy. Beginning with Martin O'Neill and Thad Williamson's illuminating and instructive introduction, the volume is historically grounded, philosophically informed, and inspiringly alive with good practical and moral sense.\" -- Joshua Cohen and Joel Rogers, from their Foreword to the book :: RESEARCH My research is primarily in moral and political philosophy. My topics of special interest include: * theories of equality and social justice, including global justice and intergenerational justice; * liberty, autonomy, choice and responsibility; * the political philosophies of John Rawls, Ronald Dworkin, G. A. Cohen, Thomas Nagel and T. M. Scanlon; * normative dimensions of a variety of issues in public policy - especially taxation, financial regulation, corporate governance, workplace democracy, labour policy, trade unions, welfare state regimes, climate change, health policy and education. I am working with [Shepley Orr](of University College London), on an edited collection on Taxation and Political Philosophy, which is forthcoming from Oxford University Press. I organized an international conference on [Justice, Rights and Institutions: Themes from the Political Philosophy of T. M. Scanlon], which was held at the [School of Social Scienes]at the University of Manchester on 22-23 May 2009. A special issue of the [Journal of Moral Philosophy]on Scanlon's political philosophy, containing papers from this conference, is forthcoming. I have written regularly for the [New Statesman], on political ideas and the philosophical dimension of current politics. [ [Articles can be accessed here].] I've also written for [The Guardian's Comment is Free]website on various topics, and for The Big Issue and Tax Justice Focus. I am a co-investigator on a research project on \" [Climate Change, Justice and Vulnerability]\"directed by John O'Neill and Sarah Lindley(Manchester), and funded by the [Joseph Rowntree Foundation]. With John O'Neill, I am co-author of a Joseph Rowntree Foundation Viewpoint Report, on \" [Social Justice and the Future of Flood Insurance]\" (published March 2012).
