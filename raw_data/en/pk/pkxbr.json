For more than 30 years I dealt with digestion issues. I tried many 'traditional' remedies with little to no success. I had come to the conclusion \"that's just the way I am.\" Recently, a friend suggested that I try acupuncture to resolve those issues. Although I didn't have any expectations, I decided I would try one more thing and if it didn't work it would confirm \"that's just the way I am.\" I was so pleased, and somewhat surprised, when after only a few treatments I noticed such an improvement. As I continued my course of treatment I saw improvement not only in my digestion, but in my sleep pattern, in my circulation, in my skin and in my overall well being. I haven't felt this good in years. I attribute my success not only to the art and science of acupuncture, but to the concern and caring treatment that I received at Root and Soul. My treatment was tailored specifically to my body and needs which can only happen when you have a practitioner who truly cares about you as an individual and is dedicated to supporting a personal journey to better health I came in for a consult with Shani on a friend's recommendation and could not have had a better experience. She is incredibly knowledgeable and did a great job sitting me down to go over my needs before helping me to decide on the best treatment options for me. After my first treatment, I ended up taking some \"Evil Bone Water\" spray home with me to use as needed. This stuff is amazing. You should absolutely ask her about it! I can't say enough great things about Shani! I've visited her practice several times now for Acupuncture, cupping, and Wellness treatments. She's definitely skilled in her art form, and while she's incredibly knowledgeable in her field, she seems to ALSO have an innate intuition as to what could be troubling you and how to remedy the issues. Usually when I see her it's for joint, muscle, and intestinal issues... But lately we have honed in on the fact that I am starting to show symptoms of carpal tunnel syndrome. My wrist and hand was so sore the day I saw her, but in the days afterward I didn't feel a single twinge of pain! I've also referred three very happy patients to her, all which are satisfied with her treatments. Best treatment I have ever had. Acupuncture has improved my life in so many ways. I hadn't remembered what it was like to not feel pain in my shoulder and back. After my first treatment I left pain free, which was amazing. Acupuncture has improved my life if so many ways from preventing a cold from coming on to eliminating IBS flare ups. The environment, space, and energy Shani brings to treatment is truly serene and healing. I highly recommend Root & Soul for whole body/mind wellness.
