It is one of the largest and most comprehensive private well studies in the nation . As such, it provides value at two levels: the local knowledge for residents of Grant, Iowa, and Lafayette Counties and the broader contribution to groundwater sc ience. The report is organized into discrete sections that can be read independently . Following the summary and background, there is one section for each of the five study objectives, with each section organized as follows: a) objective, b) approach, c) key findings, d) context and interpretation, e) strengths and limitations, and f) conclusions. The report can be read at several l evels. Reading the summary alone will provide the important highlights. More detailed highlights are given in the \"key findings\" sub -section under each objective, and a discussion of the results is included in each \"context and interpretation\" sub-section. The reader may wish to focus on one or two objectives, in which case it is not necessary to read the other objectives because each can generally stand alone . For greater detail, the appendices can be read for technical information and additional data . Finally, the study will also be reported in a peer -reviewed scientific journal publication with an emphasis on technical information and the broader scientific context. 5 Summary R ural residents of Grant, Iowa, and Lafayette Counties in Wisconsin rely on private wells for their water . Contaminants like nitrate and bacteria from septic systems, fertilizer, and manure can contaminate the groundwater that residents use . Groundwater is vulnerable to contamination where the soil layer is thin and the bedrock is fractured, which is the case for much of the study region . This study includes five objectives that were designed to assess and understand private well water contamination in the three counties . Objective 1. Extent of private well contamination The extent of bacteria and nitrate private well contamination was determined by testing randomly selected wells in two water sampling events . A total of 840 water samples were tested for nitrate, total coliform bacteria, and E. coli, which are standard tests of well wat er quality . Overall, 126 (42%) of 301 wells sampled in November 2018 and 145 (27%) of 539 wells sampled in April 2019 were positive for total coliform bacteria and/or had nitrate greater than the Wisconsin and U.S. Environmental Protection Agency health standard (10 mg nitrate - nitrogen per liter) . The percentage of study wells with total coliforms or high nitrate was generally greater than statewide percentages for private wells. Figure 1. Percentage of wells positive for total co liforms and E. coli and with high nitrate. Wells were randomly selected and tested in November 2018 or April 2019. Objective 2. Human wastewater and livestock manure contamination Tests that distinguish between human wastewater, bovine (cattle) manure, and porcine (pig) manure were used to identify fecal sources of contamination. For these tests, 138 wells were randomly selected from those positive for total coliforms or with high nitrate (Figure 2) . Human wastewater was detected in 64 wells, cat tle manure was detected in 33 wells, and pig manure was detected in 13 wells, indicating that both human wastewater and livestock manure contribute to private well contamination. The tests identify the three specific fecal sources but not other types of co ntamination, like chemical fertilizers or manure from other animals . These tests can not determine the source of contamination for nitrate , total coliforms, or E. coli , which can originate from many places. 6 Figure 2. Wells for Objective 1 were randomly selected from all wells in the region. Wells for Objectives 2 and 3 were randomly selected from wells tested in Objective 1 that were positive for total coliforms and/or had high nitrate. The same 138 well water samples were tested for Objectives 2 and 3 . Objective 3. Pathogens in private wells Residents may become ill from drinking water that contains pathogens, like viruses and bacteria. The 138 wells tested for Objective 2 were also tested for pathogens . These wells were randomly selected from those positive for total coliforms or with high nitrate ( Figure 2 ). Pathogens were detected in 66 of the 138 wells (48 %). Many of the pathogens can be passed between humans and animals, so their source was often unknown. Figure 3. Percentage of 138 wells positive for human wastewater, bovine manure, porcine manure, and pathogens. Wells were randomly selected from those positive for total coliforms and/or with high nitra te and were sampled in one of four seasonal events . Objective 4. Factors related to contamination: well characteristics, well siting, geology, rainfal l and groundwater levels Well characteristics, well siting, geology, rainfall, and groundwater levels were examined for relationships to the contaminants measured in Objectives 1 and 2 . These factors affect the tendency for contaminants to reach groundwater or enter wells . Nitrate contamination was generally greater where the geology allows rapid flow of water and contaminants . Microbial 7 Figure 5. Cross -section illustration of well characteristics that were examined for relationships with contamination.

Table with a s ummary of well characteristics and geologic factors related to private well contamination. 8 contamination was generally greater following periods of rainfall and where bedrock is closer to the surface. Both nitrate and microbial contamination were generally greater for older, shallower wells. The factors reflect probabilities, not absolutes. For example, high nitrate is more likely for shallow wells, but this does not mean that all wells that are shallow will have high nitrate. Obj ective 5. Factors related to contamination: septic systems, farms, and cultivated land Septic systems, farms, and cultivated land were examined for their relationships with the contaminants measured in Objectives 1 and 2 . Human wastewater contamination was greater for wells closer to septic systems and for wells with more septic systems nearby . Septic systems were not associated with nitrate and total coliforms . Nitrate and total coliforms contamination were greater for wells closer to farms or cultivated land (fields used for crops like corn) . Also, nitrate contaminat ion increased when the area of cultivated land nearby was larger. Like Objective 4, these factors reflect probabilities, not absolutes. Figure 6 .

Illustration of land use surrounding a well. Land use factors included the distance to cultivated land, the area of cultivated land within a set radius around the well, the distance to the nearest septic system, and the number of septic systems within a set radius around the well. Applicability to other counties and regions The study describes private well contamination for southwest Wisconsin. Because geology, land use, and well construction can affect contamination, they must be considered when applying these findings in other regions . For example, findings may be more relevant to regions with carbonate rock geology (which is common in the study area) than to regions with sand aquifers (which is less common in the study area) . However, regions with similar geology may have different sources of contamination because land use diff ers. For example, urban or forested areas may have different contamination sources than the rural, agricultural region where this study took place. Broadly speaking, the study shows that nitrate, fecal waste, and pathogens can enter groundwater . It also shows that private well contamination is related to the sources of these contaminants and how they move to and through groundwater . These broader observations reflect existing knowledge that applies beyond southwest Wisconsin. Study outcomes The study produced two general outcomes related to groundwater quality in southwest Wisconsin . First, the study describes the extent of private well contamination based on standard tests of water quality (Objective 1), and it further indicates the potential for pathogens to contaminate private wells (Objective 3) . Second, the study describes the sources of contamination and shows that contamination was related to multiple factors (Objectives 2, 4, and 5) . By identifying multiple sources and factors related to private well contamination, the study may be used when considering potential priorities for groundwater quality . Importantly, the study g oes beyond a description of contamination, and it may also be used to inform efforts or actions that address contamination. Together, these two outcomes provide a unique contribution to groundwater science and a detailed characterization of private well drinking water quality for the residents of southwest Wisconsin. 10 Background Residents in rural areas of Grant, Iowa, and Lafayette Counties rely on private wells for their drinking water . There are approximately 16,000 construction records for private wells in the three -county region ( Wisconsin Department of Natural Resources (WDNR) Well Construction Information System ), and there are additional wells for which construction records are unavailable . Water quality for private wells is not regularly monitored by federal, state, or local government, so homeowners are responsible for the maintenance and testing of their private we ll. Well water quality is commonly assessed by testing for indicator bacteria (total coliforms and E. coli ) and nitrate (Appendix 1). Total coliforms are a group of bacteria that includes E. coli , and their presence in a well indicates that microbial conta minants near the land surface can reach well water. While total coliforms are generally not harmful, Wisconsin DNR recommends corrective actions when they are detected in private (WDNR 10 mg/L exceed Wisconsin's groundwater quality standard, which is consistent with the maximum contaminant level given by the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency for public water systems (USEPA 2022; WDNR 2010, 2021). Bacteria in groundwater can originate from fecal sources, like manure and wastewater, and from non- fecal sources . Nitrate can originate from fecal sources, chemical fertilizers, and natural sources . Bacteria and nitrate are carried to groundwater by rain and melting snow . Well defects c an contribute to contamination, but properly constructed wells can also be subject to contamination when groundwater is contaminated from sources on the landscape. Figure 8. Cross section of bedrock layers. U pper and lower aquifers are indicated on the left; they are separated by the Glenwood Shale (the shale is too thin to show as a separate unit). Water levels in deep wells finished in the lower aquifer can stand far below water levels in shallower wells finished in the upper aquifer, as illustrat ed at the left. The Sinnipee Group is indicated on the right; it is the topmost bedrock in much of the region but is absent in some areas (see Figure 9 and Appendix 2) . 11 In addition to contaminant sources, geology influences the vulnerability of groundwa ter to contaminants . The regional hydrogeology is summarized in Appendix 2 . The bedrock in Grant, Iowa, and Lafayette Counties includes multiple layers that can be grouped into two bedrock aquifers, lower and upper, separated by an aquitard called the Glenwood Shale . Sand and gravel forms a third aquifer in valley bottoms (Figure 8 ; Carson 2012) . The lower aquifer consists of sandstone and dolomite . The upper aquifer is composed of dolomite and limestone of the Sinnipee Group. The Sinnipee Group is the uppe rmost bedrock in most of the study area (Figure 9), and these carbonate rocks have fractures and voids that allow water and contaminants to move quickly . Given the bedrock's limited ability to filter contaminants, the soil overlying bedrock is essential fo r removing contaminants prior to reaching the groundwater . There is less than 50 feet of soil and sediment in much of the study area (Wisconsin Geological and Natural History Survey 2009), and areas with shallow soils and fractured bedrock are often consid ered vulnerable to contamination. Objectives The objectives of this research were designed to assess the extent, sources, and factors of private well water contamination in Grant, Iowa, and Lafayette Counties . The original research proposal included three objectives (numbers 1, 2, and 4 in the list below) . Two objectives (numbers 3 and 5) were added after the project was initiated to provide additional information, and the scope of one of the original objectives was expanded (Objective 4) . Results for the following 5 objectives are presented in this report: 1) Evaluate private well contamination in three counties (Grant, Iowa, and Lafayette) using indicator bacteria (total coliforms and E. coli ) and nitrate based on randomized synoptic (\"snapshot\") sampling ev ents. 2) Identify fecal sources of contamination in a subset of wells that were positive for total coliforms and/or had high nitrate . Sample once per season and use microbial tests that distinguish between human, bovine, and porcine fecal sources. 3) Analyze private well samples collected for Objective 2 for genes specific to certain pathogens. 4) Assess well construction and geologic characteristics (e.g., well age, bedrock depth) that are related to well contamination. 5) Identify land use factors and potential contamination sources (e.g., number of nearby septic systems, distance to an agricultural field) related to well contamination. 12 Objective 1 Objective Evaluate private well contamination in three counties (Grant, Iowa, and Lafayette) using indicator bacteria (total coliforms and E. coli ) and nitrate based on randomized synoptic (\"snapshot\") sampling events. Approach: Well selection and sample collection To produce a representative estimate of contamination in the study area, private wells were sampled in two synoptic (\"snapshot\") events: November 9 - 10, 2018 and April 11 - 12, 2019. Wells were randomly selected irrespective of county . Invitations were sent to 1,250 well owners in November and 2,083 in April, and 25% of invited well owners participated. Well owners collected samples using kits and instructions provided by the laboratory . Project staff delivered samples the day they were collected to the Water and Environmental Analysis Laboratory at the University of Wisconsin -Stevens Point for a nalysis of total coliforms, E. coli , and nitrate, which are standard tests of water quality . Appendix 3 describes sample collection and analysis . Testing was free to participants, and well owners received their individual test results . A total of 840 sampl es from 816 randomly selected private wells were tested, including 24 wells sampled in both events. Groundwater contamination changes over time, and the study approach was designed to account for this fact in two ways . First, the synoptic sampling design minimized short -term variation in source and transport conditions, like rainfall, by sampling wells over a short period . Results for each two -day synoptic sampling event therefore represent contamination in the study area under the conditions around the time that samples were collected . Second, the study was designed to capture longer -term variation in source and transport conditions by including two events that were five months apart. Key finding s 126 (42%) of 301 private wells sampled in November 2018 an d 145 (27%) of 539 private wells sampled in April 2019 were positive for total coliform bacteria and/or had nitrate greater than the drinking water standard of 10 mg NO 3--N/L (Table 1) . These percentage s are greater than or similar to statewide percentages for private wells. Contaminated private wells were distributed across the study area ( Figure 9) . The percentage of wells with high nitrate was similar between the two sampling events, while the percentage of wells positive for total coliforms d iffered (Table 1) . Variation in private well contamination from one point in time to another is expected because contamination sources and transport conditions , like rainfall, change. The mean concentration for samples with detectable nitrate was 6 mg NO 3--N/L (maximum of 67 mg NO 3--N/L), and the concentrations for total coliforms and E. coli tended to be low, on the order of ones to tens Most Probable Number per 100 mL (Table 2). 13 Table 1.

The groundwater quality standard is 10 mg/L (WDNR 2010, 2021). bMean excludes samples with total coliform greater than the upper detection limit (2 for each event). Context and i nterpretation Groundwater contamination can change . The synoptic sampling events provide two \"snapshots\" of private well contamination . The percentage of wells that were contaminated by total coliforms differed between the two events, consistent with the transient nature of groundwater contamination by microbes (Borchardt et al. 2021; Bradbury et al. 2013; Stokdyk et al. 202 0). The difference in total coliforms contamination from November to April may reflect a change in the sources of these bacteria, or it may reflect differences in rain or snowmelt that carried the bacteria to groundwater . The fact that nitrate contaminatio n was similar for the two events may indicate that the contaminant sources differed for nitrate and total coliforms, or it may reflect differences in the contaminants themselves . For example, total coliform bacteria are affected by temperature and moisture and can die in the environment, so they are expected to be less persistent than nitrate, which is a chemical that can persist for decades (Nolan 2001) . Microbes (like total coliforms) and chemicals (like nitrate) behave differently when moving to and through groundwater (Hunt and Johnson 2017). 14 Figure 9. Total coliforms (top panel) and nitrate (bottom panel) results for the two synoptic sampling events. Comparison to private well data in Wisconsin . Data prior to the current study (from UW - Stevens Point Center for Watershed Science and Education Well Water Quality Viewer in 2018) show that across the three counties 13% of 4,283 samples exceeded 10 mg NO 3- -N/L, while 29% and 3% of 1,747 samples were positive for total coliforms and E. coli , respectively . These percentages are similar to results from the current study, but the previous data reflect samples 15 collected over time (rather than synoptically) and on a voluntary basis (rather than selected randomly) . The percentage of contaminated private wells in the study area generally equaled or exceeded statewide percentages based on tests for total coliforms, E. coli , and nitrate (Table 1) . Specifically, the percentage of wells with high nitrate in both synoptic events (15 - 16%) was greater than statewide percentages of 7 to 10% (WDATCP 2017; Knobeloch et al. 2013; U.S. General Accounting Office 1997) . The percentage of study wells positive for total coliforms in November (34%) was greater than statewide percentages of 23% and 18%, but the percentage of positive study wells in April (16%) was not (Knobeloch et al. 2013; U.S. General Accounting Office 1997) . The percentage of study wells positive for E. coli was not different from statewide percentages . Three reports were used for comparison to the current study, so the statewide data include samples collected in various seasons and years. The percentage of contaminated private wells in the study also generally equaled or exceeded percentages from a similar study in Kewaunee County, Wisconsin, which is a rural area underlain by fractured dolomite . A recent groundwater study there used the same randomized synoptic sampling design and found that 34% of 323 private wells in one sampling event and 31% of 401 private wells in a second event were positive f or total coliforms or had high nitrate (Borchardt et al. 2021) . In that study, 27% and 22% of wells were positive for total coliforms in the two synoptic events, and 12% and 11% of wells had high nitrate (Borchardt et al. 2021). Strengths and limitations Testing many wells using a randomized, synoptic sampling design produce d data that represent the study region, including variation in land use, geology, and well characteristics, while limiting the effects of weather or other factors that change over time . Fall and spring synoptic sampling events were included to assess contamination at different points in time, but the study was not designed to formally assess seasonal differences or temporal trends. Conclusions Results of Objective 1 are based on a randomized selection of wells and describe the extent of private well contamination in the study area in terms of standard water quality tests . The percentage of wells in the region that were positive for indicator bacteria or had high nitrate equaled or exceeded statewide percentages for private wells and may provide a benchmark for future monitoring . Nitrate contamination was similar for the two events while total coliforms differed, consistent with the fact that groundwater contamination can vary with factors that change over time. 16 Objective 2 Objective Identify fecal sources of contamination in a subset of wells that were positive for total coliforms and/or had high nitrate . Sample once per season and use microbial tests that distinguish between human, bovine, and porcine fecal sources. Approach: W ell selection, sampling, and analysis Wells for Objective 2 were randomly selected from wells tested in Objective 1 that were positive for total coliforms or had nitrate greater than 10 mg NO 3--N/L. This subset of wells was sampled again to identify fecal sources of contamination . We selected from wells that were previously contaminated to increase the chances of identifying fecal sources in the groundwater samples , but the tests were not intended to determine the fecal source s of total coliforms and nitrate (see \"Strengths and limitations\" below) . We sampled 34 or 35 different wells in each of four seasonal events (April 9 - 13, August 5 - 8, and November 4 - 7 of 2019 and March 3 - 6 of 2020) for a total of 138 wells . Samples were collected by laboratory staff from a tap prior to any treatment systems . The tap was sterilized with flame, and new equipment was used for each sample . One liter of water was collected in a sterile bottle, and then a large volume of water (approximately 200 gallons) was run through a hemodialysis filter that captures microbes as the water passes through it (Figure 10) . Both sample types were tested for the same microbes . We used these two sample collection methods, both of which are established and used by scientists worldwide, because each has strengths and weaknesses, and combining their results provides a comprehensive assessment of contamination. Fecal sources were identified by microbial source tracking (MST), in which samples are tested for microbes that are found in the fecal material of certain animals . Well water samples were analyzed for 17 genetic tests for microbes that are specific to human, bo vine/ruminant, or porcine fecal material; these are referred to as human wastewater markers and livestock manure markers (collectively \"fecal markers\") . The most frequently detected fecal markers do not cause illness, though pathogens (microbes that cause illness) were also detected (see Objective 3). Negative controls were analyzed alongside samples to ensure that laboratory contamination was absent. Laboratory procedures are described in Appendi x 3 and Borchardt et al. (2021). Key finding s Overall, 78 of 138 wells (56%) were positive for microbes that indicate the presence of a specific fecal source (Table 3 ), including 26 wells positive for microbes from multiple fecal sources . Results for each county are reported in Appendix 5. Among the 138 wells sample d, human wastewater was detected in more wells (46%) than bovine/ruminant manure (24%) and were positive for fec esborne microbes that are not specific to a fecal source (see Objective 3). 17 Table 3.

Note: In addition to the microbial source tracking markers , the plant pathogen \"pepper mild mottle virus\" was detected in 10 wells . It is common in human wastewater and often used as a marker of human fecal contamination, but it may originate in other sources and was therefore not included in the count of wells positive for human wastewater. Most (7 of 10) wells positive were also positiv e for a human wastewater marker. 18 Context and interpretation Fecal loading to the landscape . Septic systems and agricultural manure are common sources of human, bovine, and porcine fecal material. There are approximately 15,930 septic systems in the three -county region according to county records, which release an estimated total of 687 million gallons of effluent per year. Even properly functioning septic systems release nitrate and microorganisms (Lusk et al. 2017; Murphy et al. 2020) . Land application of septage and sludge is a lesser source of human fecal material in the study area. Wisconsin DNR records for 2018 indicate that 82 fields (totaling 753 acres) received a total of 6.9 million gallons of septage or municipal sludge in one year, which is 1% of the effluent volume released from septic systems annually . The 368,128 cattle in the study area produce an estimated 2.4 billion gallons of manure per year, and the 77,600 pigs produce an estimated 39 million gallons of manure per year. Fecal volume computations are provided in Appendix 6. While the estimated volume of cattle manure produced annually in the study area is three times greater than the estimated volume of septic system effluent, more wells were positive for human wastewater markers than bovine . The timing, location, and form of wastewater and manure on the landscape may contribute to the difference in the percentage of wells contaminated by each . For example, septic system effluent is released continuously, while manure that is stored an d land -applied to fields is present intermittently . In addition, farmland comprises 80% of the study area, so manure is potentially distributed over a larger area than septic systems, which would result in a lower fecal source density . The prevalence of pasture (15% of farmland in the study area) and cattle grazing may likewise be a factor (NASS 2019) . Finally, wastewater from septic systems is released underground, sheltering it from desiccation and microbe -killing sunlight while also giving it a shorter travel distance to the groundwater table than manure applied to the land surface . Overall, b oth human and livestock fecal sources were detected in wells. Comparison to other private well data. Microbial source tracking analyses that identify the fecal sourc es of contamination are not common for private wells, and statewide data are not available for comparison . Among studies in the United States and Canada that tested private wells for fecal markers, the percentage of samples positive for human, bovine, or porcine fecal markers varied considerably (from 0 to 61%), which reflects variation in land use, geology, groundwater dynamics, well characteristics, well selection, and the tests used (Allevi et al. 2013, Felleiter et al. 2020, Krolik et al. 20 14, Murphy et al. 2020, Zhang et al. 2014) . Like the current study, human wastewater markers were detected in more private well samples than bovine when both were analyzed (Felleiter et al. 2020, Krolik et al. 2014, Zhang et al. 2014) . Results for the thre e-county study area in southwest Wisconsin fall within the broad range reported in other studies, though the number of studies for comparison is limited. The study in Kewaunee County, Wisconsin also found that both human and livestock fecal sources contri buted to contamination (Borchardt et al. 2021) . Specifically, 33 and 44 of 131 wells were positive for human wastewater and bovine manure markers, respectively (porcine manure was not included) . The dominant fecal sources (manure and septic systems) and fr actured bedrock in Kewaunee County are generally similar to that of southwest Wisconsin but differ in ways that may affect groundwater contamination. 19 First, the quantity, form, distribution, and timing of fecal sources on the landscape may differ in the two study areas . For example, the density of septic systems and cattle is greater in Kewaunee County (2 septic systems and 49 cattle per 100 acres) than the three -county study area in southwest Wisconsin (1 septic system and 23 cattle per 100 acres). The percentage of cattle on large farms (farms with >500 cattle) is greater in Kewaunee County (76% of cattle) than in southwest Wisconsin (35%), and the percentage of farmland in pasture is greater in southwest Wisconsin (15%) than in Kewaunee County (2%; NASS 2 019, Bay Lake Regional Planning Commission 2016) . Second, topography and the specific geology differ, which can affect the transport of contaminants to groundwater (Hynds et al. 2014; Murphy et al. 2017) . Likewise, groundwater levels and precipitation diff ered, which also affect contaminant transport (Hunt and Johnson 2017; Murphy et al. 2017) . Overall, both studies identified contamination of private wells by human and agricultural sources in a fractured aquifer setting. Figure 10. Microbes in wells we re captured by running 200 gallons of water through hemodialysis filters. Strengths and limitations The number of wells positive for human wastewater, bovine/ruminant manure, and porcine manure is expected to vary over time as fecal sources and weather change, and we included seasonal sampling events to capture such variation. However, a single sampling event per season is insufficient to characterize contamination by season or generalize results to future years . For example, microbial contamination for the April sampling event is not necessarily indicative of other springs, and the number of wells contaminated in spring may not always be greater than the number contaminated in other seasons. Because they detect genetic signatures, the tests used for Objecti ve 2 are highly specific to the fecal source and have been validated and used in the scientific literature (Appendix 3) . Multiple fecal markers were used for each fecal source, which increases the chances of detecting fecal material when it is present. While the genetic tests do not indicate whether the 20 microbes were alive or dead, the presence of host -specific microbes identifies the fecal source regardless. Fecal markers for human, bovine/ruminant, and porcine fecal material were included, but other fecal sources (e.g., poultry, wildlife) can also contaminate wells . One of the commonly detected manure markers, ruminant Bacteroides , is shed not only by cattle but also by other ruminants, including deer . There are an estimated 88,600 deer in the study area ( WDNR 2018) . However, the estimated total mass of fecal material produced annually by cattle in the study area (8.9 billion kg per year) is 1,000 times greater than that of deer (8.4 million kg per year; see Appendix 6). Also, previous research using this ruminant Bacteroides test for private wells showed that the genetic signatures all matched bacteria from cattle manure (Borchardt et al. 2021). Wells for Objective 2 were selected from those that previously tested positive for total coliforms or had high nitrate, but the tests for fecal source do not identify the source s of nitrate and total coliforms in these wells because 1) total coliforms can originate from non-fecal sources , and the MST tests only identify fecal sources, 2) nitrate can originate from chemical fertilizer that is not associated with human wastewater or livestock manure, 3) multiple contamination sources can affect a single well (including sources that were not tested), and 4) contamination sources can change over time (i.e., over the months since the original synoptic sampling events) . A manifestation of these facts is that fecal markers were not detected in 60 of the 138 wells despite the presence of total coliforms or high nitrate during the synoptic sampling. Conclusions Human, bovine, and porcine fecal sources contributed to private well contamination, and human wastewater markers occurred most frequently . Septic systems and manure are common sources of the fecesborne microbes detected . Results from this objec tive identify fecal sources of contamination but not non -fecal sources, and not all wells were positive for a source -specific fecal marker. 21 Objective 3 Objective Analyze private well samples collected for Objective 2 for genes specific to certain pathogens. Approach: Sample collection and analysis Samples collected for Objective 2 (n = 138) were tested for the fecesborne pathogens listed in Table 4 using genetic tests . Wells were randomly selected from those positive for total coliforms or high nitrate (NO 3--N >10 mg/L) . Sample collection and analysis are described in Objective 2 and Appendix 3. Key finding s Pathogens were detected in 66 of 138 wells (48% ; Table 4) . Some of the pathogens can only infect humans, while others can be passed between humans and animals (\"zoonotic\"). Zoonotic pathogens were detected frequently . Because the same pathogen type can infect animals and humans, their source is unknown. The health risk associated with pathogen presenc e in private wells depends on the pathogen type, the concentration of pathogens in the well, the quantity of water consumed, the presence of water treatment, and the susceptibility of the individuals exposed. Context and interpretation Pathogen sources . Pathogen presence in private wells depends on proximity to fecal sources and whether the fecal sources contain pathogens (i.e., whether the humans or animals were infected) . Some of the pathogens detected in these private wells only infect people and therefo re originated in human wastewater . In most cases, however, the pathogen source was ambiguous because the particular pathogen can be found in fecal material from humans, livestock, or wildlife. Regardless of the source, the pathogens detected are fecesborne and indicate fecal contamination. Combined with the wastewater and manure results in Objective 2, a total of 106 wells (79%) were positive for fecal microbes . The percentage of wells positive for fecal microbes does not represent the percentage of wells contaminated in the study area because wells tested for Objectives 2 and 3 were selected from wells that had previously tested positive for indicator bacteria or high nitrate. Health risk . Pathogens in drinking water represent a potential risk of illness, and consumption of untreated groundwater (including drinking water from private wells) is recognized as a risk factor for waterborne disease (Craun et al. 2010; Wallender et al. 2014) . Determining the level of risk associated with the pathogen measurements was beyond the scope of the study, though other studies provide context for these results . Pathogens were present in 16% of wells sampled in 41 North American studies (Hynds et al. 2014) . Fewer pathogens (2 to 3) were included in those 41 studies than in the current study . Twenty pathogen tests were included by Borchardt et al. (2021) in Kewaunee County, and 32 of 131 22 private wells (24%) tested positive for a pathogen . Health risk from these pathogens was estimated to exceed the U.S. health benchmark for pu blic drinking water, which is 1 infection per 10,000 people per year: per 10,000 Kewaunee County residents that drink private well water, 260 were estimated to become ill annually (Burch et al. 2021). The pathogen tests are used for research and are not routinely available to homeowners, but total coliforms and E. coli are commonly used to assess the sanitary quality of private well water. Well samples negative for total coliforms have a high probability of being negative for pathogens as well (Stokdyk et al. 2020; Fout et al. 2017) . In contrast, the presence of total coliforms in a sample does not necessarily indicate the presence of pathogens (Stokdyk et al. 2020; Fout et al. 2017), though is indicative of microbiological contamination; Wisconsin DNR s uggests protective measures when private wells test positive for indicator bacteria (WDNR 2017) . The sanitary quality of well water can change, so regular testing has been recommended (Atherholt et al. 2015; Murphy et al. 2020; WDNR 2017). Table 4. Pathogen occurrence in 138 private wells sampled in four events (34 or 35 wells per event) . Pathogen Number of positive wells April (n = 35) August (n = 34) November (n = 34) March (n = 35) Total (n = 138) Campylobacter jejuni 0 3 0 0 3 Cryptosporidium hominisa 1 3 4 0 8 Cryptosporidium parvum 2 4 2 0 8 Cryptosporidium species 1 5 7 16 29 Giardia duodenalis assemblage B 0 0 0 1 1 Hepatitis E virus 0 0 0 0 0 Human adenovirus groups A -Fa 2 0 0 0 2 Human enterovirusa 1 0 0 0 1 Human polyomavirusa 0 0 0 0 0 Norovirus genogroup Ia 0 0 0 0 0 Norovirus genogroup II 0 1 0 1 2 Pathogenic E. coli 0 0 0 0 0 Rotavirus group A 3 0 4 2 9 Rotavirus group C 0 1 0 1 2 Salmonella 7 2 2 2 13 Shiga toxin 1 -producing bacteria 0 1 0 0 1 Shiga toxin 2 -producing bacteria 0 0 0 0 0 Any pathogenb 13 19 16 18 66 Note: While tests identified pathogen -specific genes, pathogen names are listed for clarity of presentation . Two genes were tested for rotavirus group A and Salmonella. aIndicates pathogens that infect only humans ; others can infect humans and animals . bThe number of positive wells for any pathogen does not equal the sum of individual pathogens because some wells were positive for multiple pathogens. 23 Strengths and limitations The samples tested for pathogens were collected for Objective 2, so the additional pathogen analyses add information by building on the existing sample collection effort and cost. A significant strength of Objective 3 is that m any pathogens were included (19 pathogen genetic tests), providing a diverse assessment of pathogen occurrence . Pathogen occurrence studies for groundwater typically include few pathogens (an average of 2 to 3; Hynds et al. 2014) . Like Objective 2, seasonal events were included so that wells were sampled throughout the year, and comparison of seasons is limited because there was a single sampling event for each . The tests used for Objective 3 identify pathoge ns by their genetic material (e.g., DNA) and are therefore very accurate, but the tests do not distinguish between living and dead pathogens . Finally, pathogen presence in private wells indicates the potential for health risk, but determining the specific risk of illness requires additional data. Conclusions The presence of pathogen genes in private well water indicates a potential but unquantified health risk . The pathogens may originate in human wastewater and livestock manure, but the specific source of pathogens was often unknown. 24 Objective 4 Objective Assess well construction and geologic characteristics (e.g., well age, bedrock depth) that are related to well contamination. Approach: Data and statistics A variety of factors were examined for their re lationships with well contamination. Well characteristics were obtained from well construction reports . Well siting data, like elevation and slope, were obtained from existing data sets using geographic information systems (GIS) . Geologic factors were iden tified using well construction reports and geologic maps . Rainfall, groundwater depth, and groundwater recharge were characterized for the period preceding sample collection . Appendix 7 includes a complete list of risk factors. Statistical tests identified associations among risk factors and well contamination by total coliforms, nitrate, and fecesborne microbes (Figure 11 ). Risk factors were related to two types of contaminant measurements, detection (yes or no) and concentration. Tests of association were performed separately for wells sampled in the November and April synoptic events; wells sampled for fecesborne microbes in the four seasonal events were analyzed together . Appendix 4 describes the statistical analyses . Tables 5 - 9 report the risk factors that were statistically identified and had a plausible association with contamination (factors not listed were not associated with contamination) . In addition, Tables 10 - 12 report the probability of contamination at the minimum and maximum observ ed values of each factor, which illustrates the range of estimated contamination probabilities associated with the factor. Figure 11. Organization of statistical tests that relate measurements of contaminants in private wells to contamination risk factors. For example, both the detection and concentration of nitrate in well water samples collected in November 2018 were related to well depth, a risk factor in the well characteristics category . Rainfall and groundwater were included with human wastewater and livestock manure markers because they varied across the 4 seasonal events , while samples for total coliforms and nitrate were collected over a short period (2 days) during which rainfall and groundwater varied little. 25 Key finding s Contamination of priva te wells by nitrate, total coliforms, and fec esborne microbes was associated with well characteristics, well siting , geology , rainfall, and groundwater levels (Tables 5 - 9). The identified risk factors are related to contaminant transport (i.e., movement of the contaminant from the land surface to groundwater) . Factors for nitrate, total coliforms, and fecesborne microbes can differ because they can behave differently when moving to groundwater and because t heir sources can differ. Contamination was greater for wells that were older, shallower, and had shorter casings (for example, Figure 12) . Contamination was greater for wells completed in the fractured carbonate upper aquifer and wells that cross -connected the upper and lower aquifers. Figure 12. The probability of NO 3--N exceeding 10 mg/L decreases as well depth increases . The probability is 35% at the shallowest well depths and 2% at the deepest (the data and pictured trend are for the April 2019 synoptic event) . The blue line represents the estimated trend for the association; red lines are 95% confidence limits (range we are confident the true probabilities lie within). Context and interpretation Well characteristics . Well characteristics, like age and depth, have been identified as important factors for contamination in some studies (e.g., Allevi et al. 2013), while they were unimportant in other studies (e.g., Won et al. 2013) . Differences in geologic settings may affect the i mportance of well characteristics . In Kewaunee County, for example, well characteristics were not often associated with contamination, likely because the geological characteristics of the aquifer are generally similar over the course of its depth (Borchard t et al. 2021) . In contrast, well characteristics were associated with contamination in southwest Wisconsin, where the geology is complex and variable (Carter et al. 2011; Muldoon et al. 2021) . Well depth, casing depth, and length of casing into bedrock we re associated with contamination by nitrate and total coliforms; casing length below water table was important for total coliforms but not nitrate . These well characteristics were inversely associated with 26 contamination (e.g., contamination decreased as well depth increased) . The effect of depth may reflect the dilution or dispersion (spreading out) of contaminants as they travel downward. Likewise, the concentration of human wastewater markers was greater when the depth to groundwater was shallower, as shallow depths produce shorter distances from septic systems to groundwater . In addition, contamination increased with well age, which may reflect deterioration or changes in well construction practices over time (e.g., well depth, grouting) . Because well characteristics are correlated (e.g., deeper wells tend to have deeper well casing), the well characteristic most responsible for driving contamination is not easily disti nguished . Nonetheless, results show that well characteristics were associated with contamination. Geology . Geology is recognized as an important factor for groundwater contamination because water and contaminants move more readily through some materials than others . The geology of southwest Wisconsin includes various bedrocks and multiple aquifers (Carter et al. 2011; Muldoon et al. 2021) . Two geologic factors were associated with private well contamination: topmost bedrock and geology at the well's open interval (the well length between the casing bottom and the bottom of the well) . First, contamination, especially nitrate, was greatest where the Sinnipee Group was the topmost bedrock . The Sinnipee Group contains fractured carbonate rocks that allow rapid flow of water and contaminants . Second, contamination was greater for wells open to the upper aquifer, which is primarily comprised of the Sinnipee Group, while wells completed in the lower aquifer tended to be less contaminated. Wells that cross -connected the upper and lower aquifers (i.e., wells that draw water from both aquifers) also had greater contamination. Bedrock depth. B edrock depth is central to recent revisions to the Wisconsin Administrative Code that regulates manure application (Wis. Admin. C ode \u00a7 NR 151.075) . The revisions apply to areas in eastern Wisconsin with fractured bedrock (Silurian dolomite) and shallow bedrock depth (less than 20 feet) . As demonstrated by Borchardt et al. (2021) in Kewaunee County, bedrock depth is a primary factor for contamination of wells by nitrate, total coliforms, livestock manure, and human wastewater. Interpreting the statistics Three elements are used to interpret the statistics for Objectives 4 & 5: 1. The p- value describes the likelihood that the association is real, with lower values indicating higher likelihood. Only risk factors with a reasonable level of certainty (p-value less than 0.15) were included in Tables 5 - 18. 2. The trend describes the association between the risk factor and contamination . As the value of the risk factor increases (like well depths going from shallow to deep) , contamination can either increase (positive t rend) or decrease (negative trend). 3. The probability of contamination at the minimum and maximum observed values of each risk factor illustrates the range of estimated contamination probabilities associated with the risk factor (Tables 10 - 12 & 16 - 18). Example: high nitrate in April The p-value of less than 0.001 indicates that the association between well depth and high nitrate is likely real (Table 7). The trend is negative, so the probability of contamination decreases as well depth increases: from 35% at the shallowest well depths to 2% at the deepest (Table 10). In comparison, the trend for well age and high nitrate is positive, so the probability of contamination is greatest (43%) for the oldest wells, which is greater than the probability for the shallowest wells. 27 However, bedrock depth was not consistently associated with contamination in southwest Wisconsin: bedrock depth was associated with total coliforms and h uman wastewater but not nitrate and livestock manure. Why were there differences? Livestock manure contamination may have been unrelated to bedrock depth in this study because there were too few positive samples to identify a relationship . More samples were positive for total coliforms and human wastewater markers . Numerous samples were also positive for nitrate, so the absence of a relationship with bedrock depth may result from differences in the contaminants (microbes versus chemical) or from geological considerations . Wells located in the Sinnipee Group had greater nitrate contamination than wells in other geologic units, so bedrock type was important for nitrate contamination. The effect of bedrock depth may be less apparent because most wells had shallow bedrock depths, and there were few wells with deeper depths for comparison. For example, in Kewaunee County, Borchardt et al. (2021) observed that high nitrate was more likely for wells with bedrock depth of 20 feet or less, which included approximately half the wells in that study . In contrast, 85% of wells tested for this study had bedrock depth of 20 feet or less . Unlike microbes, nitrate is highly mobile , so the limited range in bedrock depth among the study wells may preclude the identifi cation of a relationship . Well siting . The well siting factors elevation, slope, and soil hydrologic group were also associated with contamination . The association with elevation may reflect variation in contamination by general location (e.g., uplands and river bottoms) or from specific topographic influences (e.g., steep ridges) . Soil hydrologic group reflects the tendency for water to infiltrate to groundwater versus run off the surface (NRCS 1996), and slope may likewise affect the infiltration or runoff of water . As factors related to contaminant transport, slope and hydrologic soil group identify well siting conditions that may be prone to contamination. For example, nitrate contamination was associated with flatter slopes and poorly drained soils . The specific mechanisms by which the well siting factors may affect contamination are not always clear, but their significance indicates that factors related to contaminant transport are important. Strengths and limitations The statistical tests included many wells, many factors, and multiple contamination outcomes, providing a comprehensive assessment of factors associated with private well contamination. These results identify statistical associations among contamination and risk factors. They do not identi fy cause and effect, though the factors identified do have plausible relationships with groundwater contamination. Each risk factor was examined independently (without accounting for the effect of other factors), and some factors are likely to be intercor related . For example, the important well siting factors (slope, elevation, and soil group) may be correlated with land use practices or the underlying geology. Further evaluation of each important risk factor that accounts for the effect of other risk fact ors may refine our understanding of these relationships. When a specific risk factor is associated with greater contamination, the finding applies to the three -county private wells as a group . For example, results indicate that high nitrate is 28 more likely for shallow wells, but this does not mean that all wells that are shallow will have high nitrate . Risk factors should be interpreted in terms of probability of contamination, not as absolutes. Conclusions Private well water quality was associated with factors related to contaminant transport and groundwater vulnerability, including well characteristics, well siting, geology, and groundwater depth. It is unlikely that any single factor accounts for all private well contamination because m any factors were associated with the presence and concentration of contaminants 29 Tables with important risk factors by sampling event : well characteristics, well siting, geology, rainfall, and groundwater levels Note: Factors not listed were not associat ed with contamination , except when multiple risk factors of the same type were important (e.g., slope within 750, 1500, and 3000 feet of a well) , only the one with the strongest association was listed.

Contamination probability was greater for the Ancell (St. Peter sandstone) (47%) than for others (25%) 37 Objective 5 Objective Identify land use factors and potential contamination sources (e.g., number of nearby septic systems, distance to an agricultural field) related to well contamination. Approach: Data and statistics Land use surrounding wells was examined for relationships with well contamination. Septic systems were identified from county records, farms were identified from aerial imagery, and cultivated land was identified using data from U.S. Department of Agriculture (Muldoon et al. 2021) . Land use was characterized within 750, 1500, and 3000 feet of each well, including the number of septic systems (all types, including holding tanks), number of drainfield septic systems (only those designed to release effluent), and the area of cultivated land. In addition, each well's proximity (i.e., closest distance) to contamination sources was determined . For example, the distance from each well to the nearest farm was determined . Appendix 7 includes a complete lis t of risk factors. Statistical modeling identified associations among contamination and land use risk factors as described in Objective 4 . Technical procedures are described in Borchardt et al. (2021) and are summarized in Appendix 4. Tables 13 - 15 report the risk factors that were statistically identified and had a plausible association with contamination . In addition, Tables 16 - 18 report the probability of contamination at the minimum and maximum observed values of each factor, which illustrates the range of estimated contamination probabilities associated with the factor. Key finding s Agricultural land use was associated with contamination of wells by nitrate, total coliforms, and livestock manure markers. Septic systems were associated with contamination by human wastewater markers. Factors for nitrate, total coliforms, and fecesborne microbes can differ because their sources can differ and because they can behave differently when moving to groundwater. Con text and interpretation Nitrate and total coliforms . Agricultural land use was associated with contamination by nitrate and, to a lesser extent, total coliforms . The area of cultivated land around a well, the distance to cultivated land, and the distance to the nearest livestock farm were associated with nitrate and/or total coliforms (for example, Figure 13 ). However, septic systems were not associated with an increased probability of contamination by nitrate or total coliforms . For private wells in Kewaun ee County, Borchardt et al. (2021) also found that agricultural land use, but not septic systems, was associated with contamination by nitrate and total coliforms. 38 Figure 13. Top panel: The p robability of NO 3--N exceeding 10 mg/L increases as the area of cultivated land within 750 feet of the well increases (the 750 -foot radius contains 40 acres (ac)) . The probability is 5% if there are 0 acres and 55% if there are 37 acres (the data and pictured trend are for the November 2018 synoptic even t). Bottom panel: The probability of total coliforms detection increases if wells are closer to a livestock farm excluding hobby farms (in miles (mi)). The probability is 13% at the longest distance and 38% at the shortest distance (the data and pictured t rend are for the November 2018 synoptic event ). The blue line represents the estimated trend for the association; red lines are 95% confidence limits (range we are confident the true probabilities lie within). Human wastewater . Sixty -four of 138 wells (46%) were positive for human wastewater markers, and the number of nearby septic systems and the distance to the nearest septic system drainfield were associated with this contamination (Table 15) . For example, the probability of contamination was greater if the nearest neighbor's drainfield septic system was closer (Figure 14; distances excluded septic systems on the same parcel as the well) . Likewise, the probability of contamination increased from 44% (when one septic system was within 750 feet of the well) to a probability of 79% (when 18 septic systems were within 750 feet; counts included systems on the same parcel as the well) . The fact that human wastewater contaminates wells when only a few septic systems are nearby illustrates the vulnerability of groundwater, especially when groundwater depths are shallow (Table 9) . Initially there appeared to be an association of human wastewater contamination with land -applied waste . However, the distances of the association were over 12 miles, much farther than groundwater is known to flow in the region, and the association was non -existent or weak at plausible distances . The association between human wastewater contamination and septic 39 systems was stronger, consistent with the fact that numerous septic systems were located between these fields and study wells . Also, the volume of land -applied waste was much less than the volume of septic system effluent. Septic systems are a consistent fecal source because they have fixed locations and continually release effluent. Figure 14. The p robability of detecting a human fecal marker increases if wells are closer to a neighbor's drainfield septic system (in feet (ft)) . The probability is 27% at the longest distance and 56% at the shortest distance (distances exclude septic systems on the same parcel as the well) . The blue line represents the estimated trend for the association; red lines are 95% confidence limits (range we are confident the true prob abilities lie within). Livestock manure . In contrast to septic systems, livestock manure is an intermittent fecal source because the timing, location, and quantity of manure on the landscape vary with application and grazing schedules . Because manure appl ication data were not available, we used general assessments of agricultural land (cultivated land and farm locations), which do not always correspond to manure presence. Associations among agricultural land use and the detection (i.e., the presence) of ma nure contamination were not identified, but associations were identified with the concentration of livestock manure markers . Manure is not always present on all fields, which complicates the identification of associations based on presence/absence (i.e., detection) . In contrast, when manure markers were present in wells, concentrations were associated with agricultural land use . Manure markers must be present in a well to measure their concentration, and the presence of manure markers in a well indicates that manure was nearby . Borchardt et al. (2021) made the same observation for private wells in Kewaunee County, as that study also identified associations among agricultural land use and the concentration (but not presence) of manure markers. Many factors can affect groundwater quality . Groundwater quality is affected by factors related to the transport and sources of contaminants. Objective 4 examined factors related to contaminant transport --that is, the tendency of contaminants to reach groundwater or enter wells. The land use factors examined for Objective 5 represent potential contaminant sources --places where contaminants may originate. Some factors may be related. For example, geolo gy may be correlated with slope or land use. Because many transport and source factors can play a role, individual factors may be best considered in the context of the others. Objectives 4 & 5 can be a tool to understand the source and transport factors r elated to private well contamination: Factors in Objective 4 may help describe areas or conditions more or less prone to contamination. Factors in Objective 5 describe relationships between contamination and potential sources. 40 Strengths and limitations The statistical tests included many wells, many factors, and multiple contamination outcomes, providing a comprehensive assessment of factors associated with private well contamination. These results identify statistical associations among con tamination and risk factors. They do not identify cause and effect, though the factors identified do have plausible relationships with groundwater contamination. Each risk factor was examined independently (without accounting for the effect of other facto rs), and some factors are likely to be intercorrelated . Further evaluation of each important risk factor that accounts for the effect of other risk factors may refine our understanding of these relationships. The relationship between risk factors and contamination are specific and quantitative . For example, the relationships show how contamination increases for each additional septic system near a well or for each additional acre of cultivated land near a well. When a specific risk factor is associated with greater contamination, the finding applies to the three -county private wells as a group . For example, results indicate that high nitrate is more likely for wells near cultivated land, but this does not mean that all wells that are near cultivated land will have high nitrate . Risk factors should be interpreted in terms of probability of contamination, not as absolutes. Conclusions Land use surrounding private wells was associated with contamination. Contamination by nitrate, total coliforms, and livestock manure markers was associated with agricultural land use. Contamination by human wastewater markers was associated with septic systems . The relationships between these factors and contamination may inform effo rts to address water quality. 41 Tables with important risk factors by sampling event : land use Factors not listed were not associated with contamination , except: when multiple risk factors of the same type were important (e.g., the area of cultivated land within 750, 1500, and 3000 feet of a well) , only the one with the strongest association was listed.

The percentage of study wells with total coliforms or high nitrate was generally greater than statewide percentages . Human wastewater and livestock manure contributed to private well contamination, and pathogen genes were also detected. The study identified many factors that were associated with private well contamination, including land use, geology, and well characteristics . The f actors will be further examined using sophisticated statistical approaches to provide additional insights that will be reported in a scientific journal. By assessing the extent, sources, and factors related to privat e well contamination, the study provides a detailed characterization of private well drinking water quality for the residents of southwest Wisconsin.

Science of the Total Environment. 490:1082 -90. 48 Appendices Appendix 1: Description of total coliforms, coli , and nitrate Total coliforms, E. coli , and nitrate were selected to determine the extent of contamination (Objective 1) because they are standard tests for drinking water quality that are readily available and amenable to the testing of many samples in a short period . Total coliforms are a group of bacteria that include E. coli , and both are used as indicators of water sanitary quality (USEPA 2022) . Total coliform bacteria found in groundwater originate from both fecal and nonfecal sources and are therefore a general indicator of sanitary quality, while E. coli are generally associated with fecal sources and therefore indicate fecal pollution (USEPA 2022) . Most total coliform bacteria and E. coli are not pathogenic (they do not cause illness), so they are indicative of potential issues of sanitary quality but not necessarily of health risk (USEPA 2022). The maximum contaminant level goal for these bacteria is zero per 100 mL (that is, any detection of these bacteria is an exceedance of the goal; USEPA 2022) . Nitrate in groundwater originates from fecal material (e.g., wastewater or manure), and unlike bacteria, it also originates from chemical fertilizers . Agricultural sources of nitrogen, like manure and fertilizer, exceed human waste sources in the three counties (Byrnes et al. 2020) . Low levels of nitrate can also occur naturally, while concentrations greater than 1 to 3 mg NO 3--N per L typically indicate anthropogenic influence, like fertilizers, manure, and wastewater (Luczaj and Masarik 2015; Madison and Brunett 1985 ). The maximum contaminant level for nitrate is 10 mg NO 3--N per L, and chronic exposure to high nitrate levels can result in adverse health outcomes (USEPA 2022; WI DNR 2010) . The maximum contaminant for total coliforms, E. coli , and nitrate are from the U.S. National Primary Drinking Water Standards and apply only to public wells, but they provide public health benchmarks and are consistent with state groundwater quality standards (WDNR 2010; WDNR NB. 2020.

Register June 2021 No. 786. 50 Appendix 2: Geology of the study area Bedrock in the study area consists of a thick package of sedimentary rocks that outcrop in steep -sided stream valleys and hillslopes (Figures A1 and A2). The Sinnipee Group, which consists of the Galena, Decorah, and Platteville Formations, is the uppermost bedrock unit in the majority of the study area and forms a broad upland pla teau south of Military Ridge (Figure A1). The younger Maquoketa Shale and Silurian dolomite are restricted to scattered \"mounds\" in the area. A conceptual model that includes two groundwater systems (upper and lower aquifers) was used for this study . The S innipee Group rocks make up the \"upper aquifer\" in the study area and are separated from the underlying St. Peter Sandstone by the Glenwood Shale, which acts as an aquitard and limits the downward migration of groundwater. The \"lower aquifer\" consists of t he St. Peter Sandstone, the Prairie du Chien Group, the Trempealeau Group containing the Jordan sandstone and the St. Lawrence dolomite, and underlying sandstones of Cambrian age. The bedrock units comprising the \"lower aquifer\" are exposed north of Military Ridge and in the larger stream valleys south of Military Ridge . Carbonate bedrock is within 50 feet of the surface in much of the study area (Figure A3). Except on the steep sides of valleys, the bedrock units are capped by unconsolidated surficial dep osits (Figure A2). Where carbonate rocks are the uppermost bedrock unit, the Rountree Formation is sometimes present directly atop the bedrock. The Rountree consists of the residual weathering products from dissolution of the underlying carbonates, and the texture varies from clayey to sandy clay. Quaternary sediments above the Rountree consist primarily of wind -blown loess on the bedrock uplands. Colluvium and rare landslide deposits occur over bedrock on the valley sides. Alluvium, consisting of sand and gravel, occurs in the valley bottoms (Carson 2012 ). Figure A1. Bedrock geologic map of the study area (from Mudrey et al. 1982). 51 Figure A2. Cross section illustrating both surficial and bedrock geologic units as exposed in a typical stream valley in the study area; colors are similar to those in the bedrock geologic map in Figure A1. Diagrams to the left show the relationship of the upper and lower aquifers that are separated by the Glenwood Shale. Water levels in deep wells finished in the lower aquifer can stand far below water levels in shallower wells finished in the upper aquifer, as illustrated at the left.

Coliforms and E. coli were measured within 30 hours of sample collection using Colilert Quanti -Trays (Idexx). Nitrate was measured by the cadmium reduction method on a Lachat QuikChem 5000 (limit of detection was 0.1 mg/L). For Objectives 2 and 3, water from an outdoor tap or pressure tank was collected in sterile 1 -L bottles, and then large -volume samples (average of 853 L) were collected using dead - end ultrafiltration (Smith and Hill 2009) . Taps were sterilized with flame prior to sample collection, and new tubing and adapters were used for each sample . For large -volume samples, microbes were eluted from ultrafilters following Smith and Hill (2009) . Samples were further concentrated by polyethylene glycol flocculation as described in Borchardt et al. (2021), and sample concentrate was stored at - 80 \u00b0C . For 1 -L samples, 10.1 mL of 2.5 M MgCl 2 were added to the sample prior to filtration through a 0.45 -micron mixed cellulose ester filter (Haramoto et al. 2012, Katayama et al. 2002), and filters were eluted using 5 mL of solution containing Na4P2O7\u00b710H 2O, C 10H13N2O8Na3\u00b73H2O, and Tween 80 . Samples were stored at -80 \u00b0C following addition of beef extract. Sample concentrate from large -volume and 1 -L samples were processed and analyzed identically . Nucleic acids were extracted from sample concentrate using a QIAcube\u00ae (Qiagen, Valencia, CA) as described by Borchardt et al. (2021), and virus RNA was reverse -transcribed using random hexamers as described by Borchardt et al. (2021) . Samples were analyzed by quantitative polymerase chain reaction (qPCR) in duplicate using a LightCycler\u00ae 480 (Roche Diagnostics) for the assays reported in Borchardt et al. (2021) . In addition, samples were analyzed for hepatitis E virus (Jothikumar et al. 2006; Garson et al. 2012), porcine adenovirus (Hundesa et el. 2009), porcine epidemic diarrhea virus (Miller et al. 2016), Pig -1-Bacteroidales (Mieszkin et al. 2009), and Pig -2-Bacteroidales (Mieszkin et al. 2009). Negative controls for secondary concentration, extraction, reverse transcription , and qPCR were analyzed with samples and must exhibit no cycle of quantifica tion value . Modified live virus vaccines were used for DNA (bovine herpes virus) and RNA (bovine respiratory syncytial virus ) extraction positive controls, with the latter serving as the reverse transcription positive control, and were evaluated qualitativ ely. Ultramers\u00ae or Minigenes (Integrated DNA Technology) were used as qPCR positive controls for each target and must yield C q values within 1 cycle of the expected value . qPCR and reverse transcription -qPCR inhibition were evaluated as described in Borchardt et al. (2021); inhibited samples were diluted with AE buffer (Qiagen) prior to qPCR.

(2021), available at https://ehp.niehs.nih.gov/doi/full/10.1289/EHP7813 . Risk factors were evaluated for their association with the probability of contaminant detection using log -binomial regression and the contaminant concentration using gamma regression with a natural log link function. Significant risk factors were identified based on three criteria: 1) strength of association, 2) plausibility, and 3) consistency. The model p- value was used for criterion 1, where lower p -values indicate stronger associations . For an association to be plausible it must be biologically or physically possible (e.g., it's plausible that increasing the number of nearby septic systems increases well contamination, but it is not plausible that decreasing the number of nearby septic systems increases contamination) . Consistency refers to risk factors of the same type but different levels having similar trends (e.g., the number of septic systems within 750, 1500, and 3000 feet of a well are different levels of the same risk factor and should exhibit similar trends) . When multiple risk factors of the same type were significant, the one with the strongest association was report ed. Interpretation of the statistical results requires three elements . First, the p -value, which ranges from 0 to 1, describes the l ikelihood that the association is real, with lower values indicating higher likelihood . For example, a p - value of 0.10 indicates a 10% chance that the observed association was random. Only risk factors that were associated with contamination at a reasonabl e level (p < 0.15) are included in Tables 5 - 18. Second, the trend describes the association between the risk factor and contamination: a positive trend indicates that contamination increases as the value of the risk factor increases, while a negative tre nd indicates that contamination increases as the value of the risk factor decreases . Third, Tables 10 - 12 and Tables 16 - 18 report the probability of contamination at the minimum and maximum observed values of each risk factor, which illustrates the range of estimated contamination probabilities associated with the risk factor. All risk factors identified as significant using univariable modeling have a plausible association with contamination. Multivariable analyses can evaluate each important risk factor in the presence of the other important risk factors (i.e., adjusting for the effect of other risk factors), which may refin e our understanding of the univariable associations. Multivariable statistics: the next step Many factors were related to private well contamination. Factors were identified using a standard approach that examines one factor at a time. More sophisticated approaches, called \" multivariable statistics ,\" are useful for examining each factor while accounting for the others. Multivariable statistics can identify inter -relationships among factors and their relative importance. Factors will be further examined using multivariable statistics to provide addit ional insights that go beyond the 5 study objectives covered in this report. Findings will be reported in a scientific journal. 56 References Borchardt MA, Stokdyk JP, Kieke Jr BA, Muldoon MA, Spencer SK, Firnstahl AD, Bonness DE, Hunt RJ, Burch TR. 2021.

Assuming an average daily per capita water usage (including bathing, laundry, etc.) of 48 gallons (Maupin et al. 2016), septic systems in the study area release 2.6 billion liters (687 million gal) of effluent per year. According to county records, the majority (90%) of private septic systems in the study area are designed to release effluent to the subsurface (i.e., to a drainfield or mound), whereas few (2%) are holding tanks from which wastewater is pumped and subsequently treated. System type was unknown for 8%. The primary livestock in the study area include c attle, pigs, and poultry. All livestock counts are based on the USDA -NASS 2017 Census of Agriculture for the study area (NASS 2019) . There are 369,128 cattle (including milk cows, beef cows, and calves) that excrete an average of 66.3 kg of manure (fecal plus urine) per day (Nennich et al. 2005), totaling 8.9 billion kg per year . When converted to a volume for comparison (based on a density of 1.0 kg/L; University of Wisconsin -Extension 2015), this equals 8.9 billion L per year (2.4 billion gal) . There are 77,600 hogs and pigs that excrete an average of 5.1 kg of manure (feces plus urine) per day (ASAE 2003) . When converted to volume (based on a density of 0.99 kg/L; ASAE 2003), this equals 146 million L per year (39 million gal) . Animal mass, excrement mass, and excrement density are based on the Manure Production and Characteristics Standards from the American Society of Agricultural Engineers (ASAE 2003) for the computation of poultry manure . There are 248 turkeys in the study area that excre te 0.32 kg per day (assuming an average animal mass of 6.8 kg), which equals 29,000 L per year (based on a density of 1.0 kg/L) . There are 164,634 broilers that excrete 0.077 kg per day (assuming an average animal mass of 0.9 kg), which equals 4.6 million L per year (based on a density of 1.0 kg/L) . There are 440,964 pullets and layers that excrete 0.12 kg per day (assuming an average animal mass of 1.8 kg), which equals 19 million L per year (based on a density of 0.97 kg/L) . The sum of poultry manure is 24 million L per year (6.3 million gal) . Poultry are potential hosts of the zoonotic pathogens included in this study, but tests for poultry -specific fecal material were not included . The volume of poultry manure produced in the study area is included for r eference, and it is six times less than the volume of pig manure and over 100 times less than that of cattle manure and septic system effluent. There are 88,600 deer in the study area (WDNR 2018) that each excrete 0.26 kg/day (McCullough 1982), totaling 8.4 million kg/year (19 million lbs). The manure computations used average values for excrement, though specific e xcrement mass varies by animal size, type, and age (e.g., heifer versus lactating cow) . Likewise, excrement values were not available for pullet s, so the value for layers was used . The computations describe the amount of manure produced in the three -county area but do not account for manure that is produced elsewhere and applied in the study area or for manure that is produced in the study area and applied e lsewhere. 6061 R eferences ASAE. 2003.

Topmost bedrock and aquitard count (number of aquitards at the well location) were identified using existing geologic maps and well construction reports . Bedrock depth and open interval geology were determined for e ach well using the well construction report and existing geologic maps . Open interval geology refers to the portion of the well that is not cased, and it is an indication of which aquifer the well draws water from . There are two major aquifers in the study area, an upper and lower aquifer; some wells also draw from sand/gravel aquifers . Topmost bedrock refers to the topmost geologic group where the well is located (regardless of whether the well draws water from that unit). Well characteristics . W ell characteristics were abstracted from well construction reports, which were obtained for 74% of the study wells . Open interval length, length of casing into bedrock, length of casing into static water level, and specific capacity were derived from data in well construction reports . Wells without construction reports were not included in risk factor tests for these factors. Well siting. Ele vation at the land surface was from the 10-meter digital elevation model obtained fro m Wisconsin DNR ( https://data -wi-dnr.opendata.arcgis.com/search?q=elevation ). Slope of the land surface was calculated from the 10 -meter digital elevation model and identified for each well using ESRI ArcMap (ESRI 2011); slope was also characterized as the average and maximum within 750 feet, 1500 feet, and 3000 feet of each well . Soil hydrologic group was from the USDA Natural Resources Conservation Service's Soil Survey (ssurgo), obtained from the USDA Geospatial Data Gateway ( https://datagateway.nrcs.usda.gov/ ). Soil hydrologic group is an assessment of soil drainage that describes the tendency for water to infiltrate or run off (NRCS 1996). Surficial sediment (coarse or fine) was obtained from well construction reports. Groundwater and rainfall. Q uantitative precipitation estimates (QPE) were provided by the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration for each well (QPE data are generated on a 2 km x 2 km grid) . Snowfall was excluded from precipitation totals by cross -referencing snowfall data from a local weather station (National Climatic Data Center) . Groundwater levels were from three groundwater monitoring wells in the study area located in differing hydrogeologic settings and are open to different geologic units: one was open to the lower aquifer , one was open to the upper aquifer (also referred to as the Galena -Platteville aquifer) without Maquoketa Shale, and one was open to the upper aquifer and was overlain by the Maquoketa Shale . Groundwater recharge was determined using the Water Table Fluctuation method (Healy and Cook 2002). Agriculture . The distance from each well to the edge of the nearest cultivated field was determined . The area of cultivated land within 750, 1500, and 3000 feet of each well was also determined; these three radii w ere selected a priori based on previous work (Borchardt et al. 2003; Borchardt et al. 2021) . Cultivated land was from USDA's 2019 National Cultivated Layer (obtained from USDA NASS at www.nass.usda.gov/Research_and_Science/Cropland/Release/index.php), whic h bases the designation of cultivated land on crop data from 2015 to 2019. Farm locations were identified from aerial imagery based on evidence of livestock as described in Muldoon et al. (2021) . A subset of farms excluded farms with evidence of lesser livestock presence and was referred to as \"Livestock farms excluding hobby farms.\" Livestock 64 f arm point locations were based on the primary farm structures . Distance from each well to the nearest livestock farm was determined . ESRI ArcMap (ESRI 2011) was used for spatial analyses. Septic systems . Septic system locations for Lafayette County were from an existing county GIS layer. Septic system GIS layers were developed for Grant and Iowa Counties using county records as described in Muldoon et al. (2021) . A subset of septic systems with drainfields was created using data from county records . The count of septic systems within 750, 1500, and 3000 feet of each well was determined . The distance to the nearest neighbor's septic system was determined (excluded septic systems on the same parcel as the well) . ESRI ArcMap was used for spatial analyses. Land- applied waste . Point locations of permitted waste application sites were provided by Wisconsin DNR . Points were located near the site cente r.
