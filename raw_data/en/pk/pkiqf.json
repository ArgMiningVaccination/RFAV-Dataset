I spent years searching for answers for my own personal health issues. I suffered with debilitating menstrual problems from the time I was 12 years old which caused me to miss 1 to 2 days of school each month because of severe vomiting, diarrhea, excruciating cramps, extremely heavy flow, dizziness etc. It was like having the flu each and every month and it didn't get easier as I got older and I was having to miss time from work each month. When I was around 20 I went on birth control pills which did help with most of the symptoms, but it created a whole new world of health issues and I did not want to be on drugs every day for numerous years of my life, so I started looking at alternatives. I found my wonderful Naturopathic Doctor and other alternative medicines and therapies which helped dramatically with most of my problems but nothing could quite fix everything. Then I discovered the power of essential oils and my menstrual issues are gone. I found these oils so fascinating that I had to learn more. This lead me to study to become a Clinical Aromatherapist and changing careers completely and I have never been happier. I still work with my Naturopath and other natural therapies and of course, allopathic medicine also has its time and place. Essential oils are a complimentary medicine that work harmoniously with other wellness treatments, including modern western medicine. After much trial and error during my studies, I have developed my own personal essential oils blend/synergy that has changed my life. I no longer suffer each month and my menstrual cycle does not control every aspect of my life. I no longer miss out on weddings and parties and life. Aromatherapy is a holistic therapy and looks at the physical, emotional, mental and spiritual well-being of the individual and I believe that is why it has helped me so dramatically. A Clinical Aromatherapist has 610 hours of training in Plant Taxonomy, Anatomy, the chemical constituents of 100's of essential oils and the effects they have on the body. We study the proper application and contra-indications of essential oils, as well as Aromatherapy massage. I had to complete 30 Case Studies, conduct a research project and write a paper before being able to write the final exam to become a Clinical Aromatherapist. Proper training in the use of essential oils is very important because all though these oils are natural, they do have the potential to harm. Our mandate as professional Aromatherapists is the safe use of essential oils. Life leads us down different paths than we anticipate and I am grateful for where my path has lead me and I am excited to see where it goes from here. I discovered the power of essential oils kind of late in my life but I I do not want to see anyone else suffer as long as I did. My education in Clinical Aromatherapy means you will not have to spend years trying to figure out the best blend for your health needs, together, we can narrow it down much faster. I would be honoured if you would let me help you with your health issues and see if we can get you feeling happier and healthier too. In good health, Kimberly:) Kimberly White RCRT Registered Canadian Reflexology Therapist Certified Clinical Aromatherapist Certified Jikiden Reiki Practitioner "}
