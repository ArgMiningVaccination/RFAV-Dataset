{"title": "AL Detox Protocol", "author": null, "url": null, "hostname": null, "description": null, "sitename": null, "date": "2019-01-01", "cleaned_text": "This is an enormously useful protocol for a variety of conditions including Lyme disease, poisonings including from mold (which is very common in our area), neurological problems, chemical sensitivity, and Autism. We also use this protocol quite commonly when patients are ill with problems that are difficult to diagnose. [Chanca Piedra:](http://store.alchemistlab.com/products/chanca-piedra) 2 to 3 capsules before meals twice daily [Li Dan Pian:](http://store.alchemistlab.com/products/li-dan-pian-gall-bladder-support) 5 tablets before meals twice daily Toxins are gathered in the liver and secreted in the bile. Bile is then stored in the gall bladder. When you eat fats, bile is pumped through the sphincter of oddi from the gall bladder, where it helps to emulsify and digest fats in the small intestine. Bile is then reabsorbed in the ileum (the last section of the small intestine) and recycled back to the liver, along with any toxins. These herbal supplements help the liver produce more bile than can be reabsorbed, which helps break the recycling of toxins. [Membrane Complex:](http://store.alchemistlab.com/products/membrane-complex) 2 capsules twice daily before meals [Phosphatidyl Choline:](http://store.alchemistlab.com/products/phosphatidyl-choline) 2 capsules twice daily before meals The liver has more diverse functions than any other organ and contains more cellular organelles, each of which has a cellular membrane. Current research shows that toxins jam into cell membranes impairing their function, as well as spinning off odd-shaped fatty acids that viruses can use to replicate. The healthier the cell membrane, the more the cell is protected from viral invasion. Using an abundance of phospholipids allows the cells to slough off toxin-laden cell membranes and make new ones. Membrane Complex and Phosphatidyl Choline are phospholipids that constitute cellular membranes, making them highly effective in the process of detoxification. [NADH:](http://store.alchemistlab.com/products/nadh) 1 tablet 15 minutes before breakfast Along with a high dose of [Acetyl-Glutathione](http://store.alchemistlab.com/products/acetyl-glutathione). [Phosphatidyl Serine:](http://store.alchemistlab.com/products/phosphatidyl-serine-ps-100) 2 capsules twice daily before meals [Krill Oil:](http://store.alchemistlab.com/products/krill-oil) 2 capsules twice daily before meals [CMO:](https://alchemist-lab-store.myshopify.com/admin/products/93963594) 2 capsules twice daily before meals Research shows that prolonged stress damages the memory banks of the brain. Phosphatidyl Serine helps nerves heal. It also balances the effect of cortisol, which is a stress hormone on the brain. This is useful in the treatment of peripheral neuropathy as well as getting to the root of herpes infection. Krill Oil has a very unique lipid structure as it allows the tiny shrimp-like creature it comes from to survive in the freezing water of the Antarctic Ocean. Krill Oil has omega 3's integrated with Phospolipids in its structure. It is also a fabulous anti-oxidant and Hepatitis C is a disease where oxidative stress damages the liver. CMO is a supplement that was discovered by a researcher from the NIH (National Institute of Health). It is primarily used for arthritis and auto-immune problems. We find it useful for neurological issues as well. For patients with chemical sensitivities or autism, we prescribe [Acetyl-Glutathione](http://store.alchemistlab.com/products/acetyl-glutathione), along with Vitamin B6, B12, and Folic Acid to prime the methylation pathway of detoxification. [Acetyl-Glutathione:](http://store.alchemistlab.com/products/acetyl-glutathione) 3 - 6 caps every day or every other day, at anytime. Glutathione is the body's premier anti-oxidant. Having enough glutathione upregulates the body's ability to detoxify many poisons. Glutathione is also the main anti-oxidant found in liver cells. It provides the anti-oxidant protection for red blood cells, allowing red blood cells a longer lifespan and building blood counts. This also builds energy, especially for those with anemia. For people who are chemically sensitive, Acetyl-Glutathione is the main treatment that we prescribe. For people suffering from a variety of toxic exposures - including poisonous mushrooms, solvents, pesticides, and radiation - we prescribe [R+ Alpha Lipoic Acid](http://store.alchemistlab.com/products/r-alpha-lipoic-acid). At Alchemist Lab, we recommend R+ Alpha Lipoic Acid if there has been a specific solvent, paint, or pesticide exposure. We also recommend R+ Alpha Lipoic Acid when a patient cannot afford [Acetyl-Glutathione](http://store.alchemistlab.com/products/acetyl-glutathione). Standard dose of the R+ Alpha Lipoic Acid is 2 twice daily. For acute poisonings take 4 caps every 15 minutes. This is the best home antidote for poisonings. It can be given with an IV, in very high doses, as it is an extremely safe substance. "}
