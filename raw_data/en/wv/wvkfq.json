TESTIMONY OF INTERESTED INDIVIDUALS AND ORGANIZATIONS 2002 BUDGET WITNESS DR. RENEE JENKINS, PROFESSOR AND CHAIRMAN, DEPARTMENT OF PEDIATRICS AND CHILD HEALTH, HOWARD UNIVERSITY COLLEGE OF MEDICINE Mr. Regula. Let us get started. We have a lot of witnesses today, so we want to move right along. We are sorry we cannot give you more time, but that is the way it is. You won the lottery or you wouldn't even be here because our requests for testimony are about double what we are able to accommodate, but it is very helpful to even have a brief statement to give us an opportunity to understand--especially for me because I don't have time and I hate to tell you this but I am not going to be able to read all your statements completely. That is the staff's job and I am not even sure they will get through the whole thing but we will try as much as possible to evaluate all the testimony that is presented. These topics are very important on every subject, are of great interest and affect a lot of people. We understand that very well. We have the little boxes there that the green light will go, then there will be an amber light which means you have a minute and a half to wrap up and then the red light which means stop. Francine has a little buzzer that goes off, she is the enforcer. It is a challenge to get through these and we want to give everyone a chance. Sometimes we will have a few questions. I often have a lot of questions but we just don't have time to get into depth with all of them. All of these topics are very interesting and more importantly, they affect the lives of people. We want to do the best job we can in allocating the resources to achieve hopefully successes and meeting some of the challenges of the illnesses and diseases that confront us. First we have Education. Some of you will be here on education. I just saw a poll the other day that said among the American people, education is the number one issue and close behind it is health. These are subjects that are very important to people. With that, we will get started. Our first witness today is Dr. Renee Jenkins, Professor and Chairman, Department of Pediatrics and Child Health, Howard University. I would like to welcome you. Dr. Jenkins. Thank you. I am Renee Jenkins from Howard University. I have been practicing in the Washington community for 25 years. I am also the President of the D.C. Chapter of the American Academy of Pediatrics. On behalf of the American Academy of Pediatrics and our pediatric and adolescent endorsing organizations, I would like to thank the Subcommittee for the opportunity to present this statement. Today, children are generally healthier now than they were only half a generation ago. According to recent reports, the national infant mortality and child death rates and the percentage of children living in poverty have all declined and immunization coverage rates for infants and toddlers have increased. However, despite these significant improvements, there are still over ten million children and adolescents who remain uninsured. Moreover, racial and ethnic health disparities for many children and adolescents continue to exist. We, you and I, both have more to do. As a clinician, I must work hard with my colleagues to not only diagnose and treat our patients but also to promote strong interventive interventions, to improve the overall health and well being of all infants, children, adolescents and young adults. Likewise, as a policymakers, you, along with your colleagues, have an integral part to play to improve the health of the next generation through sustained and adequate funding of vital Federal programs that support these efforts. I am going to speak on three issues particularly--access, quality, and immunizations. Under access, as a child and adolescent health clinician, we believe that all children and adolescents deserve and should have full access to quality health care, from the ability to achieve primary care for the pediatrician trained in the unique needs of children to timely access to pediatric medical subspecialists and pediatric surgical specialists should the need arise. Today, federally supported initiatives such as the Maternal Child Health Block Grant, Title X Family Planning Services and the Health Professions Education Training Grants are for many communities their only access to health care. We urge you to ensure that these and other important child and adolescent health programs receive sustained and adequate funding in fiscal year 2002. Of equal importance to access to care is an equitable Federal investment in the training and education of the Nation's future pediatricians, clinical and scientists, particularly in independent teaching hospitals. A bipartisan Congress has recognized in the last two years, and you have personally supported, maintaining adequate funding to continue the education research programs and delivery of health care in these child and adolescent-centered settings is imperative. Under quality, access to health care is only the first step in protecting the health of all children and adolescents. We must make every effort to ensure that the care provided is of the highest quality. Robust Federal support for the wide array of quality improvement initiatives is needed if this goal is to be achieved. Leading the effort to develop and implement the highestquality of care through research and better application of science is the agency for Health Care Research and Quality and the NIH, National Institutes of Health. Together, these agencies provide not only scientific knowledge and basis to cure disease, improve the quality of care, but also support emerging critical issues in health care delivery. They also address the particular needs of priority populations like children and adolescents. Continued Federal sustainable funding for health research, including pediatric research in the face of new challenges and new technology is essential to continued improvements in the quality of America's health care. Over the years, NIH has made dramatic strides that directly impact on the quality of life for infants and children. I am a recipient of an NIH grant that has definitely shown in a controlled study that one can effectively postpone and reduce early sexual involvement in young girls which is important to the issue of adolescent pregnancy prevention. We are now using the results of this research to pilot a program to educate and support parents in their efforts to work with children. We join the medical research community to support the fourth installment in the doubling of the NIH budget for fiscal year 2003. Under immunization, pediatricians working alongside public health professionals and other partners have brought the United States its highest immunization coverage levels in history. As a result, disease levels are at or near record low levels. However, the public health infrastructure that now supports our national immunization efforts must not be jeopardized with insufficient funding. One of the conclusions of the June 2000 Institute of Medicine report ``Calling the Shots,'' was that unstable funding for State immunization programs threatens vaccine safety and coverage levels for specific populations. For example, adolescents continue to be adversely affected by vaccine preventable diseases such as chicken pox, Hepatitis B, measles and Rubella. Comprehensive adolescent immunization activities at the national, State and local level are needed to achieve national disease elimination goals. As a pediatrician who sees adolescents, immunizations were generally thought to be a less critical issue in this age group. However, the recent college outbreaks of meningococcal meningitis which is a life threatening infection of the brain and spinal cord have made us much more aware of the need to be vigilant about immunization protection even in this age group. While the ultimate goal of immunization is clearly the eradication of disease, the immediate goal must be the prevention of disease in individuals or groups. To this end we strongly believe that the continued investment in the efforts of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention must be sustained and increased. In conclusion, I thank you for this opportunity to provide our recommendations for the coming fiscal year. We look forward to working with you as the new Chair of this important subcommittee, and I would like to personally invite you to the Department of Pediatrics at Howard University so that you can see child and adolescent health care at work. As this subcommittee is once again faced with difficult choices and multiple priorities, we know that as in the past years, you will not forget America's children. Thank you very much. [The information follows:] [GRAPHIC(S) NOT AVAILABLE IN TIFF FORMAT] Mr. Regula. Thank you. With a couple of small grandchildren who live down the road from me in Ohio, I have heard a lot about pediatricians. We are happy to have our colleague from California, Mr. Duke Cunningham. For those of you who don't know, Duke was the only Air Force ace in the Vietnam war, so he is not only a skilled legislator, he was a very skilled pilot, and is a very valued member of this committee. Duke is going to introduce our next witness, Carolyn Nunes from San Diego. That is your home city, isn't it, Duke. You have quite a family of educators, don't you? Mr. Cunningham. Dr. Nancy Cunningham. I have two built-in lobbyists right at home. Mr. Regula. Duke takes care of education. Mr. Cunningham. I was a Navy pilot, not an Air Force pilot. Mr. Regula. And I am a Navy man. I really missed up that one. Mr. Cunningham. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. I see my colleague, Frank Purcell in the audience. I think you are probably here with the nurse anesthetists, Frank. My wife has her doctorate degree in Education. The witness I am going to introduce is the sister of my wife, my sister-in- law in charge of Special Education in San DiegoCity Schools. She works for Alan Bursin, who was a Clinton appointee in the border and now is the Superintendent. I want to tell you he has my full support. What Carolyn is going to talk about a little bit today is not just special education but education reform in five minutes, and talk about what we are trying to do. Alan Bursin is supportive of many of the Bush initiatives for the reform of education. I am very, very proud to support her boss, the Superintendent, Alan Bursin. Carolyn testified before the Oversight Committee a couple of weeks ago on special education. She is here today to do the same thing. I have seen her cry when she can't help students with special needs. Now she is an administrator but she spent 23 years in the field of education and is trying to breach the gap between schools and the parents to make sure the parents' special needs are met with their individual children, but on the other hand, trying to breach that the school systems are not bankrupted by the local trial lawyers that are ripping off, in my opinion, the school systems and the parents. There are only two areas in which we should have caps. One is trial lawyers and the other I will leave to you to decide what it is. Carolyn has been a special education teacher and an administrator. This is the second year of implementation of the blueprint for student success that her boss, Alan Bursin, has presented. I want to tell you that on the D.C. Committee we capped lawyer fees. To give you an example, we saved $12 million. Instead of going to lawyers, it went to the children with special needs. We have done that for two terms. We hired 23 special education specialists, speech pathologists, hearing specialists, sighted specialists, and I want you to listen very carefully because we need a change in special education. Carolyn is the expert in all of San Diego City schools to bring that to you. It is my honor to introduce my sister-in-law, Carolyn Nunes. ---------- Wednesday, March 21, 2001. TESTIMONY OF PUBLIC WITNESSES 2002 BUDGET WITNESS CAROLYN NUNES, SPECIAL EDUCATION PROGRAM MANAGER, SAN DIEGO UNIFIED SCHOOL DISTRICT Ms. Nunes. Thank you. Today, my testimony focuses on some needed reforms to special education law and services in San Diego Unified School District and the Nation's school districts. Large scale reform efforts are not unfamiliar to San Diego City Schools. Currently, the District is in its first year of implementation of the Blueprint for Student Success. The reform strategies included in the blueprint are designed to improve teaching and learning for all students, including special education students while ending the practice of social promotion. Initial test score data indicates student performance is improving but much work remains to be done to successfully implement this program districtwide. For local reform efforts like the blueprint to continue to succeed, the reauthorization of the Elementary and Secondary Education Act and IDEA must make changes consistent with local reforms and provide the necessary funding to support change. The San Diego Unified School District currently serves over 142,000 students in over 184 schools. Of those, over 15,000 students have active IEPs and receive special education services; 92 percent of the special education current budget provides direct instruction and support for students with special education services. The following addresses some of our current issues regarding special education, IDEA, and funding as well as our recommendations for possible solutions. Nationally, we have witnessed an alarming increase in the number of students with autism. Families are bombarded with the latest and new forms of treatment for autism. All who view and read this information in the media make assumptions that all such services are research based and conform to best practice. There are a variety of instructional strategies and methodologies that are available. As educators, we realize that using only one instructional strategy for all students is not appropriate. More emphasis must be placed in the area of research in the educational approaches which will promote student achievement based on the student's ability and independence. School districts are currently finding the need to retrain teachers in strategies and techniques used with students with autism. We would recommend the development of special grants for the purpose of ongoing professional development for the training of certificated and classified staff in the field. Today, multiple agencies are funded by Federal dollars for providing services to students with special needs. Each of these agencies are under different rules and differentsystems. Although these agencies have a common purpose to provide services for students, these systems become a barrier. At times, although with good intentions, Federal laws will frequently promote a system of disconnect. Although Congress placed limitations on the recovery of attorneys' fees in the 1997 IDEA reauthorization, little has been done to reduce the significant roles such fees continue to play in the decisions that school districts and even parents make regarding educational programs for children with disabilities. An early independent review without all the formal requirements of a due process proceeding may temper each side's expectations and lead to a quicker and fairer resolution. I suggest mandating school districts to participate in alternate dispute resolution and all due process proceedings and reduce reimbursement of attorneys fees proportionately for parents who refuse to participate. Today, significant amounts of program monies are spent on independent educational evaluations. These evaluations are conducted at the request of parents when they disagree with the result of the school district evaluation. Under IDEA and its regulations, the school district must initiate due process proceedings and its associated costs to avoid paying for an independent evaluation. School districts have little economic incentive to request due process in challenging independent educational evaluations when such an action would prove costlier than paying for the evaluation. In my experience, special education has resulted in a system driven more by the need to comply with numerous requirements of both Federal and State laws and regulations than by the genuine educational needs of children with disabilities. The California Department of Education has developed a process of sanctioning school districts who do not meet the zero tolerance level of compliance with timelines for review of annual IEPs or three year reevaluations. This system does not provide for reporting extenuating circumstances that prevent us from meeting timelines. While our district has made great strides in electronic capture of information regarding the status of students receiving special education, 100 percent compliance is difficult to achieve. Requests for data collection and reports by various agencies at the national, State and local levels impose a strain on the district's ability to provide information in a timely manner. Our recommendations are as follows. Data collection should be allowed to report the extenuating circumstances that prevent timelines from being met. Definitions regarding placement settings, disability categories, designated and related services should be consistent across agencies. Data repositories should be developed that can be access by any interested agency from a central location. Thresholds of compliance should reflect the percentage of students reported. Special education reform cannot be done in isolation. While increased IDEA funding may reduce encroachment from the district's general fund, it is necessary to support local reform through augmenting other programs in the education budget. It is essential to support successful districtwide reform efforts that narrow the achievement gap while focusing on enhancing the education for all students. On behalf of the San Diego Unified School District, we appreciate the opportunity to comment on these issues and would offer any assistance. [The information follows:] [GRAPHIC(S) NOT AVAILABLE IN TIFF FORMAT] Mr. Regula. Do you think these regulations should be implemented by the Department of Education rather than a statutory requirement in the law? Ms. Nunes. Yes. Mr. Regula. Questions? Thank you very much. It is a very important program to a lot of parents and to their children. Hopefully, we can meet the challenge of funding. Mr. Cunningham. Thanks, sis. Mr. Regula. Next Ms. Northrup will introduce Dr. Stevan Kukic, a Member of the Board of Directors, National Center for Learning Disabilities. I might say Ms. Northrup is a valued member of this committee and very involved in education matters in the City of Louisville, Kentucky, and brings a broad range of experience as we deal with the difficult education issues. Ms. Northrup. Ms. Northrup. Thank you. It is my pleasure to introduce today Stevan Kukic of the National Center for Learning Disabilities. Dr. Kukic is currently the Vice President of Professional Services, Soppers West Education Services in Longmont, Colorado, a former Director of At Risk and Special Services for the Utah State Office of Education for 11 years. His office provided supervision for all special education services delivered tostudents with disabilities. Dr. Kukic has also provided leadership for services for students at risk, Title I, migrant education correction, youth in custody, homeless, drug and alcohol and vocational special needs. In addition, he has served on many national advisory and editorial boards and is Past President of the National Associations of State Directors of Special Education. Finally, he has been a member of the National Center for Learning Disabilities' Board of Directors since 1996 and on the NCLD's Professional Advisory Board since 1992. Dr. Kukic will talk about the subject that is especially important to me and to us all, how do we help young children develop the skills they need to have to be ready to read. Dr. Kukic. ---------- Wednesday, March 21, 2001. TESTIMONY OF PUBLIC WITNESSES 2002 BUDGET WITNESS DR. STEVAN KUKIC, MEMBER, BOARD OF DIRECTORS NATIONAL CENTER FOR LEARNING DISABILITIES Dr. Kukic. Thank you. It is my pleasure to be with you this morning. Thank you, Ms. Northrup, for that great introduction. All of us are keenly aware if we could get to problems early, we save money and we solve problems in more profound ways. The National Center for Learning Disabilities has dedicated itself through its mission to make certain that we do intervene as early as we possibly can with research based practice and that we do that so people with learning disabilities can achieve their fullest potential. That is our mission. With that in mind, we are pleased to introduce to you this possibility that you would endorse our Get Ready to Read Initiative that we have begun. This initiative is a national screening program to be used by parents of young children as well as early childhood professionals who want to promote early reading and school success. The initiative seeks to ensure that these people have research based, easy to use tools to be able to get a better handle on the kinds of problems young children have that could cause them later difficulties in reading in school. We believe at NCLD if we can accomplish the task of this initiative, we will give people the ability to be able to assess what children are experiencing in their young lives, to recognize those behaviors that will link to resources that will be able to help those children and the people who deal with them to be able to have those kids be successful. It is interesting that even with all the work we are doing in this era of standards based reform, still 30 to 40 percent of our Nation's fourth graders still do not know how to read. There is a wide variety of testing measures that are being used to try to deal with this. What is wonderful is that through the good work that has been done by the National Institutes of Health and especially the National Institute for Child Health and Human Development, we have begun to uncover what the precursors are to success in reading and school. That research has told us that there is a high correlation between the quality of early language and literacy interactions and the acquisition of linguistic skills necessary for reading. That is a very profound piece of research that should be affecting what everyone does in relationship to children, and is beginning to. It is an interesting note; parents who have children with special needs often they wait to get services. There was a recent study that suggests that 40 percent of parents wait a year or longer before they get some help. If you think of what you know about young children, waiting a year or longer is a real dilemma. Seventy-five percent of children who are not identified as having problems and having intervention by the age of nine will continue not to be able to read when they leave high school. So there is a need for research based screening and assessment and a number of complementary efforts have helped to produce the prelude to this initiative. Congress has supported a number of ongoing literacy programs to help improve the ability of children and adults in relationship to this issue. The national education goal of having all preschool kids ready to enter school and ready to learn has also been of value. It sets the stage for what we are trying to do in this Get Ready to Read Initiative. Early last year with leadership from Representative Ann Northrup and Senator Thad Cochran and NICHD, we recruited a team of experts to develop this screening tool. The tool was developed under the leadership of Grover Whitehurst and Christopher Lonigan who worked closely with NCLD staff and advisors and a 20 item screening tool was developed. It was developed using a great process of validation wherein a set of items were correlated with a well accepted goal standard assessment tool so that parents and early childhood professionals can have a screening tool they can trust. In addition, we have identified a set of resources and a set of materials these folks can use after they have done the screening so they can link not only to those resources andmaterials but to other professionals for appropriate diagnosis. The tool itself focuses on four building blocks of literacy: linguistic awareness, letter knowledge, book knowledge and emergent writing. These are all reliable predictors of early reading success. It is our goal to disseminate this tool through national partnerships. The target audience is parents, teachers, child care providers, early childhood providers and other professionals. It is our goal to saturate the field in one year and to embed the tool in the operations of early childhood service organizations. It is a tool to be used with four year olds. We have private sector partnerships, a major multimedia educational publisher that has agreed to disseminate this tool to hundreds of thousands of people. With your support, we will be able to get the initiative going and be able to do a statewide demonstration in nine States including Arizona, California, Kentucky, Maine, Maryland, Mississippi, New Jersey, New York and Washington. Mr. Regula. How do you get it to young parents that need to know. Dr. Kukic. This is going to be a paper tool as well as a web-based tool. We have a partnership with the multimedia international publisher that is helping us be able to get to several million people on the web is what they are able to get to, so we hope that will work out. I will close by saying if we work together in the private sector, in the nonprofit sector and with your support, we will be able to achieve this great goal to be sure no child is left behind. I thank you for this opportunity to speak with you. [The information follows:] [GRAPHIC(S) NOT AVAILABLE Questions? Ms. Northup. Ms. Northup. I would like to thank Dr. Kukic for being here and for the effort. There has been an amazing amount of effort to develop a tool. All the research has now told us that children can be identified as early as four or five years old as being at high risk for needing intervention to learn to read; that if they get effective intervention, we should have single digit percentages of children that don't read and read to their capacity at fourth grade. Is that correct? What you have done is actually developed the test that parents or schools could use. Dr. Kukic. That is exactly correct. This research is not equivocal, it is not a possible. I would go so far as to say it is fact, we know how to teach kids how to read, we know how to identify kids who are at risk of failure at an early age and it is a moral imperative that we do so. Ms. Northup. I would like to compare that with what is actually going on. In my district, an urban district that has a significant population of at risk based on poverty levels and so forth, at risk children that our public schools do not screen children, that a child has to be estimated by a teacher to be one year behind before they are even able to request a test. This is usually sometime in second grade. There is usually a full year's wait before your child is actually tested because of the waiting list and so it is often fourth grade before a child gets in to special education. NIH tells us that at that level, it takes an enormous amount of resources in order to catch up a child who has missed those years of learning to decode and slowly become more accurate and quick so they can get to the understanding age. Part of that is because of the enormous cost for every child discovered. With this tool, you could just screen every child and get to the remediation before they ever--they are not necessarily learning disabled, they just need intervention. Mr. Regula. Mr. Cunningham. Mr. Cunningham. Thank you. If you do that in California and San Diego, I will put it in my newsletter for you so we can put it out there to help disseminate it. I helped rewrite the IDEA bill, so I am very familiar with it, when I was on the Education Committee and authorization. One of the problems we had was parent expectations and the wrong person reaches out and a parent has a child with special needs. They want the absolute best for that child like I want for mine but many times, either a medical doctor not trained to give that diagnosis on how muchper hour or how much per week in training they receive, that parent's expectations are raised to a significant level that is unrealistic and what happens is the school is expected to poll that judgment. Then there is a conflict between the school and the parent. In your program, do you have anything that identifies say a student with dyslexia that may have a higher problem of reading than say a child without that ailment, so that parents don't get the wrong idea or at least expectations? Dr. Kukic. What I like about the screening tool that we have developed is that it is to be used with four year olds. It is a functional kind of tool rather than label-based, it is based on those prerequisite skills that all kids need if they are going to be effective readers. So the interventions that work that have been uncovered so far for those children are usually not very expensive at all. It demands a redirection of the kind of early intervention that is done for these kids as four to six year olds. If you do that well, then there is much less need for very expensive interventions later. There is a lot of a lack of knowledge among a lot of fine professionals about this issue and there is a public relations or public awareness that our chairman of the board really believes in very sincerely that people need to understand what this research is saying so we can intervene at an early age in an economical way to be able to become a nation of readers. That is the point. Mr. Cunningham. I would like to read more about the program. Mr. Regula. Thank you. Our next witness will be Dr. Judith Albino, President, California School of Professional Psychology. She will be introduced by our colleague, Mr. Cunningham. Mr. Cunningham. I would tell Dr. Albino that I have a lot tied to her programs. First of all, she has four campuses. One is Los Angeles, I was born there. Another is in San Diego, I am a member of Congress from there. Another is Fresno where I grew up at 3212 Pine Street and the other is Alameda where I sailed out on an aircraft carrier. She is going to be named the President of Alliant International University which is combining with USIU where my wife got her doctorate degree in education. It is my pleasure to introduce Dr. Albino, President, California School of Professional Psychology. The school has four different campuses, as I mentioned. She is going to be named President of a combined school system. USIU and Alliant have over 2,300 students supported by three campuses and a faculty of over 200 specialists. It supports many of the research and community service programs throughout California. I am pleased to introduce Dr. Judith Albino. I would say you will find another supporter of doubling medical research, especially with San Diego with its super computers, its biotech and its teaching universities. Thank you for coming. ---------- Wednesday, March 21, 2001. TESTIMONY OF PUBLIC WITNESSES 2002 BUDGET WITNESS DR. JUDITH E. ALBINO, PRESIDENT, CALIFORNIA SCHOOL OF PROFESSIONAL PSYCHOLOGY Dr. Albino. Thank you. I appreciate the opportunity to be here today. We are looking forward to expanding our programs in Congressman Cunningham's district and we are grateful for his leadership there. I should note that CSPP currently is headquartered in San Francisco in the district of your subcommittee colleague, Congresswoman Nancy Pelosi. I want to begin by thanking the subcommittee for its recent, very generous support of CSPP's Partners for Success Program which works with California school districts to provide teacher education with a special emphasis on the prevention of violence in the classroom. I appreciate the opportunity to testify today on the importance of providing our Nation's schools with elementary and secondary school counselors. I also am testifying in support of programs of the Health and Human Services Administration and the Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration. Last year, the subcommittee provided $30 million to continue funding for the Elementary School Counseling Demonstration Program. Legislative constraints limited this generous funding to elementary schools. Moreover, the $30 million provided can only begin to meet the needs for these services. At a time when our communities are shocked and griefstricken by incidents of violence in our schools, we have an obligation to do all that we can to provide resources to keep our schools and our students safe. School counselors are an integral part of this effort, yet America's schools are in desperate need of qualified school counselors. The current national student to counselor ratio averages 561 students to every school counselor. The maximum recommended ratio is 250 to 1. Yet, not one State in our Nation meets that recommendation. Although the increase is significant, I am recommending that $100 million be allocated to these efforts in fiscal year 2002 and that the program be expanded to secondary schools. The Surgeon General's National Action Agenda on Children's Mental Health released this past January outlines goals for improving services for the 7.5 million children under the age of 18 who need mental health services; 1 in 10 children and adolescents suffer from mental illness severe enough to cause impairment. Yet, in any given year, it is estimated fewer than 1 in 5 of these children actually receives treatment. The long term consequences of untreated childhood disorders are costly in human as well as dollar terms. Many adult Americans also face challenges that could be prevented or mitigated with behavioral and mental health counseling. These include 18 million with depressive disorders, 14 million who abuse alcohol and 13 million who use addictive drugs. In view of this need, I urge your favorable consideration of $3,150,000,000 in support of the programs of the Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration and $6,472,000,000 in support of programs of the Health Resources and Services Administration. In closing, I want to mention that CSPP trains more than half of the clinical psychologists graduated in California each year and about 15 percent of those across our country. More than 25 percent of our students come from ethnic minority backgrounds. As Congressman Cunningham indicated, CSPP students and faculty provide many hours annually of mental health services at nominal or no cost. Most recently this amounted to nearly 2 million annually. In San Diego County where there are 812,000 people with diagnosed mental health or addictive disorders, the planned construction and staffing of our new community mental health counseling center will significantly expand these services, leveraging public support with in-kind contributions in the form of the services of our faculty and doctoral students. Thank you for your time and I appreciate your support. [The information follows:] [GRAPHIC(S) NOT AVAILABLE IN TIFF FORMAT] Mr. Regula. Questions? Mr. Cunningham. One of the issues we have before this committee that affects directly is a hold harmless that follows Title I for underprivileged children. California is a payer of taxes but doesn't receive its fair share and many of the other States while they have lost population, the growth of California schools with minorities--you stated of these children having problems, 75 percent of them are minorities. We are seeking to have the hold harmless rule instated. I worked with Senator Feinstein last year to make sure that happened. That will help the schools to have the dollars possible. Secondly, my adopted son was in a substance abuse program. Dr. Samms in San Diego and they do a very good job with those children, so you have my support on the issue. When you look at Santana High School, Columbine, the drug problems we have in our schools, if we can get to these children early, it will save a lot of problems down the line. I want to thank you for your services. Dr. Albino. Thank you. I appreciate that statement. I think we all know how important it is to have the resources for these children if we are to avoid the kinds of problems we see in the schools you have mentioned and in so many others as well. They don't all make the headlines but these problems are much more prevalent than they should be. Mr. Regula. I think you are saying they are all interrelated. Dr. Albino. They are indeed. Mr. Regula. Thank you. Next, we have Mr. Pat Teberry from Ohio, a member of the Education Committee. You are doing mark up this morning, putting together the bill we are supposed to pay for. He is going to introduce Dr. Thomas Courtice, President, Ohio Wesleyan, where my daughter graduated. Mr. Teberry. Thank you. There is also another connection to Canton in your district. As you may know, Wesleyan has a strong presence in Canton. Of about 1,800 students, about 50 are from Canton and about 800 alumni in the Canton area. I welcome this opportunity to bring to your attention an issue of significance, not only to Ohio Wesleyan, but to the State of Ohio and the Nation. That is the underrepresentation of minority groups in the sciences at the undergraduate and professional levels. Dr. Tom Courtice serves as the President of Ohio Wesleyan University, an independent, undergraduate liberal arts institution, founded 159 years ago in Delaware, Ohio north of Columbus. Ohio Wesleyan is one of the top liberal arts colleges in the Nation. During his seven years as President of Ohio Wesleyan University, Dr. Courtice has served tostrengthen that institution. I am happy to share with you the fact that there are three Ohio Wesleyan alumni who are members of Congress--Congressman Hopson, Congressman Gilmore as well as Congresswoman Joanna Emerson from Missouri. The entire Ohio Wesleyan community is proud to call them their own and looking forward to working with Dr. Courtice and Ohio Wesleyan and thank you and the committee for allowing him to testify today. Mr. Regula. Dr. Courtice. ---------- Wednesday, March 21, 2001. TESTIMONY OF PUBLIC WITNESSES 2002 BUDGET WITNESS DR. THOMAS B. COURTICE, PRESIDENT, OHIO WESLEYAN UNIVERSITY Dr. Courtice. Thank you. Thank you for this opportunity to provide testimony to you and the members of the subcommittee. Ohio Wesleyan's undergraduate students represent 40 States and 54 countries bringing what is a rich diversity to our campus and it is this commitment to diversity as well as to an enduring commitment to academic excellence that has enabled us to reach and maintain the ranking as one of the top liberal arts colleges in the United States. I want to address briefly a topic that relates to both the quality of education and diversity and that is the need for increased attention to science education for currently underrepresented or minority groups. Ohio Wesleyan has long been acclaimed for its particular attention to science education. We employ some of the Nation's best science teaching faculty and we have committed considerable resources to improving our science facilities. In fact, we will soon begin new construction to expand and renovate existing science buildings and to bring our labs and classrooms up to a 21st century standard. Our commitment to exposing our students to a strong science curriculum has resulted in a doubling of the enrollments in science and math over the last ten years and a similar increase in the number of students who graduate with a Bachelor of Science Degree. In fact, 25 percent of the class of 1999 graduated with a science major and over 60 percent of that number entered directly graduate or professional schools relating to their majors. Student demand for the sciences obviously affects the resources that a particular university dedicates to its science and math departments, yet the increased commitment to the study of science and technology has also been mandated by the explosive growth of science research and its applications in our society. As this commitment to enhancing the quality of science studies grows, so too must the commitment to supply a well educated, large and diverse work force in these growing fields. Scientific, engineering and technological jobs are among the fastest growing in the workforce to the point that current demand for workers has outstripped supply. Demographic trends also inspire concern about the Nation's ability to meet its future technological work force needs. Historically, white males have made up a large fraction of U.S. scientists and engineers. However, this portion of the population has a percentage of the total work force is projected to decrease significantly in coming years as other population groups, African Americans and Hispanics are expected to make up to close to 50 percent of the U.S. work force quite soon. Unfortunately, due to a lack of financial resources, sufficient high school preparation and practicing mentors and role models, minorities are currently severely underrepresented in the science and technology fields. Ohio Wesleyan understands that a more diverse science work force means a broader science agenda bringing different perspectives to bear and producing a deeper analysis of alternatives. As we begin to enhance our own program to encourage greater minority participation in the sciences, I would ask that the Subcommittee consider funding and support for policies and programs which also constructively address similar issues. Such programs may incorporate strategies to provide students with more minority role models and mentors from both public and private sectors. According to the information gathered a few years ago by the National Center for Education, statistics on African Americans, Hispanics and Native Americans teaching in the sciences make up only 1.1 percent of all full-time college faculty. Creative initiatives could help colleges like Ohio Wesleyan broaden the base of minority faculty members and mentors in the sciences. Such programs may also incorporate more science research and other intimate learning opportunities for minority students and they may provide engaging residential sciences programs to pre- college populations. Our Nation's well being has long depended on our ability to adapt and advance with scientific and technical progress. The Federal Government should continue to spend considerable time and effort examining what actions will ensure the Nation has an adequately trained science work force in the future while using liberal arts colleges like Ohio Wesleyan as partners. We anticipate deepening our role in this effort. We look forward to sharing our experience with peer institutions across the country and with public policymakers as we discover what really works when it comes to systematically enhancing and expanding science education and career opportunities to an increasingly diverse population. Thank you for providing us the opportunity to testify before the subcommittee this morning. [The information follows:] [GRAPHIC(S) NOT AVAILABLE IN TIFF FORMAT] Mr. Regula. Do you find the students you are getting have an adequate background coming out of high schools to meet your science curriculum and I am sure you have a placement office and do you find it easy to place these students in good jobs once they complete their studies? Dr. Courtice. I think we have found they have been well prepared, particularly if they declare science as a field of study. It is just that we can't get enough to come across that threshold and declare. Placement opportunities are simply overwhelming and with a solid science background, the options for young people today are quite wide and expansive, whether graduate professional study or entering the work force immediately. Mr. Regula. Thank you. There certainly is a lot of interest in science but a precursor to that is you have to be able to read. That puts literacy right at the front end of all this. Dr. Courtice. That is why we think those pre-college programs are very important. Mr. Regula. Do you offer remedial for students coming in? Dr. Courtice. We do have remedial work in both quantitative and writing skills. We have also tried to introduce some of that work prior to the time students actually enroll on campus so they are doing that in their junior and senior years in high school. Mr. Regula. Thank you. Our next witness will be Warrick Carter, President, Columbia College, Chicago, to be introduced by our colleague, Mr. Jackson. Mr. Jackson. Thank you. Since early last year, Dr. Warrick Carter has served as President of Columbia College in my hometown of Chicago. Columbia is a private, four-year, liberal arts college specializing in the visual arts, performing arts and communications. Columbia's philosophy of hands-on, minds-on education plus their location in one of the world's most vibrant cities adds to a depth and richness of experience for all who enter its doors. From 1996 to last year, Dr. Carter served as Director of Entertainment Arts at Walt Disney Entertainment in Lake Buena Vista, Florida and from 1984 to 1996, he served as Provost, Vice President of Academic Affairs and Dean of Faculty at Berkley College of Music, Boston, Massachusetts. Dr. Carter received his Bachelors Degree in Music Education at Tennessee State University, his Masters and Doctorate in Music Education at Michigan State University. I present Dr. Warrick Carter, President of Columbia College. Mr. Regula. A couple of questions. Do you get a lot of your students from college? Mr. Carter. Yes, about three-quarters of our students come from the State of Illinois. Mr. Regula. Yesterday, thanks to Mr. Jackson, we had the Superintendent or CEO of the Chicago School system, very impressive. My question to you is are you seeing this as a result of their efforts in the public school system and the level of achievement of the students you are getting? Mr. Carter. Yes, we are. In fact, we work hand and glove with Chicago Public Schools. We offer a variety of programs that serve to train teachers specifically in science. We have an innovative approach to teaching science through the arts and we are training teachers to do so. We have received some rather outstanding accolades because of it. It has changed the whole quality of science instruction in the public schools. Mr. Regula. Thanks to Mr. Jackson, I will be meeting with the CEO this evening. I was impressed with what is being done and certainly Mr. Jackson has related a lot of this to me. So you are telling me the system is working? Mr. Carter. The system is working, working much better than it worked before. Mr. Regula. Thank you. ---------- Wednesday, March 21, 2001 TESTIMONY OF PUBLIC WITNESSES 2002 BUDGET WITNESS WARRICK CARTER, PRESIDENT, COLUMBIA COLLEGE Mr. Carter. Thank you for that introduction and your time. You have a lot of friends at Columbia College and we look forward to seeing you soon. I am Warrick L. Carter, President of Columbia College. Thank you for this opportunity to speak to you. As Congressman Jackson said, Columbia College is a private, nonprofit, undergraduate and graduate institution in Chicago's South Loop neighborhood that offers educational programs and arts in the communications disciplines within a context of liberal arts. With a fall enrollment of over 9,000 students, we are the fifth largest private institution in the State of Illinois. I am here to speak about the many needs of institutions of higher education, particularly those of urban colleges and universities like Columbia College and how Federal programs can help address some of these needs. Columbia College is one of the very few open arts administration institutions in the United States and has the largest minority enrollment of any institution of its kind in the country. We enroll students from across the country, across the world but it is primarily an Illinois and Chicago institution. More than three-quarters of Columbia College students are from the State of Illinois and the majority of these are from Chicago and the Chicago metropolitan area. A third of the college's students are African Americans, Latino or Asian Americans and a large number of all of our students are first in their family to attend college. Delivering excellent higher education with open admission in a very diverse urban setting is exhilarating but full of challenges. City kids, minority kids, first generation college kids are much more likely than their peers to drop out before they complete college. The loss of these kids, to their families, to Chicago and to the country is staggering. Helping students to stay in college and complete their degree at Columbia is our most important challenge. The U.S. Department of Education funds a number of programs that are of critical importance to retention at Columbia College, Chicago and to urban colleges and universities in general. The Pell Grant Program is first and foremost amongst these. At Columbia, nearly one-third of our undergraduate students receive Pell grants and are eligible to participate in the matching grant programs supplied by the State of Illinois. Although these grants do not cover the full cost of tuition and fees, without them, many of these students could not attend college at all. Title III and the Fund for the Improvement of Post Secondary Education are also vital to this effort. Currently at Columbia, Title III funds a multifaceted, academic and social support program for lower income, first generation and minority students. These funds support a comprehensive, all college effort to enhance and improve the first year experience of all new students. Research shows from around the country that the first year, even the first semester, and sometimes the first week of a student's experience in college will determine the likelihood that they will stay in college and ultimately graduate. In 1999, the college adopted a comprehensive retention program that focused on new freshmen which holistically addresses the interwoven factors that affect students' success. We received a $500,000 grant from the Department to support this initiative. In just one year, the percentage of freshmen returning to their sophomore year climbed by five percent. This past fall, 90 percent of all at risk students who participated in a summer program we refer to as our summer bridge program returned for a second semester. Columbia is now hoping to undertake an ambitious mentoring program for our minority students. Under the program, all new entering minority students will be paired with a faculty member or staff mentor to help students determine his or her own educational goals, negotiate the new and unfamiliar college experience, and to utilize student services, and hopefully develop this ongoing bond that is soimportant to be connected to an institution and to stay until completion. As mentoring has proven to be a very effective retention tool, this program will reinforce new students' decisions to attend college and quickly integrate these minority students into the academic, artistic and social fiber of the college. A sense of community is vital to retention and to providing a rich educational environment as well. Campuses such as Columbia are diffused and less contained than traditional college campuses. Fewer students live on campus and many commute daily throughout the metropolitan area. Although our dozen plus buildings are interspersed with residential, retail, commercial make us a major landowner within the area, we have only what can be defined as a loosely defined campus. The college hopes to counteract this with a new Student and Art Center that will create a focal point for our campus and for diverse community groups in the South Loop that we serve, private, nonprofit. We have the largest program of film studies in the country with 1,700 students, one of the largest programs in television and radio and recording technology. Our alums have gone on to rather well heights and others stay in the area. We have alums in California who are Academy Award winners, one for saving Private Ryan and Schindler's List, so we are proud of the quality of what we do in film and television. Mr. Regula. It is a growing industry. Mr. Carter. We found in Chicago a lot of independent films are moving away from Los Angeles because it is more cost effective to do films outside, so we see the industry growing in Chicago. There was over $150 million spent in Chicago last year in films and television shows. In Orlando, where I spent time recently, we did some $500 million worth of films. Compare that with what is going on in California, slowly but surely people are looking to do films outside of California. We think our alums are partly leading that charge. We have two who have chosen to return to Chicago and do their films there. The very recent film, Men of Honor, was done there and prior to that Soul Food, also the television program. Each case, they chose to return to their hometown and therefore create employment for our alums as well as for others in the city. Mr. Regula. That is a great impact. Do you interact with the National Endowment for the Arts? Mr. Jackson. Yes, we do. We have been fortunate to receive both NEA and NEH funding. Mr. Regula. Do you think they do a good job? Mr. Jackson. Yes. If that funding were a bit larger, I think they would do a much better job. Mr. Regula. I knew that was coming. [Laughter.] Thank you.

TESTIMONY OF PUBLIC WITNESSES 2002 BUDGET WITNESS MARILYN HELD, DIRECTOR, LABORATORY SUPPORT SERVICES, ST. JOHN HEALTH SYSTEM, DETROIT Next is Ms. Kilpatrick from the great State of Michigan where they have a better football team than Ohio State, but times will change, is going to introduce Marilyn held, Director of Laboratory Support Services, St. John Health System, Detroit. Ms. Kilpatrick. Thank you for allowing us to present our constituents and for you to take the time to consider them. We appreciate it. I would like to present to you Ms. Marilyn Held, Director of Laboratory Support Services at St. John Health Systems in Detroit; a prominent member of the American Society of Clinical Pathologists; and has served as a board member on that society, has served on the Finance and Planning Committee and has been awarded the Distinguished Service Award from the Society in 1999. Ms. Held received her Bachelor's Degree at the University of South Dakota, performed her medical technology internship at the University of Iowa and completed her graduate education in Microbiology at the University of Arizona. I am happy to present Ms. Held. I have three 10 o'clock assignments this morning, Transportation being next door. I am happy to be with you this morning and Foreign Operations in a totally other building. Please excuse me if I am not able to stay with you. Mr. Regula. I have some interest in a few projects in Transportation so we will be very nice to you. Ms. Kilpatrick. Thank you. Ms. Hill. Ms. Held. Thank you for your support of the laboratory community and back home in Michigan. We appreciate it. Ms. Kilpatrick. Thank you. Ms. Held. Thank you for inviting me to represent the American Society of Clinical Pathologists. The ASCP has 75,000 members and is the world's largest organization representing pathologists and laboratory personnel. I am here to inform you today that the United States is facing a very serious shortage of medical laboratory personnel. Vacancy rates for 7 of 10 key laboratory medicine positions is at an all time high. ASCP in conjunction with an independent polling firm conducts a biannual wage and vacancy survey of 2,500 medical laboratory managers. The data for 2000 was published this month and I would like to give you a glimpse of what we found. Vacancy rates for cytotechnologists, the professionals who perform pap smears, in the northeast, the vacancy rate was 45 percent, 16.7 percent for the east north central and 33.3 percent for the far west, rural areas average a 20 percent vacancy rate and large cities a rather surprising 28.3 vacancy rate. Histotechnologists, the individuals who prepare tissue specimens, have an average vacancy rate of over 20 percent, the west, south central region of the country has a 73.7 percent vacancy rate; the south central Atlantic States have an average vacancy rate of 16.7 percent. By comparison, the vacancy rate for medical technologists will not appear to be of concern but it is. Medical technology vacancy rates average 11.1 percent but rural areas are at 21.1 percent. Rather than continue to quote statistics, I would like to put a face on these numbers. It is estimated that 70 percent of diagnostic and treatment decisions for patients are based on laboratory tests. In my own institution, our laboratory will perform over 10 million diagnostic tests next year alone. Tests such as measuring cardiac enzymes for heart attacks, performing prostate biopsies, hemoglobin electrophoresis for the diagnosis of sickle disease and trait and measurements for high calcium levels in blood and urine to assess future risk for osteoporosis are only a few examples. In my hospital, we have as of yesterday, a 12.4 percent vacancy rate of those personnel that assess cardiac enzymes and osteoporosis related tests and a 19 percent vacancy rate for people who prepare prostate and breast tissue for biopsies. One of the logical solutions to this vacancy rate problem is to train more students. However, the number of programs are decreasing. In my home State, we have seen the number of programs plummet from 27 to 8 in less than two decades. Nationwide, the number of graduates in medical technology has decreased 30 percent in the five years. The continued demand for laboratory services is real and is expected to grow. Given the country's aging population, the number and complexity of biopsy specimens, tests and the use of molecular techniques will increase in the next decade. Laboratory professionals who entered the work force in the 1960s and the 1970s will be retiring soon. Also, the threat of bioterrorism and emerging infectious diseases calls for trained laboratory professionals to respond. There are solutions to these problems. There are allied health grants available to attract laboratory professionals to the field especially minorities and individuals in rural and under served communities. For example, the University of Nebraska Medical Center established medical technology education sites in rural Nebraska under an Allied Health Project Grant. As of 1999, of 69 graduates, 99 percent took their first job in a rural community and 74 percent took their first job in rural Nebraska. The grants are also designed to create successful minority recruiting and retention programs for medical technologists. As a direct result of this Federal support, the University of Maryland, Baltimore, as of the fall 2000, reached a 64 percent minority student enrollment at a majority institution, one of the highest in the country. Most Allied Health Grant projects continue after Federal funding ends, making them a long lasting worthwhile investment in the future of allied health. The Allied Health Project Grants Program is a relatively small step in assuring that funding is available to attract individuals to the allied health professions. It needs to be seriously considered. Thank you for your time. We are requesting $21 million. [The information follows:] [GRAPHIC(S) NOT AVAILABLE IN TIFF FORMAT] Mr. Regula. Why do you think there aren't more young people, certainly the opportunities are enormous? Why don't young people elect this field? Ms. Held. We have looked at that a lot and the field requires a good background in math and science. We are finding that with the opportunities in computers, the .coms, the biotech corporations that there are many opportunities now that people just aren't going into health care as frequently. Mr. Regula. Do you get information out to high schools so that young people can think about this as a career? Ms. Held. Yes. The American Society of Clinical Pathologists has partnered with organizations like the National Biology Teachers Association and we do work with recruitment in those sort of forums. Independently, my organization like other hospitals, goes to high schools, middle schools, elementary schools whenever we are given the opportunity. Mr. Regula. Is St. John a free-standing organization that provides services to a number of hospitals? Ms. Held. Yes. St. John Health System is a seven hospital, integrated delivery network and three of our hospitals are in Detroit and four in the neighboring suburbs and out in the rural areas as well. Mr. Regula. So it is a consortium that all seven can use? Ms. Held. Right. Mr. Regula. Thank you for coming. ---------- Wednesday, March 21, 2001. TESTIMONY OF PUBLIC WITNESSES 2002 BUDGET WITNESS DEBORAH A. CHAMBERS, PRESIDENT-ELECT & MEMBER OF THE BOARD OF DIRECTORS, AMERICAN ASSOCIATION OF NURSE ANESTHETISTS Next is Deborah Chambers, President-elect and Member of the Board of Directors, American Association of Nurse Anesthetists. Welcome. Ms. Chambers. My name is Deborah Chambers. As President- elect of the American Association of Nurse Anesthetists, I represent 29,000 certified registered nurse anesthetists across the country, also known as CRNAs. We deliver safe anesthesia care to patients in every State, every day. I will summarize four points: what do CRNAs do and where, the nursing shortage and the CRNA shortage, our appropriations request and one regulatory issue of interest to Congress. America's 29,000 CRNAs provide two-thirds of all the anesthetics in the United States. We are the sole anesthesia provider in over 70 percent of rural hospitals. We are the predominant anesthesia provider in rural and urban under served areas of communities and to the military. For over 100 years, nurse anesthetists have been providing anesthesia. The Institute of Medicine reports anesthesia is 50 times safer today than it was 20 years ago. We believe this is in part due to our advanced training and our continuing education and recertification requirements that are by far the most rigorous in the field of anesthesia care. Yet, as more Americans become eligible for Medicare, there are fewer nurses and CRNAs to care for them. It is in America's interest to work together so that nurses and CRNAs are available for patients who need care. The nursing shortage is here today. Student nurse anesthetists must have practiced as a nurse for at least two or more years so we are deeply concerned that the number of registered nurses under the age of 35 has fallen by more than 50 percent over the last 20 years to a level less than 20 percent of all registered nurses in the country. Our 82 accredited nursing anesthesia programs are full but they are graduating about 700 fewer nurse anesthetists per year than what HHS says is required to meet the demand. The demand is growing and creating a CRNA shortage in the marketplace. In 1999, the State of North Carolina reported 82 CRNA position vacancies and it is projected these vacancies will extend to beyond 133 by the year 2004. Today, the number of classified ads advertising and recruiting for nurse anesthetists published in our national journals is growing month by month. What should we do? We should work together to educate more CRNAs. With such shortage helping to support the education of nurse anesthetists is much more cost effective for taxpayers than subsidizing other types of anesthesia providers. The committee has shown real leadership and we are asking for that leadership to continue. We commend the committee for providing significant increases for nursing education programs in fiscal year 2001, especially for the advanced education nursing program within HHS's Bureau of Health Professions. For fiscal year 2002, we recommend an increase of $11 million for advanced education nursing to at least $70 million. We note that the President's fiscal year 2002 blueprint identifies this type of program to help alleviate the nursing shortage. We recommend an increase of at least $10 million to the Nursing Education Loan Repayment Program. We urge an increase in the National Institute for Nursing Research budget up to $125 million. We also recommend that the committee consider funding specific initiatives to help expand existing CRNA schools, establish new schools and to recruit and retain faculty for the training of nurse anesthetists. While America's existing nursing anesthesia schools are full, expanding these schools or establishing new ones without Federal funding as a catalyst has proven to be very difficult. We look forward to working with the members of the committee on this project. We recommend the committee permit Medicare's new anesthesia care rule to take effect. Published on January 18, 2001, this important Medicare rule lets States decide the issue of physician supervision for nurse anesthetists. This rule gives States and hospitals the flexibility they need to provide superior health care to patients. It is supported by hospitals, nursing organizations and the National Rural Health Association, many members of the House and Senate and many members of this panel on both sides of the aisle. Secretary Thompson has signed an order to have the rule take effect on May 18, 2001. This should be a matter for the States which govern health professional scope of practice. This concludes my remarks. I welcome your questions. [The information follows:] [GRAPHIC(S) NOT AVAILABLE IN TIFF FORMAT] Mr. Regula. Is this group licensed by medical boards in each of the States? Ms. Chambers. Your licensed as a registered nurse through the State and you are certified by the National Association. Mr. Regula. So you get your nursing license from the State and certification is national? Ms. Chambers. Yes, sir. Mr. Regula. Can you move from State to State? Ms. Chambers. As long as you have license as a registered nurse from that State. The certification is the national certification so you can move. Mr. Regula. Do some States require a doctor be present and others not? I have heard that is an issue. Ms. Chambers. The whole can of worms is that nurse anesthetists practice along with physicians. Obviously in the surgical arena, a nurse anesthetist is present to provide anesthesia for a patient undergoing a surgical procedure. The difference comes in that States rules and regs differ from State to State so there are actually 29 States that do not require supervision of a nurse anesthetist. What we are asking is to let the States decide. Mr. Regula. Thank you. Mr. Jackson. Mr. Jackson. No questions. Mr. Regula. Thank you for coming. Next, Mr. Jackson will introduce Miguelina Leon, Director, Government Relations and Public Policy, National Minority AIDS Council. Mr. Jackson. Since 1994, Miguelina Ileana Leon has served as the Director of Government Relations and Public Policy for the National Minority AIDS Council. She is a certified social worker with a Masters from Columbia University and she has worked in HIV AIDS services in advocacy since 1985. Established in 1987, NMAC is the leading national membership organization addressing the HIV AIDS epidemic among communities of color. With a membership of over 600 organizations and 3,000 affiliates, NMAC provides training, technical assistance and policy analysis for community-based organizations on the front lines of the HIV AIDS epidemic. NMAC's most recent advocacy work focuses on the elimination of ethnic and racial health disparities with a special focus on the disproportionate HIV AIDS incidence and death rates among ethnic minorities. NMAC has worked with the Congressional Black Caucus to address the state of emergency of HIV AIDS in the African American community, helping to secure $156 million in Federal funding for highly impacted communities of color in 1998, $250 million in 1999 and $350 million last year. Mr. Chairman and members of the subcommittee, I present Ms. Miguelina Ileana Leon. Wednesday, March 21, 2001. TESTIMONY OF PUBLIC WITNESSES 2002 BUDGET WITNESS MIGUELINA LLEANA LEON, DIRECTOR, GOVERNMENT RELATIONS AND PUBLIC POLICY NATIONAL MINORITY AIDS COUNCIL Ms. Leon. Thank you, Congressman Jackson, for that very comprehensive presentation. My name is Miguelina Ileana Leon. I am testifying today on behalf of the National Minority AIDS Council. I would like to thank the members of the subcommittee for your extraordinary leadership and commitment to HIV AIDS prevention and care programs, biomedical and behavioral research and other crucial health programs. NMAC commends the leadership and the foresight of the Congressional Black Caucus and the Congressional Hispanic Caucus in crafting and expanding the minority aids initiative to assure a targeted response to the growing HIV AIDS health disparities among communities of color. Our work as health advocates and HIV service providers has been strengthened by your combined efforts and generous support. Our Nation has made remarkable progress in combating HIV AIDS in the last decade, however, the dynamic nature and evolving epidemic represents complex challenges and requires intensified efforts to respond. The disproportionate impact of HIV on communities of color is not a new phenomena, yet the trends over the last decade clearly reflect a growing burden of morbidity and mortality among ethnic and racial minorities. Consider these facts, people of color make up 56 percent of the cumulative AIDS cases and 68 percent of the new AIDS cases report by the Centers for Disease Control through June 2000. Men of color accounted for 63 percent of the new AIDS cases and women of color accounted for 82 percent of the new AIDS cases among females. Similarly, children of color represented 84 percent of the pediatric AIDS cases. Most recently, young men of color and women of color have become highly vulnerable. Just a few weeks ago, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention released a survey of young men which looked at over 2,000 gay and bisexual young men in Los Angeles, Miami, New York and Seattle. This survey showed that the highest infection rates were among African Americans, 30 percent, and Latinos, 15 percent. The CBC Minority AIDS Initiative was developed in 1999 to target funds to eliminate the persistent HIV AIDS related health disparities among ethnic and racial minorities. The CBC Initiative continues to be needed now more than ever. The initiative is intended to expand the infrastructure and capacity in minority community-based organizations to provide quality HIV prevention interventions and medical and supportive services. By building infrastructure and increasing the capacity of these organizations, the initiative enables the organizations to access needed funding to build their own programs in their own communities. The CBC Initiative is not intended to create a parallel system of programs or services. It does put in place HIV AIDS services in communities that have been historically underserved and also complements existing HIV prevention and health care services. These resources are intended to provide a bridge that will enable minority community-based organizations to ultimately broader Federal HIV AIDS funding. The CBC Minority Initiative cannot stand alone and we know it must work in conjunction with other HIV AIDS programs. However, we believe it is necessary to expand this initiative to a level of $540 million in fiscal year 2002 in order to support and expand the infrastructure of minority community- based organizations and to ensure that we address the health disparities by enabling these organizations to provide culturally competent services within their own communities. We believe it is important to commit to this effort, to sustain these efforts and we strongly recommend the Subcommittee sustain, safeguard and expand the CBC Minority AIDS Initiative by providing the additional funding in fiscal year 2002. Thank you for your attention and consideration of these issues. [The information follows:] [GRAPHIC(S) NOT AVAILABLE IN TIFF FORMAT] Mr. Regula. Do you work in the area of prevention as well as curative approaches? Ms. Leon. Yes. Actually, we are a national organization and we provide training and technical assistance and support to organizations on the front line of the epidemic. They actually are working in prevention and supportive services, and also providing health services. Mr. Regula. Is there some growing success in treatment? Ms. Leon. There definitely have been great advances in treatment over the last ten years. However, what we see in relationship to ethnic and racial minorities is that they don't experience the same benefits in terms of health outcomes for a variety of reasons, including they have less access to quality health services, greater numbers of uninsured people and there is a large proportion of ethnic and racial minorities that have been traditionally hard to reach populations such as the homeless, people who have chemical dependency problems and women. Mr. Regula. Other questions? I see we have a vote. I think we can take one more before we have to vote. We will have Mr. Phil Jacobs, President, BellSouth Corporation. ---------- Wednesday, March 21, 2001. TESTIMONY OF PUBLIC WITNESSES 2002 BUDGET WITNESS PHIL JACOBS, PRESIDENT, BELLSOUTH CORPORATION Mr. Jacobs. I am Phil Jacobs, President of Georgia Operations for BellSouth Corporation and also a graduate of Dennison University in Granville, Ohio. Thank you for the opportunity to be here. I am here today on behalf of a group called Friends of CDC to discuss infrastructure funding for the Centers of Disease Control and Prevention construction budget in the 2002 budget. Let me begin by offering my thanks to this subcommittee on behalf of the Friends of CDC for securing the appropriations in this year's budget of $175 million. This was an enormous step forward and a great step forward to begin the construction of new facilities at both of our campuses for the CDC in Atlanta. It is just that, a start. I am here today to respectfully ask this committee to continue to support averting what I believe is a pending crisis waiting to happen in health care. The current infrastructure of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention in Atlanta has dilapidated buildings that are creating a hazardous situation for our world class scientists. This situation must be corrected. It is clear to me if we are going to continue to have the world's leading health organization to be able to address the myriad of health issues that are coming at us today, we need to have first class facilities and need to continue to recruit first class scientists into those facilities. Before I tell you more specifically about the facilities in Atlanta, let me take a minute and talk about the organization, Friends of CDC and how we began. The Friends of CDC is a group of corporate citizens who joined together about two years ago to highlight the need for infrastructure funding for the CDC in Atlanta. This group includes not only my company, BellSouth, but also UPS, Home Depot, Delta Airlines, Cox Communications, the Southern Company, Healtheon Web/MD, Merck, HCA, the Health Care Company, General Electric and Aetna Insurance Company. It is a voluntary, civic-minded group deeply concerned with the facilities situation at the Nation's premiere health institution and we are concerned that this institution's facilities have been allowed to deteriorate to the point they have today. I personally first visited the CDC in Atlanta in 1999 but I never imagined what I would see in terms of the horrific conditions in the buildings there. By the way, I would like to extend to any member of this subcommittee an invitation to join us in Atlanta for a tour of the facilities because I will tell you now that words can't do justice to the lack of and horrific conditions that we are asking our folks to work in. Mr. Regula. The $170 million that was put in last year, will that provide some help? Mr. Jacobs. Some relief, absolutely. As a matter of fact, we just had the opening of a new facility on the Emory University Campus which gave us an additional number of level four laboratories which is where the highest security and most dangerous agents are dealt with. However, there are a host of other facilities that are still housed in inadequate housing that need to be addressed. This $250 million we are asking for this year is part of an overall $1 billion program that will bring us basically to the 21st century. Mr. Regula. Your company is contributing? Mr. Jacobs. Financially contributing? Mr. Regula. Yes? Mr. Jacobs. To the Friends of CDC organization, we are all contributors to that organization. Mr. Regula. So there is local help and support in addition to the Federal money? Mr. Jacobs. The money we are contributing which is a small amount actually goes towards our efforts in creating public awareness around this. There is no contribution to actual construction of the buildings. As you know, the role of the CDC over the past few years has continued to expand, addressing a group of areas, including infectious diseases, HIV and AIDS, tuberculosis and since 1973, the CDC has discovered more than 35 new deadly viruses and bacteria that create human health hazards. In addition to infectious diseases, they also work on preventing chronic diseases such as cardiovascular, cancer and diabetes. Other activities include the maximization of immunization rates for children, preventing a wide range of environmental diseases by preventing exposure to toxic chemicals and protecting employees from workplace injuries and disease. I would not allow any of my employees to operate in that kind of an environment. Quite frankly, if the same Federal and State health and workplace requirements were applied to this facility, it would be shut down. Let me say that the Parasitic Disease Laboratory which is one of the laboratories that has not yet been updated under this plan, are in temporary wooden barracks that were built in the 1940s, with a lifespan expectancy of 15 years. We are now 45 years beyond that life expectancy. We have regular occurrences where, for example, refrigeration units fall through the floor; where power is inadequate and shut down periodically. We even had a incidence recently where we lost samples in a refrigeration unit, because the power system could not adequately supply the building. Mr. Regula. Let me tell you, our committee is going down there in about a week or shortly thereafter and visit the facility. Mr. Jacobs. Right. Mr. Regula. So I am sure we will be given an opportunity to see some of the deficiencies. Mr. Jacobs. Thank you; we look forward to having you down here. Mr. Regula. Do you have much more, sir? Mr. Jacobs. No, I will just close by simply saying that last was an excellent start, with $175 million, and we respectfully request that the $250 million be put in this year's budget. Thank you. [The information follows:] [GRAPHIC(S) NOT AVAILABLE IN TIFF FORMAT] Mr. Regula. Well, we thank you and all the companies that expressed an interest in this. Hopefully, maybe they can make some financial contributions to help get the job done, and we appreciate that. Mr. Jacobs. Thank you. Mr. Regula. The committee will recess. We have a one minute vote, which is in process now, and then three five minute votes. So I would say roughly ten after or a quarter after, we will reconvene, as we can get the votes over with. So if you all will be patient, we will go and do our duty. [Recess.] Mr. Regula. We will reconvene the committee. Mr. Jackson, I think you want to introduce your guest here. Mr. Jackson. Mr. Chairman, Linda Anderson has served as President and Chief Operating Officer for the Sickle Cell Disease Association of America, Incorporated, since 1992. During her eight year tenure, the Pittsburgh native and Carnegie Mellon graduate has used her 24 years of corporate management experience to position SCDAA as a source of services and support for individuals and families affected by sickle cell disease. Ms. Anderson was instrumental in developing and implementing a five year strategic plan, designed to strengthen the infrastructure of the 64 member association, promote the association's national programs, and heighten public awareness. Ms. Anderson is also active on several national boards or committees, including Vice Chair, Executive Committee, Community Health Charities, and the President's Committee on the Employment of People with Disabilities. Mr. Chairman and members of the subcommittee, Ms. Anderson. ---------- Wednesday, March 21, 2001. THE SICKLE CELL DISEASE ASSOCIATION OF AMERICA WITNESSES LYNDA K. ANDERSON, PRESIDENT/COO, SCDAA, THE SICKLE CELL DISEASE ASSOCIATION OF AMERICA TAHIRA YVONNE GIVHAN Ms. Anderson. Thank you very, very much, Congressman Jackson. On behalf of the Sickle Cell Disease Association of America, I want to thank you, Chairman Regula and members of the subcommittee, for giving me this opportunity to testify. With me today, I have Tahira Yvonne Givhan, the 2000/2001 national poster child, our junior ambassador, for the Sickle Cell Disease Association of America. She is our star. Tahira will be speaking with you today on the challenges that she faces in life, because of having sickle cell anemia, an inherited genetic disease. Before Tahira delivers her remarks, I would like to briefly summarize the SCDAA's fiscal year 2002 appropriations request. First, we ask that $4 million be provided to support a two part community outreach demonstration. Specifically, $2 million is requested from the Maternal Child Health Block Grant. Special projects of regional and national significance account to support the strengthening and expansion of locally-based newborn screening follow-up activities; and $2 million is requested from the Office of Minority Health, or another account within the Health Resources Services Administration, to support the strengthening and expansion of locally-based related outreach and supportive service efforts. Second, we support the efforts underway at the National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute, to strengthen data coordination efforts of the ten comprehensive sickle centers, and seek increased resources for the establishment of a clinical research network. We ask that increased funding and report language in support of this effort be included in the fiscal year 2001 Labor HHS Education Appropriation Bill. A more detailed outline of these requests has been submitted for the record. However, now I would like for Tahira to tell you why, in her words, these resources are so desperately needed. Mr. Regula. Well, Tahira, we are happy to welcome you. I can see why you chose her. She is a very pretty young lady. Ms. Givhan. Thank you. Mr. Regula. So we will be pleased to hear your testimony, Tahira. What grade are you in? Ms. Givhan. Fourth. Mr. Regula. Fourth grade, and where do you go to school? Ms. Givhan. Oak Mountain Intermediate School. Mr. Regula. What city is that? Ms. Givhan. Shelby County. Mr. Regula. Well, we are pleased that you could come this morning, so we will look forward to hearing from you. Ms. Givhan. Thank you, Mr. Chairman and other committee members. My name is Tahira Yvonne Givhan. I come to you on behalf of the Sickle Cell Disease Association of America. I have sickle anemia. It is a disease of the red blood cells. I am inherited the gene from both my parents. First and foremost, thank you for providing the funding for new treatment therapies, supportive services, and newborn testing. In fact, the doctor tested me while I was still in the hospital, as a newborn baby. That is the law in most states, and it is a fantastic law, because babies with sickle cell anemia often require special care. As a result of your investment, sickle cell anemia no longer spells doom and gloom, the way it did years ago. The mortality rate for infants with sickle cell anemia has decreased dramatically. Again, I thank you. Yes, the advances made in biomedicine in recent years are appreciated greatly. However, more funding is badly needed to help find a cure, so that we will no longer have to manage the pain and suffering that comes with having this unpredictable disease. Because I have sickle cell anemia, my cells are sickled, making it hard for oxygen to stay in them. Sometimes, these sickle shaped cells become sticky and thick, and can clog small blood vessels in my body. When this happens, I hurt. This can cause a lot of pain anywhere in my body. When my head hurts, my parents and doctors have to monitor me closely, to make sure that I do not have a stroke, like many people with sickle cell anemia. It is true that I enjoy a number of activities like other young people my age: ballet, riding my bike, and playing on the swing set. But during most of the days of the week, I am very tired and in pain. At school, I do not think that my teachers understand how difficult it is for me to keep up with the other kids, particularly in P.E. So in addition to being in great pain, I have to suffer the embarrassment of being different. The challenges faced by families that have children with sickle cell anemia are pretty serious. Therefore, the services provided SCDAA's member organization, such as outreach, are very important; but they need more help so that they can help more kids like me. I believe and have faith that a cure will be found in my lifetime, so that as we move into this new millennium, we, too, can enjoy the American dream in its totality. When this happens, it will just be wonderful. Mr. Regula. Well, Tahira, you are a very persuasive witness. [Laughter.] Mr. Jackson. Mr. Jackson. Mr. Chairman, let me again thank Ms. Anderson and Tahira for their testimony. I do not have sickle cell anemia, but I, like my father, carry the trait, as well. I introduced elevating the Office of Research on Minority Health at NIH to a center status last year, which fortunately passed with the help of Mr. Bilirakis, John Lewis, Benny Thompson, Senator Frist and Senator Kennedy in the Senate. Sickle cell anemia just happens to be one of those diseases at the National Institute of Health that could use better coordination amongst all of the centers. But for the elevation of the office to center level, the office itself did not have the ability to even sit in the room with the other centers, to look across the entire institute, for the purposes of trying to arrive at a cure. If there ever was a disease, Mr. Chairman, that is reflective of the disparities that exist amongst those groups who have been left behind in America, it is certainly sickle cell anemia. Of all of the options and diseases that will be before the Center for Research on Minority Health at NIH, sickle cell anemia should be way on top of the list for Dr. Ruffin, Dr. Fouchey, and Ms. Kirschstein at NIH. I will be arguing on behalf of Tahira and other children, as well as Americans who are similarly situated, for the appropriate amounts at the National Institute of Health, to reflect her desire and our desire to bring an end to this devastating illness. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. Mr. Regula. Thank you. Tahira, do you have to miss much school? Ms. Givhan. No. Mr. Regula. You must not, because you certainly speak very well for a fourth grader. Ms. Givhan. Thank you. Mr. Regula. Thank you for coming. Ms. Anderson. Thank you for having us. Mr. Regula. Our next witness is Dr. John Sever, Member, International PolioPlus Committee, Rotary International. Wednesday, March 21, 2001. INTERNATIONAL POLIOPLUS COMMITTEE, ROTARY INTERNATIONAL WITNESS DR. JOHN L. SEVER, MEMBER, INTERNATIONAL POLIOPLUS COMMITTEE, ROTARY INTERNATIONAL Mr. Sever. Thank you very much, Chairman Regula and Congressman Jackson. It is a pleasure and a privilege to be here to tell you about the International PolioPlus Program to eradicate polio worldwide. I am a professor of pediatrics at the Children's Hospital here in Washington and George Washington University. I am representing Rotary International, which I am a member of. There are 1.1 million members of Rotary International, of which there are about 380,000 members in the United States. Some years ago, the Rotary founded a coalition to eradicate polio worldwide. That includes the March of Dimes Birth Defects Foundation, the American Academy of Pediatrics Task Force for Child Survival and Development, and the U.S. Fund for UNICEF, along with Rotary International. We are working to help eradicate this disease worldwide. The goal is to complete that eradication by the year 2005, which is just a few years ahead. It will be only the second disease in the history of man that has been eradicated; small pox being the other disease. So the goal is not just to control the disease, not just to immunize children, but to eradicate the disease completely worldwide by the year 2005, at which point we will be able to stop immunizing for polio, because it will no longer exist in the world, just as we did stop for smallpox. There has been a great deal of progress made, and the support from this subcommittee, your support, has been very important through the U.S. Centers for Disease Control, over the years. That, along with Rotary International's support and other nation's support, has really made a big difference. You have in your material the fact that in 1988, there were over 350,000 cases a year worldwide, and today, just last year, there were only 3,500 cases. So that is down to just one percent of what it was in 1988. Mr. Regula. The United States is fairly clean. Mr. Sever. The United States has had no polio for almost 18 years now. There has been no polio. Eradication has been complete in this hemisphere since 1991. Eradication in the Western Pacific area was achieved two years ago, so this has been focusing down. The only places in the world that polio still exists is in Southeast Asia, India, Pakistan, Bangladesh, and in Africa. So that, right now in the next five years, is the focus to complete the eradication of this disease, so that it will no longer happen. The efforts can be measured in many ways. First, of course, one can estimate the number of children who have not been paralyzed, who would have been paralyzed, if this effort had not taken place, and it now exceeds three million. The effort can be measured in terms of cost savings. In the United States, for example, although as we mentioned, we do not have any cases of polio, we still must immunize all the children in the United States for polio, because it could be brought in from one of these other areas. That costs us, in this country, about $230 million a year to immunize for a disease that we do not have. That would be, of course, saved, once the disease is eradicated. Worldwide immunization costs about $1.5 billion a year for polio. Again, on a worldwide level, that would be a tremendous savings. So both in terms of the reduction, the suffering, and the cost, just to mention two areas, there is a tremendous benefit for completing this job in the next few years. The U.S. Center for Disease Control has been a great assistance. This last year, the appropriation was for $91.4 million. When you go to Atlanta, and besides seeing the buildings, I hope that you will learn more about how they are providing epidemiologists worldwide to help participate in this eradication effort. There is a large new group in India and another group in Africa, which are vital to identifying where polio is continuing, and where it has to be immunized in carrying national immunization days; plus, providing vaccines. The Rotary is also doing this. Rotary, since 1988, has been providing money for vaccine immunizations, as well as volunteers. By the time this job is done, Rotary will have provided about $500 million towards this eradication program, from its own contributions and its own funds. We are asking this year that the appropriation be increased by $15 million, for a total of $106.4 million. The reason for that is, that the price of the vaccine has gone up from about seven cents a dose, to about 9.6 cents a dose, and because of the tremendous amount of effort that is required now in Africa specifically to get the job done. Thank you. [The information follows:] [GRAPHIC(S) NOT AVAILABLE IN TIFF FORMAT] Mr. Regula. Well, thank you very much. I think it is great that a service organization such as Rotary does get behind what is obviously a very worthwhile project. Mr. Sever. Thank you. Mr. Jackson. Mr. Chairman, I just have one question. Mr. Regula. Yes, Mr. Jackson? Mr. Jackson. Let me also congratulate you, sir, for the work that you have undertaken. To what do we owe the substantial cost increase for the cost of the polio vaccine? Mr. Sever. Well, basically, the costs of materials have gone up in the last couple of years, and the large volumes that are now being used have caused the manufacturers to have to build additional facilities, as I understand, in order to produce this. For example, in India, we had an immunization date, which is the way you would eradicate this, as we are doing in Africa. There are 17 countries in Africa, simultaneously immunizing their entire population of children under five years of age. It takes enormous amounts of vaccine, and we have had to just tremendously increase the capacities to provide this vaccine, and to have it available. In India, for example, a few weeks ago, they just immunized 140 million children in one day. There is just an unbelievable effort to that, and it is an enormous quantity of vaccine. So unfortunately, the cost of producing the vaccine and the cost of augmenting the facilities has come back in terms of this increase in vaccine costs. Mr. Jackson. Is the cost that you have requested, in terms of the increase in the program, does it approximate the size of the problem, in terms of our ability to curtail the disease by administering polio vaccines, but at the same time, does it take into account the fact that the population in many of these areas is constantly growing and expanding? Mr. Sever. It takes into consideration both, sir. The population growth is important. The issues of administration under these massive programs has to be taken into consideration. The other countries are assisting, too. The United States, I think, is the leadership of countries, but Great Britain and most European countries are also helping to try to get this job done. The fact that we are focusing on it to get it done quickly in the next five years is important, too, because we can then complete the job, and it will not have to go on and on and on. Mr. Jackson. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. Mr. Regula. Thank you. Our next witness is Lydia Lewis, who will be introduced by Mr. Jackson. Mr. Jackson. Mr. Chairman, Lydia Lewis became Executive Director of the National Depressive and Manic-Depressive Association in 1997. Headquartered in my hometown of Chicago, the National DMDA is the largest patient-directed, illness-specific organization in the country, with nearly 400 patient-run support groups throughout the country. Ms. Lewis' primary responsibility has been to position national DMDA as a leading source for information on mood disorders, and the treatments for patients, family members, health care professionals, the media, and others. She holds a bachelor's degree in psychology from the State University of New York at Buffalo. She was a charter member of the NIH Director's Counsel of Public Representatives. She also serves on the oversight committees of several large NINH clinical trials, including current trials studying the effectiveness of treatments for bi-polar disorder and the study of treatment of adolescents with depression. One of her proudest accomplishments has been her willingness to confront her own life-long battle with depression. Mr. Chairman and members of the committee, I present Ms. Lewis. ---------- Wednesday, March 21, 2001. NATIONAL DEPRESSIVE AND MANIC-DEPRESSIVE ASSOCIATION WITNESS LYDIA LEWIS, EXECUTIVE DIRECTOR, NATIONAL DEPRESSIVE AND MANIC- DEPRESSIVE ASSOCIATION Ms. Lewis. Thank you very much, Congressman Jackson; I truly appreciate the introduction. Mr. Chairman Regula and members of the subcommittee, as Congressman Jackson said, I am Lydia Lewis. I am the Executive Director of the National Depressive and Manic-Depressive Association. We appreciate the opportunity to testify in support of funding for neuro-science, behavioral science, and genetic research, through the National Institutes of Health and the National Institute of Mental Health. National DMDA applauds the doubling of the NIH budget, and encourages the subcommittee to continue providing strong leadership on this effort, which has had a significant impact on mental health research. While I am here today to testify on behalf of National DMDA, I know personally what it is like to battle depression every day, to fight the urge to end my life. It is a dreadful way to live. I, myself, suffer from the disease, and I am not alone. The recent global burden of disease study conducted by the World Health Organization, the World Bank, and Harvard University found that mental illness has long been misunderstood. In fact, it accounts for more than 15 percent of the burden of disease in established market economies. This is more than the disease burden caused by all cancers combined. More than 20 million American adults suffer from unipolar or major depression every year, and it is the leading cause of disability in the world today. An additional 2.3 million people suffer from bipolar disorder. Onset is nearly always before the age of 20, meaning more high school drop-outs, more illegal drug and alcohol use, higher teen pregnancy rates, more teen violence, and more adolescent suicides. An estimated 50 million Americans experience a mental disorder in any given year, yet only one-fourth of them actually receive mental health and other services. Women are more than twice as likely as men to experience depression. One out of every four American women will experience a major depressive episode in her lifetime. Coping with these devastating illnesses is a tragic, exhausting, and difficult way to live. Mood disorders and other mental illnesses kill people every day. Depression is the leading cause of suicide. One in every five bipolar sufferers takes his or her life; one in five. Suicide is the third leading cause of death among fifteen to twenty-four year old Americans. For every two homicides committed in the United States, there are three suicides. Despite these facts, stigmatizing mental illness is a common occurrence. Labeling people with mental illnesscontinues to send the message that de-valuing mental illness is acceptable. Equally devastating is the stigma associated with the research of mental illnesses. Research in behavioral science is as critical as that undertaken for any other illness. Our understanding of the brain is extremely limited, and will remain so for decades, unless much greater financial support is provided. Neuro-science research is also critically important to understand the mechanisms in the brain that lead to these illnesses. Every day, technology and science bring us further in understanding the brain. These kinds of successes build upon each other. Great strides are being made, but it is imperative that the progress be maintained. In 1999, the Surgeon General released the first-ever study from that office on mental illness. It concluded that these diseases are real, treatable, and affect the most vital organ in the body, the brain. We are particularly pleased that NIMH played a lead role in the Surgeon General's report on youth violence. With further research into the relationship between mental illness and violence, we are hopeful that tragedies like the recent school shootings in California and across the country can be prevented in the future. Research supported by NIMH has led to a much better understanding of these illnesses. We are learning more about their impact on other diseases, such as Parkinson's, cardio-vascular ailments, stroke, diabetes, and obesity. But more funding for NIMH and other research institutions is critical to ensure that any forward momentum is not lost. We commend the subcommittee's past support of the National Institutes of Health and the National Institute of Mental Health, and your renewed commitment to full funding of mental health research. Together, our efforts will mean real treatment options, and an end to the stigma associated with mental illness, lives saved, and a far more productive America. Again, I appreciate the opportunity to testify. [The information follows:] [GRAPHIC(S) NOT AVAILABLE IN TIFF FORMAT] Mr. Regula. Thank you. Mr. Jackson, do you have any questions? Mr. Jackson. I do not have any questions, Mr. Chairman. Mr. Regula. Thank you for coming. Ms. Lewis. Thank you. Mr. Regula. Our next witness will be Dr. George Hardy, Executive Director of the Association of State and Territorial Health Officials. Mr. Hardy, welcome. ---------- Wednesday, March 21, 2001. ASSOCIATION OF STATE AND TERRITORIAL HEALTH OFFICIALS WITNESS GEORGE E. HARDY, JR., MD, MPH, EXECUTIVE DIRECTOR, ASSOCIATION OF STATE AND TERRITORIAL HEALTH OFFICIALS Mr. Hardy. Thank you, Mr. Chairman, Mr. Jackson, and members of the subcommittee. I appreciate the opportunity to appear here this morning. My name is George Hardy. I have the privilege of serving as the Executive Director of ASTHO, the Association of State and Territorial Health Officials. In the last century, our nation has made tremendous strides in improving the health of Americans. As Dr. Sever just reminded you, we have eradicated smallpox from the globe, polio from the Americas, and we have had substantial reduction in the incidents of disease and death from major infectious and chronic diseases. We also recognize that there is a lot more that we have to do. I would like to make the case that as a nation, we need to continue our investment and research, but just as importantly, we need to invest in the transfer of research findings to public health programs. If research findings are not made available to the public, they might just as well not have been made. If society is going to be the ultimate beneficiary of our commitment to research, we need to make the same kind of commitment to investment in programming. CDC and HRSA provide the states with the resources to carry out these public health programs. ASTHO urges the committee to assure that CDC receives a total appropriation in fiscal year 2002 of $5 billion and HRSA, $6.7 billion This morning, I will discuss only a few of the important programs to states. You have heard about immunization, but you are going to hear about it again. Let me tell you how important this is. In the last 50 years, immunization programs have produced a 95 percent decline in most childhood vaccine-preventable diseases. Despite this, an estimated one million American two- year-olds have not received one or more doses of vaccine that they should have had, at that point in life. Not only must we assure that the children are adequately immunized, but we also need to assure that adolescents and adults receive needed immunization services, such as influenza, hepatitis, and pneumococcal vaccine. We thank the members of this subcommittee for ensuring that CDC received a down-payment last year on much-needed immunization funding. But as the Institute of Medicine has pointed out, additional funds are still necessary to meet the need. Just one example of such a need is the important challenge of raising immunization levels among children served by WIC programs. Specifically, we are requested $32.5 million additional dollars for CDC's immunization infrastructure program, and $93 million additional for domestic vaccine purchases. This latter figure, I know, sounds high; but it is necessary if we are going to provide the newly-approved pneumococcal vaccine for children. This vaccine will cost health departments nearly $200 per child to purchase. The preventive health and health services block grant is a component of every state's strategy to address their own unique health needs. ASTHO has just produced this new publication, ``Making a Difference,'' which I know you have seen, Mr. Chairman, and it documents the impact of public health through this program. Every state does something different. In Ohio, for instance, to just pick a state at random, the Health Department has shown a marked reduction in the incidents of adverse reactions and preventable hospital admissions, as a result of medication errors in the elderly. As I have said, every state has addressed its own problems. I think that this document will convince you of the importance of the preventative block. Since its inception 20 years ago, funding for the preventive block grant has been stagnant. It has not kept pace with inflation. It has not been adjusted for the increasing population, or for the new public health needs that were not even known at the time it was created, such as AIDS and West Nile Virus. We are asking the subcommittee to provide an additional $75 million for that block grant. Last year, the Congress enacted the Public Health Threats and Emergencies Act, to address bioterrorism, antimicrobial resistance, and public health capacity. Each of these are critically important, and we would urge the subcommittee to fully fund the $534 million that is authorized for these services. Many other programs at CDC and HRSA deserve this committee's attention. The Maternal and Child Health Block Grant and the Ryan White Care Act, both programs at HRSA, are critical to the states, and we support the request of $850 million for the MCH block grant. I want to close by expressing again our appreciation to this subcommittee for its past commitment to public health. Your work has made a tremendous difference in the lives of people, and we are going to need your help again this year, as we try to advance the health of our Nation. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. [The information follows:] [GRAPHIC(S) NOT AVAILABLE IN TIFF FORMAT] Mr. Regula. Well, thank you very much for your comments. I am sure there is a great need there. The next witness is Dr. Thomas Clemens, Professor of Medicine and Molecular and Cell Physiology, University of Cincinnati. ---------- Wednesday, March 21, 2001. NATIONAL COALITION FOR OSTEOPOROSIS AND RELATED BONE DISEASES WITNESS DR. THOMAS L. CLEMENS, PROFESSOR OF MEDICINE AND MOLECULAR AND CELL PHYSIOLOGY, UNIVERSITY OF CINCINNATI COLLEGE OF MEDICINE, NATIONAL COALITION FOR OSTEOPOROSIS AND RELATED BONE DISEASES Dr. Clemens. Thanks, Mr. Chairman and Congressman Jackson. My name is Tom Clemens. I work at the University of Cincinnati. I do basic research in bone biology. With me is Charles Hall, a patient with fibrous dysplasia. The National Coalition for Osteoporosis and Related Bone Diseases appreciates this opportunity to present our position on the need for continued and expanded funding for osteoporosis and related bond disease research at the National Institutes of Health. We also appreciate the committee's past support for the goal of doubling the NIH budget, and last year's significant increase. The bone diseases represented by our coalition occur in all populations and at all ages. They are devastating diseases, with significant physical, psycho-social, and financial consequences, including pain, disability, and death. Consider, if you will, what we already know about how our bones function. Throughout life, our bone is constantly being remodeled through repeated cycles of bone breakdown and bone build-up. As we age, this balance shifts in favor of bone breakdown, rather than bone build-up. If unchecked, this delicate balancing act goes awry, and this results in bone disease. Our increasing understanding of this process has led to exciting new drug therapies, that balance out. Yet, bone disease still has no cure, and there are many important questions remaining unanswered. What are the major bone diseases? One is osteoporosis, the most prevalent bone disease in this country. It is characterized by low bone mass and structural deterioration of bone. Ten million Americans have osteoporosis, and 18 million more have low bone mass, placing them at risk of the disease. In 1995, osteoporosis was responsible for 2.5 million physician visits; 180,000 nursing home omissions, and over 400,000 hospital admissions. The direct cost of fracture is $13.8 billion, which should triple by the year 2040. Paget's disease of bone is a chronic disorder that may result in enlarged or deformed bones in one or more regions of the skeleton. Complications may include arthritis, fractures, bowing of the limbs, and hearing loss. Paget's affects up to eight percent of our population over 60. That is two to three million Americans. Osteogenesis Imperfecta is a genetic disorder that is typically diagnosed in infancy. Osteogenesis imperfecta causes bones to break easily. For example, a cough or a sneeze can break a rib; simply rolling over in bed can break a leg. Osteogenesis Imperfecta affects an estimated 30,000 adults, children and infants in the United States, causing as many as several hundred broken bones in a lifetime. I understand from Mr. Grove, Chairman Regula, that you have actually had the opportunity to see a number of these patients at the Institute of Child Health. Fibrous dysplasia, which affects Mr. Hall, is a chronic disease of the skeleton, which causes expansion of one or more bones, due to the development of a fibrous scar within the bone. This weakens the bone, causing pain, deformity, disability, and fracture. At present, there are no approved therapies for this disease. Osteopetrosis is a disease present at birth, at which bones are overly dense. This is due, again, to an imbalance between bone formation and bone breakdown. Complications often begin before the age of five, and include fractures, frequent infections, and problems with sight and blood vessel disease. The National Institute of Arthritis and Muscular Skeletal and Skin Diseases, NIAMS, leads the Federal research effort on bone disease; however, the need for trans-NIH search is vital. Bone- related disease cuts across many research institutes at the NIH. Given the breadth and depth of these diseases, we urge the committee to instruct NIH to make this one of its top trans-NIH priorities. With the steady greying of Americans, now is the time to find solutions to these dehabilitating diseases, in order to alleviate the stress that will be placed on the Medicare system in the future. Vast opportunities still exit to expand our current knowledge base. Initiatives that may serve as springboards to further research include: basic research, funded by the NIH; and clinical trials with power-thyroid hormone, or PTH, the newest front-line treatment for osteoporosis. One form of PTH has just been submitted to the FDA for approval. Researchers still do not really know how it functions at the cellular level. While osteoporosis was once thought to be a woman's disease, it is now an important issue among men. An estimated one-third of hip fractures, worldwide, occur in men, including the one recently sustained by President Ronald Reagan. A major study on how the disease affects men is currently underway and supported by the NIH. In the area of osteogenesis imperfecta, researchers are exploring the effectiveness of a drug that appears to increase bone marrow density and decrease bone loss. Finally, a new clinical center for patients with fibrous dysplasia was recently established at the NIH, and has proved to be a resource for physicians and patients around the country, while furthering research on this crippling disease. Mr. Chairman, the research community sincerely appreciates the committee's efforts over the years to ensure continued strength of the NIH research program. The high value that we continue to place on biomedical research will lead to the prevention of disease, reduce disability, and decrease the staggering health care costs associated with bone and other diseases. Just let me say one more thing before I finish, and that concerns the timing of our request. With the completion of the human genome project, researchers right now are poised to make new discoveries and identify new gene targets. This is going to be absolutely essential, so the timing of our request is critical. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. [The information follows:] [GRAPHIC(S) NOT AVAILABLE IN TIFF FORMAT] Mr. Regula. Do you deal with brittle bones? Mr. Clemens. Yes, and the one disease that I did mention, osteopetrosis, is called marble bone disease. Osteogenesis imperfecta is also associated with brittle bones, and is called actually Brittle Bone Disease. Mr. Regula. That is a very difficult challenge. Are there any questions, Mr. Jackson? Mr. Jackson. Mr. Chairman, just by virtue of the fact that NIAMS is an institute at NIH, and they are already engaged in trans-NIH research on many of the diseases that you indicated, is there a specific funding request for any of the diseases that you mentioned, that should be covered, above and beyond what the committee and the President have already made a commitment to do? I am not so sure that I actually heard that in your testimony. Mr. Clemens. We would recommend a 16.5 percent increase for NIAMS; but I wanted to stress the trans-NIH funding; because there are institutes, for example, child health and the cancer institutes, where these bone diseases are also funded. So we would like to recommend the 6.5 increase, with the trans-NIH funding for that. That is not over and above 16.5 percent. Mr. Regula. Thank you very much. Our next witness is Lawrence Pizzi, Volunteer, North American Brain Tumor Coalition. ---------- Wednesday, March 21, 2001 NORTH AMERICAN BRAIN TUMOR COALITION WITNESS LAWRENCE PIZZI, VOLUNTEER, NORTH AMERICAN BRAIN TUMOR COALITION Mr. Pizzi. Good afternoon, Mr. Chairman. I am going to follow suit with many of my predecessors, and tell you that although I was born overseas, my first and earliest memories are Kent, Ohio. [Laughter.] Mr. Regula. You are getting close. Mr. Pizzi. I knew I had to come up with something. Mr. Regula. Well, Chicago and Ohio have done well today. Mr. Pizzi. My name is Larry Pizzi. It is my privilege to appear today as a representative of the North American Brain Tumor Coalition, a network of 12 charitable organizations that raise funds for brain tumor research, and provide information and support to individuals with brain tumors, their families, and their friends. We corroborate in advocacy to increase brain tumor research. We also work to guarantee that every brain tumor patient has access to the best possible health care. I am also the Executive Director of one of the coalition's founding member organizations, and the only member of the coalition not represented by one of the states on this committee. I am from Massachusetts. Most importantly, though, I am the father of Timothy Lawrence Pizzi, a child diagnosed with a brain tumor in 1989. He lived nearly seven years, before dying at the age of 12. Mr. Regula. This was your son? Mr. Pizzi. Yes, my son. Mr. Regula. He was born with the tumor? Mr. Pizzi. He was diagnosed at age six with a tumor that he probably had since birth. He died at age 12. He and thousands like him, children and adults, are the reason that my testimony today is a privilege, and I thank you. Brain tumors are a unique disease and present special challenges for all that they touch. Brain tumors are not a single disease. Instead, there are at least 126 types of central nervous system tumors. It is difficult to treat brain tumors, not only because of their diversity, but because of the unique biology of the brain. I am sure that you can understand how it is possible to remove a lung, a breast, or prostate that is affected by cancer; but we cannot remove the brain. Treatment strategies that are successful with other cancers cannot be used to treat brain tumors. Moreover, brain tumors affect the organ that make us who we are. They are a disease not only of the body, but also of the soul. They are a disease of the quality of life. A recent Government study accurately defined a brain tumor's impact as mental impairment, seizures, and paralysis that affect the very core of a person, and have a demoralizing effect on loved ones. Added to these burdens is the knowledge that for most brain tumors, adequate treatment is not available. In children, even if they do survive the devastating impact of the treatment, it often leaves them with permanent damage. However, these are exciting times, and there is hope for progress. I would simply echo those who have come before me, and ask that we continue to fund the National Institutes of Health in such a way that we essentially double the research budget by the year 2003. We join the other patient organizations in commending this committee for its role in that progress, and we would ask that you continue it. Brain tumor research suffers from a lack of trained clinical investigators. Good funding is going to be very important to continue attract them. Mr. Regula. Is there any one institution that is focusing on this, that you are aware of? Mr. Pizzi. That is my next point. We have been urging for a number of years corroboration between the two institutes at the National Institutes of Health, that have responsibility for brain tumors, the NINDS and NCI. That is the National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke and the National Cancer Institute. I am very glad to say that over the last year, we have seen much progress in that area, resulting in this document by a progress review group, that was carried out jointly bythe NINDS and the NCI, and advocates in the extra-mural community. I am here today to ask you and your committee to ensure that this progress review group document, which represents a true corroboration between Government, the private sector, and the advocacy sector, not become a document on a shelf. These organizations, the NCI and the NINDS, have worked very well together to produce a national strategy for attacking this disease. We have a couple of specific requests. One is that we enhance brain tumor research through continuing the corroboration that this document represents. The two institutes should strengthen their mechanisms for coordination and corroboration among extra-mural researchers. The written version of my testimony contains the details of how we would like this accomplished. They should organize and fund a series of inter- disciplinary meetings, of researchers that would focus on the subjects of brain tumor biology. They, along with the Center for Scientific Review, should make sure that study sections, or the people who look at the grant requests coming up from the field, saying yes, we should fund this or no, we should not, have the right expertise to evaluate brain tumor grants. Currently, they do not. Mr. Regula. You do not think they are capable of making judgments on the allocation of the resource money? Mr. Pizzi. Brain tumors are highly specialized. Our experience is that the specialists who make up the brain tumor community are not adequately represented on those. I will close with this point. In addition, there is the recently established NCI-NINDS Neuro-oncology Branch. They see this as great progress, because it represents the two institutions. We would like to see that branch continue, to not only work intermurally in Bethesda, but to be sort of the focal point for the corroboration. I would like to tell you that my son was very close to a very prominent brain tumor researcher. His name was Dr. Mark Israel. One day shortly before my son died, knowing that he would die, he called Mark on the telephone, and asked him the question that he would always love to ask him, ``Mark, are still looking for a cure?'' Mark, of course, told him that he was. Timothy said to him, ``Now would be a good time.'' It did not work for Tim, or thousands of others, since he died five years ago. He became part of one statistic that I will leave you with. Brain tumors are the leading cause of cancer deaths in children under the age of 20, now surpassing acute lymphoblastic leukemia, and are the third leading cause of cancer deaths in young adults, ages 20 to 39. We applaud the dedication of this subcommittee to advancing biomedical research. We look forward to working with you to support brain tumor research at a time when advances, we believe, are truly going to be possible, and to make a time when the Timothys of this world will have a much brighter future. I thank you. [The information follows:] [GRAPHIC(S) NOT AVAILABLE IN TIFF FORMAT] Mr. Regula. Thank you. What are the choices, since you cannot use chemicals or chemotherapy? Mr. Pizzi. Brain tumors are resistent, generally, to chemotherapy, because of the nature of the biology of the brain. Radiation is a very common treatment; but, of course, it does a lot of damage to normal, healthy brain tissue. So we have a case where the treatment can leave the patient cured or in remission, but with so many deficits. Nearly 80 percent of adults who have brain tumors or are treated for them are unable to go back to work, even though they are still alive. Children who are treated for brain tumors live the rest of their lives with cognitive deficits. So it is just the nature of where it is, Mr. Chairman. It is truly a unique organ of the body. There are 126 kinds of them. There is no other cancer that has that many sub-sets of a disease. Mr. Regula. It puts pressure on the brain. Mr. Pizzi. Automatically, and that, of course, is a major problem. Mr. Regula. I had a friend that died that way. Thank you very much. Mr. Pizzi. Thank you very much for your time. Our next witness is Ken Moss, Friends of Cancer Research. Mr. Moss? ---------- Wednesday, March 21, 2001 FRIENDS OF CANCER RESEARCH WITNESS DR. KEN MOSS, FRIENDS OF CANCER RESEARCH Ms. Segal. Good afternoon, Mr. Chairman, I am Ellen Segal of Friends of Cancer Research. I am pleased to introduce to you Dr. Ken Moss. He is from your home state of Ohio, from Cleveland. He is an endothesiologist, and he also teaches at Case Western. Dr. Moss and his wife Anita are going to put a human face on this disease, and talk about their daughter Elisa. You will hear from Dr. Moss. Dr. Moss. Dr. Moss. Thank you. Chairman Regula and members of the subcommittee, thank you for the opportunity to testify today. I come before you not as a physician, but as a father of a beautiful and talented 17 year old, who passed away last October from cancer. I took this photo on Elisa's high school graduation, almost four months before she died. She looked exactly the same way on that fateful day in October. In fact, hours before she died, she stopped in front of the mirror on the way out the door to the doctor's office, telling her mother that she was going to put on makeup, so that no one would be able to tell that, ``I am a cancer patient.'' Elisa was gifted and mature beyond her years. Almost everyone she met liked her. Over 900 people attended her funeral. Classmates flew home from college from as far away as California, because Elisa meant that much to them. It is impossible in five minutes to tell you of all the anguish, fear and frustration that we felt as we watched helplessly as cancer slowly took her. While returning from a New Year's cruise in January of 1998, my daughter noticed pain in her thigh. I did not think anything of it; however, the pain persisted. Within a few weeks, my wife arranged for a MRI. A mass was found and quickly biopsied. ``I am sorry, but your daughter has cancer.'' No statement will strike more terror into a parent than that. Even worse, Elisa had a rare, highly malignant tumor. The prognosis was a 20 percent five year survival. As a parent, I was devastated; but as a doctor, I simply could not accept it. We took her to Memorial Sloan Kettering for a second opinion. They recommended high dose chemotherapy, surgical excision, and a bone marrow transplant. Throughout the chemotherapy that caused extreme illness, loss of her hair, and most importantly, forced her to remain at home and stop going to school, Elisa fought back. She never gave up and she never complained. During each of the 12 surgical procedures that she had in the two years that followed her diagnosis, she always remained optimistic, and she was an inspiration to everyone who knew her. In August, 1998, Elisa underwent a stem cell transplant. Yet, six months later, she relapsed, with a tumor in her lung. After a biopsy confirmed the worst, a big debate ensured about what to do. Traditional medicine had failed her, so we examined experimental protocols at the National Cancer Institute. One study in particular had promise, and Elisa, who had always played an active role in her treatment, agreed. This began a period of four months of commuting to Bethesda with Elisa. But the home run that we had hoped run was not to be, and by August 1, 1999, it was clear to investigators that Elisa was not responding and, in fact, her tumors were doubling, both in size and in number, each month. I brought Elisa back home to the Cleveland Clinic, and her doctor sat me down and told me that she had less than three months to live, and that her only chance was more chemotherapy, to hopefully shrink the tumors and buy her more time. To me, this was insanity, doing the same thing again, and expecting a different result. I knew that her only hope was to target the cancer cells by other means, such as attacking the tumors' blood supply. My family and I had already read all the literature. We were knowledgeable about the tremendous advances that were being made with different agents. There were so many promising treatments on the horizon; if only we had the time to wait for the studies to be carried out; time for new drugs to come to market. But we did not, and Elisa had only three months to live. Elisa's doctors at the Cleveland Clinic accepted my suggestion that we try a radically different approach that was only vaguely described in one person and in animal studies. The treatment which we modified constantly over the next 13 months significantly slowed her tumor growth. Not only did Elisa not die, she went with us on a 10 day Christmas cruise, and had a ball. In March, Elisa returned to high school and completed her senior year. She went to prom and lived as normally as she could, despite the fact that twice a week, in our family room, I would hook her up to an IV, and administer the experimental treatment. She graduated with highest honors, and was accepted to Case Western Reserve University, where she intended to get a combined degree in nutrition and biochemistry. Sadly, her time ran out before the treatment protocol that we were using could be fine-tuned. Elisa was content to live with her cancer. She was hopeful that we could convert it to a chronic disease. Elisa's dream can become a reality if Congress and the White House live up to the five year commitment to double the NIH budget. If the Government falters on the commitment, at a time of great excitement and optimism amongst cancer researchers, the momentum will be lost. It is also essential to fund NCI's bypass budget request, which is a comprehensive national plan for cancer research. There is hope in the near future for effective treatment alternatives, and promising laboratory research awaits clinical studies, such as those underway at the NCI. No single treatment will effectively control cancer. Combinations of different treatments will be necessary. Costly clinical studies of treatment combinations must be started. Elisa did not die because she had incurable cancer. My daughter died because we did not know how to control it. A week before she died, she said her goodbyes. She made one request to each member of her family. She requested that my son, Jordan, name his first-born child after her. She requested that my wife, Anita, visit her grave every day, for the first year. To me, she asked that I ensure that her death would not be in vain; that something positive would result from it. It is for this reason that I come before you today. Please do not allow Elisa's legacy to die. Thank you. [The information follows:] [GRAPHIC(S) NOT AVAILABLE IN TIFF FORMAT] Mr. Regula. We will try. Thank you for coming. Our next witness will be Michaelle Wormley, Executive Director of Women Opting for More Affordable Housing Now, Inc. ---------- Wednesday, March 21, 2001. WOMEN OPTING FOR MORE AFFORDABLE HOUSING NOW, INC. WITNESSES MICHAELLE WORMLEY, EXECUTIVE DIRECTOR OF WOMEN OPTING FOR MORE AFFORDABLE HOUSING NOW, INC. JOANNE KANE, EXECUTIVE DIRECTOR OF THE MCAULEY INSTITUTE Ms. Wormley. Good afternoon, Mr. Chairman and members of the subcommittee. You have my written statement. I will just provide you with some of the highlights. I am Michaelle Wormley, the Executive Director of Women Opting for More Affordable Housing Now, WOMAN, Incorporated. We are a Southeast Texas non-profit organization, that creates affordable, livable transitional housing, and supportive services for women living in abusive relationships. We are asking for at least $25 million for fiscal year 2002, for a housing assistance program authorized under the Violence Against Women Act last year. WOMAN, Inc. grew out of a networking group of nine battered women's shelters and service providers in a 13 county area, including Houston, Dallas, and Beaumont, Texas. Our long-term goal, since we were founded in 1993, has been developing transitional housing facilities at each of the nine locations represented in the consortium. Each sponsor provides comprehensive social services and property management, while WOMAN, Inc. may finance, own, maintain, operate and sell the properties it develops in order to provide the most cost-effective project that is affordable to woman earning 50 percent or less of the medium income. I am accompanied today by JoAnne Kane, Executive Director of the McAuley Institute. McAuley was founded by the Sisters of Mercy in 1983, and is the only national faith-based housing organization that focuses its resources on low income women and families. McAuley has worked closely with WOMAN, Inc. since 1993, providing both technical assistance and financial services. Many of the women who participate in housing programs and related services provided by the community-based groups like WOMAN, Inc. are survivors of domestic violence. As housing providers, the dilemma that we saw was that families, having begun to stabilize their lives in a shelter program had only one choice when seeking affordable housing; that of returning to their batterers. Our vision was to provide survivors more viable options for restoring their lives. That vision was honored by the Fannie Mae Foundation with the maximum Awards of Excellence in May of 1999, and recognition of our Destiny Village Project in Pasadena, Texas. Destiny Village is a 30 unit apartment complex, which provides supported housing to families leaving domestic violence. Over the past several years, McAuley, along with a coalition of 200 groups representing domestic violence and sexual assault survivors have strived to re-authorize the Violence Against Women Act with the Housing Assistance Program. With the October, 2000 Enactment of VAWA 2000, our goal was partially realized. VAWA housing assistance would provide a bridge, up to eighteen months, to help survivors secure a stable, secure environment for themselves and their children. The new law requires that the housing assistance must be needed to prevent homelessness, and may be used for rent, utilities, security deposits, or other costs of relocation. Support services to enable survivors to obtain permanent housing, and to aid their integration into a community, including transportation, counseling, child care services, case management, and employment counseling could be supported with grant funds. VAWA enjoyed strong bipartisan support, and the Congress clearly intended to create and fund a viable housing assistance program under VAWA. We fully expect the program to be extended this year as part of the Child Abuse Prevention and Treatment Act, for which the current authorization is five years, and expires this year. The need for this program is critical. According to the U.S. Conference of Mayors 1999 survey of 26 cities, domestic violence was listed as the fifth leading cause of homelessness. The Texas Department of Human Services figures indicate that for the fiscal ending 1998, 3,796 adults were denied shelter, due to lack of space. A conservative estimate from HUD's homeless office is that nine percent of all clients serviced came directly from a domestic violence situation. An informal poll of domestic service providers nationwide, conducted over the last two months about a national coalition against domestic violence, the number one funding need identified by shelter based programs was for transitional housing for battered women. The importance of housing assistance to families fleeing abusive situations cannot be overstated. Short-term housing aid and targeted supportive services can help survivors bridge the gap between financial and emotional dependency, and productive, healthy, and life-sustaining environments for themselves and their children. We ask that you provide $25 million for VAWA housing assistance for the coming year. JoAnne, did you want to speak? Ms. Kane. The experience of WOMAN, Inc. is duplicated across the country, both as a direct response to the woman fleeing violence, and an example of successful programs, created by local women leaders to deal with some of our nation's most intractable problems. These women leaders project a solely pathological assessment, which looks at violence alone as the problem. They craft multi-faceted programs that combine human development and community development, family health andcommunity building strategies. The care-givers are often finding themselves in the same situation as the women, knowing that housing is the one solution, and yet finding that the opportunities for women decline daily. There are 5.4 million worse case housing needs in this country, and 60 percent are women. So the appropriation is needed, a system and a practical system is ready to respond, and their are women for whom the opportunity is not just a home of their own, but an opportunity to leave family violence behind forever. Thank you. [The information follows:] [GRAPHIC(S) NOT AVAILABLE IN TIFF FORMAT] Mr. Regula. Thank you. Do the habitat programs help? Ms. Wormley. They are a critical response to the need. However, again, in trying to assure stability for the mothers and the children, transitional housing is very critical. Mr. Regula. Thank you very much. Our next witness is Jerold Goldberg, Dean, Case Western Reserve, School of Dentistry. Welcome to the panel. ---------- Wednesday, March 21, 2001. HEALTH PROFESSIONS AND NURSING EDUCATION COALITION [HPNEC] WITNESS JEROLD GOLDBERG, D.M.D., DEAN, CASE WESTERN RESERVE UNIVERSITY SCHOOL OF DENTISTRY, TESTIFYING ON BEHALF OF THE HEALTH PROFESSIONS AND NURSING EDUCATION COALITION [HPNEC] Mr. Goldberg. Mr. Chairman, I am Jerry Goldberg, Dean of the Case Western Reserve University School of Dentistry. I am testifying today on behalf of the Health Professions and Nursing Education Coalition [HPNEC]. This is an informal alliance of over 40 organizations, dedicated to ensure that Title 7 and 8 programs continue to help educate the Nation's health care personnel. These programs improve the accessibility, quality, and racial and ethnic diversity of the health care work force. In addition to providing unique and essential training and education opportunities, these programs help meet the health care delivery needs of under-served areas in this country. At times, they serve as the only source of health care in many rural and disadvantaged communities. Additionally, the graduates of Bureau of Health Profession- funded programs are three to ten times more likely than average graduates to participate in medically under-served communities. These programs graduate two to five times more minority and disadvantaged students. As the Nation's health care delivery system rapidly changes and makes dramatic changes, the Bureau of Health Professions has identified the following five priorities, to ensure that all providers are prepared to meet the challenges of the health care in the 21st Century. They are: geriatrics, genetics, diversity, and informatics. HPNEC has determined that these programs require $550 million to educate and train the health care work force that addresses these priorities. As part of the two year effort to reach this goal, HPNEC recommends at least $440 million dollars for Title 7 and 8 in fiscal year 2002. These figures do not include funding for the Childrens Hospital's Graduate Medical Education Program, and are now separate from Title 7 and 8 funding. The programs are organized in the following categories: minority and disadvantaged health professions; primary care medicine and dentistry; interdisciplinary, community-based linkages; health professions work force information and analysis; public health work force development; Nurse Education Act; and student financial assistance. A serious defect in our health care system is the lack of dental care for low income populations and those in under- served areas. With funding from Title 7, institutions are able to provide oral health to these under-served populations. Dentists who have benefitted from advanced training in general dentistry and pediatric dentistry consistently refer fewer patients to specialists, which is especially important in rural and under-served urban areas, where logistics and financial barriers can make specialized care unobtainable. The Bureau of Health Professions in HRSA provides threeyear grants to start expanded programs and to expand programs, after which time, these programs must be self-sufficient. Eighty-seven percent of the dentists who go through these programs remain in primary care practice. Members of HPNEC are concerned that the Administration has severely cut or even eliminated portions of Title 7 and 8 funding. It states in the health profession section of the budget blueprint that ``Today a physician shortage no longer exists. Moreover, the Federal role is questionable in this area, given that these professions are well paid, and that market forces are much more likely to influence and determine supply.'' We contend that typical market forces do not eliminate work force shortages in under-served areas, and that their effect on skyrocketing costs of living has directly contributed to the kind of health care professionals in these regions. HPNEC has provided a letter to the President, outlining this position. We appreciate the subcommittee's support in the past. We look to you again to support these programs and their essential role in the health care system. Thank you for accepting this testimony. [The information follows:] [GRAPHIC(S) NOT AVAILABLE IN TIFF FORMAT] Mr. Regula. Thank you for bringing this to our attention. Our next witness is Dr. Frankie Roman, Medical Director, Center for Sleep Disorders, at Doctors Hospital in Massillon, Ohio. We are happy to welcome you, my next door neighbor, almost. Dr. Roman. For a second, Mr. Chairman, I thought you were avoiding your neighbor. [Laughter.] ---------- Wednesday, March 21, 2001. NATIONAL SLEEP FOUNDATION WITNESS FRANKIE ROMAN, M.D., MEDICAL DIRECTOR, CENTER FOR SLEEP DISORDERS, NATIONAL SLEEP FOUNDATION Dr. Roman. Good afternoon, Mr. Chairman and Congressional staff members. Thank you for inviting me to present testimony this morning, or this afternoon, on behalf of the National Sleep Foundation. We have submitted written testimony to the official record, and I would like to use my time to address some of the major points regarding how sleep disorders, sleep deprivation, and fatigue impact the Nation's health and safety. As the Chairman mentioned, I am based in Massillon, Ohio. I drive through Navarro, Ohio, his home town every day. I just want to make my Ohio connection clear. The National Sleep Foundation is an independent non-profit organization that works with thousands of sleep experts, patients, and drowsy driving victims throughout the country, to prevent health and safety problems, related to fatigue and untreated sleep disorders. The Foundation's interest today in the subcommittee's work is based on the National Sleep Foundation's relationship with the Center for Disease Control and Prevention, and specifically with the National Center for Injury Prevention and Control. The NSF today is asking the subcommittee to consider providing an additional $1.5 million to the center's fiscal year 2002 funding, to address sleep deprivation and fatigue- related injuries. Sleep represents a third of every person's life, and has a tremendous impact on how we function, perform, and think during the other two-thirds. Unfortunately, that is the first thing we sacrifice. We give up sleep to attend all these Congressional hearings and Congressional fund raisers later on in the evening. Too many of us forget that lack of adequate, restful slumber has serious consequences at home, in the work place, at school, and on the highway. Members of Congress are not immune to this. If you recall, Mr. Chairman, I did an informal survey a few years ago, with the help of your office. We found that seven percent of the Congressional members fall asleep during these Congressional hearings. Mr. Regula. Maybe it has got something to do with the witnesses. Dr. Roman. Well, hopefully it does not. The numbers were worse for the Congressional staff members, so I am not even going to mention that, just for them. It just shows that the ill effects of sleep deprivation are suffered by all, including members of Congress. This is something that touches each and every person in this country. Tragically, drowsy driving claims more than 1,500 lives, and accounts for at least 100,000 crashes in the UnitedStates, every year. The sad thing is that these incidents are preventable. Just this past week, Mr. Chairman, I saw a school bus driver from our community, who fell asleep at the wheel, and the kids are complaining about how the bus is wagging. I have seen many police officers, I have actually seen some of your Congressional members, I have seen elected officials from the school and the Government in our community; and so I do not put a face or a name today before you. However, I ask you, the next time you go to your community, look around and you will see that this is an issue that affects each and every one of us. Many of the groups before you, too, would benefit from my request today, or what the National Sleep Foundation is trying to accomplish through the CDC. Fatigue or sleep deprivation should be considered an impairment like alcohol and drugs. New research shows that a person who has been awake for 24 consecutive hours demonstrates the same impairment in judgment and reaction time, as an adult who is legally drunk. Today, it is unacceptable to drive or work under the influence of drugs and alcohol. Fatigue should fall under the same category. The National Sleep Foundation has worked with volunteers like myself for the next decade to raise awareness and minimize fatigue-related injuries. While public awareness is desperately needed, a strong Federal partner with the expertise and the ability to disseminate, test, and improve education, training and injury prevention programs to communities like ours in Stark County, Ohio, is crucial to attacking these problems. We feel that the CDC is our partner, and should help the NSF and public health officials address these problems. We have data telling us that lack of sleep affects the Nation on many different levels, from the airline pilot, and I have several pilots of that nature, to the child in the classroom, I receive many with a court order coming to see me; and from the Amish. Surprisingly, even though they have a simple life style, they are identifying sleep disorders as a problem in their day-to-day lives. This research is absolutely no good if we cannot translate it into education and injury prevention programs for the general public. Public education, physician and police training, school-based programs and work place prevention programs are all desperately needed. We believe that the CDC can and should play a vital role, working with the sleep community to address these problems by developing a sleep awareness plan that would set national priorities around sleep issues and public health and safety. This proposed sleep awareness program would allow the CDC and other Federal agencies to develop and distribute accurate medically sound information in programs to local communities. This information, coupled with training for those involved with public health and safety at the state level, will begin to turn the tide of injuries, health problems, and costs associated with sleepiness and sleep disorders, which I see on a daily basis. I thank you, Mr. Chairman, for your time. Again, we wish that the subcommittee would consider increasing the overall budget for the center by $1.5 million, to allow the center to act as a coordinating body for the development and implementation of this five year sleep awareness plan. Thank you for your consideration in this request. I would be glad to answer any questions that you may have. [The information follows:] [GRAPHIC(S) NOT AVAILABLE IN TIFF FORMAT] Mr. Regula. It seems to me that you are talking about two different things, disorders and deprivation. Deprivation is lifestyle. Dr. Roman. Yes, but we consider it a disorder, also, because many of the sleep disorders cause sleep deprivation. Only through education and awareness will people realize that it is just not lifestyle, and that there are other things going on. Mr. Regula. Do you try to treat physical causes, or just try to treat the habits of people; that they just do not get enough sleep, they do not go to bed on time, and so on. Dr. Roman. We do both, Mr. Chairman. Mr. Regula. Are there certain physical causes that people do not sleep well, and is that something you treat? Dr. Roman. Yes, the most common one that we see is sleep apnea. That is people who snore and stop breathing in their sleep. Most of their manifestation is, I do not get enough sleep, or I feel tried when I wake up. These are people who fall asleep in different social situations, including driving or at work, or even on the toilet seat. Mr. Regula. Well, I suppose our societal lifestyle has something to do with it, the demands are so great. Dr. Roman. Unfortunately, the first thing that we all sacrifice is sleep, to get in all the activities, social, professional, and personal, that we would like. What we aretrying to educate the public is, this is a major mistake. Mr. Regula. Is there any magic number? I see different numbers. You should have six hours, seven hours, eight hours. Would that not depend a little bit on the physiology on the individual? Dr. Roman. Yes, the average is around eight hours. But there are some people who require less sleep, and some that require more. You cannot train yourself to sleep less. That is a myth; where you can say, I can get by with only four hours. What we do as a society, most Americans, we are chronically sleep deprived, and on the weekends, we make up, we sleep in; which, unfortunately, makes us start off the next week in a bind. For example, next week, which is National Sleep Awareness Week, and our clock shifts forward, there is a seven percent increase in accidents that Monday. It does not matter if you spring forward or fall back with our clock, but there is a seven percent increase. So I strongly recommend that no one drive next Monday. Mr. Regula. You should stay home from work; is that it? [Laughter.] Well, you apparently have got an ally in our President. He seems to have good habits about going to bed early, and that will be helpful. Dr. Roman. He also takes naps, which we strongly recommend. Unfortunately, it is very un-American to take naps. Mr. Regula. I thinking about one, myself, if I can get through this list. [Laughter.] Dr. Roman. I thank you for your time, Mr. Chairman. I am available in our community, as I am your neighbor. I will always be available to you. Thank you very much. Mr. Regula. Well, thank you for coming. Next is Deborah Neale, a member of the Ohio Chapter Executive Committee of the Ohio State Public Affairs Committee. ---------- Wednesday, March 21, 2001. OHIO CHAPTER EXECUTIVE COMMITTEE OF THE OHIO STATE PUBLIC AFFAIRS COMMITTEE WITNESS DEBORAH NEAL, MEMBER, OHIO CHAPTER EXECUTIVE COMMITTEE OF THE OHIO STATE PUBLIC AFFAIRS COMMITTEE Ms. Neal. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. Good afternoon, I am Debbie Neal, a long time volunteer of the March of Dimes. I also bring you greetings from our former State Senator Grace Drake, who has just agreed to be on our committee in Cleveland, Ohio. As you know, the March of Dimes is a national voluntary health agency, founded in 1938 by President Roosevelt, to find a cure for polio. Today, the three million foundation volunteers and 1,600 staff members in every state, the District of Columbia, and Puerto Rico, work to improve the health of infants and children, by preventing birth defects and infant mortality. I am here today seeking the prioritization of funds to improve and health and well being of mothers, infants, and children, through research, prevention of birth defects, and developmental disabilities, and improved access to care. I am not here to lobby for funds for the March of Dimes, as less than one percent of the Foundation's funding comes from Federal sources. The Foundation supports continuing the five year effort to double the funding. We are especially interested in three issues within the National Institutes of Health. First, the National Institute for Child Health and Human Development should have the resources to expand research on birth defects and developmental biology, allowing for testing of new treatments for autism, and further research on Fragile X, which is the most common inherited cause of mental retardation. Secondly, we recommend increased funding for the National Human Genome Research Institute, to allow scientists to develop the next generation of research tools, and thereby accelerate an understanding of genomics. Third, other activities at NIH strongly supported by the Foundation include work being done by the National Center on Minority Health and Disparities; advancement of treatment options for sickle cell disease; and extra-mural research through the Pediatric Research Initiative. As you know, Mr. Chairman, last year, the Children's Health Act of 2000 created a new center on birth defects and developmental disabilities at CDC, bringing the number of centers that make up the CEC to seven. Support in Congress for this new center is indicative of the importance that members place on research and prevention activities related to birth defects. The new center begins operations in mid-April, April 15th, and we encourage the subcommittee to commit the resources needed to ensure a successful launch. Currently, three-quarters of the states monitor the incidents of birth defects. However, the systems vary considerably. CDC is working with states to standardize datacollection through 26 cooperative agreements, lasting three years each. However, funds are not adequate to support all the states seeking assistance, including our own state of Ohio. The March of Dimes recommends adding $2 million to CDC's state-based birth defects surveillance program. This CDC also supports eight regional birth defects research and prevention centers, where groundbreaking work on spina bifida, heart defects, Downs Syndrome, and other serious, life-threatening conditions present at birth are underway. Increased funding would allow additional data collection to study genetic and environmental causes of birth defects. The March of Dimes recommends adding $8 million to the budget for these eight centers. Developmental disabilities, monitoring and research are also important, and the Foundation supports CDC's plan to create five regional research centers to study developmental disabilities, such as autism, cerebral palsy, mental retardation, and hearing and vision deficits. The funding needed is $5 million. The new Center on Birth Defects and Developmental Disabilities will administer the folic acid education campaign and newborn screening program. The current folic acid education campaign has been inadequate, and should be funded at a greater level of $5 million for 2002, with an estimate by 2006. This life-saving intervention is needed to reduce the number of babies born with neural tube defects. Newborn screening for metabolic diseases and functional disorders such as PKU, sickle cell disease, and hearing impairment is a great advance in preventative medicine. To support newborn screening, the foundation recommends an increase, so that CDC can provide states the technical assistance needed to ensure that babies who test positive for these conditions receive appropriate care. Finally, we would like to focus your attention on two programs, administered by the Health Resources and Services Administration, that improve access to health care for mothers and children. The Maternal and Child Health Block Grant compliments Medicaid and the Children's Health Insurance Program. It is no wonder we call it CHIP. That is easier to say. This program targets service to under-served populations. The foundation recommends funding at the authorized level of $850 million. Secondly, community health centers are an essential source of obstetric and pediatric care, and the foundation supports $175 million in new funds, to increase both the number of centers, and improve the scope of services offered. Thank you for allowing me to testify today. [The information follows:] [GRAPHIC(S) NOT AVAILABLE IN TIFF FORMAT] Mr. Regula. Was it the March of Dimes started to eradicate polio? Ms. Neal. It was. Mr. Regula. So you heard the success story of that? Ms. Neal. It is. In fact, our friend, Pat Sweeney, has always said, it should change its name from the March of Dimes to the March of Quarters, because of inflation. [Laughter.] Mr. Regula. Right, but it was a tremendous success story. Ms. Neal. Well, it is fascinating to listen to the doctor talk about eradication worldwide. I mean, it is in our lifetimes that this has happened. Mr. Regula. I believe he said that they vaccinated 107,000, I believe. Ms. Neal. Yes, at one time. Mr. Regula. No, that was million, 170 million. That is great progress to make those achievements. We hope we can have the same success with birth defects. Ms. Neal. One of the reasons that I have chosen to be a volunteer with March of Dimes for so many years is because they do accomplish a lot of real concrete success stories. Mr. Regula. Well, thank you for coming. Ms. Neal. Thank you. Mr. Regula. Next is Dr. Amy Lee, Assistant Professor of Community Medicine, from Northern Ohio. ---------- Wednesday, March 21, 2001. FRIENDS OF THE HEALTH RESOURCES AND SERVICES ADMINISTRATION WITNESS AMY LEE, MD, MPH, MBA, FRIENDS OF THE HEALTH RESOURCES AND SERVICES ADMINISTRATION Dr. Lee. Actually, besides your wonderful support to my academic institution, I have a brother who lives in Stark County, and my real estate agent works with your son, David, at Cutler GMA. That is my Ohio connection. Mr. Regula. My goodness. Dr. Lee. I am honored to be here today to testify on behalf of the Friends of the Health Resources and Services Administration or HRSA. The Friends of HRSA is an advocacy coalition of 125 national organizations, and it represents millions of public health and health care professionals, academicians such as myself, and consumers. HRSA programs assure that all Americans have access to basic health care services. In Ohio, in fact, three fourths of our public health funding comes from Federal sources, and HRSA plays a major role in this support. HRSA is a health safety net for nearly 43 million Americans, who lack health insurance; 49 million Americans who live in areas that have little access to primary health care services; and also African American babies who are 2.4 times more likely than their white counterparts to die before their first birthday. The Agency's overriding goal is to provide 100 percent access to health care, with zero disparities. The Friends of HRSA feel the Agency requires a funding level of at least $6.7 billion in order to achieve this goal. HRSA funding goes where the needs exists. Although programs are geared towards health care access, I would just like to highlight two programs, and mention several others. The first program is the new community access program. It allows communities to build partnerships among health care providers to deliver a broader range of health services to uninsured and under-served residents. Cincinnati actually received a CAP grant, and was one of the highest grant applications. This program coordinates some 50 organizations in this area through strategies to improve care, including the implementation of regional disease, management protocols for asthma, depression, diabetes and hypertension. The Friends are very concerned that the Administration's budget blueprint recommends eliminating this program of coordinated service delivery. This is an innovative program that is not duplicated anywhere else. The next program I would like to highlight is the health professions programs, which assure adequate national work force, despite projected nationwide shortages of nurses, pharmacists, and other professionals. Actually, Dr. Goldberg speak on behalf of this program, as well. Graduates of these programs are three to ten times more likely to practice in under-served areas. In addition, they are two to five times more likely to be minorities. The Friends are also concerned that cuts in these programs, which are proposed in the Administration's budget blueprint will impact this poorly. These programs provide up-front incentives for dozens of types of health professionals, not only physicians, but mental health, dentists, and also public health professionals, as well. Market forces will continue to drive shortages and mal- distribution in many of these sectors, potentially leaving health centers under-staffed, without the support of health professions programs. Also, it is clear for the need for other HRSA programs, as well. The Maternal and Child Health Block Grant provided funds for the Cleveland Healthy Start Program, and they saw a 40 percent in infant mortality, as a result. I really did not need to look any further than my local newspaper, the Akron Beacon Journal, to find other sources of need. On February 20th, the Akron Beacon Journal reported ``HIV stalks careless men.'' It reported that HIV is increasing in numbers in young people and heterosexuals. HRSA, next to Medicaid, provides the largest source of funding for AIDS programs, for low income and under-insured Americans. Over the weekend, actually, they ran a series of Ohioans spreading out, and blacks flee to suburbia. This told of folks who were going to suburban areas and rural areas to stay and to live there. Of course, there will be more need for programs such as the programs provided by HRSA to provide health care services. I would like to submit these three articles for the record, as well. Mr. Regula. Without objection. [The referenced articles follow:] [GRAPHIC(S) NOT AVAILABLE IN TIFF FORMAT] Dr. Lee. As you can see, HRSA programs are all about access to health care for Americans. We are really, because if we have a toothache or if we get sick, we know where to go, and we will get taken care of. For millions of these Americans, it is not that easy. I would like to close with a story from a HRSA-funded vision specialty clinic; actually from your district in Wayne County in Wooster. On one occasion, a four year old boy was taken in by one of the Head Start Clinic staff, because they thought he might have problems seeing. They found, on exam, that he was functionally blind. Because of the actions of the crack staff, this boy had glasses in three days. After he put the glasses on, the doctors said, he passed the smile test, because when they put the glasses on, the boy had a huge grin. For the next few days, the days said that he just looked at things and people that he had never really seen before, because he had these glasses, and due to the services of this HRSA specialty care clinic. I do not think it is by accident that we have heard a number of public witnesses here that have spoken on behalf of HRSA programs, because HRSA offers that link between the services and the people that need it the most. Thank you for this opportunity for me to speak on behalf of the Friends of HRSA. I welcome any questions. Mr. Regula. Well, do you, in your role as Professor of Community Medicine, work with the physicians in training there? Dr. Lee. I work with a few. Actually, I am mostly an Administrator. I direct the master public health program, which is a partnership program of five public institutions there. I am also involved in public health activities through the Ohio Public Health Association. I am President this year, as well. I am a little involved in the medical student training. Mr. Regula. But the public health programs would be delivered by physicians and/or nurses, I assume? Dr. Lee. Actually, the master public health program, it could be physicians, but also nurses, health care administrators, for them to better provide health care services to communities, as opposed to individuals. Mr. Regula. I assume the community health centers would be something where you would have a direct involvement. Dr. Lee. Actually, I sat on the board for the one in Akron, and because of a lot of other responsibilities, I had to give that up. But I was very much involved in that community health center for awhile. Mr. Regula. Are you using the new center up there, that you bring in people for lectures? Dr. Lee. Oh, that center has not been built, yet. Mr. Regula. You have not got it built? Dr. Lee. No, no, the ground has not been broken, yet. Mr. Regula. Oh, my. Dr. Lee. They are still making the plans. Mr. Regula. Well, at least you have the money. Dr. Lee. Yes, yes, thanks to you. [Laughter.] Mr. Regula. Okay, thank you for coming. Thank you for coming. Our witness is doctor James Pearsol. ---------- Wednesday, March 21, 2001. CENTER FOR DISEASE CONTROL AND PREVENTION (CDC) COALITION WITNESS JAMES A. PEARSOL, BA, MED, CHIEF, OFFICE OF POLICY AND LEADERSHIP, OHIO DEPARTMENT OF HEALTH Mr. Pearsol. Good afternoon, Mr. Chairman and Members of the Subcommittee. You may be a Cleveland Indians fan. If you are, then maybe you know Jimmy Person, who has quite a baseball player and quite a character. I am not a baseball player, but I probably qualify as a character. I am honored to be here today to testify on behalf of the CDC Coalition. The CDC Coalition is a nonpartisan association with more than 100 hundred groups committed to strengthening the Nation's prevention programs. Coalition members groups represent millions of public health workers, researchers, educators, and citizens served by CDC Coalition programs. I would like to welcome the Chairman into his new position. In addition, overseeing the funding for Public Health Service and to thank you for the work that you will do in the forthcoming year on this difficult bill. The CDC Coalition is the Nation's prevention agency that is putting health research into practice. Public health prevention is about two things. The what of health prevention is preventing adverse health outcomes and the how are the tools of the trades including programs, surveillance, and best practices. Prevention translates into lives saved and pain and suffering avoided, health costs avoided, quality of life improved, use of best health practices, and use of credible health information. In the best professional judgement of the CDC Coalition, CDC will require funding of a least $5 billion to adequately fulfill its mission for fiscal year 2002. Mr. Regula. Do you work directly with CDC? Mr. Pearsol. Yes. We receive, again, probably $40 million of our budget, part of the three-fourths of Federal funding at the Ohio Department of Health, and pass that on in large measure to local health and community departments. Mr. Regula. The funding is channeled through CDC. Mr. Pearsol. Correct. Mr. Regula. The Federal portion. Mr. Pearsol. That is correct. Mr. Regula. You in turn work with local public health agencies in the communities around Ohio. Mr. Pearsol. That is correct. Mr. Regula. The State County Board of Health would be working directly with to you. Mr. Pearsol. I work directly for them, Bill Franks and his Board, the city, Bob Patteson, and Mayor Watkins. Mr. Regula. Go ahead. Mr. Pearsol. Thank you. Health prevention is like auto maintenance. It is not appreciated until it fails. It is not much fun when it fails. In any maintenance of prevention ignored is guaranteed to lead to failure. CDC makes Public Works in Ohio, and I will give you some examples. Chronic diseases are Ohio's quiet killer. Five diseases account for 70 percent of Ohio's deaths. In fact, heart disease, 91 deaths each day, cancer, 68 deaths each day, stroke, 18 deaths each day, lung disease, 15 deaths each day, and diabetes, nine deaths each day. The CDC Center for Chronic Disease Prevention and Health Promotion supports programs that combat this chronic set of diseases. The impact on the elderly is profound and about 80 percent of seniors have at least one chronic condition and 50 percent have two or more. We know that breast and cervical cancer, prostate, lung, and colon rectal cancers can be avoided through early detection. The CDC supports programs like these and other chronic illness such as diabetes. Nearly 16 million Americans have diabetes and the largest increases are among adults 30 to 39 in age. CDC supports state and territorial diabetes control programs that attack this problem. Health disparities persist in all of these disease that I talk about in Ohio. This CDC's REACH program that is racial and ethnic approaches to community health address serious disparities and infant mortality, breast and cervical cancer, HIV and AIDS, etc. In Ohio, infant mortality rates for African American are twice those of whites. One of Ohio's Public Health Service success stories is childhood immunizations. In 1994, only about half of our two year old had been immunized by 2001 and 78 percent had been immunized, which is a 55 percent increase. This was possible through the availability of low cost vaccine from CDC. Injuries and their prevention is crucial. Each day an average of 9,000 U.S. workers sustained disabling injuries, 17 died from work related injuries, and 137 died from work related illnesses. Finally, the preventive help block grant is the key to flexible funding at the local level were local program can match solutions to demand in the local community. The how of CDC is cease surveillance. This is a lot like an air traffic control system. It is the disease tracking control system. It is a basic monitoring system that detects early warning signs. The National Electronic Disease surveillance system created Ohio's early warning system for disease outbreaks. The Epidemic Intelligence Service Officer Corps has supported many outbreak investigations in Ohio and including TB outbreak in Columbus, Typhoid outbreak in Cincinnati, Listeria in northwest Ohio; part of a National outbreak, Cryptosporidiosis in a Delaware county swimming pool, and E. coli in Medina county fair grounds water system. In terms of capacities and skills, the CDC Coalition supports full funding for the provisions authorized in the Pubic Health threat emergency act sponsored by representative Burns Stewpack. This concluded my prepared remarks. I would be happy to answer any questions. [The justification follows:] [GRAPHIC(S) NOT AVAILABLE IN TIFF FORMAT] Mr. Regula. Do you work any with the schools as part of an education program for preventive medicine? Mr. Pearsol. Yes. We work directly school program with nursing staff and the Public Health teachers. In order to get the message to the community. Mr. Regula. There are a lot of gains that could be made in preventive medicine to achieve good health, that is to develop programs of preventive medicine to alert people. Mr. Pearsol. Yes, that is right. We believe this is the key. Ohioans smoke more are more obese, exercise less, and eat fewer fruits and vegetables. Those are behaviors that can change the kinds of chronic diseases that I am mentioned that kill Ohioans and others in Americans in this country. Mr. Regula. Is it an education process? Mr. Pearsol. Yes, education is part of the process. It is changing the behaviors and repeating the message. Mr. Regula. Thank you. Mr. Pearsol. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. Mr. Regula. Our next witness is Gerald Slavet. Ms. Hurley-Wales. It is Slavet. Mr. Regula. I am intrigued by ``From the Top.'' Is that Ringling Brothers? Mr. Hurley-Wales. No, it is a radio program. Mr. Regula. Oh, where is it? Mr. Hurley-Wales. Actually, in your area, it is on WCLV in Cleveland. Mr. Regula. What kind of a program is it? Mr. Hurley-Wales. Well, I am happy to answer that. Mr. Regula. I guess you are going to tell us. Mr. Hurley-Wales. Right, I will tell you all about it. Mr. Regula. Okay. ---------- Wednesday, March 21, 2001. GERALD SLAVET EDUCATION PERFORMANCES FOUNDATION WITNESS JENNIFER HURLEY-WALES, EXECUTIVE VICE PRESIDENT, GERALD SLAVET EDUCATION PERFORMANCES FOUNDATION Ms. Hurley-Wales. My name is Jennifer Hurley-Wales. I am here to testify on behalf of Gerald Slavet of the Education Performances Foundation. Gerald is out of the country today. We were very appreciative to have this opportunity to appear before you and the Subcommittee. I am the Executive Vice President of our foundation and co- founder of our flagship project ``From the Top.'' Since its launch in 1998, ``From the Top'' radio program has brought into the foreground the exceptional achievements of pre-collegiality classical musicians. It helped build the self esteem of the young participants, and provided role models for 100 to 1,000 young people across the United States. The mission of ``From the Top'' is to celebrate and encourage the development of youth through music. The project is designed to demystify classical music making it more accessible to young audiences and adults. ``From the Top'' believes that young people that can play Mozart's Clarinet Concerto are just as cool as those who dunk basketballs. We know those who play that kind of music are usually strong students and that is why we celebrate young classical musicians in the same way that their athletic schoolmates are-- as heroes. Early involvement with classical music plays a key role in the development of children's intellects, which is important for the new economy that relies on math, science, and analytical skills. We believe that ``From the Top's'' is entertaining and accessible and national radio program will lead to a public conversation at the grass roots level. Perhaps this will help influence public opinion and policy about the value of arts education. ``From the Top's'' weekly radio series taped before a live audience, features America's most exceptional 9- to 18-year-old classical musicians and performance and interviews. Now broadcast on 215 station nationwide, the show has a projected listenership of 700,000 people each week. A passionate listenership I should say as demonstrated by the daily flood of positive e-mails we continue to receive. Mr. Regula. Do you go nationwide? Ms. Hurley-Wales. We are on 215 stations nationwide. Mr. Regula. Produced in Cleveland? Ms. Hurley-Wales. It was produced in Boston. Mr. Regula. OK. Ms. Hurley-Wales. ``From the Top'' is considered today the most listened to classical music program on public radio. Tapings take place before family audiences in Boston at New England Conservatory's Jordan Hall and in halls across the country including Carnegie Hall in New York and the Kennedy Center in Washington. In fact, we will be here next week. The extraordinary popularity and success of ``From the Top'' radio series has led to the creation of three additional components. ``From the Top'' television specials are in development for production for PBS. They will feature host Christopher O'Riley, performances and documentary style profiles of five exceptional young musicians and ensembles. ``From the Top.org'' is the only site on the Internet that provides a complete suite of services and community for young people who are passionate about music. The site is an interactive forum for kids, teachers, and parents to discuss, present, and research all matters that relate to music. ``From the Top's'' newest initiative, Sound Waves education project addresses the urgent need to bring cultural missionaries into our communities through curricular materials linked to the radio shows, teacher training workshops, and cultural leadership training for young musicians. This Sound Wave project builds on ``From the Top's'' greatest asset and the power of the young performer as a role model for other kids. Thanks to the interest and leadership of Congressman Joe Moakley, and the support of this Subcommittee, our foundation has received funding from the U.S. Department of Education in the past, including a $510,000 grant for this fiscal year. ``From the Top'' would not be in existence without the U.S. DOE funding. Please know that we are aware of the importance in improving our funding and we mounted a comprehensive development effort to that effect. We appreciate the support of this Subcommittee and we now respectfully request that you extend your commitment to young people and the arts by providing a $1.25 million grant to Education Performances Foundation to continue support for this innovative program. This grant would allow us to further develop and implement our cultural leadership training and expand the reach of educational efforts through school, community, and Internet- based programs. Your continued support would allow the overwhelmingly positive impact of ``From the Top'' to continue and multiply for the greater mission of our project to be reached. Thank you. [The justification follows:] [GRAPHIC(S) NOT AVAILABLE IN TIFF FORMAT] Mr. Regula. Thank you. I thought that I left the arts when I left Interior. The next witness is Joseph E. Pizzorno, President Emeritus of Bastyr University in Seattle, Washington. ---------- Wednesday, March 21, 2001. BASTYR UNIVERSITY WITNESS JOSEPH E. PIZZORNO, JR., PRESIDENT EMERITUS, BASTYR UNIVERSITY IN SEATTLE, WASHINGTON Mr. Regula. Do you know my friend Sled Gordon? Mr. Pizzorno. Actually, I have talked to him several times. Mr. Regula. We worked together on Interior matters. Mr. Pizzorno. Great. You said Washington like a true native. You must have spent some time with him. Mr. Regula. We spent quite a bit of time together. He was Chairman and I was Chairman of house, parks, and forests. We also took care of the flagship in your part of the world. You are in Seattle. Mr. Pizzorno. Yes. Mr. Regula. OK. We look forward from hearing from you. Mr. Pizzorno. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. My name is Joseph Pizzorno. I am a licensed naturopathic physician in the state of Washington. I am also the founding President of Bastyr University. The first fully credited institution of natural medicine in the United States. I am also a member of the Seattle County Board of Health. The Chair of special interest groups on Alternative Medicine for the American Public Health Association. I have also been appointed to the White House Commission on Complementary and Alternative Medicine Policy. This was created by Congress to advise Congress on how to integrate natural medicine into the health care system. While I am very active in several of these organizations, and have 25 years of leadership in natural medicine, education, research, and health policy innovation, I am not here representing any particular organization. I am here because I believe that the most pervasive and silently accepted crisis in America today is ill health of our people. We have a health care system that is oriented towards disease treatment and symptom relief, but does relative little to actually restoring and promoting people's health. Every decade, for the past 50 years, the incidence of chronic and degenerative disease has increased in virtually every age group in the past 50 years. The message that I am presenting to you today is somewhat different from the message you have heard earlier today. Our current health care system is excellent in many ways, such as acute conditions and emergency care, but it is not particularly effective in restoring and promoting health. Health promotion is the area in which natural medicine is most effective. My written testimony addresses several areas and defines: What is Complementary in Alternative Medicine? How popular is CAM? Why is it important in heath care? Who are the CAM professionals? What state of the research in CAM? What are the critical issues that determine if the full benefits of CAM will be experienced by the American people. Finally, I present specific recommendations to the Subcommittee. What is CAM? It is something that is know by many names. Natural medicine, alternative medicine, integrative medicine, and complementary medicine. It seems that our government is now calling it CAM. I will use CAM in my further address. When many people think about CAM, they think about it as simply substituting natural therapies for drugs and surgery. That is not what natural medicine is about. It is about philosophical approach to heath care fundamentally difference from that of the conventional medicine. It is about health promotion rather than disease treatment, about correcting the underlying causes of ill health rather than system relief. It is about improvement in function rather than waiting for end stage pathology that requires heroic intervention. It is about education, healthy lifestyles, self care, and natural health products rather than dependence on medical doctors. It is about supporting the body's own healing processes rather than turning to drugs to support or replace by systems. It is about a powerful belief in the inherent ability of the body to heal if just given a chance. These concepts of healing change the way in which we think about and provide health care. Why are these concepts important to health care? Americans are experiencing unpresitant burden of ill health and disease worsening disease trends, appallingly high incidence of treatment side effects and out of control health care costs. There are a lot of statistic in my written testimony. Of the 191 countries that maintain health statistics, the United States rant seventy second in health status according to the World Heath Organization. According to Christopher Muray, M.D., Director of WHO's Global Program on Evidence for Health Policy. Basically, you die earlier and spend more time disabled if you are an American rather than a member of most advanced countries. One of the key differences between health care in the United States and most of the rest of the world, especially those ranking higher in health statistics, is significantly higher healthier life styles and in several countries such as number two ranked Australia, and much greater use of CAM in natural health care products. In fact, in both European countries, ranking above the United States in health care statistics, the lead prescription drugs are herbal medicines and not synthetic chemicals. CAM is most effective precisely in those area weakest in conventional medicine. How popular is CAM? 42 percent of Americans now seek the services of natural medicine practitioners. There were 629 million visits in natural medicine practitioners in 1997, which was more than primary medical doctors for primary care. What can I recommend to this committee? Currently, the primary mechanism for Federal funding in CAM research is through the NIH National Center for CAM research. It receives less than one percent of the NIH total budget and that is inadequate to meet the need of the mission. The state of CAM research is widely misunderstood. It is easily dismissed as having no evidence. In fact, there is tremendous amount of evidence supporting the natural medicine. The textbook of natural medicine 10,000 citations of peer review scientific literature documenting the authenticity of these kinds of interventions. I would like to leave you with one recommendation. We have experience tremendous benefits in our country form having invest a lot of resources in conventional medicine research. We have invested less than one half of one percent in research into natural medicine. I believe that we can experience the same kind of benefits if we engage in more natural medicine and reap the benefits of the centuries long traditions of healing. Thank you. [The justification follows:] [GRAPHIC(S) NOT AVAILABLE IN TIFF FORMAT] Mr. Regula. Thank you. Mr. Peterson must be delayed arriving. I take one more and hopefully he will get here. Mr. Akhter. I have a meeting with the Secretary of Education. If you can cut it short, that would be helpful. ---------- Wednesday, March 21, 2001. AMERICAN PUBLIC HEALTH ASSOCIATION WITNESS MOHAMMAD AKHTER, EXECUTIVE DIRECTOR, AMERICAN PUBLIC HEALTH ASSOCIATION Mr. Akhter. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. My name is Mohammad Akhter. I am the Executive Director of the American Public Health Association. We have 55,000 members and they are primary concerned with the health of the American people. I am not here to testify and support particular agency, particular program or special group of people, but just the American people. Mr. Regula. You have heard the testimony. Will your testimony be similar to what we have heard. Mr Akhter. No. It is very specific. Let me point out to you three or four areas we think the major emphasis should be really help the American people be healthy and happier for the future. First, there are health disparities among our Americans. We have made tremendous progress in life expectancy, immunization, and other arenas. I have been health commissioner in Washington, DC. I have been state health director for the state of Missouri. We have done wonderful work. However, some of minority do not enjoy the same health status. The number of minorities is increasing. By 2050, there will be 50 percent of all people of racial ethnic descent. We cannot have a strong Nation if some of our people our suffering this disproportionately from heart disease and cancer. For example, the infant mortality rate is twice as high for the African American than it is for the average American. Similarly, the death rate from the diabetes is twice as high for Hispanics as it is for rest of the country. Last year, Congress passed a bill and created a center in the NIH for minority health. Mr. Chairman, we respectfully request that the center be fully funded so it can get its work going. In addition, we are asking that you fund the agency for health care research and quality so that research can be taken to the people at large to be able to help people. Secondly, Mr. Chairman, these were the issues that are very near and dear to most Americans. The second most important problem among our communities is the substance abuse problem. Many of the social and public health problems have root cause is the substance abuse. President has put some additional money in the budget for substance abuse treatment. We hope that the Subcommittee will look at this carefully. We will push that forward. The third area is our seniors. 80 percent of them have one chronic condition and 50 percent have two or more. They become utterly disabled and have to go to nursing home or need more medical care. HCFA has started a new program were they have combined the company assessment with health promotion disease prevention and treatment. We can keep people healthier in their own homes. Not only improve theirquality of life, but also save some money. Finally, Mr. Chairman, last year, the Congress passes a bill to deal with the bad terrorism to repair our Nation. The responsibility for this was placed in the Center for Disease Control in Atlanta. It is a problem today, as it was last year. We need to fund that completely so that we can have our communities prepared and our people protected. Lastly, Mr. Chairman, like the economy, disease is also become global. Now the hoof mouth disease. A disease can come at any time. We have the best scientist in the world. We need to make them available to other countries so that they can contain the disease at a local level. The Office of International Health, CDC, NIH where they have these experts, that those programs be funded so that the programs can be available to other countries so we do need to fight the diseases once its inside of our borders. Mr. Chairman, I appreciate very much the opportunity to testify before you. I would be glad to answer any questions. [The justification follows:] [GRAPHIC(S) NOT AVAILABLE IN TIFF FORMAT] Mr. Regula. Thank you for your testimony. You are absolutely right. Announce prevention. It is worth a pound of cures, they always say. Thank you for being here. Our next witness is Marianne Comegys. I appreciate the patients of all of you. Somebody has to be last. Francine makes out the list so do not hold me responsible. [Laughter.] ---------- Wednesday, March 21, 2001. MEDICAL LIBRARY ASSOCIATION AND THE ASSOCIATION OF ACADEMIC HEALTH SCIENCES LIBRARIES WITNESS MARIANNE COMEGYS, CHAIR, MLA GOVERNMENT RELATIONS COMMITTEE, MEDICAL LIBRARY ASSOCIATION AND THE ASSOCIATION OF ACADEMIC HEALTH SCIENCES LIBRARIES Ms. Comegys. I am Marianne Comegys, Associate Professor at Louisiana State University Health Science Library in Shreveport, Louisiana. I am pleased to testify on behalf of the Medical Library Association and the Association of Academic Health Sciences Libraries regarding fiscal year 2002 budget for the National Library of Medicine. MLA is a professional organization representing 1200 institutions and 4,000 individuals involved in the management and dissemination of biomedical information. AAHSI is compromised of the directors of libraries of 142 accredited U.S. and Canadian medical schools. The NLM is the world's largest medical library with 5.8 million items through National network of regional libraries. MLM ensures that health professionals and the public have access to health prevention and treatment. Mr. Regula. OK. You have sold me. Where do you get your funding? What does it come through. Ms. Comegys. It comes through NIH. The NLM is one of the agencies within NIH. Mr. Regula. Your effort would be to get more funding for NIH. Ms. Comegys. Right, through the NLM. Mr. Regula. So that can give you more money. Ms. Comegys. Specifically, to the NLM as well. Mr. Regula. You would like that to be mentioned in the report. Ms. Comegys. Right. Mr. Regula. I got the message. You will have to wrap up in a minute or two. Ms. Comegys. Okay, I will. I will mention that recognizing the invaluable role that NLM plays in our health care delivery system, NLM also joins with ad hoc for medical research funding, and recommends a 16.5 percent increase for NLM in the NIH in fiscal year 2002. Many of our programs today, that the other witnesses have testified to, and one of the important issues that I will just sort of mention and sort of just regard this today since you are in a hurry, is that we provide, as the medical library community, the information resources necessary for those. Mr. Regula. Who uses your services, doctors? Ms. Comegys. The public, the health care physicians, and right now, there is a big push for consumer health. Mr. Regula. Well, if I wanted to use your services as a layman, where would I go? Ms. Comegys. You can go now to the public libraries; you can go to the medical libraries. But what we are doing now and what the National Library of Medicine has done is emphasize the consumer, and what wehave provided for you, Mr. Chairman, is easy access to this information through user-friendly databases. Mr. Regula. Here comes my pinch hitters. Now you have go lots of time. [Laughter.] Mr. Peterson [assuming chair]. He said you had lots of time, so take it. Ms. Comegys. Well, okay, I will start over. Do I still have that five minutes? On behalf of the Medical Library Community, I thank the subcommittee for the leadership in securing a 15 percent increase for NLM in fiscal year 2001. With respect to the library's budget for next year, I will address four issues: NLM's basic services outreach and telemedicine activities, PUBMED Central and the clinical trials database, and a need for a new library building. It is a tribute to NLML that the demand for its services continues to steadily increase each year. There are more than 250 million Internet searches annually on the Medicine database. Mr. Chairman, NLM is a national treasure. I can tell you that without NLM, our Nation's medical libraries would be unable to provide the type of information services that our Nation's health care providers, educators, researchers, and patients have come to expect. NLM's outreach programs are designed to educate medical librarians, health care professionals and the public about NLM services. The need for enhanced outreach activities has grown in recent years, following the library's decision to provide free access to its Medicine databases. Mr. Chairman, we applaud the success of NLM's outreach initiatives, and look forward to continuing our work with them on these important programs. Telemedicine also continues to hold great promise for dramatically increasing the delivery of health care to under-served communities. NLM has sponsored over 50 telemedicine related projects in recent years. Introduced in 2000, PUBMED Central is an on-line collection of live science articles, which evolved from an electronic publishing concept, initially proposed by former NIH director, Dr. Harold Varmus. This new on-line resource will significantly increase access to biomedical information, and we encourage the subcommittee to continue to support its development. I also want to comment on a new NLM service. It is the clinical trials database. This service is free, and it logs more than two million hits a month. It is an invaluable resource, which lists 5,000 Federal and privately-funded trials for serious or life-threatening diseases. In order for NLM to continue its mission, a few facility is urgently needed. Over the past two decades, the library has assumed several new responsibilities, particularly in the areas of biotechnology, high performance computing, and consumer health. As a result, the library has had tremendous growth in its basic functions. An increase in the volume of biomedical information, as well as library personnel, has resulted in a serious shortage of library space. The medical library community is pleased that Congress last year appropriated the necessary architectural and engineering funds for facility expansion at NLM. We encourage the subcommittee to continue to provide the resources necessary to acquire a new facility, and to support the library's information programs. Thank you for the opportunity to present the view of the medical library community. [The justification follows:] [GRAPHIC(S) NOT AVAILABLE IN TIFF FORMAT] Mr. Peterson. Who all has access to the library. Ms. Comegys. To the databases of the libraries? Mr. Peterson. Yes. Ms. Comegys. Everyone, from the physician to the researcher to the consumer; and one of the pushes that the National Library of Medicine has had for the last few years, and it has actually come the demand of the consumer, is that they know more about themselves and their health, and where to find this type of information. So Medline, which is a database of references and articles, now is free, on the web. It is easily accessible amd the user- friendly version is called Medline-Plus. Mr. Peterson. Medline-Plus.com? Ms. Comegys. Well, Medline-Plus is actually through NIH NLM, and then I think Medline-Plus is a database that lists 450 different health topics. Within that database, there is also dictionaries. There are consumer health links to other information on specific diseases. There is drug information. There is information on physicians within each territory. There is also, as I mentioned, the clinical trials database, and that is also quite accessible for anyone. So you, as a patient, or you, as a family member of someone who has a serious or life threatening disease, could go in, look on the clinical trials database, which is on theweb, which is free, and see which clinical trials are available right now, which are those that will be available. Then you, as an informed patient now, or informed family member, can go to your physician and say, you know, this is something that I think I would be interested in and want to participate in. It gives you all of the criteria listed, as well. So one of the pushes for NLM is the consumer and the consumer health, along with the human genome project which, of course, is for the researcher, and it is that enormous DNA data sequencing information, of course, which all the researchers in the U.S. and worldwide are so excited about. So we are from the researcher, as well as to the consumer. Mr. Peterson. If I was to inform my constituents on how they could utilize this, what should I tell them? Ms. Comegys. You can actually tell them, in Pennsylvania, they can go to their public libraries and have access to it. You can actually tell them to look on the Internet, just to search at home under National Library of Medicine. Within that website, it gives you all of the databases that I have described, plus others that they can have access to, free of charge. I can get you the website information. That is something that more and more people utilize, the Med-line databases. As I mentioned in my report, I think it mentioned so many million hits. Thirty percent of that is actually from the public, and that is probably increasing every day. Mr. Peterson. The rest is doctors, hospitals. Ms. Comegys. Researchers, health care professionals, and medical students. Mr. Peterson. If you could give us a short paper on that. Ms. Comegys. I will do that. Mr. Peterson. We may bog down the system. Ms. Comegys. Well, that is great. Do you know, the National Library of Medicine has sort of looked at those statistics, and they have never been down. They have continued to keep the web site. That is good, because they were actually surprised at the increase that has come about from that database. That is why they have gone to more and more of the consumer-based database. We, in the medical library community, work with the National Library of Medicine, through regional medical libraries. We go out, through grants from NLM, and train the public librarians on how to search for this information. We train the health care professionals on how to search it. We have grants to train the public health professionals on how to search, and how to help the patient, so that it is not just the patient out there, trying to search it with not as much knowledge as maybe they needed. But actually, it is quite user friendly. You could get on there today, and find out all sorts of information. Mr. Peterson. I shall do that. Ms. Comegys. The other thing is that I want to mention that, it is an accurate up to date databases. One of the concerns is that I think is with all the medical literature out there on the web. How accurate, reliable or up to date is the information. When you come to our databases, that is what you are getting is good information. Mr. Peterson. I wonder if real physicians use that often. Ms. Comegys. Yes, that is one of the other projects within the outreach projects with the NLM. Many of the grants are given to the regional medical library groups. There are eight regional library groups and through those groups, the grants are distributed to the local areas. The push for the rural and the medically undeserved areas. Telemedicine also comes in now to also help within those areas. Those in those areas that are medically undeserved have no less health information than those in the large cities. This is real important to us as well. Mr. Peterson. How does your telemedicine project work? Ms. Comegys. They all work quite differently. You can have telemedicine where it is the consultation from a small town physician who is sending visual images. We can do this now because of the technology. The high bandwidth and the wheel time video imaging that is available to us now. Small town physician can actually send these visuals images to the specialist in the larger city. The specialist in the large city can work on diagnosis and treatment. The patient would not have to travel to that large facility and that city. On a personal level right now in Louisiana at the Louisiana State University, we have a telemedicine program that we are working with the prisoners at a correctional institution in Louisiana. Our physicians at LSU are looking at information at the prison for those physicians there and then we are diagnosing and sending treatment information back to them so that they do not have to transport those prisoners to Shreveport or any other major facility. It can be used whether is it consultations with the physician and a patient. There is a lot of home health telemedicine projects. You can use it for continuing education with the physician and the student, who many of our students are in rural areas in Louisiana. Louisiana has a lot of rural areas. The patient themselves sort through some telemedicine projects and having access to the electronic resources. Mr. Peterson. Thank you very much. Ms. Comegys. Thank you. Thursday, March 22, 2001. MEMBER OF CONGRESS WITNESS HON. LOUIS STOKES, A REPRESENTATIVE IN CONGRESS FROM THE STATE OF OHIO Mr. Regula. We'll get started. I see we have many interested people again. I think it's great that you're here. A lot of you are going to a lot of trouble to be here to testify for your cause, and that's what this country's all about. I know that it's time and money that you have to do, but you're not only helping your cause, you're helping a lot of others who are going to follow along. Really, it's a very generous thing for each of you to come and bring to our attention the importance of something that's close to your heart. This Committee does have a lot of challenges, obviously. This is our sixth day of public witnesses. We have the former chairman of this Committee with us this morning, Mr. Lou Stokes from Cleveland. How many years did you chair this, Lou? Mr. Stokes. About as long as the committee, Mr. Chairman, 24 years. Mr. Regula. Twenty-four years. I need you as a consultant. I've been on it for about 24 days. Mr. Stokes. You'll do fine, Mr. Chairman. Mr. Regula. Lou's out practicing law in Cleveland, Ohio. He did a lot of good things, not only here, but the other committees, and we're happy that you're here today. Just a few of the rules. We have the boxes here which are timekeepers. I hate to do it, but we have to. We have about 28 today, and we've had 28 most every--this is the sixth day. I think it's indicative of the great interest that the public has in this Committee, is the fact that we've had so many, and then on top of that, we had to have a lottery to decide who would get to be even a public witness, because the requests are far more than we can accommodate. But it's great that you bring these things to our attention. The boxes will be green and then it goes to amber, which means you've got a minute to wrap up, and then the red light goes on and the buzzer. So we regret it has to be that way, but we'll do the best we can to get all the evidence in. I see Nancy has arrived. Would you like to introduce your former Chairman? Mrs. Pelosi. It would be an honor. Mr. Regula. Okay. I don't know whether to call you Chairman or former Congressman or lawyer. You have a selection of titles, Lou, but I like to call you best of all friend. That's the one I like. Mr. Stokes. And that's something that means a great deal to me, Mr. Chairman, the friendship that you and I share, and the friendship you shared also with my late brother, Carl, with whom you served in Ohio. Mr. Regula. That's right. Lou's brother Carl was the first African American mayor of a major city in the United States, he was mayor of Cleveland. I sat beside him in the State House of Representatives, and we became very good friends. In fact, he endorsed me. [Laughter.] And he's a Democrat in Canton District. So see, Steny, there's an opportunity for you. [Laughter.] Mr. Hoyer. You never can tell. Mr. Regula. I think, Nancy, you came close once. You were out there, weren't you, at that meeting? Mrs. Pelosi. Yes, Mr. Chairman, I remember it well. And so do you. [Laughter.] Mr. Regula. Okay, well, Mrs. Pelosi, will you introduce our first witness this morning? Mrs. Pelosi. Mr. Chairman, this is a very great honor, as I know that any one of my colleagues would attest to. As you indicated in your opening remarks, this is almost a family affair for all of us, for Steny, for Jesse, because when Lou comes to the Committee, he not only comes personally, but he brings a great tradition with him. You talked about Carl, and I have my connection, too, my brother, Thomas D'Alessandro was a very close friend of Carl. They were both mayors in that very difficult time in our country's history, both young mayors. And they had a very, very close personal bond. I always used to say to Lou when I came here, I one day would love to meet your mother, she has to be the greatest mom in the world to have produced two great sons. Now the courthouse is--is it this Saturday? Mr. Stokes. It was this past Sunday. Mrs. Pelosi. This past Sunday, it was dedicated in Ohio in honor of her in her name. So with all of that personal and political history, I'm pleased to welcome our former colleague, Lou Stokes, behind whom and under whose leadership it was a pleasure to serve here and in other committees in the Congress. Congressman served in the Congress for 30 years, my friends, for those younger people here who don't know, 30 years, 1969 to 1999. He spent many of those years as a member of this Subcommittee. He's currently senior counsel of the law firm Squire, Saunders and Dempsey, and is a member of the faculty of Case Western Reserve University, senior visiting scholar at the Mandel School of Applied Social Sciences. Congressman Stokes is also a member of the board of advisors for the Trust for America's Health, which brings him here today. He will describe what it is, so I won't take any time to do that. But Congressman Stokes and the Trust for America's Health have shown great leadership in the effort to improve our Nation's response to environmental health hazards. As Iwelcome him, I want to say that in welcoming Lou Stokes to this Committee, I am welcoming the best that America has to offer. Our chairman, Mr. Stokes. Mr. Hoyer. Mr. Chairman? Mr. Regula. Mr. Hoyer. Mr. Hoyer. Thank you. I want to join Nancy's remarks. Before you got here, Nancy, I indicated to our audience that I had the great privilege and honor of sitting next to Lou for many years as he served on this Committee. He and his brother and family have been giants on behalf of so many different issues. But clearly, every young African American child in America can have an extraordinary role model in Lou Stokes. As I sat next to him, as you know, Mr. Chairman, you didn't serve on this Committee, so you didn't have the privilege of seeing him, but whether it's the historically black colleges dealing with higher education, or it was in TRIO, or it was in primary and secondary education programs, or whether it was dealing with employees at NIH who were aspiring to be treated on the basis of their character, their talent and their contribution rather than the color of their skin, Lou Stokes has been and continues to be a giant on behalf of all Americans. I want to join Nancy in welcoming him to this Committee. His leadership was a powerful, it was a quiet leadership, a leadership of conscience and of character, not of bluster and power, which made it even more powerful because of that. And Lou, all of us who know you are honored to be your friend and honored to have served with you. I join Nancy and Ralph and Jesse in welcoming you to the Committee. Mr. Regula. Mr. Jackson. Mr. Jackson. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. Let me just say that we run the danger this morning with all of the accolades that we could bestow upon Mr. Stokes, of the kind things that all of us who have had the opportunity to work with him, who have witnessed him from afar, and those of us who for the very brief tenures that we've been in the institution have had the great opportunity and privilege of working with Mr. Stokes, we run the danger this morning of our accolades being much longer than your testimony. [Laughter.] When I first came to this Committee, I came really as the successor to Lou Stokes. Many of the programs that I champion and argue for on this Committee were programs that Lou Stokes one, authored as a member of this institution, shepherded the legislation through the process, and then, on this Committee, fought to make sure that those programs were fully funded. The outstanding work that his family has done, his brother as mayor of Cleveland, the Congressman himself here in the United States institution, there are very few people who have earned the respect of both sides of the aisle like Congressman Lou Stokes. I remember when he announced his retirement, and many of us went to the Floor essentially to say goodbye to Mr. Stokes, the outpouring from both sides of the aisle was nothing less than astounding. I've seen other members of Congress who served the same amount of time in the institution, and literally within 15 or 20 minutes, whatever accolades were being bestowed upon them, essentially the special order was essentially over. We could have spent the entire day, maybe even the entire week, talking about the contributions that Lou Stokes has made to this Nation. I'm indeed honored that you're before our Committee, and I'm equally as honored to have the great privilege of trying my very best to follow in my footsteps on the Committee. I'm very grateful, Mr. Stokes. Mr. Stokes. Thank you. Mrs. Pelosi. This isn't about Mr. Stokes' contribution to this Committee, but it's important to note that he was the chair of the Ethics Committee, he was the chair of the Intelligence Committee, and all that that implies in terms of the changes. As the Ranking on Intelligence now, I can speak to all that he has done to, as far as diversity is concerned in that community as well. He has pioneered so many fronts, he's the all American boy. We could again take all day to talk about him. Mr. Jackson. I believe he was also lead investigator on the assassination of Martin Luther King, Jr., lead investigator on the assassination of John F. Kennedy, as well. So for those of you who are here, it's really a great privilege and a great honor for those are here and are very unfamiliar with our Committee to be in the presence of Mr. Stokes. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. Mr. Regula. Well, it's not only that, you go to Cleveland, every other street is a Stokes Boulevard. [Laughter.] And the Stokes VA clinic, and I don't know, is there anything left to name up there? Between you and Carl and your mother, I guess you skipped the Terminal Tower. But you've done well. Lou, we're happy to welcome you. Mr. Stokes. Mr. Chairman and Mr. Hoyer, Mrs. Pelosi and Mr. Jackson, I'm indeed overwhelmed. Mr. Regula. And we have a new member down here, Mr. Sherwood. Mr. Stokes. Mr. Sherwood. Mr. Regula. He's the newest member of our Subcommittee. Mr. Stokes. Greetings, Mr. Sherwood. Obviously I'm overwhelmed, your kindness and your kind remarks this morning have indeed overwhelmed me. It's difficult to even say to you what it meant to walk back into this room where I spent 24 of the 30 years that I served on the Appropriations Committee. It is a part of my life, and I suppose will always remain a part of my life, as will the personal friendships I had with each one of you. We've spoken, Mr. Chairman, of the great friendship you had, not only with me but with my brother, Carl, with whom you served. And Mr. Hoyer, I remember even you were out in Ohio when my daughter was running for judgeship out there, and you shared that experience with us. She's still on the bench, and enjoying it, thanks to you and others. Mrs. Pelosi, as you mentioned, your brother and my brother were mayors at the same time, and they were great friends. You enjoyed a special relationship also with my brother Carl. And Mr. Jackson, in your case, your father, Rev. Jesse Jackson, was highly instrumental when Dr. King came to Cleveland and walked the streets of Cleveland, to register voters in a way that they were able to elect Carl Stokes as mayor of Cleveland and set history. Your father was one of the young lieutenants that Dr. King brought with him. And your father over the years was a part of everything that Carl and I did in that city. It was a great honor for me to counsel with you about the fact that when I was leaving here, that this would be a great subcommittee for you to get on. I hear such wonderful things about what you're doing in terms of carrying on the work that I endeavored to do over the years. Mr. Chairman, I'm indeed honored to be here this morning. Mr. Chairman and members of the subcommittee, I'm currently serving on the board of a new public health organization called the Trust for America's Health. A former chairman of this Committee, John Porter, and Governor Lowell Weicker are also on this board. The Trust's mission is to put prevention back into the fight against chronic diseases. I serve on the Pew Environmental and Health Commission, located at Johns Hopkins Hospital. Based on the Commission's recommendation, the Trust's first initiative is to fight for the creation of a nationwide health tracking network to track chronic diseases. Today, chronic diseases such as cancer, asthma, leukemia, birth defects and Parkinsons kill four out of five Americans. More than a third of our population, 100 million women, children and men suffer from chronic diseases. These diseases annually cost our country $325 billion. Yet there is no national system to track these killer diseases. Our Federal and State agencies only coordinate tracking infectious diseases: polio, typhoid and yellow fever, diseases that a national tracking system helped to eradicate. Chairman Regula, let me give you some examples from our home State of Ohio. Even though asthma attacks are the number one cause of school absenteeism, and asthma has increased 75 percent between 1980 and 1994, Ohio does not track this disease. Ohio does not track cerebral palsy, autism and mental retardation, even though the National Academy of Sciences estimates that 25 percent of these diseases in children are caused by environmental factors. Although birth defects are the leading cause of infant mortality, Ohio does not have a birth defects registry. Even though multiple sclerosis has increased by about 20 percent between 1986 and 1995, Ohio does not track this disease. And unfortunately, Ohio is not unusual, it is the norm. To fill this void, the Pew Commission proposed a nationwide health tracking network. The network involves three basic features. The first feature establishes and coordinates local, State, and Federal health agencies to collect vital data. This data becomes part of a national system to track and monitor priority chronic diseases and potentially related environmental factors. The second is an early warning system that would identify environmental health threats in their earliest stages and give public health officials valuable data about health risks, such as lead poisoning. This network would be similar to the existing system that informs communities about infectious disease outbreaks. The final piece consists of enhancing and coordinating local, State and Federal health officials into rapid response teams to quickly investigate clusters and outbreaks. The response system would include regional programs to investigate local health problems and centers at our universities to assist with research and data analysis. The network would provide our doctors and hospitals, public health officials and communities, with data on patterns and possible environmental factors to enable them to form preventive strategies. Currently, chronic diseases cost our country $325 billion annually and are expected to reach $1 trillion in 15 years. These medical costs could be reduced significantly if we had data to prevent the onset of these diseases. The network has estimated the cost at about $275 million, or less than $1 for every man, woman and child in America. This investment is necessary now to stem the crushing medical costs to our country. This subcommittee and the Administration have rightfully doubled the investment in NIH. But we need to fund a network to give our NIH scientists the data they need. As a Nation, we can track birds and people with West Nile virus and the ebola virus on another continent. But we still can't track asthma. In the fiscal year 2001 budget, this subcommittee asked the CDC to research developing a network and expects the CDC to present the findings during this year. Now I am asking this subcommittee to finish what you have already begun. Please make the investment in this basic public health tracking tool. Only with your help can we pull our health tracking system into the 21st century and win the war against chronic diseases that cause so much human suffering. I thank you for the privilege of testifying. [The information follows:] [GRAPHIC(S) NOT AVAILABLE IN TIFF FORMAT] Mr. Regula. Thank you. Lou, where would you think we should put this kind of a record keeping, data collecting, in NIH or CDC or HHS? Mr. Stokes. I would think probably, Mr. Chairman, that CDC ought to be the appropriate agency here. And as I said, in the 2001 budget, the subcommittee asked CDC to look into this matter and report back to the subcommittee. I would think that they would probably be the correct one, the Centers for Disease Control. Mr. Regula. Right. Questions? Mrs. Pelosi. Mrs. Pelosi. Just a comment, Mr. Chairman. I thank--it's music to our ears to hear the maestro sing this song. Because this is such an important issue and you've worked on it so many years, Mr. Stokes. I just want to call the Chairman's attention, this subject came up, whether it was yesterday or the day before, when we were talking about the Sugar Law Guild Center, where they talked about tracking, and especially in minority communities, which are disproportionately affected by some of this, and the tracking will give us the data to verify that. But again, this was the only hearing that we had in this Committee, was on this subject, environmental health, and the issue of tracking was very, very important in that, the asthma, and how it affects children especially, is really a responsibility we have to get to the bottom of. So there's a connection to all of this. The non-profit community is playing a very major role, and with the prestige of Mr. Stokes, I'm sure we're going to find an answer to this. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. Thank you, Mr. Stokes. Mr. Stokes. Thank you very much. Mr. Regula. I checked with the staff, of course, as you know, the bill didn't get finished until December, early December or late November. Anyway, we don't have a report back yet, but we anticipate that coming this year, the response to the Committee's action. Mr. Stokes. Good. Mr. Regula. Any other questions? If not, thank you, Lou. We're happy to welcome you back here. Mr. Stokes. Thank you so much. Mr. Regula. It's a great idea. ---------- Thursday, March 22, 2001. SAFER FOUNDATION WITNESS DIANE WILLIAMS, PRESIDENT AND CEO, SAFER FOUNDATION Mr. Regula. We'll move on. Next, Mr. Jackson will introduce Diane Williams. Mr. Jackson. Mr. Chairman, as President of the Safer Foundation, a position she has held for four years, Diane Williams heads the Nation's leading non-profit provider of social services, education and job opportunities, exclusively targeting ex-offenders. Ms. Williams' association with Safer began in the 1970s as a volunteer, then serving on the agency's board of directors and as the vice president for development and strategic initiatives. Before she began her tenure at Safer, Ms. Williams was marketing director for the enhanced business unit at Ameritech, and she has held executive positions at AT&T and Rockwell International. Ms. Williams is an accomplished speaker in the areas of criminal justice policy, community corrections strategy, as well as prevention and basic education programming for adult and juvenile ex-offenders. She has been profiled in the Chicago Tribune, Chicago Sun Times, and her televised appearances include talk shows aired on CBS, NBC and WGN. In 1994, Diane was named the best and brightest among business executives by Dollars and Sense Magazine. Ms. Williams earned an MBA from Northwestern University and serves as an adjunct professor in marketing at Aurora College. Mr. Chairman and members of the Subcommittee, I present Ms. Diane Williams. Ms. Williams. Thank you, Congressman Jackson and Mr. Chairman, for allowing me to present the Safer Foundation to you today. You heard a long list of things that I've done, and this that I do today and throughout my time at the Safer Foundation is the most important work that I've done in my career. So you scare me to death when I come here and present this subject today. The Safer Foundation is a not-for-profit organization that works to reduce recidivism by supporting the efforts of former offenders to become productive, law-abiding members of their communities. We provide a full spectrum of services, including education, employment and case management. Established in 1972, with facilities in Chicago, Rock Island, Illinois and Davenport, Iowa, Safer has placed clients in over 40,000 jobs and is the largest community based provider of employment services for ex-offenders in this country. The Nation's prison population you know is on the rise. Over 600,000 men, women and youth are released from institutions each year. When ex-offenders come out of the correction system, they often have a variety of needs, as does the community have a variety of needs around helping them to re-integrate into society. All too often, many ex-offenders do not secure permanent, unsubsidized employment, because they lack occupational skills, have little or no job hunting experience, or find that many employers refuse to hire those with criminal records. Without a strong support system in place, all too often ex-offenders fall back into the criminal subculture. They do what they know how to do best. The re-entry partnerships initiative begun in 1999 is a Federal demonstration that assists eight States in confronting the challenges presented by the return of offenders from prison to the community. Funded through the Department of Justice, the Department of Labor and the Department of Health and Human Services, re-entry partnerships include identification of the appropriate re-entry offender population, surveillance and monitoring, community based support resources, and coordination between the criminal justice system and the employment, social services and treatment systems. The Safer Foundation respectfully requests that the subcommittee continue to support and to expand this important initiative. Safer is also committed to bridging the gaps that preclude the ex-offender population from successfully living in the community. We do that by providing, as we said, employment services geared to make successful job placements. We have employment specialists who work with our clients to complete job applications, to train them on how to behave inthe interview process, but even more importantly, to train them on how to behave in the job once achieved, so that they might not only be placed in employment, but retain that employment for a long, successful period of time. We have focused lots of our efforts on what we call a lifeguard position, which supports that client around those issues that arise while working sometimes or often for the first time when you're working, how you interact with your supervisor, how to work with other people and how to keep up your commitment as a team member in that work environment. The one on one relationship provided by our job developers is critical as we transition or assist to transition people into the mainstream. In addition to offering job training and placement, Safer also offers education programs. Current research indicates that the more education an offender has, the less likely they are to return to prison. Our youth empowerment program is one of Safer's most effective education programs, both in terms of helping clients earn their GEDs and also in reducing recidivism. Sixteen to 21 year olds are referred by probation and parole officers, or word of mouth, and are placed in this program which is designed to help students continue their education and training after Safer. Rather than provide traditional classroom instruction, which we know has been a failure for the clients that we serve, we offer an approach that's considered peer tutoring, or in today's more appropriate terminology, cooperative education. We started it before there was such a term as cooperative education. In addition to learning basic skills to prepare for taking the GED, these youthful ex-offenders learn problem solving skills that are needed to succeed in the world of work and community, increase their level of confidence in their ability to learn and to make and sustain constructive life changes. Of the over 300 students that have participated in our youth empowerment program, 81 percent complete the program. And their academic progress increased 12.5 percent from pre to post GED readiness. This is the equivalent of three grade levels in an eight week period of time. Of the students who finish the program, 50 percent passed the GED exam the first time they took it, a pass rate well above the State average, and actually the norm that the country averages. Nearly 200 of the students who completed the training were placed in either higher education, vocational training or jobs, and 95 percent completed at least 30 days retention in their placements. Perhaps most significantly, our three year recidivism rate for the youth empowerment program is only 21.4 percent, less than half of the Illinois juvenile rate of 51 percent for the same period. We are in the process of building a program on the south side of Chicago because three out of the four students that apply for our program today are denied access to the program. We are asking your support in continuing that project that Congressman Jackson was very instrumental in helping us to start this year. Thank you. [The information follows:] [GRAPHIC(S) NOT AVAILABLE IN TIFF FORMAT] Mr. Regula. Thank you. How far out do you reach? Do you go beyond Illinois? Ms. Williams. We've gone into Illinois and Iowa, have not gone beyond those two States today. It is interesting that you ask that question, Mr. Chairman, because a number of other folks are asking us about coming to States where they serve. Mr. Regula. I think I heard you say that among juveniles, the recidivism rate is 51 percent? Ms. Williams. In the State of Illinois, for the 16 to 21 year old age group, that's correct. Mr. Regula. I suspect it's even higher--I was on the Ohio Crime Commission, and at that time it was 75 percent in the adult population. That's tragic. Ms. Williams. It is tragic. On the adult side, we have in Illinois, it's almost 50 percent. Our recidivism rate for the adult population that we serve is 17 percent. So we do help people. Mr. Regula. The ones you serve are at 17 percent? Ms. Williams. That's correct. Mr. Regula. Those that are outside the system, it's probably much higher. Ms. Williams. That's correct. Mr. Regula. Any other questions? Yes, Mr. Kennedy. Mr. Kennedy. Yes, Mr. Chairman, I want to commend the good work that's being done, just say, we have a permanent prison class in this country right now, 2 million people in jail. These people are going to have to come out. And the thought that we as a Nation have not come to grips with what that's going to mean, I mean, these are people with a record. They're going to be living in our society, trying to get jobs, trying to get re-integrated. I mean, we're going to pay the price as a Nation if we don't come up with a better solution than we have now for helping them re-integrated into the community. And every one of those people that you're saving is also, I would venture to say, many families who might otherwise be victimized by this person that you're saving, a lot of heartache and grief. So I think you're doing more than our own criminal justice system is doing to help keep our communities safer. And I want to thank you for the good work you're doing. Ms. Williams. Thank you very much. Mr. Regula. Thank you. ---------- Thursday, March 22, 2001. MARYLAND STATE DEPARTMENT OF EDUCATION WITNESS NANCY S. GRASMICK, MARYLAND STATE SUPERINTENDENT OF SCHOOLS, MARYLAND STATE DEPARTMENT OF EDUCATION Mr. Regula. Our next witness, Mr. Hoyer will introduce Dr. Nancy Grasmick. Mr. Hoyer. Thank you very much, Mr. Chairman. While Dr. Grasmick is coming forward, I'll start to introduce her. Dr. Grasmick has been superintendent of schools in Maryland since 1991, for over a decade. Nancy, are you the longest serving superintendent in the United States now? Ms. Grasmick. There's one other that's longer. Mr. Hoyer. Dr. Grasmick is a graduate of Johns Hopkins University, Towson and of Gallaudet. So she has a very broad background and a lot of ways to communicate with people, and does so extraordinarily well on behalf of children and on behalf of families. I'm not objective when it comes to Dr. Grasmick, I must say, because Judy, my wife Judy and Nancy were at Towson together, and graduated together and worked together throughout their professional careers and frankly, until Judy died. Dr. Grasmick has received too many awards, Mr. Chairman, for me to articulate. But if you read her resume, she has been cited as one of Maryland's most outstanding leaders, one of the Nation's most outstanding educators, has been cited, as I say, both by National and State organizations for her work and leadership in education. She has been the superintendent, which is, by the way, selected by our board, under two governors. She is the only person that I know of that was the secretary of two departments at the same time in the State of Maryland. She was with Juvenile Family--what was the name of it, Nancy? Ms. Grasmick. The Office for Children, Youth and Families. Mr. Hoyer. The Office of Children, Youth and Families, which we have a similar one, as well as the superintendent of schools, an extraordinarily accomplishment. She has been recognized by her peers throughout the Nation as somebody who has brought a commitment to quality education and to accountability, which is being discussed, properly so, so widely. So I'm pleased on behalf of all the Committee to welcome Dr. Grasmick to our Committee, and look forward to her testimony. Ms. Grasmick. Thank you. Thank you, Mr. Hoyer. It's really an honor to be here and testify before you, Mr. Chairman, and members of the Committee. It is also an honor to perpetuate the vision of an extraordinary woman, Judy Hoyer, who was such a champion and pioneer for young children in the State of Maryland. In her honor, and because of her incredible work, we have created in the State of Maryland a concept known as the Judy Center. As you begin your work on the fiscal year 2002 budget, I'm asking that you give consideration to nationally replicating this incredible collaborative full service program for all of America's young children. What is a Judy Center? It is a comprehensive early childhood education program, which is coupled with family support services for children birth through six years of age and their families. It is either located in a public school or located in a facility in close proximity to an elementary school. Currently in the State of Maryland, our Judy Centers are serving over 4,400 of these young children. Over the years, Government has been dedicated to generating program after program, wonderful programs, for young children and their families. However, these programs have been generated in a piece-meal fashion where they are scattered across communities, where space is sometimes the primary consideration of where they will be located. Often citizens do not know of the existence of these services and they don't have the capability to access them. Imagine needing three or four different services for your child, but you don't have transportation to even get to one service. It can be a daunting task, and sometimes the conclusion is, it's easier not to participate than to try to figure out how to access these services. This is the wonderful part of the Judy Centers. We take the best part of Government, all of the helpful services being generated, and make them accessible to families. This is cost effective, it provides services to our citizens, but in addition to that, it provides for cost avoidance. In the State of Maryland, we are spending more than $328 million a year of State and Federal funding to help children catch up as they matriculate through their school career. We're all aware of the current brain research talking about the potential for learning that young children have. In Maryland, we've created a kindergarten work sampling system, and we have concluded that 40 percent of the children entering kindergarten in the State of Maryland are not ready to learn as we've defined it as a national goal. These Judy Centers offer full day, full year services, including kindergarten, pre- kindergarten, therapeutic nurseries, special education services, infant and toddler programs, before and after school child care, Head Start, Family Support Centers, Healthy Families, parent involvement programs, community health programs. It builds a continuum of education and support services from birth through school entry. Thirteen of our 24 jurisdictions in the State of Maryland currently have Judy Centers. We anticipate the expansion very soon. Why do these centers work? In addition to the reasons I've already cited, they are results oriented, strong accountability for outcomes, program accreditation is a requirement for all of the programs contained in these centers. Family support services are required. Project coordination and case management services are essential. Finally, it brings together a whole community of professionals. And I would say that all of us in this room know that education is the bridge to opportunity. The Judy Centers help young children and their families take those first steps on that bridge. Thank you. [The information follows:] [GRAPHIC(S) NOT AVAILABLE IN TIFF FORMAT] Mr. Regula. Thank you. That's a wonderful legacy for Judy Hoyer. A couple of questions. Can you use Title I or do you use Head Start money to finance these? How do you handle that? Ms. Grasmick. We cobble together a lot of the dollars that we receive. Yes, we do use Head Start monies for a portion of this, and yes, we do use some of our Title I funding for a portion of this. Certainly we do that. But it's all of the collateral services that make these so special that often are not funded. Mr. Regula. Do you use volunteers at all, medical personnel or consultants? Ms. Grasmick. We have medical personnel, we have the presence of higher education in terms of doing professional development for the individuals who work in these centers. So there's a K-16 relationship, as well as social workers, health professionals, etc. Mr. Regula. Another aside. Do you do testing in the Maryland system? Ms. Grasmick. We certainly do, throughout the school career of children. I'm proud to say in quality counts, which is the national assessment of all 50 States, Maryland was rated number one with a score of 98 for its assessment accountability and standards. Mr. Regula. Questions? Mr. Hoyer. She's terrific, isn't she? [Laughter.] Obviously I'm not very subjective on this issue, Mr. Chairman, I admit to that. But I know those of my colleagues who have served on this Committee for some time, Nita Lowey and I particularly, talking about comprehensive schools, and in Dr. Grasmick's testimony, this is not necessarily a program that costs more money. What it seeks to do, we have at the Federal and State levels a lot of programs that all of us have sponsored or supported, that have a multiplicity of parents who are all very proud of those programs. The problem that Judy had and that others have at the local level is looking sort of at this array of programs that are designed to help Mary Jane or Johnny Brown. But the complexity of getting from HHS, Department of Education, Department of Transportation, Department of Agriculture, HUD and other agencies who have resources available to help children learn better and to help their families be more functional and therefore have the family unit and the child ready to learn and learning well, is a challenge. I will be introducing in the next couple of weeks the Full Service Community Schools Act of 2001. I put $500,000 in this bill about five years ago, for the purposes of having a study done by HHS and the Department of Education on how to better do this. They came out with a report, we didn't implement it as quickly as we could. The Governor and Judy, the present Governor, who was then county executive of Prince George's County, and Governor Schaffer, then our Governor, very close to Dr. Grasmick, and Judy put together a similar center in Prince George's County, Mr. Chairman, and that has served as the model for this program that Dr. Grasmick and Governor Glendenning put together. In fact, it was Governor Glendenning's suggestion to name these the Judy Centers, which he thought was much more family friendly than the actual title of the bill, which was the Judith B. Hoyer Early Child Care and Education Act. But Dr. Grasmick, I want to thank you so very much for the leadership and commitment that you have shown in making sure not just that this program works, but that we are effectively reaching out to every child, and that like President Bush says, we cannot afford to leave a child behind. Thank you for being here, and thank you for your leadership. Ms. Grasmick. Thank you, Congressman. Mr. Regula. Mrs. Pelosi. Mrs. Pelosi. Mr. Chairman, I know usually you don't want us to have too many comments, but very briefly, I want to join Congressman Hoyer in welcoming Dr. Grasmick. Her reputation in Maryland is well established for a long time. As Steny pointed out in his opening remarks, her qualifications are exquisite. But I just want to thank you for this model, which as anyone who knew and loved Judy would know how much this means to her. I want to thank you and Mr. Hoyer for your leadership on this. Your successful implementation of it serves as a model to the rest of the country. For that we're all grateful. Thank you. Ms. Grasmick. Thank you. Mr. Regula. Thank you for being here. We have a motion to adjourn on the Floor. If everybody could go over and get back quickly. I think Mr. Jackson--Mr. Peterson will do one other one until you get back and introduce your witness. I think, Mr. Hoyer, you have some, too. Mr. Hoyer. I'll go vote. Mr. Regula. So we will do one, then we'll go to yours, Mr. Jackson. ---------- Thursday, March 22, 2001. MINORITY HEALTH PROFESSIONS SCHOOLS WITNESS RONNY B. LANCASTER, MBA, J.D., PRESIDENT, ASSOCIATION OF MINORITY HEALTH PROFESSIONS SCHOOLS Mr. Regula. Okay, we'll get started. Mr. Jackson, if you'd like to introduce your guest today, Mr. Ronny Lancaster. Mr. Jackson. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. Mr. Chairman, thank you for the opportunity to introduce Ronny Lancaster. Mr. Lancaster is the Senior Vice President for Management and Policy at the Morehouse School of Medicine, and the President of the Association of Minority Health Professions Schools. Mr. Chairman, the Association of Minority Health Professions Schools is comprised of the Nation's 12 historically black medical, dental, pharmacy and veterinary schools. Combined, these institutions have graduated 50 percent of all African American physicians and dentists, 60 percent of all African American pharmacists, and 75 percent of all African American veterinarians. Mr. Chairman, working closely with the Association in the 106th Congress, we were successful in passing legislation establishing the National Center for Minority Health and Health Disparities at the NIH. Following the passage of this legislation, this subcommittee included a line item appropriation of $130 million in fiscal year 2001. Mr. Chairman, members of the subcommittee, I want to thank Mr. Lancaster and the Association of Minority Health Professions Schools for their commitment to improving the health status of all Americans, and I look forward to working with Mr. Lancaster. Mr. Lancaster, welcome to the subcommittee. Mr. Lancaster. Thank you, Mr. Jackson. Thank you, Mr. Chairman, and good morning to you and members of the subcommittee and to Mr. Jackson. Mr. Chairman, it's an honor to appear before the subcommittee this morning, and thank you for the opportunity. It is an honor to be introduced by any member of Congress, and a privilege to be introduced by Congressman Jackson, a member not only of this subcommittee, but a member who has distinguished himself in that in just a second term he has successfully sponsored legislation which leads to the improvement of lives for millions of Americans in our association and the Nation. We owe Mr. Jackson and his colleagues a debt of gratitude for their hard work, their vision and their commitment in accomplishing this most important objective. Our association also welcomes you, Mr. Chairman, and we look forward to a long association during your tenure as Chair. We ask that the record reflect our deep appreciation to Chairman John Porter who led this subcommittee with distinction. Mr. Chairman, before beginning my formal testimony, I'd like the opportunity, very briefly, to introduce the gentleman to my left, your right. This is Dr. John E. Maupin, President of Meharry Medical College. It will be my privilege to hand over the gavel as president of this association to Dr. Maupin in about two weeks. Mr. Chairman, you may know, and interestingly, Mrs. Pelosi mentioned in introducing Mr. Stokes, she referred simply to difficult days in our Nation's history. We, I think, all recognize that our history has been punctuated by glorious moments, and yet simultaneously, unfortunately, there have been difficult times. Meharry Medical College stands alone with Howard University School of Medicine as only two universities in this Nation where for almost eight decades, these were the only medical schools in the country where African American and other students were allowed to go for medical education. So it is a privilege to introduce Dr. Maupin, and again a privilege to hand the gavel to him. Mr. Chairman, I'm here this morning to ask the support of the subcommittee for three areas. These include support for the continuation of the doubling effort for the National Institutes of Health, support for the Title III program which is administered by the U.S. Department of Education, and finally, support for a group of programs administered by the Health Resources and Services Administration, HRSA, collectively referred to as Health Professions Programs. To go through these, just a word about each of these quickly, Mr. Chairman. Support for the doubling of the appropriation to support the National Institutes of Health is nearly universal. We add our voice to that chorus. The National Institutes of Health has done a magnificent job in leading the world in scientific inquiry and discovery, leading in turn to the improved health status of many Americans. Regrettably, despite the success, NIH has not done as good a job focusing on the important subject of minority health and health disparities. Now, thanks to the leadership of Mr. Jackson and Congressman Charlie Norwood, and the strong support of Republican and Democratic leaders in both chambers, we now have at NIH a new national center for minority health and health disparities charged with examining these very important issues. So we support a 16 percent increase for NIH and request also a funding level of $200 million for this new center, to enable it to conduct the important work for which it has been charged. Secondly, Mr. Chairman, with respect to the Title III program, this program is authorized by Title III of the Higher Education Act, commonly referred to as Title III, and its purpose simply is to strengthen historically black graduate institutions by establishing and strengthening program development offices, helping to initiate endowment campaigns at those institutions, strengthening information technology programs and finally, strengthening their library capacity. And finally, Mr. Chairman, I will say also, we are very appreciative to this subcommittee for their very strong support of this program last year, and we request support again in this program at the level of $60 million. Finally, in the area of health professions, we ask your support for the group of programs collectively referred to as Health Professions, programs such as the Health Careers Opportunities Program, HCOP, which encourages minority and underprivileged youth to consider careers in health professions, another program, Scholarships for Disadvantaged Students, which makes it possible for these students, frankly, to receive an education. And finally, Centers of Excellence programs, which seeks to support a level of excellence at each of our institutions. These programs, Mr. Chairman, collectively, without exaggeration, are the difference at our institutions between the doors being open and closed. So in closing, Mr. Chairman, once again I'd like to thank Mr. Porter for his leadership in the past. I'd like to thank Mr. Jackson for the privilege of introducing me this morning. And finally, thank you, Mr. Chairman, for the privilege of appearing this morning. Welcome, and we look forward to working with you during your tenure. [The information follows:] [GRAPHIC(S) NOT AVAILABLE IN TIFF FORMAT] Mr. Regula. Thank you. How many institutions do you represent? Mr. Lancaster. There are nine institutions, Mr. Chairman, with twelve graduate programs at these nine institutions. These institutions are located throughout the country. Mr. Regula. Are these exclusively African Americans, or do you have a mixture of student body? Mr. Lancaster. They all have a history in the African American tradition, that is to say, they are HBCUs. But, it's really important to emphasize that each of our institutions admit a wide range of students. My institution, for example, the Morehouse School of Medicine, 80 percent are African American students, approximately 10 percent are Hispanic and 10 percent are white. Mr. Regula. Okay, thank you. Mr. Jackson, questions? Thank you for coming. Mr. Lancaster. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. ---------- Thursday, March 22, 2001. SOCIETY FOR INVESTIGATIVE DERMATOLOGY WITNESSES LUIS A. DIAZ, M.D., PRESIDENT, THE SOCIETY FOR INVESTIGATIVE DERMATOLOGY; CHAIRMAN, DEPARTMENT OF DERMATOLOGY, UNIVERSITY OF NORTH CAROLINA AT CHAPEL HILL DANIELLE CURTIS DAVID ZARET Mr. Regula. Next is Dr. Luis Diaz, The Society for Investigative Dermatology and Chairman of the Department of Dermatology, University of North Carolina, and accompanied by Danielle Curtis and David Zaret. Dr. Diaz. Thank you, Mr. Chairman, subcommittee members. On behalf of the Society for Investigative Dermatology, the thousands of patients with skin diseases and myself, I wish to thank you, Mr. Chairman, for this opportunity to testify before your Committee. I am Luis Diaz, President of the Society for Investigative Dermatology, a dermatologist dedicated to patient care, skin research and training of dermatologists and scientists. I work at the University of North Carolina. On my left is Danielle Curtis, a patient suffering with vertiligo, an autoimmune disease in which the immune system destroys the pigment of the cells. On my right is Mr. David Zaret, a patient suffering from a disease named anthivulgaris, an autoimmune disease in which the immune system destroys the skin on the lining of the oral cavity. These diseases were lethal until the decade of the 1950s. Complications of treatment of these diseases are serious. You can imagine the problems that Danielle and David are suffering every day of their lives. The mission of the Society for Investigative Dermatology is to support research in skin diseases, and to facilitate the training of physicians and scientists of the future. We believe that scientific research on skin diseases is the best approach to bring hope and assistance to millions of Americans of all ages, gender and ethnicity that are currently suffering from these ailments. Through research, we wish to enhance our knowledge in prevention, diagnosis and treatment of skin diseases. We have four suggestions which are also advocated by the American Academy of Dermatology, representing all U.S. dermatologists, and the Coalition of Patient Advocates for Skin Disease Research, which is composed of 24 organizations concerned with skin diseases. One, our Society is deeply grateful to the members of this Committee for our efforts to double the funding of NIH over five years. We support the proposal of the Ad Hoc Group for Medical Research Funding, which calls for a 16.5 percent increase in funding for NIH in fiscal year 2002 and specifically for the National Institute of Arthritis, Musculoskeletal and Skin Diseases, NIAMS. Last year, Congress passed and the President signed a bill which included a major section regarding clinical research and loan repayment provisions for young trainees interested in biomedical research. The pool of physician scientists is decreasing at an alarming rate in all fields of medicine, and in dermatology. We request that this Committee provide the appropriate level of funding for this new, important legislative initiative. You would be surprised, Mr. Chairman, the information regarding total cost to society of a skin disease is not updated since 1979. Information about incidence, prevalence, mortality and disability, along with the economic cost is unavailable. Also unavailable is information about loss of economic productivity and activities that are foregone as a result of disease. A number of Federal agencies collect information about these matters. We believe a workshop developed under the auspices of the NIAMS and including representatives of all various agencies to identify existing information sources on the causes and scope of skin diseases, and to recommend strategies to developing new information sources would be very valuable. Such a workshop would be useful to NIAMS for its own planning purposes, it would be useful to the field of dermatology for its use in planning for future research, manpower and service needs. And it would be very helpful to the volunteer organizations in informing their constituencies on patients, for raising funds from the public for research. If the committee is interested, we would be pleased to work with your staff regarding bill report language in that regard. Thank you very much for giving me the opportunity. I am pleased to answer any questions you may have, Mr. Chairman. [The information follows:] [GRAPHIC(S) NOT AVAILABLE IN TIFF FORMAT] Mr. Regula. Thank you. Any questions? Thank you for coming. I see you're headquartered in Cleveland, is that right? Or the Society is. Dr. Diaz. In Cleveland, yes. Mr. Regula. How many members do you have nationwide? Dr. Diaz. Three thousand. Mr. Regula. Mostly physicians that treat? Dr. Diaz. Physicians and scientists working in research in dermatology. Mr. Regula. So you get help from NIH? Dr. Diaz. We get help from NIH, yes. Mr. Regula. Okay. Thank you for coming. Dr. Diaz. Thank you very much, Mr. Chairman. ---------- Thursday, March 22, 2001. RETT SYNDROME ASSOCIATION WITNESSES KATHY HUNTER, FOUNDER AND PRESIDENT, INTERNATIONAL RETT SYNDROME ASSOCIATION CHERYL DUNIGAN Mr. Regula. Next, Mr. Hoyer will introduce Kathy Hunter. Mr. Hoyer. Thank you very much, Mr. Chairman. I also understand she's joined by Dr. Dunigan. Mr. Chairman, some years ago, Kathy, when did we do this, 1985? Ms. Hunter. In 1986. Mr. Hoyer. In 1986, I spoke with Chairman Natcher, and we had some testimony about a disease, an affliction that I had no knowledge of. But I knew a wonderful, and still know, a wonderful young woman named Christy. And she and I went to church together. She at that point in time, I presume, was about seven or eight years of age. For the first 18 months of her life, she developed normally, 16, 20 months, developed normally. And then for some unknown reason, her neurological development not only stopped, but it went back. And to this day, she has not progressed much beyond the age of a 14 or 15 month old. Her body has developed, obviously. She is still a good friend, and I see her in church from time to time, not as often as she used to come. She's a wonderful young woman. She was afflicted with what we now know is Rett Syndrome. It is a syndrome that affects young women at that age. The tragedy of course is that it afflicts a normally growing child that parents have related to for the first few months of life, thinking that their child was going to develop fully and normally. We put $500,000, we didn't earmark it, but we put in, we asked NIH to look at this. And both Johns Hopkins and Baylor undertook to look at this syndrome and have now developed, identified and we are making progress. Kathy Hunter has a child as well with Rett Syndrome, and founded an organization to spur research and development, and parents getting together and talking to one another and making it easier to cope and to understand and work on behalf of these afflicted young children. She has done an extraordinary job, as so many citizens who take unto themselves the personal responsibility to make a difference. She and her husband have made an extraordinary difference, and I am pleased to be her friend and to welcome her to this Committee. She is one of those advocates on behalf of health of her own child, but on behalf of thousands and thousands of other children and parents, and of our society. John Kennedy once said, in talking about some children with disabilities that although these children were the victims of fate, they would not be the victims of our neglect. And certainly, Kathy Hunter has not neglected these children. Thank you, Kathy, for all you've done. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. Ms. Hunter. We're so appreciative for your leadership and your advocacy and support and that of the Committee over the years. Julia Roberts has just become our national spokesperson, and we made a film that's now showing on Discovery Health. Mr. Hoyer. Kathy, if you could tell her that I would certainly be open to working closely with her as well---- [Laughter.] Mr. Hoyer. I love seeing you, I want you to know that, I don't want her as an alternative. But you could bring her to testify next time. Ms. Hunter. It would be very helpful to have a pretty woman, but we're also very happy to have your support. Mr. Hoyer. Thank you. Ms. Hunter. Thank you for this opportunity to convey the importance of increased funding to the National Institutes of Health to accelerate research on the cause, treatment and cure for neurological disorders. The International Rett Syndrome Association joins the biomedical community's efforts to double the NIH budget by fiscal year 2003 and stands by the request for a $3.4 billion increase for NIH in fiscal year 2002. The impact and burden of neurological diseases cannot be emphasized enough. As I have for the last 16 years, I come before this Committee to talk about the Rett Syndrome story. It's the tale of a unique and puzzling brain disorder which doesn't show its face until the child is about a year old, andhas achieved normal developmental milestones, and then a frightening mental and physical deterioration follows. Rett Syndrome robs its victims of the ability to walk, speak, and use their hands purposefully. It renders children incapable of performing the simplest acts of daily living without total assistance from others. Though rarely fatal, Rett Syndrome follows a tragic and irreversible course leaving its victims permanently impaired for life. Pearl Buck said, ``We learn as much from sorrow as from joy, as much from illness as from health, as much from handicap as from advantage and indeed, perhaps more.'' And this is true. Parents learn many good lessons in their journey with Rett Syndrome, but our children's suffering does not begin to balance the knowledge or insight gained from the terrible tragedy of Rett Syndrome. My daughter with Rett Syndrome is 27 years old. She's as tall as my heart. Think of what it would be like to realize that your child will never grow up like her brothers or sisters, and imagine what it's like to provide the kind of care and support required for an infant, but for a lifetime. But I'm not here to tell you just about the bad news about Rett Syndrome. I'm here to share some marvelous news, and that is that last year when I was here, I told you about the dedication and triumph that led to the miraculous discovery of the gene for Rett Syndrome. Located on the X chromosome, this gene produces part of a switch that shuts off the production of proteins. When these are not shut off when they should be, the protein over-production causes nervous system deterioration which you see in Rett Syndrome. This finding is the first incidence of a human disease caused by defects in a protein whose function it is to silence other genes. So in a way, Rett Syndrome is the little disease that could. The gene discovery will help us better understand the disease process in Rett Syndrome and will likely lead to treatments. Because brain development continues long after birth and symptoms of Rett Syndrome do not develop for several months, there's a window of opportunity during infancy in which we might be able to intervene to prevent further damage, something we never thought possible before. In fact, clinical trials based on the gene discovery are already underway. One of the most thrilling pieces of news is the recent development, just in the last two weeks, of two animal models which mimic Rett Syndrome. These mouse models will allow drug experimentation which may mitigate the damage or improve function, and will permit post-mortem studies at all stages of development. Even more exciting, researchers will be able to study the effects of the mutation in animals who have not yet developed clinical symptoms. These studies could answer many questions about the cascading effect of the mutation in the brain and throughout the body, both before and after birth. The understanding of these basic molecular changes greatly improves our understanding of finding prevention and treatment strategies. Studies of the mouse have already shown that the genetic defect is in effect not only during brain development before birth, but has a critical prolonged effect even after birth. Since it's easier to treat newborns than to correct defects in embryonic development, this gives us hope and promise for future treatments. Since the first time I came before this Committee, we have come such a long way. I told you, now I'm wearing reading glasses and I brought my grandchild with me. So back in 1986, when NIH funding began, it was a study of a rare and little understood disorder. It was a pretty risky venture. Work had to start at the beginning, because this was a disorder that had nothing more than a name. Before the gene discovery diagnosing Rett Syndrome before the age of four or five years was often difficult. Today, we have a new genetic test to improve the speed and accuracy of early diagnosis, and people don't have to wait like I did until my daughter was 10 years old, and also to screen prenatally in families who already have a child with Rett Syndrome. Another significant result is the discovery that Rett Syndrome is not limited to females, as previously thought. It's now known that while rare, males can have Rett Syndrome, they die before birth or shortly after birth. So the mutation could play a major role in non-specific mental retardation in both males and females. The finding of the MECP2 mutation appears also in people who do not have Rett Syndrome and this knowledge leads us to know that it's responsible for milder forms of mental retardation, and may account for a large number, about 65 percent of people who have mental retardation and have no known diagnosis for it. So this rare, little-known disorder that came to your attention some 16 years ago may have a profound effect that lasts far beyond Rett Syndrome. The biggest news in this story is not about Rett Syndrome, it's about those thousands and thousands of people who fall into that category, the 65 percent of unknown causes for mental retardation. So we urge you to increase funding that will bring about a better tomorrow and a brighter future for people with neurological disorders. Thank you. [The information follows:] [GRAPHIC(S) NOT AVAILABLE IN TIFF FORMAT] Mr. Hoyer. I want to again thank you. The bad news is that this syndrome exists. The good news is, as Kathy indicated, that we've had recently some extraordinary progress. I would say to my friend, Don Sherwood, and Patrick Kennedy, who are both spending their first few days on this Committee, it is an extraordinary opportunity to assist both individuals but more importantly, millions of people in the United States and around the world. Dr. Rett is from Switzerland, right? Ms. Hunter. Austria. Mr. Hoyer. Austria, excuse me. From Austria. He was the first medical doctor to identify this, but NIH grants to Hopkins and Baylor have been really the spur that has led to the discoveries. So it is a good news story as well that we are on the brink, hopefully, of possibly prevention and perhaps even amelioration. Thank you, Kathy. Doctor, thank you. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. Mr. Regula. Thank you. Thank you for coming. ---------- Thursday, March 22, 2001. AMERICAN ACADEMY OF FAMILY PHYSICIANS WITNESS JAMES C. MARTIN, M.D., BOARD MEMBER, AMERICAN ACADEMY OF FAMILY PHYSICIANS Mr. Regula. Next we have our colleague from San Antonio, Texas, Mr. Charles Gonzalez, who's going to introduce Dr. James Martin. Welcome, Mr. Gonzalez. Mr. Gonzalez. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. Good morning, Mr. Chairman, members of the Committee. It is a distinct pleasure, of course, to be introducing someone who will be testifying here this morning who is from San Antonio. It's Jim Martin, and as I said, he is from San Antonio, and he's here representing the American Academy of Family Physicians, AAFP. After 20 years of private practice, Dr. Martin now serves as program director for the Family Residency Program at Santa Rosa Health Care in San Antonio. He is also a clinical professor with the University of Texas Health Science Center in San Antonio. Dr. Martin has been a member of the AAFP since 1976, and currently serves on the board of directors. The AAFP represents more than 88,000, I believe it may be closer to, or surpasses now, 90,000 family physicians, family practice residents and medical students nationwide. Health profession training programs are vital in the effort to train more family doctors, especially in medically under- served communities, much like my district, San Antonio, Texas. What determines the effectiveness of a Congress is how well informed are its members. So to Dr. Martin and all other witnesses that will be testifying today, I commend them. And as a member of Congress, and even on behalf of this Committee, the important role that you play to inform us in making the decisions that better serve our constituents. And with that, it's a great pleasure to introduce Dr. Jim Martin of San Antonio. Dr. Martin. I would like to address three specific funding issues with you this morning. The first is family medicine training under Section 747 of the Public Health Safety Act. The second is the Agency for Health Care Research and Quality, and the third are the rural public health programs which you now sponsor. Before doing that, the Academy has asked me to thank this Subcommittee for its incredible support for these programs through the years. We especially appreciate your recognition last year of the need to enhance the program by additional funding in fiscal year 2001. The Academy now asks you to also provide appropriate support for Section 47 by $158 million, $96 million of which will go to family medicine training. That becomes very important to us, especially at a time when the Administration budget blueprint suggests that cuts should occur in these programs. The rationale of the cuts is based on the presupposition that there already are enough primary care family physicians, and that the market should be able to regulate the supply itself. The realities of health care in American would suggest otherwise, which I would like to state to you. First of all, there is a shortage of primary care and family physicians in America. The Institute of Medicine, the Council on Graduate Medical Education, and other entities have long advocated that we have a balanced physician work force, 50 percent primary care physicians, 50 percent subspecialists. By the most conservative number that I could find, America is short 20,000 family physicians. And the markets have not helped us here, in that the number of students interested in primary care specialties have decreased over the last four years, and we suspect in the national residence and matching program that will come out today that that trend will still continue, with a decreased interest on the part of medical students. There is good news. Your Title VII funds have been effective. The Graham Policy Center has shown very clearly that students who are in medical schools receiving Title VII funding are more likely to go into primary care, they're more likely to go into family medicine, they're more likely to practice in rural areas, and as Congressman Gonzalez said, they're more likely to practice in the primary care health profession shortage areas, or HPSAs, which I will shorten it to at this point. A very intriguing study by the Graham Policy Centerlooked at the HPSAs across the country. There are 3,000 counties in the United States, 800 of which now are primary care HPSAs. If we take the general internists, general pediatricians and the obstetrician gynecologists out of this mix, there become another 176 counties that are HPSA designated. If we remove the family physicians, that number goes to almost 1,500. The conclusion is that family physicians are responsible for the health care infrastructure of half of the counties in the United States, and we don't have enough of them. Very briefly, I would also ask you to continue to support the ARHQ programs. We have worked very carefully with them. We especially appreciate what ARHQ brings to the table in its research at the practice level. We also appreciate their commitment to addressing some of the quality and health safety issues that we now are all concerned about. For the second the Subcommittee recognized that the research that's being done here is taking the new discoveries of the NIH and other basic biomedical technology and translating that into how we take better care of our patients at the doctor patient level, and we think this is some important. And finally, I ask you also to continue to support the National Health Care Service, your State offices of rural health, for the work that they do. That concludes my remarks. I'd be happy to respond to any questions that you might have. [The information follows:] [GRAPHIC(S) NOT AVAILABLE IN TIFF FORMAT] Mr. Regula. I agree with you, there's a real shortage. But how do you overcome the fact that here comes a student with a huge debt for education, and obviously, the specialists have better earning power than the family practice. I don't know if we can address that simply by saying we want more members in family practice. Dr. Martin. Well, they are issues that need to be addressed. I think that there are individuals out there who want to be what family doctors and the primary care physicians do. I think it's important for the medical schools to go back and look at their admitting policies and try to identify those, what shall I say, more altruistic individuals who are willing to take on jobs where they are not paid as well, and where their work hours are much longer than some of their subspecialty colleagues. Mr. Regula. Do you think Medicare's reimbursement rates tilts this table a little bit? Dr. Martin. They're certainly not helpful, especially for those in the rural or the inner city areas, like Congressman Gonzalez has. Mr. Regula. Mr. Kennedy. Mr. Kennedy. On the Medicare reimbursement, though, for the residency it tilts it, clearly. The subsidies are enormous for specialties. We should like to get some specific recommendations from you in terms of what we can pass on to our colleagues, because the reimbursement for these residencies, we're all paying for that. The Medicare program is subsidizing these people getting a specialty. So that's all money that's taxpayer money that's going to help educate someone to get higher earning power, and if it's the need of this country to have primary care physicians, we ought to reverse that policy, especially given the fact there's a shortage of graduate medical education dollars. We ought to point it, if we do have a shortage, towards those primary care professions. Dr. Martin. May I respond to Mr. Kennedy? We agree very much that needs to be addressed. As I stated earlier, there needs to be a balance. Obviously, we need many subspecialists. But we also need an appropriate number of primary care, and specifically family physicians. I hope that the work force policies will really look at that graduate medical education funding, and make sure the funds go to where this country needs it. Mr. Hoyer. I just want to make an observation. You have an extraordinarily effective member of Congress who has presented you to this Committee. His dad was a giant, as you know, in this institution. I am struck by the fact that his personality is different from his father's, but his father was and he is extraordinarily effective and popular and respected in this institution. I'm sure you probably know that, but I wanted to reiterate. He does a great job. Mr. Gonzalez. Thank you, Steny. Mr. Regula. Thank you. Thank you for bringing the doctor. I think you make a good point, Mr. Kennedy, we slant the table. Mr. Kennedy. In terms of budget cutting, there's always a fight for those of us who represent prime graduate medical education programs. And we're fighting for the dollars. But if there are going to be cuts, let's make sure that the funding goes to support our priorities. Mr. Hoyer. If Mr. Kennedy will yield, I am very confident that because Mr. Regula is such an effective leader of this Committee, that our 302(b) allocation will be sufficient to fund all the priorities that this Nation ought to be investing in. [Laughter.] Mr. Regula. Take down his words. [Laughter.] ---------- Thursday, March 22, 2001. OHIO STATE UNIVERSITY COLLEGE OF LAW WITNESS GREGORY H. WILLIAMS, DEAN OF THE OHIO STATE UNIVERSITY COLLEGE OF LAW Mr. Regula. Okay, Mr. Hoyer, you're going to introduce Greg Williams. Mr. Hoyer. Dr. Williams, the Dean of the---- Mr. Regula. I'm trying to figure this one out. It's an Ohio State University Law School Dean, and we go to Maryland to get him introduced. Mr. Hoyer. Well, it's not so surprising, because of course, Dr. Britt Kerwin was the President of the University of Maryland College Park for many years, until stolen away in the dead of night by Ohio State. But I frankly think that we're sort of a twofer here. I don't think it was lost on the folks that put together their spokesperson that he was from Ohio State. Not that they would be that cynical, understand. [Laughter.] I understand that. Mr. Regula. Trained in Maryland, learned well. Mr. Hoyer. Dean, we welcome you to this Committee. Mr. Chairman, I suppose the reason that I'm doing this is that I had been a proponent last year of a program that was authorized in 1998. The Dean is going to talk about it. But the effort is to, we talk about diversity, we talk about reaching out to people, and to include the legal profession, the medical profession, other professions, so that we do have a diversity, not just so that we have diversity for diversity's sake, but diversity so that we will have expertise and experience in various different cohorts of our population. It's an extraordinarily important effort. And so I suppose it's for that reason that I am doing this. But Dean, we welcome you to discuss this Thurgood Marshall program, Thurgood Marshall, of course, a son of Maryland as well. That may be another reason, Mr. Chairman, that I'm involved in this. But in any event, Ohio State, as you know, one of the great institutions of this country. And I might say, Dr. Kerwin, I teased, you didn't steal him at all, he chose to go there. But in my opinion, one of the finest educational leaders in our country. We were very, very sorry to lose him. He is an extraordinary talent, as you know, Dean, and I know a delight to work with as well. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. Mr. Williams. Thank you, Mr. Hoyer, and thank you, Mr. Chairman, for being here. I appreciate the opportunity, and Mr. Hoyer, you're right, Dr. Kerwin is truly outstanding and we are very fortunate to have him at Ohio State. As indicated, I am Dean of the Ohio State University College of Law. It's a real pleasure to be here. I want to thank you, Mr. Hoyer, for your support of Thurgood Marshall Educational Opportunity Program. It's been very important, and we appreciate that support. Actually, it's certainly consistent with things you've done in the past and things you've supported. You may not remember, but our meeting goes back many years ago. Thirty years ago, you and I served on the national membership committee of the Young Democratic Clubs of America. Mr. Hoyer. How could I forget? Mr. Williams. Thank you. So it's a real pleasure to be here today. I'm speaking as past president of the Association of American Law Schools, as well as Dean of the Ohio State University College of Law, and for Martha Barnett, the President of the American Bar Association, who unfortunately is not able to be here. But more importantly, actually, I'm speaking as a legal educator with 25 years experience working with the CLEO program, which I'm sure you know administers the Thurgood Marshall program. For almost a quarter of a century, I personally have recruited law students to this program, minority, disadvantaged students, and have worked with them to develop their legal careers. In 1999, I served as the first African American male president of the Association of American Law Schools, and my theme as president of the association of American Law Schools was enhancing diversity in the legal profession. I spent a lot of time working with law schools around the country talking about the issues that the Committee is concerned about. As you know, Congress has authorized the Thurgood Marshal program in the Higher Education Act Amendments of 1998, and the program is designed to increase the number of low income, minority and disadvantaged persons in the legal profession. The Marshall program is administered through the Council on Legal Education Opportunity, which is a non-profit organization supported by the American Bar Association, as well as the Association of American Law Schools and a number of other groups. The CLEO program was established in 1968 to make it possible for economically and culturally disadvantaged students to enter and successfully complete law school. Since that time, over 6,000, over 6,000 students have gone through the CLEO program. I have personally seen many of these students, in fact, I've taught in the CLEO programs in Iowa and Ohio and Wisconsin and other places. And of all the students that I've seen go through the program in the last 25 years, I can't recall more than two that did not successfully complete the program. So it is a program that truly has made a difference. In fact, I think there are three members of Congress presently serving who went through the CLEO program. It's a program that has truly made a difference. The CLEO training program as funded by the Marshall program has been so successful that many States have tried to emulate it. Chairman Regula, as you may know, Chief Justice Moyer, of the Supreme Court of Ohio, has developed a program to develop a CLEO type program in the State of Ohio to complement the national efforts that are ongoing, and Chief Justice Moyer, of course, has provided greater leadership on this issue. By opening the doors of opportunity to more minority and disadvantaged students, the Marshall program will help to ensure that the legal profession reflects the diversity of the population that it serves. The social justice system that represents the population that it serves is a critical component to maintaining public trust and confidence in the justice system. A recent ABA report called Public Perceptions of the Justice System found that almost half of all Americans believe that the justice system treats minorities different than whites. A significant contributor to this perception is a society that's nearly 30 percent persons of color, yet minority representation in the legal profession is less than 10 percent. One key to remedy this crisis in confidence, in my view, in the justice system is to increase the number of minorities serving as lawyers, judges, prosecutors, public defenders and legislators. Over the past five years, minority law enrollment has increased only four-tenths of 1 percent, the smallest increase in the past 20 years. In 1999, the total number ofminority law graduates in the United States dropped for the first time since 1985. With the minority population growing in the United States and the law school enrollment increasing only at four-tenths of 1 percent, minority representation in the legal profession looks bleak. Currently, minority representation in other areas actually is much higher, including accounting and economics, engineering and medicine. All of those are higher in representation of minorities than the legal profession. Increasing diversity in the legal profession has multiple advantages even beyond the public trust and confidence. Within an educational setting, there's been a number of studies recently, for instance, one done at Harvard and the University of Michigan that found that it really made a difference when the classes were diverse in terms of the experience that the students were going to be able to get in law school. And of course, what we find is most of the, not most, but many of the graduates who go through the CLEO program and minority students are in fact going out to serve those communities that need service the most. It appears that my time is finished, but I would urge you to seriously consider funding the Thurgood Marshall program. It is a program that has truly made a difference in this country and deserves your continued support. And I thank you very much. [Editor's Note.--Prepared statement to be kept as part of committee files.] Mr. Regula. You make a very good point. Any other questions? Well, thank you for coming. We have a vote on the rule on tornado shelters and two suspensions and a possible motion to adjourn. I don't know why anyone would want to adjourn. [Recess.] Mr. Regula. We have a vote coming up very soon. Let us see if we can take one more witness before we have to vote. ---------- Thursday, March 22, 2001. COALITION OF ACADEMIC HEALTH CENTERS WITNESS DONALD C. HARRISON, SENIOR VICE PRESIDENT AND PROVOST FOR HEALTH AFFAIRS, UNIVERSITY OF CINCINNATI Dr. Harrison. Good morning, Mr. Chairman and members of the subcommittee. Mr. Chairman, your good friend, Bill Keating, who has visited me a number of times, sends his regards. My name is Dr. Donald Harrison. I am the Senior Vice President and Provost for Health Affairs at the University of Cincinnati. I am also a practicing cardiologist and I served as National President of the American Heart Association and Vice President of the American College of Cardiology. I was Chief of Cardiology for 20 years. I am here on behalf of a coalition of 20 academic health centers across the nation to highlight issues of concern to all academic health centers in the United States. We are the institutions that conduct a significant portion of extramural, biomedical and behavioral research funded through the National Institutes of Health. I would like to thank all of the members of this subcommittee for the outstanding support to NIH over the past several years. These additional funds have clearly had significant impact on the cause, prevention and the treatment of health problems, which afflict the citizens of our nation and the world. A few of these merit mention. First, the life expectancy of our citizens has increased by more than 20 years since the1930s to reach 76 years for males and 80 years for females for a child born today. Secondly, the adjusted death rate from heart disease and heart attacks has been reduced by 40 percent in the past 25 years. Thirdly, our ever-increasing elderly citizens live much more active lives, thanks to artificial joint replacement, pacemakers and medications which prevent osteoporosis and the treatment of breast and prostate cancer and the control of diabetes. On the other hand, the advances in the future, which can be developed from the human genome project, will dwarf our past accomplishments. I am here today to seek your support for further enhancing this extraordinary partnership that has been established with great foresight over the years between the academic institutions and the Federal government. For the fiscal year 2002, we urge you to provide a $3,400,000,000 increase for the NIH, which is a little more than 16 percent. Such an increase will bring the Agency's budget to $23,700,000,000 and keep on track to double the NIH budget by fiscal year 2003. I will repeat a statistic that I am sure you all are very aware of. The NIH currently funds fewer than four of every ten approved research grants. For this reason, I urge you to continue your efforts to double the NIH budget by 2003. We are really just at the dawn of the biomedical revolution. This increased funding will keep our world preeminence in medical innovation. It will also fuel our country's economic growth and development. Universities and other research institutions bear the cost for conducting NIH research that are not supported by the Federal research dollars. In fact, all institutions, both public and private, provide part of the research expense for their institutions. Let me raise a major concern regarding the state of extramural research facilities and laboratories. For the past two years the NIH has included $75,000,000 in extramural research facilities and laboratories. For the past two years the NIH has included $75,000,000 in extramural construction funding through the National Center for Research Resources. It is vitally important that institutions have the facilities and equipment to exploit research opportunities and utilize the increased projected grant funding. Exciting developments in genomics, molecular biology and neuroscience, cancer and many other fields require these kinds of laboratories and instrumentation. Even the best minds cannot compensate for outdated equipment and facilities. New technology is expensive, but it is important for the advancement of science. That National Science Foundation, in a study in 1998 on the status of scientific and engineering research facilities in the United States colleges and universities found that there was $11,500,000,000 in deferred research construction and repairs needed. I urge the subcommittee to provide the funding level of $250,000,000 for extramural research construction in the year 2002. A second significant concern of academic medical centers is the increased cost of research institutions for complying with research related Federal regulations. While extramural researchers have always been subject to Federal research regulations, the increasing number of research administration imposed on institutions has resulted in escalated costs. Let me stress that researchers are not opposed to providing these safeguards and do not question the necessity of the measures. But we believe that the Federal government and the Federal Research Institution should help us fund the cost of these regulations. Finally, I would ask the committee to consider $50,000,000 to go to the Agency for Health Care Research and Quality to reduce medical errors. This is a major problem. Mr. Chairman, the polls reflect the fact that the American public strongly supports Federal investment in biomedical research. Each of these institutions mentioned will increase the productivity of this relationship. Best wishes to you and good health to all Members of the Committee. [The information follows:] [GRAPHIC(S) NOT AVAILABLE IN TIFF FORMAT] Mr. Regula. We accept that. Mr. Hoyer. Mr. Chairman, I know you are trying to go vote, but Dr. Harrison mentioned that the average life expectancy of a child born today was 76 for males and 80 for females. Mr. William Hazeltine, whom you may know, who was one of the leaders in the mapping of the human genome, spoke to our bipartisan retreat. He indicated--and he was speaking to the younger members, not me, because my grandchildren perhaps fall in this category. He said he believes that the average life expectancy of the children of the younger Members, Patrick's age, would be 100 and that the life expectancy of our grandchildren would be 120, which obviously will be confronting us with extraordinary challenges as well. But it is amazing. Dr. Harrison. That is a wonderful goal. Mr. Kennedy. Mr. Chairman, that means when I get to be Chairman I get to be there for a while. Mr. Regula. That is right. Mr. Hoyer. He didn't say the rest of us were going to die real soon, however. Mr. Regula. The committee will be suspended for approximately 20 minutes. [Recess.] Mr. Regula. We will reconvene the committee. Our next witness is Dr. Charles Schuster, Professor of Psychiatry and Behavioral Neuroscience, Wayne State University College of Medicine. Welcome. ---------- Thursday, March 22, 2001. COLLEGE ON PROBLEMS OF DRUG DEPENDENCE, INC. WITNESS CHARLES R. SCHUSTER, PROFESSOR OF PSYCHIATRY AND BEHAVIORAL NEUROSCIENCE, WAYNE STATE UNIVERSITY SCHOOL OF MEDICINE Dr. Schuster. Thank you very much. First of all, let me ask permission to change my written testimony from ``good morning'' to ``good afternoon.'' Mr. Regula. Or ``good evening.'' Dr. Schuster. I am here today representing not only myself as a drug abuse research scientist and treatment provider, but as well I serve as the President of the College on Problems of Drug Dependence. The college has been in existence since 1929 and is the oldest and largest scientific society devoted to the study of addictions. It has over 600 members and about 1,000 people come to our annual scientific meeting. The membership is comprised of a broad array of scientists, from molecular biologists through criminologists, policy analysts, and sociologists, et cetera, concerned with the range of problems that drug abuse is involved with. I would like to first of all today, on behalf of the college, thank this committee for their support of the NIH in general in terms of the doubling of its budget, and specifically for its support of the National Institute on Drug Abuse and appeal to you for continuing this support for it obviously is one of the nation's most important problems. On the way here today I came across a recent report from Constant Horgan of Brandeis, which states that substance abuse, is the nation's top health problem, causing more deaths, illness and disabilities than any other preventable health problem today. I am not going to burden you with statistics about that because we are all aware of the tragedies associated with it. What I would like to say is that the National Institute on Drug Abuse is a governmental organization that is very important, not only to the members of the College, but as well to our society in general, because it supports the overwhelming majority of scientific research on the complex problems associated with drug abuse and dependence. This research has already paid off in a number of ways in terms of the development of effective prevention and treatment interventions, which are already being utilized. However, a great deal more is in the pipeline. We are at a time when advances are occurring very, very rapidly. In my written testimony I said that we were studying the long-term effects of methamphetamine or speed on the brain and that definitive evidence would be soon forthcoming. Well, in the weeks between the time I wrote this and the time I am coming here a report has come out definitely corroborating the fact that methamphetamine causes the same kind of brain damage in humans that has been reported in laboratory animals for many, many years. So, this is a very rapidly emerging field. My own group is now studying MDMA or Ecstasy in terms of the effects of it on the brain. One of the things we are very interested in and is of the utmost importance to us to understand if we are going to be able to effectively treat the problem of drug abuse is what happens in the brain when people move from casual, experimental drug use to regular drug use and finally to compulsive drug use, which is what characterizes addiction. What is going on in the brain there? We now have the techniques to PET scanning, functional MRI and magnetic resin spectroscopy to study these kinds of things in living human beings and animals. Rapid advances are being made in this area today. In addition, NIDA's research has been responsible for a variety of behavioral interventions to help people cope with the behavioral changes that they have to make when they transition from being active drug users to a drug abstinent state. These are very effective procedures that are now being utilized across the United States and I think are making a real difference. One of the areas that I am personally involved in that I think is very exciting is the so-called National Drug Abuse Treatment Clinical Trials network. This is a new program at NIDA, which is designed to bridge the gap between academicresearchers, which is myself, and community treatment programs. It is true in all branches of medicine that there is a gap, but it is particularly large in the area of the treatment of drug abuse. NIDA has now established a network of 14 regional training and research centers. These are academic centers spread out across the United States, each one of which has gone out into their community and established a collaborative relationship with community treatment programs where research has never gone on. Now, what we are doing is taking new treatment interventions which have been shown under rigidly controlled clinical trials to be effective or efficacious, as we call it. We are then looking at them in community treatment programs to find out if they are useful in the real world. If they are useful, how can we better get other community treatment programs that are not part of the CTN to adopt their use. This is the goal of this project. Although there are 14 of these centers around the United States linked up with about 100 treatment programs, I think the National Institute on Drug Abuse is very much interested in expanding this. Mr. Regula. Are all addictions centered in the brain? Dr. Schuster. Yes. Mr. Regula. What does the body do, send a message that they want to smoke or that they want a shot, to the brain? Dr. Schuster. The message begins in the brain. We have studies now in which we can take individuals who are chronic drug users, we put them into a machine called a Functional MRI and we provoke them to crave drugs by giving them cues that have in the past been associated with their drug use. We can delineate the regions of the brain that are activated when they see these cues and they report an overwhelming urge to get the drug. Mr. Regula. So, part of drug therapy would be to change patterns of the things that trigger? Dr. Schuster. Absolutely. This is can be done in a couple of ways. First of all, we are looking for medications that may decrease craving. We are also looking for behavioral and psychological interventions that may alter that. Great progress has really been made because we understand the mechanisms now. [The information follows:] [GRAPHIC(S) NOT AVAILABLE IN TIFF FORMAT] Mr. Regula. Very interesting. Mr. Kennedy. Mr. Kennedy. I wanted to get into the whole idea of this being behavioral and biological. We, obviously, need to fund more research in the area of how the genome and how we can intervene earlier. Because to wait until people get to be addicts is just a waste of time. I think it is probably very useful for us to advance the concept that the brain is part of the body and mental health is overall health so that we don't have insurance companies treating people differently for mental health issues that are chronic like drug and substance abuse any different from asthma or diabetes or anything like that. We need to get this bill passed in this Congress, hopefully the Domenici Parity Bill and the Roukema bill on this side will pass, because that is the best thing we can do in my view right now, to get more treatment to people out there. Dr. Schuster. I would also like to comment on the fact that one of the problems that we have with the treatment of drug addiction is the fact that many of the people that we see also have concomitant mental health problems, other psychiatric disorders. It is very common. Yet, because of the separation in the funding streams, it is oftentimes very difficult for us to provide both services in the same site. As a consequence of this, when you take somebody, as somebody said earlier today, they don't have a car. They have to take three buses. You refer them to a psychiatrist or a mental health clinic on the other side of town and they don't get there. We really have to work on trying to mainstream these so that we can provide these kinds of services in the same venue, so to speak. Mr. Kennedy. That is my point, Mr. Chairman, about the schools for the kids because it is a non-threatening environment. It is not some substance abuse treatment center, some mental health place that has all kinds of stigmas laden with it. You can treat people collocated. As you said, a lot of this is behavioral and it is mental health. We need to identify these kids who are predisposed, either through sociological factors, their parents, they have trouble at home, their parents are addicts or what have you, and address it early on. Mr. Regula. Thank you for coming. Dr. Schuster. Could I have ten seconds? Research has shown that if we could ensure the children learn to read in the first grade, if they become positively engaged in school that is the most effective prevention intervention we could have. Mr. Regula. Good point. We have the whole gamut here.Thank you. Mr. Steve Wilhide, President of the Southern Ohio Health Service Network. Thursday, March 22, 2001. NATIONAL ASSOCIATION OF COMMUNITY HEALTH CENTERS, INC. WITNESS STEVE WILHIDE, PRESIDENT, SOUTHERN OHIO HEALTH SERVICE NETWORK Mr. Wilhide. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. Mr. Chairman and members of the subcommittee, I want to thank you for the opportunity to be here today. I am President and CEO of the Southern Ohio Health Services Network, which is a rural community health center. I am speaking on behalf of the National Association of Community Health Centers regarding funding for the Consolidated Health Center Program within the Department of Health and Human Services. I would like to thank this committee for your increases that have enabled us to serve millions more people nationwide in our community health centers. We appreciate your commitment to this program and appreciate your consideration of expanding the program so we can serve millions more. Southern Ohio Health Services Network is a Federally supported community health center founded in 1976. I was brought there as the first Executive Director. Our first year's budget was $49,000. It was an Appalachian Regional Commission grant and $200,000 from the Department of Health and Human Services to provide direct care. Today, approaching our 25th anniversary, we have a budget of approximately $17,000,000 of which about 20 percent comes from a Federal grant and we serve approximately 50,000 people who had one or more visits for one or more services last year. We have over 50 physicians, dentists, nurse practitioners, social workers, and clinical psychologists. Mr. Regula. Do you have volunteers? Mr. Wilhide. We have volunteers. We have a volunteer physician who is retired that I met through my church who volunteers. We have a nurse who is retired and volunteers and we have a volunteer board that is very, very active. I will be getting back to my board meeting this afternoon. Nationwide, health centers serve 11 million people, 4.6 million of whom have no health insurance. We applaud President Bush's call to double the number of patients served by health centers and to double the number of sites. We would urge Congress to appropriate $175,000,000 more in order to achieve that goal. I think it is important to understand that community health centers are locally controlled and operated entities. The boards of those health centers, the majority of whom are consumers of the care, determine what health care needs are prioritized and then hold me accountable for reporting back to them as to what progress we are making toward clinical outcome goals. So, the board, each year, sets forth a list of clinical priorities, whether they want to decrease the risk of diabetics who have foot problems or what have you. We report to the board on our progress. Back in 1977 and 1978 two of our counties had the highest infant mortality rates in the State of Ohio, higher than many Third World countries. The board felt this was unacceptable. We targeted that program. We were able to receive a Maternal and Child Health grant in addition to our Federal dollars and other dollars. We worked with the entire community, public health departments, and community action programs with outreach, the Grads Program which targets pregnant teenagers to keep them in school. Mr. Regula. Did that include nutrition help? Mr. Wilhide. Absolutely. We also have the WIC Program that we operate. We were able to integrate all these services into one comprehensive approach. Because as many people have indicated before, it is not a medical problem, it is not a psychological problem, it is total integration that makes up the human being. So, we actually were able to recruit, through the National Service Corps, and we would not have gotten these doctors had we not, pediatricians and obstetricians, gynecologists. The first pediatrician ever to serve in Brown County just retired a few months ago. I am please to report today that our infant mortality rates are below State average in those two counties and 82 percent of women are getting first trimester prenatal care compared to about 58 percent before we started the campaign. Again, it was a combination of education, nutrition, socialwork, and psychology, integrated together into one setting. In addition to being responsive to local health care needs, community health centers have proven to be effective and efficient over the years. They provide their comprehensive services at an average cost of about $350 per person per year. That is obviously less than $1 per person served. They are having many studies to show their cost effectiveness in reducing hospitalization, reducing unnecessary emergency room utilization, higher child immunizations. My own program has a 93 percent immunization rate of two-year-olds. That is considerably above the State average. So, again, I think we are not a medical model. We are a comprehensive model with a variety of services based upon the needs of our own individual communities. Last year the National Association of Community Health Centers surveyed 100 health centers and found that those health centers could serve 50 percent more people if funding was available. In order to do this we are going to have to establish new sites in new locations and expand existing services in present locations. By way of example, in Adams County, which you may not be familiar with, which fortunately now is only the second poorest county in the State, I think Perry County is first; we opened a 23,500 square foot mall-type service facility and closed two aging facilities that were inadequate. We have in that facility the only psychiatrist in the county, a clinical pharmacy, internal medicine, the WIC Program, social work. There is a significant increase in the numbers of elderly served and dental. We have gone from three dental operatories to nine and the appointment books are full right now. [The information follows:] [GRAPHIC(S) NOT AVAILABLE IN TIFF FORMAT] Mr. Regula. I am sure they are. Thank you for coming. I think those community health centers do great work. Mr. Donald Price, President of the Society for Neuroscience. ---------- Thursday, March 22, 2001. SOCIETY FOR NEUROSCIENCE WITNESS DONALD L. PRICE, PRESIDENT Dr. Price. Good afternoon. My name is Don Price. I am a Professor of Neurology, Pathology and Neuroscience at Johns Hopkins and present President of the Society for Neuroscience. The Society for Neuroscience has about 28,000 members and its major commitment is to basic and clinical neuroscience. We are obviously very grateful for the support that we have gotten in the past and that biomedical research has gotten in the possibility. So, with that as a background, I want to depart from those remarks and give you an example of a human disease where really extraordinary progress has been made. That is Alzheimer's disease, which is the most common cause of dementia in late life. I think we are now on the threshold of coming up with therapeutic targets which could prevent this disease. What I would like to do, because you heard for example, an elegant discussion of the problem of rats. I would like to explain how that happens. The first thing that happened with Alzheimer's was to define it as a disease. The second thing was to look at the brain and find that there were very unusual deposits called ambyloid in the brain tissue. Then, the gene that encoded the protein that gave rise to ambyloid was identified. It turns out that it was like this pen. It is a protein thatlooks like this and the ambyloid component is imbedded in it. So, somehow abnormal scissors, enzymes, leave that peptide out and it becomes deposited in the brain of an Alzheimer's patient and causes the disease. Over the past few years we have identified mutations in that gene that are linked to the human disease. I brought two specimens, one from my grandson and the other from my administrative assistant. It is not hard to tell which is the Alzheimer mouse versus the other. But basically, what you can do is you can take the mutant human gene, put it in the mouse and the mouse will come up with the disease. It is now possible to use these mutant mice to test mechanisms and therapies. It represents the kind of advance that I think we are going to see over the next decade for Parkinson's disease, for Rett syndrome where the gene has now been identified, and so forth. It really represents an extraordinary step forward in terms of trying to treat disorders which, when I was neurology resident and a clinician, one really didn't want to diagnose because the news was so bad for the family. It is now possible to knock out the genes that make these scissor-like clips. It turns out when you knock those genes out in mice, the mice look perfectly well. What that tells you is that you could then give this mouse an inhibitor of that cleavage product, that enzyme, and this would not happen. The mouse would not get Alzheimer's disease. If it works in mice, it should work in humans. To emphasize the point that was made before about prevention, if one comes up with a small molecule that can get into the brain that can inhibit these enzyme activities that cleave this ambyloid protein, one could potentially completely prevent a disease like Alzheimer's. I think the same story is going to be translated to Lou Gehrig's disease and many of the other devastating neurological diseases. When genes are identified for psychiatric diseases, we are going to be able to do the same kinds of things. So, really, that is how the NIH monies are being invested. I think they are critical if we are going to improve the health of our population. Thank you very much. [The information follows:] [GRAPHIC(S) NOT AVAILABLE IN TIFF FORMAT] Mr. Regula. Thank you. Are there questions? I have just one. Does Alzheimer's have a pattern of onset that you would start this treatment once you identified it? You would not do it in a healthy person, I assume. Dr. Price. No. I think it would depend. I mean Alzheimer's disease clearly starts much earlier than the first obvious clinical sign. If you had a very safe drug, you could start it early. The earliest case of Alzheimer's that I know of is a young person who had a gene lesion who got it at 16 years of age. So, it can occur from 16 to late 80s. But it usually has a very indolent course. So, to answer your question directly, if you had a safe therapy, then one might treat patients prospectively. Mr. Regula. I understand there is some genetic pattern, that it is inherited. Dr. Price. That is right. It is really the identification of those genes that has allowed this kind of research to go forward. That is what we are going to see, I think, in psychiatry in the next decade. Mr. Regula. Well, thank you for coming. Dr. Price. Thanks very much. Mr. Regula. Dr. Robert Felter, Chairman of Pediatrics and Medical Director, Tod Children's Hospital in Youngstown. I am happy to welcome you. ---------- Thursday, March 22, 2001. NATIONAL ASSOCIATION OF CHILDREN'S HOSPITALS WITNESS ROBERT A. FELTER, CHAIRMAN OF PEDIATRICS AND MEDICAL DIRECTOR, TOD CHILDREN'S HOSPITAL, YOUNGSTOWN, OHIO Dr. Felter. Good afternoon. My name is Robert Felter. I am a pediatric emergency physician and currently Chairman of Pediatrics and Medical Director of Tod Children's Hospital in Youngstown, Ohio. Thank you for the opportunity to testify on behalf of the National Association of Children's Hospitals. Mr. Chairman, I especially want to thank you and the members of your committee and your colleagues very much for last year's appropriation off $235,000,000 for Graduate Medical Education or GME Programs for the nation's nearly 60 pediatric teaching hospitals. You enacted this funding at a time when it was critically needed by hospitals all across the country. Your 2001 appropriation is a major step toward fulfilling the Congress's authorization of the $285,000,000 needed to provide equitable Federal support for our GME Programs. In today's increasingly price competitive health care marketplace, Medicare has become the only major reliable source of GME support. Teaching hospitals absolutely rely on it to remain competitive. But children's hospitals qualify for virtually no Federal GME support from Medicare because we care for children. On the average, one of our hospitals receives less than one half of one percent of the GME support which other teaching hospitals receive through Medicare. That creates a huge gap in Federal support for children's hospitals. According to the Lewin Group, it amounts to about $285,000,000 annually. It puts at risk not only our hospitals, but also the future of our entire pediatric workforce and health care for all children. Here is why: On the average our hospitals consist of less than one percent of all hospitals, but we train nearly 30 percent of all pediatricians, nearly 50 percent of all pediatric specialists and almost all pediatric emergency specialists such as myself. We are also the major pipeline for future pediatric research. We also serve all children, regardless of economic need, from the furthest rural to the nearest inner city neighborhoods. We provide personal, compassionate care combined with state-of-the-art medical treatment. Mr. Chairman, as we discussed in your office last week, you know that this affects my own hospital very much. We provide more than 30 pediatric sub-specialists and highly specialized programs such as our pediatric in-patient cancer unit. We serve all children. More than 60 percent of our care at Tod Children's goes to children who are assisted by Medicaid or have no insurance. We also train 27 medical residents each year. The majority of them go into practice in the Youngstown area or in Ohio. Mr. Regula. You got some financial support for that program out of this committee this current year; right? Dr. Felter. Yes, we got $200,000 for Tod and we will get a little over $1,000,000 this year from the increased finances. Again, it costs us about $200,000,000. As you know, Youngstown is an economically depressed community, which makes it difficult for us to attract and retain strong clinical talent. The loss of our GME Program would seriously affect Youngstown's pediatric workforce. We face the potential for that loss right now. We spend more than $2,000,000, our hospital does, just on the direct cost of the program. We face increasing pressures to eliminate either that training program or other programs. Frankly, without strong Federal funding through Children's Hospital GME program, the future of our training program is in jeopardy. That in turn puts into jeopardy the long-term future of our children's hospital and the health of our community. With such a major impact on small institutions such as Tod Children's Hospital, you can image the impact of this funding on much larger institutions in their regions such as Children's Hospital in Boston or Los Angeles, which train hundreds of residents. Please take the next step to close the gap by appropriating full funding this year. It is vital for the future of our pediatric workforce and the healthcare of all children. Thank you again for your past support. We appreciate very much your consideration of our request today for fulfillment of equitable GME support for children's hospitals. [The information follows:] Mr. Peterson [assuming chair]. I didn't really hear most of your testimony, but I didn't really need to. I am very familiar with Pennsylvania's Pittsburgh Children's Hospital and CHOP in Philadelphia. I call them miracle hospitals, because that is really what you do. We send our very sickest children to you and you do miracles. I totally support, personally, and I am just speaking for one person, of closing that gap. If there is any part of our teaching system that should not have been shortchanged, it is our kids. Dr. Felter. Thank you very much. I appreciate the support. Mr. Peterson. Are there any questions? Thank you very much. Next we will hear from Stephen Bartels, President of the American Association for Geriatric Psychiatry. We welcome you. Please proceed. ---------- Thursday, March 22, 2001. AMERICAN ASSOCIATION FOR GERIATRIC PSYCHIATRY WITNESS STEPHEN BARTELS, PRESIDENT Dr. Bartels. Mr. Chairman and members of the subcommittee I am Dr. Stephen Bartels, President of the American Association for Geriatric Psychiatry. AAGP is a professional membership organization dedicated to promoting the mental health and well being of older Americans and improving the care of those with late life mental disorders. Mr. Chairman, I join many of those other witnesses here today in thanking the subcommittee for its continued strong support for increased funding for the National Institutes of Health over the last several years. However, I am here today to convey the serious concern shared by researchers, clinicians and consumers that there exists a critical disparity between Federally funded research on mental health and aging and mental health needs of older Americans. Mr. Chairman, as we have already heard today, the U.S. Census projects that numbers of Americans over age 65 will increase dramatically over the coming decades. However, despite recent significant increases in appropriations for research in mental health, the proportion of new NIH funds for research on older persons has actually gone down and is woefully inadequate to deal with the impending crisis of mental health in older Americans. With the Baby Boom generation nearing retirement, the number of older Americans experiencing mental health problems is certain to increase in the future. By the year 2010, there will be approximately 40 million people in the United States over the age of 65. Over 20 percent of those people will experience mental disorders. Current and projected economic costs of mental disorders of aging alone are staggering. Depression is an example of a common problem among older persons. Approximately 30 percent of older persons in primary care settings have significant symptoms of depression. Depression is associated with greater health care costs, poor health care outcomes and increased morbidity and mortality. Older adults have the highest suicide rate of any age group. AAGP would like to call to the subcommittee's attention the fact that recent increases in the National Institute of Mental Health and the Center for Mental Health Services have not been reflected in new research funding on mental health in aging. For example, while total research grants awarded by NIMH increased 59 percent in 1995 to the year 2000, NIMH grants for aging research increased at half that rate over the same period. In fact, between 1999 into the year 2000, the actual amount of new funding for aging grants by NIMH declined. I brought this diagram here to show that the proportion of total NIMH newly funded research devoted to aging declined from an average of eight percent in 1995 down to six percent in the year 2000. It is juxtaposed against significant increases that this committee has approved for NIMH over the last several years. I have also taken the liberty to bring this other diagram that shows the increasing numbers of people who are elderly that are projected to come, the associated health care expenditures. This large increase is showing the number of people with mental disorders as opposed to younger people and this is the NIMH funded research at the current rate, which is quite low. Now, Mr. Chairman, the research that this committee has funded shows definitely that treatment works for many mental health problems in older persons. However, if current trends in funding for aging and mental health continue at NIMH and CMHS, we will dramatically fall short of the need for continued developments and our understanding of the causes of mental health problems in older people and the development of effective prevention and treatment. Improving the treatment of late life mental problems will benefit not only the elderly, but also the current Baby Boomer generation whose lives are often profoundly affected by those of their parents who comprise an unprecedented challenge to the future of mental health services in America. In short, Mr. Chairman, this is not simply a concern for our nation's elderly. Under-funding research on mental health in aging is a problem for those of us with parents afflicted with mental disorders and for the future of those of us who will reach retirement age in the next two decades. Based on our assessment of the current need and future challenges of late life mental disorders, we submit the following three recommendations for consideration: One, the current rate of funding for aging grants at NIMH and CMHS is inadequate. Funding of aging research grants by these agencies should be increased by approximately three times the current funding level, to be commensurate with the current need. Two, infrastructures within NIMH and CMHS are needed to support the development of initiatives in aging research, including the creating of positions with these agencies dedicated to promoting, maintaining and monitoring research on mental health in aging. Three, the establishment of grant review committees with specific expertise in reviewing research proposals on mental health in aging. In conclusion, we are dramatically under-investing in research on mental health in aging at a time when the NIMH and CMHS budgets have seen significant increases. The projected economic impact of the aging Baby Boom generation on Medicare and Social Security systems is well known. But there is another challenge that has not received attention. We can expect an unprecedented explosion in the number of people over age 65 with potentially disabling mental disorders. I would like to thank you for allowing me to submit this testimony today. We will be happy to answer any questions. Mr. Peterson. In your research, are you tracking some of the mental health drugs that our seniors have been on for decades? Dr. Bartels. Yes. Mr. Peterson. I would like to just raise one. I have a personal experience. My mother had depression problems all of her life. I don't remember when she would not go into the lows and the highs. She was never doctored until the last two or three decades. I do not think we doctored it much when I was a child. But she was on a drug called Vivactil for maybe 25 or 30 years. I had a younger brother who over a period of time had to get the doctors that prescribed that to reconsider that drug. He had done some research. He was always unsuccessful. I guess I kind of hold myself responsible that I didn't give him more assistance, but I certainly didn't hamper him. Recently, she had a health problem where she broke her hip and was temporarily in a nursing home for rehab. The doctor there quickly agreed with my brother that she ought to be off that drug. My mother could not carry on a conversation with me for three years. My mother can carry unlimited conversation today after six months. I just find that a tragedy that she was deprived of the ability to communicate. She knew my name. She always knew me. She expressed love for her children, but she could not communicate. She is actually gaining. We were blaming it all on Alzheimer's. She is actually gaining the ability to have a conversation with her children. In discussing this with nurses, they feel there are a number of mental health drugs over long periods of time that have actually harmed people's ability to think and carry on a conversation. Do we monitor them long term? Dr. Bartels. Well, not well enough. I think part of that has to do with health services research in pharmacoepidemiology and look at precisely this: co-prescriptions, old medications that have bad side effects that do impair cognition. The good news is that there are new medications which have minimal side effects that enhance functioning. We know, for example, like your mother had a hip fracture, that untreated depression actually results in worse health care outcomes. Those people do not get better as fast and they are more likely to die. So, untreated depression, untreated disorders without the state-of-the-art medications is actually a tragedy. Mr. Peterson. Well, I guess in Pennsylvania where they had the PACE Program where they really know what everybody is on and she was in the PACE Program. I have been going to talk to them because I have worked with them for years at the State level. How many people are still on that drug? I personal think it is a bad drug. Dr. Bartels. I think there are newer and better drugs that are out there and that is part of the research that we are hoping to focus on, looks at those medications, treatment and services that will make a difference for people like your mother. Mr. Peterson. Of course, I am one who thinks we rely too much on drugs today. There are wonderful drugs. I am not against new drugs. Dr. Bartels. There are very effective non-pharmacologic interventions also that we are doing research on. Mr. Peterson. There are so many seniors. I tour home health agencies. Five, six, seven, eight, nine or ten drugs, I am just amazed how many drugs our seniors are on and the complications of them. Are we studying that, too? Dr. Bartels. We are. Our group at Dartmouth is doing just those sorts of studies right now. Mr. Peterson. Do you have any questions? The gentleman from Rhode Island. Mr. Kennedy. I agree, Mr. Chairman. The fact of the matter is seniors are over-utilizing the health care system for many reasons, because they are depressed or they are not getting connections. So, they use the Medicare system as a way to get, you know, some attention and whatever that makes up for lack of proper love and so forth from their family or the losses that they have suffered. If you would establish a kind of program that was a practicum of how to identify depression among seniors, I mean if you had limited resources and I am not talking about the research angle and increasing science, which I agree with you on, but just out there right now, what would be your kind of vision of what a program would look like? Dr. Bartels. I think there are several things. First of all, you are exactly right that we know from health services research that there is increased health services utilization, emergency room visits, hospitalizations, et cetera, with untreated depression. I think the place to go is where seniors are, which is to say that because of the stigma of mental illness, they are less likely to go to specialty care providers. So that primary care physician offices, educating primary care physicians to better identify and use state-of-the-art treatments is a place to go, senior citizens centers as well as senior housing. Some of the innovative programs that we have actually looked at and a number of us have researched, I think, are the places to look at. Mr. Kennedy. I would love to have you share what some of your findings have been in those areas because I would like to get those things back in my community because I know there are too many seniors who are suffering needlessly. People think, oh, that is just part of being old. Dr. Bartels. I would be delighted to talk with you in details about some of these programs. Mr. Kennedy. That would be great. Thanks very much. Mr. Peterson. Thank you. We are trying to accommodate people who have plane reservation problems. We are next going to hear from Dr. Felix Okojie, Vice President, Research and Strategic Initiatives, Jackson State University. If you have a similar problem, let us know. We will try to accommodate you. Please proceed. [GRAPHIC(S) NOT AVAILABLE IN TIFF FORMAT] Thursday, March 22, 2001. JACKSON STATE UNIVERSITY WITNESS FELIX OKOJIE, VICE PRESIDENT, RESEARCH AND STRATEGIC INITIATIVES Dr. Okojie. Mr. Chairman, distinguished members of the subcommittee, I am Felix Okojie, Vice President for Research and Strategic Initiatives at Jackson State University. I want to thank you members of the committee for giving me the opportunity to appear before you today as you consider the fiscal year 2002 funding year priorities for this subcommittee. First of all, I would like to be on record with this committee for the extraordinary and strategic efforts for putting significant amounts of dollars in agencies like NIH and the education in that has helped historically Black colleges and universities across this country to contribute significantly to the health and other problems of the citizens of this country. As a result of the efforts of this committee, I would like to speak very briefly to how Jackson State University in Jackson, Mississippi has benefitted and continues to benefit from the efforts of this committee. There are two initiatives that the university is very much interested in that we think, because of the resources that have already been invested at the university by Federal agencies as a result of the appropriations from this committee, can even further enhance the critical goal that we have. There is a study going on right now in Jackson called The Jackson House Study, which is an epidemiological, cardiovascular disease study by the largest CVD study for African-Americans in this country. Within that we also have a major cancer study going on at the medical school. Jackson State University recently developed an epidemiological institute where CVD and things like prostate cancer will be the major focus. Jackson State University is at the forefront in trying to help to meet some of the disparity, particularly in the area of cities in Mississippi and this country. One of the initiatives we would like to highlight is the establishment of a minority Rural and Urban Health and Wellness Center. The impetus for this center is as a result of the critical mass of the human resource and intellectual capital that has been harnessed over the years to do a lot of disparity studies in collaboration with institutes like NIH and CDC. Information out of these studies can be disseminated both in the rural and urban areas of the State as well as across different parts of this country. So, the Health and Wellness Center would take advantage of this synergy and the intellectual capital to capitalize and to disseminate significant information on both disparities as it relates to those common issues that afflict minority populations in Mississippi and in other parts of this country. I ask this committee that sufficient funding be provided in the health facilities account of the HHS section of the Education Appropriations bill to support projects such as this that Jackson State is proposing. The other major project is a project called the Mississippi e-Center at Jackson State University. This is a center that we would like the committee to be aware of. Again, this center is designed to create some more outreach efforts through the use of technology to reach urban and rural areas in Mississippi, as well as providing some new and innovative ideas that can help service some of the needs across this country by using research, e-technology programming and e-service opportunities to meet the needs of minorities in this country as well as major aspects of people in this country. Mr. Chairman, thank you for this opportunity. I will take any questions. [The information follows:] [GRAPHIC(S) NOT AVAILABLE IN TIFF FORMAT] Mr. Peterson. Thank you very much. I guess we have no questions. Next, we will call on Dorothy Hill, President of the American Psychiatric Nurses Association. Please proceed. ---------- Thursday, March 22, 2001. AMERICAN PSYCHIATRIC NURSES ASSOCIATION WITNESS DOROTHY HILL, PRESIDENT Ms. Hill. Mr. Chairman, my name is Dottie Hill and I am Vice President of Patient Care at Arcadia Hospital in Bangor, Maine. I am here today as President of the American Psychiatric Nurses Association, or APNA. Thank you for providing me with the opportunity to outline APNA's funding priorities for fiscal year 2002. Founded in 1987, APNA is comprised of approximately 4,000 psychiatric nurses representing every State in the nation. Our mission is to advance psychiatric and mental health nursing practice, improve mental health care for culturally diverse individuals, families, groups and communities and to help shape mental health care policy. Before moving on, I would like to quickly review some startling statistics to demonstrate the impact mental illness has on our country. One out of every five children has a mental health disorder. Two-thirds of our nation's seniors living in nursing homes have a mental health disorder. Although 80 percent of those with depression can be effectively treated, only one out of three receives appropriate treatment. The economic burden related to mental illness is staggering with the total estimated cost for mental health disorders in 1994 at approximately $204,000,000,000. I would like to reiterate that mental illnesses are biological, medical illnesses. First APNA is seeking increased Federal support for psychiatric nursing research. Psychiatric nurses have been and will continue to be an integral part of our nation's research community. With this in mind, APNA would like to commend this subcommittee and in particular, Congresswoman DeLauro for the fiscal year 2001 appropriations measure that led to a joint NINR and NIH mentorship program for psychiatric nurse researchers. The program will support the development of expert psychiatric mental health nurse researchers in the area of measuring outcomes in the care of psychiatric patients. APNA is extremely excited about this program and wishes to acknowledge the tremendous work done by Dr. Patricia Grady, Director of NINR, and Dr. Steven Hyman, Director of NIMH, and the staff at both institutions. In addition to supporting the nurse researcher mentorship program, strong Federal support is needed in order to build our nation's research capacity by ensuring an adequate supply of nurse researchers. As a result, we would ask the committee to include nurse researchers in any research-related loan repayment program so that we can attract the most promising students into psychiatric nursing research. We would also like to take a moment to note our concern that current NIH and NINR funding does not fully reflect the broad range of psychiatric nursing research. With the grant funding focused on issues such as violence and substance abuse, while these issues are very important, we would like to extend this research portfolio. In all, APNA is seeking $144,000,000 for NINR and at least a 16.5 percent increase for NIMH. APNA's second priority relates to the nursing shortage our country now faces. I am sure you folks have heard a lot about that. In order to address this serious problem, APNA and other members of the health professions and nursing education coalition recommend at least $440,000,000 in fiscal year 2002 overall funding for Title VII and Title VIII of the Public Health Service Act. These figures do not include funding for the children's hospitals Graduate Medical Education Program, an amount separate from Title VII and Title VIII funding. Within the health professions programs, APNA is joined by other members of the nursing community in seeking a minimum increase of $25,000,000 within Title VIII. Further, we are seeking an additional $10,000,000 for 2002 for the Nursing Education Loan Repayment Program. Equally important, APNA is advocating for an improved data collection to learn even more about our nursing workforce. Finally, APNA would like to ask for the committee's helpto ensure that recent reforms related to the use of seclusion and restraint include the expertise of our nation's psychiatric nurses. We are concerned that new policies could overlook our nation's psychiatric nurses in a way that could negatively impact patient and staff safety. Safety in nursing work environments is crucial with the impending nursing shortage. Thank you very much for providing me with the opportunity to present our funding priorities. I would be happy to answer any questions. [The information follows:] [GRAPHIC(S) NOT AVAILABLE IN TIFF FORMAT] Mr. Peterson. The last county medical society that I met with shared with me that 40 to 50 percent of their patients needed mental health treatment. That has not been historic; has it? Ms. Hill. It actually has been historic, but I don't think we have discovered or admitted or understood that until more recently with some of the advances that we are finding, that people have described before this community in terms of being able to look in people's brains and understanding that many of what we heretofore thought were maybe disorders of aging or just adulthood or disorders related to stress actually had a biological and medical basis. The more we understand that, the more we are beginning to diagnose and hopefully treat those illnesses. Mr. Peterson. But you don't think that is an uncommon figure? Ms. Hill. No, I do not. Mr. Peterson. Do psych nurses basically work in psych units? I have a lot of small rural hospitals. They don't all have psych units. But if they don't have a psych unit, would they hire a psychiatric nurse? Ms. Hill. Eighty percent of our psychiatric nurses are functioning in hospitals, but not in small rural hospitals. If there is not a psychiatric unit in a hospital, it would be very hard to find a psychiatric nurse. Mr. Peterson. They are basically in where the units are? Ms. Hill. Right. Mr. Peterson. You kept using the term ``mental health nursing research.'' I don't quite understand that term. Ms. Hill. Well, in the past most of the nursing research that has been done has not been funded. Psychiatric nursing, mental health nursing research has not been funded or it has been under-funded. We have had some great success in the last year getting some dollars put towards nursing research for psychiatric nursing. That is what we are asking about. Much of the funding has gone to much broader nursing research that does not relate to psychiatry. Mr. Peterson. Is that separated from psychiatric research in general? I guess that is the question maybe I should have asked. Why is it separate who the provider is, whether it is a nurse or a doctor? Ms. Hill. Again, nursing research has a specific body of knowledge all its own which relates to how patient care influences how patient care influences people to get better. It is a different science. Mr. Peterson. Do you think we need to get a little bit drastic, maybe, in our future budgets about dealing with the nursing shortage in general, beyond psychiatric, I mean just in general. Are we approaching, in your view, a huge crisis? Ms. Hill. A drastic crisis. Mr. Peterson. I have young nurses in my district, who, now that we are basically Bachelor's degree nurses, who found that they can go to school one more year and be anything they want. That is a foundation for other careers. So, what we thought was maybe the right direction now allows them to just move on. Several are going to be accountants, CPAs. That is not exactly what you would think a nurse would go to. But because of what they found on the floor in their first two or three years in practice, they are just moving on. They are going to night school and they are going to move on and leave the nursing profession. If it is like that across the country, we are really in trouble. Ms. Hill. That is right. Mr. Peterson. We are always looking for projects or pilots that we can do across this country. I think we really need to put our thinking caps on to discover how we can get people into nursing quickly. Ms. Hill. I agree. Mr. Peterson. I look forward to your advice. Ms. Hill. Thank you. Mr. Peterson. Dr. Robert Schwartz, Professor and Chairman, Department of Family Medicine and Community Health, University of Miami, School of Medicine. Good afternoon and welcome. ---------- Thursday, March 22, 2001. ORGANIZATIONS OF ACADEMIC FAMILY MEDICINE WITNESS ROBERT SCHWARTZ, PROFESSOR AND CHAIR, DEPARTMENT OF FAMILY MEDICINE AND COMMUNITY HEALTH, UNIVERSITY OF MIAMI SCHOOL OF MEDICINE Dr. Schwartz. Thank you. It is an honor and a privilege to be here. As you mentioned, I am Professor and Chair of the Department of Family Medicine and Community Health at the University of Miami School of Medicine. I am also a member of the board and legislative chair of the Society of Teachers of Family Medicine. I have been a practicing physician and teacher for more than 20 years. I thank you for the opportunity to be able to talk on behalf of the organizations of academic family medicine today. I am here to discuss two programs under the purview of this committee: The Family Practice Training Programs under Title VII of the Health Services Act; and the Agency for Health Care Research and Quality, also known as AHRQ. Both of these programs address real and important needs in our society. These programs are not sexy. They do not have a natural and sympathetic constituency. What they do have is a proven ability to make positive changes in our nation's health care and in our patient's lives. These are programs this committee supported well in the last funding cycle. We are asking for that support again this year. We ask in addition that the funding for the Primary Care Medicine and Dentistry Cluster of Title VII be increased $158,000,000. This would allow for $96,000,000 for family practice training programs. Currently, the Federally funded educational system reinforces the sub-specialization of the physician workforce. The President's budget blueprint says that the nation has too many doctors. We respectfully disagree. What we are experiencing is a surplus of specialists. We do have a shortage of doctors, primary care physicians and doctors who care for families. Title VII programs are designed to counter this market bias and support development of the primary care physician workforce. These are the only Federal programs that explicitly fund the infrastructure to produce physicians who will address Congressional stipulated goals. They will help deliver health care to under-served populations. They will bring health care professionals to rural areas and will improve geographic mal- distribution of the physician workforce. We are excited because now we have new data. Federal funding through Title VII of Family Medicine Department's pre- doctoral programs and faculty development has made a difference. A current study shows that these three types of grants really do make a difference in producing more family physicians and more primary care doctors. Pre-doctoral and department development grants made a difference in producing more primary care doctors serving in rural areas and more doctors serving in primary care health professional areas, also known as HPSAs. Sustained funding during the years of medical school training had more positive impact than intermittent funding. Another recent study data show that without family physicians over 1,000 additional counties would qualify for this designation as a HPSA. This compares to an additional 176 counties that would meet the criteria if all internists, pediatricians and obstetricians in aggregate were withdrawn. These funds must be maintained and increased to help our nation's service needs. I would like to share one of the main success stories created by Title VII funding. Dr. Joyce Lawrence is a young African-American woman who grew up in Liberty City, one of the poorest communities in South Florida and even in the country. She was able to gain entrance to the University of Arizona School of Medicine and early in her training was exposed to a Title VII-funded pre-doctoral family medicine. This had an enormous impact on her future. Dr. Lawrence graduated, returned to Miami, determined that she was going to do something for the community in which she grew up. She gained a position in our residency program, supported through the years again by Title VII dollars and successfully completed her three-year post-graduate training. Dr. Lawrence was recently hired as the medical director for a privately-funded school health initiative to put health care back into the Miami-Dade County school system, one of the largest public school systems in the country, one with limited health care access for its predominately minority and under- served community. This is a real success story, but only one of many made possible by sustained Title VII funding for academic family medicine in the country. Mr. Chairman, the other program I am testifying on today is funding for AHRQ. We also appreciate the increased funding provided this past year. However, we support a budget allocation of $400,000,000 for fiscal year 2002. This includes funding for patient safety, translating research into practice, outcomes research and 350 new investigator-initiated grants. Why? Just like Title VII programs, the research conducted through AHRQ is critical to responding to national health care needs. While our country has dramatically increased investment in basic medical science research through NIH programs, there has been little support to answer questions of major concern to many America's and their family physicians. Nor has there been adequate effort to develop the clinical applications in primary care from this new basic science knowledge. We applaud the investment in NIH, but we feel strongly that an increase in funding for AHRQ will dramatically enhance the ability of the recent resources to maximize research in primary care. As a practicing family doctor, I need to know how the rapid advances in new pharmacological products, information, technology, gene therapy, and diagnostic techniques are applicable to the care of my patients. In addition, we need to know the risks of these new treatments and techniques. AHRQ is the only Federal agency to support this. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. [The information follows:] [GRAPHIC(S) NOT AVAILABLE IN TIFF FORMAT] Mr. Peterson. Thank you, Dr. Schwartz. Let me ask the first question. What do you consider primary care? Dr. Schwartz. Well, that is a good question and obviously, it is a controversial one. Mr. Peterson. It shouldn't be. Dr. Schwartz. It shouldn't be. A family doctor is a physician who has been trained to take care of the entire family. They do pediatrics. They do adult medicine. Many of them still do obstetrics and gynecology. They specialize in geriatrics. Behavioral medicine is a very important component of the family medicine programs. It is really the broadest physician that exists in the United States and it is the perfect physician for rural areas and urban centers. The interesting thing is that the majority of the care to poor and minority populations, the under-served, takes place in academic or residency training programs throughout the country. Mr. Peterson. I always considered family physicians internists. OB-GYN, I know that is one lot, too. But I don't understand it because OB-GYNs are many women's primary doctor. And you mentioned pediatrician. Who should I have included in that? Anybody else? Dr. Schwartz. Primary care is usually all of those that you mentioned. But family physicians consider themselves the real primary care physician because we really do the broad range of services where many families go to one physician and then, if they have a problem, they are referred to somebody else and a third and a fourth. One of the things that we hold up most importantly is continuity of care, seeing the same physician year after year, understanding patient's problems and understanding them within the context of family. Those are some of the things that unfortunately modern medicine has pushed aside. We have really created so many sub-specialties, I hear all the time of people being grateful for having a family physician who really knows the entire family. Mr. Peterson. In the rural setting, if I did not look at their license, I would not know an internist from a family physician because they practice almost the same. Most people don't know the difference. Dr. Schwartz. No. That is true. Mr. Peterson. Where are we at today in the percentage coming through the primary care specialty? Do you know what the numbers are nationally? I don't. Dr. Schwartz. Well, you are going to hear in the news very soon that today was the match results and unfortunately family medicine training programs did not do as well as they have done in the past. That is a significant problem. It has improved dramatically in the last decade, but as has been mentioned today, there are many pressures that push students into sub- specialty medicine. Salaries are much higher in diagnostic radiology. Loan repayment is an enormous issue. Students are coming out with $90,000 or $100,000 indebtedness. Those are clearly forces that push people away from doing family medicine. Mr. Peterson. A decade or more ago in State government I chaired health and welfare. I got the attention of our nine medical schools by proposing legislation that would have made those who go into primary care residencies less costly than those who chose the other. The medical schools were all in my office within a week discussing this issue. Now, what I was able to do was-we changed the numbers in Pennsylvania. I have not watched them since I left five years ago. But we changed the numbers and primary care residencies grew in Pennsylvania because of that action and that fear that we were going to do something to penalize them. Of course, some of the bigger schools went back into primary care because they needed the doctors themselves, just to fill their own slots. Now, I guess I would be for loading some incentives. We have to somehow change this. Everett Koop was the one who brought me to the issue years ago. We don't have that kind of a voice any more. He talked about this issue a lot. I don't think people realize where we are headed. Dr. Schwartz. I think you are right. I think it is an extraordinary problem in terms of people understanding that primary care physicians are essential in health care. Many of the problems that were discussed today in terms of the research, et cetera, can only really be handled on the front line. There is less hospitalization than ever before because of the cost of hospitalization. Well, where is that care going to take place but in the community? You also mentioned the issue of medications. I feel very strongly that our communities and patients are over-medicated. One of the reasons we need money in AHRQ is because outcomes research needs to occur in the community. A lot of the things that we empirically know as physicians need resources to be funded. Mr. Peterson. Come to me privately with you are ideas about what we talked about. We are running short of time here today. I would love to talk to you for an hour. Sometime contact me, I will be glad to work with you. Dr. Schwartz. Thank you very much, sir. Mr. Peterson. Next, we are going to hear out of order Patricia Underwood, the First Vice President of the American Nurses Association. If you have a flight problem, let us know. Welcome. Please proceed. ---------- Thursday, March 22, 2001. AMERICAN NURSES ASSOCIATION WITNESS PATRICIA W. UNDERWOOD, FIRST VICE-PRESIDENT Ms. Underwood. Good afternoon. Mr. Chairman and members of the subcommittee, I am Patricia Underwood, the First Vice President of the American Nurses Association, the only full service professional organization representing the nation's 2.7 million registered nurses. This afternoon I will address funding for nursing education and research. The American Nurses Association believes that our shared goal of ensuring the nation of an adequate supply of well-educated nurses will reaffirm the need for increasing funding for these programs. Mr. Chairman, as you know, there is a shortage of nurses, particularly due to a mal-distribution of nurses and their unwillingness to work in dissatisfying and unsafe environments. An even more critical shortage of nurses is coming due to a lack of young people entering the nursing profession. Due to an aging workforce, the average age of the working nurse is 43.3 years, and also due to nurses leaving the profession because of increasingly stressful, non-supportive working environments. This shortage will mean that patients in hospitals and long-term care may not get the frequent checks that they need to ensure quality of care, prevent complications and thereby increase hospital stays and increase mortality. This shortage will also mean that there will be not enough nurses to care for our vulnerable population such as children, the elderly or those with mental health problems. It will mean that there will not be enough nurses to promote health in our inner city environments and in the rural areas of our nation. There are several things that can be done right now to begin to increase the supply of nurses and to create the environments that will attract and retain nurses. ANA is encouraged by President Bush's budget blueprint that recommends focusing on resources, on grants that address current health care workforce challenges such as the nursing shortage. Now, the first thing that we can do is to support the expansion of programs under the Nurse Education Act reauthorized under Title VIII of the Health Professional Act of 1998. It provides for competitive grants to schools of nursing to strengthen nurse education. Unfortunately, lack of funding within the current NEA has kept the Health Services Administration from funding programs such as scholarships for disadvantaged students. The HRSA Division of Nursing reports that it will not even hold a competitive grant cycle for nurse stipend and pre-entry programs for this year due to lack of funds. The American Nurses Association supports a $25,000,000 increase to a total of $103,700,000 for NEA. Secondly, we need to find ways to increase the number of nursing faculty because the average age of the nursing faculty is 55 years. If we are going to be able to increase the number of nurses, we have to have the faculty to education them. Preparation at the Masters level could be increased through NEA by expanding the current loan repayment program. Fifty percent of all applications made for loan repayment, however, are denied due to a lack of funds. ANA supports increasing the funding for this repayment program to $10,000,000 for fiscal year 2002. Preparation of faculty at the doctoral level could also be increased to some degree through pre- and post-doctoral training grants provided by the National Institute for Nursing Research. Currently, we need to look at funding to ameliorate the shortage. We need to look at issues that address the nurses working environment. Research shows that health facilities catering to nursing needs are like magnets and can draw nurses to them. It is interesting, ANA has data that clearly indicates that when you have appropriate nurse staffing in acute care settings, there is a decrease in hospital-acquired infections, a decrease in patient falls, a decrease in pressure sores, a decrease in lengths of stay and an increase in patient satisfaction, all of which increase recovery and decrease the cost of health care. Appropriate staffing also increases nurse satisfaction with the care that they provide. Further, research has shown very clearly that the ability of nurses to have decision-making authority at the bedside and throughout the organization is one factor that enables hospitals to attract and retain nurses. Increased funding for the National Institute for Nursing Research so that research to find models to retain nurses and identify interventions that are able to achieve the desired health outcomes with the lowest cost is essential. Nursing research helps attract talented people into the profession and provides nurses with an opportunity to conduct research that makes a difference in the lives of patients. Mr. Chairman, we thank you for your support of nursing education and research. You have the opportunity to act in a way that will truly influence the health of our nation. Thank you. I would be happy to answer questions. [The information follows:] [GRAPHIC(S) NOT AVAILABLE IN TIFF FORMAT] Mr. Peterson. I would just like to run an issue by you. Last year when a group of nursing school people were visiting me, I urged them to come back and give us some ideas on how to deal with the nursing shortage. Two weeks ago they came to my office and gave me a proposal, asking for a little money. It was the following: This major nursing school from a major university in Pennsylvania is going to couple with a group of hospitals and also with a group of LPN programs and it will be a two-year nursing degree utilizing LPNs with a certain amount of floor experience. I would be interested in your reaction to that. That is sort of a difference in the trend. We have been phasing out of the two- and three-year programs that have provided a lot of our nurses to all four-year Bachelor degrees. Are we in a position where we may have to reverse that? Ms. Underwood. I do not personally agree with reversing that. The problem is, when you think about the shortage, many times people think, okay, let's get more bodies in there to give care. The reason this shortage that we are heading for, and it is going to peak around 2010, is that we have an increasing demand, because of the increasing acuity in the health care system throughout the country, we have a demand for an increase in nurses with more knowledge and experience. It is those very nurses that have more knowledge and experience would are going to be retiring and moving out of the system. So, just increasing the number of new people coming in is not going to help that. One of the things that I think is a much more attractive model that a number of State have been using, is to really encourage nurses who have their associate degree, their two-year programs, to make the articulation between the two-year and the four-year and the articulation actually between the LPN and the two-year and four-year much more smooth and to really get those people in and facilitate their moving up in terms of the nursing education. But just having more people educated is not enough if we don't change the working environments to keep people. You mentioned to another speaker about the people who are preparing for nursing and then going into other fields. While nursing is great, we need to keep them in nursing. Mr. Peterson. But I think something has happened that I didn't anticipate. I didn't realize a Bachelor degree nurse could go to school for one more year and go to almost any career that she wants. That is something I think we have to look at. I guess a lot of my hospital administrators and nursing home administrators would argue with your theory. I personally think we need to do what you want to do and do what this university wants to do. We can discuss that another day, but I think the problem is large enough that if we did all of the above, we are still going to be in trouble. Ms. Underwood. One important point that I think you did make and it came through: This is not a situation that nurses can solve by themselves, even if we are totally united as a profession. We really need to work with all of you and with the public and with the physicians and with the hospitals to address the issue. Mr. Peterson. Thank you. Mr. Regula [resuming chair]. Our next witness is Dr. William Harmon, Transplant Physician and Director of Pediatric Nephrology, Children's Hospital, Boston. We are happy to welcome you. ---------- Thursday, March 22, 2001. AMERICAN SOCIETY OF TRANSPLANTATION WITNESS WILLIAM E. HARMON, TRANSPLANT PHYSICIAN AND DIRECTOR OF PEDIATRIC NEPHROLOGY, CHILDRENS HOSPITAL, BOSTON, MASSACHUSETTS Dr. Harmon. Mr. Chairman, thank you for the opportunity to present testimony on behalf of the American Society of Transplantation. I am William Harmon, a transplant physician and Director of Pediatric Nephrology at Children's Hospital in Boston and Secretary-Treasurer and Chairman of the Public Policy Committee of the American Society of Transplantation. The AST, which is a professional organization that has no governmental support, was established in 1982. Our membership which now numbers more than 1,600 is comprised of physicians, surgeons and scientists engaged in the research and practice of transplantation medicine, surgery and immunobiology. The AST is the largest professional transplant organization in the United States and represents the majority of professionals in the field of transplantation. Today, there are more than 75,000 Americans whose names are on the organ transplant waiting list. During the next hour, four new names will be added to that list. By the time I get home to Boston this evening, at least 15 individuals will have died because the wait for a transplant was just too long. These patients awaiting transplantation represent a cross- section of our society. They are mothers and fathers who provide for their families. They are community and business leaders. And they are children who should havetheir entire lives ahead of them. We have made great strides in the past four decades of transplantation and we have developed extraordinary medical and surgical procedures to provide transplants to people with catastrophic organ failure. But the very success of these procedures has expanded the pool of candidates much faster than the supply of available donors. We simply don't have enough organs to transplant. The organ transplant waiting list has increased in size by approximately 380 percent in the last ten years while the number of available donors has changed very little. Each year the AST identifies the shortage of available donors as the number one problem in the field of transplantation. The Society is particularly pleased to see that Secretary Thompson was very quick to emphasize the need for enhancing organ donation in the United States. Support for organ donation is only half the battle. The other critical issue is ensuring the long-term survival and function of the transplanted organ. Over the last 40 years, transplantation of solid organs has moved from an experimental to an accepted therapy with approximately 22,000 transplants performed in the United States annually. The short-term success of this procedure has improved greatly over the last few years with recipients now enjoying more than 90 percent survival at one year. Most of this success can be attributed to research in immunosuppression that is being funded by Federal appropriations. Our better understanding of immunity and the body's response to foreign proteins has led to countless breakthroughs in many areas of medical science. The AST believes that now at the dawn of a new millennium we are on the threshold of many important scientific breakthroughs in the area of transplantation research. These include new insights into the immune mechanisms of rejection, the induction of total tolerance transplant organs, the immunologic response to animal organs and tissues, so-called Xenographs, and even bold new experiments in tissue engineering and organ development. As one example, two years ago NIAID, NIDDK and the Juvenile Diabetes Foundation collaborated in the formation of the Immune Tolerance Network, which is dedicated to the rapid development and deployment of novel clinical trials in the broad areas of organ transplantation and autoimmune diseases. Already new trials have begun and important scientific data are being collected by the ITN. AST strongly urges the subcommittee to continue its leadership in the area of biomedical research and to provide at least a 16 percent increase in funding for the NIH in fiscal year 2002. The AST supports the level of increase for NIAID and HLBI and NIDDK. To truly translate the promises of scientific discovery into better health for all Americans, the President, Congress, and the American people must continue the commitment to significant, sustained growth in funding for the NIH. Clinical and basic transplantation funding at the NIH must be increased. In particular, we recommend to Congress that the NIH give consideration to high priority initiatives of NIAID and HLBI and NIDDK, which I have provided to you in written testimony. The fruits of current research have produced many important successes in the field of transplantation. Ever more precise and powerful transplant immunosuppressive drugs have greatly increased both patient and graft survival. However, despite today's success, virtually all the transplanted organs will eventually be lost. Many challenges lie ahead of us, including the understanding of preexisting and concomitant illnesses such as cardiovascular disease, hypertension, infection, hepatitis, bone disease, diabetes and malignancies. In addition, the therapeutic strategies to induce donor- specific tolerance hold promise. The strategies to overcome Xenogenetic barriers have begun. Expansion of these programs, as well as others I have provided, will ultimately enable transplant physicians, surgeons and scientists to provide patients with a successful transplant for a failed organ for their entire natural lifetime. Therefore, I end my remarks here today by repeating AST's request that this subcommittee and Congress stay on track to double NIH's research budget by the year 2003 and permit these high priorities and initiatives to move forward. Thank you very much. Mr. Regula. Thank you. As I understand it, there is a nationwide compilation of the people who have need of a transplant so that you have to take your turn. Dr. Harmon. Yes. Every patient who is on the transplant list is known by what is known as the Organ Procurement and Transplant Network, which is funded through the NOTA legislation which was enacted in 1987. We track every patient and every donor so we know who is coming up. There are 75,000 of them waiting right now. Mr. Regula. I know. My secretary in the committee I previously chaired is waiting on lungs. I think she is number two or three at Johns Hopkins. I explored Pittsburgh and they said, well, the order of succession is the same no matter where you go because it is a nationwide program. Dr. Harmon. It is a national program. Mr. Regula. You are doing a lot of great work, though. I know my colleague, Floyd Spence, is a wonderful example of the success. He had a lung replacement maybe ten years ago. Well, thank you for coming. Dr. Harmon. Thank you very much. Mr. Regula. The next witness is Dorothy Mann, Board Member AIDS Alliance for Children, Youth and Families. ---------- Thursday, March 22, 2001. AIDS ALLIANCE FOR CHILDREN, YOUTH AND FAMILIES WITNESS DOROTHY MANN, BOARD MEMBER Ms. Mann. Good afternoon, Mr. Chairman. My name is Dorothy Mann. I am a Board member of the AIDS Alliance for Children, Youth and Families, a national organization addressing the needs of children, youth and families who are living with, affected by or at risk for HIV and AIDS. It is my honor also to serve on the CDC's HIV STD Prevention Advisory Committee. I am also the Executive Director of the Family Planning Council in Philadelphia, serving over 120,000 Title X funded family planning clients. We also provide a range of community- based HIV and STD prevention, screening and treatment services. Mr. Chairman, I am here today because our nation is becoming complacent about AIDS. How many new HIV infections do you think we have in this country every year? In 2001, 40,000 people will become newly infected with HIV. Half of these infections will occur in people under 25. That means 100 people in this country will become infected with HIV today and again tomorrow. Can we prevent HIV from infecting 40,000 people in America? Yes. But it will take bolder leadership, increased funding and smarter allocation of resources. The Ryan White Care Act, which was reauthorized by Congress in the year 2000, is the most critical Federal program dedicated to people living with HIV and AIDS. Today I will focus on Title IV of the Care Act, which provides funding for medical care, social services and access to research for children, youth, women and families. Simply put, Title IV is a success story. It has enabled communities to respond quickly and efficiently to the HIV epidemic. Since the science became clear about the role of AZT in reducing mother-to-child HIV transmission, Title IV grantees, including my own, have played a major role in the remarkable steady decline in the number of infants born with HIV in this country. CDC estimates that fewer than 200 infants were born with HIV last year. But even one baby born with this disease is too many. As the number of HIV-infected women of childbearing age rises, reducing perionatal transmission becomes more challenging and expensive. Despite the successes of Title IV, currently funded at $65,000,000, much more needs to be done. The President's budget calls for a four percent increase in discretionary spending. But with 40,000 new infections each year, we need to increase spending on Federal AIDS programs much more than four percent or people will die. If funding for the Federal AIDS program does not keep pace, individuals, families and entire communities across the country will continue to be decimated by this terrible disease. The AIDS Alliance recommends a total funding of $83,000,000 for Title IV for fiscal year 2002. This is a 28 percent increase over 2001, which is the same rate we received this year. As you know, the Congressional Black Caucus Minority AIDS initiative has provided critical increase in Federal AIDS programs reflecting the disproportionate impact of HIV and AIDS on communities of color. Eighty-four percent of the clients served by Title IV are people of color. AIDS Alliance would be happy to provide additional information to this committee as you consider the Congressional Black Caucus funding for 2002. It goes without saying that HIV is spread from an infected person to an uninfected person. Thus far we have focused HIV prevention efforts almost exclusively on uninfected people. We have largely ignored those who are already infected. Mounting evidence suggests that as people with HIV are living longer and more active lives, they are more likely to engage in unprotected sex. Let me be clear. I am not advocating laws or policies that criminalize or stigmatize HIV-positive people or their behavior. I am talking about interventions that help HIV-positive people reduce their risk behavior and protect their uninfected partners. What can be done? We must work to break down the walls between HIV prevention and care programs. As you appropriate funding to agencies such as HRSA, CDC, and SMSA, you must encourage coordination to the greatest extent possible to reduce barriers between these agencies and between prevention and care. It is estimated that CDC needs an additional $300 million each year to implement their new strategic plan to reduce HIV new infections to 20,000. Scientific evidence should be the basis for HIV infection policies. We know, for example, that needle exchange programs work and do not increase drug use. Yet, we still have Federal restrictions on their funding. We need to take politics out of science. Let me leave you with a final thought: Reversing the nation's growing complacency about AIDS is a daunting task, but we must do more, much more, than simply prevent an escalation in the rate of new infections. It is intolerable. If we had 40,000 American casualties in a war, would we find that acceptable? I hardly think so. We have to do more because if we don't, it will only get worse. Thank you. [GRAPHIC(S) NOT AVAILABLE IN TIFF FORMAT] Mr. Regula. Our next witness is Emily Sheketoff, Executive Director, American Library Association. ---------- Thursday, March 22, 2001. AMERICAN LIBRARY ASSOCIATION WITNESS EMILY SHEKETOFF, EXECUTIVE DIRECTOR Ms. Sheketoff. Thank you, Chairman Regula. We wish to thank you for your support for our libraries in the past. We look forward to working with you on behalf of America's libraries in your first year as Chairman of this subcommittee. I know that you are familiar with libraries, as a result of your experiences as a teacher, and as the father of a librarian at Western Reserve in Hudson, Ohio. I would like to talk to you about the crucial benefits that Federal support brings to the libraries. Mr. Regula. You did not know that my wife started the National First Ladies Library. Ms. Sheketoff. Yes, sir, and I have a terrific magazine article with a good picture of that for you. [Laughter.] So I tried hard. On Federal support for libraries, we would like to talk about two key National goals: outreach to those for whom libraries service requires extra effort or special materials, such as individuals with disabilities; and mechanisms to identify, preserve, and share library and information resources across institutional or governmental boundaries through technology. The library community is capable of astonishing creativity and expertise in support of National goals such as revitalizing the economy, having children start school ready to learn, and developing literate, informed adults. Oftentimes, one of the few sources of funding for innovation available to libraries is Federal funding. It is estimated that library programs generate from three to four dollars for every Federal dollar invested. Mr. Chairman, our new President has said on many occasions, ``We must leave no child behind.'' I can tell you that America's libraries believe that we must lead no reader behind. That is why we feel so strongly that library programs need additional Federal funding. We need to ensure equitable access and participation of our Nation's readers to library activities and opportunities in their communities. We need to support our libraries continuing efforts to keep pace with the rapidly changing information technology environment. We need to recognize the important contributions that libraries make to the social, civic, and educational health of their communities. Like many schools, libraries often service as the hubs of their communities, and provide important services, training in technology, and opportunities for life long learning, particularly in traditionally under-served areas. Recently, the library community corroborated on developing a draft for the reauthorization of the Library Services and Technology Act, which will expire in fiscal year 2002. We are seeking to increase the authorization level to $500 million. As you know, this represents a significant expansion in the Federal Government's commitment to the support of our Nation's libraries. Today, we request your support for fiscal year 2002 of a down-payment of $350 million for library programs authorized under LSTA. With this increase, more libraries could expand their services to include technology training and literacy programs that enable students to achieve the success and education, and programs for families, who may not have not used libraries before. Library programs for young children encourage pre-reading skills and develop a love for reading. Mr. Regula. We will have to wrap it up. I am going to have to go vote here. You are preaching to the choir. Ms. Sheketoff. Great, well, I just wanted to give you an example in Ohio. In this year, Ohio received $5.5 million. If the state distribution was increased to $350 million, Ohio would get about $11 million. This would enable Ohio to complete the school library connections to the statewide Ohio network. In 1999, the libraries of Ohio requested $7.5 million in LSTA funding, but received only $2.9 million. So you see, the need is great and the funds available can stretch only so far. We are also asking that this subcommittee support education Title 6, the Block Grant that goes to libraries, at least at the $400 million level. As you know, school library materials are only one option of this block grant. Unfortunately, less and less of the funds are used for school library materials. As a result, many school libraries have old, outdated, and inaccurate material on their shelves. Research shows that a good library media program in the school is an excellent predictor of student achievement. In summary, an increase in LSTA funding to $350 million would allow more of the 16,000 libraries to begin to provide Internet training and information access services to families, adult learners, the small business sector, and the communities who need them. Thank you very much, Mr. Chairman. [The information follows:] [GRAPHIC(S) NOT AVAILABLE IN TIFF FORMAT] Mr. Regula. Thank you, and they are very important. I understand that. We, of course, have constraints on what we have available. Ms. Sheketoff. With a real dedication to education, the library component is really critical. Mr. Regula. Well, we hope that we get enough adequate funding from OMB. Thank you for coming today. I regret that I have to get over to there and vote or we will run out of time. Ms. Sheketoff. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. Mr. Regula. The committee will be in recess for about 10 minutes. [Recess.] Mr. Regula. We will reconvene. Our next witness is Mr. Richard Kase. ---------- Thursday, March 22, 2001. ARTHRITIS FOUNDATION NORTHEAST OHIO CHAPTER WITNESS RICHARD D. KASE, CHAIRMAN, CANTON OHIO ADVISORY BOARD, ARTHRITIS FOUNDATION NORTHEAST OHIO CHAPTER Mr. Kase. Good afternoon, Mr. Chairman and members of the subcommittee, which are few and far between at this stage of the game. Mr. Regula. Yes, that is true. Mr. Kase. It is truly an honor to speak to you, one of Canton's favorite sons. I want to thank you for the opportunity to speak today about how Congress can continue to play an important role in helping improve the quality of life for the 43 million Americans living with arthritis, including the 300,000 children living with the disease. Specifically, I would like to thank the subcommittee for its leadership in supporting funding increases to support arthritis research at the National Institute of Arthritis, and musculoskeletal skeletal and skin diseases and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention's Arthritis Program. As I said, my name is Richard Kase. I am from Canton, Ohio. I am a business man and a volunteer. I am here today in my role with Arthritis Foundation of Northeast Ohio as the Volunteer Chair of the Canton Area Advisory Board. I am also one of the 43 million Americans living with this painful and oftentimes debilitating disease. I was first diagnosed with osteoarthritis in 1992, at the age of 40. Due to osteoarthritis, I have had five knee operations and one back surgery. While osteoarthritis limits my daily activities, simply climbing stairs is extremely painful. I consider myself fortunate. For today, there is new hope for the millions of Americans with arthritis. We have new, more effective therapies to prevent pain and disability, thanks to the Federal investment in research. With the CDC's arthritis program, we are reaching out and empowering millions of Americans to help them take steps to improve their quality of life. Mr. Chairman, 95,000 persons living in Ohio's 16th Congressional District have arthritis. One of those individuals is Tiffany Kenyan. Tiffany was diagnosed with juvenile rheumatoid arthritis at the age of four. Every day is a challenge, as she faces the pain, physical disabilities, and psychological trauma brought on by the disease. Now a teenager, Tiffany has been unable to do many of the activities that most of her friends take for granted. However, thanks to new therapies, early diagnosis in the treatment and the support of family, she plans golf, dances, and swims when possible. She may have arthritis, but it does not have her. Like me, Tiffany has been a beneficiary of the research investments in the National Institutes of Health by this subcommittee. Our lives have been made better, thanks to a new generation of treatments and therapies, for the many serious forms of the disease. Ongoing growth in the NIH budget will provide the National Institute for Arthritis and Musculoskeletal and Skin Diseases the resources to support critical research ranging from osteoarthritis to lupus to juvenile rheumatoid arthritis. To meet this pressing national need, the Foundation urges the members of the subcommittee to continue the doubling of the NIH budget, within five years, and provide $462 million, as part of the NIH's fiscal year 2002 appropriations for NIAMs. With this in mind, the Arthritis Foundation strongly believes this investment must be matched with a similar investment in public health programs, designed to ensure that all Americans benefit from our new understandings about the disease, effective self-management strategies, and improved treatment options. As a person with arthritis, I am proud that Congress has recognized the importance of this national effort by establishing and funding the National Arthritis Action Plan, which is a public health strategy. This innovative public health strategy is being implemented by the CDC, in partnership with state health departments across America. The Arthritis Foundation, and its 55 state-based chapters. Among our goals are improving the scientific information base on arthritis; researching how we can better prevent arthritis; and encouraging more individuals with arthritis to seek early diagnosis and treatment, to reduce pain and disability. Due to this subcommittee's support and leadership, the CDC was provided with $12 million as part of the fiscal year 2001 budget, to move forward with this vision. To date, 37 states have been awarded funds to begin executing the plan. Based on the enthusiasm of our state partners, the Foundation's commitment to invest its resources, and the pressing need to address the growing public health problems associated with arthritis, we strongly encourage the members of the subcommittee to provide the CDC with $24.5 million, as part of the fiscal year 2002 budget, to help establish state-based arthritis programs in all states in territories. This modest investment will help us meet the challenge of arthritis, and lead to a day when arthritis is no longer the leading cause of disability in the U.S., for individuals 18 years of age and older. It will help lead to a day when arthritis no longer costs our economy $82.5 billion a year in medical care and related expenses, including lost productivity. Congressman Regula, for generations, we have labored under the many myths surrounding arthritis. Arthritis was an inevitable part of the aging process. There were no effective treatment options, apart from taking a few aspirin. Exercise was harmful for individuals with arthritis. Children do not get arthritis was another myth. It cannot be prevented. Today, we stand ready with the necessary tools, expertise and energy, to shatter these myths, and capitalize on the fruits of our research to help improve the lives of Americans living with arthritis. On behalf of the 43 million Americans living with arthritis, I appreciate the opportunity to speak to you today, and urge the members of the subcommittee to help us win the war against arthritis by supporting funding for these critical Federal Programs. It has been a pleasure and honor to testify to you today on behalf of all of the arthritis victims. Thank you. [The information follows:] [GRAPHIC(S) NOT AVAILABLE IN TIFF FORMAT] Mr. Regula. You are saying that there have been some very substantial progress, though? Mr. Kase. There has been tremendous progress, relative to new drugs that have reached the market; great progress relative to public awareness and prevention. Mr. Regula. Do the drugs just relieve the pain, or do they actually affect some degree of cure or change? Mr. Kase. It is really a supplement to other non-steroidal drugs, just to relieve the pain. I, for one, have been on Vioxx, which is a new medication. You take one a day, as opposed to the 12 Advil that I was taking every day. Mr. Regula. I see Vioxx advertised. Does it work pretty effectively? Mr. Kase. For me, it has worked very well. For some people, it does not work quite as well, and it has some side effects for other individuals. But for me, it was a very good drug, and is a very good drug. Mr. Regula. Thank you for coming. I know it is a substantial trip here from Canton, Ohio. Mr. Kase. But to come to see you, Congressman, it was well worth it. [Laughter.] Mr. Regula. You had better reserve judgment until we get the bill out and see. Mr. Kase. Well, we will talk about that back in Canton.Thank you. [Laughter.] Mr. Regula. Well, we are going to do what we can for all of these things. It depends what we have available in the allocation of funds, which is beyond our control. Our next witness is Dr. Paul Mintz, Professor of Pathology and Internal Medicine, University of Virginia Health System. ---------- Thursday, March 22, 2001. AMERICAN ASSOCIATION OF BLOOD BANKS WITNESS PAUL MINTZ, M.D., PROFESSOR OF PATHOLOGY AND INTERNAL MEDICINE, UNIVERSITY OF VIRGINIA HEALTH SYSTEM; AMERICAN ASSOCIATION OF BLOOD BANKS Dr. Mintz. Good afternoon, Mr. Chairman. I appreciate the opportunity very much to come here today. I am Professor of Pathology and Internal Medicine at the University of Virginia. Today, I am speaking to you on behalf of the American Association of Blood Banks, the professional society for approximately 8,000 individuals involved in blood banking and transfusion medicine; and about 2,000 institutional members, including community blood centers, the American Red Cross, and hospital-based services. Mr. Regula. I understand they are having trouble getting people to donate. Is that true? Dr. Mintz. That is true, sir. There really has been intermittent blood shortages. Of course, fewer and fewer people are eligible to donate, as restrictions are put into place. Mr. Regula. Yes, well, mad cow disease has put a six month waiting period on anyone in England, as I understand it. Dr. Mintz. It is anyone who actually has lived in England, between 1980 and 1996, for six months, cannot be a blood donor, indefinitely, in the United States. Mr. Regula. Indefinitely? Dr. Mintz. That is correct. That actually is also going to apply now in France, for people who have been in France for 10 years or Portugal for 10 years, based on a new recommendation. So there are fewer and fewer eligible blood donors in this country; that is correct. AABB has long recognized the critical role of the National Institutes of Health, and especially the National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute, and other public health agencies that they have played in ensuring that patients have access to the best possible transfusion therapies. In fact, today, the Nation's blood supply is safer than it has ever been. Each year, over 26 million units of blood are transfused into millions of individuals. With enhanced Federal support for research, transfusion medicine promises new lifesaving therapies, as well as an even safer blood supply. We strongly encourage to support the following research initiatives. First, ongoing Federal support for blood supply data is needed. Blood safety and availability are inseparable requirements for ensuring optimal patient care. The safest possible blood component cannot benefit the patient if it is not readily available. The number and duration of seasonal blood shortages are increasing. An aging population and more complex medical procedures have resulted in an increasing demand for blood. In order to predict and prepare for possible shortages, we need reliable data regarding both collection and utilization of all types of blood components. In 1996, recognizing the significant need for blood supply data, the AABB founded the National Blood Data Resource Center, the NBDRC. In prior years, NHLBI had funded this data collection. However, when this Federal funding ceased, there was a clear vacuum in public and private support for national blood data collection. The AABB is very proud of the fine work that the NBDRC has produced, including its important biennial nationwide blood collection and utilization survey. In fiscal year 2000, the NHLBI agreed to fund the collection of certain monthly supply statistics. Unfortunately, ongoing support from the NHLBI for blood supply data is not continuing in fiscal year 2001. The AABB is very concerned that so long as no specific Federal agency is responsible for supporting critical data collection regarding the blood supply, we will not be able to generate necessary long-term information. Policymakers, including Congress, cannot make sound decisions affecting patients lives, absent reliable data. Therefore, the AABB strongly urges Congress to designate an appropriate office within the Public Health Service, to be responsible for Federal support of blood supply data collection. In addition, Congress should appropriate sufficient dollars to support long-term efforts, like those of the National Blood Data Resource Center, to collect,analyze, and distribute data about the Nation's blood supply. In short, we need to know who is donating the blood, what kind of components are being collected, and where it is going. Then we can plan responsibly regarding donor selection criteria, and patient initiatives. Mr. Regula. I assume you work with the American Red Cross, since they seem to take the lead. Dr. Mintz. Yes, that is correct. The American Red Cross is responsible for about half the blood collection in this country, and then other community blood centers are responsible for the other half. We, in the AABB, actually work with all of these centers. A second initiative that I would like to suggest is research regarding non-infectious risks of transfusion. The AABB urges the subcommittee to support additional Federal efforts to enhance the safety of blood transfusion. In recent decades, the United States invested significantly in reducing transfusion risks associated with infectious diseases, as you well know. This investment has paid off dramatically. When I first taught medical students in 1979, I told them there was one percent risk of acquiring what is not hepatitis C from a blood transfusion. That risk is now about one in a million. The same kind of statistics apply to HIV. The risk of acquiring such an infection from a blood transfusion has actually been reduced about 10,000 fold in the last 20 years. Mr. Regula. So you have better control. Dr. Mintz. We have better testing, better donor screening, and also viral inactivation of many blood components. Mr. Regula. How do we help? Dr. Mintz. Actually, I think that right now, Federal funding should be directed toward non-infectious risks. There is actually about a 100 fold increase in risk of patient who is receiving a blood transfusion right now, getting the wrong unit, than there is of getting an infection. There has not been an investment in the processes to assure appropriate safeguards in getting the right unit to the right patient. Mr. Regula. Where would that investment be; CDC, NIH? Dr. Mintz. I think it would be in developing a clinical trials network, that would emphasize research in the non- infectious risks of transfusion, including providing processes to get the right unit to the right patient, and other non- infectious risks, such as immuno-modulation. Mr. Regula. Well, thank you, and we will put your testimony in the record. Dr. Mintz. Thank you very much. [The information follows:] [GRAPHIC(S) NOT AVAILABLE IN TIFF FORMAT] Mr. Regula. We have two young ladies here, and one of them from my district. They are in the Presidential classroom, and this is the real world, young ladies. What we are doing in here will touch your lives, because we do all the research on medical, and something that is discovered over the next many months and years may save your life. Likewise, we do education. Of course, I am sure that is important to both of you. So we are happy to welcome you. As soon as we get finished up here, we will go back and get a picture with you in the office. Okay, next we have Kathryn Peppe, President of the Association of Maternal and Child Health Programs. ---------- Thursday, March 22, 2001. ASSOCIATION OF MATERNAL AND CHILD HEALTH PROGRAMS WITNESS KATHRYN PEPPE, PRESIDENT, ASSOCIATION OF MATERNAL AND CHILD HEALTH PROGRAMS Ms. Peppe. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. I am Kathy Peppe, President of Association of Maternal and Child and Health Programs. I am also the Chief of the Division of Family and Community Health Services at the Ohio Department of Health. That is Ohio's maternal and health program. Thank you for the opportunity to testify today. We at the Association of Maternal Child and Health Programs really appreciate the subcommittee's interest and support of Maternal and Child Health Services Block Grant, and all of the programs that are supported with that funding source in our states. For over 65 years, programs authorized under Title 5 of the Social Security Act, the Maternal and Child Health Programs Block Grant, have helped fulfill our Nation's strong commitment to improving the health of all mothers and children. Title 5 is the foundation of our Nation's public health system. It continues today to watch over and promote the health of mothers, children, and youth, while serving as a safety net program for all of our country's high risk and most vulnerable residents. State maternal and child health programs funded by the Block Grant have demonstrated their ability to adapt through decades of change. We have had to respond to the emergence of new diseases, the discovery of new vaccines and treatment methods, and the changing health care financing and delivery systems across the country. Yet Congress has remained committed to this public health program, because we have been accountable for what we have been doing. We have provided proven preventive health programs with demonstrated and measurable results. Grants to the State Health Departments are used to help locally-determined needs that are consistent with the national healthy people goals for fiscal year 2010 or 2000, so on. This includes reducing maternal and infant mortality, helping children with disabilities function to their full potential, and educating children and adolescents about how to reduce risky behaviors and learn healthy lifestyles. The Maternal and Child Health Block Grant encompasses lots more than just moms and babies. Children with special health care needs and teenagers are a major focus for our programs. Maternal and Child Health Programs ultimately address the health needs of families. The flexibility of the Block Grant gives us the chance to develop innovative programs and services that go beyond health care needs to address individual specific needs and help people access needed health care services. Last year, Congress raised the authorization level for the Title 5 Program to $850 million. While funding for other public health programs has been expanded over the past five years, Title 5's funding has remained relatively flat in the past decade. So the increased authorization was desperately needed and comes at an ideal time for us in states. The MCH programs have just completed a five year needs assessment. As a result, all of the states and territories are poised to move forward to address their unmet health needs, as soon as additional funding is appropriated. Each state knows precisely how it would allocate its resources to meet the priority needs for maternal and child health populations. In Ohio, we could use additional funds to expand our child and family health services clinic programs. These are clinics that provide primary health care for pregnant women, child and infants, who otherwise would go without health care. We could implement a statewide system of child fatality review. We could offer additional children with special health care needs access to the services of specialists around the state. We could put preventive dental sealants on the teeth of more children to reduce cavities. I want to share with you a couple of stories about real people, who we have touched in Ohio. Anna is someone who is from Stark County, your home. She is a pregnant 31 year old woman with a history of premature delivery, closely spaced pregnancies, and late entry into prenatal care; plus asthma, tobacco use, drug use, homelessness, and three of her four children are in permanent placement. Fortunately, Ohio's Title 5 Program had what Anna needed. The Ohio Infant Mortality Reduction Initiative paired a trained outreach worker from the local neighborhood, where these high risk, low income pregnant women, who are either uninsured or under-insured. The outreach worker helped this mom, and subsequently her baby, get into care and stay in care, as well as meet other basic needs. Thanks to the outreach program, Anna has her own apartment today. She has completed parenting classes and attends substance abuse treatment programs. The best news is that she delivered a healthy beautiful and drug free baby girl, she regained custody of one of her other children. This is a victory for Ohio. In its recent needs assessment, Ohio Title 5 Program identified the reduction of infant mortality, particularly for those with disabilities, as one of our top 10 health issues. It is an excellent example of how assessment of local needs can translate into effective programs. Let me just close by saying that we are urging you to remember the faces of people who are actually touched by block grants in the states and their stories like Anna's. There are hundreds of thousands of other stories that we could share with you similar to these. Please fully fund the Title 5 Program at $850 million. Mr. Regula. It sounds like you are having a lot of success and that is what we like to hear on these programs. Ms. Peppe. Yes, thank you. I would be happy to answer any questions. Mr. Regula. Thank you. [The information follows:] [GRAPHIC(S) NOT AVAILABLE IN TIFF FORMAT] Mr. Regula. Our next witness is Carl Suter, Director of Vocational Rehabilitation Programs, Council of State Administrators; welcome. ---------- Thursday, March 22, 2001. COUNCIL OF STATE ADMINISTRATORS OF VOCATIONAL REHABILITATION WITNESS CARL SUTER, DIRECTOR, COUNCIL OF STATE ADMINISTRATORS OF VOCATIONAL REHABILITATION Mr. Suter. Good afternoon, Mr. Chairman, I am Carl Suter. I am the Director of the Illinois Rehabilitation Agency of Vocation Rehabilitation Services. I also am a member of the Council of State Administrators of Vocational Rehabilitation. We are a Federal and State partnership, and have been a partnership for over 80 years in helping individuals with disabilities become employed. The Rehabilitation Act and the Vocational Rehabilitation Program is the cornerstone of our Nation's commitment to serving individuals with disabilities and helping them to become employed. Our program, every year, get thousands of folks into jobs. One of the things that I am here to tell you today, is that even though I know Congress had intended in the past to give our program cost of living increases every year, states like Ohio and Illinois are not receiving those cost of living increases. For example, in Illinois, we received less than one-half of one percent of an increase for cost of living. Mr. Regula. Do you think that other states are getting it, and you are not; or is it across the board? Mr. Suter. Well, because of the way the formula works, in Illinois and Ohio, the formula has had an adverse impact on us being able to get what the COLA, the overall COLA that you had for the program. In Illinois, we got less than one-half of one percent. I think that Ohio got less than two percent of an increase. This comes at a time in which, when you would look at Louis Harris pole and other National surveys, we know that 70 percent of people of disabilities are not employed. Yet, two thirds of those wish to work. Individuals between the ages of 18 and 60 are not working, and yet they want to work. Our program has many pressures on it. The special education program, is a great program, a sister program, that helps many youths with disabilities get great services. Now as those youth begin to come to adulthood, and they come to vocational rehabilitation, that adds additional pressures to our program to serve them. I would like to tell you about one youth in Illinois to kind of illustrate this point. Rick is a young man with Down's Syndrome in the Chicago area. We started working with him when he was a junior in high school. We helped him get a job after school and on weekends. When Rick graduated last summer, he told us that he did not want to sit at home, like some of his friends were going to be doing. He wanted to work. He wanted a real job. He did not want to have to get $550 each month from SSI. He wanted to work. We got Rick a job working in a hospital. He is earning over $9 an hour. He is getting full benefits. There are thousands of Ricks in this country. They want to work, and they turn to vocational rehabilitation services for the kinds of training technology that they need. There are many pressures on our program. The Olmstead decision is another one, where folks are coming out of institutions and now into the community. Not only do they want to live independently; they want to work. With TANF, we have had great success in this country in getting folks off of TANF. But what is left now is the hard core of that population. Many of those, in fact, have disabilities and they are coming to us for vocational rehabilitation services. We have enough funds to only serve one in twenty eligible individuals with disabilities; one in twenty. Yet, the data shows that there are thousands and thousands, hundreds of thousands of folks who need our services. The Rehabilitation Services Administration tells us that in fiscal year 1999, we spent $2.2 billion on services for this population. We serve nationally over 1.2 million people and got 230,000 of those folks into competitive jobs. Sir, let me leave you with one recommendation. Our Council of State Administrators of Vocational Rehabilitation would like for us to be able to have an increase that will allow us to serve these hundreds of thousands of folks who come to us. We are asking for a 10 percent increase in funding, about 6.5 percent over the regular CPI that we would normally bereceiving. That equates to about $240 million. Mr. Regula. Well, you really have two problems. You need to change the formula, because I think it penalizes Illinois and Ohio; and secondly, of course, to get more money into the program. Mr. Suter. Right. Mr. Regula. Thank you for coming. Mr. Suter. Thank you very much. Mr. Regula. I know that it is a good program. I am familiar with it back home. Mr. Suter. Thank you. [The information follows:] [GRAPHIC(S) NOT AVAILABLE IN TIFF FORMAT] Mr. Regula. Our next witness is Steve Korn, President of National Council of Social Security Management Associations. ---------- Thursday, March 22, 2001. NATIONAL COUNCIL OF SOCIAL SECURITY MANAGEMENT ASSOCIATIONS, INC. WITNESS STEVE KORN, PRESIDENT, NATIONAL COUNCIL OF SOCIAL SECURITY MANAGEMENT ASSOCIATIONS, INC. Mr. Korn. Chairman Regula, my name is Steve Korn and I am here as President of the National Council of Social Security Management Associations, an organization of over 3,000 managers and supervisors who work in SSA's field offices and telephone centers. Thank you for giving me the opportunity to come before you today to talk about the budget needs of the Social Security Administration, from the perspective of the front-line managers and supervisors who are directly responsible for delivering service to the American public. Over the past two decades, SSA has witnessed a dramatic reduction in staff. For example, the local Canton, Ohio field office lost seven positions just in the past six years. In addition, over the past five years, supervisory staff in SSA's local field offices and telephone centers have been reduced by more than 1,000 positions. Accommodations of dramatic reductions in both overall and supervisory staff, has resulted in a critical situation whereby the level and quality of service provided to the public is in severe jeopardy. A little over a year ago, the Bipartisan Social Security Advisory Board warned of the need to bolster resources in the Social Security field offices. The board found that staff resources in offices all over the country have declined to the point where their ability to provide quality service to the community is threatened. The board reaffirmed these findings in an updated report issued earlier this month. To better quantify the findings of the Social Security Advisory Board, our organization conducted a survey of field office management throughout the country. The responses which were received from managers in over 50 percent of all field offices confirm that services were below acceptable levels in three critical areas: telephone service, the quality of work products, and in employee training. They also found that customer waiting times are increasing. A copy of these findings has been sent to this committee, as well as to each Congressional office. While the statistics of the results are revealing, I thought it was interesting to share a couple of the more than 64 pages of comments that we received from these front-line managers. For example, regarding telephone service, a manager in the Chicago region, which includes the State of Ohio writes the following: ``We need more incoming lines. However, we do not have the staff to cover the additional lines.'' Another manager offered this chilling story. A physician contacted us in response to a representative pay issue. He wrote the manager saying he was on hold for over an hour. Fortunately, he had a speaker phone, which enabled him to take care of his patients while waiting for us to answer. Hedisconnected the call before we ever spoke to him. In his letter he stated, ``You call me from now on, because I will never contact Social Security again.'' I wish I could tell you that this was simply an isolated incident, but unfortunately, it really is not. Another Chicago region manager wrote, ``As we take the SSA measures to the community, we have generated more work for the staff. We say we are ambassadors of the agency, and cultivate good relationships with neighborhood. We then make our public wait longer to be served, and have insufficient staff to validate what we went out preached.'' Another manager writes, ``Quality has suffered here to a great extent as the result of the loss of front-line supervisors. These were the people with the hands-on experience. They reviewed the work. They addressed individual employee shortcomings. They saw to the technical needs of the employees. Now they are gone.'' If these current service delivery and quality problems were not bad enough, Social Security will face additional challenges over the coming decade, as the large baby boom generation begins to file for disability and retirement benefits, at the same time that the agency faces its own wave of retirements. For example, Quinzella Hobbs, who is the manager of the Canton Field Office, reports that right now, 29 percent of her staff has both the age and required years of services to retire today. It generally takes replacement hires three years to become fully productive. In the face of these current and future challenges, NCSSA recommends the following. First, SSA's budget should reflect the immediate need to increase front-line staffing in SSA's field offices by 5,000 full-time equivalents, a 17.5 percent increase. Second, SSA's field offices and telephone centers should be allowed to fill front-line supervisory positions, based on the need to maintain adequate levels of quality training and customer service. Third, SSA's administrative budget should be removed from the discretionary spending caps, along with SSA's program budget, allowing Congress to allocate sufficient funds to SSA, based on demonstrated service needs. As an independent agency, in accordance with Section 104(b) of the Social Security Act, Social Security submitted its own fiscal year 2000 budget to this committee. Social Security requested $8.11 billion, which is $438 million more than was requested by the new Administration. The additional funds will allow SSA to begin to address many of the problems identified. For example, new employees can be hired now, so they can be trained and up to speed before we lose our experienced employees. Certainly, we would urge you to support this higher level of funding. Mr. Chairman, I thank you again for inviting my testimony. I am certainly happy to answer any questions that you might have. [The information follows:] [GRAPHIC(S) NOT AVAILABLE IN TIFF FORMAT] Mr. Regula. Well, thank you, and I am aware of some of the problems because, of course, we look to our local Social Security Office to help with constituent problems. I have hired a couple of your people away. That is probably one of the reasons that you have a shortage. [Laughter.] They are good people, and they are well trained. It works out well for us. But we are aware of the problem, and we, of course, have the report that was submitted. Thank you for coming. Where are you located? Mr. Korn. I am located in Vallejo, California, Northern California. Again, the problems we face are very similar to what is faced in your state. Mr. Regula. Is automation helping you? Mr. Korn. Automation is essential. Quite honestly, without automation, we would be much worse. The problem is, there is not enough automation out there to address the problems. Mr. Regula. Somebody has to put the material in to automate. Mr. Korn. And there has to be people to use what is out there. So it is a combination. It is not one answer. Mr. Regula. Well, thanks for coming; you have made a long trip here. Mr. Korn. Yes, I have. Mr. Regula. We appreciate it. Mr. Korn. I am happy to do it. Mr. Regula. Do not be too distressed that we do not have other committee members here. You have got the most important people here, and that is the staff. Mr. Korn. That is absolute true, and we have the Chairman. Thank you very much. Mr. Regula. You are welcome. Our next witness is Mr. John Black, General Counsel, National High School Federation. ---------- Thursday, March 22, 2001. NATIONAL HIGH SCHOOL FEDERATION WITNESS JOHN BLACK, GENERAL COUNSEL, NATIONAL HIGH SCHOOL FEDERATION Mr. Black. Thank you. Good afternoon, and I appreciate the opportunity to give the keynote address here today. Actually, Dr. Martin and I are both from Indiana. Given the success, or lack thereof, of the Indiana University basketball team, I guess we are just having one of those weeks. Mr. Regula. Well, your former coach was from my district. Mr. Black. Oh, really? Mr. Regula. Yes, we keep chairs away up there. [Laughter.] Please continue. Mr. Black. Well, I am here on behalf of the National High School Federation, which is an organization comprised of all 50 state associations and the District of Columbia, and one of the members is Clara Mascara in Ohio High School Athletic Association. We have approximately seven million young people who play under the rules that we write each year in 17 sports. One of them is right here, and maybe both of them. We have got a couple of high school athletes there. We have a concern that is coming up. It factors into the idea that a lot of teachers who used to be coaches are going on to other things; either they are getting tired of coaching or they run for Congress. So we wind up with a situation where instead of having experienced educators providing coaching to young people, we wind up, particularly at the lower level, the JV and freshmen and sophomore teams and in middle schools, with a lot parents and a lot of volunteers from the community, who may know something about ``Xs and Os,'' but are not necessarily experienced in the teaching skills that help them instill what we like to think of are some of the advantages of participation in inter-scholastic activities. The CDC has pointed lately very much at childhood obesity, and Health and Human Services has talked a lot about the benefits of extra-curricular participation, in terms of staying in school, better grades, lower team pregnancies, lower incidents of drug use. So we think we are doing a good thing. It costs about three percent of the total budget for education to take care of athletics and extra-curricular activities. However, we are winding up with all these coaches who really need to have a little bit of extra help, in terms of how to take advantage of what we call the teachable moments that come in the course of teaching. We have a program that has worked for about 10 years. It is the Coaches Education Program. It is very inexpensive. It costs about $40 per person. It is focused on people who are not trained educators. Our concern is that although we are giving it to about 25,000 people a year, that is only a drop in the bucket. We have got an awful lot more coaches out there, and there is a very high turnover. So we are thinking that it might make some sense to try a model program, where we make it available, and particularly available to inner city in situations, where the $40 to come as a volunteer coach may seem as a real impediment. We would like to try that on an experimental basis in a couple of states, to just see if it works and see if it helps. Mr. Regula. Have you put your suggestion in your statement? Mr. Black. We have. Mr. Regula. We will get a chance to look at it. Mr. Black. Okay. Mr. Regula. And we appreciate your being here. Mr. Black. Thank you very much. [The information follows:] [GRAPHIC(S) NOT AVAILABLE IN TIFF FORMAT] Mr. Regula. All right, our last witness today is Dr. William Martin, President and CEO of Indiana University Health Care, and President of the American Thoracic Society, and Board Member of the American Lung Association. Tell us your story. ---------- Thursday, March 22, 2001. THE AMERICAN LUNG ASSOCIATION AND THE AMERICAN THORACIC SOCIETY WITNESS WILLIAM J. MARTIN, II, MD, THE AMERICAN LUNG ASSOCIATION AND THE AMERICAN THORACIC SOCIETY Dr. Martin. Well, I realize that I am the last witness of the last day. I would first like to thank you and your members. This is our only chance to put forth the story for our patients and the scientific community, and we thank you very much for this opportunity. I am a pulmonary and critical care physician at Indian University and, as you noted, President of the American Thoracic Society and a Board Member of the American Lung Association. In my brief time before you today, I would like to raise three issues. The first is the rapidly disappearing physician scientist. That is not simply physician scientists in lung disease, but in all of health related science. Physician scientists are essential to the research enterprise, because they link bench research to the patient's bedside. However, fewer and fewer physicians are devoting their time and talents to research. There are several mechanisms at NIH that they could use to address these problems, but perhaps most importantly, Congress needs to address why physicians choose not to pursue science. Invariably, this is because of the overwhelming debt from medical school, which you have earlier today, that can average anywhere from $75,000 to $150,000. Physicians with large debts often leave their research careers behind, and pursue private practice, where debts can be more easily paid off. The next generation of physician scientists should not be selected on the basis of whether or not they have debts from medical school. Last year, Congress passed legislation that provided debt relief for physicians who do clinical research. We would request that Congress support expansion of this program to include all areas of biomedical science. If enacted, Congress would ensure that the quality of the scientist, and not his or her financial background, would determine the next generation of physician scientists. Mr. Regula. Was this debt relief on student loans, Federal supported loans? Dr. Martin. Yes, it is for medical school. It was part of an omnibus package last year. This was specifically the Clinical Research Enhancement Act. The second issue that I wish to bring to your attention is that of chronic obstructed pulmonary disease, or COPD. COPD is a collection of airway disorders, including emphysema, that are progressive and fatal. An estimated 16 million Americans have COPD, and another 16 million Americans are undiagnosed. COPD affects twice as many Americans as diabetes, and is the Nation's fourth leading cause of death. In the April issue of ``Scientific American,'' which I was just reading on my way here, it is noted that the mortality rate for heart disease and stroke for the past 20 years has declined by more than 50 percent. In contrast, in this same article, the mortality for COPD has increased by 34 percent. Surprisingly, little is known about how COPD develops. Genetics may provide important clues. We know that of all long- term smokers, only 15 percent develop COPD. This is something that shows that some people are disposed to the disease. We also do not fully understand the role of genetics in other types of airway diseases, such as asthma. More research into COPD will likely help us understand why certain people with asthma also develop progressive and irreversible disease. In approximately two weeks, April 4th, an important document will be released by NHLBI and the World Health Organization called GOLD, that provides for the world community what can be done for COPD. We need break-through research to understand why people develop COPD and to effectively reduce the morbidity and mortality associated with airway diseases. The third issue is tuberculosis. Tuberculosis is an airborne infection that primarily affects the lungs, but can also affect other body parts, such as the brain, kidneys, and spine. TB is spread by coughing and sneezing. There are over 18,000 active cases of tuberculosis in the United States. The Institute of Medicine recently published a report that documents the cycles of attention and progress toward tuberculosis elimination, followed by periods of insufficient funding, and the re-emergence of TB. The IOM report provides the U.S. with a road map of recommendations on how to eliminate TB in the U.S. The American Lung Association and the American Thoracic Society endorse the IOM report and its recommendations. Representatives Brown, Morella, and Waxman will soon introduce legislation to give NIH and CDC the authority and resources to implement the IOM report. Thank you. [The information follows:] [GRAPHIC(S) NOT AVAILABLE IN TIFF FORMAT] Mr. Regula. Well, thank you. This shows a connection between the lungs and the heart. I am not sure how this is different from just an ordinary heart problem. Dr. Martin. I am sorry, in reference to COPD? Mr. Regula. Yes. Dr. Martin. Well, with COPD, although people with advanced COPD develop heart failure, and it is a complication, the vast majority of people with COPD die a slow respiratory death. Mr. Regula. Then it obviously would be connected with smoking? Dr. Martin. It is, and I think it does not always engender public support, when you consider a disease like COPD as being self-inflicted. Mr. Regula. Yes. Dr. Martin. But I would argue that every patient that I have ever taken care of with COPD acquired the addition to cigarettes when they were an adolescent, and typically under the age of 15. Mr. Regula. So that is the time to try to deal with the problem. Dr. Martin. Absolutely. Mr. Regula. I think you are right. It grieves me, when I drive past a high school, and I see these kids out there. Dr. Martin. Yes. Mr. Regula. You girls see that in your schools, do you not, and you wonder, why would you want to start? I do not know. Well, good luck to you. Dr. Martin. Thank you very much. Mr. Regula. Thank you, and we are sure glad to see you today. Dr. Martin. I bet. [Laughter.] Mr. Regula. The hearing is adjourned. Tuesday, March 27, 2001. TESTIMONY OF MEMBERS OF CONGRESS VARIOUS PROGRAMS AND PROJECTS WITNESS HON. JOSEPH CROWLEY, A REPRESENTATIVE IN CONGRESS FROM THE STATE OF NEW YORK Mr. Regula. Our first witness this morning is Mr. Joseph Crowley from the State of New York, who has some interest in various programs and projects. We try to limit you to five minutes. Good morning. Mr. Hoyer. Good morning, Mr. Chairman. I want to welcome the distinguished representative from the State of New York, Mr. Crowley. He's one of our outstanding members. Mr. Crowley. I thank Chairman Regula and my good friend, Mr. Hoyer, but also the Ranking Member, Mr. Obey, for granting me this opportunity to testify before the Subcommittee on Labor, Health and Human Services and Education Appropriations, to discuss some of my key priorities. To best communicate the needs of my district, I would like to present my remarks in three specific parts. They are educational priorities, strengthening of public health infrastructure and improving the quality of life for the people of Queens and the Bronx in New York. Regarding education, I believe it is imperative that our society continue to invest in our children and in our public schools. I recently conducted a study of the schools in my Congressional district that documented how almost every child in the public school system is being taught in classrooms that are nearly 100 percent over capacity. Unfortunately, this situation is all too common in school districts throughout New York City, and unfortunately more so throughout our Nation. In these types of environments, the teacher's ability to teach becomes seriously altered. For these reasons, old teaching methods and techniques do not always prepare young teachers for real life situations that occur in inner city school classrooms every day. As a response, the City University of New York has launched a teacher empowerment zone, which is a major effort to improve teacher training programs. The program would create virtual classrooms with teachers teaching students to observe during the course of their study, in addition to other traditional learning tools. A student enrolled in the teaching program would have the opportunity to monitor a real classroom with the use of digital technology and at the end of the class period, engage in a dialogue with the teacher of the class to discuss the events that have occurred. One of the sites of the program would be at LaGuardia Community College, part of the City University of New York system. This school is centrally located at a transit hub that links Queens, the most ethnically diverse borough in the City of New York, with the world's center of finance, commerce and of arts. The College provides access to higher education and serves New Yorkers of all backgrounds, ages and means. For its part in the teacher empowerment zone, LaGuardia Community College has launched a major campus-wide initiative to expand the educational use of digital technology and is prepared to focus particular attention on the interlocking issues of technology in instruction and assessment. For this project, I am requesting $2.8 million. This money would be used to improve the infrastructure and provide the faculty development needed to advance this initiative. Additionally, funding would be used to improve and expand classroom connectivity, create links to local secondary schools, upgrade available software and enhance professional development programs. This is a worthwhile and creative program that deserves Federal assistance. To continue to build on our children's potential, I am also seeking assistance for the Queensborough Public Library to expand its Jackson Heights Queens branch. The Queensborough Public Library has the highest circulation of any library system in the United States, and spends more money per capita on books than any other major urban library system in our country. The funding I seek will not only expand the Jackson Heights branch, but will also provide greater access of materials to patrons, provide resources for new children's programs, and allow for more computers, offering free access to the electronic information. Furthermore, there is one more additional educational program I would like to touch on that I did not include in my prepared remarks. The Taft Institute at Queens College, which is also my alma mater, the Taft Institute was founded in 1961 to honor Ohio Senator Robert Taft's exemplary record of public service and political courage. The Taft Institute is a non- partisan enterprise dedicated to promoting informed citizen participation in the United States and around the world. In 1996, the Taft Institute chose Queens College of the City University of New York as the site of its national headquarters. This institute strives to reverse the mounting trend of citizen apathy and cynicism. Its programs reflect the conviction that true democracy requires that each new generation of citizens be committed to civic involvement. At a time when the high water mark of political involvement, the simple act of casting a ballot, scarcely reaches 50 percent, the need for such a program should be self-evident. Yet the unexamined, often unspoken premise persists that active citizenship will somehow emerge spontaneously in adulthood without prior learning or experience. The Taft Institute takes the opposite view. Responsible citizenship must be fostered from the earliest age. To thisend, the Institute has created a program of professional development to inspire and empower the teachers who will help to shape America's political future. Funding for Taft Institute programs comes from both public and private sources. While private sector funding has significantly increased in recent years, the Institute seeks new sources of support to continue and expand the innovative civic education programs essential to our country. Among its distinguished fellows would be our Speaker, Dennis Hastert, just to name one. I hope that we can work together for this important program, and I am therefore reaching out to this Congress and this Committee for $300,000 for this important institute. With regard to the health concerns of New Yorkers and all Americans, I want to inform the Committee that last Thursday, I sent a letter to President Bush requesting at least $25 million for the Centers for Disease Control. These funds would be used to monitor, detect and combat West Nile encephalitis, a disease that originated in my Congressional district, but has since spread throughout the eastern seaboard. I was pleased to be joined by 43 other Northeastern members of Congress in this effort to ensure that adequate attention and resources are provided to combating this mosquito-borne virus. Additionally, I will be asking the Committee to provide the needed resources to combat sexually transmitted diseases including HIV and AIDS. Here I urge a two-pronged attack, one globally based and one locally based. On the prevention side, I would appreciate if the Committee would highlight the need for funding of microbicide testing. Microbicides would fill a gap in the range of prevention tools because they are woman controlled and could protect against various STDs, not just HIV. These user controlled products that kill or inactivate the bacteria in viruses that cause STDs and HIV-AIDS are the only hope to prevent the transmission for many women overseas and even some here in our own country. Locally, I seek funding for an innovative program in my district to combat sexually transmitted disease, including HIV- AIDS in the often overlooked minority community. While the rate of HIV-AIDS infections is decreasing in the white population, it has drastically increased in the African American and Latino populations. Finally, as the representative of the middle and working class districts in northwestern Queens and the southeastern Bronx, I would like to discuss some specific needs of my constituents. Among these needs are for the young adults of Queens and the Bronx. Therefore, I am working to secure vital dollars for additional computers for a job training center at the Queens Bridge Homes, America's largest public housing unit. In these uncertain economic times, these dollars are needed now more than ever to assure the support and strength of this job training and skill providing site. Oftentimes, public housing is seen as a trap of despair, but Queens Bridge is different. It has been successful in utilizing the full potential of residents to keep it safe and full of promise. I hope to build on the existing job training and educational center at Queens Bridge, so as to harness all the abilities of the people of this community. For my older constituents, I am working for two senior centers in my district that are in need of assistance. First, the Sunnyside Community Services Senior Center in Sunnyside, Queens, which seeks capital project funding to make their center both disability accessible and more senior friendly. While my office is working with them and the city and the State of New York for funding, a shortfall is expected, and I hope this Congress will be able to provide some funding for this important senior center. Additionally, I will be championing the cause of the seniors of North Flushing Senior Center, a center as familiar to Representative Lowey as it is to myself. Last year, a funding shortfall almost caused havoc at this important community organization. I hope that working together, we can ensure that meals are always provided and the good works of that institution will continue well into the future. There are a great many other needs in my community and throughout our global community for assistance. I thank you, Chairman Regula, for your time, and my good friend, Steny Hoyer, for being here and taking the time to listen to some of my priorities. [The information follows:] [GRAPHIC(S) NOT AVAILABLE IN TIFF FORMAT] Mr. Regula. Thank you. Quick question. The superintendent of New York, I heard him speak at a seminar, sounds like an impressive regime that he's installed. What do you think? Mr. Crowley. In terms of? Mr. Regula. The New York City school system. Is it Mr. Levy? Mr. Crowley. The chancellor. Yes, I think he's an impressive individual, and someone who has been able to work with not only both sides of the aisle, so to speak, but really work within all the different communities of New York. The one thing that he's been grappling with and we've all been grappling with has been class size, and the problem with school modernization and overcrowding, the lack thereof in schools. In my district particularly, we're faced with the fact that the average school age is 50 years of age, and one out of every two schools is 75 years or older. Mr. Regula. He mentioned it. Mr. Crowley. These are real problems. In Queens County, we expect to be between 30,000 and 50,000 seats shy by the year 2007. So forget about a school building, there's not actually a seat for these young people to sit in. That's a real crisis that we're facing in the New York city public school system. But Chancellor Levy is doing all he can. Mr. Regula. Sounds like an interesting approach. Mr. Hoyer? Mr. Hoyer. I have no questions, I'd like to thank Congressman Crowley for obviously a very thoughtful presentation, dealing with a number of different areas of critical concern to his district, and frankly, to the country. Mr. Crowley. Thank you. Thank you both. Mr. Regula. We'll give you the forms, if you don't have them, to make a formal request. Mr. Crowley. Thank you very much. ---------- Tuesday, March 27, 2001. EDUCATIONAL AND HEALTHCARE PROGRAMS WITNESS HON. BILL PASCRELL, A REPRESENTATIVE IN CONGRESS FROM THE STATE OF NEW JERSEY Mr. Regula. Our next will be Mr. Pascrell of New Jersey, Education and Health. Summarize as much as you can. We have a long list today. Mr. Pascrell. Mr. Chairman, thanks for extending the courtesy to us, and members of this great Committee. Just a week ago, I was here with Thelma Thiel, if you remember, the President of the Hepatitis Foundation, and you were so kind to her, and I thank you for that. Today I want to talk about two subjects, education and health care, if I may. As a former teacher, I know the impact that large classroom sizes have on student performance. The quality of our children's education is largely dependent upon a strong teaching work force. According to the United States Department of Education, the Nation will need 1 million new teachers by the year 2010. Similar to what's happening to teachers is happening to nurses in America, as you well know. The looming shortage is already creating problems for school districts across the country. Even in advance of the peak of the shortage, school administrators are already reporting tremendous difficulties in recruiting qualified teachers. We can't get science and math teachers, they're moving into other areas that are obviously, will put more money in their pocket, to be very honest with you. While this is certainly a national problem, New Jersey, Mr. Chairman, particularly is plagued by the mass exodus of qualified teachers who are retiring. We rank among the top five States in the Nation for projected growth, however, in the student population. The number of high school graduates in the State is expected to increase by 25 percent in the year 2008. That's not a long way off. Mr. Chairman, the numbers do not tell the whole story here. Unless the new members of the teaching force are well educated, well prepared and unless current teachers' knowledge and skills are updated and honed, our Nation's need for quality educators will not be met. A compelling and growing body of research shows that the single greatest determinant of student achievement is teacher quality. New and experienced teachers alike are educating an increasingly diverse population with many different languages and cultural backgrounds. Mr. Regula. If I could interrupt you there. If you had a priority choice between more pay, upgrading skills versus reducing classroom size, assuming you can't do both, which would you opt for? Mr. Pascrell. Qualified teachers. Mr. Regula. That's my inclination, too, that that's number one, is to have qualified teachers. Mr. Pascrell. I can recommend a book, and I don't want to take more time, Mr. Chairman, you've been more than fair with me, but the book, Thomas Jefferson's Children, excellent book on education, provides reforms that are succinct and we can all understand. I recommend it. Mr. Regula. Thank you. Mr. Pascrell. Schools of education must meet the needs of this diverse student population and the needs of our technologically advancing world. That's why we wired our schools. The university in my district has been working on this problem. Montclair State University, 90 years in business, has built a nationally recognized teacher education program. Currently, Montclair graduates approximately 300 teacher candidates a year. It also turns away hundreds of qualified students each year, because of an acute shortage of space at the university. To alleviate this problem and to help the State and the entire Nation create more teachers, Montclair State is building a $45 million center for teacher preparation and technology. State of the art, authentic, not money thrown to the wind. The new center will allow the university to increase the number of teacher candidates it graduates each year by 60 percent. It will also allow the university to increase the number of masters degrees it awards to teachers already in the field, a critical component of teacher retention. While increasing in number of teachers, the center for teacher preparation and technology will make certain these teachers are competent in incorporating instructional technology into their teaching. This center will include interactive distance education equipment, wireless technology, full internet access and applications and hardware to keep track of student progress more effectively. This is supported bipartisanly, Mr. Chairman. Montclair State will receive $5 million from the State of New Jersey. It is asking Congress for $5 million to complete this critical project. And the rest of the money will be raised by the University itself. There are numerous pieces of legislation that call for an increase of teachers in the coming years. I believe, Mr. Chairman, this is a good project. I ask the Committee to take a look at it. Ask me any questions if you will. I think it's worthy, because it goes to the very heart of what we're talking about in education. The second project is a 21st Century institute for medical rehabilitation research. During the last cycle, my colleagues, Frelinghuysen, Payne, Rothman and Andrews and I asked this Committee for $3.9 million. Congress provided $775,000 of that amount. I'm here today to ask for the remaining funds, Mr. Chairman. This Committee has long recognized the extraordinary value and promise of medical research. You have demonstrated that time and time again with your support for increases in funding to NIH. All Americans should be grateful for this action as you are bringing all of us new hope for key breakthroughs in medicine and treatment. Up until now, this area has not seen the kinds of increases that many others have enjoyed and the need remains substantial in the area of rehabilitation medicine and research. One of the premier institutions in the country in the rehabilitation research field is in my district, the Kessler Medical Rehabilitation Research and Education Corporation, and the Kessler Rehab Hospital are widely regarded as leaders nationally in rehab medicine, treatment and research. Much more can and must be done to accelerate and build on the work which is already underway. So several years ago, the Kessler organization decided to create a new and unique effort in the United States. This was it, this was pro forma for the rest of what has happened since. Last year, your Subcommittee recommended funding for this effort. I'm deeply grateful, Kessler is deeply grateful. One area of rehab that I am particularly involved in, and interested in, we've done work in other areas, is the traumatic brain injury. We now have a registration list which is very critical. Kessler is dealing with this problem, Mr. Chairman. Two million Americans experience a traumatic brain injury every year. Two million. About half of these cases result in at least short term disability. Eighty thousand people sustain severe brain injuries, leading to long term disability. Most people with a brain injury must experience some type of rehab in order to function in their daily lives. So Mr. Chairman, to make a long story short, I ask for these two projects, and I think they're worthy projects, and I've come to the right Committee. [The information follows:] [GRAPHIC(S) NOT AVAILABLE IN TIFF FORMAT] Mr. Regula. Well, we'll probably get a better estimate of that later in the year. [Laughter.] Thank you. Is Kessler tied with NIH in any way? Mr. Pascrell. Yes, much of the dollars comes from NIH. It's probably the premier institution in the country. Mr. Regula. So it works with them? Mr. Pascrell. A lot of breakthroughs, Mr. Chairman. Mr. Regula. Your education institution that you mentioned, is that a State university? Mr. Pascrell. Yes. Montclair State University is a State university. Mr. Regula. Mr. Hoyer. Mr. Hoyer. No questions. Thank you. Mr. Regula. Thank you for coming. Mr. Pascrell. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. ---------- Tuesday, March 27, 2001. NATIONAL CENTER FOR INJURY PREVENTION AND CONTROL WITNESS HON. MICHAEL HONDA, A REPRESENTATIVE IN CONGRESS FROM THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA Mr. Regula. Mr. Honda, we're ready for you. Glad you came. Mr. Hoyer. Mr. Chairman, as you know, Mr. Honda is one of our newer members, but a very experienced member, a distinguished member of the general assembly in California, and does an outstanding job. Mr. Honda. Does that mean I get a raise? Mr. Regula. Do you take any responsibility for the rolling blackouts? Mr. Honda. No, not yet. I take the responsibility of helping, though. Mr. Regula. It's a tough issue out there. Mr. Honda. Yes, it is. Not to be funny, though, there may be light at the end of the tunnel. Mr. Chairman, thank you very much for allowing me to testify here. I want to thank Mr. Hoyer for acknowledging my presence also. Distinguished members of the Subcommittee, thank you for this opportunity to testify today. I'm here to respectfully request your assistance on a very important initiative that affects millions of Americans. Specifically, I'm asking you to consider an additional $1.5 million for the National Center for Injury Prevention and Control at the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, to address a very important topic, sleep deprivation and fatigue related injury. I think many people smile when they hear the term sleep and fatigue, because they probably just pooh-pooh it and say that it's something that doesn't seem to be very important. Mr. Regula. We had a public witness, an M.D., that spoke at length about that, runs a couple of clinics back in Ohio. Mr. Honda. Right. Mr. Regula. So it is, and I think the NIH has done some work, is doing work on the impact. Mr. Honda. Right. We just need to do more work in the public domain to sort of raise the issue. I appreciate this opportunity. Sleep represents a third of every person's life. It has a tremendous impact on how we live, function, perform, and think during the other two-thirds of our lives. Lack of adequate, restful sleep has serious consequences at home, in the workplace, at school and on the highway. Untreated sleep disorders, of which there are more than 80, and sleep deprivation contributes to injuries, impaired work productivity, academic performance, reduced quality of life, poor health and even death. As a teacher, a school principal and school board member, I have seen sleep deprivation as a growing problem for high school students, the largest at-risk group for fall-asleep car crashes, as well as being a factor in causing car accidents for parents, transportation workers, police officers and medical residents. According to the National Sleep Foundation, the direct or indirect cost to the United States economy due to sleep disorders and sleep deprivation are estimated to exceed $100 billion each year. As someone with a sleep disorder myself, I know these problems all too well. I am one of the approximately 40 million Americans who suffers from chronic sleep disorder. I was diagnosed with obstructive sleep apnea, which is a very common sleep and breathing disorder that affects at least 12 million Americans. Each time a person with sleep apnea stops breathing, sometimes up to 400 times a night in severe cases, and I was one of them, the brain awakens the person just enough to get them breathing again. What I learned is that when you stop breathing, the chemistry of your blood changes, and it clicks off in your brain to say, wake up, dummy, wake up. That's when you hear folks just gasping for breath in the middle of the night, and then they continue to sleep. This allows them to go into deep sleep, what they call REM, where they get that rest, but they continue to appear to be sleeping, to get their rest, but they don't get that deep rest. This not only affects the quality of a person's sleep and daytime functioning, but it leads to very serious health problems. Untreated sleep apnea has been linked to hypertension, cardiovascular disease, diabetes, depression, memory problems, obesity and other serious problems. I am very lucky, because unlike most undiagnosed Americans with sleep disorders, I have a nationally recognized physician, Dr. William DeMent, who was able to treat my sleep disorders. And the diagnosis and proper sleep treatment definitely has improved the quality of my life immeasurably. I say, Mr. Chairman, that it's a malady that can be cured overnight. While public awareness is desperately needed, a strong Federal partner with expertise and ability to disseminate tested and proven education training and injury prevention programs to communities throughout the Nation is needed even more. The CDC can help us address the comprehensive and complex health and safety problems related to sleep issues by developing a sleep awareness action plan that would set national priorities around sleep issues in public health and safety. This five year sleep awareness action plan would develop the evaluative research including daily collection through the National Center for Injury Prevention and Control and others at the CDC. The research would include an attempt to validate or improve existing surveys and survey methodologies regarding how sleep deprivation problems are related to the on the job injuries, highway crashes and other medical conditions, such as diabetes, heart disease, cancer and obesity. The data from this research will allow the CDC to devote accurate educational material and model prevention and health promotion programs to provide to States as they address these important issues. This information will begin to turn the tide of injuries, health programs and costs associated with sleepiness and sleep disorders. So as I sit here today, I'm happy to report that I am feeling fine. But I want all of you to know that it has taken hard work with my doctor, reprioritizing with my family and my life. I hope that you all take the time you need to get the quality sleep you need every night. As a new member of Congress, I am quickly learning that our schedules are so packed and our days are so long that you are probably not getting all the sleep that you need, but getting sufficient sleep should not be optional. I just want to close by thanking you for the opportunity to testify today, and I look forward to working with the group and providing myself as a personal testimony to the issue of sleep disorders and fatigue, as it relates not only to adults and sleep disorders, but also fatigue as it relates to young people who are coming to a point where, especially seniors that are coming to graduation. We see too many youngsters who fall asleep at the wheel because of fatigue. It doesn't have to be disorders, it's just our attitude toward sleep and sleep deprivation. [The information follows:] [GRAPHIC(S) NOT AVAILABLE IN TIFF FORMAT] Mr. Regula. I think you're suggesting that CDC needs to do a major public information campaign to make people aware that this is a problem that's curable. Mr. Honda. That's correct. Succinctly put, Mr. Chairman. We're looking for support of $1.5 million. Mr. Regula. We're going to be visiting there next week, so it will be a good question for us to raise. Mr. Hoyer, questions? Mr. Hoyer. No, I have no questions. Thank you, Mr. Honda. Mr. Regula. Thank you for coming. Mr. Honda. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. ---------- Tuesday, March 27, 2001. PROJECTS WITNESS HON. ROBERT FILNER, A REPRESENTATIVE IN CONGRESS FROM THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA Mr. Regula. Mr. Filner. Mr. Hoyer. I pledge to Mr. Filner that I will read every sentence of your statement. Mr. Filner. I just want you to give me the money. [Laughter.] Mr. Regula. Welcome, Mr. Filner. Mr. Filner. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. And we all appreciate your--and the staff and as many members as possible--sitting through and listening to all these requests. We do appreciate it and thank you so much. I bring forward to you two proposals that are important to my district, my constituency, but I think also serve as models for broader application to similar situations in other parts of our Nation. First is a $3.9 million appropriation for Paradise Valley Hospital to create what is called a complementary medical center, and therefore address health needs of a minority population that is often overlooked. Your Committee provided about $700,000 for this center in the last appropriation. This would allow them to actually set up and begin services in this complementary medical center. It would be a unique showcase of how public and private health care enterprise can cooperate, because it would provide needed specialty care to an under-served community which then could be replicated throughout the country. What we have in Paradise Hospital is the only community hospital in our county. It serves not only the whole county, but it is located in the fourth poorest city in California, National City, one of the cities I represent. In fact, the thirteenth poorest city in the Nation. And it is truly a safety net provider, but has not been able to provide the kind of complementary health care that wealthier medical centers can. Mr. Regula. Is this a non-profit or a city facility, or State? Mr. Filner. It's a non-profit hospital, but it's a private hospital. It's in the Adventist medical chain of facilities. As I said, the complementary nature or the complementary medical techniques have been available to wealthier communities, but have never really been given in a holistic way or in a very comprehensive way to disadvantaged populations. What we have in mind here is to showcase that when these services are provided to even poorer communities, they will have a very much enhanced medical care and in fact save us, of course, as a Nation, money in the long run. So again, you have provided some startup money for this in the last appropriation cycle. The money that I would ask for now would allow them to actually set up the center. In my second request, I am joined by my colleague, Congresswoman Susan Davis from San Diego. We are asking that the senior community center of San Diego be funded for a demonstration program, $250,000 for Title IV of the Older Americans Act, to establish a demonstration project entitled Health Promotion/Harm Reduction. What this is for is seniors, a growing number of seniors, who have emotional or mental health problems, to help them before they get more seriously ill or in fact, thrown out on the street into homelessness. The only organization in San Diego to provide at-risk seniors is the senior community centers. They have shown in an 18 month test that if they provide intensive case management services in conjunction with nutrition services, the self-reliance of this population is greatly increased. So with just $250,000, they think they can in fact decrease emergency medical interventions, reduce medical costs to our community, get early treatment of illness and thus allow seniors to have an independent and healthy lifestyle. These are two areas, again, for San Diego, mainly in poor communities for a population that is under-served, as you well know. Mr. Regula. Is the senior unit a private, non-profit? Mr. Filner. It's a non-profit also. Mr. Regula. It's not operated by your senior groups? Mr. Filner. It's not operated by the city government. It's a private non-profit. Again, these services, we believe of course not only will help our specific population, but serve as good models for other places in the country. So that's what I have before you, Mr. Chairman. I thank you for the time. [The information follows:] [GRAPHIC(S) NOT AVAILABLE IN TIFF FORMAT] Mr. Regula. Thank you for bringing this to our attention. ---------- Tuesday, March 27, 2001. IMPACT AID AND CROHN'S AND LYME DISEASE WITNESS HON. SUE W. KELLY, A REPRESENTATIVE IN CONGRESS FROM THE STATE OF NEW YORK Mr. Regula. The next witness is Representative Congresswoman Sue Kelly from New York. Sue, on Impact Aid, Crohn's and Lyme Disease. Ms. Kelly. That's a polyglot, isn't it? Mr. Regula. You have quite a list. Ms. Kelly. I brought this map, because I want to show you this map. This map shows you the area, actually, of West Point. And this little tiny strip, this little tiny strip outlined in red right there, this all belongs in one township. This little tiny strip of land, which represents about not quite 7 percent of all of the land in this---- Mr. Regula. It's the Hudson River, I assume. Ms. Kelly. This is the Hudson River. Right there, bounded by the Hudson River, that's all the land that this township has that they can use for any kind of tax purposes at all to support the school system. This is the most highly impacted school system in the Nation, here at West Point. Mr. Regula. Is that all West Point? Ms. Kelly. This is all West Point. Mr. Regula. How many acres would be in that? Ms. Kelly. West Point? I don't know. I should know. I'm the Vice Chairman of the West Point Board, I should know, but I don't. [Laughter.] But the thing I'm trying to point out here is that these people can't grow. This is mountain in here. So they have mountainous areas in here, they have the river over here. Mr. Regula. Is that a school district? Ms. Kelly. There is a school district here, and the students who are taught in grade school on the Point come out into this school district for their high school. Mr. Regula. So the Point doesn't operate a high school? Ms. Kelly. It doesn't operate a high school, a junior high, high school. They come out into this district for their high school. Mr. Regula. That would be all the personnel that operate it. Ms. Kelly. All the civilian and military personnel. And remember, this is an active base as well. All those people send their kids out here into this little area to this high school. Years ago, this high school was properly funded. And I'm talking about Section 8002. This is the most highly impacted district in the Nation. We've got to have our Impact Aid. Because years ago, we can get a copy of that for you if you want. Years ago, this was fully funded and we had enough funding coming in there to help the school district. When I was elected, that school district was teaching social studies out of a book that stopped at the Vietnam War. That was six years ago. These kids had very old books, they had teachers that were leaving, their teachers hadn't had any advanced training, the school buildings themselves were in terrible shape. And this school district was a threatened school district. There it is, sandwiched between the Point, the river and mountains. They can't grow, they've got nothing to tax. They need our help. We've got to have that money that we had, at least what we had last year if not more. We really do need an increase. But since we've been working---- Mr. Regula. Does that go out by formula? Ms. Kelly. Yes, it goes out by formula. I'm just trying to locate it and see. Mr. Regula. Does it depend on the per capital wealth of the district as to how much they get? Ms. Kelly. You can imagine, if it's a military base, you know the state of what the military gets paid. Mr. Regula. On the portion that they tax. Do you use real estate taxes in New York for schools? Ms. Kelly. We use real estate taxes for schools, but there's no place to tax. This is very, there's only so much of that land you can use, because people live there, too. There's housing. Mr. Regula. What I'm getting at is, the Impact Aid is predicated on the amount of available tax revenues within a district. So Impact Aid would vary from place to place depending on the wealth of the district that's involved. What you're saying is you need more, either change the formula or more money to this district. Ms. Kelly. I need more money in this district. We need a better formula for taking--now, there's 8002, which is land based, and I'm talking about land based right now, because---- Mr. Regula. Staff tells me you went from 32 million to 40 million last year. So apparently we do control in the Committee the macro amount that goes to each of the districts. Ms. Kelly. You do, yes, absolutely. Mr. Regula. That's what I was trying to determine, is it formula, and the answer is no. It's just a judgment call. Ms. Kelly. Well, correct me if I'm wrong, sir, but I think perhaps there is a formula for one part of this. It's the per capita student part that has a formula. Then the part I'm talking about does not. Mr. Regula. Kind of an enrichment. Ms. Kelly. It is something to make up for the fact that the land was taken by the Federal Government. The Point didn't used to be that large. But for one reason or another, during the various wars, they've added land in because they need it for training. And as they've added land in, endingit for training, they've eaten into the township. Mr. Regula. Does the Point train any other than cadets? Do they have other training facilities there? You mentioned that it was more than just a military academy. Ms. Kelly. It's an active Army base as well. Mr. Regula. That's what I'm saying, do they train troops there? Ms. Kelly. I don't know if we train--we train specified things. They run mountaineering courses, they do some other things. Plus they have some, if I remember correctly, I know we have a mint there, there's a number of Federal activities that are going on at the Point and a lot of people working there and living there on the Point. The thing is, what we got last year wasn't even 50 percent of what basically we are entitled to under what we were promised when the Point's land was taken, when the Point took our land. So from an Impact Aid standpoint, we really, I really need to help these people. Because what's happened, because we got that increase, we now have teachers who are coming back into the district. We are training the teachers, we have bought new books, there's a social worker to help the kids, which we've never had before, and we really need not only that, but the school has a new roof over part of it, so that now they can use that part of the school. It was really raining in. So it's not money gone to waste. It's good money, we need to do it. And we really need to have a full funding. I'll take 50 percent, that's $62 million, but it's the second step of a promise that we have made in the past to this school district. And Impact Aid all across the Nation needs our help. But this is the most highly impacted district in the Nation. I want to go quickly to a couple of other things that I have on the ticket here. Because we can talk further if you'd like about the Impact Aid. I want to talk about Crohn's disease. Crohn's disease is an inflammatory bowel disease. Mr. Regula. We had some public witnesses on that. Not here today, but in the past couple of weeks. Ms. Kelly. It encompasses a whole group of diseases. There's about a million people in the United States who have this disease. It is economically and physically debilitating for people. I know about that, because my daughter has Crohn's disease. Mr. Regula. You're asking for more money on research on this? Ms. Kelly. I want you to designate more money to research. I know you can't tag it that way, but I'd like report language that really strongly recommends NIH do something to put more money into research for Crohn's. It's on the increase, and it is very debilitating. People who have Crohn's disease have the option of losing a part of their intestine or sometimes all of their intestine. The disease can come from your mouth to your anus. It blocks off your ability to allow food to get through your gut, and then what happens is you go, what happens to a lot of people with Crohn's disease is they get sick, they have an operation and they lose a piece of something. They are fine for a while, they get sick, they have an operation, they lose another piece of something. Pretty soon, there's not much left between their mouth and their anus, and they live with a feeding tube if they live at all. It's a very serious disease, it's on the increase, and we are paying very little attention to the people who have Crohn's disease. We need to give them some hope and we need to do some research. I hope that you will think about putting some strong report language in about that. Mr. Regula. We will have NIH before us, and your concern is that we just get more money into research to try to find cures. Ms. Kelly. There are some interesting ideas about cures. Dr. Crohn actually lived in my district before he died. And he is the person who identified this disease that was killing people and no one knew what it was. But from his identification, from that point onward, there's been very little attention paid to it. It's one of these diseases that people just simply don't pay a lot of attention to. Just like Lyme disease, which is the other thing that brought me here today. I could talk about a couple of other things, like juvenile diabetes and so forth. But Lyme disease, the epicenter of Lyme is in my district. So I'm here for three causes: Impact Aid, which I care ardently about; Crohn's disease, which is in my family; and Lyme disease, which I have had. We are in the epicenter of it, we need to have---- Mr. Regula. Is this the deer---- Ms. Kelly. Deer ticks, yes. And we have some ideas about what we can do to stop the transmission of Lyme. We need money for research. We have come up with a vaccine that works, but it doesn't work on people over 60 or under 10, as far as I know, from what their research has shown. So we can't vaccinate our very young. And it's a debilitating disease. Many people are left permanently disabled because of Lyme disease. So from a long range standpoint, it's a very expensive disease. Mr. Regula. It's tick-borne, and the deer is the host? Ms. Kelly. The deer are a host for the tick. The tick is actually the host of the spirochete that causes the disease. There is now three identified diseases, but it's only the deer tick I'm talking about. There's also the reketsial diseases that are borne by dog ticks. That's the Rocky Mountain spotted fever and so on. We have cases of Rocky Mountain spotted fever that have been on Long Island last year. It used to be only in the Rocky Mountains. Now that is spreading. We need research on tick-borne diseases, both reketsial diseases and the spirochete diseases, because we don't understand completely how to stop them. And they are walking right straight through our Nation. I'm chairman of the Lyme Disease Caucus. We have a number of people, I've had several of our colleagues come up to me on the Floor saying, let me get on your caucus, my wife just got Lyme disease, because it is very prevalent in the midwest, it's prevalent on the coast and in the mountainous areas and the Rocky Mountains and out in California and Oregon and Washington. But it's most prevalent, and the epicenter is in the northeast. We need your help. Mr. Regula. I remember you telling me about it. It doesn't seem to have impacted in Ohio yet, but it will probably get there. Ms. Kelly. That's perhaps because the doctors don't know how to identify it. One of the biggest problems we have is that doctors don't understand what they're looking at. They know they have a disease and they can treat it with a broadspectrum, heavy duty antibiotic, and sometimes if it's a mild case, it will knock it out. And they think, well, didn't quite identify it, but I got it. So the patient is better. Part of what we need to do is use this money for educating the doctors and the other part for doing the research needed to stop the disease itself. We can do it. Thank you. [The information follows:] [GRAPHIC(S) NOT AVAILABLE IN TIFF FORMAT] Mr. Regula. Thank you. Mr. Sherwood. Mr. Sherwood. What's the name of the school district? Ms. Kelly. The name of the school district is Highland Falls School District. Mr. Sherwood. What's the annual budget? Ms. Kelly. I don't know if I have it. I'll have to get back to you, because I don't remember. Mr. Sherwood. Do you have the cost per student per year? Ms. Kelly. I can give you a cost per student per year. I can also give you a per student, how much the Impact Aid means. We're talking about over a million dollars to this school district. And if we don't get it, that school district will fold. Mr. Sherwood. You mentioned $62 million. Ms. Kelly. Because this is what we've been asking for. This is the second step in what we had asked for originally and got started on. And a ten year program to bring the section 8002 funding into its full funding level. And that's only 50 percent that I'm asking for. Mr. Sherwood. But did you use the term $62 million? Ms. Kelly. I did, yes. We need to have the funding next year. We need to have the funding next year at $62 million, because this is what the school district has got to have. Mr. Sherwood. You mean that's their total budget or what you're asking for under Impact Aid? Ms. Kelly. No, this is for the total Impact Aid. Our school district gets a piece of that. But what we haven't had is 50 percent funding. We need to get it fully funded. Any one of us who represents an impacted district knows full well that without that funding, we're going to go down the tubes with these school districts. Since we have a President who's dedicated to education, we want to fund these schools. We need to. Mr. Sherwood. But doesn't the State of New York fund their participation in your school district on the wealth effect? In other words, the smaller your tax base, the higher percent you get from the State? That's the way it works in Pennsylvania. Ms. Kelly. We get some aid that way, but we have not gotten the school building aid that we needed. There's just not enough money to--we have New York City, as you know, that eats up the majority of our funding for our education budget. So we have not had that much. The people in this town, if you look at their income, this is not a wealthy town. It's a very, very--I hesitate to say low income, but it's lower middle income folks who live there. These people are people who are living on Government salaries because they work for West Point, they're the people who are the teachers at West Point or they're working on the base, and these are guys and women who are, you know, they're taking Government salaries. They don't have a lot of resources. And they don't have the money to put into the school itself, and there are not a lot of wealthy people who live in the surrounding area to put taxes in. Mr. Sherwood. Is there a local elected school board that makes the financial decisions? Ms. Kelly. We do have a local elected school board that makes those decisions, yes. Mr. Sherwood. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. Mr. Regula. Mr. Cunningham, any questions? Mr. Cunningham. Mr. Chairman, thank you. I'd just make a comment. I've worked with Ms. Kelly even when I was chairman of the Education Subcommittee on Authorization. I went to that area. Matter of fact, if you haven't made a trip to, West Point itself is underfunded, the military academy, compared to the other academies. If you look at the area around, she's not exaggerating. Impact Aid is critical to her particular district, more so than I think a lot of districts. Maybe not so much as mine---- [Laughter.] Mr. Cunningham [continuing]. But it is important. Having visited the area, it is, Impact Aid is very important to that area. Ms. Kelly. I thank you. Mr. Cunningham has worked very carefully with me, because he has been there, he's driven through the trailer parks that these people live in, and he knows full well that it's very important for us to get---- Mr. Regula. The trailer parks are on the West Point campus? Ms. Kelly. Not on the campus, sir, but they're outside in Highland Falls. That's where these folks can afford to live. Mr. Regula. Thank you for coming. ---------- Tuesday, March 27, 2001. IMPACT AID WITNESS HON. MARK STEVEN KIRK, A REPRESENTATIVE IN CONGRESS FROM THE STATE OF ILLINOIS Mr. Regula. Mr. Kirk from the State of Illinois, Impact Aid. We've heard that subject discussed here. Mr. Kirk. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. I'm here to basically underscore the point. I sit here as the successor to John Porter, so I with some trepidation testify before this Committee. Mr. Regula. You have Great Lakes, then, don't you? Mr. Kirk. I do. And I used to be sitting on the seats in the back row there very recently. So to be here is a real honor. For me, in our Congressional district, as far as the United States military in the midwest, we're about it. But boy, are we it. If you join the United States Navy, you're coming to the Tenth---- Mr. Regula. I spent some time in Great Lakes. Very familiar with it. Mr. Kirk. And now that all naval training is being concentrated there--well, we didn't steal it, we bought if fair and square. For us, now, at Great Lakes, we expect the recruit population will go from 50,000 to 70,000 in the coming four years. So as a member of the military family, it is only growing in our district. Mr. Regula. Is that the only one giving boot camp now? Mr. Kirk. That's it. Mr. Regula. For the whole USA? Mr. Kirk. For the surface fleet, right. With me is the actual superintendent of the district, 187 school district, Dr. Patricia Pickles. Mr. Chairman, with your permission, if I could have Dr. Pickles join me up here. Mr. Regula. Okay. Mr. Kirk. I actually stand in awe of Dr. Pickles and what she went through. As the Impact Aid situation worsened about four years ago, this Subcommittee rescued the program, and specifically district 187. We were looking at scenarios in which we would have to close down schools in north Chicago and send, bus the students to schools in surrounding school districts, which would have made no sense, because we had a perfectly functioning good school infrastructure there. But the structure of education funding did not allow us to meet the needs of the students. In our 187 school district, several others were approaching over 30 percent of the students coming from military housing. So this program is essential for our very survival, and will become increasingly essential. As Great Lakes expands its impact on all of the surrounding school districts will grow. I have a detailed statement, which with your permission---- Mr. Regula. All the statements will be part of the record. Mr. Kirk. I would just like to underscore a couple of key points. The military family that we know, I just left the fleet last year, so for me, I'm coming straight out of that environment. My last tour was in Operation Northern Watch. For us, we have seen, Charlie Muscow is a great academician at Northwestern University, who studies the cultural divide emerging between the active duty military and the civilian world, it's really expanding. And we see that in the kids. For us, we are expecting that about 50 percent of the recruits coming into today's military are from military families. So the children of the men and women who protect us today will be the people who protect our children tomorrow. With all of this concern about military pay, health care, housing and benefits, I would suggest we add one key component. And that is Impact Aid for military education. I made this point very forcefully with Secretary Rumsfeld, who is actually also the Congressman from our district. He represented our district in the 1960s. And with Secretary Paige, who made a very forceful statement in favor of Impact Aid before the House Budget Committee. That's the key point that I want to make, that these young leaders in these impacted schools will most likely be the military personnel of the future. That point needs to be made to support this program. [The information follows:] [GRAPHIC(S) NOT AVAILABLE IN TIFF FORMAT] Mr. Regula. Does Great Lakes impact on a number of school districts? Mr. Kirk. It does. For us it's North Chicago, Waukegan, Highland Park, Glen View, Lake Forest. Mr. Regula. And they all get a piece of the Impact Aid, then? Mr. Kirk. They do, but let me hand it over to Patricia. She has one of the, probably the most heavily impacted districts in the country. Ms. Pickles. Most of the students do attend North Chicago Public Schools, district 187, 35 percent of our student population---- Mr. Regula. Thirty-five percent of your student population is military? Ms. Pickles. Thirty-five percent. Mr. Regula. So Impact Aid is an important part of your budget? Ms. Pickles. Very important part. Over 72 percent of our student population qualifies for free and reduced meals. With that 35 percent, more than 200 of those students are identified as needing special needs, so they need special education, which is an additional burden in terms of cost. And as the Congressman stated, almost 10 years ago, our district almost dissolved because we didn't have the funds to support them due to the Federal presence. So we dearly need Impact Aid. Mr. Regula. All right, thank you. I know it's a tough situation, you heard Ms. Kelly. Mr. Kirk. As you all know, Chairman Porter spent a lot of time on this. It was no accident. And for us, I would expect that the size of the military under this Administration will grow. It's already growing in my district, so it's under those concerns that we look forward to supporting your legislation and supporting the program. Mr. Regula. Thank you. Mr. Kirk. Thank you. Mr. Cunningham. Mr. Chairman, could I ask one real quick question on it? San Diego does have a lot of military, as well as important in Impact Aid. You alluded to, as far as the special education, we have a hospital called Balboa there. Many times, military families seek orders that are close to those hospitals, because of their children and special education. Is that one of the reasons that military families are drawn there, because of the medical facility? Mr. Kirk. Yes, we are not only home to the Great Lakes Naval Hospital, we're also home to the North Chicago VA Medical Center, which, if you look at the morbidity and mortality statistics among DOD and military related health care facilities, is one of the best in the country. The taxpayers spent about $110 million there to bring that facility up to the state of the art. And that is an enormous attractive factor. What we've seen now, and it's just like, I just got off Dakani so I know the attractiveness of San Diego. But similarly, in northern Illinois, people like to, when they leave the service, remain with us. And it's because of those services. Mr. Cunningham. I know my sister-in-law just testified before the committees in charge of special education in San Diego City. I think it would be good to do a study on the relationship of military families, special education and Impact Aid, how it really affects the entire community. Mr. Kirk. Right. Mr. Cunningham. Because the original intent is to make sure that it didn't, with Native Americans or the military, and it does. So it's an area in which I think all of us, Republicans and Democrats, support. I don't see why we can't help. I don't know if we can help as much with budget, but I think we could do that. I was sworn in at Glen View Naval Air Station and I coached football at Insdale. So I'm very familiar with the area. Mr. Kirk. Gosh. Well, Mr. Chairman, as you know, since the military most likely will be growing, this program is one of the pieces of glue that allowed the community to welcome the military family and expansion in our districts. If expansion of Great Lakes means bankrupting the local school districts, we've got a problem on our hands. So thank you. Mr. Regula. Thank you. Mr. Sherwood, any questions? Mr. Sherwood. No, thank you. ---------- Tuesday, March 27, 2001. HEALTH PROJECTS WITNESS HON. LYNN WOOLSEY, A REPRESENTATIVE IN CONGRESS FROM THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA Mr. Regula. Next is Mrs. Woolsey from California. Any park issues today? Mrs. Woolsey. No park issues today, no, but there will be in the future, I can assure you. Mr. Regula. I'm quite sure. Mrs. Woolsey. Speaking of Impact Aid, that affects Park Service personnel also. Mr. Regula. True. Mrs. Woolsey. Thank you, Mr. Regula, for hearing me again, and thank you, members of the Committee, for giving me the opportunity to talk about five excellent education and health projects in my Congressional district. Some of you, well, you, Mr. Regula, Mr. Chairman, you heard my constituent, Dr. Sushma Taylor testify last week about Center Point, a non-profit comprehensive drug and alcohol treatment center. Center Point is one of a very few full service drug and alcohol treatment centers that provides comprehensive social, educational, vocational, medical, psychological, housing and rehab service. Mr. Regula. Do they take patients from all over the country or just in California? Mrs. Woolsey. Mainly in California, but I'm sure that they do tradeoffs with other areas in the country. Mr. Regula. But is it a private non-profit? Mrs. Woolsey. Private non-profit. Mr. Regula. Thank you. Mrs. Woolsey. But there's local funding, Federal funding, State funding involved. That's why again, I'm supporting their request for $1.8 million to purchase and equip an additional rehab center, and $1.5 million for their successful adolescent residential treatment program. Next, I'm very proud that I represent the only public four year university, Sonoma State University, serving the large six county region north of the San Francisco Bay. On behalf of Sonoma State University, I'm asking for $1 million for lab equipment for their masters program in computer and engineering sciences. I'm also requesting for them $1 million for their lifelong learning institute, which offers programs specifically tailored to the interests and needs of the North Bay senior population. The third request I have is an exciting new program in my district for Dominican University, a private university that serves minorities, women in great proportions and has one of the best diversities of any private institution that I know of in at least the North Bay, but probably in many parts of the country. What they have is, they're trying to develop a training and lifelong learning center to address the current shortage of math and science teachers, and to meet the need for health professionals in the Bay region and around the Nation. We don't have a number for their request at this moment, they came in with a huge number that would have wiped out all the rest of my requests, so we're asking them to come back with something else, and I'll provide that when I write my requests to you. Mr. Regula. If you have multiple requests, it would be helpful if you sort of prioritize them, because obviously we're not going to have enough funding to do everything everybody would like. Mrs. Woolsey. And Mr. Chairman---- Mr. Regula. So if we had your priorities, it would be helpful. Mrs. Woolsey. I appreciate that, and I am willing to do that. I also know that what we ask for we don't always get all of, but I sort of feel that if we get our nose under the tent and you see how well these programs work, then the next year we can build on that. One of the programs that we've had experience with in that regard is Yosemite National Institute, an institute that conducts institutionally rigorous hands-on environmental science programs in my district and elsewhere. One of Yosemite's highest priorities is to make these programs available to low income minority communities, those who traditionally have little access to quality, science-based education programs. That's why I support their request, Mr. Chairman, for $1 million to develop more outreach programs for this population. I'm also requesting, and behind me I have a whole group of people who came and met with me this morning, and I was already prepared to come here and they asked could they come with me, so they're back there. I'm requesting $2 million for the Sonoma County Health Care Information Network. It's a network that integrates local health information in order to improve the quality of local health care. Mr. Chairman, the Sixth District of California is a leader in meeting the health and education needs of the 21st century, and that's because I've been able to work with them and to get the support from our Federal Government and from your Committee to give them the help they need to be successful. So I thank you very much, and I thank the Subcommittee. I look forward to working with you. I will prioritize these requests. [The information follows:] [GRAPHIC(S) NOT AVAILABLE IN TIFF FORMAT] Mr. Regula. Thank you. I know that you did get some help last year. Mrs. Woolsey. I did. You've been good. And I appreciate your work. Mr. Regula. We'll see. Thank you. ---------- Tuesday, March 27, 2001. NATIONAL CENTER FOR SOCIAL WORK RESEARCH WITHIN NIH WITNESS HON. ASA HUTCHINSON, A REPRESENTATIVE IN CONGRESS FROM THE STATE OF ARKANSAS Mr. Regula. Okay, Mr. Hutchinson from the great State of Arkansas. You're interested in the National Center for Social Work Research with NIH. Mr. Hutchinson. That's correct, Mr. Chairman, and thank you for this opportunity to present the case for this. This is legislation I'm sponsoring with Congressman Rodriquez. It would create the national center for social work research within---- Mr. Regula. So it's a new regulation you would hope to get? Mr. Hutchinson. That's correct, it's new authorization. Even though the authorization has not yet passed, I wanted to alert you to the fact that we have introduced this legislation, we'll be asking for support for funding it. And this is within the National Institutes of Health, but they do some social work research, but it's not organized toward a national center. Presently, there is limited funding available through NIH, but this would emphasize the importance and urgency of research on social problems from child abuse to juvenile violence. It would give researchers more guidance, it would change the hard data into effective policy recommendations. Funding appropriated to a national center for social work research would be used for grants to universities and other non-profit organizations to support ongoing research, national coordination and dissemination efforts and to cooperate with legislators of Government, every level. I think a national center is needed to address some very important issues. As a father of four and new grandfather, I am concerned about the next generation. And some questions that could be asked, why does our system not work better to prevent violence in our schools? Why has there been a increase in child abuse today over 50 years ago? Is there a reason for the occurrences of child abuse being on the rise? Are there societal pressures on parents that didn't exist even 10 years ago? What can we do to help these families? I don't have the answers to those questions. And I think that that is the reason this is needed, and I daresay with great respect for this panel that you might not have the answers to all of those questions. So social workers are the professionals who can give us insight into those areas. I was struck by a recent Rand health study on youth violence, which stated that ``to devise better programs, researchers need more information.'' Our Nation's young people are increasingly affected by violence, both as to its perpetrators and its victims. Many violence prevention programs aim to reverse this trend but few of them have been properly evaluated and even fewer have been shown to work. We need to learn what causes young people to become violent. Such information could provide the tools for legislators to make better policy decisions and aid parents, teachers and counselors in providing better care for these young people. Just this month, there's been two school shootings that we're all aware of in California, which has reminded us of the many dangers of ignoring children's needs. The alarming sequence of school shootings from Jonesboro, Arkansas, to Paducah, Kentucky, to Littleton, Colorado and scores of others cry out for a response. We find ourselves searching for answers that do not come easily, and we have to research the solutions, analyze them for our families, our community schools and interaction between the peers. To do that most effectively, they've got to have an understanding of the factors that lead to these tragedies, information social workers are compiling right now. But today's resources are limited. Policy makers lack the information that is needed, information that the social workers have. And the national center will provide this critical link. I can think of no one better qualified or in a better situation to evaluate this great need than the social workers who work with these children on a daily basis. It makes sense to put them to work on these public policy decisions. Social workers are problem solvers. They work to solve problems dealing with people's counseling needs, health care needs, treatment of mental and emotional disorders. So they are uniquely qualified to do research into this particular area. As the Subcommittee considers the fiscal year 2002 Labor and Education Appropriations Act, I respectfully request and encourage you to consider funding for a national center for social work research, ideally to be funded at our authorization level that's requested, but whatever that you believe fits within your budget, the highest level possible, I think it would be well deserving. Let me conclude with this. I'm a conservative, and sometimes conservatives don't jump into the social work arena. But whenever you look at the President's initiative on using faith based organizations, when you look at the arena of child abuse, when you look at juvenile violent crime, whenever you look at our investment in cancer research and things that are causing people to die, is it not incumbent upon us as conservatives to say, we ought to invest in research in the very societal problems that lead us this direction, and that give us this heartache in society. So I don't think we should neglect this area of community, of family, of what we can do as policy makers. And this would coordinate it, rather than just being out there all over the globe, we need to put it in a focused fashion in the National Institutes of Health, tell them to elevate this to a higher priority, because we need some help in solving these problems. [The information follows:] [GRAPHIC(S) NOT AVAILABLE IN TIFF FORMAT] Mr. Regula. And your bill does that, I assume? Mr. Hutchinson. That's exactly what the bill does. Mr. Regula. Questions? Mr. Cunningham. Mr. Cunningham. Asa, my wife drug me to an event this weekend. Remember Peter Yarrow? Peter Yarrow is a good friend of David Obey as well, Peter, Paul and Mary. Maybe you remember that name. Mr. Hutchinson. That I remember. [Laughter.] Mr. Cunningham. He was, I thought, well, this guy is a left wing anti-military guy and I didn't want to go. But I'll tell you what, he's got a program called Don't Laugh at Me for children, and it is fantastic. I think he's a fantastic individual. I've got the tape and the things, I'll let you look to it. It may be something that we can get a copy for you. But it talks about the very things you're doing. I was 100 percent sold, once I saw the program. Mr. Hutchinson. Good. And you're a wise man to go where your wife leads you. [Laughter.] Mr. Regula. Thank you. As I assume, you want to pull information that's being developed in many disparate sources into once center, so there's a focus of it, which then would be able to communicate this out to the public? Mr. Hutchinson. Absolutely. To coordinate what is going on out there, to beef it up, to analyze it a little bit more,to get the information to the people who are making the decisions, to give us more hard data as the Rand study indicated. Again, cancer research would be a good example of that, women's health issues, you know, once you coordinate it, it gets more focused and directed. We need to do this in the social work arena. Mr. Regula. Have you presented your bill to the authorizers yet? Mr. Hutchinson. Oh, absolutely. And Congressman Fred Upton is, I believe, going to put a package together or children's health bill, or a public health bill. Mr. Regula. This is the Education and Work Force Committee, then? Mr. Hutchinson. Correct. So this would be a component, I believe, of what they will do---- Mr. Regula. Oh, part of the Commerce Committee, Energy and Commerce. Mr. Hutchinson. Yes. But we have worked with them and I'm very hopeful that this will move forward. Mr. Regula. Okay, well, thanks for coming this morning. Mr. Hutchinson. Thank you. ---------- Tuesday, March 27, 2001. VARIOUS PROGRAMS AND PROJECTS WITNESS HON. JOE BACA, A REPRESENTATIVE IN CONGRESS FROM THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA Mr. Regula. Mr. Baca, various programs and projects, from California. Welcome. Mr. Baca. Thank you very much, Mr. Chairman, for granting me an opportunity to discuss the importance of education and social issues and needs of the 42nd Congressional district. As you are aware, and my colleagues, I am deeply honored to testify before you. I believe that this Subcommittee handles some of the most important issues facing our Nation, and especially my district. I have submitted a more detailed written statement of my actual requests. Mr. Regula. It will be made a part of the record, obviously. Mr. Baca. Thank you. Education is a top priority for my district, for myself, and has been since I served in the legislature in California and continues to be here. I share with you in my belief that every student should have an opportunity that he or she should be whatever they want to be. As the President indicated, that no child should be left behind, that means having good quality education, encouraging students to stay in school, to go to college, to graduate from school. Many of the appropriations requests I am submitting for reading instruction, mentoring, teaching training, are designed to address these goals, including student retention, crucial issues in my district. Health issues is one important priority in my district. I've submitted to the Subcommittee venues in Congress seeking for funding for drug and alcohol treatment for youth age 12 to 17. Sometimes we forget that a lot of our youth in that area are not receiving the funding especially as it pertains to drugs and alcohol. It's important we put our top priority into supporting individuals. I've supported this legislation in the State legislature. I hope that we can support that kind of legislation to really address teenage drinking and alcohol, especially as it pertains to a lot of us and the effects it has in our schools, especially what's going on, too, as we look at what's going on. Expanding the Healthy Family programs in California to include indigent adults, supporting health care for seniors and children, fighting against breast cancer, license plate funding program, supporting prostate cancer, diabetes research and treatments are also important priorities, which require Federal funds which I am requesting this year. Specifically, I am also requesting funding for San Bernardino Community College district, in my district, we're multi-campus, providing KVCR television station owned by the district for $21 million for digital conversion and expansion of operations, studio space, for $35 million to $42 million for moving the KVCR facility to a more desirable location. Last year you granted me $1.7 million to obtain for distant learning. This is very important, especially as we see community colleges right now. Most of our students are going to community colleges, they can't into four year institutions. And KVCR, through its digital program, is doing a lot more of the outreach and providing educational services. We need to make sure they continue to provide an opportunity, especially as we look at students right now that are trying to get into our four year institutions and can't get in to our State colleges and universities. This is an avenue that can be done through KVCR telecommunications in providing not only classes that they can take and outreach, but also assuring that we provide the facilities. I think this is very important for our area as well. I'm also requesting $500,000 for Fontana Unified School District for subsequently retrofitting an ADA improvement to the civic auditorium, a facility that is utilized by hundreds and thousands of students in the City of Fontana, purchased a building in 1985, this is high priority funding and retrofitting which I think is very important for us. While also the capacity to the city, it has capacity only of 1,000 but we need to continue to improve and provide subsequent retrofitting for that area. I'm also requesting $3 million for the City of Ranch Cucamonga, which I share along with Dreier and Miller that were surrounded in that area to design and construct a new senior citizen center that provides 25 to 30 square feet. The city is providing matching funds of $2 million for land and ongoing maintenance and operation cost. For the City of San Bernardino, I'm requesting $1.5 million for the city to support job training for the city on one stop career center. This request is strongly supported by the civic and business groups in my district, along with Congressman Lewis. Mr. Chair, I have many other projects that I've outlined specifically, the California University at San Bernardino, San Bernardino County Superintendent of Instruction Schools, San Bernardino County Unified School District, the University of California at Riverside, with an incubator that's important to our area, as we look at providing jobs and getting universities. It's the only university in that area that is supported not only by myself, Ken Calvert, Mary Bono, Miller and also Congressman Lewis support the project for funding in that area, even though it's not in my district, but it's the only university within that area, and I think it's our responsibility to provide assistance to them. These are but a few of the many projects that I have submitted requests for you. You have specific details on the others, Mr. Chairman. I thank you for giving me the opportunity to come before you. I know it is a long list and a wish list of many areas. But I believe it's important that I represent my district, submit those requests and whatever possible can be funded, I would appreciate very much if the Committee would be able to look at some of the important projects to improve the quality of life, education and health in our area. [The information follows:] [GRAPHIC(S) NOT AVAILABLE IN TIFF FORMAT] Mr. Regula. Questions? Thank you for coming. You do have a substantial list. Mr. Baca. Thank you, Mr. Chair. I look forward to your continued support, and I'm not shy. [Laughter.] ---------- Tuesday, March 27, 2001. CLOSE UP FOUNDATION AND PROJECTS WITNESS HON. DONALD M. PAYNE, A REPRESENTATIVE IN CONGRESS FROM THE STATE OF NEW JERSEY Mr. Regula. Mr. Payne, New Jersey. I'm sorry, Don, I got you out of order here. Mr. Payne. Well, I may not get an extra program, then. [Laughter.] Mr. Regula. Pretty high price you're asking. Mr. Payne. Thank you. It's certainly a pleasure to be here, Chairman Regula. Let me just start by saying that our city of Newark, New Jersey is really on the rebound, it's coming back. We had a civil disorder in 1967 that really is the dividing point as we look at history in Newark. And because of support that we've gotten from your Committee, we've been going in the right direction over the last decade. Mr. Regula. Are you getting a new airport there, or a lot of pretty major---- Mr. Payne. Yes, pretty major, the road construction funding has just made it, actually, it's the third largest airport now, it's overtaken Kennedy and JFK, I mean, JFK and the other New York air, LaGuardia. Mr. Regula. Is it a hub at this point for any of the airlines? Mr. Payne. Yes, Continental, which has gained a lot of strength and health now, and is doing an excellent job to overseas, South America. Mr. Regula. We left out of there for the---- Mr. Payne. That's right, it's a great place. So anyone who's traveling, at least come through Newark. We have a little city tax on it, you know. But it's great to be here. I'll be brief. We have some health projects, the Emergency Medical Services demonstration project, the Children's Health Care Services and Outreach Center, and Babyland Family Services. What the coordinated Emergency Medical Services demonstration project is, it's a project to bring together transportation and emergency services in older cities. This is a very vital need. So we have, we're asking for $5 million to help with this demonstration project. Of course, the details are in the packets. The second one is the Newark Children's Health Care Service and Outreach Center. It's to positively impact on the health of Newark's children through the development of a coordinated health care system that will allow the city to bring health care services to the community. Through the centralization of services, we believe that we can increase access to an array of health and social service needs to Newark's citizens. We ask for $2.5 million for that. And thirdly, the Babyland Family Services is a major non- profit child and family service organization, providing comprehensive child care and family development services to 1,500 at-risk children and their families annually. Babyland is seeking additional funding to establish the technological linkages to nurture the educational development of almost 700 children, provide computer training for 2000 parents, teachers and entry level professionals. We're asking $2 million there. Just quickly, at the UMDMJ, we have a series of programs that we're asking. One is elimination of health disparity, and they have a very well focused program. We're asking for $5 million over a five year period. There is also a cancer institute center, the Dean and Betty Gallow Prostate Cancer Center. Dean Gallow is a former member of this Subcommittee, unfortunately passed away from prostate cancer. His widow, Betty Gallow, has been carrying the work on that Dean started. So we're asking for $10 million to assist in that project, which has become extremely successful. I'll conclude there, but there is one national program that I am making a request for, Mr. Chairman, it's the Close Up Foundation, civic education fellowship program. As you know, the Close Up Foundation is a civic educational program that brings students from around the country to our Nation's capital to study about government. It's been around for quite a while. As you know, we need all the help we can get in civic education and responsibility. We see what's happening at our high schools and elementary schools in our country. As a former teacher and coach, I didn't coach in the Army, but I coached in high school, we really see the need for these kinds of programs, bringing youngsters to our Nation's capital, stressing civic education, which I think is missing in a lot of our school systems. So with that, we'll submit our full text and I appreciate, like I said before, the previous support and look for continued support. [The information follows:] [GRAPHIC(S) NOT AVAILABLE IN TIFF FORMAT] Mr. Regula. Thank you. Questions? Mr. Cunningham. Don, the Close Up Program, that's not the one that recently had controversy with Reverend Jackson, is it? Mr. Payne. No, not to my knowledge, no. It's really a program that has a lot of support from business, but we do need to have our Federal support. But to my knowledge, this is not that program. Mr. Cunningham. Okay, thank you, Don. Mr. Payne. Thank you very much. Mr. Regula. Thank you for coming. ---------- Tuesday, March 27, 2001. PROJECTS WITNESS HON. ROBERT SCOTT, A REPRESENTATIVE IN CONGRESS FROM THE COMMONWEALTH OF VIRGINIA Mr. Regula. Mr. Scott, from the great State of Virginia. Mr. Scott. Thank you, Mr. Chairman and members of the Committee. I appreciate the opportunity to speak with you today. To save time, Mr. Chairman, you have the testimony and I want to just speak very briefly on two projects, the Massey Cancer Center at the Medical College of Virginia, and the Achievable Dream Program in Newport News, Virginia. The Massey Cancer Center, Mr. Chairman, is a building, a $26 million project. We're requesting $2.8 million from appropriations. The board of directors will be raising $10 million to $15 million. Mr. Regula. Is this a private non-profit? Mr. Scott. I'm sorry? Mr. Regula. Is it a private, non-profit school? Mr. Scott. The Medical College of Virginia is a State college. It's part of the Virginia Commonwealth University. Mr. Regula. Right. Mr. Scott. It's a $26 million program. The board of directors will be raising $10 million to $15 million, and we have received previous requests of $1.2 million, and we hope to receive the remaining $2.8 million to complete the project. The center is one of 59 national cancer institute programs, and it's an excellent program, Mr. Chairman, and I would hope that staff will read the details on it, and it's one that we're very much interested in. They have an outreach program going into the rural areas where they've had a significant impact on incidence of cancer and success in treating cancer from the Medical College of Virginia, going out into rural areas. The Achievable Dream Program is an education program consisting of teaching at-risk students at an elementary and middle school. Basically they have as kind of a hook, you come in and play tennis in the afternoon during the summer, education in the morning, then they go into the full year-round session. It's basically an inner city school. They have extra curricular and character building activities. They have shown that the program works. Their test scores are at or above the city average, and we have some areas where there are very high income students, very low income students. These low income students are at or above, in some cases way above, the city average. They receive significant support from the community, an average of about $1,800 per student. We're asking for $1.5 million from funds for the improvement of education so that we can start an early childhood center for three to four year olds. The earlier you start, the much better you can do. This is a very successful program, and we hope we can have your continued support. [The information follows:] [GRAPHIC(S) NOT AVAILABLE IN TIFF FORMAT] Mr. Regula. Questions? Mr. Cunningham. Mr. Cunningham. Bobby, we have a teaching hospital in San Diego for medicine, and it's just about to fold. With the HMOs, California is a leader in HMOs, yes, we do need HMO reform. But are you having those similar problems with the teaching hospitals and the training of doctors? A, the number that are requesting medical school has gone down, secondly, that they're having trouble funding it. Mr. Scott. A significant portion of the patient load is Medicaid, Medicare. So the reduced reimbursements are squeezing all of the hospitals, particularly the teaching hospitals, because they're open to everybody. So anybody that comes in, they're going to deal with. It's a major strain. Mr. Cunningham. I think across the Nation we're having trouble, and we're going to have trouble having good doctors, I think, in the future, unless we attend to it. Thank you. Mr. Scott. Thank you. ---------- Tuesday, March 27, 2001. CLEVELAND BOTANICAL GARDEN (PROJECT) WITNESS HON. STEPHANIE TUBBS-JONES, A REPRESENTATIVE IN CONGRESS FROM THE STATE OF OHIO Mr. Regula. Next, from the great, great State of Ohio, Stephanie Tubbs-Jones. Stephanie, you're going to speak on behalf of the Cleveland Botanical Garden. Ms. Tubbs-Jones. That's correct. If you'll allow me to stray for just a moment, I want to bring you greetings from my predecessor, the Honorable Congressman Louis Stokes. Mr. Regula. He was here in person last week. Ms. Tubbs-Jones. Oh, really? Did he tell you about us naming a post office after his mom, and how great it was? Well, doggone it, I'll have to tell him he preempted me. Mr. Regula. About everything I see in Cleveland has been named after him. We're running out of streets. Ms. Tubbs-Jones. I think so. [Laughter.] I'm just trying to hold my name out there. I can't get the streets and the buildings, but I'm doing okay. Mr. Chairman, thank you very, very much for the opportunity to present this morning. I'm here on behalf of the Cleveland Botanical Gardens. This is our fiscal year 2002 request, to secure $1 million in Federal funds to enable the Cleveland Botanical Garden to develop interactive ecological exhibits and educational materials for students from kindergarten through 12th grade and their families. You have all this information in your packet. I thinklast year when I presented, you had the opportunity to taste right from downtown salsa, which is a salsa that is produced by the students who grow tomatoes at this facility and surrounding facilities. What the botanical gardens has attempted to do is let young people in Cleveland's school districts and surrounding school districts have an understanding of ecology, an understanding of preserving the environment. So in this next step, we've already begun the funding of a glass house, but what the next step will allow us to build, two ecological systems, one like that exists in Costa Rica, where you have high ground properties, where people will be able to come through and interact with the activities, similar to probably some of the rainforest and other areas. But the other areas have focused on the lowlands, and we're going to focus in on the highlands. I could be very detailed in my presentation, but I know you don't want me to be, so I will not. But I come here to say that this is a project that's very important to my Congressional district, but also important to the region and the area and the State of Ohio. I appreciate all the support that you gave me last year, and in my second term as now a sophomore member of Congress, no longer a freshwoman, I'm here to say I need your help again, and any additional information that I can supply you, I'll be glad to do so, and I thank you for the opportunity to be heard. [The information follows:] [GRAPHIC(S) NOT AVAILABLE IN TIFF FORMAT] Mr. Regula. I think I got a note that they're doing long distance learning from there. Ms. Tubbs-Jones. That's correct. In fact, the director of the program would be here, but he's in Costa Rica, because we're doing exchange programs with children from Ohio and children from Costa Rica. It's a pretty exciting opportunity and a collaboration between Case Western Reserve University, the Botanical Gardens and the University of Costa Rica. Mr. Regula. Questions? You got some support for this last year, I believe. Ms. Tubbs-Jones. Yes, sir, and if I didn't say it, I thought I did, thank you for last year's support, and I'm back again. Anything else you can give me, I'd appreciate it. Mr. Regula. I'm not surprised. [Laughter.] ---------- Tuesday, March 27, 2001. LUPUS RESEARCH AND CAREGIVERS AND PROJECTS WITNESS HON. CARRIE P. MEEK, A REPRESENTATIVE IN CONGRESS FROM THE STATE OF FLORIDA Mr. Regula. Our next guest is Carrie Meek from Florida. Carrie, we're glad to have you, an also a member of our Full Committee. Mrs. Meek. Thank you, Chairman Regula, and all my friends on this Committee. I'm pleased to be here today. It's regarding a program in which I'm very, very interested and very concerned. I want to testify this morning on my highest funding priorities for fiscal year 2002. I understand you have a very awesome responsibility and you don't have the resources that you really need to meet some of these responsibilities. But we'll have to do the best we can. There are some issues that I'm interested in, and I know the time is limited, so I want to submit the rest of my testimony for the record. Mr. Regula. Without objection. Mrs. Meek. My number one priority, Mr. Chairman, is increased funding for lupus. Each of you is aware of this disease, we've been before your subcommittee for many years. And thank God, it was authorized last year, through Chairman Bilirakis' committee. It was a very long fight. It is something that I come before this Subcommittee to ask you, now that it's authorized, will you please fund it to the point that we can stop the killing and the maiming of this disease of young women? I'd like to request $30 million for the Centers for Disease Control to fund a grant program authorized under Title V, Subtitle B of Public Law 106-505. It's the Public Health Improvement Act of 2000, for treatment and support services for lupus patients and their families. This is a little bit different from the rest of the things you've been doing for us. Through the years, you have each year provided some funding for lupus. Now we're asking you to provide funding to support the lupus patients, in that they have a very, very hard time with their physical bodies being naturally undermined by this disease. I also request $25 million in additional research funding over and above the enacted 2001 level on the Title V, to enable the National Institutes of Arthritis, Musculoskeletal, and Skin Diseases, you call it NIAMS, to conduct expanded research to understand the causes and to find a cure for lupus. First of all, there is no cure for lupus. The treatment for lupus many times is just as harmful to the patient as is the lupus itself. The third thing is, if you continue the research, sooner or later you will get to the cause and a cure for this disease. Now, it's very important to me that we find a cure for lupus, and find a cure for the suffering that people go through. My sister died of lupus, a lot of young women die of lupus in their child bearing years. I've been urging the Congress to direct NIAMS and NIH to mount an all-out campaign against lupus. Now, rest assured that this is not to say that they have not been working hard on this. Except that they need more resources to do the support service, they need more researchers, more resources to do the research as well. Now, this is a killer. It's an autoimmune disease and it kills more people than HIV-AIDS and most of the other autoimmune diseases. It's really significant for women to focus on this disease, because about 1.4 million Americans have some form of lupus, and most of them are women. Many of these victims, if you've ever seen anyone or talked to anyone with lupus, the pain is very debilitating. The women aren't even able to hold their own children. Suffice it to say, Mr. Chairman and members of the Committee, I'm asking for $30 million for the Centers for Disease Control to fund a grant program which will support lupus patients. I'm requesting $25 million in additional research funding. That's going to NIAMS, which is a part of the National Institutes of Health. These groups have done an outstanding job, and if anyone can beat this diseases, it's those two. The most discouraging thing is that the family members suffer so from this particular disease. My second priority, Mr. Chairman, is a demonstration project to develop and test HIV-AIDS prevention, a media campaign. We brought it before the Committee last year, they thought it was a good idea, but they didn't fund it. What we'd like to do is a demonstration project to develop and test on HIV-AIDS. We know that the media program has worked with cigarettes. It has worked with HIV. But I'm requesting this now, and you know the drug program has worked. Every time you see one of those very well thought out drug programs regarding children, you will see that it's very, very effective. I'm requesting $10 million for the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention to develop and implement a grass roots minority HIV-AIDS prevention media campaign. That would be modeled after the $185 million the Congress spent on anti-drug media programs for the National Office of Drug Control. Funding for it would be used to develop and test the effectiveness of the HIV-AIDS prevention media campaign in 20 United States counties with the greatest number of minority HIV infections. I won't prolong that. Each of you is aware of the propensity of HIV-AIDS to kill and to maim the population. Third, Mr. Chairman and members, $15 million to fund the Higher Education Demonstration Projects, which will ensure equal opportunities for individuals with learning disabilities. Now, you all have heard of learning disabilities in youngsters from K-12. And a lot is done for them. Very little is done for youngsters who get out of high school and go to college and have learning disabilities. And to say that means that they need support as well as the younger persons do. It's one that shows you that you'd be surprised that a number of youngsters who go to college with learning disabilities, they don't read very well, most of them are very bright students. But they have these learning disabilities, and the teachers are not really capable of being able to understand how to teach these young people, nor do they understand what these learning disabilities are. So I'm urging the Committee to include $15 million to fund the grant program currently authorized. We were able to get this program authorized about two years ago here in the Congress through the Labor HHS Committee, and we were able to get it funded at $5 million for the entire country. But think of all the students who are enrolled in institutions of higher education who need these services and cannot get them. So as I understand it, each year a million dollars has been placed in that program to take care of some of the needs. I'm sure you realize that $1 million more each year certainly would not put that program where it should be. What this does, it identifies college students with learning disabilities and develops effective techniques for teaching these students. I think it's very fair that we think of the fact that we are really developing our students, and just because they have a learning disability doesn't mean that they're not bright. I think if you note, Einstein was learning disabled. That just gives you one example of the kind of student you're dealing with with learning disabilities. They're very bright students. University professors have found the research that has developed as a result of this program has been very helpful, helping them to teach students in higher education. My next one, Mr. Chairman, I listed them all for the Committee to look at, increased funding for community health centers. I support an increase in funding for the consolidated health centers program by at least $175 million for fiscal year 2002 in order to provide an inexpensive way to get high quality, affordable primary health care to under-served communities. Now, just take my State of Florida. There are 2.5 million people who have no regular source of primary care. Most of these people are in urban inner city areas like my home community in Miami, and in isolated rural areas. They do need better health care. And of course, the community health care centers is one that can provide that kind of help to people. The last one has to do with please increase funding for graduate medical education for pediatric hospitals to $285 million, the fully authorized level. You say, well, Carrie, that's really asking for a lot. You made a good start in your funding for pediatric graduate medical education the last time. But this is one of the areas of health care which has been overlooked for a very long time. We should take the next step by moving as quickly as possible toward funding at the fully authorized level. And I want to thank the Chairman and the members of the Committee for your patience in listening to the list of things I've brought before you. I'm sure that you will look at them in such a way as will meet the needs of the people of this country. I think of all the things we deal with here in the Congress, health is one of our most important ones, and I thank the Committee for having me appear before you. [The information follows:] [GRAPHIC(S) NOT AVAILABLE IN TIFF FORMAT] Mr. Regula. Thank you. Questions? Thank you, Carrie. Did you get that building down there that we had a couple of years ago and name it after the President, the college? Mrs. Meek. No, you wanted to name it after me, that's why they didn't build it, I think. Mr. Regula. Did they build it? Mrs. Meek. Yes, they did. Mr. Regula. They didn't name it after you, though? Mrs. Meek. No, they did not. Mr. Regula. Well, we'll have to---- Mrs. Meek. We'll have to take the money back, Mr. Regula. [Laughter.] Mr. Regula. Has it been named yet? Mrs. Meek. No, not yet. Mr. Regula. Maybe we can address that problem. Mrs. Meek. All right, thank you so much. ---------- Tuesday, March 27, 2001. MEDICARE AND HEALTH CARE FINANCING ADMINISTRATION WITNESS HON. PETE STARK, A REPRESENTATIVE IN CONGRESS FROM THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA Mr. Regula. Mr. Stark from California. Mr. Stark. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. Do you have any leftover buildings in the 13th Congressional District in Northern California? Maybe Duke and I could work something out. Mr. Regula. No money. Mr. Stark. No money, okay. [Laughter.] Well, if I were just to build the sign that goes over the door, could I contribute that? Thank you for giving me the opportunity to address you this morning, Mr. Chairman, members. I hope you'll take my complete statement for the record, and just let me summarize it for you. As the Chair recalls, for 10 years, I guess, I chaired the health subcommittee of the Ways and Means Committee. It has since been chaired both by Mr. Chairman Thomas and now Mrs. Johnson. I believe we are all in accord on this, and we have all had our disagreements with HCFA. Under the 10 years that I chaired the Committee HCFA was under Republican, under a Republican Administration, it's been under a Democratic Administration when Mr. Thomas was there. The reports have been late, we've had complaints from doctors and hospitals, you've all had complaints in your Congressional districts. But the truth is, in all of that time, we have been able to say, as we speak to people across the country, that they're operating the Medicare operation a couple of hundred billion dollars a year with a 2 percent overhead. There's not an insurance company in the world, Blue Cross and Kaiser maybe come to 12 percent, that could operate on 2 percent. And some of the more expensive insurance companies that are doing the same thing, 14, 18 percent. And it's these same insurance companies, Blue Cross, that do a preponderance of the work under the supervision of HCFA for distributing these payments. Think about this. Today, Medicare beneficiaries will make a million physician visits. This is not just hospitals. This is going to the doctor. A million visits. And Medicare will process more than 3 million claims today and spend a billion bucks. That's what we're doing every day. And we're doing this on their share of the budget, about $2.2 billion for program management. The graph will show, Mr. Chairman, that this is in real dollars, the dotted line down here, and it's only in the past year that we've gotten up to 1993 expenditures. Now, what's wrong? Their computer system doesn't work. They haven't gotten up to the full time employee level that they were 10 years ago. We have been starving them. And since 1996, we gave 700 new legislative provisions for them to administer. Now, you can say we're cockeyed for doing that. My point is that we all do that. This is a Congressional mandate, and it's been under both parties and under both Administrations. The money, although you get scored for it, comes out of the trust fund. So those of us who want to protect the trust fund realize, but let me just tell you this. That it was in 1996 that we came out with this, or we didn't come out, we got this 14 percent of what we were spending. Again, let's say it's $2 billion a year. Twenty-eight billion of that was spent incorrectly. Now, some of the incorrect payments were fraud and abuse, and some were just mistakes, just filled out the form wrong, paid the check wrong, whatever we did. We were throwing away, if you will, in the 20s of billions of year. They have cut that, because of legislative provisions we mandated, to 6.8 percent. They have cut that in half. So they have saved $12 billion in six years by addressing the fraud provisions which we forced on them. Now, what I'm telling you, they're doing this, and they're still only spending $2 billion a year for administration, and the results of what they're doing have saved us $12 billion. So I'm just here saying, could we double their budget over a period of years and get them up to say, 4 percent of benefit spending. I don't know how much a new computer system is going to cost. It's in the dark ages. But you and I know that the phone company can find everybody, and our credit card people, Visa and Master Charge are more efficient than HCFA, and they're spending more to collect money from us. So that's my plea. I'll be glad to try and answer any questions. This is one of our better managed bureaucracies. [The information follows:] [GRAPHIC(S) NOT AVAILABLE IN TIFF FORMAT] Mr. Regula. Has mechanization helped, the computers and record keeping? Mr. Stark. Of course. And they're behind the curve. There's no question that mistakes were made, I'm trying to think of how many years ago it was, Mr. Chairman, they decided to do eight different computer programs around the country, because they felt they had to give eight different people a chance to bid on the work. How do you have eight different systems? Mr. Regula. Do they still have more than one system? Mr. Stark. They have more than one. Because historically, when Medicare came into being, it was, the billing part of it was turned over mostly to Blue Cross people around the country. So every are has a different billing system. Because they have a different person, we actually contract out the majority of the work to people called intermediaries. We've got to change that. This is the 21st century. Mr. Regula. Are you saying change the contracting out, or changing the coordination? Mr. Stark. Changing the coordination, changing the method. There's a whole lot of modernization. But they've got to have the equipment and the personnel to do it. And I have great faith in Governor Thompson, a good administrator in my natal State of Wisconsin. But we've had good administrators right along. It's one of the biggest bureaucracies, as you know. Mr. Regula. It's a Herculean task. Mr. Stark. It is. And we can't starve them at the same time we're forcing more work down on them. As I say, I don't think we can find either a budgetary fight or a partisan fight on this issue. I know we don't get scored for the savings out of the fraud and abuse as opposed to directly. But it's there, and as I say, these are---- Mr. Regula. Do the intermediaries pick up fraud? Mr. Stark. They will trigger investigations, because they're the ones who can understand patterns. But each intermediary, the problem is, has a different way of judging. In other words, certain screening tests, that would call for surgery or certain screening tests that would call for more clinical tests could differ. One area of the country might pay for bone marrow and another might not. Don't ask me why. This is just the historical way they have done this. So there's a lot we can accomplish. But for us to begin to proceed more rapidly, which we should do, is going to take people and--the sheer volume, the complexity of all the different medical procedures. And one of these days, we're probably going to get into pharmaceuticals, and that's just going to add another whole bunch of words and numbers and procedures that you and I wouldn't be able to spell or understand, but we would end up paying for. Mr. Regula. That's an enormous challenge. Mr. Stark. Yes. If you could find, as you push these numbers around, some there, I think that you will find the Republican Administration, the Democratic minority will move to help in any way we can. Mr. Regula. Pretty much a bipartisan issue. Mr. Stark. I believe so, Mr. Chairman. I certainly don't-- all I can tell you is that in the past years, the current chair and the now chair of the full Committee have supported efforts to see that HCFA gets better funding. Mr. Regula. Mr. Sherwood. Mr. Sherwood. I talked with Governor Thompson about this problem the other night. It's very real and we have to address it. We find that all over the Government, that our computer systems are not anywhere near up to date with the work we're trying to accomplish. And it costs us money in unusual ways, because of that. Mr. Stark. If the gentleman would yield, and this is the poster child of the type of operation that can save from computerization, because of the huge volume of small claims and forms that have to be filled out. As I say, we're all excited that Governor Thompson can do a good job over there, but I think we've got to give him the resources. Mr. Sherwood. I agree. Mr. Stark. I thank the gentleman for his concern. Mr. Regula. Thank you. Mr. Stark. I thank you for the opportunity to present the case here today, and I hope you can find a few dollars to help out this group. Thank you very much, Mr. Chairman. Mr. Regula. Thank you. ---------- Tuesday, March 27, 2001. CONGREGATE AND HOME-DELIVERED-MEALS PROGRAM WITNESS HON. CHRISTOPHER SHAYS, A REPRESENTATIVE IN CONGRESS FROM THE STATE OF CONNECTICUT Mr. Regula. Mr. Boehner. Mr. Boehner. I'll yield to my colleague who's in the middle of a hearing. Mr. Regula. Oh, all right, Mr. Shays, congregate and home delivered meals program. Mr. Shays. Thank you. He yielded on the agreement I'd be 30 seconds. I thank him very much. Mr. Chairman, just to make you aware of the fact that our congregate meal and our home delivered meals has been somewhat static, and there hasn't been a sense of-- Mr. Regula. Static in reimbursement, static in numbers? Mr. Shays. Funding, except in terms of adding a little bit to the congregate last year. But the bottom line is, I'm asking if you would restore $43 million to put $43 million into the congregate meal program to bring it to a total of $421 million, which would bring it to the funding level of 1995. The only point I want to make to you is that there have been unused funds in the congregate meal that have been unused by agencies, and they have built up a level of spending now so those unused funds from past years have been used up, and you're going to start to see around the country some significant deficits. Just an alert to you that you may need to take a look at it. [The information follows:] [GRAPHIC(S) NOT AVAILABLE IN TIFF FORMAT] Mr. Regula. Don't we get a lot of volunteers involved in this operation? Mr. Shays. Yes, it's great. You get a lot of volunteers, but this pays for the meals. You get a lot of volunteers who come to the congregate sites, a lot of volunteers who do the home delivered meals. It's a cost effective program. Mr. Regula. Do they get reimbursed mileage, because they drive their automobiles? Mr. Shays. I'm not even sure of that, sir. We just had a challenge in our district because what we found is they had built up to levels using past funds. They built up their spending level above the annual appropriations that exist. So the States made up the difference in Connecticut. But I suspect you may be having a problem around the country that will start to surface as people use past funds for present operations. Mr. Regula. Well, and of course, more seniors, too. Mr. Sherwood? Mr. Sherwood. No questions. Mr. Regula. Well, thanks. Mr. Shays. Thank you, and I thank my colleague for yielding. ---------- Tuesday, March 27, 2001. VARIOUS PROGRAMS WITNESS HON. JOHN A. BOEHNER, A REPRESENTATIVE IN CONGRESS FROM THE STATE OF OHIO Mr. Regula. Mr. Boehner. Mr. Boehner. Hello, Mr. Chairman. I'm glad to be here this morning. Mr. Regula. What will you be doing to our budget over there in your committee? Mr. Boehner. We'll be working very closely with you. Good morning and thanks for the opportunity to be here. Let me say hello to my friend and the newest member of your Committee, Mr. Sherwood. It's nice to see that you're here. And I appreciate the job that you all have in terms of trying to decide how to allocate the biggest chunk of the Appropriations Committee. It is a difficult choice. I'm here today as chairman of the Education and Work Force Committee to really outline our priorities. I think the President has done a good job in his proposal on education, which is embodied in a bill that we introduced last week, H.R. 1. And the effort there is to close the achievement gap that exists between disadvantaged students and their peers, and to work with States to improve the schools to be the best in the world. I could talk about the President's education proposal, but you all understand it fairly clearly. More flexibility in terms of consolidating programs, in allowing schools to have more flexibility over how to use those resources in their schools. Secondly, actually doing a better job of targeting the money to the schools who need it the most. And thirdly, putting into place a new reading program that is absolutely essential. Because if children can't read, they're not going to learn. We know that the early childhood reading program, and the President's proposal, will do a lot to improve reading scores, and we think, learning. Now, money is not the only issue here. We've spent $130 billion since 1965 on well intentioned, well meaning education programs. The fact is, we've gotten almost no results for the money we've invested. And what we need is a system of accountability and rededication of the Federal Government's commitment to helping those students who would otherwise fall through the cracks. Let me point out three issues that I think are most important on the education side. They're outlined in the authorization levels in our bill, H.R. 1, which is in effect the President's proposal. A $461 million increase in Title I, $320 million for the President's State assessment initiative for grades 3 through 8 in reading and math and thirdly, $975 million for the President's reading first and early reading program. When you look at what we're attempting to do over there in terms of providing for more accountability and more flexibility, we believe that, and targeting, targeting the money to these children who most need it, these three programs that we've outlined here are the core of making this work. I'd also ask that you find the resources to increase funding for IDEA. This Committee has done a marvelous job the last five years in increasing IDEA funding. The President's calling for increased funds, and I know that every member of Congress listens to what I listen to when I go home from every one of my school districts. And that's that IDEA needs more money. You should be aware that part of the President's request for his reading program and the early childhood reading program will in effect help with IDEA issues in local districts. That's because there are an awful lot of students that end up in IDEA because they can't read. To the extent we can solve this reading problem or address this reading problem, both the early childhood reading and the K-3 reading program, I think we'll take a big step in helping these school districts with their IDEA money issues. Secondly, in this area, the President has also asked for a billion dollar increase in Pell Grants. We all understand the need to continue the effort to increase the Pell Grants, to help those children, again, at the bottom of the economic ladder, who without that effort would never be able to attend post secondary education programs. And I think that again, you're getting a lot of requests, but I think we all understand the importance of the Pell Grant program. Let me switch gears and talk about the other side of my committee, and that would be the labor side. I support the President's plan to level fund the Department of Labor, especially in our enforcement areas. In the past, the DOL has had the habit of administering the Nation's labor and employment laws beyond what I believe the scope of what Congress intended. And I think taxpayers savings will arise from effectively protecting workers by properly enforcing important labor and employment laws. I would ask that you support the efforts of the Department of Labor's inspector general to better protect workers benefit funds and reduce waste, fraud and abuse that continues to exist there. So I thank you for the opportunity to be here and look forward to answering any questions that you might have. [The information follows:] [GRAPHIC(S) NOT AVAILABLE IN TIFF FORMAT] Mr. Regula. One of the components of the President's program is testing. Mr. Boehner. Correct. Mr. Regula. Do you anticipate that the Federal Government will fund these tests, even though the States develop them? Mr. Boehner. What the President proposed is that we, the Federal Government, assist the States in developing their tests. Under his proposal and under H.R. 1, the States will determine what tests to use in their States. Mr. Regula. I understand that. Mr. Boehner. But the actual implementation of it is left to the States. Now, this bill is going through committee here in the next month or month and a half. Whether we get into funds for the actual implementation of the test is yet to unclear. But Mr. Chairman, I think you understand that in virtually every school district in America, there's testing that goes on every year. Mr. Regula. Oh, yes. Mr. Boehner. And under the President's proposal, some States are already testing in every grade, reading and math. Others may be doing other tests. But frankly, I'm not so sure that when it's all said and done there's any additional testing that's going to result from the President's proposal. I believe that the requirement that we'll have in our bill, that we have annual assessments in reading and math in grades three through eight may in fact replace some other testing that's already being done. Mr. Regula. Staff just advised me, apparently the budget resolution withholds a $1.25 billion from this Committee, unless we appropriate a commensurate increase for special ed. Well, obviously that's going to squeeze what we have to do some of these other things that are embodied in your bill. Mr. Boehner. Sounds like a big issue between the Appropriations Committee and the Budget Committee. Mr. Regula. I've noticed that there's some discussion of that. You're going to be involved, too, because you're going to bring to us through authorization programs that cost money. Mr. Boehner. I'm confident that when the budget resolution gets through the House and the Senate and we come to conference, that all of these issues will be ironed out to our satisfaction, as they always are. Mr. Regula. That there will be adequate funding. Mr. Boehner. I'm convinced that there will be adequate funding. Even though the President has called for an overall increase in discretionary funding of about 4 percent, it is going to put pressure on all of you to make serious decisions about what needs to be funded. Mr. Regula. True. Very true. Mr. Boehner. But I think it's obvious from all the national polling that we see that education is the number one issue in the country. The President called for it during his campaign. He has devoted serious time to this over the last several months. And as we get the bill through our Committee and the Floor, and the Senate does theirs, I do expect that we will have a bill signed into law prior to your bill, your appropriations bill, being on the Floor. I would expect that Mr. Miller and I, the Ranking Democrat on the Committee, we expect to work closely with you as we move through this process. Mr. Regula. Mr. Sherwood. Mr. Sherwood. Mr. Chairman, I have great faith in your ability to work those things out. Mr. Boehner. So do I. Mr. Sherwood. But the assessment issue I think is so important. Because parents and students deserve to know where they stand in relation to other schools. I think our education establishment has tried to push that on the back burner, because they don't want the comparison and they worry about teaching towards the test and those sorts of things. Well, I think our college board tests and so forth have told us that if the test is well designed, there are tests that work. I like the President's proposal to bring assessment forward, testing forward. Mr. Boehner. Well, Mr. Sherwood, as a former school board member, you understand better than most, well, the Chairman's a former member of the education establishment, I might add, but the annual assessments really are important, because there's a big secret out there. The big secret is that about half of our kids just are not learning. Now, we've lost a generation of students in our country. We can keep looking the other way, and act like it doesn't exist. We can continue to allow the disease of low expectations to continue. But the people that get hurt the most are the people at the low end of the economic ladder in our country, the most disadvantaged of our children are the ones who are trapped and who will never succeed without an education. And although we've done all types of well intentioned programs out of here, the fact is that we need to start asking for results. And one of the issues that, and Mr. Miller and I are in much more agreement than most of you would ever guess about the direction of this bill, because the money needs to get to those students who most need it. Those schools in inner city neighborhoods and rural communities, they've got bigger problems. They need the extra funds in order to ensure that those kids get a decent education. But without the testing, without the bright light of truth being shone on what's happening in some of our buildings, I don't think we'll ever get there. Because there's a certain amount that we can do in terms of the Federal Government. But when you put the bright light on what's happening in these schools, it will energize communities, businesses, parents to get out of their easy chairs, get away from their TV and find out what in the world is happening in our schools. That is just as important as the change in direction that we're going to be proposing the next couple of months. Mr. Sherwood. Expectations are the key. Mr. Regula. Accountability. Mr. Boehner. That's it. We'll have plenty of time to talk about it as the year goes on. Mr. Regula. I think we'll hear from you in the future. Mr. Boehner. Thank you. ---------- Tuesday, March 27, 2001. HEALTH RESEARCH PROGRAMS WITNESS HON. CHRIS SMITH, A REPRESENTATIVE IN CONGRESS FROM THE STATE OF NEW JERSEY Mr. Regula. Mr. Smith, Chris, health research programs. Mr. Smith. Thank you very much. Mr. Chairman and members of the Committee, thank you for this opportunity to appear before the Committee. I would ask that my full statement be made a part of the record, Mr. Chairman. Thank you. Let me just say on last Congress, I formed, along with Congressman Ed Markey a caucus that now comprises 131 members and continues to grow in the area of Alzheimer's research. As all of us know, and many of us have had family members who have suffered the devastating impact of that disease, as we all know, it's not terminal, but it devastates not only the patient but also the family and especially the primary caregiver, who often, it turns out to be, is the spouse, raising serious questions about respite care. But the bottom line is that right now, there are about 4 million people who have Alzheimer's and many more thousands, tens of thousands, who are in the process of developing this devastating disease. It's estimated by the year 2050, 14 million people, today's baby boomers, will have Alzheimer's disease in those who are moving into that age category. So it's a ballooning epidemic, that if we don't marry up the necessary resources in research and trying to get to the cause and hopefully to solve it, to reverse it in those who have it and prevent it in those who do not have it, we're talking about a major---- Mr. Regula. Chris, I'm curious. Is this prevalent in other countries in somewhat the same degree that we have it? Mr. Smith. It's a very good question. Increasingly, it's recognized that Alzheimer's is a disease of aging. So where you have an aging population, and many of our developing countries, people simply don't make it into their 60s or 70s. It's estimated that anyone who's 85 or older, one out of every two, are in some part, one degree or another into Alzheimer's disease. So it is a function, to some extent, of our aging. Mr. Regula. It has parameters of degrees of severity, I assume, from what you are saying. Mr. Smith. Yes, there are. It's a progressive disease that gets progressively worse as the dementia and the plaques and everything else in the brain form. Mr. Regula. Then in turn have impact on the physical well being of the individual, is that correct? Mr. Smith. That's correct. It may not lead to, like we see with some diseases, a breakdown where the kidneys don't function. It doesn't do that. But it leads to an overall deterioration of the patient. They're not as viable. They certainly are not interacting. But primarily, if they exist and get worse and worse and worse, they very often just sit in a chair and do very little. They don't recognize family members. And the impact on the family members, because I've known so many of them, sometimes it's much harder for them, for a husband or wife to go spend time with their family member and they don't even recognize them. So we're asking on behalf of our coalition, of our caucus, for a $200 million increase to really declare war on this. There have been a number of very promising studies that have been done. They're all in one stage or another, and it seems to me that this is something we can lick if we again have enough resources. The second, if I could, because I know we--it's not a vote. The second is in the area of autism. I've been involved in the autism issue since elected to Congress 21 years ago. On and off, I always thought CDC-NIH were doing what they could do, inquiries that I would make over the years, particularly in the 1980s, suggested that yes, we're doing what we can. Three years ago, in one of my major cities, Brick Township, we discovered that there may be a cluster of autistic children. There seemed to be an elevated number, perhaps as much as double what the national average was expected to be, which is one out of every 500 children. We asked CDC to come in, we asked other people from ATSDR to come in and do a study. They did. They found out that indeed there was a four per thousand, a doubling of instances of autistic children in that area. From my contacts since and during that process, I have been astonished as to what we don't know about autism and how we have almost been frozen in time over the last 20 years doing very little to mitigate this disease. We don't know what causes it, we don't even know what the prevalence of this terrible disease is, the reporting that goes on in State after State is passive. Most States don't have a clue. To remedy that, last year I introduced legislation that became Title I in Mike Bilirakis' bill of the Centers of Excellence to get at the prevalence issue, but also to begin looking at what can we do, what triggers autism. We all know families who have had autistic children who are into their second and going into their third year, all of a sudden, bingo, their child can't communicate. And this developmental disorder, for whatever the trigger is, becomes very compulsive and again, they start down a course of expenses and tragedy, even though they love their children desperately, it is a heartbreak like few heartbreaks one can experience. We're asking for a very modest $5 million to try to, in addition to what's already been allocated, to try to, it would be for the Center for Birth Defects and Development Disabilities at CDC. We've scoped it out, we think it's a good idea. We ask you to take a look at it. More needs to be done without a doubt. New Jersey has taken the lead. We don't know why there seems to be an elevated number in New Jersey. If there is one. There may be no cluster. There may be a problem that is going on everywhere else, it's just been below the radar screen. And I would hope that you could take a look at this as well. [The information follows:] [GRAPHIC(S) NOT AVAILABLE IN TIFF FORMAT] Mr. Regula. Mr. Sherwood. Mr. Sherwood. No questions, Mr. Chairman. Mr. Regula. Well, I'm sure, Chris, both of these require attention. I think NIH is working on them, and as you know, there's been a commitment to double their budget over a five year period. And I assume the groups contact them, because they do allocate resources at NIH. We don't try to dictate just where they should do their work. Mr. Smith. I do understand that, and I think they have realized maybe belatedly, because they have such a full plate, just that this has been underfunded in the past and this is a problem overseas as well. In Poland, for example, I've been working with a group that's, they don't know how to deal with it. Some of our people, Johnson and Johnson has been active in this. There seems to be a gross under-reporting of these cases as well over there. I'm sure as we get into the surveillance and the prevalence issue, we're going to find that there's so much more that we don't know. The numbers are higher, and I say that as a tragedy. Just one final point. We have formed a caucus, Mike Doyle and I formed it this year, we have 101 members, and that's growing as well, to deal with the issue of autism. I know you'll be very sympathetic, and I look forward to working with you. Mr. Regula. Thank you for coming. Mr. Smith. Thank you, Mr. Chairman, Mr. Sherwood. Mr. Regula. We'll recess until 2:00 o'clock this afternoon. [Recess.] ---------- Afternoon Session Mr. Regula. Well, Wes, you are number one. ---------- Tuesday, March 27, 2001. PROJECTS WITNESS HON. WES WATKINS, A REPRESENTATIVE IN CONGRESS FROM THE STATE OF OKLAHOMA Mr. Watkins. First, let me say congratulations, Mr. Chairman to you, after many years of serving in the Interior. Well, you are still in the Interior, but you are just not the Chair over there. I appreciate the opportunity, and I appreciate all your work over all the years on the various committees, and especially Interior, and now as Chair of the Subcommittee on Labor and HHS. Mr. Chairman, you know, you have probably heard me over the years talk about our needs in the rural and economically depressed areas of the southeast Oklahoma quadrant. I have 21 counties in my district, and all of them are rural, and also the Tulsa area, which is doing well economically, and the big Oklahoma City metropolitan area. I have got a nick that goes in between, and then all of the southeast part. Mr. Regula. They do not have any oil, do they? Mr. Watkins. They have very little on the far west side. That touches very little of my overall district. But one thing that has not touched us is the fact that we have been left behind economically speaking, with all the manufacturing. I do not have a Fortune 500 company in my district. I have got some timber in one area that is warehoused, but I do not have big, huge manufacturing. I am a product of out-migration. When I was growing up, my family had to leave three times to go to California and search for jobs. That is what made the burning imprint on my life about going into public life, in order to try to build the economy and build jobs. As I have told people before, I am not in politics as an end, but politics as a vehicle. We are trying to change that. We have done some good, and we have still got a long way to go. The per capita income in my district is about 60 percent of the national average; not the top, but it is about 60 percent of the out-migration. Like I said, we have been doing some good. We have had to do a lot of things on our economic infrastructure. One of the things also that has happened to us is we have been passed by the high technology, the information technology, in that rural area of the state of Oklahoma. The big cities, again, are doing well. What I am trying to do, I am working with Career Tech. Career Tech is the state vocational technical education system all across the state of Oklahoma. I am working with them trying to work through the hub and provide the high tech potential in that area. We call it REVTECH. Last year, the committee provided $921,000. I am asking this year, Mr. Chairman, and I hope you will be able to help us, for about $1.25 million to help work with the State Department of Career Tech. That would allow us, in a lot of those different areas, to be able to provide the necessary wiring, the technology, et cetera, to be able to attract more people. For instance, I work with an industry that is up around Tulsa, but not in my district. They said they could hire 500 more people if they could find trained people. Well, I have got 500 people, but they are scattered throughout my area, if I can get them all together. So that is the one request that we have up at the top of the list. The other is the fact that for many years, I have worked on international trade. The reason for my commitment and dedication to international trade is the fact for every $1 billion of increase in trade, you actually produce about 20,000 jobs. So it makes a lot of sense. Mr. Chairman, I know your background is in rural areas, and some of it is in agriculture. I think, if I recall, you were out on the farm there. We are not going to save rural America just with agriculture alone. I say that with two degrees in agriculture. I love agriculture. But we have got to have off-farm jobs some way to be able to survive or to be able to re-build our small communities. We are working also on the international trade aspect of it at Oklahoma State University, our land grant university there. This committee helped last year with $320,000. I am asking, if you could, give us $750,000, or as close to that as you possibly can. The other thing that you worked with me on last year on the committee was Fragile X, and I am just asking for language as to the help on working with that. That is one of the things that has come along, that has dealt with the retarded. They have made some very scientific breakthroughs, and I have got some language in there for that. The other request, and I have had several others, but this other one is the one new one. It is the Seminole Junior College, or Seminole College. They have got dormitories, but there is some renovation that needs to take place there, if they are going to be able to continue to use them. I am trying to figure out how we can get that done. I have said to community there that I would do my best to try to help them with some renovation some way, if we possibly could. So that would be a big help to that community. Mr. Regula. Is that BIA operated? Mr. Watkins. No, it is not, but there are a large number of Native Americans there. In fact, Mr. Chairman, and you probably know this from your work with the Interior, Oklahoma has got the highest percentage of Native Americans of any state in the nation. In fact, close to 22 percent are in Oklahoma. Mr. Regula. Okay, we will look at them. Mr. Watkins. If you could help me, sir, I would appreciate it very, very much. This is a committee that I felt like there are some things there that maybe you could help us. I really would appreciate it. Mr. Regula. It will depend a lot on what we have available to work with. Mr. Watkins. Being on the Budget Committee, I am trying to do my best to let you have as much as we possibly can. Mr. Regula. We look forward to that, Wes. Mr. Watkins. We will keep pushing for it. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. Mr. Regula. Thank you. [The information follows:] [GRAPHIC(S) NOT AVAILABLE IN TIFF FORMAT] Mr. Regula. Ms. Mink, I see you have various programs, too. ---------- Tuesday, March 27, 2001. VARIOUS PROGRAMS WITNESS HON. PATSY T. MINK, A REPRESENTATIVE IN CONGRESS FROM THE STATE OF HAWAII Mrs. Mink. I brought a very modest list. [Laughter.] Thank you, Mr. Chairman. I do not know how long my voice is going to last, so may I just ask unanimous consent that my testimony be inserted in the record. Mr. Regula. Yes, all the testimony will be included in the record. Mrs. Mink. I also brought with me a letter which 85 members have signed with respect to the ovarian cancer research. I believe you are familiar with my annual trek to this committee, urging that more funds be committed to this research. Mr. Regula. That would be through the NIH. Mrs. Mink. Yes, that is correct. I remember when I started this campaign for funding for research in this area, that the NIH was only spending $7 million. Today, it is up around $70 million, but we need a lot more. It is a very tragic situation where the situation of our research has not come to a point where an early detection test has been found. I believe they are close to it, but until we can find a satisfactory detection for ovarian cancer, we are going to continue to lose many, many thousands of young women. A lot of the women who come down with this are in their mid-to- late 30s. It is very, very tragic. About 23,000 women are diagnosed each year. Most of them are in their late stages, where they cannot be saved. So the mortality every year is about 14,000, which is the highest in the reproductive illnesses. So I think it really takes a determined effort on the part of this committee to recognize the enormous situation that women are in today. There are no symptoms for ovarian cancer, usually, that the doctors can detect by physical examination or by pain or other kinds of things. So unless we have a test, it is not going to be possible to save these lives. So the research is really very, very critical. My bill that I have circulated in the House with about 115 co-sponsors asks for a $150 million commitment. I hope that this committee will find the necessary funds to make that possible. The other institute which I feel needs to have real attention is the National Eye Institute. We are not aware of how many people in America suffer from eye diseases. We need to spend more money on research, money to determine why these illnesses occur, and what can be done to alleviate this condition. Some of it has to do with diabetes and other kinds of related illnesses. But the NEI, which is a separate institute, the National Eye Institute, is currently funded at $510 million. This year, I am hoping that you will be ableto go up to $604 million for this institute. Last year, we had put in a bill asking for the funding to be doubled in at least five years, and we are marching steadily ahead. So I hope that the progress that we have gained in the last several years will not be stayed in any way, and that we will continue. The last item is one that relates to education funding. We are really absolutely transfixed on the fact that our young people are killing each other in our schools for almost no understandable reason. A lot of them are from middle class neighborhoods, coming from well stationed families, without any clear evidences of problems in their homes. The Speaker, Mr. Hastert, established a task force last year on school violence. I was fortunate enough to serve on that. Most of us had various approaches to it. But the one thing that we agreed on was the necessity for having additional staff put into our schools, particularly in the intermediate years. We do not want to call them counsellors, because they already have categories for those people. We do not want to call them social workers or whatever. So we came up with the title, school-based resource staff. The schools could then pick whatever kind of personnel they felt suited for their particular school situation. But what we want to do is to get a ratio of one of these resource staff people per every 250 students. That is still a high ratio, but we think that is a starting point. In order to get there, Mr. Chairman, we have a target of 100,000 additional school-based personnel. I hope you will come up with the funding necessary to support it. Mr. Regula. Would you contemplate 100 percent of that being Federally financed? Mrs. Mink. Yes, 100 percent; it is like 100,000 teachers, to phase them in. But the target is 250 to one ratio, ultimately. Some schools already have that. So they would not be getting into this particular fund. But for those school districts that do not have these extra personnel to take care of handling the students, this is not the chore of the curriculum-type person or the vice principal, who has to do administrative work, or worry about discipline and those kinds of things. This is a school personnel individual that is there solely and exclusively to deal with the students, so they can go to someone with their problems; or if they hear something about someone making some outrageous statements or threats, they can go to this individual, without the fear of peer pressure and so forth. They can go to this individual and tell us staff person what they heard, and let the staff person decide to what level that should be taken. We think that this is a position that the Federal Government can take very, very easily. Our task force that the Speaker appointed unanimously agreed that this is a step that must be taken. So I thank you very much for your consideration. Mr. Regula. Thank you for coming, Patsy. [The information follows:] [GRAPHIC(S) NOT AVAILABLE IN TIFF FORMAT] Mr. Regula. Next is Billy Tauzin from the great state of Louisiana. Boy, you are just getting warmed up down there on your celebrating, are you not? Mr. Tauzin. Lent time is a time for rest. Mr. Regula. So you are resting now, is that it? [Laughter.] Mr. Tauzin. We are paying for our sins. Mr. Regula. Well, you need more than 40 days. Mr. Tauzin. Actually, 40 is a good start. ---------- Tuesday, March 27, 2001. VARIOUS PROGRAMS WITNESS HON. BILLY TAUZIN, A REPRESENTATIVE IN CONGRESS FROM THE STATE OF LOUISIANA Mr. Tauzin. Mr. Chairman, thanks for having me. I bring to you today a young friend of mine who has been before the committee for three years now. His name is Keith Andrus. He is a ninth grade student, and he happens to be the son of my office manager, Rachel Andrus. She and her husband, Ron, are here with me. He is also afflicted with Friedreich's Ataxia. Now Friedreich's Ataxia and Usher Syndrome are very rare disorders which occur in rural medically under-served Cajun populations at a rate of 2.5 times the national average. It is genetically, apparently, connected and, as a result, the Cajun population in my state have severe incidents of this particular disorder. It is rare. It is degenerative. It severely diminishes the physical abilities, and ends up confining patients to wheelchairs by their late teens. The quality of life is heavily comprised and, sadly, because of heart problems, life expectancy is shortened to 37 years. Currently, Mr. Chairman, there is no treatment and no cure. Keith stands as an example of courage, in the face of that kind of a statement: no treatment, no cures. By the way, there are many people across America who face this disorder. There is a young family in Ohio, in Struthers, Ohio. They are a very closely knit family with a mom and dad and three kids. One of the twin boys has Friedreich's Ataxia. That is in your own home state, just asan example. But across America, families like them watch their children grow up knowing that so far, there is no treatment and no cure. We are trying to do something about that. I am pleased to tell you that your subcommittee established at home in Louisiana the Center for Acadiana Genetics and Hereditary Health Care. It was established through a health care outreach grant. It is administered through the Health Resources and Services Administration. For three years, you have helped fund this center. By the way, it is heavily supported at home. Over 50 percent of its support comes from state and voluntary contributions. We are asking your support for the $1.5 million of Federal funding to keep the center open. Mr. Regula. It was $921,000 last year? Mr. Tauzin. Right, and the center, Mr. Chairman, links the School of Medicine, the Biomedical Center, the hospitals, the rural clinics, and a strong telecommunications network to provide urgently needed health services, information, and education regarding these kinds of genetic diseases. By the way, this is, of course, not the only disease that is genetically connected. Through the work of the center, in connection with other genetic research done around the country, we are learning and discovering much more about Usher Syndrome and diseases like diabetes, cancer, heart disease, Alzheimer's, Parkinson's and other psychiatric disorders. But here is this kid and his hope, literally, lies with you. Will we find a cure; will we find a treatment in time? Mr. Regula. Well, we have done a lot with genetics. Mr. Tauzin. We are doing an awful lot. The work that your committee has done is supported at NIH. We, at Energy Commerce, have jurisdiction over at NIH. I want to thank you from the bottom of my heart for the commitment that you have made to NIH. Mr. Regula. You did the authorizing in your committee. Mr. Tauzin. So we are connected here, Mr. Chairman. We will continue to be connected in this vital effort. But the bottom line is that we can not stop this kind of an effort. This kind of an effort may lead to a day when I can bring Keith here and say, guess what, we have found a cure; we have found a treatment in time for him and in time for others like him, and families like him. Mr. Regula. It seems to me that the potential lies in the genetic research that they are doing today. Mr. Tauzin. In fact, at one of the hearings, Mr. Chairman, we heard that work being done in a completely different area yielded some very exciting information that may, in fact, touch upon Friedreich's Ataxia one day. The neat thing about the work being done in all these different areas is that with the human genome completed, we are going to be able to tie some of that work together and discover how one has application on the other. My plea to you today is not for a large sum. I am not asking for half a billion dollars or hundreds of millions of dollars, just $1.5 million to keep literally hope alive for this young man and others like him. I lay it again at your feet and ask you humbly to take it seriously, and to keep this thing alive for him. Mr. Regula. Well, we have a lot of challenges on this committee, as you can fully understand. A lot of what we can do is dependent on funding. We are doing some wonderful things in research, and we hope that this will be one of them. Mr. Tauzin. Oh, I have no doubt that it is. Keith will tell you that he has no doubt. With the advances we are finding, he has no doubt that we are going to find it in time. His family has no doubt. I just want to commend him for his personal courage, and for his family's courage. Mr. Regula. Does he go to school here in Washington? Mr. Tauzin. He is here in school. Go ahead and say hello, Keith. What school do you go to? Mr. Andrus. Woodson High School Mr. Regula. Is it in D.C.? Mr. Andrus. In Virginia. Mr. Regula. In Virginia; that is Fairfax County, probably. Mr. Tauzin. Keith is already having great difficulty walking. As a result, he can not carry hot liquids or liquids, because of health reasons. Every year that Keith has come, the committee has been able to see how the disease is wrecking his frame and hurting his chances for a good healthy, long life. Mr. Regula. Keith, we will make every effort to help the NIH find a cure. Thanks for coming. Mr. Tauzin. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. Thank you all. [The information follows:] [GRAPHIC(S) NOT AVAILABLE IN TIFF FORMAT] Mr. Regula. Yes, Mr. Stupak, you are just in time. ---------- Tuesday, March 27, 2001. PROJECTS WITNESS HON. BART STUPAK, A REPRESENTATIVE IN CONGRESS FROM THE STATE OF MICHIGAN Mr. Stupak. Thank you, Mr. Chairman, Nancy; thanks for giving me the call and saying, come on over in a hurry. I was just down the hall, and I made it. [Laughter.] We have a number of requests for the committee's consideration, today, Mr. Chairman. First, let me start with Operation Uplink. This involves technological assistance to the Upper Peninsula of Michigan. What we are looking for is $2.5 million to fund an initiative to comprehensively design and advance an information-based infrastructure in the Upper Peninsula. What we are really saying is this. Northern Michigan University, Michigan Technological University, Bay de Noc Community College, Marquette General Regional Hospital, our regional libraries, economic development, and local government would like to get linked up. In doing that, we want to look at certain factors which are unique to the Upper Peninsula. If we could get a well-designed telecommunications infrastructure, we would have the opportunity to level the playing field between rural areas, like my district, and the urban areas. Mr. Regula. Would this require fiberoptics, or what type of link are you contemplating? Mr. Stupak. With the technology clusters that we are talking about, and this last mile of connections that theyare talking about, it would be better than the fiberoptics. We have some fiberoptics around Marquette and the rest of the Upper Peninsula. We are talking about high speed Internet, broad band access, things like this. In my district, even with this great economy that had been going for the last few years, the Upper Peninsula still had 5.8 percent unemployment. In Michigan Tech, where part of this is, it is around 10 to 12 unemployment. What we are saying is, in order to compete and to really get our future going, we really would like to have this UP uplink program going. If you take a look at it, Mr. Chairman, it is not much different than what we did. I have introduced legislation in the past to bring electricity, to bring telephones, to bring those services to rural America. This is one region of the country that is geographically unique. We have always had a problem with high unemployment, at 5.8 percent, while the rest of Michigan was 3.6 percent. I said some parts, in the winter months, like on the eastern end of the Upper Peninsula, unemployment is 30 percent. Now when the ice leaves the lakes, as you know, come summertime, they would have virtually no unemployment; but for four or five months out of the year, we are at 30 percent unemployment. What do you do on those cold winter nights? If we had the technology, I think there are a lot of things that we could do and can do. That is where we would like to go with that opportunity. It is $2.5 million. I would hope that you would take a look at that request. The next one is for our gerontological studies, basically for senior citizens. Again, this is at Northern Michigan University, the Upper Peninsula. Our population is about 12 percent senior citizens. On the western end, again, we just did a study in Kohebic, in Ougan Counties, and it is 25 to 30 percent of older population that is 65 and older. While we would like to use the center for research, education, community service in rural Michigan, that is related to older individuals and the aging process. It would be the knowledge of the aging process and the aging network, and its service provisions apply information as a mechanism to enhance the lives of people who reside in rural communities like Michigan's upper peninsula. This would be worked out in Northern Michigan. Again, these two programs almost go hand in hand. Thirdly, Mr. Chairman, Northwestern Michigan College, you helped them out last year. This is in Traverse City. Again, they want to operate a life-long learning center on the West Bay Campus. The senior citizen center is there. It is a waterfront area. The lifelong learning center would be the hub for participatory learning for faculty, staff, and students at Northwestern Michigan Community College in Grand Traverse County. As you know, Mr. Chairman, this is probably one of the fastest growing areas of Michigan. Retirees leave the auto plants in southern Michigan and they come up to my district to retire. Traverse City and Northwestern Michigan have been a leader in trying to provide senior programs. Again, this would go with Northwestern Michigan College in Traverse City. Last, but not least, the Olympic Scholarship is a program that we have been here a couple of times, advocating for in the last two years. You have funded it, which has helped out many athletes. Athletes train at our four Olympic Centers in Marquette, Michigan; Lake Placid, New York; Colorado Spring, Colorado; and outside San Diego, California. These athletes, most of them are young people. They are in sports such as speed skating, boxing, Greco-Roman wrestling, many of the Nordic sports. There are no scholarships for them. But they are willing to train. They take money out of their own pockets. They go all over the nation, doing training, competing. They go to Europe, where they get some help. At the same time, many of these people would also like a degree. Even if you won the gold medal in Greco-Roman wrestling, I do not know how you could make that into some kind of an economic benefit for the rest of your life, or speed skating. Even though we may win the gold medal, like some of the athletes that came out of Marquette, a couple of Olympics ago, and we may win the speed skating, there is no career in that. There is nothing. So where they are putting in all the hours, we think we should have an Olympic education training center, as Northern Michigan and these others are, and let them go to school, give them a scholarship, let them train. The boxers start at 5:00 in the morning. I have been up there talking to them many times. Many of them come from inner cities. Many of them come from poor backgrounds. They are there, and if it was not for the Olympic scholarships, not only could they not probably participate and train and work for the Olympics, but at the same time, they are getting a quality education. So the Olympic scholarships have been a great advantage to the four sites throughout this country. I hope you would fund it again. That is a quick overview. Like I said, I literally ran down here, and I think I ran through my report, too. But it is all here, and it is 15 pages. I am not going to read it. But if you have any questions on any of these three programs, that I have outlined, I would be happy to answer any questions. [The information follows:] [GRAPHIC(S) NOT AVAILABLE IN TIFF FORMAT] are there any questions? [No response.] Mr. Regula. Thank you. The Olympic Center is named after your son, I believe. Mr. Stupak. Yes, that is true, and I thank the committee for that courtesy that they have shown us. Thank you. Mr. Regula. Thank you. Next is Representative Danny Davis. ---------- Tuesday, March 27, 2001. CONSOLIDATED HEALTH CENTERS WITNESS HON. DANNY DAVIS, A REPRESENTATIVE IN CONGRESS FROM THE STATE OF ILLINOIS Mr. Davis. Thank you very much, Mr. Chairman and members of the subcommittee. I am pleased to provide the subcommittee with testimony in support of the urgent need to increase funding by $250 million for the Consolidated Health Centers Program; that is community, migrant, homeless, and public housing health centers, to at least $1.419 billion for fiscal year 2002. I realize that this committee has been very supportive of the community health center program in the past. In fact, members on both sides of the aisle of this committee have united to advance this program. It is a true testament of the integral role health centers play in the delivery of health care for this nation. I appreciate the committee's support last year of our request for a $150 million increase. Unfortunately, the $150 million increase has only enabled health centers to serve 10 percent of the Nation's 43 million uninsured people. With the uninsured population continuing to grow at a rate of over 100,000 individuals per month, it is estimated that the uninsured population will reach over 53 million by 2007. There is no question that much more needs to be done to expand health center services to reach more uninsured people, and to continue to provide quality care to existing health center patients. I applause President Bush's recent call to double the number of patients served by community health centers, enabling millions more to have access to the most basic health care. In fact, the President's budget has recommended a modest increase of $124 million for the health center program. I believe that is a good start, but because of the demand for health care and the rise in the number of uninsured, I believe we will need to raise that number to $250 million. With an additional $250 million, health centers will be able to serve and expand facilities in rural and urban communities, and see an additional 700 patients. Our nation is still divided when it comes to health care; that is, those who have and those who have not. I have had the good fortune to work directly with and in community health centers, prior to running for public office. It has been my testament and my goodwill to see that there is no other group of centers or programs in the nation that has been able to provide the kind of access to health care that these centers have given. So, Mr. Chairman, I would urge that we seriously look at increasing by $250 million, so that all of the uninsured people in this country, who would then benefit, would come out of the uninsured, to the serviced area. I thank you, Mr. Chairman. It has been a pleasure to be here. [The information follows:] [GRAPHIC(S) NOT AVAILABLE IN TIFF FORMAT] Mr. Regula. They use a lot of volunteers, am I correct, in the community health centers? Mr. Davis. Well, they used to. Volunteerism in this country is not quite what it used to be. They use volunteers. But these centers basically started out of the old OEO programs. They were put in urban and rural communities where nothing hardly was there. Many of them have become the centerpieces for economic development in those communities, as well, and they are the biggest thing there. They provide not only health care, but they have provided employment opportunities, business and economic development opportunities, and they are pretty much considered to be community-owned. People feel really good about them. Mr. Regula. I am sure that is true. We have one in our area. Are there any questions? [No response.] Mr. Davis. Thank you very much, Mr. Chairman and members of the committee. Mr. Regula. Thank you. Next is my colleague from Ohio, Mr. Kucinich. ---------- Tuesday, March 27, 2001. UNITED STATES HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES WITNESS HON. DENNIS KUCINICH, A REPRESENTATIVE IN CONGRESS FROM THE STATE OF OHIO Mr. Kucinich. Good afternoon, Mr. Chairman. Mr. Regula. Dennis, we are happy to welcome you. Mr. Kucinich. It is my pleasure to be in front of your subcommittee. I appreciate it very much. Good afternoon to my colleagues; I appreciate the chance to be in front in your committee. With the permission of the Chair, I will begin whenever it is appropriate. Mr. Regula. Go ahead. Mr. Kucinich. Thank you very much for the opportunity to appear before the committee. I am urging the committee to prevent the use of Federal funds for prolonging the public comment period of the final Medical Privacy Standards. Last month, a new 30-day comment period was opened on the standards mandated by the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act, and several industries are lobbying to extend the period even further. These regulations are long overdue. When Congress passed HIPAA in 1996 with strong bipartisan support, it required HHS to promulgate rules by August 23rd, 1999, if Congress did not legislate. During HHS' work on the regulations, Congress and other interested parties articulated their views. In September, 1997, the Secretary of HHS submitted a health privacy report to Congress and testified before the Senate Committee on Labor and Human Resources. Several bills were introduced. The proposed rule was published in November, 1999. Industry and consumer groups asked for the comment period to be extended, and HHS pushed the deadline back by 45 days. The rule generated extraordinary feedback; 52,000 comments. Clearly, the health care and insurance industries have had ample opportunity to make their voices heard, and have done so. Now the industry groups seeks to weaken the medical privacy law by delaying the rule's implementation. The rule already allows health plans two years to comply, and gives small plans an additional year beyond that deadline. These groups do not have a leg to stand on in lobbying for continued delay. They have had plenty of input into the regulations, have known for five years that the regulation was forthcoming, and now have another two to three years to meet the deadline. By not implementing the rule, not only are the medical privacy of patients put at risk, but so is the privacy of their Social Security numbers, the privacy of their financial information, their ability to maintain health coverage, and even keep a job. That is really the core of this. Here are some examples of abuses that have occurred because of the lack of medical privacy laws. Last December, Terry Sergeant, a North Carolina resident, was fired from her job, after being diagnosed with an expensive genetic disorder. Three weeks before being fired, she was given a positive review at work and a raise. She suspects her self-insured employer found out about her condition and fired her to avoid the medical expense. A truck driver in Atlanta was fired from his job after his employer learned that he had previously sought treatment for a drinking problem. A California woman requested that her pharmacy not disclose her prescription information to her husband, from whom she had separated. When he contacted the pharmacy, he received a copy of all of her prescription records, and then gave them to the rest of the family, her friends, the Department of Motor Vehicles and others, claiming she was a drug addict and a danger to her children. A banker who served on his county's health board cross- referenced his customer accounts with patient information, and then called the mortgages of anyone with cancer. The University of Michigan Medical Center inadvertently put several thousand patient records on public Internet sites for two months in 1999. Only when a student searching for information about a doctor found links to private patient records with numbers, job status, medical treatments and other information was the problem discovered. It goes on and on and on, Mr. Chairman. I will submit, with the Chair's permission, all of this testimony. But what it comes down to is that the implementation of the Medical Privacy Rules on April 14th ought to be strongly considered. Americans long ago asked Congress to respond to the threat of vulnerable privacy records, and many have already suffered from abuse of private information made public. This committee can ensure that these protections go into effect if you prohibit the use of funds in this bill to delay the implementation of the medical privacy regulations any longer. I am here presenting this in my capacity as the Chair of the Progressive Caucus. I thank the Chair for his indulgence and I thank the members. Thank you. [The information follows:] [GRAPHIC(S) NOT AVAILABLE IN questions? [No response.] Mr. Regula. Thank you. Mr. Kucinich. Thank you and good afternoon. Mr. Regula. Do we have any other members here? Don Young is the next one on the list. Mr. Kucinich. Mr. Chairman, in concluding, I am just going to submit all of this record, if the Chair would accept it. Mr. Regula. Oh, yes, all statements are part of the record. Ms. Pelosi. Would the Chair yield? Mr. Regula. Yes, certainly. Ms. Pelosi. Mr. Chairman, I do not know whether you saw it last night, but on TV on PBS, they had a special presentation. What it consisted of, largely, is something of interest to the committee. It was about environmental health. What it was, it was the release of documents from the chemical industry, as to what they knew and when they knew it, about danger to workers in the work place, and communities surrounding these factories. Last year, as I have mentioned a couple of times in our hearings, under Chairman Porter's leadership, we had a hearing on environmental health. Scientists came and talked about the need for bio-monitoring to monitor what people are breathing and drinking in the water, from chemicals in the environment. It was a very important hearing. In fact, I have been on the committee, and others who have been on it longer, do not recall us ever having a hearing on a single subject. Usually, we have hearings of this kind. So that hearing, plus the funding and the generosity of this committee to fund the CDC over the last four years to increase the funding of the environmental health project, have taken us a long way down the road to having an understanding of the connection between health or disease and chemicals in the atmosphere or in the water. I would commend Moyer's show to the Chairman's attention, and to all of our colleague's attention. Certainly, we want to have a balanced approach as to how we go forward. We do not want to do anything that is not science-based. But certainly, on behalf of our children's health, we really do not know what risk we are putting children at. Of course, because they are younger and developing, they are impacted more directly and more negatively than older people. Mr. Regula. Well, it seems to me, we have had an EPA for many years, and we have all these agencies. Would they not have a vast body of knowledge about these types of hazards? Ms. Pelosi. You would think so. In the testing that is done, you know, they will test the air, they will test the water, and they will test this or that. But this is the work that we are doing now to see what to monitor in human beings. Because of the generosity of this committee over the past few years, the CDC is in a much better position to do some of the monitoring, which I think you have heard in one of the points that Mr. Stokes made, when he was here, on the environmental health issue that he is working and that monitoring. Then we see that children have higher incidences of asthma, because of the atmosphere in which they live and that the connection between the environment and health is a direct one. The committee has taken the lead on this. I think it would be interesting to see some more evidence on that. Mr. Regula. What conclusions did Moyer reach, or what recommendations, if any? Ms. Pelosi. Well, the whole point was that we have to have data. We have to have a ground truth on the basis of which we go forward. Even the chemical industry admitted in their own statements that we really do not know what some of the risks are to these. Even though they have set out to make some tests, they have not done them, yet. Again, this is information that would be useful to the committee. The committee has to have a scientific basis and data on which to make judgments. This is another piece of information that I think would be useful to the committee, as it balances its decisions. Mr. Regula. Where did you see this? Ms. Pelosi. It was on PBS, and it was called ``Trade Secrets.'' Basically, what it was, a lot of the chemical industries, over the past 40 years, have known the danger that their chemicals have posed to the public, but have kept that information from the public. Indeed, in their own documentation, they show how, when they were going to go to NOISH, which is the science part. OSHA is the work place safety and NOISH is the scientific research part of it. They said, well we cannot deny if they ask us, but we will not volunteer the information, even though NOISH had put out a call for all information regarding some of these chemicals in the atmosphere. So it is interesting. Mr. Peterson [assuming chair]. I think the situation with liability that we have, I know ladder companies, and this is on the whole safety side, were hesitant to improve the ladder, because they admit then that the ladder was not as strong and safe as it could have been with the new improvements, and they were instantly liable, if anybody got hurt on the old ladder, so they never put the new structure out or changed it. I have a feeling that companies, as they improve their processes, realize that they have come up with a new process that is better than how they were doing it, but instantly are liable to the trial lawyers for cases, because they have now improved the process. They have found out how to reduce it. I mean, I really think this thing cuts both ways. Ms. Pelosi. I say we have to balance that. You bring up an interesting point. When I say this was a trade secret, all of this was largely a presentation of their own documents, of the documents of the chemical industry that are now public. One of the things that does not relate to workman's comp or anything like that is, for example, hair spray, and what is involved in aerosol hair spray. If you have it in the work place, you have some protection in liability, because of workman's comp and this or that. But once that is proven to be a danger to the general public, then it is a different dynamic, if you were to be sued or something like that. So they have, in this case, even more reason to keep the information secret, not because of what it meant in terms of work place, but what it meant in terms of the general public. I see that one of our colleagues has arrived. Again, this would be a good committee, because we have the CDC. We have the NIH. We have the science at NOISH. We have the scientific institutions, as part of our dynamics. We do not want to proceed on a notion or emotion. We want to proceed on the basis of science. This is a very valuable contribution, in terms of avoiding the science. We have a different responsibility, I think. But we do have responsibility for balance, and I look forward to working with you on that. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. Mr. Regula [resuming chair]. Thank you, Nancy. We have a health care task force group. The first speaker in that group will be our friend from Ohio, again, Mr. Kucinich, and I believe Ms. Christenson is here, also. Ms. Pelosi. Mr. Chairman, I am sorry, I did realize Mr. Kucinich was coming forward again, or I would not have continued. Mr. Regula. No, that is all right. I think it is a real problem. Ms. Pelosi. For everything that I have said, it is more so in minority communities and disadvantaged communities, because that is where a lot of these chemicals are. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. Mr. Regula. Thank you. Representative Kucinich. ---------- Tuesday, March 27, 2001. HEALTH CARE INSURANCE PORTABILITY AND ACCOUNTABILITY ACT (HIPAA) WITNESS HON. DENNIS KUCINICH, CHAIR, CONGRESSIONAL PROGRESSIVE CAUCUS HEALTH CARE TASK FORCE Mr. Kucinich. Mr. Chairman, it is a pleasure to be a part of your committee once again. I thank you very much for the chance to appear, and to Ms. Pelosi. I saw that two hour program. We will have a chance to chat about it soon; thank you. I am here on behalf of the Congressional Progressive Caucus, of which I am the Chair, and to address some issues that I know this committee is very concerned about. America is home to the most advanced medical research facilities and scientists in the world. In part, that is because this committee has provided funding and guidance to achieve it. I am pleased that so many of my colleagues have supported doubling the budget at the National Institute of Health. I think we all appreciate the priority of finding therapies and cures for diseases and other ailments to improve public health; but America is home to irony, as well. For example, the United States ranks 25th among other nations in infant mortality rates, which is twice the rate of Singapore, which has the lowest rate. These statistics reflect the gross failure of our health system to provide access to adequate prenatal care. Every day, 410 babies are born to mothers who receive late or no prenatal care, according to the National Center for Health Statistics. African American infants are more than twice as likely as white infants to die before their first birthday. Among others, the United States ranks 20th in maternal mortality levels. According to the World Health Organization, half of these could be prevented through early diagnosis and appropriate medical care of pregnancy complications. For a country with advanced medical technology, it is unfortunate that mothers and infants do not have access to basic preventive health care. This example illustrates the broader point that this committee must also fund programs to get cures that we pay for to the people who need them, prevent disease, and ensure a minimum level of health care to every American. The AIDS crisis in our country requires a comprehensive strategy, meaning prevention therapy and research for a cure. Up to 900,000 Americans are now infected with HIV, and half of this population is under the age of 25. This committee, I hope, will be able to fund the following programs at the Centers for Disease Control to prevent infection and provide care for those who are infected: prevention activities that depend on CDC funds given to local health departments; HIV Prevention Community Planning Groups, and the Substance Abuse Prevention and Treatment Block Grant. The minority HIV/AIDS Initiative works on both prevention and providing care resources in communities of color, where the major of new AIDS cases occur. In order to provide care for those infected with HIV, the Ryan White CARE Act and the Housing Opportunities for People with AIDS Program support a range of services. This coordinated group of programs is crucial to dealing with the HIV virus, and all should be fully funded. The Progressive Caucus is also asking that the committee raise its funding level of support to programs under the Health Resources and Services Division that are critical to maintain a skilled health work force. They have a number of other recommendations here, which I would ask the Chair and the committee to please give their thoughtful consideration to. As any of the health programs we are talking about, the solution needs to be comprehensive. Besides research and development of therapies, we must train doctors and nurses in new therapies, for us to have medical professionals serve in shortage areas of the country. This strategy must also include educating people about how to take care of their own health, and exercise preventive strategies. Prevention is the best medicine. Mr. Chairman, the committee has been a leader in providing for health advances in our country. I ask it to continue to be a leader by funding initiatives to make health advances accessible to all Americans. I thank the Chair, and thanks to all the members for your time.

CONGRESSIONAL BLACK CAUCUS HEALTH CARE TASK FORCE WITNESS HON. DONNA M. CHRISTIAN-CHRISTENSEN, A DELEGATE FROM THE U.S. VIRGIN ISLANDS, CHAIR, CONGRESSIONAL BLACK HEALTH CARE TASK FORCE Ms. Christensen. Thank you. Good afternoon, Mr. Chairman and members of the subcommittee. It is a pleasure to be here. Mr. Chairman, I want to begin by congratulating you on your assumption of the Chair of this new subcommittee. As Chair of the Interior Subcommittees for several years, my constituents have been the beneficiary of your leadership. Of course, the territories are a part of the health dilemma that we are going to discuss this afternoon. It is one which is defined by grave disparities in health care status. The subcommittee has my full testimony. I am going to summarize and also clarify a few points in it, if I might. First, the funding, including my request in the CBC and HIV and AIDS minority initiative, is not intended just for African Americans, but for all communities of color. It also extends to people living in our rural areas. Second, the request is additional to and not intended to supplant or take away from any other Department of Health and Human Services funding. Indeed, we are requesting that the department's budget be fully funded, at least at the 2001 level. Third, the request, which includes our HIV and AIDS initiative, is for $1 billion for fiscal year 2002, and hopefully for subsequent years through 2006. Fourth, while they do not come under the jurisdiction of this subcommittee, we have included in our overall agenda, universal coverage in the full lifting in the cap on Medicaid for the territories. We hope for your support, as well as the support of other subcommittee members on this initiative. My testimony here today, however, is on the state of African American health in this country, and what I think it will take to adequately address it. In any discussion on the health of people of African descent in the United States, it is important that it be framed in the context of what is called the Slave Health Deficit; 400 years of health care, deferred or denied, a deficit that has never been made up. Even at the dawn of this new century and millennium, African Americans have the lowest life expectancy of any other population group in this country, and the gap has widened, actually, since 1985. Today, hundreds of African Americans will die from preventable diseases. This number is increased over the last 20 years. Deaths from heart disease are 38 percent higher in black males and 68 percent higher in black females. In recent years, our death rate due to stroke was about 75 percent higher than in our white counterparts. The prevalence of diabetes in African Americans is almost 70 percent higher than in whites; and with less access to care, African Americans suffer more amputations, blindness and kidney failure. The infant mortality gap has widened since 1985, and ours is twice that of our white counterparts. Over 50 percent of all new HIV infections annually are in African Americans, and we make up 45 percent of all AIDS cases, and we are only about 13 percent of the total population. An African American male is almost eight times as likely to have AIDS as his white counterpart, and for women, that is about twenty times more likely. Mr. Chairman, our health agenda in the request to the subcommittee makes an attempt to address the causes of disparities. The facts that I have just recited just barely scratch the surface. Twenty-three percent of African Americans are uninsured. Many have Medicaid; but recent studies have called into question the quality of care, and in particular, for HIV/AIDS, that Medicaid recipients have received. Much current research has demonstrated that even with insurance, and when other factors are equal, African Americans and particularly women experience clear discrimination in their receipt of health care services. On the other hands, when language, ethnicity, and culture are the same or similar, research shows better rapport and, therefore, better compliance and outcomes. Mental health services are severely lacking for American Americans at all ages. Put simply, according to our Surgeon General, Dr. David Satcher, the U.S. mental health system is not well equipped to meet the needs of racial and ethnic minority populations. All of these and other factors conspire to create the disparities that exist for African Americans, as well as other people of color. They form the basis for our request. As discussed briefly in the full testimony, they are: allotting full funding for the new Center for Minority and Disparity Health Research at NIH, as well as having the other offices of minority health in the agencies funded. The $1 billion request would provide the following: increase health providers of color; provide adequate staff for our medically under-served areas; enhance the ability of our providers to practice their art and to provide for ethnics and diversity training in our health profession schools, and collect important health data. These are provisions of the Minority and Disparity Education Act of 2000. It would increase and provide culturally and linguistically sensitive mental health services in communities of color; adequately fund the community health centers, which are the nexus of health care for our communities; provide adequate health services for inmates in correctional facilities; provide adequate outreach and funding for immunization programs; continue and expandthe CDC minority AIDS initiative. Mr. Chairman, in 1998, the Congressional Black Caucus, joined by community organizations and health advocates from around the country, called on Secretary Donna Shalala to declare a state of emergency for HIV and AIDS in the African American community and other communities of color. What we achieved was a declaration of a severe and ongoing crisis; and to have, first $156 million in 1999; $249 million in 2000; and this year, $350 million targeted to communities of color. This initiative, which needs to be expanded, has been effective, and it has been affected across all communities of color. However, we made one mistake; we should have called for a state of emergency in the overall health of African Americans and other people of color. It is this emergency, that for the health of African Americans and for people of color, across all of the diseases, which is the emergency that truly exists. With the full funding of the request before you today, which this country today has the resources to do, we can begin to respond appropriately to the crisis that exists in health care for our communities today. Under your leadership, this country can make the moral and political commitment to guarantee access to medical care as a fundamental right to all of its people. I thank you, Mr. Chairman and subcommittee members, for the opportunity to testify. I will be happy to answer any questions. [The information follows:] [GRAPHIC(S) NOT AVAILABLE IN TIFF FORMAT] Ms. Pelosi. I just have a brief question. Mr. Regula. Yes, go ahead. Ms. Pelosi. I was so impressed by the very important testimony that our colleague has presented. It stands on its own, and her credentials are well known to us. But I would like her to put on the record her credentials as a health professional, and all that she brings to this testimony today, Mr. Chairman. We are so proud of her. Ms. Christensen. I should have said that I chair the Health Braintrust of the Congressional Black Caucus. I am a family physician, and have been in practice for 21 years in the Virgin Islands, also. I was a public health official in the Virgin Islands for many of those years. Mr. Regula. Well, that is a vanishing group, the family physicians. Ms. Christensen. Yes, and that is the pearl of American health. Mr. Regula. I agree with you. I felt strongly that we should encourage more family physicians. You cannot just take one area of a human being, and not be sensitive to the whole person. Ms. Christensen. I suspect that it will come back. Mr. Regula. Probably economics are driving it, as much as anything. With the high costs that students have, they feel like the specialties pay better. Ms. Christensen. Well, they do. That is another area that has to be addressed, in terms of the reimbursement. I know that HCFA is going to be under much scrutiny this year. Hopefully, some of those issues will be addressed. Mr. Regula. Well, it is great what you did. Were you in a smaller community? Ms. Christensen. I practiced in the Virgin Islands. I was always able to make house calls, for most of practice. The island that I practice on has between 50,000 and 60,000 people. Mr. Regula. There are others besides you there, I hope? Ms. Christensen. Yes. [Laughter.] Mr. Regula. That would keep you busy. Well, thank you for bringing this to our attention. Ms. Christensen. You are welcome. Thank you, again, for the opportunity to testify. Mr. Regula. Next, we have our friend from Alaska. ---------- Tuesday, March 27, 2001. CLOSE UP FOUNDATION WITNESS HON. DON YOUNG, A REPRESENTATIVE IN CONGRESS FROM THE STATE OF ALASKA Mr. Young. I have a very short statement that I will read in its entirety, primarily because the staffer wrote it, and this is the first time she ever wrote anything for me. Mr. Regula. I thought you were going to say that it was the first time you ever asked for any. Mr. Young. No, not really. [Laughter.] I will say, Mr. Chairman and members of the committee, I would suggest, as we have new members on this committee that have not been involved in the Close Up Program, and that is what I am here today to talk about. The Ellender Fellowship Program is a critical component in Close Up's educational program to educate our Nation's young people about how our Federal system of Government works, and their rights and responsibilities as citizens. Congress created the Allen J. Ellender Program in 1972, out of a belief that our Nation was at a critical juncture in ensuring that the next generation of Americans would share in the values and beliefs of the preceding generations, who forged our democratic form of government. By the way, Mr. Chairman and members of the committee, 1972 was the first year that I ran for this job. I believe that we must ensure the present generation of young Americans is committed to the ideals of active citizenship, service to the community, and loyalty to country, that are the foundation of our democratic system of government. We must be dedicated to educating young people about civic virtue and teaching them about their place in our democracy. Our national heritage includes an unwavering belief in the importance of each and every citizen to the success and health of our democracy. The Close Up Foundation has embraced this belief and made it an integral part of its mission to educate young people. Close Up is dedicated to the principle that the poorest among our Nation's young people should have an opportunity to come to Washington to gain first-hand experience in how our Government works. The Close Up Foundation utilizes the Ellender Fellowship Program to reach out to student populations that are among the most economically needy and under-served. The Ellender Fellowship recipients include students from our Native American, immigrant, rural and inner city communities. As the State of Alaska's sole representative in the House, I have had the privilege to meet with numerous students from Alaska, visiting Washington as part of the Close Up's civic education program. Mr. Chairman and members of the committee, we have had 11,000, since the beginning of this program, from Alaska, that have come to participate in this good program. For students in rural Alaska, Washington, D.C. is far removed from their everyday lives, and is a place that operates in a way that they may not fully understand. Many of these students do not have access to C-Span, so they have never seen Congress in action. Close Up recognizes that their geographic isolation does not mean they play less of a role in the future of our country. I believe that we should be highly supportive of programs that successfully aid young people in becoming well-rounded, informed, and active citizens. The Allen J. Ellender Fellowship Program provides teachers and economically disadvantaged students with a unique opportunity to travel to Washington, and learn first-hand about Government. A health democracy depends upon the participation of its citizens. This critical education program deserves our full attention and our full support. In closing, I would ask the subcommittee to recognize the critically needed work of the Close Up Foundation through continued and increased funding of the Allen J. Ellender Fellowship Program. I want to thank you, Mr. Chairman and members of the subcommittee. As I said, this is a short statement. I wouldbe willing to answer any questions. Again, I want to stress, there are 11,000 Alaskan students who have participated in this program. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. [The information follows:] [GRAPHIC(S) NOT AVAILABLE IN TIFF FORMAT] Mr. Regula. Are there any questions? The Ellender Fellowship or Foundation provides money for students to participate, who otherwise would not be able to? Mr. Young. That is the primary purpose of this program, to have those people in from the rural areas and impoverished area; and believe me, we still have them in Alaska, to come to Washington, D.C. We do have other schools that do participate in this in here, from a more influential group of people. However, we are a long ways away, and it has been very good for the State of Alaska. Mr. Regula. Is Ellender just confined to Alaska? Mr. Young. No, it is nationwide; it is huge. Alaska has participated in it. I have helped raise money in the private sector for this program. Mr. Regula. Well, you have had 11,000 over what period of time? Mr. Young. Since 1972. Mr. Regula. Given your population base, that is still a lot. Mr. Young. Yes, that is a lot of them; and if we had the same population, same ratio, it would be over 250,000 in California. We really do participate in this program. Mr. Regula. Yes, they do. Well, thank you for coming today. Mr. Young. I am pleased to see that my two new members did not ask me any questions. I was not sure that I could answer them. But thank you, Mr. Chairman, and congratulations to you. Mr. Porter sat in that chair for many years, and I know you will do a wonderful job. Mr. Regula. He did a great job when he was here. Mr. Young. And you will do equally as well. Thank you very much. Next is Mr. Fattah from Pennsylvania. ---------- Tuesday, March 27, 2001. CONGRESSIONAL BLACK CAUCUS EDUCATIONAL BRAIN TRUST WITNESSES HON. CHAKA FATTAH, A REPRESENTATIVE IN CONGRESS FROM THE COMMONWEALTH OF PENNSYLVANIA, ON BEHALF OF REP. MAJOR OWEN, A REPRESENTATIVE IN CONGRESS FROM THE STATE OF NEW YORK, CHAIR, CONGRESSIONAL BLACK CAUCUS EDUCATIONAL BRAIN TRUST HON. RUBEN E. HINOJOSA, A REPRESENTATIVE IN CONGRESS FROM THE STATE OF TEXAS, CONGRESSIONAL HISPANIC CAUCUS Mr. Fattah. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. If you do not mind, I have asked my good friend, Congressman Hinojosa, to join me, because we share a similar interest, and we could expedite the committee's work. Mr. Regula. That is fine. Mr. Fattah. Let me thank you for allowing me to pitch hit for Congressman Major Owens, who was scheduled to provide this testimony, and is unable to do so. I am going to let my written testimony stand for the record. I would like to thank the Chairman, because of his tremendous interest in a variety of matters, relative to education. I am not going to belabor any of the points that need to be made. I would also like to welcome my two colleagues from Pennsylvania, Congressman Peterson and Sherwood, who have served with me before in the State Senate, and worked on education-related matters. We have a lot of mutual interests. Let me say on behalf of the Congressional Black Caucus, the Caucus has laid out a number of positions, which are articulated in the written testimony about the need for this committee's continued support. This committee really has been in the vanguard of pushing for a set of programs and initiatives that have helped hundreds of thousands of young people live up to their potential, pursue an adequate education, and to go on to higher education. There is an emphasis, obviously, on the Pell Grant and the Trio Programs and, most particularly, the Gear Up Program, which is close to my heart. I want to thank the committee for its support over the last three cycles for its support for Gear Up, which I authored and moved through the House, with a lot of help from a lot of different people. It is now helping over one million young people in our country. Mr. Regula. You introduced me to it, when we were down at St. Petersburg. Mr. Fattah. That is right, and it is a tremendous program. It is doing very, very well. But I know that this subcommittee will have an allocation, and you have some very difficult decisions to make. I respect whatever deliberations and outcomes there will be from the result of that. There are a lot of choices from Head Start on through in the education pipeline, to help move young people and their families. However, in terms of the Congressional Black Caucus and the Hispanic Caucus, we represent constituencies that these programs impact most acutely, and they are very important, too. So we just want to urge you to do all that you can do. I would also say that I am very concerned, and I will betestifying before the House Education Committee tomorrow, about the whole question of how to encourage states to do more themselves to give disadvantaged and poor communities, both in urban and rural areas, an equal educational opportunity. Part of the problem is that the Federal Government is trying to help make up the deficit that is the result of a lack of full support from our state governments in the poor communities in those states. We need to work more as a Congress to try to encourage states to treat both our rural school districts and urban school districts in a way in which young people will get a fair and an equal opportunity. I know that we cannot legislate outcomes, but I think that we could do more to encourage states not to have poor children, who are already disadvantaged, made more disadvantaged by the way that they create their funding cycles and dispense curriculums around the state. Nancy Pelosi, in the great State of California, knows that there is a major litigation going on there in which young people in Compton High have little or no opportunity to take AP courses; and young people at Berkeley High have more than 25 AP courses to choose from. It just creates a circumstance in which not every young person can pursue, within their own potential, what God-given talents they have. So I just think, Mr. Chairman, that your committee will make a lot of tough decisions about allocations and programmatic thrusts. We can also do more by encouraging these states to take their children, and to give not just the wealthy, middle class suburban youngsters every opportunity, but to also make sure that those who are impoverished, who live in rural and urban communities in their states, to have the same opportunity to have quality teachers in the classroom, good facilities, and an adequate curriculum to prepare them. So thank you, Mr. Chairman. [The information follows:] [GRAPHIC(S) NOT AVAILABLE IN TIFF FORMAT] Mr. Regula. I think it is a universal thing. Ohio is going through the same type of lawsuit, involving Appalachia. Mr. Fattah. Yes. Mr. Regula. Mr. Hinojosa. Mr. Hinojosa. Thank you very much, Mr. Chairman. On behalf of the Congressional Hispanic Caucus, CHC, I want to thank you and the members of the Appropriations Committee for allowing Chaka and me to come before you and discuss the educational needs of the African American children, Hispanic children, and all minority children in the United States. I want to preface my remarks by saying that I have only served four years in Congress. As I start my fifth year, I want to say that it has been a real pleasure for me to collaborate with Chaka Fattah. Both of us serve on the Education Committee, and we are well informed and certainly committed to work on trying to help children graduate from high school and go on to higher education. It is no doubt that two caucuses, the Black Caucus and Hispanic Caucus, working together, are beginning to really make a difference in bringing to the forefront the importance of educating children early: Early Start, Head Start, Gear Up, K- 12 programs that are exemplary in helping students graduate from high school, and then of course bringing a great deal of attention to the work that is being done by HSIs and HBCUs. All of this is to say that some of the senior members of committees that I serve on in Education have commented that never before have they seen the collaborative work being done by the Black Caucus and the Hispanic Caucuses. So I thank you for this opportunity. As you know, the Census Bureau projects that by the year 2030, Hispanic children will represent 25 percent of the total student population. Census figures already indicate that Hispanics have become the Nation's largest minority. In my area, the largest county that I represent, Hidalgo County, has grown to 88 percent in population. Mr. Regula. Where is that located in Texas? Mr. Hinojosa. It is south of San Antonio, 250 miles. Hidalgo County is on the Texas border region, between Brownsville and Laredo, an area that is the third fastest MSA in the country. It is an area that in my own district, it has grown by 50 percent over the last 10 years. Mr. Regula. That would be southwest then; am I correct? Mr. Hinojosa. We are considered the Southwest. Texas is so spread out that I am 850 miles from west Texas and El Paso. I am 650 miles from Dallas. It is an area that is just growing by leaps and bounds. Mr. Regula. Where do you fly to go home? Mr. Hinojosa. I fly Houston, and then Houston to McAllen. It takes me seven hours. Mr. Regula. But you are not on the Gulf of Mexico, though? Mr. Hinojosa. No, I am approximately an hour. Solomon Ortiz represents the coastal area from Brownsville to Corpus Christie; and I run parallel with him, from McAllen to San Antonio; Rodriguez is parallel with mine, from Rio Grande City to San Antonio. Then the fourth one would be Henry Bonilla from Laredo to San Antonio. All that area has grown so much that we are going to get two new Congressional Districts in that area. Mr. Fattah. They are taking those from Pennsylvania, right? [Laughter.] Mr. Regula. They are both going to be Republican; is that right? Mr. Fattah. We will see. NOT AVAILABLE IN TIFF FORMAT] Are any questions from the members? [No response.] Mr. Hinojosa. I want to say that the amounts that are in my prepared material have some very specific numbers that we are asking, as the Congressional Hispanic Caucus, on the Appropriation funding that we are asking. For example, on Title 1, we are asking for a level of funding of $24 billion. If you ask why it is that much, the reason is that we are not serving all of the eligible children. So what we did is, we took the number that are eligible and multiplied it, because it is a formula-funded program, and it would take $24 billion to serve all those that are qualified and eligible. The Caucus also is suggesting a funding level of $508 million for Title 7 of the ESEA. Another figure that is very important to us is the request for $500 million for adult continuation programs. Mr. Regula. That is a pretty hefty increase that you are proposing. Mr. Hinojosa. We are, simply because this is the time that President Bush is saying that education is the foremost important issue. If we are going to do what he says, and not leave any child behind, then it is going to take getting up to the funding level that will reach all the children, and not just a few. If you look at some of the programs, such as Gear Up, and you will see that we are asking for an amount that will take us into the next funding level, so that they would be getting, what is that number, Chaka? Mr. Fattah. $495 million. Mr. Hinojosa. Yes, $495 million. Mr. Fattah. Right. Mr. Hinojosa. Again, I am not trying to exaggerate when I say that when you are only serving 38 percent of the children who are eligible in head start; when we are serving only a small number who qualify for Gear Up; when you take a look at the under-funding that has occurred in the last 10 years for HSIs, Hispanic Serving Institutions, where we were getting only $10 million in help, and we took that number from $10 million to $28 million, just think about this. There are 203 Hispanic Serving Institutions, and over three million Hispanic college students. So this is just to say that we have neglected many of these exemplary programs. All we are asking is that you take a good look at these programs, because they are the ones who are going to help our students graduate from high school, go on to colleges, and become professions. In fact, some of them may become Congressmen. Mr. Fattah. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. Mr. Regula. I think Henry Bonilla went through the Trio Program. Mr. Fattah. Yes. Mr. Regula. Is the state pulling its share? Mr. Hinojosa. We are challenging them, I guarantee you. We are challenging the State of Texas to do their share. Mr. Regula. Are there any questions? Mr. Sherwood. Mr. Sherwood. I would just like to suggest to the gentleman from Texas that he take good care of those two Congressional seats, because we might want them back some day. [Laughter.] Ms. Pelosi. Mr. Chairman, I would like to commend these two gentlemen. They have worked so hard on the education issues on their committee and with Mr. Fattah here on the Appropriations Committee. Mr. Hinjosa will do a lot for the economic development of his area on the Banking Committee, which has some important jurisdiction, down there for economic development. But when they talk about Gear Up, the work on the authorizing side is so important to us here, both for the Hispanic servicing institutions and the Historical Black colleges and universities, that have been such a tremendous resource to us. So for all of the K-12 preschool and the rest and higher education, thank you for making it, I do not want to say easier, but for helping our community give this such a high priority. I am pleased to work with you in these areas. Mr. Fattah. Thank you, Mr. Chairman, for giving us the time, and we look forward to working with you. I am sorry that I am off the House Education Committee. However, I am happy to be on the Appropriations Committee. Mr. Regula. I believe you made a worthwhile change. Next is Mr. Underwood from Guam. I used to see you in the Interior. ---------- Tuesday, March 27, 2001. CONGRESSIONAL ASIAN PACIFIC AMERICAN CAUCUS HEALTH CARE TASK FORCE WITNESS HON. BOB UNDERWOOD, A UNITED STATES DELEGATE FROM GUAM AND CHAIR, CONGRESSIONAL ASIAN PACIFIC AMERICAN CAUCUS HEALTH CARE TASK FORCE Mr. Underwood. Mr. Chairman, it is always a pleasure to appear in front of you, begging for more money in various capacities. Mr. Regula. And you are pretty good at it. [Laughter.] Mr. Underwood. Well, thank you, Mr. Chairman and members of the committee, for the opportunity to present the concerns of the Asian and Pacific Island Caucus on some major health issues concerns. You may already know, Mr. Chairman, that the Asian and Pacific Island is the most diverse ethical and racial group in the country, comprised of both immigrant populations and indigenous populations of Pacific Islanders. It also is the most heterogenous community. What you may not know is that Asian and Pacific Islander communities are severely hampered by a lack of accurate demographic data to monitor and enforce civil rights, laws, and ensure equal access to Federal programs, and in particular, health care. This lack of meaningful data makes it difficult to track health treads, identify problems areas and solutions, and enforce civil rights. This problem has been attempted to be resolved by the Office of Management and Budget back in 1997, when it made a significant change to the standards for maintaining, collecting and presenting Federal data on race and ethnicity. This chain separated Asians from Native Hawaiians and other Pacific Islanders, and allowed respondents to designate more than one racial ethnic category. We hope that this effort will provide more accurate data. In addition, to this particular issue, the 1990 Census also reported that about 35 percent of Asian and Pacific Islanders live in linguistically-isolated household, in which none of the individuals ages 14 or over spoke any English very well. In 1997, the Census reported the rate of persons with limited English proficiency grew to 40 percent for Asian and Pacific Islanders Americans, and over 60 percent for Southeast Asian Americans. The absence or severe lack of culturally and linguistically-assessable services leads to the gross under- utilization of health care services, misdiagnosis and treatment of disease, chronic illness and needless suffering. It also contributes to Asian and Pacific Islanders seeking treatment at a much later more progressed state of illness, which is not only costlier to treat, but is often preventable with earlier detection. Asian and Pacific Islanders are often mislabeled as the model minority with few health is social problems. This label is a myth and a gross myth representation of the community, which is very diverse. Within this population alone, there exits divergent social economic achievement rates, among euthenics and racial diverse cultures. Recent data from various institutions and Government agencies, including the Department of Heath and Human Services and the Census, revealed for example the following disparities. Compared to the total U.S. population, disproportionate numbers of minority Americans lack health insurance; about 24 percent of Asian and Pacific Islanders Americans. Asian and Pacific Islander Americans continue to experience the highest rate of tuberculosis and hepatitis B in this country. Approximately one half of all woman who give birth to Hepatitis B carrier infants in the U.S. were foreign-born Asian woman. Liver cancer, which is usually caused by exposure to Hepatitis B virus, disproportionately effects the Asian Americans. Filipinos have the second poorest five year survival rates for colon and rectal cancers of all U.S. ethnic groups. Cancer is reported as the leading cause of death in nearly all Pacific Island jurisdiction. In Guam, lung cancer accounts for one-third of all recorded deaths. Native Hawaiians have the second highest mortality rate in the National due to lung cancer. Cervical cancer is a significant problem in Korean and American women, and it affects Vietnamese American women at a rate five times higher than white women. Breast cancer incidents in Japanese American women is approaching that of white women. Moreover, some studies indicate that approximately 79 percent of Asian-born Asian American women have a greater proportion of tumors larger than one centimeter at diagnosis. Breast and cervical cancer rates for Marshallese Islander are five times and 75 times higher respectably for rates for all U.S. women. Native Hawaiian woman have the highest incidents of mortality rates of endometrial cancers of all U.S. woman. Diabetes affects tomorrow's indigenous people of Guam and Commonwealth of the northern Marianas Islands at five times the National average. Infant mortality rates in the U.S. insular areas of American Samoa, Guam and Siena more than double the National average. Finally, in my home island of Guam, there has been a recent and significant incidence of suicide, and particularly teen suicides, fostered by contacts through suicide packs over the Internet. Last week, the Guam Department of Mental Health and Substance reported that about 95 percent of the admissions into the children's unit of the Guam Memorial Hospital are related to suicide intentions. In response to all of this, we have listed five listed budgetary priorities, including a funding increase of $12 million additional for the Office of Minority Health and the Department of Health and Human Services for the REACH initiative in the Center for Disease Control. This is currently funded at $35 million. In fiscal year 2000, the CDC was able to fund only 32 grants, which works in collaboration with OMH and other appropriate Federal agencies, to intensify efforts to eliminate health disparities. However, a funding increase is requested to allow communities to apply for REACH initiative grants. For the National Center for Minority Health and Health Disparities in the NIH, we are asking again for additional funding for the minority ADIS initiative, which was funded in 2001 at $350 million, which is an increase of $100 million over fiscal year 2000. However, the 2001 funding fell short of the original funding request of approximately $540 million. Finally, in fiscal year 2001, SAMSA's minority fellowship program received nearly $2 million over the fiscal year level, for a total of $3 million. A $2 million increase is again requested for fiscal year 2002, to help address the critical needs to enhance the quality and effectiveness of the provision of health and mental health services to community of colors by increasing numbers of well- trained professionals. It is very critically important to understand that the context of the provision of health care services in minority communities is affected by cultural linguistic factors and the lack of, in many instances, trained personnel. I believe that it should be our strong commitment as a Nation to help bridge this gap for the provision of health services, so that we can reduce the disparities, some of which I have outlined here today. Again, I want to thank you, Mr. Chairman, as always. I do not know what other subcommittee you are going to go to next, but I always enjoy appearing in front of you. Thank you very much. [The information follows:] [GRAPHIC(S) NOT AVAILABLE IN TIFF FORMAT] Mr. Regula. I am sure you will have a request, whatever subcommittee it is. [Laughter.] Mr. Rodriguez. ---------- Tuesday, March 27, 2001. CONGRESSIONAL HISPANIC CAUCUS HEALTH CARE TASK FORCE WITNESS HON. CIRO RODRIGUEZ, A REPRESENTATIVE IN CONGRESS FROM THE STATE OF TEXAS AND CHAIR, CONGRESSIONAL HISPANIC CAUCUS HEALTH CARE TASK FORCE Mr. Rodriguez. Mr. Chairman, let me first of all apologize for being a little bit late. As the Chairman of the Hispanic Caucus and member of the VA committee, we had an opportunity to provide some testimony on health, and you will have an opportunity to vote on those bills this afternoon on the VA, which is also very critical for a lot of Hispanic veterans that are out there. But I want to thank you for allowing us the opportunity, as Chairman of the Task Force on Health with the Hispanic Caucus, that has 18 members of the 21 Hispanic members of the Congress, to be here before you. Hispanics continue to experiences barriers in the areas of health care insurance. I want to briefly just mention to you that out of 44 million uninsured Americans in this country, one-quarter of those, or 11 million, are Hispanics. These are individuals that are working. In fact, out of those 11 million that are Hispanics that are uninsured, 9 million are working individuals, that despite the fact that in this country, if you are working for a small company, if you are not working for a major corporation, if you are not working for Government, you do not have access to insurance. Yet, you are not poor enough to qualify for Medicaid; you are not old enough to qualify for Medicare; and you find yourself without any access to insurance. So the importance of the CHIPS Program is critical, and so we want to be supportive of those efforts and encourage the importance of continuing to fund those efforts in that area. The importance of access to health care is one of the things that is lacking in the Hispanic community, and one of the areas that impacts us the most. To address the growing problems, and one which is a negative impact on local health disparities in our local communities, it is important that we continue to move forward in those efforts. Our community health centers that provide a vital safety net for Hispanics and other minorities throughout this country need to continue to be funded. Seventy percent of those served by the community health centers are minority. Sixty-six percent of them live in poverty. The request from our efforts, from the Hispanic Caucus, is that we fund them at $250 million above the current funding levels for the community health centers. President Bush has promised to provide $3.6 billion, over five years, to build additional 1,200 community health centers. We request a $250 million increase. It would put us on the right track to meet the President's needs in this specific area. So we ask for your serious consideration. Hispanics also account for 20 percent of the new AIDS cases. As we look at the issue of AIDS, we see the new data that is there and it looks like we are making some inroads but despite, it is hitting disproporionately a lot of the low income areas. Despite the fact that Hispanics represent 12.5 percent of the population, we represent 20 percent of HIV cases. So we ask for your help and your support in that specific area and request full funding at the level of $539.4 million for year 2002 for the Minority AIDS Initiative to promote capacity building for minority-based organizations. The U.S. Census 2000 shows that Hispanics make up 12.5 percent as I indicated. One of the basic ways of dealing with AIDS is to make sure we have those community-based programs. With the Hispanic community, we have not been able to organize those. We have been lagging behind in resources to fight the issue of AIDS and we need those resources to make sure we establish those community-based organizations to reach out to those pockets that are out there. In the area of diabetes, it strikes Hispanics--especially Mexican Americans and Puerto Ricans--at a disproportionate rate. In addition, growing evidence shows that Type II diabetes and adult onset diabetes increasingly strikes Hispanic children. We are learning more about the relationships. The beauty of this is we have a lot of new research where we can identify those specific areas with young people, with children. We have been able to identify a large number, but now we have to do something about that. We need to move forward. We ask for increased support of $100 million for Hispanic focus on diabetes prevention and treatment. These activities include targeting geographic areas throughout this country that need to be targeted. It doesn't do any good to identify those kids--we are doing it--and not do anything about it. Part of that is the education that goes along with that. So we ask for your help, assistance and your efforts. In the area of mental health and substance abuse, one of the areas that we have neglected as a country and where people have fallen through the cracks, as indicated earlier by my friend, is we are finding a lot of young people. When they first came to tell me we were having a large number of suicides among young ladies of Mexican-American descent, I told them I don't believe it, show me the research. Sure enough, they came to me and it is startling to see the rates of suicides among young Hispanics as well as alcohol and drug abuse. So it becomes important that we look at that area of mental health and substance abuse, and that we provide some resources. President Bush's budget includes an initiative to double NIH funds for 2003. While the Hispanic caucus supports increasing research funding levels, it is important to find ways to encourage Hispanic focused research. The key is toalso look at specific research that targets Hispanic populations with a clear understanding that with what we face, we can then deliver culturally competence. There is example after example and one example that comes to me, which I have been sharing, when we talk about competency and culturally relevant, when this person was told she was positive. When you tell them in positive, then you think everything is okay and sure enough this person later on had a child and contracted AIDS. So there is a need and we should not take things for granted. We need to reach out and make sure people understand, especially when we deal with issues of mental health and the competency and cultural relevancy of reaching out to those individuals. We had another case of mental health with a person in a State hospital in San Antonio who would go out and walk and walk, walk and stop, walk and stop and walk and stop and people would try to stop her. She would get angry and throw a fit. She was actually doing her rosary. She would walk so many steps and would stop and keep on. People didn't understand that. It is important to recognize the importance of cultural competency, language proficiency and what it means. We are going to ask for some funding in that specific area of $3 million. If you want specifics on the funding, I would look forward to meeting with you to provide some of those statistics. The budget also proposes reduced funding to the health professionals which provide training grants to institutions to increase the number of under represented health professions. This is a serious mistake. Right now, every agency in the Federal Government is expecting to retire one-third of our people. We were just told in the GAO report on the military that of 50 percent, 65,000 employees, we are going to retire 32,000 of them, almost half. There is a need for us to invest in apprenticeships. It is important for us to invest in those individuals and make sure that we have good quality professionals. In the area of access to health care, there is a nursing shortage in this country and this is not the time to cut back on these programs. The budget estimates of $125 million for community access programs provides grants to communities, hospital and community health centers that serve uninsured youngsters and is key. Please look at that funding, especially in terms of the apprenticeship programs and providing the health professions the assistance that is needed. We need to go beyond that. We need to make sure we have those qualified professionals out there, those individuals that can be culturally competent and have access to the training that is important and needed. According to the Department of Health and Human Services, there are 3,000 medically under served communities. So we need these grants. Thank you for the time and the opportunity to address the subcommittee on the Congressional Hispanic Caucus priorities and we look forward to working with you. [The information follows:] [GRAPHIC(S) NOT AVAILABLE IN TIFF FORMAT] Mr. Regula. The community health centers have served a very worthwhile role and I hope we can increase those because I think it catches a lot of people who are uninsured and probably not able to get medical care. Mr. Rodriguez. Yes, sir. In fact, 67 percent are uninsured in that category and 70 percent are minority. Mr. Regula. Questions? Ms. Pelosi. I want to thank the two gentlemen for their excellent testimony and Mr. Underwood for his leadership in the Asian Pacific Islander Caucus and Mr. Rodriguez who has been working on this for such a long time. Last year, he was able to get $1.7 million for minority health research and outreach. We are hoping that money will be coming very soon to help in getting a handle on what these needs are. I wanted to bring Congresswoman Christensen in on this as well. As you testified earlier, we are blessed that the former Chair of the Interior Committee is now in the Health seat because he understands the needs of the territories better than anyone. Mr. Regula. I have had a lot of assistance from Mr. Underwood. Thank you both for your interest. Our next witness is Ms. Ros-Lehtinen from Florida. ---------- Tuesday, March 27, 2001. CLOSE UP FOUNDATION WITNESS HON. ILEANA ROS-LEHTINEN, A REPRESENTATIVE IN CONGRESS FROM THE STATE OF FLORIDA Ms. Ros-Lehtinen. We are so thankful to have such a strong organization nationally and in all of our districts. Thank you, Mr. Chairman and members of the subcommittee. We are pleased to submit my testimony in support of the Close Up Foundation's Allen J. Ellender Fellowship Program. During my time in Congress, I have been a strong supporter of Close Up and its civic education programs. As a former educator, I believe the Close Up Foundation Civic Education Program is a valuable weapon in our arsenal to combat disaffection with government among our young people. The Allen J. Ellender Fellowships are vital in reaching out to a diverse group of young people, specifically those in need of financial assistance so that we can enable them to participate in Close Up's unique civic education program. Without the Ellender Fellowship Program, the Close Up Foundation would be unable to reach students who are perhaps more in need of having their importance to our democracy validated. The only criterion for a student to receive an Ellender Fellowship is an income eligibility requirement and student recipients of these fellowships are among the neediest students in our educational system. Impressively, the overwhelming majority of Ellender Fellowship recipients participate in local fundraising activities throughout the year to cover the full cost of the program. The foundation also has special programs to reach students who are recent immigrants to the United States. As a member from Florida, one of the most culturally diverse States in our Nation, I can personally attest to the growing positive influence that these immigrants have had upon the cultural fabric of our Nation and the great contributions that they make every day to our country. They too need to be educated about their adopted homeland and specifically about how our government and our democratic form of government works. Close Up also outreaches to students in our rural towns and urban communities who are beneficiaries of Ellender Fellowship assistance. I understand the subcommittee faces an extremely difficult task in trying to prioritize what programs to fund and at what levels, but I ask you to consider the grave need for civil education programs, and particularly for programs that reach our disadvantaged youth. The Close Up Foundation uses the relatively small appropriations that it receives for the Ellender Fellowship Program as seed money around which educators and students expand their local Close Up programs. I ask that the subcommittee demonstrate its support for Close Up's civic education program by not only maintaining the current $1.5 million funding level for the Allen J. Ellender Fellowship Program but by increasing the funding level. This would send an important signal that we in Congress believe that citizenship education is as important to being a well-rounded individual as knowing math, science and literature. It would be a great investment in the strength and well being of our democracy. I thank the Chairman and I thank the members and the staff. [The information follows:] [GRAPHIC(S) NOT AVAILABLE IN TIFF FORMAT] Mr. Regula. Do you think these young people go back home and take the message of things they learn here in the Close Up Program back to their colleagues? Ms. Ros-Lehtinen. I think so. At least that has been the case in our district office. We encourage them to participate, they come to our district office, put in their time there as well, and go back to their areas, whether they are working in Washington or in the district office and really make it work. They demonstrate that this is a great country where we are given all kinds of opportunities. I thank you for funding it and we hope to be there with even a little more this year. Mr. Regula. Next we have a panel of Mr. Hayworth and Mr. Edward on Impact Aid. We heard from some of our colleagues earlier making a pretty powerful case. I will let Mr. Sherwood take this one. Mr. Sherwood [assuming chair]. Gentlemen. ---------- Tuesday, March 27, 2001. IMPACT AID WITNESS HON. J.D. HAYWORTH, A REPRESENTATIVE IN CONGRESS FROM THE STATE OF ARIZONA Mr. Hayworth. Let me thank the gentleman from Pennsylvania. It is good to see him in the Chair but my joy at seeing him there is eclipsed by the temporary departure of the full Chairman of the Subcommittee who is all too aware of the challenges we confront. I would note for the record that a number of my constituents join me in this chamber here today for this testimony who could offer very eloquent testimony as to just how important this program is. On behalf of all the members of the Impact Aid Coalition, I want to thank you and members of the subcommittee for affording us this opportunity to address what we consider to be a very, very important issue, an issue of critical importance, impact aid. Impact aid is a Federal education program that provides funding to more than 1,500 school districts connected in some way to the Federal Government, whether by an Indian reservation, a military installation, or the designation of Federal land. Traditionally, property sales and personal income taxes account for a large portion of the average school district's annual budget but impact aid schools educate students whose parents may live on nontaxable Federal property, shop at stores that do not generate taxes, work on nontaxable Federal land, or do not pay taxes in their States of residence. School districts could also receive impact aid if some or all of their property was taken off the tax rolls by the Federal Government. As one of the Co-Chairs of the Impact Aid Coalition, I am honored to be here to fight for this important program and I am so pleased the gentleman from Texas, Mr. Edwards, joins me in this endeavor. The Coalition will be sending you a letter requesting your support for its goals of securing $1.19 billion in funding for the Impact Aid Program for fiscal year 2002. While this is an increase of approximately 19 percent over last year's funding level, Mr. Chairman, it is important to note that the amount the Federal Government actually owes impact aid schools for basic support and Federal property payments is more than $2 billion. Increasing impact aid funding to $1.19 billion will be an important step toward fully funding this program which currently receives less than half of its authorized funding. As you may know, the Sixth District of Arizona, which I am honored to represent, is the most federally impacted congressional district in the country. My district alone receives nearly $100 million in impact aid funds. Without these funds, thousands of my young constituents would simply not be educated, constituents who join me today in this hearing room. My district is unique because it has the largest Native American population in the 48 contiguous States, nearly 1 out of every 4 of my constituents is a Native American.Approximately 50 percent of the land mass in my district is tribal land. Many Native American reservations face staggering unemployment rates and other devastating economic conditions. For many children on these reservations, education is their only hope to escape a life of poverty. I am sure you are aware of the Federal Government's treaty obligations to our sovereign Indian tribes and nations. Part of these obligations includes educating these children. It was part of the treaty trust obligation. Without impact aid, the Federal Government cannot live up to those aforementioned treaty obligations. Therefore, I wholeheartedly support the Coalition's goal of securing $1.19 billion for this important program. You know that I am ever critical of wasteful and unnecessary government bureaucracy. Therefore, I am particularly pleased to support impact aid as funds in this program are provided directly to the local school districts for general operating expenses. The use of impact aid funds is determined by locally elected school boards. As you know, the money appropriated by Congress is sent by electronic financial transaction directly to the financial institution of the eligible school district. There is no administrative cost associated with the program. I am also a strong critic of wasteful spending and the inappropriate use of Federal tax dollars that is seen from time to time here in our Nation's Capitol. I am completely committed to maintaining a balanced budget. However, because impact aid services military families and Indian tribes, my colleagues understand this full well. It is an unequivocal Federal responsibility. Through a robust impact aid program, we can demonstrate our commitment to those children who would otherwise be shut out from most educational opportunities. By funding impact aid, at $1.19 billion for fiscal year 2001, we can fulfill our responsibility of providing these educational opportunities to each of our Nation's students. Again, thank you, Mr. Chairman, and members of the subcommittee for inviting members of the Impact Aid Coalition here today to voice our opinions, to be joined by our constituents. I would be happy to remain here to answer any questions you might have. Thank you very much. [The information follows:] [GRAPHIC(S) NOT AVAILABLE IN TIFF FORMAT] Mr. Sherwood. Thank you very much. Now we will hear from the gentleman from Texas. ---------- Tuesday, March 27, 2001. WITNESS HON. CHET EDWARDS, A REPRESENTATIVE IN CONGRESS FROM THE STATE OF TEXAS, ON BEHALF OF THE IMPACT AID PANEL Mr. Edwards. It is an honor for me to join my colleague, J.D., to speak on behalf of the bipartisan 127 House member Impact Aid Coalition. To most Americans, the term impact aid may not mean anything but to 13 million American children, it means the difference between receiving a quality education and a mediocre or poor education. With the Chairman's approval, I would like to submit my written testimony and would like to do something a bit different if I could, and then give back some of my five minutes of time. I would like to put a human face on the statistics behind those 13 million Americans impacted directly by this education program. This comes from a Washington Post article of March 14, a story of one military family. Let me read several excerpts. The first is a letter from an Army Soldier, Randy Roddy who was in Saudi Arabia at the time his son was about to have his second birthday. This is what he wrote to that son. ``As your second birthday rolls around and it is apparent that we will not be able to spend it together, I find it important to write you and tell you some things you need to know. Someday perhaps you will be able to pull out this letter and comprehend.'' He then goes on to say, ``I must start by telling you how proud I am to have you as my son. You never cease to amaze me when I see you on a video cassette. Because of events in this world of ours that are bigger than either you or me, I have not been able to share these last five months with you.'' The article goes on to talk about Mr. Roddy's spouse. It said, meanwhile at Ft. Bliss in the Texas desert, Lisa had her own struggles raising their child, working a receptionist job to supplement their pay, soothing the fragile emotions of several dozen wives whose husbands served in Randy's command. ``They look to me,'' she said, ``as a troop commander's wife. I helped deliver two babies, I helped when someone's car was repossessed. One wife tried to kill herself and her three children and called me.'' The articles goes on and says, ``You don't just join the Army, the whole family does.'' It talks about Mr. Roddy's four-year-old child, a little girl, who lost all of her hair because of being distraught when her father was deployed to Korea on a company tour for a year. The reason I mention the story of the Roddy family is it is clear we underpay our military soldiers and their families, all of our troops from all services. It is clear to our Military Construction Subcommittee that 60 percent of our military families live in housing that does not meet basic DOD standards. The reason I mention that is it seems to me if we can't pay our military soldiers and their families what they deserve, if we ask them to live in substandard housing, if we ask their families to spend month upon month away from loved ones serving our country, risking their lives for you, me and our families, the very least we should do as a country for these families is to say to them while you are serving your country and risking your life, we are going to ensure that your children will receive a quality education. I think the story of the Roddy family tells the story of the importance of impact aid. Whether it is Native American children or children of military families, amidst the many important competing priorities that you must set, I hope this subcommittee would once again remember the importance of funding adequately the Impact Aid Program. I would like to look at Mrs. Roddy who will be before our Military Construction Subcommittee in a few weeks and say, despite all of the difficulties and perhaps some of the things we ask you to sacrifice, we will see that your children receive a quality education. That has happened in the past, Mr. Chairman, because of the members of this subcommittee and we respectfully ask, on behalf of the Coalition and these 13 million children for whom we speak, that you please continue that leadership effort and support fully funding for impact aid. [The information follows:] [GRAPHIC(S) NOT AVAILABLE IN TIFF FORMAT] Mr. Sherwood. Thank you both very much for your exceptional and compelling testimony. Two years ago at a readiness hearing in Italy with our distinguished late chairman of the Readiness Committee, Mr. Bateman, I was talking with some military personnel there and made almost the same statement you did. When our brave young men and women are defending us around the world, the least we can do is see there is a good education for their children. In all these areas where the Federal Government, by treaty or law, has denied these school districts of revenue that would normally be there, we have to step up to the plate, so we will take a strong look at it. Mr. Hayworth. One note. We should point out that though my friend from Texas concentrated on military dependents and I talked about some of the challenges facing tribes, these concerns are not mutually exclusive. If you take a look at those who answer the call to military service, tribal members, Native Americans, more than any other group, answer the call to military service. So there is a connected interrelationship here. I would appreciate the committee taking that into account. I commend my friend from Texas for very eloquent testimony about what is faced by military dependents. You can see on the faces of my constituents here and they could offer very profound testimony from their real life experience. I appreciate your hearing us and the Chair's indulgence for this time this afternoon. Mr. Sherwood. The gentleman from New York, Mr. Fossella. ---------- Tuesday, March 27, 2001. JUVENILE DIABETES RESEARCH WITNESS HON. VITO J. FOSSELLA, A REPRESENTATIVE IN CONGRESS FROM THE STATE OF NEW YORK Mr. Fossella. Thank you for providing me the opportunity to testify today. I would like to thank you and this committee for continuing the effort to double the budget of the National Institute of Health by the year 2003. Since being elected to Congress, I have been a strong supporter of meaningful funding for the National Institute of Health, and I applaud the President's recent announcement that he will seek increased funding for life-saving medical research at the NIH. I would pause to thank publicly all those dedicated professionals employed by the NIH and all health care professionals publicly and privately who dedicate their lives to try to improve the human condition. Politics is a lot of things to a lot of people but one thing we can agree upon is that we can all work together to improve the human condition. We have seen it time and time again where illnesses we thought could never be solved have led individuals to lead better lives. As far as I am concerned, our best days are ahead. Of special concern to me is meaningful funding for the National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases for fiscal year 2002. Finding a cure for Type I diabetes is absolutely doable and with congressional support, it will happen. No one in my parents' generation ever imagined a human being would travel in space, let alone land on the moon but on May 25, 1961, President Kennedy stood before a joint session of Congress to declare it ``time for a great new American enterprise.'' Then in 1969, what seemed impossible became reality. I believe we are now in a time of a great American enterprise, a time when we are closer than ever before to not only helping the millions who currently suffer from the insidious condition of diabetes but laying the foundation for future generations to live their lives free of this disease. It is not just a health issue, it happens to be an economic one as well. Diabetes happens to be a very costly disease to our Nation and accounts for approximately $105 billion in direct and indirect health care costs. One out of ten health care dollars overall are spent on individuals with this disease. I understand the World Health Organization estimates there are 125 million people worldwide with diabetes. This number has increased 15 percent in the last 10 years and is actually expected to double by the year 2005. In the U.S., the CDC refers to diabetes as ``a major public health threat of epidemic proportions.'' Ten million people in our Nation have already been diagnosed with diabetes while an estimated 6 million have diabetes but are undiagnosed. To put that in prospective, onaverage, there is an estimated 23,000 people diagnosed and another 14,000 undiagnosed in every congressional district across the country. More important than the costs are the lives this disease takes. Each year, 193,000 people die from complications from this disease. That is one every three minutes. Clearly a cure must be found and I believe it will be. Great and promising strides have recently been made in funding a cure for Type I diabetes. The contributions must continue and with your assistance, I am confident a cure will be discovered during our lifetime. Researchers are collaborating on many new treatments and others on the identification of the genetic components of diabetes. One of these promising treatments is known as the Edmonton Protocol for Eyelet Cell Transplantation. This is a process where insulin-producing cells called eyelet cells are removed from the pancreas and transplanted to a diabetic patient. The success rate has been extremely encouraging. The researchers in Edmonton, Canada have announced they were successful in transplanting the insulin producing eyelet cells into a number of men and women with Type I diabetes resulting in the discontinued use of insulin injections which is the scourge of millions who suffer from it. To date, more than 16 men and women have received this transplant and 100 percent remain off insulin entirely. Researchers are further studying this transplantation without the need of the dreaded immunosuppressant drugs. The Edmonton Protocol has given the diabetic community great hope for a cure. Clinical trials of this extraordinary transplantation will be taking place and are taking place here in the United States. The procedure may not be helpful to children because it requires the use of the immunosuppressant drugs I mentioned before. Children's fragile bodies simply cannot withstand these very strong drugs. It is my hope that continued research with your support and members of this committee and indeed all of Congress, will soon enable more adults and even children to utilize eyelet transplantation. Our support is crucial to capitalize on the success of eyelet cell transplantation and to shorten the timeline to cure that we know is within our grasp. Mr. Chairman, you have been a leading advocate in this in playing an important role in encouraging increased research of diabetes and particularly Type I diabetes. Last year, Congress and the White House approved a 60 percent increase, the largest ever in juvenile diabetes research funding at the NIH. This increased funding will allow researchers to explore new opportunities to cure diabetes. It is my hope that Congress remains committed to helping to find a cure for diabetes. The time is now, the cure is within our grasp. It is not just the individuals, it is the families that are affected adversely, the 18-month-olds, the two-year- olds that have to live and forever live until a cure is found with the six to eight times a day of pin pricks and two, three and four injections. All we would like to do is help them live a normal and healthy life. [The information follows:] [GRAPHIC(S) NOT AVAILABLE IN TIFF FORMAT] Mr. Regula [resuming chair]. I understand. I have had some families from my district visit with me and I know the difficulty it creates for everyone involved. We do hope we can get a cure. It would be a wonderful thing to get a breakthrough on that. I know NIH is pursuing research very aggressively, especially using cell process as you described. That would be a wonderful thing if we could. We will do all we can. Mr. Fossella. Thank you, sir. Mr. Regula. Mr. Wu, you get the honor of being the last one today. ---------- Tuesday, March 27, 2001. PROJECTS WITNESS HON. DAVID WU, A REPRESENTATIVE IN CONGRESS FROM THE STATE OF OREGON Mr. Wu. Thank you. I thank you for the opportunity to testify before the subcommittee today. As you prepare the fiscal year 2002 appropriations bills, I would like to bring to your attention several projects from my congressional district that I think are worthy of national attention. I am seeking $2.5 million from the Fund for the improvement of post-secondary education to support the Mark O. Hatfield School of Government at Portland State University. It is named in honor of Oregon's most prominent and distinguished national leaders and has been a solid academic center for the advancement of education and research about public service. The money will be used to fund faculty and staff and support students at the school and the various research institutions such as the Institute for Tribal Government which the larger committee helped fund last year. Among the activities that will be funded is advanced education for elected and appointed officials at all levels of government, including those at non-profit organizations and other public institutions. In addition, funds will be used to increase the awareness of the importance of public service and to foster among young Americans greater recognition of the role of public service in the development of United States and to promote public service as a career choice. There is an extensive history of Federal funding for the Hatfield School of Government. Congress approved funding for the school in fiscal year 1999 and 2000 and last year as I noted funding was approved for the Institute of Tribal Government, an institution unique in the 50 States to study and support tribal governments. The second project I would like to mention briefly is a million dollar request from the Fund for the Improvement of Education for the Portland Metropolitan Partnership. We talk a lot about improving primary and secondary teaching but without strong leadership from the top, I don't believe that progress is possible. This program at Portland State University is aimed at providing that kind of leadership within schools. Third, I am seeking $2 million from the Administration on Aging for Oregon Health Sciences University for the second phase of the Center for Healthy Aging. The subcommittee supported the first phase of this project with a $1 million appropriation in fiscal year 2000. This demonstration project promotes health and prolonged independence by coaching participants and connecting them with resources to bring about positive changes in health behaviors and status. Here I would like to go off the written track a bit by mentioning that Oregon is among that handful of States thathas really innovated in helping older Americans achieve and maintain independence for longer periods of time. This not only gives older Americans their choice of lifestyles because I think many would prefer to stay as independent as long as possible, but in addition, it helps save the Federal Government money because if we don't have to institutionalize people, it is a significant savings. The Center on Health Aging's purpose is disseminate a clinical model which works both for older Americans and for our public purse. It is a worthwhile project this committee has seen fit to fund in the past. About two weeks ago, this subcommittee heard from Dr. Grover Bagby, the Director of the Oregon Cancer Center at OHSU. Dr. Bagby addressed the growing shortage of nurses faced by academic as well as rural health centers. The baby boom generation has provided its share of nurses and as a result, we will be facing large scale retirements soon. OHSU is expecting that 45 percent of the nursing faculty will retire within four years and because of this, we are attempting to alleviate the nursing shortage through the Laboratory for Teaching Technology application and innovation in nursing at OHSU. I am requesting $1.9 million from the Health Resources and Services Administration, Rural Health Outreach Grant Account. Without the teaching nurses at OHSU, we do not expect to be able to get nurses into the rural parts of the State nearly as effectively as we otherwise could. Finally, I hope you will be able to support a small portion of the Columbia River Estuary Research Program through the Fund for the Improvement of Post Secondary Education. We are seeking funding to train scientists, students and faculty for this program. Last year, the subcommittee supported the program through an appropriation to establish certificate and graduate degree programs in environmental information technology. We are seeking to continue that programmatic development and training. I might add I became familiar with this program several years ago as a private citizen. It is an amazing public/private partnership where this research institution has basically gone to the mouth of the Columbia River, one of the major estuaries of the U.S. west or anywhere in America, and by studying the currents, studying temperature, salinity, water density and flows, by being able to predict where things wind up, these folks are better able to help ships navigate the Columbia River, help salmon smelts navigate downstream to get out to the ocean, help predict where pollutants will wind up. There is an obvious hardware component of this program but there is a very important human and training component to this program. That is where we are seeking help from this subcommittee. It is a well leveraged and well worthwhile program. I thank the committee for its attention to these programs of importance to Oregon and am ready to answer any questions you may have. [The information follows:] [GRAPHIC(S) NOT AVAILABLE IN TIFF FORMAT] Mr. Regula. Thank you. Sounds like you have some interesting projects. Is the School of Government at Portland something like what they have at Harvard with the Kennedy School? Mr. Wu. In essence, it is our northwest version of the Kennedy School, yes, or the midwest version of the Hubert Humphrey School or the LBJ School. Mr. Regula. The aging project sounds interesting. You are trying to help older people stay independent for a longer period of time? Mr. Wu. That is an important goal. Perhaps that is a primary goal along with helping them to stay healthier longer. Mr. Regula. That goes along with it. You can't be independent if you are not healthy. Mr. Wu. That is right. And at a fixed health status, if you will. We want to help people stay healthier but at one fixed health status, if you are able to coach the individual and also bring together community resources to focus on the individual, if the individual can reach out to the resources and bring community resources to bear, at the same health status that person might be tempted to go into an institution whereas if you bring the services together in the right way and empower the individual. Mr. Regula. You make the community more friendly to independence? Mr. Wu. Yes. Mr. Regula. Do you involve the family? A lot of times this would take education of families for support members. Does the program involve family members too? Mr. Wu. Absolutely. In this program there is a very strong educational component for the family and I should say outside of this program in the general model, there is the availability for some State funding of family members so that family members can take more time away from other things and be more appropriate and more effective caregivers to fellow family members. Mr. Regula. Sounds like a very worthwhile program. Mr. Wu. It is something that had a bit of room to run in a few other States and no where has it gone as far as it has especially in the Klamath Valley part of the State of Oregon. If we can make this model effective and try to replicate it elsewhere, I have heard academicians from around the country discuss how this would make people happier by keeping them independent but be a major cost savings to the Federal Government. Mr. Regula. I think that is absolutely right on both counts. Do you have Klamath Valley? Mr. Wu. No, I do not. It is Mr. Walden's good fortune to have the Klamath Basin. Mr. Regula. It would be further east. Mr. Wu. A bit to the east and to the south. Mr. Regula. Do you have the city? Mr. Wu. Most of my congressional district is rural but I also have the urban core of Portland, the financial district, the most urban parts of Portland through the high tech suburbs but two-thirds or three-quarters of my congressional district is actually forestland or agricultural land. Mr. Regula. What corps or cattle? Mr. Wu. Not much in the way of cattle but we have a lot of orchards, a lot of nursery stock as it became too costly to run nurseries in southern California, a lot of the nursery folks came up to my neck of the woods, and hazelnuts or filberts as we prefer to call them in the northwest and I think some of the best wines in America. Mr. Regula. You must have a somewhat temperature climate there? Mr. Wu. Yes. It is a temperate climate more like the Mendocino coast or the burgundy kind of climates in Europe. We are so far north that our vinters have the challenge of highly variable growing seasons. That creates both the best of times and the worst of times as agriculture tends to do. Mr. Regula. Thank you for coming. The committee is adjourned until 10:00 a.m. tomorrow. Tuesday, April 3, 2001. McKINNEY EDUCATION FOR HOMELESS CHILDREN AND YOUTH WITNESS HON. JUDY BIGGERT, A REPRESENTATIVE IN CONGRESS FROM THE STATE OF ILLINOIS Mr. Regula. I call the committee to order. We have four panelists. You are not the ones that were scheduled for Panel 1, but we have four of you, so I am just going to go ahead and then as the others come in, we will use them on Panel 2 or Panel 3. I would be interested to hear what you have to say, and I know these are tough issues. We will start out with you Mrs. Biggert. Try to stick to 5 minutes, if possible. Mrs. Biggert. Thank you, Mr. Chairman and distinguished members of the subcommittee, who aren't here, but I will say hello to them anyway. Mr. Regula. This is not unusual. That is why I get the extra pay. Mrs. Biggert. I am sure they will join you as time goes on. As the Republican cochair for the Congressional Women's Caucus, I am pleased to have the opportunity for our members to testify today. Every year this forum has provided the caucus an opportunity to come together as a bipartisan group to discuss issues affecting women throughout the United States. And I would like to thank you again for extending us the opportunity for this year. Today I would like to express any support for the McKinney Education for Homeless Children and Youth, the EHCY program, and I respectfully request the subcommittee to appropriate $70,000,000 for this program in fiscal year 2002. Children represent one of the fastest growing segments of the homeless population. In fact, an estimated 1,000,000 children and youth will experience homelessness this year, a situation that will have devastating impact on their educational advancement. Because of their unstable situation, these children face significant hurdles in obtaining an education. Studies show that homeless children have four times the rate of delayed development, are twice as likely to repeat a grade, and are more susceptible to homelessness as adults. EHCY removes these obstacles to education for homeless children and has made a real difference in the lives of many children and families. Yet, appropriations for the McKinney Education Program, the only Federal education program targeted to these children, have not kept up with demand for services or inflation. Despite the increase in homelessness, Congress did not increase the funding for this program at all from 1995 until 2000. When Congress did finally increase the funding in 2001, it appropriated $35,000,000 for the program an increase of just $6,200,000. The lack of adequate funding for this program has been a major barrier to educating homeless children and youth. According to a recent national survey, in 1997 States were only able to serve 37 percent of school-aged children identified to be in this difficult situation. Compounding the problem is the poor collection of data on homeless children. States often do not have the resources to conduct the necessary assessments, and the lack of a uniform method of data collection has resulted in unreliable national data and the possible underreporting of homeless children. Earlier this month the subcommittee heard testimony from Lois Ferguson on behalf of the National Coalition for the Homeless. She gave emotional testimony about her experiences with homelessness and how the EHCY program had benefited her family. EHCY can make a real difference in many more lives, but only if the funding is there. I understand and appreciate the enormous budget constraints under which this subcommittee is working. However, I believe there is no better time than now to renew and strengthen Congress' financial commitment to helping provide homeless children with access to a quality education. I ask that you match the $70,000,000 that the Senate Health, Education, Labor, and Pensions Committee has recommended for the program in fiscal year 2002. By doing so, you will be reaching out to homeless children, helping to ensure that they don't lose out on what is guaranteed for all our children, a free public education. You also will be meeting President Bush's call to leave no child behind. Thank you very much for allowing me to testify today. [The information follows:] [GRAPHIC(S) NOT AVAILABLE IN TIFF FORMAT] Mr. Regula. Do you think the faith-based, if that program does develop, would be one group that might offer some services for these children? Mrs. Biggert. I think that is one way to address it. But what really concerns me is getting them back into a school system immediately and no red tape. And I think that the amount of money to do that, to have help financially for the ombudsman, and then the awareness that they know they can go to a school right away. And spreading $70,000,000 even over 50 States doesn't go very far. Mr. Regula. I notice you are close to Chicago. They have had some enlightened programs in their school system. Has the Chicago system done anything innovative in providing these services? Mrs. Biggert. What we did in Illinois--and, in fact, I have introduced the homeless education bill, which is in the reauthorization of the K-through-12 program, and that is the model that we use for that program. So Illinois has a very great model for all the States in the education of children, and it is working very well there. And even, in fact, just a couple of weeks ago one of my schools, you would not think would have homeless children in it, it really worked out a program for a couple of kids that were homeless and didn't know where to go were enrolled in school; and they had the ombudsman that was provided in this program. So it really is working there. It was brought to my attention from other States, saying why can't we have the same kind of program. Mr. Regula. I guess it takes local initiative, because we had $35,000,000 last year, which obviously is not enough. Mrs. Biggert. Well, you know, for the homeless centers just to be able to provide not only for education, but to be able to provide for all the homeless and particularly the children. Mr. Regula. I am sure it is a severe problem. ---------- Tuesday, April 3, 2001. THE WELLNESS OF WOMEN WITNESS HON. JUANITA MILLENDER-McDONALD, A REPRESENTATIVE IN CONGRESS FROM THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA Mr. Regula. Mrs. McDonald. Ms. Millender-McDonald. Thank you, Mr. Chairman, and good morning to you. Mr. Chairman, as the co-chair of the Women's Caucus, I am proud to come this morning. And we thank you for the opportunity to come before you this morning to again lay out our agenda for women and women's health. I am proud to have the women who have come this morning as a strong showing of advocacy for women across this country, especially the women who know of the myriad of health issues and problems that we see. I have testified in the past, Mr. Chairman, before you and others, on the need for us to look at the National Bone Marrow Program, telemedicine, breast, cervical, and lung cancers, fibroid tumors and other critical health issues. I was very pleased and very happy to have sat in the audience when the President mentioned his increase in funding in his budget for NIH. I respectfully request then that the 16.5 percent that the NIH is requesting for the various outlines of health issues that I will talk to this morning really be put in the budget, that is, $3,400,000,000 for NIH so that we can see some improvement in women's health. We have chosen for our theme this 107th Congress ``The Wellness of Women,'' and we certainly want, in our efforts and others' efforts, to promote and preserve women's health. As you know, heart disease is the number one killer for American women. Studies suggest that women are more likely than men to die from a heart attack, and women who recover from a heart attack are more likely than men to have a stroke or another heart attack. In fact, 44 percent of women die within a year following a heart attack compared to 27 percent of men. CDC is asking for $50 million to expand community education programs in 35 States for cardiovascular health programs. Another illness, Mr. Chairman, is that of cancer. It is the second leading killer of American women claiming 43,900 women in 1997. So early detection coupled with improved treatments has led to a decline in breast cancer rates, as well as cervical cancer, if women do get Pap smear tests. However, lung cancer has become the number one killer for women in terms of cancer in the cancer category, so we are asking, as well as the CDC, for the National Breast, Cervical, and Lung Cancer the Early Detection Program in the amount of $210,000,000 so that we can try to grapple with this whole notion of women and lung cancer, as well as cervical and breast cancers. Another disease that is really crippling women is that of lupus. Lupus affects one out of every 185 Americans. Although lupus can occur at any age and in either sex, 90percent of the victims with lupus are women. During the child-bearing years, lupus strikes women 10 to 15 times more frequently than men. And so we are asking for again, the NIH appropriation for lupus at $55,200,000. We are also--and the final thing that I would like to address is diabetes, the fourth leading cause of death in African American, Native Americans and Hispanic women, the sixth leading cause in Asian women and the seventh leading cause in white women. An estimated 16,000,000 Americans have diabetes, but only 10,600,000 cases are diagnosed, of which 4,200,000 are women. Left untreated, diabetes can lead to severe vision loss, heart disease, stroke, kidney disease, and amputation of the lower limbs. The current NIH appropriation earmarked for diabetes is only 65 percent of the funding necessary. Therefore, I am asking for 1,500,000,000, which is 100 percent of the funding needed to address this single most costly disease in America. Mr. Chairman I was really thrown aback when I went to one of the clinics in my district to find that young African American women, ages 25 to 35, are really being crippled with visual impairments due to diabetes because they do not have health insurance. And so we are asking for this increased funding for education programs, for research, and for treatment of women. We know that women now are making up 52 percent of the heads of households; there must be a wellness among women for them to continue to be sometimes the only breadwinner for our children. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. Mr. Regula. Thank you. I might mention to you, we did go to the Centers for Disease Control yesterday, nine of the committee members and the staff. It was a very interesting day, and they mentioned some of the things that you just brought out. Ms. Millender-McDonald. Thank you. Mr. Regula. I think one of the problems in diabetes is that people don't know they have it until their vision and some of the things you just mentioned becomes evident of it. Ms. Millender-McDonald. I will be following them. And thank you so much; the CDC and NIH I will be working with them, so I do thank you. Mr. Regula. They do a nice job. We will be hard-pressed to do all the things that we need to do---- Ms. Millender-McDonald. I know that is right. Mr. Regula [continuing]. With what is allocated to us, but we are going to give it a try. [The information follows:] [GRAPHIC(S) NOT AVAILABLE IN TIFF FORMAT] Tuesday, April 3, 2001. WOMEN IN SMALL BUSINESSES WITNESS HON. SHELLEY MOORE CAPITO, A REPRESENTATIVE IN CONGRESS FROM THE STATE OF WEST VIRGINIA Mr. Regula. Mrs. Capito. Ms. Capito. Thank you, Mr. Chairman, for allowing me to come here today and give you some brief and very general testimony. Wellness of women--I am the Vice Chair of the Women's Caucus--I am talking more wellness of women in terms of their economic wellness. In recent years women have made great strides in the workplace, especially as entrepreneurs. Between the years of 1987 and 1997 the number of women-owned businesses has increased 89 percent, and today there are more than 8,500,000 small business owners in the United States that are women, and many in West Virginia, my home State. The small business has been and always will be the key to the American dream, especially for women and other minorities. But erecting and ignoring government barriers that hinder their success will slow their creation of and stifle their growth. In February of this year, six of my constituents received Small Business Administration loans; three of those business owners were women. Although they were very happy to receive the financial support, they probably would have been happier if the government would remove some of the unnecessary regulations that prevent them from doing such things as offering expanded health insurance policies to their employees or creating new jobs, all things that could be done with the costs that they expend jumping through the hoops of government bureaucracy. Women need to have better access for financing, for they are small businesses. As leaders entrusted with this responsibility, we need to be vigilant and recognize these needless barriers that burden our small businesses. So we have to be aware that we need to not tolerate the unnecessary obstacles that prevent women and minorities from the American dream. I can't help but wonder how many more women or minority entrepreneurs we could have if we made starting and running a small business a little bit easier. So today I would like to ask that we work together to preserve and extend the ideas of the American dream, and let's send this message that the true entrepreneurial spirit is available to them. Thank you for letting me make this general statement. I appreciate you listening. Mr. Regula. Thank you. [The information follows:] [GRAPHIC(S) NOT AVAILABLE IN TIFF FORMAT] Mr. Regula. I read a comment the other day that--I think it was Germany's czar for production said, if his country had used women as effectively as the United States, it could have had a pretty substantial impact on their ability to fight World War II. He recognized--fortunately, belatedly--that women are very--and I think that was a unique phenomenon in the United States, the impact of the women on the war effort. Rosie the Riveter truly was a very great part of it. And the point you make is well taken that the role has expanded. When I came here there were 18 in the House, now we have how many? Mrs. Biggert. Sixty-one. Mr. Regula. There was one in the Senate. Now there are nine. Ms. Capito. Watch out. Mr. Regula. None on the Court and now we have two, of course. I was startled to sit with a lady the other day who had three or four stars, which is kind of unique too. Times have changed, fortunately for the better. Stephanie, you are on the third panel, but I will just take Louise and then we will come to you. ---------- Tuesday, April 3, 2001. NIH OFFICE OF RESEARCH ON WOMEN'S HEALTH WITNESS HON. LOUISE M. SLAUGHTER, A REPRESENTATIVE IN CONGRESS FROM THE STATE OF NEW YORK Mr. Regula. Mrs. Slaughter. Ms. Slaughter. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. Good morning to you and Ms. DeLauro. I guess, in view of this conversation, it is probably good to point out this is Equal Pay Day, and women in the United States are still only paid 78 cents to the male dollar. So we are making some progress, but it is going pretty slow there. And we have contributed a great deal; we do want to be recognized. I do appreciate the opportunity to testify before the subcommittee on issues that are important to the Women's Caucus. As a Vice Chair of the caucus, I speak on behalf of all my colleagues when I say that we look forward to continuing our excellent working relationship with this subcommittee under your leadership. I would like to highlight briefly two issues that are extremely important to the health of American women. The first is women's health research at the National Institutes of Health and particularly the efforts of the NIH's Office of Research on Women's Health. This is a tiny office with a monumental mission. It has a threefold mandate to, one, strengthen, develop, and increase research into diseases, disorders, and conditions that affect women, determine gaps in knowledge about such conditions and diseases, and establish a research agenda for NIH for the future directions in women's health research; Second, to ensure that women are included as participants in NIH-supported research; and Third, to develop opportunities and support for recruitment, retention, reentry and advancement of women in biomedical careers. Under the leadership of Dr. Vivian Pinn, this office has made major inroads on all of these issues. Its progress is hampered, however, by a lack of resources. Over the past 4 years they have received paltry budget increases, especially given the fact that Congress is working to double the NIH budget. For fiscal year 2000, NIH received a budget increase of 14 percent, but the ORWH budget was increased less than 4 percent. It is currently carrying out its mission with a $22,000,000 budget and, by contrast, the new Center for Minority Health and Health Disparities is funded at $132,000,000 for fiscal year 2001 and the Office of AIDS Research at $48,200,000. Last year I organized a letter from 22 women Members to Acting Director Ruth Kirschstein asking her to increase the budget. It is my understanding that she has requested a respectable budget increase for the Office of Research on Women's Health for fiscal year 2002. I hope the subcommittee will not only fund this request fully, but include language in the accompanying report encouraging the future permanent director to maintain this commitment. And that is a very important step. I would like to turn now to the other issue on my agenda, which is environmental health. The interplay between an individual's genetic predisposition to disease and the environment is not well understood. The evidence is clear and accumulating daily, however, that the by-products of our technology are linked to illness and that women are especially susceptible to these environmental health-related problems. There are many reasons for that, the makeup of a woman's body containing more fatty tissue, more exposure to household chemicals, and the like. You may have seen or heard Bill Moyers' recent report, titled ``Trade Secrets.'' Mr. Moyers detailed the fact that the chemical industry has kept confidential documents over the past 50 years about adverse health effects of workplace chemical exposures on their employees. In addition, a recent CDC report showed that all Americans have traces of pesticides, metals, and plasticizers in our blood and urine. What does this mean for our health? We don't know. However, the chemical industry has also provided great benefits to society through industrial and technical advancement. It is a question of benefit versus risk, but we need to at least understand the risk to make an assessment. I urge the subcommittee to provide increased funding for the National Institute of Environmental Health Sciences to enhance the research on environmental causes of disease so that we may improve the public health of America. This investment will save the lives and health of people who today suffer needlessly because we lack the scientific data to understand the effect of environment of exposures on human health. Mr. Chairman, I would like to note that I am proud to have recently introduced H.R. 183, the Women's Health Environmental Research Centers Act, a bill that will enhance scientific research in women's health and the environment and will fill a gap in the NIEHS research agenda by targeting resources to women's environmental health. NIEHS fully supports the initiative, and I would very much like to work with you, Mr. Chairman, on empowering the agency to create these research centers. Again, thank you very much for the opportunity to address you on these important issues. [The information follows:] [GRAPHIC(S) NOT AVAILABLE IN TIFF FORMAT] Mr. Regula. Thank you. I might mention that at CDC they have one section on environmental health generally. An interesting footnote, they said they could take a sample of your blood and tell you all the various components how much arsenic is in it, how much all the various metals. Ms. DeLauro was there. You want to go ahead and ask some questions or comments. Ms. Slaughter. They can tell you almost everything from a drop of blood, including all the diseases that you have had as a child. It is a remarkable fluid that we have here. As former microbiologist, I am very fond of it. Mr. Regula. I like a good supply myself. Ms. DeLauro. I will just briefly comment to Mrs. Slaughter it was a really fascinating what the CDC is doing--I was there with the group yesterday--particularly in this area and what we could do by way of tracking illnesses and so forth and dealing with genetic predispositions. So your words are well taken. Ms. Slaughter. Three to 4 percent of breast cancer in women is genetically linked; the rest of it must be environmental. So we need to study this very closely. Mr. Regula. Staff advises me that we are probably getting a larger allocation on the women's health issues. Ms. Slaughter. Thank you. I am so happy to hear that. Thank you very much. Mr. Regula. Mrs. Lowey. Mrs. Lowey. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. I personally want to thank you and thank the entire Women's Caucus. This is always the highlight of the presentations for us. And I want to particularly associate myself with your comments on environmental health. To date, they really haven't done enough work in that area. And I feel there so strongly the mapping we have done in New York, the coincidences between high rates in particular areas--not only New York, San Francisco, around the country. I think this is something that we have to continue looking at. I have always been interested in the work of Stephanie Coburn and the connections of her research with cancer. So I want to thank you and the entire Caucus for your presentations. Ms. DeLauro. I can explain it to my colleagues; I have to leave at 10:30. Pay Equity Day it is, and there is a press conference about the Paycheck Fairness Act, which, as my colleagues know, is a piece of legislation most of them are on for pay equity for women; and we are going to do that over on the Senate side this morning. But I just wanted to say, this is an unbelievable committee. When I first came, it was a 15-member committee. In terms of the representation for women, there are three Democratic members, there were two Republican members. I can go back and think about when it was Mrs. Pelosi, Mrs. Lowey, and myself, and Helen Bentley on the other side--a feisty, wonderful woman. But I think, Mr. Chairman, in terms of focus of this committee and where it goes and what it does not only on just women's health and those issues, but broadly, with the portfolio that exists in the committee, that I think women have made a difference; and the women members who come before this committee every single year talk about issues that face this Nation broadly and, I think, make a remarkable contribution to what is being done. Just one additional thing: When I first came here, it was only 10 years ago, I worked with women here who were courageous in charting the waters for the NIH, doing clinical trials for women and for minorities, and for there to be an Office of Women's Health at HHS; and because of the tenacity of the women who served in this body longer than 10 years ago--I look at people like Louise, Nita was here, it is people like Pat Schroeder and Barbara Kennelly and Nancy Johnson who charted the way--Connie Morella. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. I apologize to my colleagues for interrupting your testimony. Mr. Regula. Mr. Kennedy. Mr. Kennedy. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. I understand from my colleagues, Nita Lowey and RosaDeLauro, that they both have meetings at 10:30. This makes my arrival just right, so I can carry on for them when they leave. So I just want to thank you guys and say again, like Rosa said, this is a great committee and I really look forward to working on it. On the pay equity, we had a wonderful press conference and committee hearing up in Rhode Island about 2 weeks ago. The response was overwhelming. My local newspaper carried it front page, the whole story. My colleagues in the State legislature are pressing for it; they say they are not going to go for a budget that doesn't include it within State payroll. So it is not just equal pay, but pay equity, that there is a point system for jobs so that, you know, given experience and the duties of the job, that is going to be the criterion by which people are paid, not a set, you know, number of jobs that are set up. So anyway, thank you, Mr. Chairman. Thank you, my colleagues. Mr. Regula. Mr. Sherwood. Mr. Sherwood. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. I am looking forward to listening to my esteemed colleagues and helping them work on this very important program. Thank you. Mr. Regula. Well, thank all of you on the first panel. And I just want to tell you, if my wife and daughter were here, they would be cheering you on. Ms. Slaughter. I am sure you will, as well. ---------- Tuesday, April 3, 2001. NORTHEAST OHIO NEIGHBORHOOD HEALTH CENTERS WITNESS HON. STEPHANIE TUBBS JONES, A REPRESENTATIVE IN CONGRESS FROM THE STATE OF OHIO Mr. Regula. Our next panel. We have the three--oh, here is Connie. Don't wait. We will go ahead. Is Connie on panel 4? That is all right. Okay. It is very informal here. Okay, we will take them in the order I have them here. But you were here early, so we will start with you, Stephanie. Mrs. Jones. I appreciate you giving me the opportunity to plead. Mr. Chairman, the Congressional Black Caucus is holding election reform hearings somewhere in this building. I am trying to get over there to all my colleagues. Good morning. Just for the record I would like to add to the names of some people who have been working in the past on the issue of women's health: Mary Rose Oakar, as well as my predecessor, Louis Stokes. I got that in. I appreciate your extending time for me to relate some of the very urgent concerns of the 11th Congressional District regarding the provision of health care at federally qualified community health centers. Northeast Ohio Neighborhood Health Centers is located in the heart of Cleveland and serves some of the most impoverished neighborhoods in the city. As in most large cities, large hospital health care providers have been migrating out of the inner city. The end result of this migration is many more uninsured for our health care centers to serve. The majority of constituents served by these centers live under 100 percent of the Federal poverty line. Many of these people are now working but remain uninsured because their jobs do not provide health benefits. The rollout of Ohio's SCHIP has helped. SCHIP covers children who live at up to 200 percent of Federal poverty level. Moreover, the State of Ohio has expanded coverage to adults living at 100 percent of the Federal poverty level. The Northeast Ohio Neighborhood Centers have experienced an increase of almost 10 percent in the uninsured patient base in the last year, partially due to hospital closings. NEON is not the only provider that has suffered immensely from managed care in our city. Approximately one-half of NEON's 35,000 patients are children. Approximately 28,000 of those 35,000 patients live under 100 percent of the poverty level. Many of them have mental health or drug and alcohol problems as well as diabetes, hypertension, cancer or high-risk pregnancies, as well as other health issues that often parallel living in poverty. Twenty-three physicians and six dentists logged more than 115,000 encounters in the year 2000. NEON provides transportation, translation and counseling to encourage and empower patients. Despite the hospital closings, managed care and numerous other earth tremors in the health care system, NEON's community-based system of five health care center sites is still open and providing care. I will skip over only to say that the neighborhood health centers need additional support for them to continue to be able to provide care. In my district we lost two large hospitals in this control of the health care delivery system; and only on Sunday, in the Plain Dealer newspaper, it was reported that many of the hospitals are diverting patients. They close down their EMS center, their emergency room; and, therefore, the EMS trucks have to go to the next hospital, the next hospital. That has a significant impact on the delivery of health care. Very quickly, we would like to have $600,000 to do MIS upgrades or information management upgrades, as well as we seek $3,800,000 in addition to the MIS for many of the facilities that NEON operates. The facilities are old, and they are in need of renovation to be able to continue to provide care. I thank my colleagues and the Women's Caucus for giving me the opportunity to be heard today. I would ask this committee to keep in mind the desperate need of community health centers in our Nation and the need for them to provide care. I submit my testimony for the record. Also, let me not forget, there--I should say that, incidently, Mr. Chairman, you may also know that there is a center comparable in your community in Massillon. Mr. Regula. I am very aware of it. They reminded me several times. [The information follows:] [GRAPHIC(S) NOT AVAILABLE IN TIFF FORMAT] Tuesday, April 3, 2001. VARIOUS PROGRAMS WITNESS HON. CONNIE MORELLA, A REPRESENTATIVE IN CONGRESS FROM THE STATE OF MARYLAND Mr. Regula. I think what we will do is do the panel and then questions, because we have a pretty full schedule here to get through today. So, Connie, you are next. Mrs. Morella. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. I want to begin by congratulating you on the chairmanship of what I consider one of the most important subcommittees of the Appropriations Committee and thank you for extending to us this opportunity to testify before you. And, Ms. DeLauro, I am wearing my red for Equal Pay Day. Mr. Regula. Isn't there equal pay in the Congress? Mrs. Morella. Well, it is--actually, I would say it is one of the few places where we are pretty close to equal pay, but in so many other areas that is not the case. Among my top priorities is the continuation of our commitment to double the budget for the National Institutes of Health, and we are on the right track. We are in year number 4 of the 5-year plan. The President has called for $23,100,000,000, which is a 13.8 percent increase. To keep on track, we could use $23,700,000,000. Let me jump around to a couple of other issues that are important to all of us and indeed to me. Since 1990, I have been the sponsor of legislation to address women and AIDS issues. Women are the fastest-growing group of people with HIV, with low-income women and women of color being hit the hardest by the epidemic. AIDS is the leading cause of death in young African American women. We particularly urge your support for the development of a microbicide to prevent the transmission of HIV and sexually transmitted diseases at a level of $75,000,000. Currently, less than 1 percent of the budget for HIV and AIDS-related research at the National Institutes of Health is being spent on microbicide research. Actually, I would like to see the important work of the Office of AIDS Research quickly converted into a proactive, strategic plan for microbicide research and development that has the active involvement and support of NIH and institute leadership. Much progress has been made, but more needs to be done. You know, microbicides, I remember many years ago when I first introduced legislation I couldn't pronounce microbicide, but it is so critically important to making sure that we don't have HIV and AIDS and sexually transmitted diseases. It is like a vaginal solution that has nothing to do with a spermicide, so it is not a birth control method; and, boy, what a difference this would make in the world. I would like to jump to breast cancer. Mr. Chairman, as you know, women continue to face a one in eight chance of developing breast cancer during their lifetime. More than 2,600,000 women are currently living with breast cancer. This year alone more than 183,000 women will be diagnosed with breast cancer, and 41,000 women will die of the disease. This subcommittee has clearly demonstrated its commitment to breast cancer research. We urge you to continue this momentum in this fiscal year 2002. On behalf of all the women who live in fear of the disease, we urge the subcommittee to continue its strong commitment. And, Mr. Chairman, although it is not a widely known fact, tuberculosis is the biggest infectious killer of young women in the world. In fact, TB kills more women worldwide than all other causes of maternal mortality combined. Currently, an estimated one-third of the world's population, including 15 million people in the United States, are infected with the TB bacteria; and due to its infectious nature TB can't be stopped at national borders. So it is important to control TB in the United States, and it is impossible to control it until we control it worldwide. I urge support for an annual investment of $528,000,000 for the Centers for Disease Control in its efforts to eliminate TB. Of course, there is that multiple- drug-resistent strain of TB that is so dangerous. The Violence Against Women Act is a very important priority. We reauthorized it, added some new programs. Now I respectfully request that the funding become a priority for this subcommittee; and I am requesting that the shelters under the FVPSA, which is the Family Violence Prevention Act, be funded at their authorized level of $175,000,000 for fiscal year 2002. Also, transitional housing that Asa Hutchinson and Bill McCollum helped to put into that bill, the transitional housing program to be funded at its original and one-time authorization level of $25,000,000. Rape prevention and education to be funded at its full authorization level of $80,000,000 for fiscal year 2002. Several other programs I have mentioned in the testimony that I am submitting but are, very briefly, the Women in Apprenticeships and Nontraditional Employment Act, I introduced that many years ago, it has been working well on $1,000,000, to continue it. The Campus-Based Child Care Program, which is working to allow low-income women to have some assistance with child care on college campuses. What a great way to get them off of welfare and into the work world. That being said, you are very kind and gracious, you and the members of this subcommittee, Mr. Sherwood, and I see Ms. Pelosi is here. We had Ms. Lowey, Ms. DeLauro and Mr. Kennedy listening to us and hope that you will be able to accommodate these. [The information follows:] [GRAPHIC(S) NOT AVAILABLE IN TIFF FORMAT] Tuesday, April 3, 2001. PREVENTION OF DOMESTIC VIOLENCE WITNESS HON. SHELLEY BERKLEY, A REPRESENTATIVE IN CONGRESS FROM THE STATE OF NEVADA Mr. Regula. Could you all stay when you finish the panel? Then we will take the questions. Because we are on a pretty tight schedule to get through all the other witnesses. Ms. Berkley. Ms. Berkley. I am delighted to have an opportunity to testify before this subcommittee which enjoys a wonderful reputation for tackling issues of major importance to women and children and families in our Nation and has been instrumental in improving the quality of life for millions of American families that, prior to your interest and actions, had little hope for their futures or the futures of their children. I want to thank you for allowing me to speak today in support of increased funding for programs to prevent domestic violence. Crimes of domestic violence have devastating consequences for women personally, as well as for their families and for society as a whole. In my district of southern Nevada, I have visited shelters for battered women and talked with law enforcement officers, counselors and community leaders. I had an opportunity to do a drive-along with the police when they were doing their domestic violence shift, and I have seen firsthand the horrible effects domestic violence can have on a community. That is why today I ask you to continue efforts to prevent domestic violence by fully funding domestic violence grant programs within the Department of Health and Human Services. These programs, which include grants for rape prevention and education, community intervention and prevention organizations, as well as the National Domestic Violence Hotline, are vital to the fight against domestic violence. Of particular importance, however, is funding that supports shelters for battered women. These shelters are often the only source of protection and relief for women who are fleeing from a violent situation. Women across the country need the services that domestic violence programs provide; and, again, I urge you to fully fund these programs. I have had an opportunity to tour all of the domestic crisis shelters in southern Nevada in my district, from the ones where people are going just for a very temporary 24-hour situation to get them out of their house, get their children out of the house, to the more complex situations where, when I went to visit the shelters, they blindfolded me and drove me there because these are places that are so secret that the perpetrator of the violence cannot find his family and continue to perpetuate the crime against his family. Most of these women, when I sit down and speak to them, they tell me how desperate they are to have a place to go not only for themselves but particularly for their children. Many women are stuck in a violent situation because theydon't have anyplace to go, and they endure incredible violence in their homes because they are afraid to be without an income, without a roof over their heads, without shelter for their children. If we can provide this tool for them to get out of those situations, they can break this dependency and codependency that they have on the perpetrator of the violence and begin to get the counseling they need and break out of the situation and be able to take care of not only themselves but their children as well. Many times, it is just a shelter to house them until they can get on their feet. But if we don't provide this they will end up back in the abusive situation. When I was practicing law I spent a good deal of my pro bono time trying to help these women get out of the situation, provide them with low-cost divorces. But it wasn't--it was the dependency, it was the emotional damage, it was the psychological fear that they had of breaking that tie and getting out of their home and feeling that without that home they would be destitute and on the streets. And for many of these women they endure incredible pain and incredible violence just so their children aren't out in the streets. Again, I want to thank you very much, but unless we fully fund these domestic crisis shelters we are going to have this problem in perpetuity; and the cost to society is far more extensive if we don't spend the money to fully fund these shelters and these programs than if we don't. Mr. Regula. Thank you. Are you familiar with Parents Anonymous? It is--at least in Ohio they are pretty active where they--it is like single mothers can go and talk to each other and get help. It is a support group and somewhat goes to what you are discussing here. Ms. Berkley. There are many programs available, but in the final analysis, if the women has to go back to that violent environment, she is never going to break the cycle. Mr. Regula. Very true. [The information follows:] [GRAPHIC(S) NOT AVAILABLE IN TIFF FORMAT] Mr. Kennedy. Mr. Chairman, these grants also help us identify those children, because the National Institutes of Mental Health have developed an absolute correlation between children from families with domestic violence and drug abuse, cognitive delay in learning and further violence within the family among these children. This is absolutely a determinative in terms of the cycle of violence. So these grants have another effect of allowing us to try to address the needs of these children along with their mothers in many cases. So I look forward to working with you on making sure that we get some training for these kids, too, when they face these situations. A couple of States have done very well by these grants to get the whole families involved. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. Mr. Regula. Mr. Sherwood. Mr. Sherwood. Well, the testimony is very compelling; and we have all in our private lives seen examples. If there is anything that we can do, such as these grants, to put that behind us, we are certainly on the right track. Thank you. Mr. Regula. Ms. Pelosi. Ms. Pelosi. Mr. Chairman, while I was listening to the very excellent testimony of Representative Berkley, especially toward the end when she was talking about her own experience doing pro bono work, I was reminded of our work together when we were on Commerce, Justice, State together. We were able to-- I had worked with Senator Cohen, others in the Senate and this--not Senator Cohen, others in the Senate on the Republican side where we tried to make--for women to have legal assistance. They were testing the income of the spouse. So we had an amendment in our Commerce, Justice bill for legal assistance that would say that the income of the spouse would not be counted against the woman when she tried to get some legal assistance, some legal aid. Which made a very--as you well know, you graciously did pro bono work, but everyone is not able to avail themselves of that. So that made it a difference, too. But this has been a fight for a while in the Congress to get as much as possible for these grants. It is one of the proudest moments that we have, when the Women's Caucus comes before us with this array of issues that are so important; and we have been able to make a substantial difference in many areas of health, Mr. Chairman. Everybody understands that this is a tricky issue, because everyone is uncomfortable with it and all the more reason we have the maximum resources to do it. So I am glad the Women's Caucus has made this a priority. Mr. Regula. As you pointed out, you and I have been champions of legal services in Commerce, State because that is one way that women can get help that otherwise just wouldn't be available. Tuesday, April 3, 2001. COMMUNITY HEALTH CENTERS WITNESS HON. LORETTA SANCHEZ, A REPRESENTATIVE IN CONGRESS FROM THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA Mr. Regula. Mrs. Sanchez. Ms. Sanchez. Thank you, Mr. Chairman, and congratulations on your chairmanship. Thank you to the entire subcommittee for allowing us to come before you to testify today. I would lend my voice to many of the issues that--probably all of the issues that these women are going to talk to today, but in particular I want to take a couple of minutes to talk about increasing the funding for community health centers. We would like to see an increase in the amount of $250,000,000. I will tell you, it is some of best money that we can spend, because this directly affects areas that are usually low income, as parts of my district are. It is about putting health care readily accessible to people there, because they either don't have transportation or they do not have an ability to get off work or they have children they have got to take care of or they have to bring the children with them. What happens when you don't have community health clinics is that people don't go and see a doctor. When they do go and see the doctor, it is with a very chronic problem already when they walk through the front door. Where is it that they go? They don't go to a clinic. They go to an emergency hospital where they know it is the highest cost of delivery in the entire health care system. So when we are able to put these community clinics in areas where people can come, they can come with their kids, they can walk, they are readily available, they are open on Saturdays and Sundays, and they can get preventative medicine. They can work on issues of nutrition for diabetes, for example, where the Latino community has about five times the amount of diabetes in our community than anybody else in the United States, and that is simply because of nutrition. There are problems that we have that become very expensive if we don't get access to health in a meaningful way to people in lower income areas. One of the things that has happened in my district and why I feel so strongly about this is that we are now seeing what we call back room clinics in pharmacies. So if you go to an independent pharmacy or you go to a drugstore that doesn't even have a pharmacy there in my area and you need something, you need medication for your kid, your kid is sick, what is happening is that these people are taking them into the back room, somebody who is not even a doctor is analyzing what is wrong with this kid and giving them drugs that are either coming in, brought across the border from Mexico--and we have had, just in the last 6 months, an 18-month-old baby girl and a 15-year-old boy die because of illegal drugs, prescription drugs coming from someplace else being given to these kids. And these parents are--this is the kind of health care that they think they can afford. So the more that we can do to put in neighborhood clinics the better it will be for all of us in the long run. We don't need to lose these kids simply because parents are doing the best that they think they can do in a system that is pretty much ignoring them. And I am talking about working people. I am talking about people who have taxes taken out of their paychecks. I am talking about people who pay taxes when they go and they buy everything at the store. These are people who are low income and need the access to health care. So I would hope that you would really consider increasing the amount towards the community health care centers. Mr. Regula. Thank you. Any questions? [The information follows:] [GRAPHIC(S) NOT AVAILABLE IN TIFF FORMAT] Tuesday, April 3, 2001. TRANSITIONAL HOUSING WITNESS HON. JANICE D. SCHAKOWSKY, A REPRESENTATIVE IN CONGRESS FROM THE STATE OF ILLINOIS Mr. Regula. Our next witness is Mrs. Schakowsky, the successor to my great friend, Sid Yates. Ms. Schakowsky. As I was going to say, Mr. Chairman, though you and I don't know each other very well, I feel very warmly toward you because of the great relationship that you had and the things Sid Yates said about you, so thank you very much. Mr. Regula. I still miss him. He used to call me after I was gone to tell me how to run the committee. Ms. Schakowsky. Well, I wanted to also talk about violence against women and the needs for transitional housing, and I am so glad that Connie Morella spoke to you about it. Shelly Berkeley talked about the need for shelters. I wanted to particularly emphasize the $25,000,000 for transitional housing that was authorized in the Victims of Trafficking and Violence Protection Act of 2000. So I am hoping that that money now can be appropriated. The Department of Justice has identified 960,000 women annually who report having been abused by their husbands and boyfriends, but we know that number is really just the tip of the iceberg. The first comprehensive national health survey of American women conducted by the Commonwealth Foundation says that 3.9 million American women actually experience abuse by an intimate partner each year, 3.9 million. Hundreds of these women, hopefully thousands, are able to get out of those situations, but they have few financial resources and often have no place to go. Lack of affordable housing and long waiting lists for assisted housing mean that many women and their children are forced to choose between abuse at home or on the streets. While we absolutely need more money for shelters because they are filled to capacity right now, we know that, in fact, 50 percent of homeless women and children--that is, 50 percent of the families, the women and children who are homeless right now are fleeing abuse. So the connection between housing and abuse is overwhelming. Housing can prevent domestic violence and mitigate its effects. Shelters provide immediate safety to battered women and their children and help women gain control over their lives and get on their feet. A stable, sustainable home base is crucial for women who have left a situation of domestic violence. While dealing with the trauma of abuse, they are also learning new job skills, participating in educational programs, working full-time jobs or searching for adequate child care in order to gain receive sufficiency. Transitional housing resources and services provide a continuum between those first emergency shelters and independent living and so those transitional housing dollars are very important. According to estimates by the McAuley Institute, $25,000,000 in funding for transitional housing would provide assistance to at least 2,700 families. We must be supportive of individuals who are escaping violence and seeking to better their lives. In closing, let me reiterate my appreciation to the subcommittee and restate my strong support for providing safe transitional housing assistance to women and children fleeing domestic violence. Thank you. Let me just, on a personal note, mention that my last visit to this committee last year I was sitting next to Loretta Sanchez. Actually, it was sort of depressing because she was talking about being in the first Head Start class and how important it was, and I was there to talk about being the first--teaching the first Head Start class. I thought, oh, my word, the difference here. But I am so happy that so many of us are here today talking about domestic violence and the importance of providing the support for women seeking to flee that. [The information follows:] [GRAPHIC(S) NOT AVAILABLE IN TIFF FORMAT] Mr. Regula. We hope that in Head Start we can maybe improve on it and make it a little more of an educational experience, rather than just warehousing of kids. That tends to be the characteristic of it, and I think you will miss a great opportunity in Head Start to not do more on the education side of it. I have never figured out quite why it was in the welfare department and not in the education department. Ms. Schakowsky. Head Start has been a wonderfully successful program. Mr. Kennedy. Mr. Chairman, on the Head Start, the thing that the teachers say is most important is the social and emotional development of the child. That is what gives them the cognitive advantage over those kids that haven't gone through Head Start. So it is not so much that they are learning their ABCs, but they are in an environment that starts to make it conducive to learning down the road. So it is kind of an interesting thing. But it is not the cognitive development so much at Head Start, which is what we think it is, but it is the social and emotional development, which I might add is lacking in our other primary education, which we need to work on. Ms. Schakowsky. I agree. I didn't want to step on my own message, though. I wanted to be sure that I am focusing here on the $25,000,000 for the transitional housing. Mr. Regula. This committee has a broad jurisdiction. Any other questions? Thank you very much. ---------- Tuesday, April 3, 2001. ENFORCEMENT OF WORK PLACE PROTECTIONS WITNESS HON. HILDA SOLIS, A REPRESENTATIVE IN CONGRESS FROM THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA Mr. Regula. Mrs. Solis. Ms. Solis. Thank you, Mr. Chairman and members. It is a pleasure to be here for the first time to speak before your subcommittee; and I want to add my comments also, along with those that have been made by previous members, regarding health care research and the whole issue of domestic violence. Just as kind of a footnote there, in my own district I was successful in getting one shelter established in Los Angeles County in the area that I represented. It is a really sad situation when you think about all the animal shelters that exist in my district. When you put a price at where you value human life and what have you, we only were able to get funding for one shelter. So much more is sorely needed. I would hope that this committee would strongly take a good look at how we can enhance partnerships, both public and private, with law enforcement, so we can have both permanent shelters for those and transitional. Our problem in our district is that we have many women who are faced with this issue of domestic violence, and with that bring their children. In cases for Latinos, for example, you are talking about 4 or 5 siblings, children that come along with that one woman, who is looking for a place to go and possibly a warm meal, a roof over her head, but also the opportunity to find employment. So I would hope that this will be a priority for this coming session. But my remarks, I would like to focus in on the issue of enforcement of Federal wage and overtime laws by the Department of Labor. As you go through in crafting the Labor-HHS funding budget for fiscal year 2002, I would like to urge the committee to allocate sufficient funds for the enforcement of workplace protections. This issue is very critically important to women, not just in my district, but in many corners of our country, particularly in those areas where you find an enormous number of low skilled workers, women in particular, who are working, as an example, in the garment industry. My district has a very high proportion of individuals who work in the garment industry. Unfortunately, a few years ago it was discovered there was a sweatshop in the City of El Monte, which I happen to represent. There were 72 women, Thai women, that were held hostage there, many for 7 years. They did not mention though, however, in those news articles, there were many Latino women also working there day in and day out and were forced to work under very harsh conditions and were not given minimum wage, were not given overtime, were actually placed in a warehouse setting where they were pretty much locked in and could not leave the compound as it was later viewed by the public. I would hope that we could do as much as we can to help to provide information to the workforce, but particularly women that tend to be attracted to this particular type of industry, because it is a problem, not only in California, but along the border and other parts of the country, where I believe we need to do more to provide those protections for women and their children, because we also know there are many children working in it these factories as well. Because of a lack of resources in the past few years and also on the part of our local municipalities that may not have enough funding to follow through on code enforcement to really go through and find out if, for example, a true small business is actually working legitimately and that they are paying for their licenses and what have you. We are finding there has been a cutback in these areas, and obviously that leads to more abuse. So I would hope that this committee would take a strong look at protecting the rights of women in the workplace as we work towards pay equity. We also have to work towards a place, an environment, where they can work and be treated with dignity, and that they are fully aware of their rights when they are at the workplace, and that the employer also plays a meaningful role in providing that kind of information as well. This year we are going to be working on trying to elevate the minimum wage. In the State of California, we happen to have a higher minimum wage than here at the Federal level, and I hope we can work in partnership to bring some equity. That isn't to say where I would like to see it. I would like to see it much more higher, but at least it is a start. I would hope we can venture into those discussions. I would like to thank you for the opportunity to speak to you today. Mr. Regula. Thank you. We will bring this issue up with Mrs. Chao when she testifies, because it would be her department responsibility. Questions. Ms. Pelosi. No questions.

NAPOLITANO, A MEMBER OF CONGRESS FROM THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA Mr. Regula. Thank you very much. Our next witness is Mrs. Napolitano. Am I saying it right? Ms. Napolitano. You are very right on, sir. Good morning, and thank you so much for the opportunity you have given the Women's Caucus to come before you and bring the issues that all of us feel are important. I associate myself with the remarks at every turn. One of the reasons, Mr. Chairman and members, that I am here, is because there is an issue that has been identified in the last 2 years dealing with youth mental health crisis in this country. Recent incidents in school shootings only add more urgency to that particular matter, and that is the reason why I am here, again, to respectfully request you continue support for the school-based Latino mental health services program in my an area. It is a pilot we begun. Let me provide some disturbing facts that illustrate, and I am sure you heard them before, but I just need to get them to you again, the depth of the crisis for young Latinos in the country. Today, nearly one in three Latino adolescents has seriously considered suicide. This is the highest rate for any racial or ethnic group in the whole country. Additionally, they also lead their peers in the rates of alcohol and drug abuse, teen pregnancy, and self-reported gun handling. These statistics are all more alarming when one considers that fewer prevention and treatment services reach young Latinos than any other racial or ethnic group. This is a report that came to us in 1999 with the state of Hispanic girls through the National Alliance for Hispanic Health, a conglomerate of groups that provide mental health services for Latino groups. This is in spite of the fact that Hispanic girls now represent the largest minority of girls in the country, and are expected to remain so for the next 50 years. Last year this subcommittee gratefully took a major and laudable step when it directed SAMHSA to provide $680,000 through the programs of national and regional significance activity, center for the mental health services, to begin addressing the mental health need of Latino adolescents through innovative school-based mental health services in our area. What we have done is we have taken the nonprofit mental health care provider and all other mental health advisers and have gone to the schools, setting the program actually in three middle schools and a high school, to give the direct services. The funding does not go to the State, does not go to the county, but goes directly to the providers and the schools where the most need is. Now I am asking, I am urging and I am begging the subcommittee to give this fledgling pilot program an opportunity to make a difference in the lives of these young women and many others. School administrators, teachers, community mental health providers, and parents, and, most importantly, young Latinos believe this program is urgently needed. This subcommittee and Congress has begun to provide national leadership in dealing with this crisis and in finding appropriate solutions. Our aim as a society should be to help these young girls reach their true potential and allow them to make positive contributions to their communities, to their State and to their Nation. Failure to do so may condemn a generation of young girls to lives that are significantly less hopeful and productive than they deserve. Again, I respectfully request the subcommittee to continue providing this program at the same level of funding as last year, and hopefully this program will provide a way for duplication throughout other areas where it may be so desperately needed at this point. Thank you again for the consideration, and look forward to answering any questions you may have. Mr. Regula. Thank you. Questions. Mr. Kennedy. Yes, Mr. Chairman. I applaud you for your work on this. I have been working with the chairman to address this issue. Would you kind of explain further how the schools end up being a non-stigma environment so the kids can get the help in the schools, rather than in some mental health counseling outside, which would certainly be so loaded with stigma, and of course explain the culture, the Latino culture, so that it really oppresses people with this mental health issue. We think we have got a stigma. Imagine what it is for the Latino culture. Ms. Napolitano. It is a tremendously important area to be able to provide the service in the school itself. Understanding that my Latino friends and relatives and my peers and everybody else, they consider it an area that you don't go. You don't talk about it, you don't bring it up. Especially in the male Latino, you just don't admit that you have a mental problem. The stigma is they don't know the difference between a mental health issue and a mental disease issue. Part of what has happened in our society, and the Latino society specifically, is this has carried on to the family, you are not allowed to admit you have a mental problem or a mental health issue that can be dealt with, that you can talk out. So the idea is to have it in the schools where the peer pressure is. These teachers can be a part of it. The parents will be a part of it. This is not just a school thatis going to be involved. It is a whole community effort by bringing all the players in at the school to deal with the issue. The classrooms are going to be set up so that they can go to specific rooms to deal with it, and there will be classes given to others that do not have the same problem of dealing with mental health issues, but rather to understand that it is not a stigma, but rather an idea for them to identify, in their own mind, how they can deal with pressures and those kind of issues. Mr. Kennedy. Thank you very much. Mr. Regula. Mr. Sherwood. Mr. Sherwood. Thank you very much. Ms. Napolitano. Thank you.

SHEILA JACKSON-LEE, A REPRESENTATIVE IN CONGRESS FROM THE STATE OF TEXAS Mr. Regula. Okay. Ms. Jackson-Lee. Ms. Jackson-Lee. Thank you very much, Mr. Chairman. It is nice to see you, and thank all the members for being here on a Tuesday morning. Might I associate myself with all of my fellow colleagues from the Women's Caucus and their different issues. Might I particularly associate myself with my colleague sitting next to me on the issue of mental health. I have offered, over the last two sessions, the Omnibus Give a Kid a Chance Mental Health Bill, that deals with providing more resources for children that are dealing with mental health concerns. I would like to give you what you may already know very quickly, and then focus in particular on the concerns that I have. Mr. Chairman, I think you may be aware that 13.7 million children in this country have diagnosable mental health disorder, yet less than 20 percent of them receive treatment. The White House and U.S. Surgeon General have recognized mental health needs to be a national priority in this Nation's debate about comprehensive health care. I have found that at least 1 in 5 children, adolescents, have a diagnosable mental, emotional or behavorial problem that may lead to school failure, substance abuse, violence or suicide. However, 75 to 80 percent of these children do not receive the services. According to a 1999 report of the U.S. Surgeon General for young people 15 to 24 years old, suicide is the third leading cause of death behind intentional injury and homicide. In particular, in the African American community, the U.S. Surgeon General has found that the rate of suicides among African American youth has increased 100 percent in the last decade. Black male youth, ages 10 to 14, have shown the largest increase in suicide rates since 1980 compared to other youth groups by sex and ethnicity, increasing 276 percent. Almost 12 young people between the ages of 15 and 24 die every day by suicide. When we speak about another selective group in the study of gay male and lesbian youth suicide, the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services found lesbian and gay youth are two to six times more likely to attempt suicide than other youth and account for up to 30 percent of all completed teen suicides. I interact with such a group, family group, in Houston, working with these young people in particular, trying to make adults available to be engaged in their lives. You see it firsthand because, as my colleague said, they are intimidated, they don't know where to turn for information. They are different, whether they are Latino, whether they are African American, whether they are different by way of a lifestyle, whether they are different by way of their particular religious background. Mr. Regula. Do you think they recognize that they have a need? Ms. Jackson-Lee. No, Mr. Chairman. I think, as my colleague has said, sometimes it is culturally different, sometimes there is a cultural difference. If I take my community, the African American community, very heavily based in religious beliefs, it is well-known that you are directed toward your Savior, and, if you are not grounded in that, then you are not directed anywhere. It is a stigma in the community, and I would argue, not having firsthand experience to the gay and lesbian teenager, but as I have been told by groups that advocate for them, they particularly are isolated because they are different. So I think what it is is that I don't know what I have, I am confused, but no one will understand me. So I think that this whole concept of having services, whether it is in the schools, which I support, whether it is in community-based health clinics, which I support, because I want parents to be able to feel free who are not able to access the private sector for psychiatric or counseling service, to have the access to do this. This is not a conversation about guns, Mr. Chairman. I know it is well known, my position, but I think over the last 48 hours, we have saw some studies that were shocking aboutteenage boys being able to have access to guns or bring guns to school. So we know that our children suffer from gun violence. Handgun Control reports that in 1996, more than 1,300 children, aged 10 to 19, committed suicide with firearms. What I would like to get at is the intervening act factor, to be able to help these young people before they get to that point. With the high number of uninsured young people, Texas has the second highest rate of uninsured children in the Nation with over 25 percent, there are programs that you support that I would like to ask for increased support. The National Mental Health Association has a children's mental health services program that provides grants to public entities for comprehensive community-based mental health services for children with serious emotional disturbances. These grants go to direct services that include diagnostic, evaluation services, outpatient services at schools, at home, and in the clinic, and day treatment. I would like to see that funded and provided additional funding. In addition, I would like to see parity for alcohol and drug addiction treatment for young people and their families. I emphasize their families, Mr. Chairman. I think that is an excellent combination, because many times the adults in the home, whoever is the supervising adult, a grandmother maybe, are as much in need of service as might be the child. I met with these individuals through the National Mental Health Association, and I had grandmothers raising 15-year-olds who already had a child and already tried to attempt to commit suicide 2 or 3 times, a little girl 15 years old. And to see the grandmother who was not that old to have to confront the needs of this 15-year-old, they both needed to be in counseling. The Children Mental Services Health Program only serves now 34,000 children, so I ask the committee to authorize $93 million for that. The Safe Schools Health Student Initiative is another program of the Children's Mental Health Services Program, and I would ask for $78 million involved in that program. Quickly, Mr. Chairman, I want to move from mental health and focus briefly only on children as victims of HIV-AIDS. I know this may have been previously discussed. I support a particular community organization called the Donald R. Watkins Memorial Fund, which has seen its dollars cut drastically. It is estimated that 800,000 to 900,000 Americans are living with HIV and every year another 40,000 become infected. I happen to come from a community in Houston that at the time of the issuance or the establishment of the Ryan White treatment dollars, we were 13th in the Nation of HIV infected. That was about 1991-92. My particular community has not decreased as much as we would like, and we find a large number of our young people infected with HIV-AIDS. In fact, we find a large number of African American's infected, and particularly children. So I would ask to receive a total additional amount, I believe this is $4 million during FY 2000, and even more during FY 2001. Let me get this amount into the record. I am asking for an increase for $89 million for Title I, $45 million for Title II, $46 for Title III, $19 million for Title IV, so Houston will receive additional funds, as well as the Nation, and I am particularly asking for direct grants for Donald R. White Memorial Foundation for $500,000 for their special services dealing with children and young people. I will conclude, because my statistics may be a little long, to simply say that Andy Williams in California, Columbine, we can all talk about guns, we can talk about taking guns away from children, but these children are disturbed. And as I followed this, I had a hearing in my district with Senator Wellstone. It is amazing. First of all, what we do is we put most of them in a juvenile justice system, because we don't have any place to put them. The parents don't know what to do. The parents don't intervene soon enough. If we had just known, or Andy Williams had somewhere to go to talk about this bullying or maybe talk to the children about character issues. And I think mental health, if we can destigmatize it and ensure that children feel free--it is just like coming to a counselor or going to Burger King or McDonald's, to be able to express your feelings, we might not have all of these painful situations that are happening in our community. I am with these children, I talk to the gay and lesbian youth, it is really an emotional situation when you speak to them. No one cares about them. I just think we can do better. I know how we are fighting, when I say fighting, I know the difficulty of appropriators. I appreciate all of you very much. But this has gotten to be a crisis in our Nation, not taking care of our children who are disturbed and resulting in adults who are dysfunctional. So I would appreciate very much your indulgence. I conclude by simply saying I had an amendment on underserved populations in the last Congress, and this is what this is all about, many underserved populations, because they are not getting some of the services that they need. Mr. Regula. I think you are suggesting that there ought to be counselors available somewhere for this disturbed youth to go. Ms. Jackson-Lee. Somewhere, and it can be either theschool- based efforts, that I support enthusiastically, and then there are these community-based mental health clinics that, because they are in the community, they can be called any manner of names. Whether they have to be called mental health clinics, they become familiar. The National Mental Health Association has interfaced with this structure, where they put them in the community and the parent, the guardian, whoever it is, can go with the child, and it may be down the block, or it may be just a few blocks away, or maybe connected to the school, or it may be connected to some community-based group. But what it does is it allows the families to come without stigma and also not go very far away. When you hear the word ``psychiatrist'' or do you have to go to a doctor's office, these are community-based entities that may be helpful. I think they are in only 34 States right now. Mr. Regula. Could they be part of the community health centers? We have had testimony here about the importance of those. Ms. Jackson-Lee. That is part of the effort of the National Mental Health Association. We would like to see more funding so they could be in more states. [The information follows:] [GRAPHIC(S) NOT AVAILABLE IN TIFF FORMAT] Mr. Regula. Mr. Kennedy. Mr. Kennedy. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. This is not social science; this is not soft science. We have the Surgeon General just come out with his report on children's mental health. This is part of the health. The brain is like any other organ. It is like diabetes, asthma, it is a chronic illness, it needs to be treated regularly. We have one in five children, according to the Surgeon General's report and as Ms. Jackson-Lee pointed out, who have severe emotional mental illness, and the schools are one of the primary places to capture them, because that is obviously a non-stigma environment. In addition to that, as Ms. Jackson-Lee pointed out, the community health centers are good places. But what we also need to do is train the primary care physicians to identify depression and mental illness. You would be surprised how many regular primary care general physicians do not know how to identify this, and therefore it goes undetected. You also, being a member of Commerce-Justice-State, the Office of Juvenile Justice and Deliquency Prevention, the juvenile crime rate is going up. What is the surprise? We know through sociological studies that parents are spending one-third less time with children today than they did just a couple of decades ago. If you don't think that comes with a price, when you have two parents working or it is a single-parent family, where that child doesn't see the parent until the end of the night and the child has to be put to bed, this is a significant cost to our society. We need to bring the families together somehow, and hopefully these kinds of programs will help do it. I just wanted to pass that along. Mr. Regula. Mr. Sherwood. Mr. Sherwood. Thank you very much. Mr. Regula. Mrs. Pelosi. Ms. Pelosi. Mr. Chairman, I just want to associate myself with Mr. Kennedy's remarks. We have to have parity in terms of mental health and what other people call other health issues. I particularly want to commend both of our witnesses for their focus on the School-Based Mental Health Initiative, and also Congresswoman's Jackson-Lee's testimony about HIV-AIDS, and I want to say that thanks to both of our witnesses and many women here this morning, we were able to send a letter to President Bush on March 29 signed by 153 members in a bipartisan fashion to talk about the AIDS epidemic. I think that at some point we will have the opportunity to meet with the President on this subject, and the subject of young people and HIV-AIDS, which is certainly an important component of it. We are optimistic we can meet with the President. Good work on these issues. Mr. Chairman, the testimony that people bring in for a few minutes is important to us. This is like the tippy-tippy-tip of the iceberg of the work that they do in that regard. Thanks to both of you. Mr. Regula. I would be curious, since the Secretary of Education is from your town, did you have anything in the school system there, any counseling, that would be accessible to students in a disturbed state? Ms. Jackson-Lee. We were beginning to make some progress on school-based health clinics. In those health clinics we had individuals who could stand in for counselors. When I say that, nurses who were trained, et cetera, they could go right in the school. They are slowly but surely--in fact, we argued in the present legislative session in Texas for more funding for school-based clinics. But we, too, I would say the Secretary of Education is very open to this, but we too need more growth in those areas. I will also I guess acknowledge that we have been--I will knock on some wood here-- fairly fortunate in Houston, but again, I don't take any special pride, because violence breaks out anywhere and everywhere. So it is just that it is something that we need to make great strides on. Might I just say on the hearing that I had in Houston, the juvenile justice officials came forward and noted whatCongressman Pelosi noted and Congressman Kennedy noted, is that we don't know what to do with these children. They said you are sending them to us because we are the only physical plant they can be housed. You would think they would say bring them on or we are prepared to do it, but they were the ones pleading with us, find us more mental health services because you are sending us children who we can't treat, we can only house them. Mr. Kennedy. Mr. Chairman, if I could, these kids who end up in our juvenile justice system, you have 95 percent or higher that come from abusive homes. This is, like, the correlation is too great. We know which kids are high risk. We ought to intervene earlier. These kids, by the time they end up in the juvenile justice system, the parents know, the teachers know, the schools know, for us to let them slip through its cracks itself is criminal. On the Elementary and Secondary Education Act with the Education Secretary, this might be a good issue for us to try to include somewhere in the Elementary and Secondary Education Act, because it is so fundamental to the child's education. Mr. Regula. We will have an opportunity when the Secretary of Education is before us to talk about that, and probably one of the things that teacher education should include is some course or so that would, because the teacher would be a very good person to identify disturbed children early. Ms. Napolitano. They are with them a major portion of the time, and they can tell when the student is beginning to act up or the grades are beginning to fall. Mr. Chairman, I have a mental health hospital in my area and have been involved for many years at the adult level. We have also different clinics from the Mental Health Association that I have been involved with through the years. They deal with really mostly the disease more than the illness. I think it is time we began to add substance to the local provision of services by giving some assistance to the families, as my colleague was saying, for mental health services. What we are attempting to do is begin to show that the partnership between the county and the State, adding additional services, maybe not even in funding, but services, whether it is personnel or whether it is a locale, so that we can expand on the delivery of the service at the local level. You are right. The correlation of the children, the neglected one, the at-risk kids, all has a bearing, and we all know those areas. So if we can target the areas and begin to work with the community to be able to deal with the child, we will be successful. That is what I am attempting to do, along with my colleague. Mr. Regula. Thank you both for coming. It is a significant problem you have identified. We will do what we can. Ms. Jackson-Lee. Mr. Chairman, may I ask a procedural question on the time that members have to have requests in? Mr. Regula. The 27th of April. Ms. Jackson-Lee. It has not passed. Someone had given me a date that caused migraine indigestion. Mr. Regula. My experience in Interior is some requests may not be timely, but they still get to the chairman. Ms. Jackson-Lee. I am trying to meet your rules and regulations. So you are saying April 27th? Mr. Regula. That is correct. Ms. Jackson-Lee. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. ---------- Tuesday, April 3, 2001. RE: PROJECTS WITNESSES HON. BRAD SHERMAN, A REPRESENTATIVE IN CONGRESS FROM THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA Mr. Regula. Mr. Sherman. Mr. Sherman. Mr. Chairman, it is interesting to appear before you in a new capacity. I want to thank the members of the subcommittee for being here. I have had a number of projects in my district that I think will interest the subcommittee. The first--I guess it works better when you turn the microphone on. The first is a request for $500,000 to help build the new Guadalupe Community Center in the poorest part of my district. It is a program run by Catholic Charities of Los Angeles. The building program will cost $1.5 million. Private charities will come through with one-third of that amount, the City of Los Angeles roughly a third, and I am asking the Federal Government to provide the final third. The center serves 900,000 individuals from low income families, 84 percent of its clients are Hispanic. It provides emergency food, clothing, case management, senior nutrition, welfare to work services, a youth mentoring program. Due to immigration, there is a substantial additional need. The center needs to expand so it can provide English as a second language and computer and math skills. That is the first project on my list, is a request for half a million dollars for the Guadalupe center. The next two projects are so important that I am bringingthem to the subcommittee's attention, even though 80 percent of the project is outside my district. The projects will take place primarily in Elton Gallegly's district. He and I share Ventura County. He can't be here today. He is counting on my eloquence to explain the programs. The first is a preventive health care program for the people of Ventura County. This is an outreach program to provide preventative health so we don't have people showing up at emergency rooms. The county has had a drop of roughly 20,000 people in the number who are in Medicaid, but then there has been a 20,000 increase in the number who were on Medicaid and now have no insurance at all. This is an innovative program to provide cost-effective preventive medical services. Some $9 million is being provided by the county, and we need $5 million of Federal funds, slightly more than a third, Federal funds for this program. The next of the two Ventura County projects that are primarily outside my district is a Center for Mental Health Services grant request dealing with mental health services for those in prison, in transition to being released and rejoining society. This program has already received $900,000 in Federal support for start-up, and the State has granted $1.6 million. It is an innovative program to provide a full range of mental health services to those in prison. There has been a significant reduction in recidivism from those who get this kind of treatment, and this is, I think, an ideal pilot study to show the importance of this treatment to other county prison facilities. The next project I am seeking $2.75 million for a child care center in Newbury Park. This will go an along with some local funds. The total budget is $3 million. We are also seeking in roughly the same area funds for a senior adult center expansion. Finally, for a YMCA that will be focusing much of its attention on the low income people of the region, providing social services. Roughly half the money there is being provided by local government and local charities, and we are seeking the other half from the Federal Government. Mr. Regula. Thank you. Things haven't changed too much since Interior. Mr. Sherman. I do have many things on the list, but I did put them in what I think is a reasonable order. As I say, the first one is a $500,000 project. Mr. Regula. Questions. Mr. Honda. ---------- Tuesday, April 3, 2001. RE: EDUCATIONAL PROGRAMS WITNESS HON. MIKE HONDA, A REPRESENTATIVE IN CONGRESS FROM THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA Mr. Honda. Good morning, Mr. Chairman. I think the last time I was before you we were talking about sleep or fatigue; is that correct? Mr. Regula. Right. Mr. Honda. I just want to thank the Chair and the distinguished members for the opportunity to present my testimony today. I have submitted a full written testimony for the record, but today I would like to focus on increasing school construction, recruiting 100,000 new teachers over the next 7 years, increasing Pell grants, as well as fully funding special education. If we are going to judge teachers, Mr. Chairman, and students by test scores, then Congress must fund programs that encourage improvement, growth within education, and we must demonstrate a commitment and respect and confidence in students by providing safe, permanent classrooms that are not crumbling. Nearly 80 percent of Americans support providing Federal funding for school repair and modernization, yet the President's budget eliminates $1.2 billion the Congress approved last year for school renovation and cuts another $433 million in unspecified programs. It would take nearly $112 billion to bring public and elementary and secondary schools to adequate condition. Thisfunding would help renovate up to 14,000 needy public schools and serve around 14 million students. I urge the committee to spend the $24.8 billion over the next 2 years in new tax credit bonds to renovate up to 6,000 schools. If we want students to learn more at a faster rate, then we need to reduce class size to enable teachers to teach efficiently. We also need to provide the teachers with the best training in order for them to provide the best instruction, and in order to attract and train teachers for both high need schools and underserved teaching topics, such as math and science, Congress should increase compensation for qualified teachers. According to the National Center for Education statistics, elementary and secondary school enrollment will grow from 52.2 million in 1997 to 54 million in 2006, requiring new schools and new teachers. Research has also shown that students in smaller classes and grades K-3 learn fundamental schools better and continue to perform well even after returning to larger classes after third grade. I urge the committee to continue to recruit 300,000 new teachers over the next 7 years in order to reduce class size averages in the early grades. I also encourage the $1 in new funding in 2002 and $18.4 billion over the next 10 years to provide up to $5,000 in supplemental pay to fully qualified teachers in high poverty schools or those in need of improvement under Title I. I request an increase of $600 in the maximum Pell grant, for a total of $4,350. I also ask that Congress fully fund special education in order to free up general fund money to allow schools to spend their money where it is most needed. By failing to meet these needs, Mr. Chairman, in the education system, we are failing to meet the needs of every single American. If we truly expect our schools to meet the challenges of greater accountability and higher achievement, then we as Congress need to ensure that we continue to fund the initiatives that we have put forward. Congress, as well as schools, need to be held accountable for their actions, and accountability is a two-way street. I just want to close by talking about accountability, and I guess student achievement. We know that we have made mandates, such as PL 94-142, which is requiring the pursuit of special education identification of youngsters. Since we are at 13 to 15 percent funding level, where we said we would be funding them at 40 percent, this ties up, as you well know, a lot of the local funds that school districts are trying to use, as they try to meet the mandates. So we have created a mandate without the full funding. As a school principal of two schools, identifying youngsters, I know this is a big struggle between parents who want youngsters to be identified and seek the special help and school districts in their inability to fully fund it all. If we really want to help our local schools, then we should fully fund special education so they can free up their local money to do the things that they could do more efficiently at the local level. Mr. Regula. Thank you. Questions? [The information follows:] [GRAPHIC(S) NOT AVAILABLE IN TIFF FORMAT] Ms. Pelosi. Mr. Chairman, since many of our witnesses today are senior Members of Congress, and Mr. Honda is a freshman, he alluded to his experience as a school principal, but, for the record, I wanted him to tell you how he knows of what he speaks as a very distinguished record as an administrator and a teacher in the San Jose area. Mr. Honda. Thank you, Ms. Pelosi. Mr. Chairman, I have spent over 15 years as an administrator in a K-8 school in South Central San Jose, and I know that we tell our parents what their rights are, and a lot of times, in the community I worked with, we had to be their advocates in order to be able to identify these youngsters. Many times school districts are so strapped that they are hesitant to go all the way, because they have to look at their bottom line. We put them in this situation that is untenable for both the districts and we frustrate our parents because they want the best for their youngsters, as do the schools. In other sections of our valley, parents do know their rights and they bring lawyers with them to the school districts. That creates, again, another situation where it is untenable for both sides. So if we solve this problem, we will solve the problem not only for the poor neighborhoods, who where administrators need to be the advocates of the youngsters, and also the well-to-do neighborhoods, where parents have the wherewithal to bring attorneys with them, and we can solve that problem by fully funding a mandate that we have put forward a few years ago. Ms. Pelosi. Mr. Chairman, our witness also brings impressive academic credentials from graduate studies at Stanford University in education. Mr. Honda. I get it. Mr. Regula. Thank you. Mr. Sherwood. Mr. Sherwood. Mr. Honda, as a 20-year school board member, I have great respect for your credentials as a principal and know how important that is. IDEA is something that we have to step up to, because we have created the mandate, but not put the funding with it. So I certainly agree with you on that, and the Pell grants, and a lot of your presentation. But when you talk about the Federal Government providing 100,000 new teachers or reducing the student-teacher ratio, doesn't that go against what you said earlier, that if we provide the IDEA funds, then the districts have the right to run, the ability to run their own deal? I am very pro-education then and I agree with you, but I think there are things we can do from Washington and things we shouldn't try to do from Washington. Mr. Honda. I agree with you, Mr. Sherwood. I was aschool board member for over 9 years in San Jose unified. I understand how budgets are dealt with. You are caught in the middle really as a school board, isn't that correct? At the Federal Government level, you know, the 100,000 teachers was an effort by the Federal Government to help reduce class sizes in many classrooms across the country. I think that is a good role for the Federal Government to do, to encourage the reduction of class size, and also to find funds to be able to compensate teachers who are teaching in high need areas and who are teaching in subject matters that are subject matters that we need, like math and science. Now, today we are talking about accountability, and if we are talking about accountability, then we have to also be accountable by fulfilling our obligation and fully funding that mandate. We are also talking about student achievement. Now, student achievement is obtained by having time on task, and the way we attain time on task in our role can be to help reduction of class size and encourage that, and we can fully help the local school districts if we fund fully special education. That frees up an incredible amount of monies that can be reinvested in reduction of class sizes and hiring new teachers. But when we do that, Mr. Sherwood, you know when we reduce class sizes, we create a need for more teachers. So we need to help support that effort and do just our part so until they get on their feet. The other thing is when we create more teachers, we need the classrooms when we reduce class size. If we don't do those two things, in addition to in our effort to reduce class size and to increase student achievement, if we don't help in the construction of new classrooms, providing new teachers, then we are only going one-third of the way. The other way we can help the local school districts is to free up the local money so they can reinvest that in those areas also. So we need to help school districts be able to provide new construction or modernize by putting up the $25 billion for the tax credit, because at the local level, when we create a bond indebtedness, we are in there for 30 years, right? If we come up with a tax credit against the interest on the principal, that reduces the local effort by 10, sometimes 15 or 20 years, and that is a big impact that is not really well seen by the general public. But we do know that, because we have been involved in that kind of dynamics of budgeting. So the Federal Government has a very unique role, but a very important role, to help attain accountability, student achievement, by helping the local classroom achieve that time on task by creating, hiring more teachers in those needed areas and providing the funds to create more classrooms or modernize classrooms. Mr. Sherwood. We agree and we disagree. Mr. Regula. Thank you, Mr. Honda. Mr. Honda. I am trying to give a macro-picture along with the details. Mr. Regula. Thank you. Mr. Honda. Thank you very much. Let me close, Mr. Chairman, by reiterating what some of the other folks said. I do think we need to start looking at more brain research. That is one area we haven't paid a lot of attention to. Youngsters do come with developing minds and brains. If we look at minds as one set, we have to look at the brain and its development in the process of education. The last comment is we are getting close to senior prom, graduation, and you know as well as I do that we see tragedy in our newspapers about youngsters dying behind the wheels, not because of drugs, not because of alcohol, but because of fatigue. I would just like to reiterate if there is some way we can admonish our schools to talk to our youngsters about taking care of themselves and not get overly tired so that they avoid those tragedies. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. Mr. Regula. Good point. Mr. Bereuter. ---------- Tuesday, April 3, 2001. APPROPRIATION FOR THE UNIVERSITY OF NEBRASKA--LINCOLN AND FUNDING FOR THE CLOSE UP FOUNDATION WITNESS HON. DOUG BEREUTER, A REPRESENTATIVE IN CONGRESS FROM THE STATE OF NEBRASKA Mr. Bereuter. Mr. Chairman, Ms. Pelosi, Mr. Sherwood, members, thank you for letting me testify today. May I observe the Chairman loose, unusually rested and tan, and I am not quite sure how he did it, but I know how he got his tan, because I was with him. I am here to testify, Mr. Chairman, and members of the subcommittee, on two items, an appropriation for the University of Nebraska--Lincoln, and funding of the Close Up Foundation. The first item is the Great Plains Software Technology Initiative. A substantial amount of detail is given about this program. It is, in some ways, a unique program, but I think it is replicable across the whole country. It takes a look at the importance of information technology, attempts oh to help our students cope with it; to use it well as a building block for their future. The program at the University is the result of an $18 million grant from one of our alumni, a challenge grant, and this would provide an opportunity for some internship programs as these students in their educational experience in this honors program implement the curriculum with industry applying what they are learning in the process as they approach the junior and senior year. This will provide an opportunity for additional students, but, most importantly, it helps develop further the curriculum which is replicablearound the country. It is an important initiative. I took a look at the whole range of proposals from the University of Nebraska systems, including this campus, which is in my district, and decided this was the one that I thought had the greatest opportunity for replicability around the country for its application. Secondly, I want to speak about the Close Up Foundation, as I usually do. They have a request for $1.5 million, which is almost below the area where you observe it. But I think it is an important testimony to the corporate world that provides most of the funds for the fellowships for low income students that the Federal Government and the Congress, specifically, thinks this is an important program. When I first came here, Nebraska was one of only seven States that did not participate, although I was speaking to teachers and student groups, and today Steve Janger, the president and founder, tells me that we have the highest participation rate on a per-capita basis in the country. I just spent about 45 minutes this morning speaking to students from my district. It is, in my judgment, the most outstanding citizen education program that brings people to Washington of any age group, and this happens to be a course focused than our high school juniors and seniors. I, along with Mr. Roemer, I believe, who also takes a lead on helping the Close Up Foundation, interested in making sure that this program which focuses on the Federal Government, a national program, is not block granted, that it maintains its separate identity through the authorization process, where Mrs. Landrieu is working in the Senate and where various House Members are taking a lead to make sure the Close Up Foundation's programs continue. Mr. Chairman, thank you very much for listening to my request. I would be happy to answer any questions you may have. [The information follows:] [GRAPHIC(S) NOT AVAILABLE IN TIFF FORMAT] Mr. Regula. Thank you. Mr. Sherwood. Mr. Sherwood. Thank you. Mr. Regula. Thank you. Mr. Dreier. This is a switch. I am usually on the other side of the table with you. ---------- Tuesday, April 3, 2001. RE: DIABETES RESEARCH WITNESS HON. DAVID DREIER, A REPRESENTATIVE IN CONGRESS FROM THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA Mr. Dreier. It is very nice to be here. Mr. Chairman, let me begin by extending very hearty congratulations to Mr. Sherwood on his recent appointment to this very important committee, and obviously the great intelligence that all of you had in placing him on your subcommittee. I want to congratulate you also, because I have spent the last 30 minutes or so listening to the testimony, and you have very important work with which you deal, and this is the first time I have been before this subcommittee, and I appreciate it. It is interesting, if 10 days ago someone had said to me that I was going to be testifying on diabetes funding before Ralph and his subcommittee, I would have said, well, that is interesting, but I was--really would be a little skeptical about it. A week ago Sunday night, many people watched something that took place in the area that I am privileged to represent, the Academy Awards, and I happened to see an old friend of mine, a guy called Doug Wick, accept the Oscar for the best motion picture. He produced Gladiator. Doug and I had been friends for 25 years, but, quite frankly, we had lost contact, and I have been very good friends with his parents, whom I mentioned to you the other day, Charles Wick, who is director of the U.S. Information Agency in the Reagan Administration, and Doug's mother, who was the chairman of the Reagan inaugurals in the 1980s, and I maintained contact with them, but frankly had not been in touch with Doug. But when Doug won this academy award, I decided to call him and congratulate him, and we had a nice chat, and he informed me that his daughter, Tessa, had 3 years ago--she is now 10--3 years ago had been diagnosed with juvenile diabetes, and he asked that I come before you to strongly support the funding that has been provided, and I am very happy that the President has doubled the budget for NIH, and we have also had a significant increase I know for diabetes funding, due in large part to your efforts, and I want to encourage that. What I would like to do is I would like to just read highlights of a letter that Lucy and Doug Wick's daughter, Tessa, wrote recently to a number of people, encouraging support for diabetes funding. I have a longer version which I would like to put in the record. Mr. Regula. Without objection. Mr. Dreier. As I said, she has politics in her veins with her grandparents, so she has a much longer version, but I am going to take the somewhat briefer version. I was rather moved by this. I haven't even met Tessa. I look forward to meeting her.But Doug encouraged me to be here, so let me just share this with you. ``January 15th, 1998, was a day I will never forget. It was the worst day of my life. I was at school in second grade when right before lunch my parents rushed through the door and told my teacher I would have to leave. I could tell by the look on their faces that they were not taking me to Disneyland. Instead, they drove me to the UCLA hospital. ``When I got to the hospital, the doctors told me I had diabetes. They said that I would have to get 2 or 3 shots every single day. I was used to maybe 1 shot every year. And there was more bad news. I was going to have to prick my finger 4 or 5 times a day and put a drop of blood into a little computer. I was going to have to do this before every meal, before bed, and maybe even in the middle of the night. So far, according to my sister's calculations, I have had to prick myself or inject myself with insulin over 4,500 times, and I have had diabetes for a year and a half. ``And then there was this creepy information about what I could eat. For instance, everyone likes to trade food at lunch, but unless I want to have an extra shot, which is usually never, I have to stay away from cheesecake, slurpies and cookies. I don't know if you are a big lunch trader, but I am, and take it from me, what is the use of trading food if you can't win any of the good stuff? ``Sometimes I try and remember what it was like to just eat whatever I wanted without taking a shot of insulin. I try and remember all the nights that I could just go to sleep without worrying about having a seizure in the middle of the night and making my mom wake up at 2 in the morning to check my blood sugar just in case. ``The last 2 summers I have gone to diabetes camp. The first day the camp director stood up and said, will anybody here with diabetes please raise your hands? And every single kid and all the staff members raised their hands. I couldn't believe it. Then the director said, I guess anybody here with diabetes will be the normal ones, and everyone clapped. ``I like feeling normal at camp. But where I really wanted to feel normal is at home, at school, and with my friends, and that is only going to happen one way, and that way is to find a cure. So please support diabetes funding and help us find a cure. ``Thank you very much, Tessa Wick.'' Obviously no one could say it any more eloquently than Tessa did in this letter, Mr. Chairman. But I just want to congratulate you and encourage you to proceed with funding for this very important effort to find a cure for diabetes. Mr. Regula. Thank you. I have a young lady in my district whose parents brought her to visit with me in the office, an identical situation. You really reach out to these young people. We hope to find something. We are going to commit as much in the way of resources as we can to this. Mr. Dreier. Thank you very much. I will convey that word to the Wicks for you. [The information follows:] [GRAPHIC(S) NOT AVAILABLE IN TIFF FORMAT] Mr. Regula. Give my best to Charles. He did a terrific job at USIA. I worked with him. Of course, Mrs. Wick was active with the Ford Theater. Mr. Dreier. Right. She still is. Mr. Regula. She still is. That is a great program there. Mr. Sherwood. Mr. Sherwood. It is bad enough with adult onset diabetes, but to think a child is looking forward to their whole life with this insidious disease, tell your young lady that her testimony was very compelling and we will pay attention. Mr. Dreier. Thank you very much, Don. I will try to be as nice to you all when you come before the Rules Committee as you have been to me today. Mr. Regula. We will keep that promise in hand. Mr. Dreier. I said I will try. Mr. Regula. Okay, Mr. Roemer. Mr. Roemer. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. Congratulations again on your ascension to the most important, in my estimation, of many of the important subcommittee chairmanships. As a member of the education committee, we look to you to fund many of our suggestions, but also to work in a bipartisan way with you on cooperative projects. Mr. Regula. We await your bill with interest. Mr. Roemer. We are working in a bipartisan way to try to report an ESEA bill to you. Congratulations to Mr. Sherwood on his elevation to this important committee. I ask unanimous consent to have my entire statement entered into the record. Mr. Regula. Without objection. ---------- Tuesday, April 3, 2001. RE: TRANSITION TO TEACHING WITNESS HON. TIM ROEMER, A REPRESENTATIVE IN CONGRESS FROM THE STATE OF INDIANA Mr. Roemer. My good friend, Mr. Dreier, talked about the Academy Awards. One of the parts that you may have seen, if you watched, Mr. Chairman, was that they wanted to keep the testimony as short as possible. I am sure you are looking for some of that in your time here. They were going to award a high definition television to those people that kept their testimony short. While I don't pretend to be any Julia Roberts, I might have more success between the two gentleman here in the room if I was for the three or four actual projects that I am going to ask your cooperation for. I will try to keep my testimony short, although I don't certainly have the---- Mr. Regula. You won't get a television, but you will get our appreciation. Mr. Roemer. Okay. I will try to get the appreciation and the support for my projects. Certainly the Preventing Child Neglect and Delinquency Program with the University of Notre Dame is important. The Ivy Tech College Machine Tool Training Apprenticeship Program, where we are trying to train more people in manufacturing jobs is very important in my district as we go through some rough layoffs. As Mr. Bereuter testified about the importance of the Close Up Program, that is a program that I have been involved in for my 10 years here in Congress. Steve Janger does a great job running that program, and they bring a host of minority students into Washington, D.C. for civic education. I hope you will continue to show your strong support for that. I am testifying here for a program that we started last year for the first time, Transition to Teaching. We provided in the appropriation billion dollars 31 million for this appropriation, and I would encourage your subcommittee to fund it once again. Imagine, Mr. Chairman, if you have a 17-year-old son or daughter, sending them to school, and you are going to try to encourage your son or daughter to maybe take an honors class in physics and go to Ohio State University. And that physics teacher is not certified in physics, but certified in physical education. Imagine if you have a second grader going to school and they are having difficulty reading, and we are having a teacher who is not certified in teaching reading in their first year who is not comfortable with the format, the subject matter or the inclusion of technology into the curriculum. Many of our first year teachers are in that position. We are going to have to hire 2 million new teachers in the next 10 years, many of which will fall into the situations that I have just outlined for you, in the second grade or as juniors in high school. We have this transition to teaching program that follows up on the very, very successful troops to teachers program that was instigated in 1994. We brought people from the military into the teaching profession. Many of them were trained in science and technology and math. Eighty three percent of them are still teaching in high need areas, in high need schools, and now we have followed on with the transition to teaching program where we are rewarding universities and not-for- positive profits to train the next generation of teachers in math, science, technology areas, to come into our schools in mid-career, at 45 or 50 years old, and teach in these subject matters in high need areas. This is a program that is going to work very well, that is hopefully going to address some of our need for the 2 million new teachers, although it is not the silver bullet by itself, and I hope you will continue to fund this program. Thank you for the testimony today. [The information follows:] [GRAPHIC(S) NOT AVAILABLE IN TIFF FORMAT] Mr. Regula. Thank you. I assume that there will be hopefully a lot of military retirees that will participate. Mr. Roemer. There will be some, Mr. Chairman. That has actually slowed down since 1994, with some of the attrition and some of the military people leaving now. We are doing everything we can to try to keep some of those people and retain them, and we are looking outside the military to follow up on the troops to teachers with this transition to teaching program. Mr. Regula. Mr. Sherwood. Mr. Sherwood. Thank you. Mr. Roemer. Thank you. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. ---------- Tuesday, April 3, 2001 FUNDING REQUESTS FOR EDUCATION, LABOR, AND HHS PROGRAMS WITNESS HON. MAXINE WATERS, A REPRESENTATIVE IN CONGRESS FROM THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA Mr. Regula. Ms. Waters. Ms. Waters. Good morning. Thank you very much, Mr. Chairman and members, for sitting in those seats for the hours that you have to sit to hear all of the testimony that comes before this committee and a particular thanks for the time that you are giving to all of the Members today. I am delighted to be here. I will go into a few of my requests. Mine are not as program specific as they are general in nature, and I have broken them down into the three areas that you have oversight responsibility for: Education, health and human services, and the labor issues. Mr. Regula. We will put your entire statement in the record. Ms. Waters. Thank you very much. On education I am hopeful that this Congress will be known as the Education Congress. We have all talked a lot about education, and there is some confusion about how much increase we are going to have in this education budget. I certainly hope that it is in the neighborhood of 11 percent or more rather than the 4 or 5 percent I keep hearing alluded to. Under education, educational technology is very important. This includes programs such as the Technology Literacy Challenge Fund. There is a digital divide, and if we are to prepare young people for the future, particularly in some of the poor communities, we must make sure that they have access to computers and new technology. So I think that we should not have any cuts in that area. Teacher training is extremely important. I was at a teacher training program this past weekend that was done by my local school district where they have the teachers, the administrators and the parents all together, and teacher training, mastering English for many of the immigrant students and students who are coming from other places, and I thought it was very, very effective. We have got to put money into teacher training programs. School modernization. Without a doubt we have schools that are falling apart. The air conditioning does not work, the heating systems are broken, graffiti on walls, the toilets not working. And so I think again if we are to be the Education Congress, we have got to make sure that we modernize our schools and buy some new schools because we have expanding populations that cannot accommodate the growth in many of these areas. After school programs such as the 21st Century Learning Centers, very important. Many of our schools could help out with the problems of the entire community if they had after school programs, programs that gave additional support to what is going on in the classrooms during the day, and I think we have talked about that a lot and we have these facilities that are sitting there and we should put them to good use. Let me move on to Health and Human Services. Numerous studies have demonstrated that minorities are disproportionately impacted by a variety of health problems. The National Institutes of Health is collaborating on 12 5-year projects to research how social and environmental factors contribute to the desperate health problems of racial and ethnic minorities. Cardiovascular disease, the death rate in 1998 for African Americans attributable to heart disease was 136.3 per 100,000 people compared to 95.1 per 100,000 for others. In cancer the Centers for Disease Control are currently allocated 174,000 for breast and cervical cancer screening. African American women have the highest death rate from cervical cancer. African American women have breast cancer rate similar to other women but die at greater numbers from preventable disease. Women should not be dying from breast cancer, but we need to have more research in those areas. You have heard probably a lot about AIDS. The Congressional Black Caucus has spent a lot of time on creating additional funding in this category of AIDS because of the alarming increases in HIV and AIDS in the African American community. I would ask this committee to pay special attention to that funding and the special category that we worked so hard for to help build capacity in minority communities, in poor communities that don't have the capability of dealing with outreach and prevention and all of that. Mr. Regula. We were at the CDC yesterday, Centers for Disease Control, and they made emphasis on that very point that you are making. Ms. Waters. Thank you so very much. It is extremely important. I won't go into the death rates. I will talk about diabetes that has been mentioned here a lot today. I want to tell you that I am watching too many people lose limbs and die from diabetes. They are cutting off arms and--well, feet and legs in particular, and people are going blind from diabetes. We need a lot of money in prevention and outreach so people can understand the symptoms of this disease and how to care for themselves. People are dying at a very early age. Mr. Regula. They made a good point yesterday that a lot of times people don't recognize it early enough and the impact on the body is already pretty progressive before it is recognized. Ms. Waters. That is right, Mr. Chairman. They refer to it as the silent killer because by the time many people get there, their bodies are already overcome by all that goes along with it and we need health care prevention for all of America, everywhere. Mr. Regula. I agree with that. Ms. Waters. So we don't learn until, you know, after we get 50 and things start falling apart. Then we get very conscious about our health. But I sure would have liked to have known a lot of this when I was a lot younger. In education also I wanted to mention Head Start. I worked in Head Start when Head Start first was originated. I was the supervisor parent involved in voluntary services, and of course I learned a lot about how parents and communities can be in control of the children's educational destiny. There is not a lot that I need to say about Head Start. I think everybody recognizes that it is a wonderful program that needs full funding, and to the degree we do that we have prepared children for school and they are prepared to read, et cetera. In labor, I want to mention Job Corps. Job Corps is very important and they really have done a very good job. I am concerned that we still have Job Corps programs that don't have the residential component. That is extremely important when you take these kids into Job Corps. If, for example, in Los Angeles, where we have a big Job Corps program, some of them have to go back to their communities at night, we lose them, or the influence of the community is so great that in one program they change clothes. For example, they wear one set of clothes while they are in the Job Corps, but when they go back to their communities they have to wear another set of clothes to identify with the neighborhoods that they come from. We would like to see more residential facilities associated so that by the time they transition out, they are into jobs, they are going to live on their own so they don't have to go back to those communities. The veterans employment and training I can't say enough about that. I have a program in my district. This is very important because they take the homeless veterans off the street, and they have a program that is designed to get them back into the main stream and they live in this facility while they are being trained and they are doing jobs. And many of them go on from there again to have their own homes and to live a full life and off the street and using their talent. And so these are just some of the things that I wanted to quickly mention in the short period of time that we have here today, and I appreciate your attention to these matters. [The information follows:] [GRAPHIC(S) NOT AVAILABLE IN TIFF FORMAT] Mr. Regula. Thank you. Mr. Sherwood. Mr. Sherwood. Thank you very much. Mr. Regula. I would like to visit with you on Head Start, but I will catch you on the floor. Ms. Waters. That is my favorite subject any time. Mr. Regula. I would like to talk with you about it and see how you suggest ways to making it even more effective. But I will find you there. We have one more witness. Ms. Waters. Thank you. ---------- Tuesday, April 3, 2001. FUNDING REQUESTS FOR FAR ROCKAWAY PENINSULA PROGRAMS IN QUEENS, NEW YORK WITNESS HON. GREGORY W. MEEKS, A REPRESENTATIVE IN CONGRESS FROM THE STATE OF NEW YORK Mr. Regula. Mr. Meeks. Mr. Meeks. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. I ask unanimous consent for my statement to be in the record in its entirety. Mr. Regula. Without objection. Mr. Meeks. Mr. Chairman, Mr. Sherwood, I thank you for this opportunity to present testimony to you today. And I will be succinct. Let me first, I come to talk about a specific program within my district. And we are asking for a mere $2 million earmarked to the Joseph P. Addabbo Family Health Care Center. Mr. Regula. I knew Joe well, good man. Mr. Meeks. He was a great man who did a lot in the community that I now represent, and this particular health care center we named after him because he really started it while he was here in Congress. And it deals with the part of the district that is probably the most isolated part of New York City, of all of New York City. It is a peninsula that is about 24 miles outside of downtown Manhattan. And many individuals who have to live on that peninsula, they are subject to just the services that are there. They don't have access to what we call the mainland, which is the other part of New York City, and that is just how difficult it is because of the transportation to the mainland if you happen to live on the peninsula. As you may know, the Joseph P. Addabbo Family Health Care Center is a private, nonprofit, federally funded community health center that was established in 1987 to provide comprehensive health services to the poor and medically indigent and or medically underserved residents of the Rockaway peninsula. The Rockaway peninsula ranked 14th among the 58 neighborhoods in the city for severe health-related problems in 1995 and 1996, the years for which the most recent data is available, with the rate of preventable hospital admissions more than 50 percent above the city average in 1996. This is an area home to the sickest and poorest segments of all of New York City, and this project that we are talking about is a joint project. It is a joint health and educational project that we are looking to develop on the peninsula. The Joseph P. Addabbo Family Health Care Center participated in a Robert Wood Johnson-funded needs assessment in the peninsula's low income communities. This project was designed to identify primary health care needs. As a result of this assessment, Far Rockaway has been designated a health crisis area by the Health Systems Agency of New York City. Another important aspect of the health profile of the Rockaway peninsula is a greater portion of its residents are children, with 38 percent of the population below 20 years of age. The large number of children and the high level of risk factors present in the community warrant particular attention to the needs of the children and young adolescents. Twenty-nine percent of the children live below the poverty level. Academic achievement levels in schools range near the bottom, with 54 percent of the students reading below their grade level and 44 scoring below their grade level in mathematics. There is also a high incidence of pregnancy among teenagers. In fact, it is 14.5 percent higher than all of the Borough of Queens, and New York City's average is only 8 percent. And most of these are young adults between the ages of 15 and 18 years old. The AIDS rate has been growing much faster than the growth rate increase of 82 percent from 1990 to 1991. Now this project is something that is a conglomerative. We have several different parts of the community that are engaged in helping this, and what we are trying to do is to get our Federal portion of it funded. For example, the New York City Housing Authority has invested $1.5 million into the project. The New York City Council has put in $1.1 million for it. The New York State Assembly has put in $500,000. The Borough President of Queens has put $2 million. York College, a local college within the district, is putting $500,000 into this. And the College of Aeronautics is putting another $500,000 in this. So this becomes for the peninsula a mass educational and health care facility that will cover some 104,000 people that currently live on the peninsula who are isolated from other parts of the city. So we just come asking to bring in our Federal share and ask for whatever consideration this committee could give us in getting an earmark of $2 million. [The information follows:] [GRAPHIC(S) NOT AVAILABLE IN Mr. Regula. Thank you. Mr. Sherwood. Mr. Sherwood. Thank you very much. Mr. Regula. Mr. Addabbo was a senior member of Appropriations. Mr. Meeks. He was. Mr. Regula. And he and I went to Tokyo. I had forgotten. It was quite a while ago. He is not living anymore? Mr. Meeks. No, he is not. He passed away. His family is still very involved in this and through all of his good work we have named this for him. Mr. Regula. You have what was his district or portions of it? Mr. Meeks. Most of it is what he used to represent. He was my Congressman. Mr. Regula. Thank you for bringing this. The subcommittee is adjourned. Tuesday, May 22, 2001. EDUCATION WITNESS LISA GRAHAM KEEGAN, CHIEF EXECUTIVE OFFICER, EDUCATION LEADERS COUNCIL Mr. Regula. Well, we'll get started. We have a number of witnesses this morning, and we need to keep moving, so that everyone has an opportunity to be heard and some time for questions. Our first witness, Bishop Conway, is not here yet, so I think we'll go to Lisa Keegan, the Chief Executive Officer, Education Leaders Council. Mr. Obey, would you like to make any comments here? Mr. Obey. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. I think we might as well get started. We're more interested in hearing what they have to say than what I have to say. Mr. Regula. Okay. Well, we're happy to welcome you. As you know, we have a five-minute rule, so if you'll summarize it will be helpful. Ms. Keegan. I'll do that. Thank you very much, Mr. Chairman. As you said, my name's Lisa Keegan. I am the Chief Executive Officer of the Education Leader's Council. We are a group of reform minded State school chiefs, State board members. We have governors who are members, and we have superintendents, teachers who are members. Our organization believes that reform is necessary in American education, and we have been engaged in that in our States. We believe that most of this will happen in the States. And we appreciate the opportunity to discuss with the Congress the direction that you're going to take in your budget and in the education bills before you. Our organization believes that in fact it is instruction that makes the difference for kids. It is not externals. What matters in a classroom is dependent on high expectation and instruction of a child. And we see going about that in a number of ways, many of which are very innovative in the States. But we do think it's our responsibility to educate the kids, and we're not looking for excuses or external situations to be solved. We don't believe class size is the answer, we don't believe that wealth issues are the answer, we don't believe color of children has anything to do with ability to learn. We feel very strongly that instruction is the answer and the classroom is where this has to happen. I want to talk a little bit about the proposals that have been made on the House budget. I realize many of them have reform components. Oftentimes those of us who talk about reform, it's happening here and we're listening to it, are characterized as not being interested in children or because we want to have a change, that's seen as very hostile. At the Council we try to remain very disciplined in our focus on a few things. One is that our appropriations from the Congress and in the States needs to be focused on the needs of kids and not on the bureaucracies that serve them. They need to as much as possible go directly to the classroom and to the needs of the instruction leader, who is the teacher, usually. Secondly, that oftentimes means that those resources will have to be changed in terms of formula. Where they are needed is in the classroom. Where they are often lobbied for is outside of the classroom, because organizations for education tend to be interested in organizations outside of the classroom. We believe that's problematic. Thirdly, we would like to see that the Congress, in pushing some majorly important ideas, will seek not to strangle so much with regulation but rather to support movement in the direction of strong instruction, strong assessments and product and result for students. We do believe it's absolutely essential to have assessments. You may find our opinion quite different than a lot of the education organizations. We make no apologies for assessments. We are about the business of assessing in our States. We think it's critically important. We think it's fabulous that the President has proposed $320 million in his budget to assist States with their testing programs. However, we also hope that most States are already about this business already. It's critically important to know where our kids are. We do take issue with much that's been said about the cost of assessment. We listened to a number of statements from the National Association of State Boards of Education saying that the cost was $7 billion for testing. That assumes about $125 per student, which we think is nonsense. In our States, where we are running testing programs, the State of Virginia has a very extensive budget that costs $4 per year. They are not testing annually. If they did that, that would double, but it would not be anywhere near this $125 that's being bandied about. In Massachusetts, which exceeds the President's proposal in terms of the frequency of testing and the depth of that testing, their costs are $14 per child. In Arizona, they are about $10 per child. So I would keep that in mind. The exercise ought to be strong but narrow focus on assessment and let the States go beyond if they want to. We feel it's very important to let them determine sort of the extent to which they're going to test, beyond reading and writing and mathematics that's being asked for, which we think is necessary, particularly to prove Title I. We are pleased with the increases to Title I. We think that money should follow students into programs that work for them. That has always been our bottom line. We recognize the desire to try to hold everybody harmless and make sure we're funding everybody last year the way we were, or this year the way we were last year because of political reasons. We would encourage you to let that money follow kids. Kids and parents will find successful programs and those programs should prosper because of it. We do support the money for teacher quality. We think it's very important to keep that flexible. There are a number of very, very innovative teacher quality programs going on, depending on the needs of States. Our States, our member States, have everything from Troops to Teachers to the teacher advancement programs, all sorts of innovative programs. We also hope you will continue support for choice. Our organization is a strong believer in school choice. We think all options that work for kids ought to be made available to them. And as State school chiefs, we support that. You find that might be unusual from time to time, coming from State school chiefs. We believe any school that's working well for a child is one worth investigation as to whether or not they'll be able to go there, and we're pleased that that discussion is ongoing in the Congress. Thank you very much, Mr. Chairman. [The justification follows:] [GRAPHIC(S) NOT AVAILABLE IN TIFF FORMAT] Mr. Regula. Did you have any input with the authorizing committee on the bill that's on the Floor this week? And if so, have you looked at it and do you agree with most of it? Ms. Keegan. Mr. Chairman, we have had input on that bill, which we appreciate. We like very much the President's original No Child Left Behind idea. We feel it's had to be compromised, we understand that. We support very much the emphasis on assessment. We would like to see that simplified a little bit, so that the States are looking at gain of all kids and that we don't make it so complicated that it fails in its implementation. We would like to see some of the amendments on flexibility and choice come on. It's very important for the members to recognize that any time there's a program, we have a requirement then to staff that program in our departments of education with X number of people, and it makes it very difficult to focus when you have to be maintaining dozens of different programs. We would like to be able to focus on our standards and assessment programs. Mr. Regula. Mr. Obey. Mr. Obey. As you know, the President has proposed under his plan that NAEP be used as a second check on the annual assessments. However, the bill before the House today allows States to use other tests that might not be as rigorous as NAEP. With which position do you agree, the President or the bill as it's before the House today? Ms. Keegan. Mr. Chairman and Representative Obey, we are fans of the NAEP test at the Education Leaders Council. We use it. We believe it is strong. We understand the concern that you could slide into a situation where you are sort of mandating a national tests that States have a discomfort with. Our concern is that we know the NAEP well, we understand it, we think the standards are rigorous. We would not look forward to having a requirement for a test that was not in line with our own standards. So any language that allows for an alternative, which we understand the need for, we hope will maintain the same kind of rigor that is present in the NAEP. We are big supporters of OERE, OERI and the research arm in the Department and of NAGBE, which sponsors the NAEP tests. It's something all of us have a great deal of confidence in right now. Mr. Obey. You prefer the NAEP, rather than some substitute as a second check? Ms. Keegan. Mr. Chairman, Mr. Obey, we prefer the NAEP in our organization. That does not mean that we don't understand there could be a need for something down the road. So all I'm saying is, to the extent there's going to be an alternative, we would like for that to be extremely tight in its language. I think we all have reason to be quite confident in the NAEP. Most of us are using its statistics right now when we talk about how the country is doing. So if we had to decide between one or the other, the NAEP or any series of tests that might not be of the same quality, we would go just with the NAEP. Mr. Regula. Mr. Jackson. Mr. Jackson. I have no questions, Mr. Chairman. Mr. Regula. One last question. We're going to have an amendment on the education bill on the President's suggestion on vouchers, or if the school is failing, the children have a choice. How does your group feel about that? The language was in the President's original bill. Ms. Keegan. Correct. Mr. Chairman, we support that. We don't believe any child should be in a school that's failing. There are options available for these children. We believe the first priority is to have a child in the classroom with a teacher that's going to move that child. We realize these are difficult decisions for lots of people, but for us, it's an easy decision. We want that child educated and in any way we can find to do that, we will be supportive of. Mr. Regula. Do you like the Troops to Teachers program? Ms. Keegan. Mr. Chairman, we do. Most of our States are using it. We've had a great deal of success with it. When I was the chief in Arizona, we had great success with that program and Teach for America, and any number of alternative entryways into teaching. Mr. Regula. I'm curious, you take this retiree from the military, did you require that they go back to school and go through the hoops to get certification that you normally have to do? Ms. Keegan. Mr. Chairman, no, and that's what's interesting about these alternative programs. They do go through preparation in instruction and classroom management. There are some tests to determine content knowledge. That's similar to Teach for America, another project that brings in very young graduates and puts them in inner city schools, which has been very successful. We believe there are several ways to prepare very strong teachers and make them qualified. There does have to be an instruction, but probably not the traditional route. Mr. Regula. Well, thank you very much. Mr. Jackson. Mr. Jackson. I think I do have a question, just one. At least as I understand the nature of our education system in the country, we have, based upon the way our country has evolved, 50 separate and unequal States, 3,068 separate and unequal counties, and at least as many separate and unequal cities. Many States derive their revenue from agricultural economy, others derive them from a service based economy, others derive them from an industrial based economy, which only exacerbates the nature of that inequality. So for the 53 million children in public schools across the country who find themselves in the 85,000 separate and unequal schools in the 15,000 separate and unequal school districts, I'm wondering how your programs overcome those limitations, and how the vast majority of those children who find themselves in those unequal schools are reached? Ms. Keegan. Mr. Chairman, Representative Jackson, we think this is a huge concern. In fact, it's a concern that a lot of people don't like to address. That is the fact that public education in its traditional form segregates by wealth, because it relies on a property tax base and a boundary by which to serve children. So it doesn't so much keep children within a neighborhood as it keeps other children out. We believe that the solutions to this need to be generated by the State, but that they ought to be generated by coming up with funding formulas wherein money follows students, into school that work for them, that funding probably ought to be more generated by shared taxes rather than just local property taxes. And as you know, there is a wealth of political fallout when you start to talk about changing district basis for education. So it is a local-State issue, it is very difficult. I think there are 25 States right now, Representatives, thatare engaged in a sort of Supreme Court argument over this very issue. It's something that our organization has been involved in at the State level and will continue to be, because we think there's a moral imperative. Mr. Jackson. Does your organization believe that every child deserves the right to an equal, high quality education? Ms. Keegan. Mr. Chairman, Representative Jackson, yes, sir. Mr. Jackson. Is there any way for us to guarantee that every child gets such a right without the idea of education as a fundamental right being part of our constitution? Ms. Keegan. Mr. Chairman, Representative Jackson, I'm not quite sure that it isn't at least a moral imperative as part of what we do. Obviously that has not been part of the constitution overall. It has been part of implementation in every State. I don't see that changing. I think most people are dedicated to that ideal. We have tripped ourselves up in its implementation, we believe, and we just have to address that without pointing fingers at why that happened. Mr. Jackson. I thank you. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. Mr. Regula. Mr. Obey. Mr. Obey. Mr. Chairman, I just can't help but observe, it's very interesting that the bill before the House today would withhold education funding from States if children are not tested annually. For instance, if Wisconsin decided to test on math in odd numbered grades, and decided to test on reading in even numbered grades, money would be withheld from the State for exercising that judgment. But money would not be withheld from States if they have outrageous differences in the dollars per child in say, Maple School District in my district versus Maple Bluff, where they spend almost twice as much money. I find that an interesting focus on the hole in the doughnut. Mr. Regula. I think our witness would agree with you, but we're going to have to move on. ---------- Tuesday, May 22, 2001. LIHEAP WITNESS THE MOST REVEREND EDWIN M. CONWAY, AUXILIARY BISHOP OF THE ARCHDIOCESE OF CHICAGO Mr. Regula. We're pleased to call Bishop Conway, the Bishop of the Archdiocese of Chicago. Mr. Jackson, I understand you'll introduce our guest. Mr. Jackson. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. Mr. Obey. Where is Chicago? [Laughter.] Mr. Jackson. Somewhere sandwiched between Ohio and Wisconsin. Mr. Regula. It's the new home of the Boeing Company. Mr. Jackson. When our bill comes before the Committee, I want both of you to remember that. Mr. Regula. I said it's the new home of the Boeing Company. Mr. Jackson. Yes, sir, it certainly is. Mr. Chairman, I am honored today to introduce the Most Reverend Edwin M. Conway, who was ordained a priest on May 6th, 1960, and ordained a bishop on March 20th, 1995. Currently, Bishop Conway serves as the Episcopal Vicar for Vicariate Number Two of the Archdiocese, which includes supervision of 63 parishes on the north and northwest side of Cook County, Illinois. Bishop Conway serves as the liaison for the Health Affairs Office of the Archdiocese, which oversees 23 Catholic health care centers and long term health care facilities of the Archdiocese. He has served as an associate pastor and in various roles of service and management within the Catholic Charities system and the Archdiocese of Chicago. Bishop Conway was the administrator of Catholic Charities from 1980 through 1997, and served as the director for the Archdiocese of Chicago and was a member of the Cardinal's Cabinet from 1985 through 1997. Bishop Conway holds a masters degree in theology and a masters degree in social work from Loyola University in Chicago. Mr. Chairman, and members of the Subcommittee, I present to you Bishop Conway. Bishop Conway. Thank you. Mr. Regula. Thank you. We're happy to welcome you, and look forward to your comments. Your testimony will be made part of the record. Bishop Conway. Good morning, Chairman Regula and thank you, Mr. Jackson, for the invitation to come and also for your introduction this morning. And good morning also to the members of the Committee that are here before us. We have written testimony, I'd like to submit that and just spend briefly, some four or five minutes here discussing some of the high points of that testimony. Thank you for the invitation to speak to you this morning regarding the Low Income Home Energy Assistance Program, LIHEAP. I am an Auxiliary Bishop from the Archdiocese of Chicago. Cardinal George was asked, as the Archbishop of Chicago, to come and testify this morning. Fortunately orunfortunately, he has been called to Rome for a Consistory of the Cardinals along with Pope John Paul II and has asked me to speak on his behalf for the Archdiocese of Chicago. As you will see from my resume, I've spent more than 30 years with the Catholic Charities of the Archdiocese of Chicago. Many of those years I spent as its administrator. Thus, I speak from my own experience as well as a bishop in Chicago which oversees some 67 parishes, serving multi-ethnic and multi-racial communities. The Archdiocese of Chicago has 377 parishes, with approximately three-quarters of a million active parishioners. This morning I wish to speak to you specifically about the Low Income Home Energy Assistance Program. I fervently urge you to appropriate at least $2.3 billion in core funding for the LIHEAP program for the fiscal year 2002. The overall totals, you recall, last year were $2.3 billion and were made available to all the States in order to help low income families with home energy problems. Illinois received approximately $132 million and it was supplemented by an additional $65 million in State grants. This money came from various sources within State supplemental low income assistance funds. The program in Chicago was administered through the Community Economic Development Association of Cook County, which serves the household of elderly disabled and others who are disconnected or meet the poverty guidelines. In Illinois, approximately 775,00 households are eligible for low income below this level. Currently, Peoples Gas in Chicago records approximately 25,000 elderly and disabled with heating bills that are significantly or substantially past due. I point this out as it comes time when gas prices have more than doubled. The energy bills will not return to the 2000 year level in the foreseeable future, which gives us an example of the Archdiocese itself, which purchases gas at approximately 60 percent less value from NICOR and Peoples Gas in Chicago. Based upon that usage, however, of the present and past heating seasons, an additional $8 million will be required of the Archdiocese in payments in the year to come. This will severely decrease the amount of discretionary dollars that the parishes and pastors will have to distribute to poor clients who are experiencing eminent shut-off of the utilities. I point out that in the week prior to April 4th, the deadline for gas shut-off in Chicago, the Archdiocese of Chicago Catholic Charities received more than 300 requests for energy assistance over the past several months. They have received more than 500 requests regarding utility assistance. The average bill for heating in Illinois in the area of Chicago is $1,500. The State assistance LIHEAP program is $495. This amount is less than one-third of the energy bill going to assist elderly and the vulnerable poor. The Bishops of Illinois have talked about the right to housing for families and their children, and they have sought to estimate the number of households in which families will be experiencing no heat. I therefore strongly believe, and I have been informed by the Catholic Charities of the United States, that the situation nationally, especially in some of the colder States, is also parallel to Illinois. I stress the fact that unless the amount is restored to at least last year's level, more than 50,000 households in the Chicago area will be ineligible this coming year if the current grant remains the same. The facts in this instance are very clear, the dramatic increases in home energy costs, lack of corresponding increases in salaries and income, results certainly and assuredly that families will be unable to meet their bills. Therefore, we implore this Committee to fund LIHEAP for the year 2002 at at least equal to the amounts in the resources that were available to the States for the last winter, or $2.3 billion. And since even this amount may not be adequate to meet the needs of low income families living on the edge of homelessness, we would strongly encourage an appropriate increase over this level in the overall funding. We hope at the very least that if this amount remains as introduced by the Administration, the $300 million be also allocated in an appropriate basis to each State. We know that our brothers and sisters in California have been publicly and visibly shown to have utility problems. We are seeking some sort of the same recognition in Illinois and among our Chicago citizens, who rely on this program to continue to survive. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. And thank you to the members of the Committee for receiving testimony this morning. [The justification follows:] [GRAPHIC(S) NOT AVAILABLE IN TIFF FORMAT] Mr. Regula. Thank you. Mr. Obey. Mr. Obey. Bishop Conway, I don't know if you're aware of it, but Chairman Regula is a member of what is known as the College of Cardinals in the Congress. Bishop Conway. Which means? Mr. Obey. I thank you for reminding him that he doesn't belong to the only College of Cardinals. Mr. Regula. I didn't get summoned to Rome, though. [Laughter.] Mr. Obey. Let me simply ask one question. In your statement, you referred to the need for funding LIHEAP at last year's level of $2.3 billion. I believe what that refers to is that $1.7 billion was made available in the regular 2000 appropriation, plus an additional $556 million was available in carry-over funds, for a total of $2.256 billion. I think it's important for the Committee to understand that if we adopt the President's fiscal year 2002 request, which is $1.7 billion, composed of $1.4 billion in core funds and $300,000 in contingency funds, that States would see a 25 percent reduction in the actual amount of deliverable aid next winter. How many people did you say that would not be served in Illinois? Bishop Conway. In Illinois, we think there will be at least 50,000 households in the Chicago-land area that will not be. And also we know that probably the $2.3 billion is inadequate. It certainly is what we would like you to achieve, but even more is needed if we're going to match the increasing energy bills. Mr. Obey. I certainly agree with that. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. Mr. Regula. Mr. Jackson. Mr. Jackson. Mr. Chairman, I did have a question, but the Bishop spoke to it in his remarks. My district, the Second District of Illinois, receives $12 million of that $76 million in the LIHEAP program. The next closest district receives some $4 million. So I'm very well aware of the benefit that LIHEAP provides, and I think the Bishop's testimony and his extended remarks, when we begin to negotiate over our bill, I certainly hope that the Committee will take into account that there are a number of communities, particularly those who suffer in Chicago winters, who are in desperate need of this program, and any efforts to under-fund the program can only create the kind of misery amongst some Americans that none of us would want in a Chicago winter. So I'm certainly hoping, Mr. Chairman, that you'll be sensitive and the Committee will be sensitive to the Bishop's remarks. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. Mr. Regula. I might say, I think there will be a supplemental emergency appropriation. It will include money for LIHEAP. I know that's in the planning stage. I'm not sure how much yet. But there will be. Mrs. DeLauro. Mrs. DeLauro. I'm delighted to hear that the Chairman thinks there will be a supplemental appropriation. We weren't sure that that was going to be the case. Clearly, LIHEAP is a lifeline for people in our communities where we have tough winters, and those that have tough summers as well, as we've seen in the past. And we need to continue the past efforts with regard to LIHEAP, especially now given the kinds of crises that people are facing in their lives with energy. Thank you. Mr. Regula. As I understand it, you just deal with Chicago? Bishop Conway. That's correct. Mr. Regula. How about the outlying areas? Is that part of another---- Bishop Conway. It's a different diocese. Mr. Regula. Configuration? Bishop Conway. Yes, different diocese. However, we are in communication and we have a statewide organization. The Illinois Catholic Conference, that deals with issues. It's fundamentally the same. In fact, some of the rural areas outside Chicago, which are more devastated economically, are really concerned about facing this. Mr. Regula. Does your diocese administer this program, or just work with individuals to apply for it? Bishop Conway. Yes, it works with the county to distribute the funds. Mr. Regula. What's the policy, pretty much, of the gas companies? Do they shut off if they don't get paid? Bishop Conway. Well, this has been a very sensitive point. We've gone through several public manifestations and demonstrations about this. And currently, it's in abeyance until it is handled in a much better way. There were two due dates set and at both times the gas companies gave a reprieve until some further discussion was done by the local municipalities, county government and hopefully the Federal Government. Mr. Regula. Do you think most people know that this is available and take advantage of it? Because otherwise they could be in a real crisis situation. Bishop Conway. I think most people become aware of it and maybe they're not aware of it at first glance, where they certainly begin to come to the point of having their gas turned off or collaterally through some other arrangement with the social service agency they become aware of this and apply for it. Mr. Regula. I assume the gas company would let them know. Bishop Conway. They do. Mr. Regula. They have an interest, too. Bishop Conway. Right. Mr. Regula. Well, thank you very much for coming and testifying this morning. Bishop Conway. Thank you. ---------- Tuesday, May 22, 2001. WOMEN'S HEALTH WITNESS CAROLYN M. MAZURE, CHAIR, WOMEN'S HEALTH RESEARCH COALITION Mr. Regula. I think Mrs. DeLauro, we'll move then to Carolyn Mazure, the Chair of the Women's Health Research Coalition. You'll be introduced by Mrs. DeLauro. Mrs. DeLauro. Good morning. Mr. Chairman, let me just say thank you to you and to my colleagues. It's such a pleasure to welcome to the Committee a woman whose work I truly do admire greatly, and of whom I'm tremendously proud to count as one of my constituents. Dr. Carolyn Mazure is a professor of psychiatry at the Yale University School of Medicine, the principal investigator for the Donohue Women's Health Investigator Program at Yale. I might add that that is the largest university-wide women's health research program in the United States. Dr. Mazure is a national leader in the field of women's health, conducting research on women and tobacco dependence, post-traumatic stress disorder in determining predictors of depression and psychosis. She serves on the board of the Society of Women's Health Research and in addition to that, she really has been a leader in bringing the work of research on women's health into the community, to look at how we actually try to improve the health and the lives of women across their entire life span. So it's a great honor for me to welcome Dr. Mazure and to be able to say to the Committee, this is someone who really does have an unbelievable grasp of what is happening out there with regard to women's health and research and look forward to her comments on the budget for the next fiscal year, and say thank you to you for spending some time with us, Doctor. Mr. Regula. Thank you. Your entire statement will be put in the record, and we'll appreciate your summarizing. Ms. Mazure. Thank you. First, thank you, Congresswoman DeLauro, for your very kind words of introduction. It's very much appreciated. Mr. Chairman and other members of the Committee, I appreciate the opportunity to speak with you today. For the record, I am Dr. Carolyn Mazure, with the academic affiliations as noted by Congresswoman DeLauro. I'm testifying today in my capacity as the chair of the Women's Health Research Coalition, which was created by the Society for Women's Health Research two and a half years ago. The Coalition has nearly 200 members committed to advancing women's health research. Most of these members really include national leaders in scientific and medical investigations and in academic institutions throughout the country, and also does include people from voluntary health organizations as well as pharmaceutical and biotech companies, again, to the larger issue of trying to make transfer of information possible across these different constituencies. To begin, let me first emphasize that we strongly support the goal of improving the health and the health care of all individuals through newly discovered research based information that can be incorporated into medical practice and also incorporated into personal practice. But there are at least three reasons for a special focus on women's health and on understanding what are referred to as sex-specific factors in health and disease. First, women historically have been under-represented as subjects of scientific research for a variety of reasons. And when women have been included, even to this day, sex-specific analyses of health data have not traditionally been conducted. A recent GAO report coming out in 2000 also confirmed that finding. Second, age adjusted indicators of both health status and also of service utilization continue to show that women have more acute medical problems and higher hospitalization rates, even when you exclude hospitalizations due to childbirth. Finally, there are large gaps in our scientific knowledge about disorders and conditions that either affect women solely or predominantly or differently. For all these reasons, we ask the Congress to play a pivotal role in advancing research on the health of women, research that we believe will make a difference in women's lives and in so doing, will benefit every person in the country. That's what brings me to why I am testifying here today. The Coalition is seeking the Subcommittee's support on four major priorities. First, we join with others who have appeared before this Committee to advocate for a $3.4 billion or 6.5 increase in the NIH budget for fiscal year 2002. However, importantly, as the NIH grows to meet the great need for medical research in many areas of health, we ask for your support in ensuring that there be at least comparable increase directed towards women's health research within that pot of money. There is too much work to be done, as detailed in the written statement that I'm providing, not to ensure such funding. Second, we ask that the various offices, advisors and coordinators throughout the Department of Health and Human Services, those individuals who enhance the Department's focus on women's health research, be funded at least to the Administration's recommended levels. In particular, we strongly support the $50 million request in the President's budget for the Office of Research on Women's Health, which is, as you know, based within the NIH, and the $27 million request for the Office of Women's Health in the Office of the Secretary. These are significant increases that need to be maintained, but I want to point out also that other women's health representatives in SAMHSA and CDC and FDA andelsewhere also need strong support to carry out their missions. Third, within the $50 million for the Office of Research on Women's Health, that is the office with NIH, we ask for your strong support in creating women's health research centers, as recommended in the Administration's proposed budget. We believe these should be well funded interdisciplinary, peer reviewed centers, which collectively cover a wide range of critical sex and gender based health research issues. Such centers would provide an effective mechanism for operationalizing a strategy in women's health that would pursue a research agenda that's been designed by the Office of Research on Women's Health. This strategy is used, that is the strategy of centers, is used in cancer research, it's used in asthma research. Surely we can do it in a field of research that will directly affect so many of our citizens. With this funding, the entire field of sex and gender based research can move into a new era. Finally, we ask for your support in maintaining and expanding the BIRCWH program, which is sponsored by the Office of Research on Women's Health, again as recommended in the President's budget. BIRCWH, which stands for Building Interdisciplinary Careers in Women's Health, is training the next generation of women's health researchers. It is strongly supported by the institutes within NIH and by the community. NIH plans to issue a request for applications to generate a new round of these centers, but the Office of Research on Women's Health must have the $50 million appropriation to create them. Just last month, the Institute of Medicine issued a landmark report called Exploring the Biological Contributions to Health Research: Does Sex Matter? The results were unequivocal with regard to the incredible scientific opportunity in studying sex differences with regard to health. This Subcommittee and the Department of Health and Human Services routinely does turn to the IOM for advice on major questions related to medical research and practice because the IOM provides objective, scientific analysis. The report makes it clear that sex is a critical variable in understanding biology at the cellular level, and remains so through early development, puberty, adulthood and old age. We hope that the Committee will support the priorities I've outlined above to begin the process of implementing the IOM's fundamental conclusion that sex matters. Mr. Chairman, Committee, the Women's Health Research Coalition stands ready to work with the Subcommittee to advance research on women's health and sex-specific factors in health and disease and thus build a better future for all Americans. Thank you for this opportunity to testify. [The justification follows:] [GRAPHIC(S) NOT AVAILABLE IN TIFF FORMAT] Mr. Regula. Thank you. Mr. Obey. Mr. Obey. No questions. Mr. Regula. Mr. Jackson. Mr. Jackson. No questions, Mr. Chairman. Mr. Regula. Mrs. DeLauro. Mrs. DeLauro. No questions. I think Dr. Mazure just laid out a mission for all of us, and the kind of first-rate work that is done that we have seen and see the results of, I think just continues to let us know that we need to focus in this area, because of what the results have been, and where we might go. Thank you for your great work. Mr. Regula. I'm curious, obviously, the life expectancy of women is substantially higher than men. Shouldn't the focus be perhaps on both men's and women's health issues? For some reason it's just been women's health out at NIH. It would seem to me that it ought to be a little broader. What would be your observation? Ms. Mazure. I think that's a very important point. The way in which we really see it is, I think several points are embedded in the answer. One is that historically, women have not been the subjects of research. So we have a bit of scientific catch-up to do. Secondarily, in the new science and the way in which we're approaching women's health, we're very interested in what's referred to as sex-specific differences. And by looking at differences between women and men in reference to all forms of illness and all forms of disease prevention, we really are discovering as much about men's health as women's health. So I think the broad field of women's health really advances health knowledge in all areas for everyone. I also do think that in reference to the issue that you raised where men tend to live on average a shorter length of life than women, living longer doesn't always necessarily mean living better. It often is associated with higher rates of chronic disease, cancer, dementias, cardiovascular illness. Nevertheless, I think we have to do better at communicating information about health to men so that men are in a position to take better care of their own health. Mr. Regula. Thank you. We appreciate your being here. ---------- Tuesday, May 22, 2001. SMALL SCHOOLS WITNESS TOM VANDER ARK, EXECUTIVE DIRECTOR OF EDUCATION, BILL AND MELINDA GATES FOUNDATION Mr. Regula. Our next witness today is Mr. Tom Vander Ark, who's the Executive Director of Education for the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation, to talk about small schools. We're pleased to welcome you, Mr. Vander Ark. Mr. Vander Ark. Thank you, Mr. Chairman, members of the Committee. It's a pleasure to be with you today. I'm Tom Vander Ark, I'm the Executive Director for Education for the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation in Seattle. There's been a great deal of attention paid to elementary schools in particular in education reform in the last decade, and very little paid to high schools, which is surprising, because American high schools work well for relatively few students. Unfortunately, that's most true for economically disadvantaged students and students of color. But today there are hundreds of schools that are bucking that trend. They're public schools, charter schools, private schools, urban, rural, they're suburban schools, but they all have one thing in common: they're small. After 40 years of consolidation, about two-thirds of American students now go to high schools larger than 1,000 students. As former Governor Jim Hunt said, we've made a terrible mistake in America. And we think it's time to reverse that mistake. There are decades of research, and especially a plethora of research in the last five years that small schools make a difference. It's interesting to note that there's very more conclusive research on small schools than there is on small class size. And yet small class size is a top of mind issue for teachers and parents. What we know from the research is that small schools improve attendance, achievement, motivation, graduation rates, it results in higher college attendance rates, school safety and school climate are improved, there's better parent and community involvement and better staff satisfaction. Mr. Regula. I'm sorry to interrupt you, would you define small school? You're talking about it as a term. If we had some definition it would be a little easier to relate to your testimony. Mr. Vander Ark. The research is inconclusive on that front. We generally say about 400 students, or less than 100 students per grade. So if it's a 6-12 school, it might be 600 students. But it's less than 100 students per grade. Mr. Regula. Would that be, would you define it as a small school in terms of a building, could it be one school district with a lot of small units? Mr. Vander Ark. Absolutely. I'll give you an example. The Julia Richman High School in the East Side of Manhattan, in the early 1990s, was one of three dozen large comprehensive high schools in New York City that had graduation rates of less than 25 percent. Let's think about that for a minute. This is a school that serves economically disadvantaged students, primarily students of color. They had a graduation rate of less than 25 percent. Today that center, it's now called the Julia Richman Education Complex, that complex now has four small focused high schools, a K-8 school, a school for autistic children and a day care center. So there's about 1,600 students on that campus. All four of those high schools have graduation rates between 90 and 95 percent and college attendance rates of the same. All of the students in that school share the amenities of a large school, gymnasiums, auditorium, performing arts center, and a library. All of these schools, and the hundreds of great small schools in New York, in Chicago, in the Bay Area, all operate on the same per pupil allocation as large schools. So the notion that they're less efficient is absolutely not true. For the same money, we can get the benefits that I described earlier. Why is this important to us? It's become a focus of our work because high schools are the largest, the least efficient and least effective and the most intractable schools in our system. We've developed a two-pronged approach of starting new small high schools and trying to help transform big bad schools into a multiplex of good small schools. But changing an American tradition is far from easy. The Gates Foundation and a number of other private philanthropies have contributed considerable resources to this daunting challenge. But it's going to take multi-sector collaboration to effect real change at scale. There's a growing consensus that our high schools aren't working, especially for most economically disadvantaged students. And there's fortunately a growing consensus about the attributes of schools that work for all students. We feel strongly that it's time to address this important injustice in our schools and to promote real design, so that all of our schools work for all of our kids. Thank you for the opportunity to testify. [The justification follows:] [GRAPHIC(S) NOT AVAILABLE IN TIFF FORMAT] Mr. Regula. Mr. Obey. Mr. Obey. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. Isn't it true that the research shows that student performance is superior in high schools that are smaller than 800 students as opposed to larger? Mr. Vander Ark. No question. Mr. Obey. I find it interesting and frustrating that last year this Committee worked to increase the appropriation to assist school districts to explore the opportunity to create smaller schools, especially at the high school level. We increased funding for that program from $45 million to $125 million. But, the bill which is on the floor today eliminates this specific authorization for small schools. I find that distressing because I think that small schools are absolutely critical at the high school level if we're going to improve not just academic behavior but social behavior as well. I congratulate the organization that you are running for its emphasis on the problem. Just one other point. It's my understanding, Mr. Chairman, that in Florida, Governor Bush and the legislature have passed legislation requiring that all new high schools that are built be of the smaller variety. I wish that nationally we would get the same message as we're getting from the kid brother in Florida. [Laughter.] I also would note that I've seen a number of comments which suggest that small high schools are more costly per student. My understanding is that while they may have a higher cost per student, that they are less costly per graduate, indicating that there is a higher level of performance that pays off economically as well as academically. Mr. Vander Ark. Mr. Chairman and Mr. Obey, our findings are that the hundreds of small schools that exist today generally operate on the same per pupil allocation. I would argue, as Ms. Keegan did earlier, that we do need to address the inequities in our funding system. This is true especially in our major cities. I would agree that we need funding that's needs based and that follows the students. That's a different but related issue to this one. I think the important point here is, there are hundreds of great schools doing a great job for the same per pupil allocation. Now, two related issues on capital costs. Some would argue that it costs more in terms of capital construction per pupil for a small school. That may be true if you want to adorn it with all the amenities that we traditionally think of on a secondary campus. But clearly, there's opportunity, as Julia Richman and many others illustrate, for a number of schools to share a campus facility with the traditional accoutrements of an American high school. The second issue is that there is a transaction cost, a transformation or a redesign cost to transform a big, comprehensive school into a multiplex of small schools. It's not capital cost, it is primarily time and resources for the staff to rethink the way their schools are designed, to be trained to teach in small teams, to serve as advisors for students. And that's what the bulk of our funds pay for, is that redesign effort. Mr. Obey. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. Mr. Regula. Mr. Obey, you and I both went to the Aspen seminar. As I recall, Dr. Levy from the New York City system was pointing their system in that direction. Is my recollection similar to yours? Mr. Obey. He certainly indicated that he wanted to, in the remarks that he gave to the conference. Mr. Vander Ark. I can address that, Mr. Chairman and Mr. Obey. The Gates Foundation, Carnegie and the Open Society Institute have helped to support a major initiative with New York City and New Visions for Public Schools in an effort to both start new small schools and to attempt to transform 12 to 15 of the worst large high schools in New York into small schools, small, a multiplex of small schools much as I've described. Mr. Regula. Do athletics get in the way? Mr. Vander Ark. Absolutely. This is dangerous and politically radioactive work, largely because high schools work today for elite athletes and for the top 10 percent of our students. Those are vocal and influential parents. So it is clearly an issue. I'll mention the Julia Richman story. The students from those four high schools play together on interscholastic teams. They compete, they mix teams and compete internally on intramural teams. So again, that's a great model of how you can have your elite sports, if that's what a community desires, but have very small focused coherent programs where every child gets the attention they deserve. Mr. Obey. Mr. Chairman, I guess I would observe that it would be interesting to compare headline size for a high school that wins a conference football championship versus a high school that produces an unusually large number of national merit scholars. Mr. Regula. I agree with you completely. I live on a farm. At the end of my driveway is an old red brick one room school that was closed about 50 years ago. I've said many times, I have three children, I would have been absolutely delighted had they gone there. Because they would have had eight grades eight times, provided there was a good teacher. That's always a caveat that goes all the way througheducation. We're into a consolidated school, and I see some real problems. I'm curious, how does your foundation practically, how do you try to encourage this trend, probably to discourage consolidations or big schools and at the same time encourage some deconsolidation, if you will? Mr. Vander Ark. Well, Mr. Chairman, I'll give you an example of the work that we just initiated in Colorado with Governor Owens' office. First of all, we're helping to create a statewide foundation to create a network of technology focused high schools in the most economically disadvantaged neighborhoods in Colorado. Secondly, we're working with the State accountability system, so that every high school that's labeled as under- performing in their State becomes eligible for the program that we've designed, that will actually supplement the State aid to failing schools. So they get a small amount of money from the State and then if they can demonstrate to us some sense of leadership and initiative, we'll supplement that with additional money, with outside consulting help and some clear direction on what they ought to do. Mr. Regula. You've obviously worked with the New York system and from what I remember of Dr. Levy's comments it's working pretty well in terms of, as compared to what it had been before. Mr. Obey. I'm sorry, I didn't hear you. Mr. Regula. I said, I think Dr. Levy indicated in his testimony to us in that seminar that their decentralization was working fairly effectively for students. Mr. Obey. He thought it was. He also mentioned that there were a considerable number of critics after him, as you indicated. But I think he'll outlast them. Mr. Regula. Chicago's done--I'm sorry Mr. Jackson isn't here--Chicago's done some pretty innovative things. I met with their superintendent, and at least I was under the impression that they were doing what you're suggesting. Is that accurate? Mr. Vander Ark. Mr. Chairman, that's accurate. Pat Walsley, who is now the dean at the University of Washington, recently authored a study called Small Schools Great Strides, which chronicles the success of the roughly 150 small schools in Chicago. So they've certainly recognized that size matters, and that good teaching most frequently happens in small schools, where teachers can work together, where they can hold each other accountable, and where they can hold students accountable. You can create an authoritative environment in a small school that's virtually impossible to create in a large school. Mr. Regula. Did you get an opportunity to testify in the authorizing committee? They were doing a bill that we have on the Floor now. Mr. Vander Ark. Mr. Chairman, as a foundation we don't advocate for particular appropriations or bills. So no, I didn't. Mr. Regula. Well, from what you're saying, Mr. Obey, the ability of this Committee to support a small school program would be inhibited by the lack of authorization in the new bill. Mr. Obey. Well, what I'm saying is that the authorization bill repeals the specific authorization. We have, in the past, on this Committee found ways, by using general authorizations, to accomplish purposes that are constructive, and I hope that we can find that in this instance as well. I think it's a strange argument that some people make--that no effort is required on the part of the Federal Government because the Gates Foundation is involved. That seems to say, let cousin Johnny do it, rather than me, when we all ought to be working on it together. Mr. Regula. Well, thank you for coming. I'm in total agreement with what you're saying. I've been seven years in public education and on the State school board. I think this trend of bigness is better is just being demonstrated as not the right way to go. Have you developed any paper on this subject, to support what you've presented this morning? Of course we have your testimony. Is there anything additional to that? Mr. Vander Ark. Mr. Chairman, we have several articles on this subject. My testimony includes references to a number of the research studies that have been published in the last four or five years. I'd also call your attention to the Dropout Commission that made their report on January, Commission on the Senior Year, which made their report in February, the American Youth Policy Forum, which published their report earlier this year, the Education Trust, all of those organizations have come out very strongly in favor of small schools, and all of those reports cite many of the same pieces of research that are noted in my testimony. Mr. Regula. What you're saying is that in the thoughtful establishment, this is the direction that the research is taking? Mr. Vander Ark. There's very strong momentum among people that are looking at data. Unfortunately, that conversation has not reached most local school districts. Mr. Regula. I think we'll need to be creative. Mr. Obey. Well, I think that's allowed in the democratic system. [Laughter.] Mr. Regula. Thank you very much for coming. I commend you for your work, and I hope you have ever greater success. Mr. Vander Ark. Thank you. Mr. Regula. Because I think it's absolutely the right way to go. ---------- Tuesday, May 22, 2001. NIH WITNESS ERIC S. LANDER, CHAIR, JOINT STEERING COMMITTEE FOR PUBLIC POLICY Mr. Regula. I understand, Dr. Lander, you're on a tight schedule. So we'll give you an opportunity to be heard at this moment. Mr. Lander. Thank you very much, Mr. Chairman. Mr. Regula. Your testimony will be in the record and we'll welcome a summary. Mr. Lander. Great. Mr. Chairman, members of the Subcommittee, thank you for inviting me here this morning to testify. My name is Eric Lander, I'm a professor of biology at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology and the Director of the Whitehead Institute/MIT Center for Genome Research. I'm here today representing the Joint Steering Committee for Public Policy, which is a coalition of scientific research societies that jointly represents about 25,000 research scientists nationwide and globally. My own scientific research is related to the Human Genome Project. Our own center at the Whitehead Institute was the largest of the contributors to the recent sequencing of the human genome, and in addition, we work on trying to apply this knowledge to dissect the basis of human diseases, the causes of cancer and diabetes and heart disease. The scientific community is tremendously grateful for the support of this Committee and of the Congress in increasing the funding for the National Institutes of Health over the past several years. The additional funding is having a major impact on the pace of biomedical research, and it's been responsible for much of the remarkable scientific progress that we read about on a daily basis. I'm here today to ask you to continue increasing that support toward the goal of doubling the NIH budget. Given your own history of support for biomedical research, I take it for granted that you consider funding the NIH to be a tremendously important investment in our children's future. And I take it for granted that you know that millions of Americans suffer from Alzheimer's disease and arthritis and cancer and chronic lung diseases and diabetes and heart disease. And I take it for granted that you know that such diseases pose an incalculable burden of pain and hardship on its victims and their families, as well as a financial burden estimated approaching $1 trillion annually. But this alone would not be enough to justify substantial increases now. Substantial increases now can only be justified if two things hold. First, that there really are extraordinary and urgent new opportunities that justify additional investment. And two, that there's confidence that additional investment can be used well. And you have every right to demand answer to those questions, and I want to provide them. Number one, what are these new opportunities and what's so urgent them anyway? Mr. Chairman, there is an extraordinary revolution now underway. The revolution is most apparent in such landmarks as the Human Genome Project, which has given us the parts list for human medicine, the inventory of 30,000 or 40,000 human genes. This is having a dramatic effect on medicine. It's the equivalent of being able, for the first time, to have a look under the hood of the car to see what's wrong. One of the most uncomfortable facts about medicine in the 20th century is that for most diseases, including heart disease, diabetes, hypertension, depression and schizophrenia, we have had no clue what the actual cause is, the molecular mechanism of the disease. So we've been shooting in the dark. We've mostly been treating symptoms. Sometimes we get it right, but often it's a matter of luck. In the past decade, we've begun to see real progress on discovering the mechanisms, the causes of disease. Let me give you an example of what happens when we know the mechanism. Ten days ago the FDA granted swift approval to a new cancer drug, Gleevec, directed against a kind of leukemia called Chronic Myelogenous Leukemia. It was a new kind of cancer drug: it is non-toxic and taken orally. Of 53 patients who had failed conventional therapy and were expected to die of their disease, 53 had remissions. Moreover, the drug is now turning out to be effective against other cancers for which it wasn't even designed, including a kind of stomach cancer. Some people call this a miracle, and in many ways, it is. But it's no accident. It resulted from a dogged effort to understand the cause, the mechanism of leukemia. First, the recognition that two chromosomes were consistently rearranged in this cancer. Then the discovery that a novel gene caused by this chromosome rearrangement produced an errant protein locked in the on position. Then the proof that this protein, this errant protein, was absolutely essential for the cancer cells to grow. All this was the product of NIH funded research, through the foresight of this Congress. Once the mechanism was known, talented chemists in the pharmaceutical industry stepped in and created a drug to block this errant protein, and without side effects. Mr. Chairman, it's the difference between trying to fix a car when you have no idea what's wrong and between trying to fix a car when you can look under the hood. And this is not an isolated story. Ten years ago we had no idea what the mechanism was of Alzheimer's disease. Since then, we've been able to look under the hood and find key causative mechanisms. And it's led to an explosion in drug development. I believe that we will see drugs emerge that can prevent Alzheimer's disease before symptoms occur, that is, prevention of diseases, rather than dealing with the devastating consequences. This could only happen by knowingthe mechanism. Similar stories have emerged for Parkinson's disease and other diseases. We're standing on the threshold of what I think is the greatest revolution in the history of medicine. We're now set to work out the mechanisms underlying most common diseases that afflict people. And it's an audacious program to imagine that this could happen, but I believe it will happen in the next one to two decades. But it's going to take major and increased investment now. I think the investments were justified. We finally have the tools to lay bare the secrets of disease, and I think we'd be failing the American people in general and our children in particular if we didn't seize the opportunity. If we delay investment today, we delay understanding, we delay therapies and cures. I think this is a very special moment in history and we need to seize it. Number two, how can this Congress be sure that the increased investment is being used widely? That is, how can you monitor the progress? Some years ago, this Congress passed the Government Performance and Results Act, GPRA. What performance and results should you be monitoring? Well, the development of new drugs and therapies that stemmed from NIH is one such measure. But it's a long term measure, because it can take a decade or more for understanding to translate to therapy. Instead, I would urge you to focus on the discovery of mechanisms. Keep a scorecard of how we're doing at discovering the mechanisms. That's the key, because you can feel confident that if we reveal the molecular mechanisms, it will unlock the prodigious energies of industry and academia to fashion therapies and cures. In this way, you can be sure that the investments are reaping dividends. You can also look at new initiatives at NIH, such as the newly established NIH Center for Minority Health, which is a sign that we're working together to ensure that biomedical research benefits all Americans. Number three, finally, Mr. Chairman, I know it's not the purview of this Committee, but I would like to add that for all of this to succeed, we need increased investment in other areas of science as well. Increased investment in biomedical research will not reap its full potential unless we have corresponding investment in physics, chemistry, computational science, etc. These allied disciplines are absolutely essential. For example, for figuring out what protein shapes and functions are about, or for developing non-invasive imaging to speed clinical trials through the study of early markers of disease. The President's budget for biomedical research is very encouraging. But I'm deeply concerned that the budget for other sciences is neglecting key investments. In summary, this is no ordinary time. The science of the last century has now brought us to an extraordinary threshold of understanding the basis of disease, and it is time for extraordinary investment to reap those benefits. Thank you for your consideration, and I'd be glad to answer your questions. [The justification follows:] [GRAPHIC(S) NOT AVAILABLE IN TIFF FORMAT] Mr. Regula. Thank you. Mr. Obey. Mr. Obey. Well, I want to thank you very much for your statement. It's not the first time that I've heard you, but I'm very happy that you focused on our obligations beyond NIH. I've said this before, but I'll say it again very frankly. There is a member of the Subcommittee that was prepared to vote for at least the President's budget on NIH. It's become the holy picture item in the health budget. We all pose for political holy pictures by stumbling toward the nearest microphone to say how much we're dedicated to NIH research. The problem is two-fold, as I see it. First of all, this big investment in NIH, according to the budget, will stop after 2004. Because then the budget estimates don't contain the 15 percent increases any more, the increases drop to low single digit levels, accurately reflecting what will be available in the budget as this tax cut that's being passed continues to drive everything else off the table. The other problem that we have, as you have indicated, is that if all we do is fund NIH and don't deal with NSF and some of the other seed corn agencies, we are going to cut the plant off at its roots. The flowers may look pretty for a few days, but they won't last that long, at least not in the health we'd like to see them. This isn't really a question. It's just a statement of philosophy. I think that we have a once in a generation opportunity, now that we have surpluses instead of deficits. We have a choice to make between tossing almost all of those surpluses at the private sector in the form of individualized realizations of happiness through tax cuts, or we can try to reserve a major part of those surpluses, I would hope by far the largest part, to finally enhance the quality of public services and the strength of public investments that must by nature be a collective enterprise rather than an individual enterprise. I think we're about to blow the biggest chance we've had in a generation to really make a difference, not just for medical research, but in a number of other areas as well. I thank you for focusing not just on NIH, but also on the other near orphans in the scientific community, given the squeeze that we have on those agencies. Mr. Lander. Thank you. We can't deliver on the promise without a full picture of the support it will take. Mr. Regula. Thank you for a thought provoking testimony. Mr. Lander. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. ---------- Tuesday, May 22, 2001. TEACHERS WITNESS C. EMILY FEISTRITZER, PRESIDENT, NATIONAL CENTER FOR EDUCATION INFORMATION Mr. Regula. Our next witness is Emily Feistritzer, President of the National Center for Education Information. Your testimony will be made part of the record, we welcome your comments. Ms. Feistritzer. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. I'm the President of the National Center for Education Information, which is a private, non-partisan research organization in Washington. I started the National Center for Education Information just to fill what I thought was a gap of a need for collecting, analyzing and reporting objective and unbiased information. So we really don't take a position on these matters, but we take great pride in the kind of data that we've been able to make available. I thought I was going to follow the gentleman from the Gates Foundation and I wanted so much to do that, because so many things he said fit right into this changing market for teaching and alternative routes for bringing people into teaching. But I wanted to share with you, before I get into my statement, in a book that we do called Alternative Teacher Certification: A State by State Analysis, which I will make available to the entire Committee, in the introduction we have a section on schools in the nature of how schools are organized in this country. One of the bulleted items states that at the high school level, only 3 percent of all secondary schools in this country enroll 1,500 or more students, and yet they account for 33 percent of all enrollment. It just reinforces what Mr. Vander Ark said. Forty-one percent of schools enroll fewer than 400 students, and yet account for only 18 percent of all students. So we're really talking about a relatively small number of schools throughout this country that enroll the proportion of all the students who are enrolled in schools. This is very much related to the whole issue of teacher supply and demand, which is the topic that I was asked to speak with you about. We've all heard that we're going to need to 2.2 million additional teachers in the next decade. You could have a whole hearing with probably 25 witnesses to just debate what that actually means. But the fact of the matter is, the demand for teachers is increasing, not decreasing. But it's actually not increasing everywhere. The demand for teachers is really isolated in certain regions of the country, namely large inner cities and in outlying rural areas of the country. And in certain subject matter areas, such as science, mathematics and special education. We find that actually, the Nation nationally is turning out enough people to teach. The colleges and universities that prepare teachers in this country are producing roughly 200,000 brand new, never taught before teachers each year, and that's more than enough actually. The problem is most of the people who are coming through colleges of education fully qualified to teach don't want to teach where the demand for teachers is greatest. Undergraduate teacher education programs historically have turned out young white females who do not want to teach in large inner cities and who do not want to move actually very far away from home. Now, what we find also is that in the National Center for Education Statistics data from baccalaureate and beyond studies, that about 60 percent of baccalaureate degree recipients who are fully qualified to teach are not teaching the following year, and only about 53 percent of them are not teaching five years out. So we have a production of teachers in this country that is great enough to meet the demand. The problem is that the production of teachers is not satisfying the demand, because the demand is, as I said earlier, isolated and quite specific to geographic regions and to specific subject areas. That's why this new movement toward States developing alternative routes for recruiting, training and licensing teachers makes so much sense. Because not only have alternative routes evolved since the mid-1980s and grown rapidly since the mid-1990s, it is because not only are they meeting the demand for additional teachers in specific areas of the country, they are also meeting the demand created by the supply of people who are stepping forward to want to teach who do not fit the traditional definition of a teacher, which is a high school student going to go college and majoring in education. We find that there are huge numbers of what I call non- traditional candidates for teaching, people who already have a bachelor's degree, usually in a field other than education, many of whom have life experience, some of whom have been in other careers and retired, who really do want to teach. And they really do want to teach in areas of the country where the demand for teachers is greatest. And alternate routes are being developed all over the country to specifically recruit these people to teach in these ares of the country where the demand is greatest. And the Federal Government, in its infinite wisdom, has been through the authorizing language and through this appropriation moving in the direction of providing some much needed support of the development of these types of programs. I see that my formal time is up, so I'll stop here. [The justification follows:] [GRAPHIC(S) NOT AVAILABLE IN TIFF FORMAT] Mr. Regula. I'm curious, is the multiplicity of requirements, and it varies from State to State for certification, is somewhat of a barrier to the people you characterize perhaps who have had other careers and would like to teach, but suddenly they're faced with going back and taking a couple of years of how-to courses, is that a problem? Ms. Feistritzer. I think it is a problem. You can't ask people who have finished their degrees, in some cases masters degrees and some cases professional and even more advanced degrees, to give up employment and go back to college and pay tuition to take courses required for certification and may or may not be able to find a job. So that is a problem. That's why the alternate routes that are designed specifically to attract this population of people and are developed to train that population of people to teach in the very schools that most traditionally trained teachers don't want to teach in make an awful lot of sense, and are being met with a tremendous amount of enthusiasm from mid- career changers and military personnel and so on. Mr. Regula. Mr. Obey. Mr. Obey. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. As you know, last year we were able to provide $34 million in the budget for non-traditional teacher recruitment activities. And $31 million of that was based on the Transition-to-Teaching Initiative. What's your evaluation of that program? Ms. Feistritzer. I have testified before the authorizing subcommittee, and I'm very much in favor of that. I think that the States really do need financial support in developing these programs. Most of the programs that are springing up around the country are really on the backs of the participants in the program. They can be very costly to the individual who's trying to get a credential to teach. So I think the transitions to teach program, in the current budget, is an excellent program. My only caution, I was around during the block grant era of Chapter II in the early 1980s. I saw a lot of really good programs, like teacher centers and teacher corps really get lost in the block grants. And I think that, I have a problem with turning all of this money over to the States to do with as they will. I would hope that there would be some guidelines that these monies be used for such things as the design and implementation of alternative certification routes, for example. Because I'm not sure the States will wind up using it for that if they can get away with using it for something else. Mr. Obey. How about the Teach for America model? Ms. Feistritzer. Teach for America is really a recruitment effort for recent college graduates to make a two year commitment to teaching. I like Teach for America a lot. I like Troops to Teachers an awful lot. But those two programs are specifically recruitment efforts for specific populations of people. The alternative teacher certification arena is much broader and much bigger and encompasses a whole lot more people and has more potential, I think, for bringing in wider audiences of people in a way that fits with the current bureaucracy of American education, which is not likely to change in our lifetimes. Mr. Obey. I would just have to say that in light of your other comments about block grants, that I'm fascinated. One thing that fascinates me is that there are a number of people in Congress and out who will criticize the degree of educational attainment of students in the country. And they will say, we just aren't doing very well at all. So their answer is to turn even more authority over to the people who already have the lion's share over running schools, namely the local school boards. I don't think my district is much different than anybody else's, local school boards make 95 percent of the decisions about how kids get educated and where they get educated, who they get educated by and where resources go. It's always fascinated me that the Federal Government, which really is only nibbling around the edges in terms of the financial support it gives education, somehow gets the blame for the lack of performance in schools that are largely governed by local school districts. I think you have to conclude that that judgment is not based on evidence, but it's based more on ideology or philosophy. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. Mr. Regula. Has there been any movement on the part of States to remodel their requirements for certification to make it easier for these transition type of individuals? Ms. Feistritzer. We survey the State departments of teacher ed and certification every year. And the results of that are published here. There's been a lot of movement in that direction. I am more encouraged, I've been covering and around education all my life, I'm a third generation educator. And I'm actually more optimistic than I think I've been throughout my life about the future of the teaching profession for this single reason, that the population of people who are stepping up to the plate sincerely wanting to teach is radically changing, positively. And the States and even the institutions of higher education are being, I think, very positively responsive to using it as an opportunity to design some really good, sensible, not a whole lot of courses and riff-raff, but really sensible, field based mentor companion teacher preparation program for life experienced adults. Forty-one States now say they are doing such a thing, but they need a lot of support. Mr. Regula. Has the NEA and/or the AFT been a help or hindrance, or are they neutral on this whole effort? Ms. Feistritzer. The NEA and the AFT both, to their credit, have been back in the early 1980s, rather silent on the issue and increasingly open to the development of good new alternative teacher preparation programs. They've not gone as far as sitting here before you, calling for $1.2 billion for them. But they have been increasingly, I think, open to the development of collaborative alternative teacher preparation. Mr. Regula. That's a positive note. Thank you for coming. Ms. Feistritzer. Thank you. Tuesday, May 22, 2001. STUDENT FINANCIAL AID WITNESS BRIAN FITZGERALD, STAFF DIRECTOR, ADVISORY COMMITTEE ON STUDENT FINANCIAL ASSISTANCE Mr. Regula. Brian Fitzgerald, Director, Advisory Committee on Student Financial Assistance. Your statement will be made part of the record, you may summarize, please. Mr. Fitzgerald. Thank you, Mr. Chairman, Mr. Obey, for the opportunity to present an overview of the Advisory Committee's most recent report entitled Access Denied: Restoring the Nation's Commitment to Equal Educational Opportunity, a copy of which is in your materials today. For the record, my name is Brian Fitzgerald, I'm staff director of the Advisory Committee. I will deliver testimony on behalf of Dr. Juliet Garcia, who is President of the University of Texas-Brownsville and Chairperson of the Advisory Committee. She is ill today and apologizes for not being able to be here herself. Our committee was authorized by Congress in the Higher Ed amendments of 1986, to provide expert, independent, objective advice to Congress and the Secretary on Federal student financial aid policy issues. The committee's most important legislative charge is to make recommendations that maintain access to post-secondary education for low income students. Over two years ago, the committee began a comprehensive examination of the condition of access, that is the opportunity to attain a baccalaureate degree. At three public meetings devoted exclusively to access, the committee was informed by testimony of dozens of students, college administrators and scholars about the financial as well as the academic, social and cultural dimensions of access. Emanating from those activities and a parallel two year study, the Access Denied report marshals the most authoritative data to pinpoint the access problem and its causes. The report documents the wide gap between available aid, including loans, and college costs for low income students. This gap, known as unmet need, is $3,200 a year at two year public colleges and $3,800 a year at four year public colleges. Significant enough to lower the rate at which low income students enter college, attend four year institutions and attain a bachelor's degree. More than 30 years ago, the Federal Government entered into a partnership with States and higher education institutions to ensure that all Americans could have access to a college education without regard to their economic means. As a result, tens of millions of Americans who otherwise would not have had access to college have attended and earned associate's and bachelor's degrees. This highly successful effort increased the rate at which Americans enter college to record levels, which has fueled this Nation's economic growth. Unfortunately, the post-secondary participation of low income students continues to lag far behind that of their middle and upper income peers. Large differences in college entry rates persist, with gaps as wide as three decades ago. In addition, a recent U.S. Department of Education study indicated that low income students who graduate high school at least marginally qualified, enroll in four year institutions at half the rate of their comparably qualified high income peers. Equally troubling, only 6 percent of low SES students earn a bachelor's degree, as compared to 40 percent of high SES students. These facts have major implications not only for the lifetime earnings of low income students, but it also robs the Nation of hundreds of billions of dollars a year in gross domestic product. Yet the challenges that face low income students today in gaining access to college will worsen considerably as a result of impending demographic forces. Rivaling the size of the baby boom generation, the projected national growth of college age population by 2015 exceeds 16 percent or about 5 million, with at least 1.6 million additional students enrolling in college, many of whom will be low income. Thus, even if college costs continue to grow no more rapidly than family income, these demographic changes will greatly increase the gross amount of financial aid required to ensure access. Unfortunately, financial barriers are higher now in constant dollars than they were three decades ago. The unmet need gap facing low income students has reached unprecedented levels, once again, $3,200 and $3,800 respectively at two year and four year public institutions. This includes all work and loan. Given these levels of unmet need, the failure to close the participation and completion gaps is not surprising. Unmet need is forcing low income students to choose levels of enrollment and financing alternatives not conducive to academic success, persistence and ultimately degree completion. One often hears the argument that poor academic preparation is the primary reason for low income students' lack of access. That is simply not true. Inadequate financial aid, that is the unmet need gap, often prevents the most highly qualified low income youth from attending college at all. In fact, the lowest achieving high income students attend college with the same frequency as the highest achieving poor students. If my committee members could leave you with only one message today, it would be this. The inability of tens of thousands of academically prepared low income students to enroll in a four year institution, attend full time and earn a bachelor's degree is the result of unmet need just as it was 30 years ago, and portends no narrowing of participation gaps, even in the long run. No matter how strong the Nation's commitment to academic preparation, no matter how quickly academic preparation advances, no progress can be made toward improving access without increases in need based grant assistance starting with the Pell Grant program. Thank you, Mr. Chairman and Mr. Obey. I would be happy to respond to any questions you have. [The justification follows:] [GRAPHIC(S) NOT AVAILABLE IN TIFF FORMAT] Mr. Regula. Thank you. I have just one. On the Pell Grants, which would you think would be more effective, have a larger amount the first year with a decreasing amount the second, third and fourth year, or have a flat amount for four years as part of a Pell Grant program? And some of the colleges have indicated they have to end up picking up the difference where it drops off in the second, third and fourth year. Do you have an opinion on this, which would be the better way to do it? Mr. Fitzgerald. Mr. Chairman, we looked not only at the ability of students to enter college, but the most important thing is that students must be enabled to persist and obtain a degree of their choosing. We feel that giving higher grants in the first year or first two years may have a slight impact on the number of students enrolling, that is to say, it may increase. We are very concerned that it may actually harm persistence, and put colleges in a position, and many of them serving the lowest income students will not be able to do this, but put colleges in a position where they have to make up the difference. Mr. Regula. So you'd prefer a flat amount for four years? Mr. Fitzgerald. That is correct, Mr. Chairman. Mr. Regula. Mr. Obey. Mr. Obey. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. I would simply note that, the reason why low-income students don't attend college in the numbers that we would like them to is very easy to understand, when you recognize that in 1975 the Pell Grant maximum award, as a percentage of the cost of going to college, was 84 percent, and today it's 39 percent. I don't think it takes a rocket scientist in order to figure out that that's a major reason why much smaller numbers of low- income people attend college than would be the case if we really, truly had equal access to education. This country is great at myths. We always talk about equal justice under the law, and liberty and justice for all in the pledge of allegiance. But when you take a look at performance, if our words were to match what we're actually doing, the pledge of allegiance would be amended so we say that we're providing liberty and justice for almost everybody, but not for all. That's all, Mr. Chairman. Mr. Regula. There have been some allegations that college tuition tracks with whatever we do with Pell Grants. Any validity to that? When you look at the numbers, it would appear that might be the case. Mr. Fitzgerald. Mr. Chairman, although our report does not specifically deal with college costs, I think there's been a good deal of emphasis on college costs recently. We've examined that very carefully. We find no relationship whatsoever to the level of Pell Grants and college costs. Congress created a commission on college costs to look at that. The fact of the matter is, the number of Pell Grant recipients is a relatively small number, it's a minority among students enrolled in college. So if Pell were driving college costs, you would be, for example, I believe you are on the board of trustees at Mount Union---- Mr. Regula. Right. Mr. Fitzgerald. I was just look at the data, I don't know what the enrolment is, I'm sort of backing into it. But there are three times as many loans as grants, as Pell Grants, at the college. If Pell were driving tuition at your college, you would be in effect taxing non-Pell Grant recipients when they are no better off as a result of rising Pell Grants. In fact, the majority of students attend public institutions, about 80 percent of all students. Those tuitions are set by a public governance process unrelated to levels of Federal and often unfortunately, State aid. And in key States, California, Massachusetts, Virginia, tuitions have declined, 20 percent in Virginia in 1999-2000. So frankly, I think the concern about college costs is actually, the jawboning, if you will, has led college leaders to look very carefully at that and frankly make a very concerted effort to even lower tuition. That is going to change, though, with the decline in State subsidies. Mr. Regula. Yes, we're having that in Ohio because of the budget constraints. Mr. Kennedy. Mr. Kennedy. All the talk about Pell makes me very proud to come from Rhode Island. And of course, Pell didn't pioneer the Pell Grant without understanding the importance of what it meant to my State and all the institutions of higher learning in my State. I know from hearing from them, having gone to a number of graduations this past weekend and talked to the boards of directors at the different public institutions, they're all very concerned about what's coming down the road in terms of funding for higher education and assistance from the Federal Government. So I welcome your concerns and advocacy on behalf of financial aid to students. We certainly need it now more than ever, because as we all know, higher education is the key to opportunities for the future. So thank you. Mr. Regula. Mr. Obey. Mr. Obey. Mr. Fitzgerald, I'd just like you to repeat one sentence that you uttered earlier. You said the lowest achieving high-income students attend college at the same rate as the highest achieving low-income students? Mr. Fitzgerald. That's correct, Mr. Obey. It's 78 percent of the highest achieving low-income students go to college, and 77 percent of the lowest-achieving high income students. The inescapable conclusion is that money matters. Mr. Obey. You bet. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. Mr. Regula. You made your point very effectively. ---------- Tuesday, May 22, 2001. EDUCATION WITNESSES PETER HORTON, ACTOR, THE CREATIVE COALITION AND COMMITTEE FOR EDUCATION FUNDING CAROLYN HENRICH, PRESIDENT, COMMITTEE FOR EDUCATION FUNDING Mr. Regula. Mr. Peter Horton, from the Creative Coalition and Committee for Education Funding. You're accompanied by Carolyn Henrich, President of the Committee for Education Funding. We're happy to welcome you, your testimony will be made part of the record, and we'll welcome your comments. Mr. Horton. Thank you very much. Good morning, Mr. Chairman and Congressman Obey, members of the panel. On behalf of the Creative Commission and the Committee for Education Funding, I would like to thank you for letting us speak on such an important topic. I think all of us in this room would agree that education of our children is a foundation stone, if not the cornerstone, for building and maintaining a healthy and prosperous society. My name is Peter Horton, as you stated. I am an actor, director, writer in the film and television business, as you also stated. This is Carolyn Henrich, President of the Committee for Education Funding. Mr. Chairman, I think I'm going to take your advice and not read my full written statement into the record. I can feel the room slowly wilting as we go along here, and with the exception of a couple of points, facts, I would like to share, I will then take another tack. One of the facts in my written statement is that the Federal investment in education has actually declined as a share of the Federal budget from 2.5 percent in 1980 to 2.1 percent today, which means that we are spending only two cents of every Federal dollar on education. Now, the groups that I am representing today are advocating a five cent expenditure, which certainly to me seems reasonable, at least. There's just a couple other quick facts. At the elementary and secondary level, enrollments are projected to set new records every year, reaching over 54 million by the year 2006. Over the next decade, college enrollments are expected to continue to grow another 11 percent, with one in five students coming from families below the poverty line. And then the last one, which truly shocked me, which is that 30 percent of our students live in poverty in this country, in this Nation. Mr. Regula. Thirty percent in the public schools live in poverty, is that correct? Mr. Horton. Yes, sir. It's shocking. Mr. Regula. It is. Mr. Horton. I think what I would like to do for the balance of my time, if you don't mind, is really speak to you from my heart. If I can, I would like to try and explain to you why I'm so passionate about this issue, why I think it's so important that you provide adequate funding for education in this country. I went to public school my whole adolescence and childhood. My sister Ann is a school teacher. One of my heroes growing up was a woman named Jo Egger Lundquist, who is an extraordinary educator up in the northwest, who believes that teaching is not a profession but a calling, which I believe and concur with completely. But most importantly, what's affected me the most on this issue is I recently became a father for the first time. As you know, becoming a father for the first time changes your whole outlook on things, your whole perspective on the world. I am facing a situation in Los Angeles where, for me to get adequate education for my daughter, I have to be willing and able to spend $15,000 a year for her grammar school education, and $10,000 for kindergarten. Now, there's a significant portion of this country that makes $10,000 to $15,000 a year in salary, and an even larger group that's making more than that but still can't afford that kind of expenditure for education. I don't know what we tell them. I don't know how we explain that to their children. My family and I spend a lot of time in a small community in California called Cambria. It has 5,000 students and the public school there is so overcrowded that a lot of the classroom work has to be done in the halls of that school. Now, recently a number of, or two education bond measures were up for a vote in that community, and both failed. Now, this is a community where neighbors know each other, they know the children that they're voting against. I don't know how to explain to those children why they still have to use the hallway as their classroom. Now, you are the only body in this country that has the ability to set a national standard of education for this country, a bar if you will, under which no student, not my daughter, not any student, will fall. We're spending two cents on a dollar. It used to be two and a half cents, it's now two cents. We need at least five cents. And that's not just my opinion. As I'm sure you know, polls indicate a vast majority of Americans feel like spending five cents on education is something they can support wholeheartedly, in fact are asking you to do something about that. I mean, we are the wealthiest country in this planet. And we're going through one of the most prosperous times in our history. We can afford five cents. We can afford the nickel. Thank you for your time. [The justification follows:] [GRAPHIC(S) NOT AVAILABLE IN TIFF FORMAT] Mr. Regula. Mr. Obey. Mr. Obey. Thank you for your testimony. I think you're right. I would put it another way, I don't think we can afford not to provide that nickel. I would just note two things. My wife started out at the time she married me, as a speech therapist. She used to work with kids in a hall closet, because that's all that the school system provided, in one of the schools that she taught. I never dreamed that 30 years later, you'd still have the same conditions. I was silly enough to believe in the improvability of a society on a consistent basis and in so many ways I've been proven wrong. The other point I would simply make is that you indicated that we've actually seen investments in education going down as a percentage of our national budget. I would point out that we've seen our investments in everything go down as a percentage of our national income. If you take a look at all of the dollars that the Appropriations Committee can provide in the budget this year, and if you compare that to what we were spending in 1980, this country was spending 5.2 percent of our total national income in 1980 on all domestic initiatives of the Federal Government except for entitlements. That's not counting programs like Social Security. Today we are at 3.4 percent of our total national income. And within five years, under the budget that Congress has just adopted, we will be down to 2.8 percent of our total national income. We are shortchanging education. We are shortchanging science. We are shortchanging health care. We're shortchanging environmental cleanup. We're shortchanging all of those collective enterprises that represent the fundamental responsibilities of people to each other in this society. And that's what makes this budget this year so incredibly frustrating. Mr. Horton. I would say also, I think the way we treat our children as a Nation is sort of the canary in the cave. It's our best indicator of our integrity as a Nation. I would say, our best focus right now, our most necessary focus right now is to make that statement as a Nation, that our children are worth at least five cents on the dollar, and the rest up to you. Mr. Obey. Well, again, all I will say is that over the last five years we've had an average annual increase in federal education appropriations of about 13 percent. Mr. Horton. Yes. Mr. Obey. This year, the President's budget cuts that rate of increase in half when you compare apples to apples, program delivery versus program delivery by academic year. Some progress. Thank you. Mr. Regula. Mr. Kennedy. Mr. Kennedy. Thank you. It seems to me that the big challenge we have as a Nation is to get these facts that you've just mentioned out and in the public consciousness. But not only that, there has to be a will, because we know more today than we ever have in our history about brain development and the impact of violence on children long term in terms of their learning. We know all these things, and yet we are treating our kids worse than they've ever been treated in the history of the Nation. So even during times of the Depression, kids were, according to historians and child development specialists, were essentially treated better because of the nature of family and attentiveness to children than they are today. It says something about the fact that it isn't just simply knowing more. We as a society believe that if we just had more information that would do it. It's not enough. It's a culture of change that has to take place for us to embrace this increase. So all I can say is that it takes a fundamental political change of heart. I think those that have advocated a reduction in Government spending insofar as the collective enterprises that Mr. Obey was talking about have been doing so by denigrating government and tearing down our public institutions and saying that you can't be trusted, politicians can't be trusted, our whole democracy is failing you, the public. And if you say that enough, people will believe it. And what they have come to believe is that that's true. Unfortunately, when they believe that that's true, there isn't the confidence to support these programs, and the public will to support these programs. So we need to change the ethic in this country that looks upon government and political leaders as the lowest form of life, and start changing the civic ethic in this country in terms of public institutions. So I can just say, I wholeheartedly appreciate what you're saying, and I do agree that we're becoming two separate societies as a result. What comes to mind is John Kenneth Galbraith's book, Private Wealth, Public Squalor. We're going to have a lot of people that have the wealth, and then we're not going to have any infrastructure in this country that everyone can share. It's not going to be a pretty sight, we're going to become a banana republic of sorts, an oligarchy, which is essentially what we're becoming now. So I think the disparity in income and wealth has never been greater in our country's history. It's an absolute travesty that we don't have public policy that reflects a newer view of where investments need to be made in education, because that is clearly the correlation between a good education and a person's ability to get a good job. It'sjust so direct. So how we can not look at that as a civil right, and if you deny that person a good public education, essentially they should be able to sue under the Fourteenth Amendment for denial of their civil rights. So I'm in agreement with you and I hope that you're successful in helping us change the public culture in terms of this. And certainly I acknowledge the fact that Hollywood has a great deal of influence in shaping our culture to the degree that folks like yourself can take a leadership role. I think that's really constructive and I appreciate it, and I really applaud your efforts. Mr. Horton. Thank you. I think one last brief thing. From the beginning of civilization, there's been a balancing act between the need of the community, the good of the community, the good of the individual. A healthy society has a very even balance. I think you here in Washington set that tone. Mr. Regula. I appreciate your testimony. I have to say, I read a disturbing article over the weekend from the Los Angeles Times. The headline is, after spending $2 billion, Kansas City schools get worse. A judge in Kansas City, Missouri ordered the schools to spend a lot more money. And he ordered the State government to come up with the money. They did spend the $2 billion, on top of everything else. And their scores are down now. Admittedly they didn't do well. It says, 900 top of the line computers, an Olympic size swimming pool, with six diving boards, I don't know exactly how that makes you a better scholar, padded wrestling room, etc., etc. I think we have to be careful, and I support more funding, but I think we also need to say what works. Because it's obvious that in Kansas City, $2 billion did not improve. In fact, they're going to take the system away, apparently, and turn it over to the State and/or the mayor. It says the new approach, back to the basics. I would hope this Committee has time after we've finished our regular hearings to have some oversight on what really works. How do we make sure the money we do spent causes an improvement in the system and the education of young people? I think that's part of the challenge. Mr. Horton. I agree with that. I clearly agree with that. I think, though, if you go back to Jo Egger Lundquist's statement that teaching is a calling, I think it's important. Mr. Regula. That's true. Mr. Horton. And I think we have to start treating teachers with that respect. I think yes, in any endeavor, there is going to be anecdotal evidence that says, this didn't work over here. And maybe that anecdotal evidence is a good reason to take a look at the system, try and make sure that we're functioning well in that system. Mr. Regula. Leadership, it says in Kansas City they've had 20 superintendents in 30 years. That tells you a lot right there. Mr. Horton. There you go. There's the problem. But I don't think that means we should not fund it. Mr. Regula. Oh, no. No, I'm more interested in how we can make sure our funding gets results, and that's exactly what you're saying, that's what all of us here want. Just as an aside, you have many credits as an actor. I see you were in the Into Thin Air, Death on Everest. Mr. Horton. I was. Mr. Regula. Did they film that there or here? Mr. Horton. I wish we could say we braved the elements and went all the way to Tibet, but we did it in Austria, which is sort of like Tibet but not really. [Laughter.] Mr. Horton. I think the food in Tibet would probably be better, actually, than it was in Austria. Mr. Regula. Very interesting. This was a TV series? Mr. Horton. A TV film, yes. Mr. Regula. That was a takeoff on the book? Mr. Horton. Yes. Mr. Regula. I read the book. Mr. Horton. The book was terrific. Better than the TV show, I have to admit. [Laughter.] Mr. Regula. Thank you for coming and for your interest. Tuesday, May 22, 2001. DEPARTMENT OF LABOR BUDGET WITNESS RICHARD TRUMKA, SECRETARY-TREASURER, AFL-CIO Mr. Regula. Our next witness will be Mr. Richard Trumka, the Secretary-Treasurer of the AFL-CIO, on labor issues. Thank you for coming. We'll put your testimony in the record, and you can summarize for us. Mr. Trumka. Thank you very much, Mr. Chairman. I'll do just that. Mr. Chairman, Congressman Obey, Congressman Kennedy, on behalf of the 13 and a half million working women of the AFL- CIO, I appreciate the opportunity to address some of the concerns the President's fiscal year 2002 budget raises for working families. Of particular interest and importance are proposals for key worker protection, work development and international labor programs. Those are the three that I'll focus on. Many of these programs, in our opinion, are already inadequate to fully protect the rights of working people here at home. Program cuts and flat funding will dilute these protections even further, with the impact harshest for the very workers who need most of the protections. If current economic weakening persists or worsens, these effects will be magnified. For workers in the global economy, program cuts undermine our capacity to promote workers' rights and fight child labor and other abuses, efforts central to ensuring that trade improves the living standards for all, rather than undermines the protections for America's working families. We ask you to bear all these concerns in mind as you consider the President's proposal for 2002. And I'll briefly talk about three of those areas. Worker protection. For 2002, the President proposes flat funding for the Employment Services Administration, which enforces the Nation's wage and hour laws, and for OSHA. These translate out into a $6 million cut in ESA and an $11.5 million cut in OSHA. We think this is the wrong approach. Violations of basic wage and hour requirements remain pervasive, especially in low wage industries. In the poultry industry, for example, a DOL survey in 2000 found wage and hour violations in virtually every surveyed establishment. Similar problems exist in garment manufacturing, where one DOL survey found violations in two-thirds of establishments in Los Angeles, agriculture and industrial laundries and many other traditional low wage industries. They even exist among workers in the modern economy, such as Silicon Valley immigrant workers who assemble circuit boards at home on a piece rate basis. The President's ESA funding proposals threaten the Department of Labor's oversight of working conditions and enforcement of work protections for all of these workers. Proposed funding levels for OSHA also threaten that agency's capacity to ensure workplace safety and health by cutting 94 full time staff positions, two-thirds of which come from enforcement, and by reducing funding for standard setting and worker safety training. In sum, the funding proposals for key worker protection programs concern us greatly. At a time when a Nation can afford to do so much, we should be investing more, not less, in protecting workers' rights. In job training, Mr. Chairman, the fiscal year 2002 budget would cut over $500 million in training and employment services, including reductions in adult, youth and dislocated worker programs, the latter having been targeted for a 13 percent reduction. Ironically, the President proposes to boost funding for the unemployment insurance system to handle an expected increase in claimants at the same time that he wants to cut back on retraining and reemployment programs that would help the unemployed return to work. We're also deeply troubled by the proposal to eliminate national funding for incumbent worker training. It's unrealistic to expect State and local programs to pick this up, this funding slack up, unless the needs of other workers, including the unemployed and the disadvantaged, are to be sacrificed. On the international labor program side, the President's proposals for DOL international labor programs in 2002 is $71.6 million. That's less than half of the 2001 budget of $148 million. It's especially ironic that the President is calling for such steep cuts at the same time that he is trumpeting those programs as the preferable alternative to trade agreement provisos as the mechanism for ensuring international labor rights. The cuts proposed by the President would seriously, seriously reduce the Nation's capacity to combat child labor around the world, to provide child laborers with basic educational opportunities, to support workplace HIV and AIDS programs targeted at youth, to promote the ILO declarations of the fundamental principles and rights of work and promote workers' rights around the world. Mr. Chairman, we believe these cuts are misguided and will undermine the efforts of American workers to compete in the global economy. We ask this Subcommittee and the full Committee to keep the needs of working families in mind during your budget deliberations and to fund adequately the important worker protection, job training and international labor programs on which many families in this country so deeply depend. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. [The justification follows:] [GRAPHIC(S) NOT AVAILABLE IN TIFF FORMAT] Mr. Regula. Thank you. Your testimony is timely, we have the Secretary of Labor this afternoon before this Committee. Mr. Obey. Mr. Obey. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. Mr. Trumka, I would simply make one observation and ask one question. In this tax bill that's working its way through the Congress, the cost of providing tax cuts over the next 10 years to persons making more than $200,000 a year--the cost of refusing to limit the size of their tax cuts to about $7,500 just from the rate cut alone--is about $280 billion over 10 years. We're going to toss that kind of money at them. Yet, we're being told that we have to cut the Dislocated Workers' Program appropriation by 13 percent and international labor programs by 50 percent. Would you explain what these international labor programs do? Would you explain how they work and would you explain why they're needed? I find it interesting that an Administration that is about to ask Congress for additional authority in the trade area is making a 50 percent cut in the program that is meant to cushion the blow of globalization on American workers because of their increasing vulnerability to products that are produced with either slave labor or child labor. Would you explain why these programs are not trinkets and why they are crucial to the average working person? Mr. Trumka. In short, the answer to that question is, these programs allow us to identify the most outrageous actions that take place around the world, whether it's child labor, whether it's forced labor, and allow us to correct them in one form or another. To not correct them causes American employees and American employers to compete with products in the global market that are made and subsidized and actually reward this type of child, prison, convict labor or forced labor. The other things allow us to monitor work places, for instance, to find out abroad who is complying with their labor laws and who isn't. We have tried for a significant amount of time to get workers' rights as part of every trade agreement, because it's our belief that workers' rights should be elevated to the same level as intellectual property rights. We've been unsuccessful to date. Each and every time we're told that we should look to another forum. And the forum that is always pointed to is the UNDILO. This cut actually slashes in half the program and takes any resemblance of seriousness that that claim can make away. No one, if this budget is passed with this type of funding, no one can seriously say to an American worker, you should go elsewhere to protect your rights, you should go elsewhere to look for help for a Mexican worker or Chilean worker or Brazilian worker, you should go elsewhere. Because this flies in the face of that argument. Then when you look at things like AIDS and HIV, all of those affect us on a moral basis and on an economic basis. The spread of AIDS-HIV has been a horrible thing that all of us want to eliminate. And we tried that, particularly with you, and particularly in some of the African nations, it's a very serious problem. But it's growing elsewhere. This would hamper our ability to do that. The other thing this would do is, we were successful in getting a few people, 17 I believe, around the world to work in embassies to identify outrageous workers rights and to promote workers rights in those areas, so that they could increase their standard of living, so that laws were either enforced, or if they were inadequate, we as a person in the global economy could say they were inadequate, change the laws so those workers have a real chance to participate in the global economy. All of those programs directly impact people here, whether it's in the Trade Bill directly with TAA assistance, whether it's competing with child labor, whether it's competing with people at forced labor, whether it's competing with Colombians who have workers truly assassinated. In one of the coal mines of Colombia, the president and vice president of the local union were being bussed from the home to the work site. The bus was stopped, they were taken off the bus and both of them were assassinated, shot directly in the head as a message to everybody else that if workers stand up for their rights, this is the fate that befalls you. We're forced to compete against a society that uses that threat to lower their prices and to avoid any resemblance of honest, fair treatment and dignity in workers. Mr. Obey. I think that's an eloquent statement. I think it will be a cold day in hell before the average worker in this country will be willing to support further trade agreements, so long as he sees programs like this that are meant to provide them barely minimal protection being shredded by their own government. Mr. Trumka. We would very much like to be able to support those trade agreements. But we would like for those trade agreements to be fair to workers on both sides of the border. And when we're told to go to the ILO, and then first of all, we don't adopt here at home any of the ILO standards that protect workers and then the meager funding that there is is slashed in half, I think it speaks forcefully to the American worker about, is that truly an avenue, or is that just a convenient way to deflect us. This truly highlights and makes it irrefutable that that avenue is a means to deflect us, not to protect our rights. Mr. Obey. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. Mr. Regula. Thank you. Thank you for coming. Just off the record, you were in mining, did you work in the mines? Mr. Trumka. Yes, I did, seven and a half years. Mr. Regula. Open pit or what type? Mr. Trumka. Deep mines in southwestern Pennsylvania. And Mr. Chairman, it's been my experience, when there's a downturn in the economy that the first place that employers, particularly mining employers, attempt to cut is in the health and safety area. Mr. Regula. Yes. Mr. Trumka. If you look at the last time, we had a downturn in both of our States. Mr. Regula. Right. Mr. Trumka. You saw that the downturn was preceded by a rash of belt line fires, people being killed, people being crippled and lost production facilities. At a time when our country needs as much energy as we can get, I think that's the wrong thing for us to be advocating. Mr. Regula. I was curious, my dad was a farmer, but he was also involved in a drift mine. I used to go back in there, and the closest I ever got to a pony was that animal that pulled the cars out to dumping tipple. So that's kind of a dangerous business, when you get right down to it, the point that you make. And I see, in China they've trapped a large group of miners. There's always that threat. Mr. Trumka. It's horrible what's happening, the lack of mine safety in China, the lack of safety in the workplace in China. Mr. Regula. Do you get any opportunity to communicate to countries like the Chinese, some decent standards and ideas on safety? Mr. Trumka. It's difficult, because as you well know, the representatives that they send to all the international events that are supposed to be worker representatives are really not worker representatives. So we talk to them about health and safety. We have American companies that attempted to go over there one time and create mining, but they've never caught on to the notion that the value of a human life was more important than a pound of coal. Mr. Regula. Well, thank you very much for your testimony. ---------- Tuesday, May 22, 2001. COMMUNITY HEALTH CENTERS WITNESS PATRICIA DIETCH, PRESIDENT AND CEO, DELAWARE VALLEY COMMUNITY HEALTH, INC. Mr. Regula. Patricia Dietch, President and CEO, Delaware Valley Community Health. Thank you for coming. Your statement will be put in the record, we'll appreciate your observations. Ms. Dietch. Thank you, Mr. Chairman, Mr. Obey. I'm Patty Dietch, I'm as you said, President and CEO of Delaware Valley Community Health in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania. I'm happy to be here today to represent the National Association of Community Health Centers and the millions of patients who get their medical care in health centers across the country. I want to start by thanking Congress and this Committee for your past support and let you know how much it's appreciated, that the past increases that have been awarded to community health centers have not gone unnoticed by those of us who try to keep them going and those of us who work in them and by our community boards and the patients who get their care there. I'd like to take a moment to tell you about how some of those past increases are used, from our experience. In 1999, Congress awarded a $94 million increase for community health centers. My organization applied for and received an expansion grant. And we moved into a suburban, actually an affluent suburban county, a suburban county of Philadelphia that has, their county seat is an old industrial town that has a lot of poverty pockets, economically depressed, because most of the industry had left the town. We identified a group of mostly minority low income patients who had very poor health status indicators and little or no access to health care. So we received this grant, and we projected that we would approximately serve about 1,600 patients. In the first year alone, we had 2,200 patients, over 7,000 medical visits. These are people who are working poor, who work in service jobs, in restaurants and landscaping, temporary construction jobs, 7-11, people who work but work in low paying jobs where they don't have employer sponsored health care plans. As a matter of fact, 83 percent of the people who come to the center do not have health insurance. These people, because they haven't received medical care in a long time, some of them 10 years, are very expensive to work up and treat. They require a lot of diagnostic tests, they have multiple problems that when you first get them, it takes a lot to get them managed, people who would have probably waited until they got catastrophic illnesses and went to the emergency room. So this center, by everyone's measure, has been a success. I think that you'll see opportunities for that all over the country. So far this year, there's 100 applications that have been received to expand health center sites, and almost 500 that have been submitted to add services to existing sites. Even the $150 million increase that we received last year, only half of these applications could be funded with that increase. And this year, we're starting in a new position for us, the President has made health centers a priority, and both President Bush and Health and Human Services Secretary Thompson have been very supportive of community health centers. The President has pledged to double the number of patients served by health centers over the next five years. And also, he has called to increase the number of new sites by 1,200 in 2006. Last year, health centers served over 11 million. Forty-two percent of them have no health insurance. Although already, health centers are the most efficient and effective providers in the country, serving each patient for just over $1 a day. When I learned that statistic, I did my own health center and we're actually below that. So I was pretty proud of that. In order to double the number of patients served over the next five years, NACHC has calculated that next year, health centers would have to serve an additional 1.65 million patients. If you add that up, that's a cost of $175 million increase. I understand that this is an ambitious goal that the President has set, and we're ready to meet it, how and ever we can. We continue to see an increasing number of uninsuredpatients in our health centers. In my organization in the last five years, the percentage of uninsured has grown from 11 percent to 43 percent, just since 1996. And now with the spotlight placed on the program by the President, I expect we will see more uninsured patients finding health centers and increasing our patient loads. Mr. Chairman and Mr. Obey, I work at health centers because I'm really committed to serving those less fortunate and to ensure that all people have access to high quality primary health care, and they really receive it at health centers. I think it's unparalleled, the kind of care that they get. We're extremely pleased with the President's call to double the number of patients seen in health centers in the next five years, but it's going to be difficult to achieve if the funding, the dollars say that even this year we're going to need $175 million just to start to get there over the five years. So that's what we're here to say, is that we appreciate your support and it's been greatly appreciated by the millions of people and those of us who keep these centers open every day. Thank you. [The justification follows:] [GRAPHIC(S) NOT AVAILABLE IN TIFF FORMAT] Mr. Regula. I think they are great programs. Mr. Obey. Mr. Obey. You say that the President has made funding of community health centers a high priority. I'd like to examine that statement a little bit. Last year, as you know, we provided an $150 million increase. Even with that, only half the applications were funded. Now the Administration is proposing an increase, not of $150 million as we had last year, but $124 million. I told the story in this Committee a week ago about a woman I met about two months ago who was not fortunate enough to live in an area where they had centers. I went to announce the creation of a dental clinic in this four-county low-income area. I met a young woman who was on Medicaid. Only about half the dentists in those four counties would even take Medicaid patients. And those who did take Medicaid patients would take no new ones. She had a child who needed to have the braces removed from his teeth. She looked for a long period to try to find a single dentist who would take those braces off. After calling 30 of them, she could find not a one. So she held the kid down while the father took the braces off with a pair of pliers. How many more health centers could be provided, and how many more people could be provided service, if the President's budget this year provided the same dollar increase that we had in the budget last year, namely $150 million rather than $124 million that's in the President's budget? Ms. Dietch. Well, I'm not sure I can do this math in my head, but $175 million would be 1.6 million additional patients. So a little over a million more patients for $150 million, 1.2. Mr. Obey. We have 40 million Americans without health insurance. At that rate, it will take about 40 years before we can get them covered by health centers, right? Ms. Dietch. That's true. Mr. Obey. Probably every member of this Committee and this Subcommittee will be pushing up daisies at that point, Mr. Chairman. Mr. Regula. Yes, probably. Mr. Obey. Thank you. Mr. Regula. Thank you for coming. I'm curious, is your pin of significance to community health centers? I sort of thought it might be, given the configuration? Ms. Dietch. No, I'd like to tell you that it is, but it was really just a gift from someone where I left a former job, and she bought it in a department store. It didn't come from Colombia, I probably should make up a better story. But it's really true. Mr. Regula. It indicates people helping people, and our reliance on each other. Ms. Dietch. Yes, and they're multicultural. Mr. Regula. That's very much what a community health center is. Ms. Dietch. Absolutely. Mr. Regula. A lot of volunteers, people helping people. Ms. Dietch. Actually, and a lot of usages of other Federal programs. My organization participates with the Senior Reemployment, the Older Americans Act, we have seniors who are trying to re-enter the work force come to us as volunteers, we've hired a couple of them, AmeriCorps, I mean, we utilize a lot of people. Mr. Regula. I think it's a great program. I hope we can do more. Ms. Dietch. Thank you. ---------- Tuesday, May 22, 2001. PUBLIC HEALTH WITNESS ANTHONY ROBBINS, M.D., CHAIR, DEPARTMENT OF FAMILY MEDICINE AND COMMUNITY HEALTH, TUFTS UNIVERSITY SCHOOL OF MEDICINE Mr. Regula. Dr. Anthony Robbins, you get the blue ribbon for patience this morning. I'm sorry we couldn't get to you sooner, but as you can tell, there was a lot of testimony. You're the Chairman of the Department of Family Medicine and Community Health--where, it doesn't tell me. Dr. Robbins. I'm sorry. It's at Tufts University in Boston, Massachusetts. Mr. Regula. Okay. And you want to talk about public health. Dr. Robbins. I'd like to talk about public health. I spent most of my career in public health, in government, State and Federal. Actually before I go to the core of my statement, perhaps I could just say to you how sad it is to be in front of this Committee without Silvio Conte here. He was a great advocate for public health and we miss him. The President's budget that you're considering today is problematic for efforts to improve the health of Americans. I want to make just two key points and then a lot of the illustrations are in my written testimony and we can go to those questions if you'd like. Expansion at NIH has great merit. But to expand NIH alone is shortsighted public policy. It's already clear that many Americans are not in a position to benefit from scientific advances in medicine and public health. The budget will increase the likelihood that under-served citizens, the elderly, the needy, and rural Americans will never benefit fully from NIH research. As we saw last week with the introduction of this new leukemia drug, when we rely on commercial firms to exploit research results borne of Government investment, lifesaving products may be beyond the financial reach of many Americans. Investment at NIH must be balanced with full drug coverage under Medicare and expansion of health programs to help the under-served. And that point really refers particular to the programs of HRSA and to the programs of the Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration. That's point one. The second point refers to how public health works in our Federal system, where protecting the health of the public is principally in the domain of States. But we have wisely built federal programs that now provide the critical glue that holds State public health efforts together. Any weakening of the Federal public health programs will be far more damaging than the reduced Federal budget numbers might indicate. State and city programs will not be able to provide adequate protection for their people against tuberculosis, lead poisoning, or asthma, for example. We in New England, where we've been dealing with the West Nile virus problem will probably not have the resources we need. If you look at the history of this, since the Michael Debakey Commission on Heart Disease, Cancer and Stroke reported in 1965 that the benefits of biomedical research were not reaching all Americans, the gulf between investment and research and the application of the results has actually widened. Since that time, there is a wide body of evidence that early detection and intervention can reduce the burden of illness and disability on our aging population. As a consequence of our failure to assure the broad distribution of health advances produced by NIH research, many Americans, particularly the poor, those who live in rural areas, and the elderly, become sick and disabled and die unnecessarily. Two health agencies of the Department of Health and Human Services, HRSA and SAMHSA, define their mission in terms of improving health and services for under-served Americans. To the life saving programs of these two agencies the President's budget would inflict serious damage. Then in the written testimony I describe what happens in the community access program and the rural health program, the Bureau of Health Professions, Maternal and Child Health Block Grant and Ryan White, poison centers and the mental health grants to communities. I follow a witness who has spoken about the increase of 10.6 percent for the community and migrant health centers. And the President is to be commended for that. But that represents only a small part of the overall HRSA budget which would decline overall, including the increase for health centers, by 10.4 percent. At SAMHSA, the targeted capacity program to which a small amount of money has been added isn't growing nearly rapidly enough. The agency itself estimated that 2.9 million people are left out in terms of getting services from this program, from these targeted areas. Yet the budget would cover 17,000 new people or only .06 percent of what the agency says is needed. Now, let me go to the Centers for Disease Control and sort out the constitutional issue that States retain the prime responsibility for protecting and improving the health of their people. State health departments delegate some of their responsibility to city and local health departments. I used to, when I was a State health officer, first in Vermont and then in Colorado, I was always reminding the Feds, as we called them, that we in the States have the prime responsibility. But in truth, in modern society, threats to health have outgrown the capacity of State and local health departments to respond without Federal help. Pathogens and toxic chemicals cross borders. People cross borders. And public health responses must as well. The Federal Government has responded very well historically, with important assistance, help in gathering data and surveillance, laboratory supportto stay ahead of threats to health, and would help building capacity and purchasing power, and help developing new programs where the science has made it possible. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention have grown to become the critical Federal public health assistance program. Yet CDC's overall programs are being cut back in a number of areas. The chronic disease and health promotion program would be cut back by $174 million in the proposed budget, cutting back on cervical and breast cancer screening, heart disease and stroke, the diabetes program and many others. There's new technology that is finally letting us look at environmental hazards by seeing how people are exposed. Yet the Center for Environmental Health would see a diminution in its budget. Vaccine purchases, which have become a very important part of Federal assistance to States, I guess it goes up a little bit, but the fact is that the cost of vaccines to vaccinate one child fully will almost double next year because of the addition of a wonderful new vaccine that comes out of NIH research. The pneumococcal vaccine, which is effective against one of the major causes of meningitis, and the blood borne pneumococcal infections in infants, costs a lot of money. And the new budget does not incorporate enough funding to continue to cover the same number of kids with these vaccine purchases. I mentioned asthma, where we have a national epidemic and where in fact we're finally getting a handle on it, and yet that program is cut back. And finally, the Prevention and Health Services block grant is reduced. I urge you, and maybe this is another one of those cases where creativity will be needed, but I urge an expansion in the health programs in the rest of the Department of Health and Human Services, especially CDC, HRSA and SAMHSA, comparable to that that has been proposed by the President for the National Institutes of Health. Let me conclude with a story. About 25 years ago, I was a brash young State health officer, State health commissioner in Vermont. I joked with the head of our appropriations committee in the State house of representatives, and I told him that the budget that he was proposing for me, that there wasn't a heck of a lot I was going to be able to do about a variety of avoidable problems, and that I might just have to sit back and name the outbreaks and epidemics after the members of the committee. Now, Em Hebard was really very supportive and used my joke, I guess, to help bring the budget up to a reasonable level. I guess I would conclude by hoping that you can do as well by my colleagues in the Public Health Service and for the people of the country. Thank you. [The justification follows:] [GRAPHIC(S) NOT AVAILABLE IN TIFF FORMAT] Mr. Regula. Do we get to pick our disease? Dr. Robbins. Oh, I guess so. [Laughter.] Mr. Obey. Tony, good to see you. Just a couple of questions. First of all, would you expand on what this new PCV vaccine? Would you give us a little more information about what would happen in terms of numbers of kids who would actually be covered by all the vaccines they need if we stuck to the President's budget? How many kids are going to be left out? Dr. Robbins. Well, I can only, I can guess---- Mr. Obey. Why is it important? Dr. Robbins. Let me go back to the vaccine, because this is a very good story. We have had in the last 20 years three major vaccine successes. All the other vaccines are older than that. But first there was the hepatitis B vaccine and now hepatitis A vaccines. These were developed out of research efforts and brought to market and included in the universal vaccine programs. The most magnificent success was the hemophilus influenza B vaccine, where essentially this disease, which was the most common form of meningitis in children, virtually disappeared in this country. Now we're succeeding similarly in the rest of the world. The most common remaining cause of meningitis in young children is streptococcal pneumoniei, the organism that causes pneumococcal meningitis. And interestingly enough, the old vaccine that was effective in adults has been around for a long time. It was developed many, many years ago and the technical advance was producing something that would make it immunogenic, would produce an immune response in children. When that was done, they then had to produce a vaccine that covered seven different strains of pneumococci. And in doing that, this became a very expensive vaccine, sufficiently expensive so that I'm told that next year's price, this vaccine will cost as much as all the other vaccines together have been costing under the CDC purchase program. That meant in effect, if you were just going to keep the same number of children protected you were going to have to double the allocation. I think, if I remember the numbers, it's up by $73 million or about a third of the increase that would be needed to keep pace with immunization. CDC provides by bulk purchases, by making contracts with the vaccine manufacturers, I believe it's 11 States, 6 in New England plus 5 others that buy all of their vaccines for all of their children, and then the other States which buy a smaller number for the under-served, for the uninsured. This has become critical to every immunization program in the country. These programs are essentially surveillance, so you know where you've got the disease and you know how good the coverage is, organization so that you make sure that everyone is coming into health centers and health plans to be immunized, and the support of certain personnel and the purchase of vaccines. They've been magnificently successful. Mr. Obey. Thank you. I noticed in public polling, Mr. Chairman, that there's a strange gap in the public understanding of the Public Health Service and the public health agencies. When you use the term public health, what many, many Americans think you're talking about is health care delivered to the poor--Government health care for poor people. They don't realize that what the public health service does is to try to protect the health of the entire American population from serious diseases. I think if we could just find a way to make that change in people's heads it would be a whale of a lot easier to get support for some of these programs. Dr. Robbins. I'm even reminded that when you go into building one of NIH that the plaque on the wall describing the mission of the institutes includes public health. It is not simply to produce products and advances for the medical care system. That's the problem for the under-served and the poor. As we get new advances, it makes it to us, they make it to us middle class people. But without the HRSA program, without the kind of emphasis on screening and advances for diabetes treatment that CDC is pushing so effectively now, this doesn't make it to the under-served portions of the population. Mr. Obey. Thank you. Mr. Regula. Thank you, and we appreciate your patience. Very worthwhile information. The subcommittee will be in recess until 2:00 o'clock. Dr. Robbins. I should thank the staff, because I've been where you are, and you stuck it out, too.

TESTIMONY OF INTERESTED INDIVIDUALS AND ORGANIZATIONS 2002 BUDGET WITNESS DR. RENEE JENKINS, PROFESSOR AND CHAIRMAN, DEPARTMENT OF PEDIATRICS AND CHILD HEALTH, HOWARD UNIVERSITY COLLEGE OF MEDICINE Mr. Regula. Let us get started. We have a lot of witnesses today, so we want to move right along. We are sorry we cannot give you more time, but that is the way it is. You won the lottery or you wouldn't even be here because our requests for testimony are about double what we are able to accommodate, but it is very helpful to even have a brief statement to give us an opportunity to understand--especially for me because I don't have time and I hate to tell you this but I am not going to be able to read all your statements completely. That is the staff's job and I am not even sure they will get through the whole thing but we will try as much as possible to evaluate all the testimony that is presented. These topics are very important on every subject, are of great interest and affect a lot of people. We understand that very well. We have the little boxes there that the green light will go, then there will be an amber light which means you have a minute and a half to wrap up and then the red light which means stop. Francine has a little buzzer that goes off, she is the enforcer. It is a challenge to get through these and we want to give everyone a chance. Sometimes we will have a few questions. I often have a lot of questions but we just don't have time to get into depth with all of them. All of these topics are very interesting and more importantly, they affect the lives of people. We want to do the best job we can in allocating the resources to achieve hopefully successes and meeting some of the challenges of the illnesses and diseases that confront us. First we have Education. Some of you will be here on education. I just saw a poll the other day that said among the American people, education is the number one issue and close behind it is health. These are subjects that are very important to people. With that, we will get started. Our first witness today is Dr. Renee Jenkins, Professor and Chairman, Department of Pediatrics and Child Health, Howard University. I would like to welcome you. Dr. Jenkins. Thank you. I am Renee Jenkins from Howard University. I have been practicing in the Washington community for 25 years. I am also the President of the D.C. Chapter of the American Academy of Pediatrics. On behalf of the American Academy of Pediatrics and our pediatric and adolescent endorsing organizations, I would like to thank the Subcommittee for the opportunity to present this statement. Today, children are generally healthier now than they were only half a generation ago. According to recent reports, the national infant mortality and child death rates and the percentage of children living in poverty have all declined and immunization coverage rates for infants and toddlers have increased. However, despite these significant improvements, there are still over ten million children and adolescents who remain uninsured. Moreover, racial and ethnic health disparities for many children and adolescents continue to exist. We, you and I, both have more to do. As a clinician, I must work hard with my colleagues to not only diagnose and treat our patients but also to promote strong interventive interventions, to improve the overall health and well being of all infants, children, adolescents and young adults. Likewise, as a policymakers, you, along with your colleagues, have an integral part to play to improve the health of the next generation through sustained and adequate funding of vital Federal programs that support these efforts. I am going to speak on three issues particularly--access, quality, and immunizations. Under access, as a child and adolescent health clinician, we believe that all children and adolescents deserve and should have full access to quality health care, from the ability to achieve primary care for the pediatrician trained in the unique needs of children to timely access to pediatric medical subspecialists and pediatric surgical specialists should the need arise. Today, federally supported initiatives such as the Maternal Child Health Block Grant, Title X Family Planning Services and the Health Professions Education Training Grants are for many communities their only access to health care. We urge you to ensure that these and other important child and adolescent health programs receive sustained and adequate funding in fiscal year 2002. Of equal importance to access to care is an equitable Federal investment in the training and education of the Nation's future pediatricians, clinical and scientists, particularly in independent teaching hospitals. A bipartisan Congress has recognized in the last two years, and you have personally supported, maintaining adequate funding to continue the education research programs and delivery of health care in these child and adolescent-centered settings is imperative. Under quality, access to health care is only the first step in protecting the health of all children and adolescents. We must make every effort to ensure that the care provided is of the highest quality. Robust Federal support for the wide array of quality improvement initiatives is needed if this goal is to be achieved. Leading the effort to develop and implement the highestquality of care through research and better application of science is the agency for Health Care Research and Quality and the NIH, National Institutes of Health. Together, these agencies provide not only scientific knowledge and basis to cure disease, improve the quality of care, but also support emerging critical issues in health care delivery. They also address the particular needs of priority populations like children and adolescents. Continued Federal sustainable funding for health research, including pediatric research in the face of new challenges and new technology is essential to continued improvements in the quality of America's health care. Over the years, NIH has made dramatic strides that directly impact on the quality of life for infants and children. I am a recipient of an NIH grant that has definitely shown in a controlled study that one can effectively postpone and reduce early sexual involvement in young girls which is important to the issue of adolescent pregnancy prevention. We are now using the results of this research to pilot a program to educate and support parents in their efforts to work with children. We join the medical research community to support the fourth installment in the doubling of the NIH budget for fiscal year 2003. Under immunization, pediatricians working alongside public health professionals and other partners have brought the United States its highest immunization coverage levels in history. As a result, disease levels are at or near record low levels. However, the public health infrastructure that now supports our national immunization efforts must not be jeopardized with insufficient funding. One of the conclusions of the June 2000 Institute of Medicine report ``Calling the Shots,'' was that unstable funding for State immunization programs threatens vaccine safety and coverage levels for specific populations. For example, adolescents continue to be adversely affected by vaccine preventable diseases such as chicken pox, Hepatitis B, measles and Rubella. Comprehensive adolescent immunization activities at the national, State and local level are needed to achieve national disease elimination goals. As a pediatrician who sees adolescents, immunizations were generally thought to be a less critical issue in this age group. However, the recent college outbreaks of meningococcal meningitis which is a life threatening infection of the brain and spinal cord have made us much more aware of the need to be vigilant about immunization protection even in this age group. While the ultimate goal of immunization is clearly the eradication of disease, the immediate goal must be the prevention of disease in individuals or groups. To this end we strongly believe that the continued investment in the efforts of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention must be sustained and increased. In conclusion, I thank you for this opportunity to provide our recommendations for the coming fiscal year. We look forward to working with you as the new Chair of this important subcommittee, and I would like to personally invite you to the Department of Pediatrics at Howard University so that you can see child and adolescent health care at work. As this subcommittee is once again faced with difficult choices and multiple priorities, we know that as in the past years, you will not forget America's children. Thank you very much. [The information follows:] [GRAPHIC(S) NOT AVAILABLE IN TIFF FORMAT] Mr. Regula. Thank you. With a couple of small grandchildren who live down the road from me in Ohio, I have heard a lot about pediatricians. We are happy to have our colleague from California, Mr. Duke Cunningham. For those of you who don't know, Duke was the only Air Force ace in the Vietnam war, so he is not only a skilled legislator, he was a very skilled pilot, and is a very valued member of this committee. Duke is going to introduce our next witness, Carolyn Nunes from San Diego. That is your home city, isn't it, Duke. You have quite a family of educators, don't you? Mr. Cunningham. Dr. Nancy Cunningham. I have two built-in lobbyists right at home. Mr. Regula. Duke takes care of education. Mr. Cunningham. I was a Navy pilot, not an Air Force pilot. Mr. Regula. And I am a Navy man. I really missed up that one. Mr. Cunningham. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. I see my colleague, Frank Purcell in the audience. I think you are probably here with the nurse anesthetists, Frank. My wife has her doctorate degree in Education. The witness I am going to introduce is the sister of my wife, my sister-in- law in charge of Special Education in San DiegoCity Schools. She works for Alan Bursin, who was a Clinton appointee in the border and now is the Superintendent. I want to tell you he has my full support. What Carolyn is going to talk about a little bit today is not just special education but education reform in five minutes, and talk about what we are trying to do. Alan Bursin is supportive of many of the Bush initiatives for the reform of education. I am very, very proud to support her boss, the Superintendent, Alan Bursin. Carolyn testified before the Oversight Committee a couple of weeks ago on special education. She is here today to do the same thing. I have seen her cry when she can't help students with special needs. Now she is an administrator but she spent 23 years in the field of education and is trying to breach the gap between schools and the parents to make sure the parents' special needs are met with their individual children, but on the other hand, trying to breach that the school systems are not bankrupted by the local trial lawyers that are ripping off, in my opinion, the school systems and the parents. There are only two areas in which we should have caps. One is trial lawyers and the other I will leave to you to decide what it is. Carolyn has been a special education teacher and an administrator. This is the second year of implementation of the blueprint for student success that her boss, Alan Bursin, has presented. I want to tell you that on the D.C. Committee we capped lawyer fees. To give you an example, we saved $12 million. Instead of going to lawyers, it went to the children with special needs. We have done that for two terms. We hired 23 special education specialists, speech pathologists, hearing specialists, sighted specialists, and I want you to listen very carefully because we need a change in special education. Carolyn is the expert in all of San Diego City schools to bring that to you. It is my honor to introduce my sister-in-law, Carolyn Nunes. ---------- Wednesday, March 21, 2001. TESTIMONY OF PUBLIC WITNESSES 2002 BUDGET WITNESS CAROLYN NUNES, SPECIAL EDUCATION PROGRAM MANAGER, SAN DIEGO UNIFIED SCHOOL DISTRICT Ms. Nunes. Thank you. Today, my testimony focuses on some needed reforms to special education law and services in San Diego Unified School District and the Nation's school districts. Large scale reform efforts are not unfamiliar to San Diego City Schools. Currently, the District is in its first year of implementation of the Blueprint for Student Success. The reform strategies included in the blueprint are designed to improve teaching and learning for all students, including special education students while ending the practice of social promotion. Initial test score data indicates student performance is improving but much work remains to be done to successfully implement this program districtwide. For local reform efforts like the blueprint to continue to succeed, the reauthorization of the Elementary and Secondary Education Act and IDEA must make changes consistent with local reforms and provide the necessary funding to support change. The San Diego Unified School District currently serves over 142,000 students in over 184 schools. Of those, over 15,000 students have active IEPs and receive special education services; 92 percent of the special education current budget provides direct instruction and support for students with special education services. The following addresses some of our current issues regarding special education, IDEA, and funding as well as our recommendations for possible solutions. Nationally, we have witnessed an alarming increase in the number of students with autism. Families are bombarded with the latest and new forms of treatment for autism. All who view and read this information in the media make assumptions that all such services are research based and conform to best practice. There are a variety of instructional strategies and methodologies that are available. As educators, we realize that using only one instructional strategy for all students is not appropriate. More emphasis must be placed in the area of research in the educational approaches which will promote student achievement based on the student's ability and independence. School districts are currently finding the need to retrain teachers in strategies and techniques used with students with autism. We would recommend the development of special grants for the purpose of ongoing professional development for the training of certificated and classified staff in the field. Today, multiple agencies are funded by Federal dollars for providing services to students with special needs. Each of these agencies are under different rules and differentsystems. Although these agencies have a common purpose to provide services for students, these systems become a barrier. At times, although with good intentions, Federal laws will frequently promote a system of disconnect. Although Congress placed limitations on the recovery of attorneys' fees in the 1997 IDEA reauthorization, little has been done to reduce the significant roles such fees continue to play in the decisions that school districts and even parents make regarding educational programs for children with disabilities. An early independent review without all the formal requirements of a due process proceeding may temper each side's expectations and lead to a quicker and fairer resolution. I suggest mandating school districts to participate in alternate dispute resolution and all due process proceedings and reduce reimbursement of attorneys fees proportionately for parents who refuse to participate. Today, significant amounts of program monies are spent on independent educational evaluations. These evaluations are conducted at the request of parents when they disagree with the result of the school district evaluation. Under IDEA and its regulations, the school district must initiate due process proceedings and its associated costs to avoid paying for an independent evaluation. School districts have little economic incentive to request due process in challenging independent educational evaluations when such an action would prove costlier than paying for the evaluation. In my experience, special education has resulted in a system driven more by the need to comply with numerous requirements of both Federal and State laws and regulations than by the genuine educational needs of children with disabilities. The California Department of Education has developed a process of sanctioning school districts who do not meet the zero tolerance level of compliance with timelines for review of annual IEPs or three year reevaluations. This system does not provide for reporting extenuating circumstances that prevent us from meeting timelines. While our district has made great strides in electronic capture of information regarding the status of students receiving special education, 100 percent compliance is difficult to achieve. Requests for data collection and reports by various agencies at the national, State and local levels impose a strain on the district's ability to provide information in a timely manner. Our recommendations are as follows. Data collection should be allowed to report the extenuating circumstances that prevent timelines from being met. Definitions regarding placement settings, disability categories, designated and related services should be consistent across agencies. Data repositories should be developed that can be access by any interested agency from a central location. Thresholds of compliance should reflect the percentage of students reported. Special education reform cannot be done in isolation. While increased IDEA funding may reduce encroachment from the district's general fund, it is necessary to support local reform through augmenting other programs in the education budget. It is essential to support successful districtwide reform efforts that narrow the achievement gap while focusing on enhancing the education for all students. On behalf of the San Diego Unified School District, we appreciate the opportunity to comment on these issues and would offer any assistance. [The information follows:] [GRAPHIC(S) NOT AVAILABLE IN TIFF FORMAT] Mr. Regula. Do you think these regulations should be implemented by the Department of Education rather than a statutory requirement in the law? Ms. Nunes. Yes. Mr. Regula. Questions? Thank you very much. It is a very important program to a lot of parents and to their children. Hopefully, we can meet the challenge of funding. Mr. Cunningham. Thanks, sis. Mr. Regula. Next Ms. Northrup will introduce Dr. Stevan Kukic, a Member of the Board of Directors, National Center for Learning Disabilities. I might say Ms. Northrup is a valued member of this committee and very involved in education matters in the City of Louisville, Kentucky, and brings a broad range of experience as we deal with the difficult education issues. Ms. Northrup. Ms. Northrup. Thank you. It is my pleasure to introduce today Stevan Kukic of the National Center for Learning Disabilities. Dr. Kukic is currently the Vice President of Professional Services, Soppers West Education Services in Longmont, Colorado, a former Director of At Risk and Special Services for the Utah State Office of Education for 11 years. His office provided supervision for all special education services delivered tostudents with disabilities. Dr. Kukic has also provided leadership for services for students at risk, Title I, migrant education correction, youth in custody, homeless, drug and alcohol and vocational special needs. In addition, he has served on many national advisory and editorial boards and is Past President of the National Associations of State Directors of Special Education. Finally, he has been a member of the National Center for Learning Disabilities' Board of Directors since 1996 and on the NCLD's Professional Advisory Board since 1992. Dr. Kukic will talk about the subject that is especially important to me and to us all, how do we help young children develop the skills they need to have to be ready to read. Dr. Kukic. ---------- Wednesday, March 21, 2001. TESTIMONY OF PUBLIC WITNESSES 2002 BUDGET WITNESS DR. STEVAN KUKIC, MEMBER, BOARD OF DIRECTORS NATIONAL CENTER FOR LEARNING DISABILITIES Dr. Kukic. Thank you. It is my pleasure to be with you this morning. Thank you, Ms. Northrup, for that great introduction. All of us are keenly aware if we could get to problems early, we save money and we solve problems in more profound ways. The National Center for Learning Disabilities has dedicated itself through its mission to make certain that we do intervene as early as we possibly can with research based practice and that we do that so people with learning disabilities can achieve their fullest potential. That is our mission. With that in mind, we are pleased to introduce to you this possibility that you would endorse our Get Ready to Read Initiative that we have begun. This initiative is a national screening program to be used by parents of young children as well as early childhood professionals who want to promote early reading and school success. The initiative seeks to ensure that these people have research based, easy to use tools to be able to get a better handle on the kinds of problems young children have that could cause them later difficulties in reading in school. We believe at NCLD if we can accomplish the task of this initiative, we will give people the ability to be able to assess what children are experiencing in their young lives, to recognize those behaviors that will link to resources that will be able to help those children and the people who deal with them to be able to have those kids be successful. It is interesting that even with all the work we are doing in this era of standards based reform, still 30 to 40 percent of our Nation's fourth graders still do not know how to read. There is a wide variety of testing measures that are being used to try to deal with this. What is wonderful is that through the good work that has been done by the National Institutes of Health and especially the National Institute for Child Health and Human Development, we have begun to uncover what the precursors are to success in reading and school. That research has told us that there is a high correlation between the quality of early language and literacy interactions and the acquisition of linguistic skills necessary for reading. That is a very profound piece of research that should be affecting what everyone does in relationship to children, and is beginning to. It is an interesting note; parents who have children with special needs often they wait to get services. There was a recent study that suggests that 40 percent of parents wait a year or longer before they get some help. If you think of what you know about young children, waiting a year or longer is a real dilemma. Seventy-five percent of children who are not identified as having problems and having intervention by the age of nine will continue not to be able to read when they leave high school. So there is a need for research based screening and assessment and a number of complementary efforts have helped to produce the prelude to this initiative. Congress has supported a number of ongoing literacy programs to help improve the ability of children and adults in relationship to this issue. The national education goal of having all preschool kids ready to enter school and ready to learn has also been of value. It sets the stage for what we are trying to do in this Get Ready to Read Initiative. Early last year with leadership from Representative Ann Northrup and Senator Thad Cochran and NICHD, we recruited a team of experts to develop this screening tool. The tool was developed under the leadership of Grover Whitehurst and Christopher Lonigan who worked closely with NCLD staff and advisors and a 20 item screening tool was developed. It was developed using a great process of validation wherein a set of items were correlated with a well accepted goal standard assessment tool so that parents and early childhood professionals can have a screening tool they can trust. In addition, we have identified a set of resources and a set of materials these folks can use after they have done the screening so they can link not only to those resources andmaterials but to other professionals for appropriate diagnosis. The tool itself focuses on four building blocks of literacy: linguistic awareness, letter knowledge, book knowledge and emergent writing. These are all reliable predictors of early reading success. It is our goal to disseminate this tool through national partnerships. The target audience is parents, teachers, child care providers, early childhood providers and other professionals. It is our goal to saturate the field in one year and to embed the tool in the operations of early childhood service organizations. It is a tool to be used with four year olds. We have private sector partnerships, a major multimedia educational publisher that has agreed to disseminate this tool to hundreds of thousands of people. With your support, we will be able to get the initiative going and be able to do a statewide demonstration in nine States including Arizona, California, Kentucky, Maine, Maryland, Mississippi, New Jersey, New York and Washington. Mr. Regula. How do you get it to young parents that need to know. Dr. Kukic. This is going to be a paper tool as well as a web-based tool. We have a partnership with the multimedia international publisher that is helping us be able to get to several million people on the web is what they are able to get to, so we hope that will work out. I will close by saying if we work together in the private sector, in the nonprofit sector and with your support, we will be able to achieve this great goal to be sure no child is left behind. I thank you for this opportunity to speak with you. [The information follows:] [GRAPHIC(S) NOT AVAILABLE Questions? Ms. Northup. Ms. Northup. I would like to thank Dr. Kukic for being here and for the effort. There has been an amazing amount of effort to develop a tool. All the research has now told us that children can be identified as early as four or five years old as being at high risk for needing intervention to learn to read; that if they get effective intervention, we should have single digit percentages of children that don't read and read to their capacity at fourth grade. Is that correct? What you have done is actually developed the test that parents or schools could use. Dr. Kukic. That is exactly correct. This research is not equivocal, it is not a possible. I would go so far as to say it is fact, we know how to teach kids how to read, we know how to identify kids who are at risk of failure at an early age and it is a moral imperative that we do so. Ms. Northup. I would like to compare that with what is actually going on. In my district, an urban district that has a significant population of at risk based on poverty levels and so forth, at risk children that our public schools do not screen children, that a child has to be estimated by a teacher to be one year behind before they are even able to request a test. This is usually sometime in second grade. There is usually a full year's wait before your child is actually tested because of the waiting list and so it is often fourth grade before a child gets in to special education. NIH tells us that at that level, it takes an enormous amount of resources in order to catch up a child who has missed those years of learning to decode and slowly become more accurate and quick so they can get to the understanding age. Part of that is because of the enormous cost for every child discovered. With this tool, you could just screen every child and get to the remediation before they ever--they are not necessarily learning disabled, they just need intervention. Mr. Regula. Mr. Cunningham. Mr. Cunningham. Thank you. If you do that in California and San Diego, I will put it in my newsletter for you so we can put it out there to help disseminate it. I helped rewrite the IDEA bill, so I am very familiar with it, when I was on the Education Committee and authorization. One of the problems we had was parent expectations and the wrong person reaches out and a parent has a child with special needs. They want the absolute best for that child like I want for mine but many times, either a medical doctor not trained to give that diagnosis on how muchper hour or how much per week in training they receive, that parent's expectations are raised to a significant level that is unrealistic and what happens is the school is expected to poll that judgment. Then there is a conflict between the school and the parent. In your program, do you have anything that identifies say a student with dyslexia that may have a higher problem of reading than say a child without that ailment, so that parents don't get the wrong idea or at least expectations? Dr. Kukic. What I like about the screening tool that we have developed is that it is to be used with four year olds. It is a functional kind of tool rather than label-based, it is based on those prerequisite skills that all kids need if they are going to be effective readers. So the interventions that work that have been uncovered so far for those children are usually not very expensive at all. It demands a redirection of the kind of early intervention that is done for these kids as four to six year olds. If you do that well, then there is much less need for very expensive interventions later. There is a lot of a lack of knowledge among a lot of fine professionals about this issue and there is a public relations or public awareness that our chairman of the board really believes in very sincerely that people need to understand what this research is saying so we can intervene at an early age in an economical way to be able to become a nation of readers. That is the point. Mr. Cunningham. I would like to read more about the program. Mr. Regula. Thank you. Our next witness will be Dr. Judith Albino, President, California School of Professional Psychology. She will be introduced by our colleague, Mr. Cunningham. Mr. Cunningham. I would tell Dr. Albino that I have a lot tied to her programs. First of all, she has four campuses. One is Los Angeles, I was born there. Another is in San Diego, I am a member of Congress from there. Another is Fresno where I grew up at 3212 Pine Street and the other is Alameda where I sailed out on an aircraft carrier. She is going to be named the President of Alliant International University which is combining with USIU where my wife got her doctorate degree in education. It is my pleasure to introduce Dr. Albino, President, California School of Professional Psychology. The school has four different campuses, as I mentioned. She is going to be named President of a combined school system. USIU and Alliant have over 2,300 students supported by three campuses and a faculty of over 200 specialists. It supports many of the research and community service programs throughout California. I am pleased to introduce Dr. Judith Albino. I would say you will find another supporter of doubling medical research, especially with San Diego with its super computers, its biotech and its teaching universities. Thank you for coming. ---------- Wednesday, March 21, 2001. TESTIMONY OF PUBLIC WITNESSES 2002 BUDGET WITNESS DR. JUDITH E. ALBINO, PRESIDENT, CALIFORNIA SCHOOL OF PROFESSIONAL PSYCHOLOGY Dr. Albino. Thank you. I appreciate the opportunity to be here today. We are looking forward to expanding our programs in Congressman Cunningham's district and we are grateful for his leadership there. I should note that CSPP currently is headquartered in San Francisco in the district of your subcommittee colleague, Congresswoman Nancy Pelosi. I want to begin by thanking the subcommittee for its recent, very generous support of CSPP's Partners for Success Program which works with California school districts to provide teacher education with a special emphasis on the prevention of violence in the classroom. I appreciate the opportunity to testify today on the importance of providing our Nation's schools with elementary and secondary school counselors. I also am testifying in support of programs of the Health and Human Services Administration and the Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration. Last year, the subcommittee provided $30 million to continue funding for the Elementary School Counseling Demonstration Program. Legislative constraints limited this generous funding to elementary schools. Moreover, the $30 million provided can only begin to meet the needs for these services. At a time when our communities are shocked and griefstricken by incidents of violence in our schools, we have an obligation to do all that we can to provide resources to keep our schools and our students safe. School counselors are an integral part of this effort, yet America's schools are in desperate need of qualified school counselors. The current national student to counselor ratio averages 561 students to every school counselor. The maximum recommended ratio is 250 to 1. Yet, not one State in our Nation meets that recommendation. Although the increase is significant, I am recommending that $100 million be allocated to these efforts in fiscal year 2002 and that the program be expanded to secondary schools. The Surgeon General's National Action Agenda on Children's Mental Health released this past January outlines goals for improving services for the 7.5 million children under the age of 18 who need mental health services; 1 in 10 children and adolescents suffer from mental illness severe enough to cause impairment. Yet, in any given year, it is estimated fewer than 1 in 5 of these children actually receives treatment. The long term consequences of untreated childhood disorders are costly in human as well as dollar terms. Many adult Americans also face challenges that could be prevented or mitigated with behavioral and mental health counseling. These include 18 million with depressive disorders, 14 million who abuse alcohol and 13 million who use addictive drugs. In view of this need, I urge your favorable consideration of $3,150,000,000 in support of the programs of the Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration and $6,472,000,000 in support of programs of the Health Resources and Services Administration. In closing, I want to mention that CSPP trains more than half of the clinical psychologists graduated in California each year and about 15 percent of those across our country. More than 25 percent of our students come from ethnic minority backgrounds. As Congressman Cunningham indicated, CSPP students and faculty provide many hours annually of mental health services at nominal or no cost. Most recently this amounted to nearly 2 million annually. In San Diego County where there are 812,000 people with diagnosed mental health or addictive disorders, the planned construction and staffing of our new community mental health counseling center will significantly expand these services, leveraging public support with in-kind contributions in the form of the services of our faculty and doctoral students. Thank you for your time and I appreciate your support. [The information follows:] [GRAPHIC(S) NOT AVAILABLE IN TIFF FORMAT] Mr. Regula. Questions? Mr. Cunningham. One of the issues we have before this committee that affects directly is a hold harmless that follows Title I for underprivileged children. California is a payer of taxes but doesn't receive its fair share and many of the other States while they have lost population, the growth of California schools with minorities--you stated of these children having problems, 75 percent of them are minorities. We are seeking to have the hold harmless rule instated. I worked with Senator Feinstein last year to make sure that happened. That will help the schools to have the dollars possible. Secondly, my adopted son was in a substance abuse program. Dr. Samms in San Diego and they do a very good job with those children, so you have my support on the issue. When you look at Santana High School, Columbine, the drug problems we have in our schools, if we can get to these children early, it will save a lot of problems down the line. I want to thank you for your services. Dr. Albino. Thank you. I appreciate that statement. I think we all know how important it is to have the resources for these children if we are to avoid the kinds of problems we see in the schools you have mentioned and in so many others as well. They don't all make the headlines but these problems are much more prevalent than they should be. Mr. Regula. I think you are saying they are all interrelated. Dr. Albino. They are indeed. Mr. Regula. Thank you. Next, we have Mr. Pat Teberry from Ohio, a member of the Education Committee. You are doing mark up this morning, putting together the bill we are supposed to pay for. He is going to introduce Dr. Thomas Courtice, President, Ohio Wesleyan, where my daughter graduated. Mr. Teberry. Thank you. There is also another connection to Canton in your district. As you may know, Wesleyan has a strong presence in Canton. Of about 1,800 students, about 50 are from Canton and about 800 alumni in the Canton area. I welcome this opportunity to bring to your attention an issue of significance, not only to Ohio Wesleyan, but to the State of Ohio and the Nation. That is the underrepresentation of minority groups in the sciences at the undergraduate and professional levels. Dr. Tom Courtice serves as the President of Ohio Wesleyan University, an independent, undergraduate liberal arts institution, founded 159 years ago in Delaware, Ohio north of Columbus. Ohio Wesleyan is one of the top liberal arts colleges in the Nation. During his seven years as President of Ohio Wesleyan University, Dr. Courtice has served tostrengthen that institution. I am happy to share with you the fact that there are three Ohio Wesleyan alumni who are members of Congress--Congressman Hopson, Congressman Gilmore as well as Congresswoman Joanna Emerson from Missouri. The entire Ohio Wesleyan community is proud to call them their own and looking forward to working with Dr. Courtice and Ohio Wesleyan and thank you and the committee for allowing him to testify today. Mr. Regula. Dr. Courtice. ---------- Wednesday, March 21, 2001. TESTIMONY OF PUBLIC WITNESSES 2002 BUDGET WITNESS DR. THOMAS B. COURTICE, PRESIDENT, OHIO WESLEYAN UNIVERSITY Dr. Courtice. Thank you. Thank you for this opportunity to provide testimony to you and the members of the subcommittee. Ohio Wesleyan's undergraduate students represent 40 States and 54 countries bringing what is a rich diversity to our campus and it is this commitment to diversity as well as to an enduring commitment to academic excellence that has enabled us to reach and maintain the ranking as one of the top liberal arts colleges in the United States. I want to address briefly a topic that relates to both the quality of education and diversity and that is the need for increased attention to science education for currently underrepresented or minority groups. Ohio Wesleyan has long been acclaimed for its particular attention to science education. We employ some of the Nation's best science teaching faculty and we have committed considerable resources to improving our science facilities. In fact, we will soon begin new construction to expand and renovate existing science buildings and to bring our labs and classrooms up to a 21st century standard. Our commitment to exposing our students to a strong science curriculum has resulted in a doubling of the enrollments in science and math over the last ten years and a similar increase in the number of students who graduate with a Bachelor of Science Degree. In fact, 25 percent of the class of 1999 graduated with a science major and over 60 percent of that number entered directly graduate or professional schools relating to their majors. Student demand for the sciences obviously affects the resources that a particular university dedicates to its science and math departments, yet the increased commitment to the study of science and technology has also been mandated by the explosive growth of science research and its applications in our society. As this commitment to enhancing the quality of science studies grows, so too must the commitment to supply a well educated, large and diverse work force in these growing fields. Scientific, engineering and technological jobs are among the fastest growing in the workforce to the point that current demand for workers has outstripped supply. Demographic trends also inspire concern about the Nation's ability to meet its future technological work force needs. Historically, white males have made up a large fraction of U.S. scientists and engineers. However, this portion of the population has a percentage of the total work force is projected to decrease significantly in coming years as other population groups, African Americans and Hispanics are expected to make up to close to 50 percent of the U.S. work force quite soon. Unfortunately, due to a lack of financial resources, sufficient high school preparation and practicing mentors and role models, minorities are currently severely underrepresented in the science and technology fields. Ohio Wesleyan understands that a more diverse science work force means a broader science agenda bringing different perspectives to bear and producing a deeper analysis of alternatives. As we begin to enhance our own program to encourage greater minority participation in the sciences, I would ask that the Subcommittee consider funding and support for policies and programs which also constructively address similar issues. Such programs may incorporate strategies to provide students with more minority role models and mentors from both public and private sectors. According to the information gathered a few years ago by the National Center for Education, statistics on African Americans, Hispanics and Native Americans teaching in the sciences make up only 1.1 percent of all full-time college faculty. Creative initiatives could help colleges like Ohio Wesleyan broaden the base of minority faculty members and mentors in the sciences. Such programs may also incorporate more science research and other intimate learning opportunities for minority students and they may provide engaging residential sciences programs to pre- college populations. Our Nation's well being has long depended on our ability to adapt and advance with scientific and technical progress. The Federal Government should continue to spend considerable time and effort examining what actions will ensure the Nation has an adequately trained science work force in the future while using liberal arts colleges like Ohio Wesleyan as partners. We anticipate deepening our role in this effort. We look forward to sharing our experience with peer institutions across the country and with public policymakers as we discover what really works when it comes to systematically enhancing and expanding science education and career opportunities to an increasingly diverse population. Thank you for providing us the opportunity to testify before the subcommittee this morning. [The information follows:] [GRAPHIC(S) NOT AVAILABLE IN TIFF FORMAT] Mr. Regula. Do you find the students you are getting have an adequate background coming out of high schools to meet your science curriculum and I am sure you have a placement office and do you find it easy to place these students in good jobs once they complete their studies? Dr. Courtice. I think we have found they have been well prepared, particularly if they declare science as a field of study. It is just that we can't get enough to come across that threshold and declare. Placement opportunities are simply overwhelming and with a solid science background, the options for young people today are quite wide and expansive, whether graduate professional study or entering the work force immediately. Mr. Regula. Thank you. There certainly is a lot of interest in science but a precursor to that is you have to be able to read. That puts literacy right at the front end of all this. Dr. Courtice. That is why we think those pre-college programs are very important. Mr. Regula. Do you offer remedial for students coming in? Dr. Courtice. We do have remedial work in both quantitative and writing skills. We have also tried to introduce some of that work prior to the time students actually enroll on campus so they are doing that in their junior and senior years in high school. Mr. Regula. Thank you. Our next witness will be Warrick Carter, President, Columbia College, Chicago, to be introduced by our colleague, Mr. Jackson. Mr. Jackson. Thank you. Since early last year, Dr. Warrick Carter has served as President of Columbia College in my hometown of Chicago. Columbia is a private, four-year, liberal arts college specializing in the visual arts, performing arts and communications. Columbia's philosophy of hands-on, minds-on education plus their location in one of the world's most vibrant cities adds to a depth and richness of experience for all who enter its doors. From 1996 to last year, Dr. Carter served as Director of Entertainment Arts at Walt Disney Entertainment in Lake Buena Vista, Florida and from 1984 to 1996, he served as Provost, Vice President of Academic Affairs and Dean of Faculty at Berkley College of Music, Boston, Massachusetts. Dr. Carter received his Bachelors Degree in Music Education at Tennessee State University, his Masters and Doctorate in Music Education at Michigan State University. I present Dr. Warrick Carter, President of Columbia College. Mr. Regula. A couple of questions. Do you get a lot of your students from college? Mr. Carter. Yes, about three-quarters of our students come from the State of Illinois. Mr. Regula. Yesterday, thanks to Mr. Jackson, we had the Superintendent or CEO of the Chicago School system, very impressive. My question to you is are you seeing this as a result of their efforts in the public school system and the level of achievement of the students you are getting? Mr. Carter. Yes, we are. In fact, we work hand and glove with Chicago Public Schools. We offer a variety of programs that serve to train teachers specifically in science. We have an innovative approach to teaching science through the arts and we are training teachers to do so. We have received some rather outstanding accolades because of it. It has changed the whole quality of science instruction in the public schools. Mr. Regula. Thanks to Mr. Jackson, I will be meeting with the CEO this evening. I was impressed with what is being done and certainly Mr. Jackson has related a lot of this to me. So you are telling me the system is working? Mr. Carter. The system is working, working much better than it worked before. Mr. Regula. Thank you. ---------- Wednesday, March 21, 2001 TESTIMONY OF PUBLIC WITNESSES 2002 BUDGET WITNESS WARRICK CARTER, PRESIDENT, COLUMBIA COLLEGE Mr. Carter. Thank you for that introduction and your time. You have a lot of friends at Columbia College and we look forward to seeing you soon. I am Warrick L. Carter, President of Columbia College. Thank you for this opportunity to speak to you. As Congressman Jackson said, Columbia College is a private, nonprofit, undergraduate and graduate institution in Chicago's South Loop neighborhood that offers educational programs and arts in the communications disciplines within a context of liberal arts. With a fall enrollment of over 9,000 students, we are the fifth largest private institution in the State of Illinois. I am here to speak about the many needs of institutions of higher education, particularly those of urban colleges and universities like Columbia College and how Federal programs can help address some of these needs. Columbia College is one of the very few open arts administration institutions in the United States and has the largest minority enrollment of any institution of its kind in the country. We enroll students from across the country, across the world but it is primarily an Illinois and Chicago institution. More than three-quarters of Columbia College students are from the State of Illinois and the majority of these are from Chicago and the Chicago metropolitan area. A third of the college's students are African Americans, Latino or Asian Americans and a large number of all of our students are first in their family to attend college. Delivering excellent higher education with open admission in a very diverse urban setting is exhilarating but full of challenges. City kids, minority kids, first generation college kids are much more likely than their peers to drop out before they complete college. The loss of these kids, to their families, to Chicago and to the country is staggering. Helping students to stay in college and complete their degree at Columbia is our most important challenge. The U.S. Department of Education funds a number of programs that are of critical importance to retention at Columbia College, Chicago and to urban colleges and universities in general. The Pell Grant Program is first and foremost amongst these. At Columbia, nearly one-third of our undergraduate students receive Pell grants and are eligible to participate in the matching grant programs supplied by the State of Illinois. Although these grants do not cover the full cost of tuition and fees, without them, many of these students could not attend college at all. Title III and the Fund for the Improvement of Post Secondary Education are also vital to this effort. Currently at Columbia, Title III funds a multifaceted, academic and social support program for lower income, first generation and minority students. These funds support a comprehensive, all college effort to enhance and improve the first year experience of all new students. Research shows from around the country that the first year, even the first semester, and sometimes the first week of a student's experience in college will determine the likelihood that they will stay in college and ultimately graduate. In 1999, the college adopted a comprehensive retention program that focused on new freshmen which holistically addresses the interwoven factors that affect students' success. We received a $500,000 grant from the Department to support this initiative. In just one year, the percentage of freshmen returning to their sophomore year climbed by five percent. This past fall, 90 percent of all at risk students who participated in a summer program we refer to as our summer bridge program returned for a second semester. Columbia is now hoping to undertake an ambitious mentoring program for our minority students. Under the program, all new entering minority students will be paired with a faculty member or staff mentor to help students determine his or her own educational goals, negotiate the new and unfamiliar college experience, and to utilize student services, and hopefully develop this ongoing bond that is soimportant to be connected to an institution and to stay until completion. As mentoring has proven to be a very effective retention tool, this program will reinforce new students' decisions to attend college and quickly integrate these minority students into the academic, artistic and social fiber of the college. A sense of community is vital to retention and to providing a rich educational environment as well. Campuses such as Columbia are diffused and less contained than traditional college campuses. Fewer students live on campus and many commute daily throughout the metropolitan area. Although our dozen plus buildings are interspersed with residential, retail, commercial make us a major landowner within the area, we have only what can be defined as a loosely defined campus. The college hopes to counteract this with a new Student and Art Center that will create a focal point for our campus and for diverse community groups in the South Loop that we serve, private, nonprofit. We have the largest program of film studies in the country with 1,700 students, one of the largest programs in television and radio and recording technology. Our alums have gone on to rather well heights and others stay in the area. We have alums in California who are Academy Award winners, one for saving Private Ryan and Schindler's List, so we are proud of the quality of what we do in film and television. Mr. Regula. It is a growing industry. Mr. Carter. We found in Chicago a lot of independent films are moving away from Los Angeles because it is more cost effective to do films outside, so we see the industry growing in Chicago. There was over $150 million spent in Chicago last year in films and television shows. In Orlando, where I spent time recently, we did some $500 million worth of films. Compare that with what is going on in California, slowly but surely people are looking to do films outside of California. We think our alums are partly leading that charge. We have two who have chosen to return to Chicago and do their films there. The very recent film, Men of Honor, was done there and prior to that Soul Food, also the television program. Each case, they chose to return to their hometown and therefore create employment for our alums as well as for others in the city. Mr. Regula. That is a great impact. Do you interact with the National Endowment for the Arts? Mr. Jackson. Yes, we do. We have been fortunate to receive both NEA and NEH funding. Mr. Regula. Do you think they do a good job? Mr. Jackson. Yes. If that funding were a bit larger, I think they would do a much better job. Mr. Regula. I knew that was coming. [Laughter.] Thank you. [The information follows:] [GRAPHIC(S) NOT AVAILABLE IN TIFF FORMAT] Wednesday, March 21, 2001. TESTIMONY OF PUBLIC WITNESSES 2002 BUDGET WITNESS MARILYN HELD, DIRECTOR, LABORATORY SUPPORT SERVICES, ST. JOHN HEALTH SYSTEM, DETROIT Next is Ms. Kilpatrick from the great State of Michigan where they have a better football team than Ohio State, but times will change, is going to introduce Marilyn held, Director of Laboratory Support Services, St. John Health System, Detroit. Ms. Kilpatrick. Thank you for allowing us to present our constituents and for you to take the time to consider them. We appreciate it. I would like to present to you Ms. Marilyn Held, Director of Laboratory Support Services at St. John Health Systems in Detroit; a prominent member of the American Society of Clinical Pathologists; and has served as a board member on that society, has served on the Finance and Planning Committee and has been awarded the Distinguished Service Award from the Society in 1999. Ms. Held received her Bachelor's Degree at the University of South Dakota, performed her medical technology internship at the University of Iowa and completed her graduate education in Microbiology at the University of Arizona. I am happy to present Ms. Held. I have three 10 o'clock assignments this morning, Transportation being next door. I am happy to be with you this morning and Foreign Operations in a totally other building. Please excuse me if I am not able to stay with you. Mr. Regula. I have some interest in a few projects in Transportation so we will be very nice to you. Ms. Kilpatrick. Thank you. Ms. Hill. Ms. Held. Thank you for your support of the laboratory community and back home in Michigan. We appreciate it. Ms. Kilpatrick. Thank you. Ms. Held. Thank you for inviting me to represent the American Society of Clinical Pathologists. The ASCP has 75,000 members and is the world's largest organization representing pathologists and laboratory personnel. I am here to inform you today that the United States is facing a very serious shortage of medical laboratory personnel. Vacancy rates for 7 of 10 key laboratory medicine positions is at an all time high. ASCP in conjunction with an independent polling firm conducts a biannual wage and vacancy survey of 2,500 medical laboratory managers. The data for 2000 was published this month and I would like to give you a glimpse of what we found. Vacancy rates for cytotechnologists, the professionals who perform pap smears, in the northeast, the vacancy rate was 45 percent, 16.7 percent for the east north central and 33.3 percent for the far west, rural areas average a 20 percent vacancy rate and large cities a rather surprising 28.3 vacancy rate. Histotechnologists, the individuals who prepare tissue specimens, have an average vacancy rate of over 20 percent, the west, south central region of the country has a 73.7 percent vacancy rate; the south central Atlantic States have an average vacancy rate of 16.7 percent. By comparison, the vacancy rate for medical technologists will not appear to be of concern but it is. Medical technology vacancy rates average 11.1 percent but rural areas are at 21.1 percent. Rather than continue to quote statistics, I would like to put a face on these numbers. It is estimated that 70 percent of diagnostic and treatment decisions for patients are based on laboratory tests. In my own institution, our laboratory will perform over 10 million diagnostic tests next year alone. Tests such as measuring cardiac enzymes for heart attacks, performing prostate biopsies, hemoglobin electrophoresis for the diagnosis of sickle disease and trait and measurements for high calcium levels in blood and urine to assess future risk for osteoporosis are only a few examples. In my hospital, we have as of yesterday, a 12.4 percent vacancy rate of those personnel that assess cardiac enzymes and osteoporosis related tests and a 19 percent vacancy rate for people who prepare prostate and breast tissue for biopsies. One of the logical solutions to this vacancy rate problem is to train more students. However, the number of programs are decreasing. In my home State, we have seen the number of programs plummet from 27 to 8 in less than two decades. Nationwide, the number of graduates in medical technology has decreased 30 percent in the five years. The continued demand for laboratory services is real and is expected to grow. Given the country's aging population, the number and complexity of biopsy specimens, tests and the use of molecular techniques will increase in the next decade. Laboratory professionals who entered the work force in the 1960s and the 1970s will be retiring soon. Also, the threat of bioterrorism and emerging infectious diseases calls for trained laboratory professionals to respond. There are solutions to these problems. There are allied health grants available to attract laboratory professionals to the field especially minorities and individuals in rural and under served communities. For example, the University of Nebraska Medical Center established medical technology education sites in rural Nebraska under an Allied Health Project Grant. As of 1999, of 69 graduates, 99 percent took their first job in a rural community and 74 percent took their first job in rural Nebraska. The grants are also designed to create successful minority recruiting and retention programs for medical technologists. As a direct result of this Federal support, the University of Maryland, Baltimore, as of the fall 2000, reached a 64 percent minority student enrollment at a majority institution, one of the highest in the country. Most Allied Health Grant projects continue after Federal funding ends, making them a long lasting worthwhile investment in the future of allied health. The Allied Health Project Grants Program is a relatively small step in assuring that funding is available to attract individuals to the allied health professions. It needs to be seriously considered. Thank you for your time. We are requesting $21 million. [The information follows:] [GRAPHIC(S) NOT AVAILABLE IN TIFF FORMAT] Mr. Regula. Why do you think there aren't more young people, certainly the opportunities are enormous? Why don't young people elect this field? Ms. Held. We have looked at that a lot and the field requires a good background in math and science. We are finding that with the opportunities in computers, the .coms, the biotech corporations that there are many opportunities now that people just aren't going into health care as frequently. Mr. Regula. Do you get information out to high schools so that young people can think about this as a career? Ms. Held. Yes. The American Society of Clinical Pathologists has partnered with organizations like the National Biology Teachers Association and we do work with recruitment in those sort of forums. Independently, my organization like other hospitals, goes to high schools, middle schools, elementary schools whenever we are given the opportunity. Mr. Regula. Is St. John a free-standing organization that provides services to a number of hospitals? Ms. Held. Yes. St. John Health System is a seven hospital, integrated delivery network and three of our hospitals are in Detroit and four in the neighboring suburbs and out in the rural areas as well. Mr. Regula. So it is a consortium that all seven can use? Ms. Held. Right. Mr. Regula. Thank you for coming. ---------- Wednesday, March 21, 2001. TESTIMONY OF PUBLIC WITNESSES 2002 BUDGET WITNESS DEBORAH A. CHAMBERS, PRESIDENT-ELECT & MEMBER OF THE BOARD OF DIRECTORS, AMERICAN ASSOCIATION OF NURSE ANESTHETISTS Next is Deborah Chambers, President-elect and Member of the Board of Directors, American Association of Nurse Anesthetists. Welcome. Ms. Chambers. My name is Deborah Chambers. As President- elect of the American Association of Nurse Anesthetists, I represent 29,000 certified registered nurse anesthetists across the country, also known as CRNAs. We deliver safe anesthesia care to patients in every State, every day. I will summarize four points: what do CRNAs do and where, the nursing shortage and the CRNA shortage, our appropriations request and one regulatory issue of interest to Congress. America's 29,000 CRNAs provide two-thirds of all the anesthetics in the United States. We are the sole anesthesia provider in over 70 percent of rural hospitals. We are the predominant anesthesia provider in rural and urban under served areas of communities and to the military. For over 100 years, nurse anesthetists have been providing anesthesia. The Institute of Medicine reports anesthesia is 50 times safer today than it was 20 years ago. We believe this is in part due to our advanced training and our continuing education and recertification requirements that are by far the most rigorous in the field of anesthesia care. Yet, as more Americans become eligible for Medicare, there are fewer nurses and CRNAs to care for them. It is in America's interest to work together so that nurses and CRNAs are available for patients who need care. The nursing shortage is here today. Student nurse anesthetists must have practiced as a nurse for at least two or more years so we are deeply concerned that the number of registered nurses under the age of 35 has fallen by more than 50 percent over the last 20 years to a level less than 20 percent of all registered nurses in the country. Our 82 accredited nursing anesthesia programs are full but they are graduating about 700 fewer nurse anesthetists per year than what HHS says is required to meet the demand. The demand is growing and creating a CRNA shortage in the marketplace. In 1999, the State of North Carolina reported 82 CRNA position vacancies and it is projected these vacancies will extend to beyond 133 by the year 2004. Today, the number of classified ads advertising and recruiting for nurse anesthetists published in our national journals is growing month by month. What should we do? We should work together to educate more CRNAs. With such shortage helping to support the education of nurse anesthetists is much more cost effective for taxpayers than subsidizing other types of anesthesia providers. The committee has shown real leadership and we are asking for that leadership to continue. We commend the committee for providing significant increases for nursing education programs in fiscal year 2001, especially for the advanced education nursing program within HHS's Bureau of Health Professions. For fiscal year 2002, we recommend an increase of $11 million for advanced education nursing to at least $70 million. We note that the President's fiscal year 2002 blueprint identifies this type of program to help alleviate the nursing shortage. We recommend an increase of at least $10 million to the Nursing Education Loan Repayment Program. We urge an increase in the National Institute for Nursing Research budget up to $125 million. We also recommend that the committee consider funding specific initiatives to help expand existing CRNA schools, establish new schools and to recruit and retain faculty for the training of nurse anesthetists. While America's existing nursing anesthesia schools are full, expanding these schools or establishing new ones without Federal funding as a catalyst has proven to be very difficult. We look forward to working with the members of the committee on this project. We recommend the committee permit Medicare's new anesthesia care rule to take effect. Published on January 18, 2001, this important Medicare rule lets States decide the issue of physician supervision for nurse anesthetists. This rule gives States and hospitals the flexibility they need to provide superior health care to patients. It is supported by hospitals, nursing organizations and the National Rural Health Association, many members of the House and Senate and many members of this panel on both sides of the aisle. Secretary Thompson has signed an order to have the rule take effect on May 18, 2001. This should be a matter for the States which govern health professional scope of practice. This concludes my remarks. I welcome your questions. [The information follows:] [GRAPHIC(S) NOT AVAILABLE IN TIFF FORMAT] Mr. Regula. Is this group licensed by medical boards in each of the States? Ms. Chambers. Your licensed as a registered nurse through the State and you are certified by the National Association. Mr. Regula. So you get your nursing license from the State and certification is national? Ms. Chambers. Yes, sir. Mr. Regula. Can you move from State to State? Ms. Chambers. As long as you have license as a registered nurse from that State. The certification is the national certification so you can move. Mr. Regula. Do some States require a doctor be present and others not? I have heard that is an issue. Ms. Chambers. The whole can of worms is that nurse anesthetists practice along with physicians. Obviously in the surgical arena, a nurse anesthetist is present to provide anesthesia for a patient undergoing a surgical procedure. The difference comes in that States rules and regs differ from State to State so there are actually 29 States that do not require supervision of a nurse anesthetist. What we are asking is to let the States decide. Mr. Regula. Thank you. Mr. Jackson. Mr. Jackson. No questions. Mr. Regula. Thank you for coming. Next, Mr. Jackson will introduce Miguelina Leon, Director, Government Relations and Public Policy, National Minority AIDS Council. Mr. Jackson. Since 1994, Miguelina Ileana Leon has served as the Director of Government Relations and Public Policy for the National Minority AIDS Council. She is a certified social worker with a Masters from Columbia University and she has worked in HIV AIDS services in advocacy since 1985. Established in 1987, NMAC is the leading national membership organization addressing the HIV AIDS epidemic among communities of color. With a membership of over 600 organizations and 3,000 affiliates, NMAC provides training, technical assistance and policy analysis for community-based organizations on the front lines of the HIV AIDS epidemic. NMAC's most recent advocacy work focuses on the elimination of ethnic and racial health disparities with a special focus on the disproportionate HIV AIDS incidence and death rates among ethnic minorities. NMAC has worked with the Congressional Black Caucus to address the state of emergency of HIV AIDS in the African American community, helping to secure $156 million in Federal funding for highly impacted communities of color in 1998, $250 million in 1999 and $350 million last year. Mr. Chairman and members of the subcommittee, I present Ms. Miguelina Ileana Leon. Wednesday, March 21, 2001. TESTIMONY OF PUBLIC WITNESSES 2002 BUDGET WITNESS MIGUELINA LLEANA LEON, DIRECTOR, GOVERNMENT RELATIONS AND PUBLIC POLICY NATIONAL MINORITY AIDS COUNCIL Ms. Leon. Thank you, Congressman Jackson, for that very comprehensive presentation. My name is Miguelina Ileana Leon. I am testifying today on behalf of the National Minority AIDS Council. I would like to thank the members of the subcommittee for your extraordinary leadership and commitment to HIV AIDS prevention and care programs, biomedical and behavioral research and other crucial health programs. NMAC commends the leadership and the foresight of the Congressional Black Caucus and the Congressional Hispanic Caucus in crafting and expanding the minority aids initiative to assure a targeted response to the growing HIV AIDS health disparities among communities of color. Our work as health advocates and HIV service providers has been strengthened by your combined efforts and generous support. Our Nation has made remarkable progress in combating HIV AIDS in the last decade, however, the dynamic nature and evolving epidemic represents complex challenges and requires intensified efforts to respond. The disproportionate impact of HIV on communities of color is not a new phenomena, yet the trends over the last decade clearly reflect a growing burden of morbidity and mortality among ethnic and racial minorities. Consider these facts, people of color make up 56 percent of the cumulative AIDS cases and 68 percent of the new AIDS cases report by the Centers for Disease Control through June 2000. Men of color accounted for 63 percent of the new AIDS cases and women of color accounted for 82 percent of the new AIDS cases among females. Similarly, children of color represented 84 percent of the pediatric AIDS cases. Most recently, young men of color and women of color have become highly vulnerable. Just a few weeks ago, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention released a survey of young men which looked at over 2,000 gay and bisexual young men in Los Angeles, Miami, New York and Seattle. This survey showed that the highest infection rates were among African Americans, 30 percent, and Latinos, 15 percent. The CBC Minority AIDS Initiative was developed in 1999 to target funds to eliminate the persistent HIV AIDS related health disparities among ethnic and racial minorities. The CBC Initiative continues to be needed now more than ever. The initiative is intended to expand the infrastructure and capacity in minority community-based organizations to provide quality HIV prevention interventions and medical and supportive services. By building infrastructure and increasing the capacity of these organizations, the initiative enables the organizations to access needed funding to build their own programs in their own communities. The CBC Initiative is not intended to create a parallel system of programs or services. It does put in place HIV AIDS services in communities that have been historically underserved and also complements existing HIV prevention and health care services. These resources are intended to provide a bridge that will enable minority community-based organizations to ultimately broader Federal HIV AIDS funding. The CBC Minority Initiative cannot stand alone and we know it must work in conjunction with other HIV AIDS programs. However, we believe it is necessary to expand this initiative to a level of $540 million in fiscal year 2002 in order to support and expand the infrastructure of minority community- based organizations and to ensure that we address the health disparities by enabling these organizations to provide culturally competent services within their own communities. We believe it is important to commit to this effort, to sustain these efforts and we strongly recommend the Subcommittee sustain, safeguard and expand the CBC Minority AIDS Initiative by providing the additional funding in fiscal year 2002. Thank you for your attention and consideration of these issues. [The information follows:] [GRAPHIC(S) NOT AVAILABLE IN TIFF FORMAT] Mr. Regula. Do you work in the area of prevention as well as curative approaches? Ms. Leon. Yes. Actually, we are a national organization and we provide training and technical assistance and support to organizations on the front line of the epidemic. They actually are working in prevention and supportive services, and also providing health services. Mr. Regula. Is there some growing success in treatment? Ms. Leon. There definitely have been great advances in treatment over the last ten years. However, what we see in relationship to ethnic and racial minorities is that they don't experience the same benefits in terms of health outcomes for a variety of reasons, including they have less access to quality health services, greater numbers of uninsured people and there is a large proportion of ethnic and racial minorities that have been traditionally hard to reach populations such as the homeless, people who have chemical dependency problems and women. Mr. Regula. Other questions? I see we have a vote. I think we can take one more before we have to vote. We will have Mr. Phil Jacobs, President, BellSouth Corporation. ---------- Wednesday, March 21, 2001. TESTIMONY OF PUBLIC WITNESSES 2002 BUDGET WITNESS PHIL JACOBS, PRESIDENT, BELLSOUTH CORPORATION Mr. Jacobs. I am Phil Jacobs, President of Georgia Operations for BellSouth Corporation and also a graduate of Dennison University in Granville, Ohio. Thank you for the opportunity to be here. I am here today on behalf of a group called Friends of CDC to discuss infrastructure funding for the Centers of Disease Control and Prevention construction budget in the 2002 budget. Let me begin by offering my thanks to this subcommittee on behalf of the Friends of CDC for securing the appropriations in this year's budget of $175 million. This was an enormous step forward and a great step forward to begin the construction of new facilities at both of our campuses for the CDC in Atlanta. It is just that, a start. I am here today to respectfully ask this committee to continue to support averting what I believe is a pending crisis waiting to happen in health care. The current infrastructure of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention in Atlanta has dilapidated buildings that are creating a hazardous situation for our world class scientists. This situation must be corrected. It is clear to me if we are going to continue to have the world's leading health organization to be able to address the myriad of health issues that are coming at us today, we need to have first class facilities and need to continue to recruit first class scientists into those facilities. Before I tell you more specifically about the facilities in Atlanta, let me take a minute and talk about the organization, Friends of CDC and how we began. The Friends of CDC is a group of corporate citizens who joined together about two years ago to highlight the need for infrastructure funding for the CDC in Atlanta. This group includes not only my company, BellSouth, but also UPS, Home Depot, Delta Airlines, Cox Communications, the Southern Company, Healtheon Web/MD, Merck, HCA, the Health Care Company, General Electric and Aetna Insurance Company. It is a voluntary, civic-minded group deeply concerned with the facilities situation at the Nation's premiere health institution and we are concerned that this institution's facilities have been allowed to deteriorate to the point they have today. I personally first visited the CDC in Atlanta in 1999 but I never imagined what I would see in terms of the horrific conditions in the buildings there. By the way, I would like to extend to any member of this subcommittee an invitation to join us in Atlanta for a tour of the facilities because I will tell you now that words can't do justice to the lack of and horrific conditions that we are asking our folks to work in. Mr. Regula. The $170 million that was put in last year, will that provide some help? Mr. Jacobs. Some relief, absolutely. As a matter of fact, we just had the opening of a new facility on the Emory University Campus which gave us an additional number of level four laboratories which is where the highest security and most dangerous agents are dealt with. However, there are a host of other facilities that are still housed in inadequate housing that need to be addressed. This $250 million we are asking for this year is part of an overall $1 billion program that will bring us basically to the 21st century. Mr. Regula. Your company is contributing? Mr. Jacobs. Financially contributing? Mr. Regula. Yes? Mr. Jacobs. To the Friends of CDC organization, we are all contributors to that organization. Mr. Regula. So there is local help and support in addition to the Federal money? Mr. Jacobs. The money we are contributing which is a small amount actually goes towards our efforts in creating public awareness around this. There is no contribution to actual construction of the buildings. As you know, the role of the CDC over the past few years has continued to expand, addressing a group of areas, including infectious diseases, HIV and AIDS, tuberculosis and since 1973, the CDC has discovered more than 35 new deadly viruses and bacteria that create human health hazards. In addition to infectious diseases, they also work on preventing chronic diseases such as cardiovascular, cancer and diabetes. Other activities include the maximization of immunization rates for children, preventing a wide range of environmental diseases by preventing exposure to toxic chemicals and protecting employees from workplace injuries and disease. I would not allow any of my employees to operate in that kind of an environment. Quite frankly, if the same Federal and State health and workplace requirements were applied to this facility, it would be shut down. Let me say that the Parasitic Disease Laboratory which is one of the laboratories that has not yet been updated under this plan, are in temporary wooden barracks that were built in the 1940s, with a lifespan expectancy of 15 years. We are now 45 years beyond that life expectancy. We have regular occurrences where, for example, refrigeration units fall through the floor; where power is inadequate and shut down periodically. We even had a incidence recently where we lost samples in a refrigeration unit, because the power system could not adequately supply the building. Mr. Regula. Let me tell you, our committee is going down there in about a week or shortly thereafter and visit the facility. Mr. Jacobs. Right. Mr. Regula. So I am sure we will be given an opportunity to see some of the deficiencies. Mr. Jacobs. Thank you; we look forward to having you down here. Mr. Regula. Do you have much more, sir? Mr. Jacobs. No, I will just close by simply saying that last was an excellent start, with $175 million, and we respectfully request that the $250 million be put in this year's budget. Thank you. [The information follows:] [GRAPHIC(S) NOT AVAILABLE IN TIFF FORMAT] Mr. Regula. Well, we thank you and all the companies that expressed an interest in this. Hopefully, maybe they can make some financial contributions to help get the job done, and we appreciate that. Mr. Jacobs. Thank you. Mr. Regula. The committee will recess. We have a one minute vote, which is in process now, and then three five minute votes. So I would say roughly ten after or a quarter after, we will reconvene, as we can get the votes over with. So if you all will be patient, we will go and do our duty. [Recess.] Mr. Regula. We will reconvene the committee. Mr. Jackson, I think you want to introduce your guest here. Mr. Jackson. Mr. Chairman, Linda Anderson has served as President and Chief Operating Officer for the Sickle Cell Disease Association of America, Incorporated, since 1992. During her eight year tenure, the Pittsburgh native and Carnegie Mellon graduate has used her 24 years of corporate management experience to position SCDAA as a source of services and support for individuals and families affected by sickle cell disease. Ms. Anderson was instrumental in developing and implementing a five year strategic plan, designed to strengthen the infrastructure of the 64 member association, promote the association's national programs, and heighten public awareness. Ms. Anderson is also active on several national boards or committees, including Vice Chair, Executive Committee, Community Health Charities, and the President's Committee on the Employment of People with Disabilities. Mr. Chairman and members of the subcommittee, Ms. Anderson. ---------- Wednesday, March 21, 2001. THE SICKLE CELL DISEASE ASSOCIATION OF AMERICA WITNESSES LYNDA K. ANDERSON, PRESIDENT/COO, SCDAA, THE SICKLE CELL DISEASE ASSOCIATION OF AMERICA TAHIRA YVONNE GIVHAN Ms. Anderson. Thank you very, very much, Congressman Jackson. On behalf of the Sickle Cell Disease Association of America, I want to thank you, Chairman Regula and members of the subcommittee, for giving me this opportunity to testify. With me today, I have Tahira Yvonne Givhan, the 2000/2001 national poster child, our junior ambassador, for the Sickle Cell Disease Association of America. She is our star. Tahira will be speaking with you today on the challenges that she faces in life, because of having sickle cell anemia, an inherited genetic disease. Before Tahira delivers her remarks, I would like to briefly summarize the SCDAA's fiscal year 2002 appropriations request. First, we ask that $4 million be provided to support a two part community outreach demonstration. Specifically, $2 million is requested from the Maternal Child Health Block Grant. Special projects of regional and national significance account to support the strengthening and expansion of locally-based newborn screening follow-up activities; and $2 million is requested from the Office of Minority Health, or another account within the Health Resources Services Administration, to support the strengthening and expansion of locally-based related outreach and supportive service efforts. Second, we support the efforts underway at the National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute, to strengthen data coordination efforts of the ten comprehensive sickle centers, and seek increased resources for the establishment of a clinical research network. We ask that increased funding and report language in support of this effort be included in the fiscal year 2001 Labor HHS Education Appropriation Bill. A more detailed outline of these requests has been submitted for the record. However, now I would like for Tahira to tell you why, in her words, these resources are so desperately needed. Mr. Regula. Well, Tahira, we are happy to welcome you. I can see why you chose her. She is a very pretty young lady. Ms. Givhan. Thank you. Mr. Regula. So we will be pleased to hear your testimony, Tahira. What grade are you in? Ms. Givhan. Fourth. Mr. Regula. Fourth grade, and where do you go to school? Ms. Givhan. Oak Mountain Intermediate School. Mr. Regula. What city is that? Ms. Givhan. Shelby County. Mr. Regula. Well, we are pleased that you could come this morning, so we will look forward to hearing from you. Ms. Givhan. Thank you, Mr. Chairman and other committee members. My name is Tahira Yvonne Givhan. I come to you on behalf of the Sickle Cell Disease Association of America. I have sickle anemia. It is a disease of the red blood cells. I am inherited the gene from both my parents. First and foremost, thank you for providing the funding for new treatment therapies, supportive services, and newborn testing. In fact, the doctor tested me while I was still in the hospital, as a newborn baby. That is the law in most states, and it is a fantastic law, because babies with sickle cell anemia often require special care. As a result of your investment, sickle cell anemia no longer spells doom and gloom, the way it did years ago. The mortality rate for infants with sickle cell anemia has decreased dramatically. Again, I thank you. Yes, the advances made in biomedicine in recent years are appreciated greatly. However, more funding is badly needed to help find a cure, so that we will no longer have to manage the pain and suffering that comes with having this unpredictable disease. Because I have sickle cell anemia, my cells are sickled, making it hard for oxygen to stay in them. Sometimes, these sickle shaped cells become sticky and thick, and can clog small blood vessels in my body. When this happens, I hurt. This can cause a lot of pain anywhere in my body. When my head hurts, my parents and doctors have to monitor me closely, to make sure that I do not have a stroke, like many people with sickle cell anemia. It is true that I enjoy a number of activities like other young people my age: ballet, riding my bike, and playing on the swing set. But during most of the days of the week, I am very tired and in pain. At school, I do not think that my teachers understand how difficult it is for me to keep up with the other kids, particularly in P.E. So in addition to being in great pain, I have to suffer the embarrassment of being different. The challenges faced by families that have children with sickle cell anemia are pretty serious. Therefore, the services provided SCDAA's member organization, such as outreach, are very important; but they need more help so that they can help more kids like me. I believe and have faith that a cure will be found in my lifetime, so that as we move into this new millennium, we, too, can enjoy the American dream in its totality. When this happens, it will just be wonderful. Mr. Regula. Well, Tahira, you are a very persuasive witness. [Laughter.] Mr. Jackson. Mr. Jackson. Mr. Chairman, let me again thank Ms. Anderson and Tahira for their testimony. I do not have sickle cell anemia, but I, like my father, carry the trait, as well. I introduced elevating the Office of Research on Minority Health at NIH to a center status last year, which fortunately passed with the help of Mr. Bilirakis, John Lewis, Benny Thompson, Senator Frist and Senator Kennedy in the Senate. Sickle cell anemia just happens to be one of those diseases at the National Institute of Health that could use better coordination amongst all of the centers. But for the elevation of the office to center level, the office itself did not have the ability to even sit in the room with the other centers, to look across the entire institute, for the purposes of trying to arrive at a cure. If there ever was a disease, Mr. Chairman, that is reflective of the disparities that exist amongst those groups who have been left behind in America, it is certainly sickle cell anemia. Of all of the options and diseases that will be before the Center for Research on Minority Health at NIH, sickle cell anemia should be way on top of the list for Dr. Ruffin, Dr. Fouchey, and Ms. Kirschstein at NIH. I will be arguing on behalf of Tahira and other children, as well as Americans who are similarly situated, for the appropriate amounts at the National Institute of Health, to reflect her desire and our desire to bring an end to this devastating illness. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. Mr. Regula. Thank you. Tahira, do you have to miss much school? Ms. Givhan. No. Mr. Regula. You must not, because you certainly speak very well for a fourth grader. Ms. Givhan. Thank you. Mr. Regula. Thank you for coming. Ms. Anderson. Thank you for having us. Mr. Regula. Our next witness is Dr. John Sever, Member, International PolioPlus Committee, Rotary International. Wednesday, March 21, 2001. INTERNATIONAL POLIOPLUS COMMITTEE, ROTARY INTERNATIONAL WITNESS DR. JOHN L. SEVER, MEMBER, INTERNATIONAL POLIOPLUS COMMITTEE, ROTARY INTERNATIONAL Mr. Sever. Thank you very much, Chairman Regula and Congressman Jackson. It is a pleasure and a privilege to be here to tell you about the International PolioPlus Program to eradicate polio worldwide. I am a professor of pediatrics at the Children's Hospital here in Washington and George Washington University. I am representing Rotary International, which I am a member of. There are 1.1 million members of Rotary International, of which there are about 380,000 members in the United States. Some years ago, the Rotary founded a coalition to eradicate polio worldwide. That includes the March of Dimes Birth Defects Foundation, the American Academy of Pediatrics Task Force for Child Survival and Development, and the U.S. Fund for UNICEF, along with Rotary International. We are working to help eradicate this disease worldwide. The goal is to complete that eradication by the year 2005, which is just a few years ahead. It will be only the second disease in the history of man that has been eradicated; small pox being the other disease. So the goal is not just to control the disease, not just to immunize children, but to eradicate the disease completely worldwide by the year 2005, at which point we will be able to stop immunizing for polio, because it will no longer exist in the world, just as we did stop for smallpox. There has been a great deal of progress made, and the support from this subcommittee, your support, has been very important through the U.S. Centers for Disease Control, over the years. That, along with Rotary International's support and other nation's support, has really made a big difference. You have in your material the fact that in 1988, there were over 350,000 cases a year worldwide, and today, just last year, there were only 3,500 cases. So that is down to just one percent of what it was in 1988. Mr. Regula. The United States is fairly clean. Mr. Sever. The United States has had no polio for almost 18 years now. There has been no polio. Eradication has been complete in this hemisphere since 1991. Eradication in the Western Pacific area was achieved two years ago, so this has been focusing down. The only places in the world that polio still exists is in Southeast Asia, India, Pakistan, Bangladesh, and in Africa. So that, right now in the next five years, is the focus to complete the eradication of this disease, so that it will no longer happen. The efforts can be measured in many ways. First, of course, one can estimate the number of children who have not been paralyzed, who would have been paralyzed, if this effort had not taken place, and it now exceeds three million. The effort can be measured in terms of cost savings. In the United States, for example, although as we mentioned, we do not have any cases of polio, we still must immunize all the children in the United States for polio, because it could be brought in from one of these other areas. That costs us, in this country, about $230 million a year to immunize for a disease that we do not have. That would be, of course, saved, once the disease is eradicated. Worldwide immunization costs about $1.5 billion a year for polio. Again, on a worldwide level, that would be a tremendous savings. So both in terms of the reduction, the suffering, and the cost, just to mention two areas, there is a tremendous benefit for completing this job in the next few years. The U.S. Center for Disease Control has been a great assistance. This last year, the appropriation was for $91.4 million. When you go to Atlanta, and besides seeing the buildings, I hope that you will learn more about how they are providing epidemiologists worldwide to help participate in this eradication effort. There is a large new group in India and another group in Africa, which are vital to identifying where polio is continuing, and where it has to be immunized in carrying national immunization days; plus, providing vaccines. The Rotary is also doing this. Rotary, since 1988, has been providing money for vaccine immunizations, as well as volunteers. By the time this job is done, Rotary will have provided about $500 million towards this eradication program, from its own contributions and its own funds. We are asking this year that the appropriation be increased by $15 million, for a total of $106.4 million. The reason for that is, that the price of the vaccine has gone up from about seven cents a dose, to about 9.6 cents a dose, and because of the tremendous amount of effort that is required now in Africa specifically to get the job done. Thank you. [The information follows:] [GRAPHIC(S) NOT AVAILABLE IN TIFF FORMAT] Mr. Regula. Well, thank you very much. I think it is great that a service organization such as Rotary does get behind what is obviously a very worthwhile project. Mr. Sever. Thank you. Mr. Jackson. Mr. Chairman, I just have one question. Mr. Regula. Yes, Mr. Jackson? Mr. Jackson. Let me also congratulate you, sir, for the work that you have undertaken. To what do we owe the substantial cost increase for the cost of the polio vaccine? Mr. Sever. Well, basically, the costs of materials have gone up in the last couple of years, and the large volumes that are now being used have caused the manufacturers to have to build additional facilities, as I understand, in order to produce this. For example, in India, we had an immunization date, which is the way you would eradicate this, as we are doing in Africa. There are 17 countries in Africa, simultaneously immunizing their entire population of children under five years of age. It takes enormous amounts of vaccine, and we have had to just tremendously increase the capacities to provide this vaccine, and to have it available. In India, for example, a few weeks ago, they just immunized 140 million children in one day. There is just an unbelievable effort to that, and it is an enormous quantity of vaccine. So unfortunately, the cost of producing the vaccine and the cost of augmenting the facilities has come back in terms of this increase in vaccine costs. Mr. Jackson. Is the cost that you have requested, in terms of the increase in the program, does it approximate the size of the problem, in terms of our ability to curtail the disease by administering polio vaccines, but at the same time, does it take into account the fact that the population in many of these areas is constantly growing and expanding? Mr. Sever. It takes into consideration both, sir. The population growth is important. The issues of administration under these massive programs has to be taken into consideration. The other countries are assisting, too. The United States, I think, is the leadership of countries, but Great Britain and most European countries are also helping to try to get this job done. The fact that we are focusing on it to get it done quickly in the next five years is important, too, because we can then complete the job, and it will not have to go on and on and on. Mr. Jackson. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. Mr. Regula. Thank you. Our next witness is Lydia Lewis, who will be introduced by Mr. Jackson. Mr. Jackson. Mr. Chairman, Lydia Lewis became Executive Director of the National Depressive and Manic-Depressive Association in 1997. Headquartered in my hometown of Chicago, the National DMDA is the largest patient-directed, illness-specific organization in the country, with nearly 400 patient-run support groups throughout the country. Ms. Lewis' primary responsibility has been to position national DMDA as a leading source for information on mood disorders, and the treatments for patients, family members, health care professionals, the media, and others. She holds a bachelor's degree in psychology from the State University of New York at Buffalo. She was a charter member of the NIH Director's Counsel of Public Representatives. She also serves on the oversight committees of several large NINH clinical trials, including current trials studying the effectiveness of treatments for bi-polar disorder and the study of treatment of adolescents with depression. One of her proudest accomplishments has been her willingness to confront her own life-long battle with depression. Mr. Chairman and members of the committee, I present Ms. Lewis. ---------- Wednesday, March 21, 2001. NATIONAL DEPRESSIVE AND MANIC-DEPRESSIVE ASSOCIATION WITNESS LYDIA LEWIS, EXECUTIVE DIRECTOR, NATIONAL DEPRESSIVE AND MANIC- DEPRESSIVE ASSOCIATION Ms. Lewis. Thank you very much, Congressman Jackson; I truly appreciate the introduction. Mr. Chairman Regula and members of the subcommittee, as Congressman Jackson said, I am Lydia Lewis. I am the Executive Director of the National Depressive and Manic-Depressive Association. We appreciate the opportunity to testify in support of funding for neuro-science, behavioral science, and genetic research, through the National Institutes of Health and the National Institute of Mental Health. National DMDA applauds the doubling of the NIH budget, and encourages the subcommittee to continue providing strong leadership on this effort, which has had a significant impact on mental health research. While I am here today to testify on behalf of National DMDA, I know personally what it is like to battle depression every day, to fight the urge to end my life. It is a dreadful way to live. I, myself, suffer from the disease, and I am not alone. The recent global burden of disease study conducted by the World Health Organization, the World Bank, and Harvard University found that mental illness has long been misunderstood. In fact, it accounts for more than 15 percent of the burden of disease in established market economies. This is more than the disease burden caused by all cancers combined. More than 20 million American adults suffer from unipolar or major depression every year, and it is the leading cause of disability in the world today. An additional 2.3 million people suffer from bipolar disorder. Onset is nearly always before the age of 20, meaning more high school drop-outs, more illegal drug and alcohol use, higher teen pregnancy rates, more teen violence, and more adolescent suicides. An estimated 50 million Americans experience a mental disorder in any given year, yet only one-fourth of them actually receive mental health and other services. Women are more than twice as likely as men to experience depression. One out of every four American women will experience a major depressive episode in her lifetime. Coping with these devastating illnesses is a tragic, exhausting, and difficult way to live. Mood disorders and other mental illnesses kill people every day. Depression is the leading cause of suicide. One in every five bipolar sufferers takes his or her life; one in five. Suicide is the third leading cause of death among fifteen to twenty-four year old Americans. For every two homicides committed in the United States, there are three suicides. Despite these facts, stigmatizing mental illness is a common occurrence. Labeling people with mental illnesscontinues to send the message that de-valuing mental illness is acceptable. Equally devastating is the stigma associated with the research of mental illnesses. Research in behavioral science is as critical as that undertaken for any other illness. Our understanding of the brain is extremely limited, and will remain so for decades, unless much greater financial support is provided. Neuro-science research is also critically important to understand the mechanisms in the brain that lead to these illnesses. Every day, technology and science bring us further in understanding the brain. These kinds of successes build upon each other. Great strides are being made, but it is imperative that the progress be maintained. In 1999, the Surgeon General released the first-ever study from that office on mental illness. It concluded that these diseases are real, treatable, and affect the most vital organ in the body, the brain. We are particularly pleased that NIMH played a lead role in the Surgeon General's report on youth violence. With further research into the relationship between mental illness and violence, we are hopeful that tragedies like the recent school shootings in California and across the country can be prevented in the future. Research supported by NIMH has led to a much better understanding of these illnesses. We are learning more about their impact on other diseases, such as Parkinson's, cardio-vascular ailments, stroke, diabetes, and obesity. But more funding for NIMH and other research institutions is critical to ensure that any forward momentum is not lost. We commend the subcommittee's past support of the National Institutes of Health and the National Institute of Mental Health, and your renewed commitment to full funding of mental health research. Together, our efforts will mean real treatment options, and an end to the stigma associated with mental illness, lives saved, and a far more productive America. Again, I appreciate the opportunity to testify. [The information follows:] [GRAPHIC(S) NOT AVAILABLE IN TIFF FORMAT] Mr. Regula. Thank you. Mr. Jackson, do you have any questions? Mr. Jackson. I do not have any questions, Mr. Chairman. Mr. Regula. Thank you for coming. Ms. Lewis. Thank you. Mr. Regula. Our next witness will be Dr. George Hardy, Executive Director of the Association of State and Territorial Health Officials. Mr. Hardy, welcome. ---------- Wednesday, March 21, 2001. ASSOCIATION OF STATE AND TERRITORIAL HEALTH OFFICIALS WITNESS GEORGE E. HARDY, JR., MD, MPH, EXECUTIVE DIRECTOR, ASSOCIATION OF STATE AND TERRITORIAL HEALTH OFFICIALS Mr. Hardy. Thank you, Mr. Chairman, Mr. Jackson, and members of the subcommittee. I appreciate the opportunity to appear here this morning. My name is George Hardy. I have the privilege of serving as the Executive Director of ASTHO, the Association of State and Territorial Health Officials. In the last century, our nation has made tremendous strides in improving the health of Americans. As Dr. Sever just reminded you, we have eradicated smallpox from the globe, polio from the Americas, and we have had substantial reduction in the incidents of disease and death from major infectious and chronic diseases. We also recognize that there is a lot more that we have to do. I would like to make the case that as a nation, we need to continue our investment and research, but just as importantly, we need to invest in the transfer of research findings to public health programs. If research findings are not made available to the public, they might just as well not have been made. If society is going to be the ultimate beneficiary of our commitment to research, we need to make the same kind of commitment to investment in programming. CDC and HRSA provide the states with the resources to carry out these public health programs. ASTHO urges the committee to assure that CDC receives a total appropriation in fiscal year 2002 of $5 billion and HRSA, $6.7 billion This morning, I will discuss only a few of the important programs to states. You have heard about immunization, but you are going to hear about it again. Let me tell you how important this is. In the last 50 years, immunization programs have produced a 95 percent decline in most childhood vaccine-preventable diseases. Despite this, an estimated one million American two- year-olds have not received one or more doses of vaccine that they should have had, at that point in life. Not only must we assure that the children are adequately immunized, but we also need to assure that adolescents and adults receive needed immunization services, such as influenza, hepatitis, and pneumococcal vaccine. We thank the members of this subcommittee for ensuring that CDC received a down-payment last year on much-needed immunization funding. But as the Institute of Medicine has pointed out, additional funds are still necessary to meet the need. Just one example of such a need is the important challenge of raising immunization levels among children served by WIC programs. Specifically, we are requested $32.5 million additional dollars for CDC's immunization infrastructure program, and $93 million additional for domestic vaccine purchases. This latter figure, I know, sounds high; but it is necessary if we are going to provide the newly-approved pneumococcal vaccine for children. This vaccine will cost health departments nearly $200 per child to purchase. The preventive health and health services block grant is a component of every state's strategy to address their own unique health needs. ASTHO has just produced this new publication, ``Making a Difference,'' which I know you have seen, Mr. Chairman, and it documents the impact of public health through this program. Every state does something different. In Ohio, for instance, to just pick a state at random, the Health Department has shown a marked reduction in the incidents of adverse reactions and preventable hospital admissions, as a result of medication errors in the elderly. As I have said, every state has addressed its own problems. I think that this document will convince you of the importance of the preventative block. Since its inception 20 years ago, funding for the preventive block grant has been stagnant. It has not kept pace with inflation. It has not been adjusted for the increasing population, or for the new public health needs that were not even known at the time it was created, such as AIDS and West Nile Virus. We are asking the subcommittee to provide an additional $75 million for that block grant. Last year, the Congress enacted the Public Health Threats and Emergencies Act, to address bioterrorism, antimicrobial resistance, and public health capacity. Each of these are critically important, and we would urge the subcommittee to fully fund the $534 million that is authorized for these services. Many other programs at CDC and HRSA deserve this committee's attention. The Maternal and Child Health Block Grant and the Ryan White Care Act, both programs at HRSA, are critical to the states, and we support the request of $850 million for the MCH block grant. I want to close by expressing again our appreciation to this subcommittee for its past commitment to public health. Your work has made a tremendous difference in the lives of people, and we are going to need your help again this year, as we try to advance the health of our Nation. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. [The information follows:] [GRAPHIC(S) NOT AVAILABLE IN TIFF FORMAT] Mr. Regula. Well, thank you very much for your comments. I am sure there is a great need there. The next witness is Dr. Thomas Clemens, Professor of Medicine and Molecular and Cell Physiology, University of Cincinnati. ---------- Wednesday, March 21, 2001. NATIONAL COALITION FOR OSTEOPOROSIS AND RELATED BONE DISEASES WITNESS DR. THOMAS L. CLEMENS, PROFESSOR OF MEDICINE AND MOLECULAR AND CELL PHYSIOLOGY, UNIVERSITY OF CINCINNATI COLLEGE OF MEDICINE, NATIONAL COALITION FOR OSTEOPOROSIS AND RELATED BONE DISEASES Dr. Clemens. Thanks, Mr. Chairman and Congressman Jackson. My name is Tom Clemens. I work at the University of Cincinnati. I do basic research in bone biology. With me is Charles Hall, a patient with fibrous dysplasia. The National Coalition for Osteoporosis and Related Bone Diseases appreciates this opportunity to present our position on the need for continued and expanded funding for osteoporosis and related bond disease research at the National Institutes of Health. We also appreciate the committee's past support for the goal of doubling the NIH budget, and last year's significant increase. The bone diseases represented by our coalition occur in all populations and at all ages. They are devastating diseases, with significant physical, psycho-social, and financial consequences, including pain, disability, and death. Consider, if you will, what we already know about how our bones function. Throughout life, our bone is constantly being remodeled through repeated cycles of bone breakdown and bone build-up. As we age, this balance shifts in favor of bone breakdown, rather than bone build-up. If unchecked, this delicate balancing act goes awry, and this results in bone disease. Our increasing understanding of this process has led to exciting new drug therapies, that balance out. Yet, bone disease still has no cure, and there are many important questions remaining unanswered. What are the major bone diseases? One is osteoporosis, the most prevalent bone disease in this country. It is characterized by low bone mass and structural deterioration of bone. Ten million Americans have osteoporosis, and 18 million more have low bone mass, placing them at risk of the disease. In 1995, osteoporosis was responsible for 2.5 million physician visits; 180,000 nursing home omissions, and over 400,000 hospital admissions. The direct cost of fracture is $13.8 billion, which should triple by the year 2040. Paget's disease of bone is a chronic disorder that may result in enlarged or deformed bones in one or more regions of the skeleton. Complications may include arthritis, fractures, bowing of the limbs, and hearing loss. Paget's affects up to eight percent of our population over 60. That is two to three million Americans. Osteogenesis Imperfecta is a genetic disorder that is typically diagnosed in infancy. Osteogenesis imperfecta causes bones to break easily. For example, a cough or a sneeze can break a rib; simply rolling over in bed can break a leg. Osteogenesis Imperfecta affects an estimated 30,000 adults, children and infants in the United States, causing as many as several hundred broken bones in a lifetime. I understand from Mr. Grove, Chairman Regula, that you have actually had the opportunity to see a number of these patients at the Institute of Child Health. Fibrous dysplasia, which affects Mr. Hall, is a chronic disease of the skeleton, which causes expansion of one or more bones, due to the development of a fibrous scar within the bone. This weakens the bone, causing pain, deformity, disability, and fracture. At present, there are no approved therapies for this disease. Osteopetrosis is a disease present at birth, at which bones are overly dense. This is due, again, to an imbalance between bone formation and bone breakdown. Complications often begin before the age of five, and include fractures, frequent infections, and problems with sight and blood vessel disease. The National Institute of Arthritis and Muscular Skeletal and Skin Diseases, NIAMS, leads the Federal research effort on bone disease; however, the need for trans-NIH search is vital. Bone- related disease cuts across many research institutes at the NIH. Given the breadth and depth of these diseases, we urge the committee to instruct NIH to make this one of its top trans-NIH priorities. With the steady greying of Americans, now is the time to find solutions to these dehabilitating diseases, in order to alleviate the stress that will be placed on the Medicare system in the future. Vast opportunities still exit to expand our current knowledge base. Initiatives that may serve as springboards to further research include: basic research, funded by the NIH; and clinical trials with power-thyroid hormone, or PTH, the newest front-line treatment for osteoporosis. One form of PTH has just been submitted to the FDA for approval. Researchers still do not really know how it functions at the cellular level. While osteoporosis was once thought to be a woman's disease, it is now an important issue among men. An estimated one-third of hip fractures, worldwide, occur in men, including the one recently sustained by President Ronald Reagan. A major study on how the disease affects men is currently underway and supported by the NIH. In the area of osteogenesis imperfecta, researchers are exploring the effectiveness of a drug that appears to increase bone marrow density and decrease bone loss. Finally, a new clinical center for patients with fibrous dysplasia was recently established at the NIH, and has proved to be a resource for physicians and patients around the country, while furthering research on this crippling disease. Mr. Chairman, the research community sincerely appreciates the committee's efforts over the years to ensure continued strength of the NIH research program. The high value that we continue to place on biomedical research will lead to the prevention of disease, reduce disability, and decrease the staggering health care costs associated with bone and other diseases. Just let me say one more thing before I finish, and that concerns the timing of our request. With the completion of the human genome project, researchers right now are poised to make new discoveries and identify new gene targets. This is going to be absolutely essential, so the timing of our request is critical. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. [The information follows:] [GRAPHIC(S) NOT AVAILABLE IN TIFF FORMAT] Mr. Regula. Do you deal with brittle bones? Mr. Clemens. Yes, and the one disease that I did mention, osteopetrosis, is called marble bone disease. Osteogenesis imperfecta is also associated with brittle bones, and is called actually Brittle Bone Disease. Mr. Regula. That is a very difficult challenge. Are there any questions, Mr. Jackson? Mr. Jackson. Mr. Chairman, just by virtue of the fact that NIAMS is an institute at NIH, and they are already engaged in trans-NIH research on many of the diseases that you indicated, is there a specific funding request for any of the diseases that you mentioned, that should be covered, above and beyond what the committee and the President have already made a commitment to do? I am not so sure that I actually heard that in your testimony. Mr. Clemens. We would recommend a 16.5 percent increase for NIAMS; but I wanted to stress the trans-NIH funding; because there are institutes, for example, child health and the cancer institutes, where these bone diseases are also funded. So we would like to recommend the 6.5 increase, with the trans-NIH funding for that. That is not over and above 16.5 percent. Mr. Regula. Thank you very much. Our next witness is Lawrence Pizzi, Volunteer, North American Brain Tumor Coalition. ---------- Wednesday, March 21, 2001 NORTH AMERICAN BRAIN TUMOR COALITION WITNESS LAWRENCE PIZZI, VOLUNTEER, NORTH AMERICAN BRAIN TUMOR COALITION Mr. Pizzi. Good afternoon, Mr. Chairman. I am going to follow suit with many of my predecessors, and tell you that although I was born overseas, my first and earliest memories are Kent, Ohio. [Laughter.] Mr. Regula. You are getting close. Mr. Pizzi. I knew I had to come up with something. Mr. Regula. Well, Chicago and Ohio have done well today. Mr. Pizzi. My name is Larry Pizzi. It is my privilege to appear today as a representative of the North American Brain Tumor Coalition, a network of 12 charitable organizations that raise funds for brain tumor research, and provide information and support to individuals with brain tumors, their families, and their friends. We corroborate in advocacy to increase brain tumor research. We also work to guarantee that every brain tumor patient has access to the best possible health care. I am also the Executive Director of one of the coalition's founding member organizations, and the only member of the coalition not represented by one of the states on this committee. I am from Massachusetts. Most importantly, though, I am the father of Timothy Lawrence Pizzi, a child diagnosed with a brain tumor in 1989. He lived nearly seven years, before dying at the age of 12. Mr. Regula. This was your son? Mr. Pizzi. Yes, my son. Mr. Regula. He was born with the tumor? Mr. Pizzi. He was diagnosed at age six with a tumor that he probably had since birth. He died at age 12. He and thousands like him, children and adults, are the reason that my testimony today is a privilege, and I thank you. Brain tumors are a unique disease and present special challenges for all that they touch. Brain tumors are not a single disease. Instead, there are at least 126 types of central nervous system tumors. It is difficult to treat brain tumors, not only because of their diversity, but because of the unique biology of the brain. I am sure that you can understand how it is possible to remove a lung, a breast, or prostate that is affected by cancer; but we cannot remove the brain. Treatment strategies that are successful with other cancers cannot be used to treat brain tumors. Moreover, brain tumors affect the organ that make us who we are. They are a disease not only of the body, but also of the soul. They are a disease of the quality of life. A recent Government study accurately defined a brain tumor's impact as mental impairment, seizures, and paralysis that affect the very core of a person, and have a demoralizing effect on loved ones. Added to these burdens is the knowledge that for most brain tumors, adequate treatment is not available. In children, even if they do survive the devastating impact of the treatment, it often leaves them with permanent damage. However, these are exciting times, and there is hope for progress. I would simply echo those who have come before me, and ask that we continue to fund the National Institutes of Health in such a way that we essentially double the research budget by the year 2003. We join the other patient organizations in commending this committee for its role in that progress, and we would ask that you continue it. Brain tumor research suffers from a lack of trained clinical investigators. Good funding is going to be very important to continue attract them. Mr. Regula. Is there any one institution that is focusing on this, that you are aware of? Mr. Pizzi. That is my next point. We have been urging for a number of years corroboration between the two institutes at the National Institutes of Health, that have responsibility for brain tumors, the NINDS and NCI. That is the National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke and the National Cancer Institute. I am very glad to say that over the last year, we have seen much progress in that area, resulting in this document by a progress review group, that was carried out jointly bythe NINDS and the NCI, and advocates in the extra-mural community. I am here today to ask you and your committee to ensure that this progress review group document, which represents a true corroboration between Government, the private sector, and the advocacy sector, not become a document on a shelf. These organizations, the NCI and the NINDS, have worked very well together to produce a national strategy for attacking this disease. We have a couple of specific requests. One is that we enhance brain tumor research through continuing the corroboration that this document represents. The two institutes should strengthen their mechanisms for coordination and corroboration among extra-mural researchers. The written version of my testimony contains the details of how we would like this accomplished. They should organize and fund a series of inter- disciplinary meetings, of researchers that would focus on the subjects of brain tumor biology. They, along with the Center for Scientific Review, should make sure that study sections, or the people who look at the grant requests coming up from the field, saying yes, we should fund this or no, we should not, have the right expertise to evaluate brain tumor grants. Currently, they do not. Mr. Regula. You do not think they are capable of making judgments on the allocation of the resource money? Mr. Pizzi. Brain tumors are highly specialized. Our experience is that the specialists who make up the brain tumor community are not adequately represented on those. I will close with this point. In addition, there is the recently established NCI-NINDS Neuro-oncology Branch. They see this as great progress, because it represents the two institutions. We would like to see that branch continue, to not only work intermurally in Bethesda, but to be sort of the focal point for the corroboration. I would like to tell you that my son was very close to a very prominent brain tumor researcher. His name was Dr. Mark Israel. One day shortly before my son died, knowing that he would die, he called Mark on the telephone, and asked him the question that he would always love to ask him, ``Mark, are still looking for a cure?'' Mark, of course, told him that he was. Timothy said to him, ``Now would be a good time.'' It did not work for Tim, or thousands of others, since he died five years ago. He became part of one statistic that I will leave you with. Brain tumors are the leading cause of cancer deaths in children under the age of 20, now surpassing acute lymphoblastic leukemia, and are the third leading cause of cancer deaths in young adults, ages 20 to 39. We applaud the dedication of this subcommittee to advancing biomedical research. We look forward to working with you to support brain tumor research at a time when advances, we believe, are truly going to be possible, and to make a time when the Timothys of this world will have a much brighter future. I thank you. [The information follows:] [GRAPHIC(S) NOT AVAILABLE IN TIFF FORMAT] Mr. Regula. Thank you. What are the choices, since you cannot use chemicals or chemotherapy? Mr. Pizzi. Brain tumors are resistent, generally, to chemotherapy, because of the nature of the biology of the brain. Radiation is a very common treatment; but, of course, it does a lot of damage to normal, healthy brain tissue. So we have a case where the treatment can leave the patient cured or in remission, but with so many deficits. Nearly 80 percent of adults who have brain tumors or are treated for them are unable to go back to work, even though they are still alive. Children who are treated for brain tumors live the rest of their lives with cognitive deficits. So it is just the nature of where it is, Mr. Chairman. It is truly a unique organ of the body. There are 126 kinds of them. There is no other cancer that has that many sub-sets of a disease. Mr. Regula. It puts pressure on the brain. Mr. Pizzi. Automatically, and that, of course, is a major problem. Mr. Regula. I had a friend that died that way. Thank you very much. Mr. Pizzi. Thank you very much for your time. Our next witness is Ken Moss, Friends of Cancer Research. Mr. Moss? ---------- Wednesday, March 21, 2001 FRIENDS OF CANCER RESEARCH WITNESS DR. KEN MOSS, FRIENDS OF CANCER RESEARCH Ms. Segal. Good afternoon, Mr. Chairman, I am Ellen Segal of Friends of Cancer Research. I am pleased to introduce to you Dr. Ken Moss. He is from your home state of Ohio, from Cleveland. He is an endothesiologist, and he also teaches at Case Western. Dr. Moss and his wife Anita are going to put a human face on this disease, and talk about their daughter Elisa. You will hear from Dr. Moss. Dr. Moss. Dr. Moss. Thank you. Chairman Regula and members of the subcommittee, thank you for the opportunity to testify today. I come before you not as a physician, but as a father of a beautiful and talented 17 year old, who passed away last October from cancer. I took this photo on Elisa's high school graduation, almost four months before she died. She looked exactly the same way on that fateful day in October. In fact, hours before she died, she stopped in front of the mirror on the way out the door to the doctor's office, telling her mother that she was going to put on makeup, so that no one would be able to tell that, ``I am a cancer patient.'' Elisa was gifted and mature beyond her years. Almost everyone she met liked her. Over 900 people attended her funeral. Classmates flew home from college from as far away as California, because Elisa meant that much to them. It is impossible in five minutes to tell you of all the anguish, fear and frustration that we felt as we watched helplessly as cancer slowly took her. While returning from a New Year's cruise in January of 1998, my daughter noticed pain in her thigh. I did not think anything of it; however, the pain persisted. Within a few weeks, my wife arranged for a MRI. A mass was found and quickly biopsied. ``I am sorry, but your daughter has cancer.'' No statement will strike more terror into a parent than that. Even worse, Elisa had a rare, highly malignant tumor. The prognosis was a 20 percent five year survival. As a parent, I was devastated; but as a doctor, I simply could not accept it. We took her to Memorial Sloan Kettering for a second opinion. They recommended high dose chemotherapy, surgical excision, and a bone marrow transplant. Throughout the chemotherapy that caused extreme illness, loss of her hair, and most importantly, forced her to remain at home and stop going to school, Elisa fought back. She never gave up and she never complained. During each of the 12 surgical procedures that she had in the two years that followed her diagnosis, she always remained optimistic, and she was an inspiration to everyone who knew her. In August, 1998, Elisa underwent a stem cell transplant. Yet, six months later, she relapsed, with a tumor in her lung. After a biopsy confirmed the worst, a big debate ensured about what to do. Traditional medicine had failed her, so we examined experimental protocols at the National Cancer Institute. One study in particular had promise, and Elisa, who had always played an active role in her treatment, agreed. This began a period of four months of commuting to Bethesda with Elisa. But the home run that we had hoped run was not to be, and by August 1, 1999, it was clear to investigators that Elisa was not responding and, in fact, her tumors were doubling, both in size and in number, each month. I brought Elisa back home to the Cleveland Clinic, and her doctor sat me down and told me that she had less than three months to live, and that her only chance was more chemotherapy, to hopefully shrink the tumors and buy her more time. To me, this was insanity, doing the same thing again, and expecting a different result. I knew that her only hope was to target the cancer cells by other means, such as attacking the tumors' blood supply. My family and I had already read all the literature. We were knowledgeable about the tremendous advances that were being made with different agents. There were so many promising treatments on the horizon; if only we had the time to wait for the studies to be carried out; time for new drugs to come to market. But we did not, and Elisa had only three months to live. Elisa's doctors at the Cleveland Clinic accepted my suggestion that we try a radically different approach that was only vaguely described in one person and in animal studies. The treatment which we modified constantly over the next 13 months significantly slowed her tumor growth. Not only did Elisa not die, she went with us on a 10 day Christmas cruise, and had a ball. In March, Elisa returned to high school and completed her senior year. She went to prom and lived as normally as she could, despite the fact that twice a week, in our family room, I would hook her up to an IV, and administer the experimental treatment. She graduated with highest honors, and was accepted to Case Western Reserve University, where she intended to get a combined degree in nutrition and biochemistry. Sadly, her time ran out before the treatment protocol that we were using could be fine-tuned. Elisa was content to live with her cancer. She was hopeful that we could convert it to a chronic disease. Elisa's dream can become a reality if Congress and the White House live up to the five year commitment to double the NIH budget. If the Government falters on the commitment, at a time of great excitement and optimism amongst cancer researchers, the momentum will be lost. It is also essential to fund NCI's bypass budget request, which is a comprehensive national plan for cancer research. There is hope in the near future for effective treatment alternatives, and promising laboratory research awaits clinical studies, such as those underway at the NCI. No single treatment will effectively control cancer. Combinations of different treatments will be necessary. Costly clinical studies of treatment combinations must be started. Elisa did not die because she had incurable cancer. My daughter died because we did not know how to control it. A week before she died, she said her goodbyes. She made one request to each member of her family. She requested that my son, Jordan, name his first-born child after her. She requested that my wife, Anita, visit her grave every day, for the first year. To me, she asked that I ensure that her death would not be in vain; that something positive would result from it. It is for this reason that I come before you today. Please do not allow Elisa's legacy to die. Thank you. [The information follows:] [GRAPHIC(S) NOT AVAILABLE IN TIFF FORMAT] Mr. Regula. We will try. Thank you for coming. Our next witness will be Michaelle Wormley, Executive Director of Women Opting for More Affordable Housing Now, Inc. ---------- Wednesday, March 21, 2001. WOMEN OPTING FOR MORE AFFORDABLE HOUSING NOW, INC. WITNESSES MICHAELLE WORMLEY, EXECUTIVE DIRECTOR OF WOMEN OPTING FOR MORE AFFORDABLE HOUSING NOW, INC. JOANNE KANE, EXECUTIVE DIRECTOR OF THE MCAULEY INSTITUTE Ms. Wormley. Good afternoon, Mr. Chairman and members of the subcommittee. You have my written statement. I will just provide you with some of the highlights. I am Michaelle Wormley, the Executive Director of Women Opting for More Affordable Housing Now, WOMAN, Incorporated. We are a Southeast Texas non-profit organization, that creates affordable, livable transitional housing, and supportive services for women living in abusive relationships. We are asking for at least $25 million for fiscal year 2002, for a housing assistance program authorized under the Violence Against Women Act last year. WOMAN, Inc. grew out of a networking group of nine battered women's shelters and service providers in a 13 county area, including Houston, Dallas, and Beaumont, Texas. Our long-term goal, since we were founded in 1993, has been developing transitional housing facilities at each of the nine locations represented in the consortium. Each sponsor provides comprehensive social services and property management, while WOMAN, Inc. may finance, own, maintain, operate and sell the properties it develops in order to provide the most cost-effective project that is affordable to woman earning 50 percent or less of the medium income. I am accompanied today by JoAnne Kane, Executive Director of the McAuley Institute. McAuley was founded by the Sisters of Mercy in 1983, and is the only national faith-based housing organization that focuses its resources on low income women and families. McAuley has worked closely with WOMAN, Inc. since 1993, providing both technical assistance and financial services. Many of the women who participate in housing programs and related services provided by the community-based groups like WOMAN, Inc. are survivors of domestic violence. As housing providers, the dilemma that we saw was that families, having begun to stabilize their lives in a shelter program had only one choice when seeking affordable housing; that of returning to their batterers. Our vision was to provide survivors more viable options for restoring their lives. That vision was honored by the Fannie Mae Foundation with the maximum Awards of Excellence in May of 1999, and recognition of our Destiny Village Project in Pasadena, Texas. Destiny Village is a 30 unit apartment complex, which provides supported housing to families leaving domestic violence. Over the past several years, McAuley, along with a coalition of 200 groups representing domestic violence and sexual assault survivors have strived to re-authorize the Violence Against Women Act with the Housing Assistance Program. With the October, 2000 Enactment of VAWA 2000, our goal was partially realized. VAWA housing assistance would provide a bridge, up to eighteen months, to help survivors secure a stable, secure environment for themselves and their children. The new law requires that the housing assistance must be needed to prevent homelessness, and may be used for rent, utilities, security deposits, or other costs of relocation. Support services to enable survivors to obtain permanent housing, and to aid their integration into a community, including transportation, counseling, child care services, case management, and employment counseling could be supported with grant funds. VAWA enjoyed strong bipartisan support, and the Congress clearly intended to create and fund a viable housing assistance program under VAWA. We fully expect the program to be extended this year as part of the Child Abuse Prevention and Treatment Act, for which the current authorization is five years, and expires this year. The need for this program is critical. According to the U.S. Conference of Mayors 1999 survey of 26 cities, domestic violence was listed as the fifth leading cause of homelessness. The Texas Department of Human Services figures indicate that for the fiscal ending 1998, 3,796 adults were denied shelter, due to lack of space. A conservative estimate from HUD's homeless office is that nine percent of all clients serviced came directly from a domestic violence situation. An informal poll of domestic service providers nationwide, conducted over the last two months about a national coalition against domestic violence, the number one funding need identified by shelter based programs was for transitional housing for battered women. The importance of housing assistance to families fleeing abusive situations cannot be overstated. Short-term housing aid and targeted supportive services can help survivors bridge the gap between financial and emotional dependency, and productive, healthy, and life-sustaining environments for themselves and their children. We ask that you provide $25 million for VAWA housing assistance for the coming year. JoAnne, did you want to speak? Ms. Kane. The experience of WOMAN, Inc. is duplicated across the country, both as a direct response to the woman fleeing violence, and an example of successful programs, created by local women leaders to deal with some of our nation's most intractable problems. These women leaders project a solely pathological assessment, which looks at violence alone as the problem. They craft multi-faceted programs that combine human development and community development, family health andcommunity building strategies. The care-givers are often finding themselves in the same situation as the women, knowing that housing is the one solution, and yet finding that the opportunities for women decline daily. There are 5.4 million worse case housing needs in this country, and 60 percent are women. So the appropriation is needed, a system and a practical system is ready to respond, and their are women for whom the opportunity is not just a home of their own, but an opportunity to leave family violence behind forever. Thank you. [The information follows:] [GRAPHIC(S) NOT AVAILABLE IN TIFF FORMAT] Mr. Regula. Thank you. Do the habitat programs help? Ms. Wormley. They are a critical response to the need. However, again, in trying to assure stability for the mothers and the children, transitional housing is very critical. Mr. Regula. Thank you very much. Our next witness is Jerold Goldberg, Dean, Case Western Reserve, School of Dentistry. Welcome to the panel. ---------- Wednesday, March 21, 2001. HEALTH PROFESSIONS AND NURSING EDUCATION COALITION [HPNEC] WITNESS JEROLD GOLDBERG, D.M.D., DEAN, CASE WESTERN RESERVE UNIVERSITY SCHOOL OF DENTISTRY, TESTIFYING ON BEHALF OF THE HEALTH PROFESSIONS AND NURSING EDUCATION COALITION [HPNEC] Mr. Goldberg. Mr. Chairman, I am Jerry Goldberg, Dean of the Case Western Reserve University School of Dentistry. I am testifying today on behalf of the Health Professions and Nursing Education Coalition [HPNEC]. This is an informal alliance of over 40 organizations, dedicated to ensure that Title 7 and 8 programs continue to help educate the Nation's health care personnel. These programs improve the accessibility, quality, and racial and ethnic diversity of the health care work force. In addition to providing unique and essential training and education opportunities, these programs help meet the health care delivery needs of under-served areas in this country. At times, they serve as the only source of health care in many rural and disadvantaged communities. Additionally, the graduates of Bureau of Health Profession- funded programs are three to ten times more likely than average graduates to participate in medically under-served communities. These programs graduate two to five times more minority and disadvantaged students. As the Nation's health care delivery system rapidly changes and makes dramatic changes, the Bureau of Health Professions has identified the following five priorities, to ensure that all providers are prepared to meet the challenges of the health care in the 21st Century. They are: geriatrics, genetics, diversity, and informatics. HPNEC has determined that these programs require $550 million to educate and train the health care work force that addresses these priorities. As part of the two year effort to reach this goal, HPNEC recommends at least $440 million dollars for Title 7 and 8 in fiscal year 2002. These figures do not include funding for the Childrens Hospital's Graduate Medical Education Program, and are now separate from Title 7 and 8 funding. The programs are organized in the following categories: minority and disadvantaged health professions; primary care medicine and dentistry; interdisciplinary, community-based linkages; health professions work force information and analysis; public health work force development; Nurse Education Act; and student financial assistance. A serious defect in our health care system is the lack of dental care for low income populations and those in under- served areas. With funding from Title 7, institutions are able to provide oral health to these under-served populations. Dentists who have benefitted from advanced training in general dentistry and pediatric dentistry consistently refer fewer patients to specialists, which is especially important in rural and under-served urban areas, where logistics and financial barriers can make specialized care unobtainable. The Bureau of Health Professions in HRSA provides threeyear grants to start expanded programs and to expand programs, after which time, these programs must be self-sufficient. Eighty-seven percent of the dentists who go through these programs remain in primary care practice. Members of HPNEC are concerned that the Administration has severely cut or even eliminated portions of Title 7 and 8 funding. It states in the health profession section of the budget blueprint that ``Today a physician shortage no longer exists. Moreover, the Federal role is questionable in this area, given that these professions are well paid, and that market forces are much more likely to influence and determine supply.'' We contend that typical market forces do not eliminate work force shortages in under-served areas, and that their effect on skyrocketing costs of living has directly contributed to the kind of health care professionals in these regions. HPNEC has provided a letter to the President, outlining this position. We appreciate the subcommittee's support in the past. We look to you again to support these programs and their essential role in the health care system. Thank you for accepting this testimony. [The information follows:] [GRAPHIC(S) NOT AVAILABLE IN TIFF FORMAT] Mr. Regula. Thank you for bringing this to our attention. Our next witness is Dr. Frankie Roman, Medical Director, Center for Sleep Disorders, at Doctors Hospital in Massillon, Ohio. We are happy to welcome you, my next door neighbor, almost. Dr. Roman. For a second, Mr. Chairman, I thought you were avoiding your neighbor. [Laughter.] ---------- Wednesday, March 21, 2001. NATIONAL SLEEP FOUNDATION WITNESS FRANKIE ROMAN, M.D., MEDICAL DIRECTOR, CENTER FOR SLEEP DISORDERS, NATIONAL SLEEP FOUNDATION Dr. Roman. Good afternoon, Mr. Chairman and Congressional staff members. Thank you for inviting me to present testimony this morning, or this afternoon, on behalf of the National Sleep Foundation. We have submitted written testimony to the official record, and I would like to use my time to address some of the major points regarding how sleep disorders, sleep deprivation, and fatigue impact the Nation's health and safety. As the Chairman mentioned, I am based in Massillon, Ohio. I drive through Navarro, Ohio, his home town every day. I just want to make my Ohio connection clear. The National Sleep Foundation is an independent non-profit organization that works with thousands of sleep experts, patients, and drowsy driving victims throughout the country, to prevent health and safety problems, related to fatigue and untreated sleep disorders. The Foundation's interest today in the subcommittee's work is based on the National Sleep Foundation's relationship with the Center for Disease Control and Prevention, and specifically with the National Center for Injury Prevention and Control. The NSF today is asking the subcommittee to consider providing an additional $1.5 million to the center's fiscal year 2002 funding, to address sleep deprivation and fatigue- related injuries. Sleep represents a third of every person's life, and has a tremendous impact on how we function, perform, and think during the other two-thirds. Unfortunately, that is the first thing we sacrifice. We give up sleep to attend all these Congressional hearings and Congressional fund raisers later on in the evening. Too many of us forget that lack of adequate, restful slumber has serious consequences at home, in the work place, at school, and on the highway. Members of Congress are not immune to this. If you recall, Mr. Chairman, I did an informal survey a few years ago, with the help of your office. We found that seven percent of the Congressional members fall asleep during these Congressional hearings. Mr. Regula. Maybe it has got something to do with the witnesses. Dr. Roman. Well, hopefully it does not. The numbers were worse for the Congressional staff members, so I am not even going to mention that, just for them. It just shows that the ill effects of sleep deprivation are suffered by all, including members of Congress. This is something that touches each and every person in this country. Tragically, drowsy driving claims more than 1,500 lives, and accounts for at least 100,000 crashes in the UnitedStates, every year. The sad thing is that these incidents are preventable. Just this past week, Mr. Chairman, I saw a school bus driver from our community, who fell asleep at the wheel, and the kids are complaining about how the bus is wagging. I have seen many police officers, I have actually seen some of your Congressional members, I have seen elected officials from the school and the Government in our community; and so I do not put a face or a name today before you. However, I ask you, the next time you go to your community, look around and you will see that this is an issue that affects each and every one of us. Many of the groups before you, too, would benefit from my request today, or what the National Sleep Foundation is trying to accomplish through the CDC. Fatigue or sleep deprivation should be considered an impairment like alcohol and drugs. New research shows that a person who has been awake for 24 consecutive hours demonstrates the same impairment in judgment and reaction time, as an adult who is legally drunk. Today, it is unacceptable to drive or work under the influence of drugs and alcohol. Fatigue should fall under the same category. The National Sleep Foundation has worked with volunteers like myself for the next decade to raise awareness and minimize fatigue-related injuries. While public awareness is desperately needed, a strong Federal partner with the expertise and the ability to disseminate, test, and improve education, training and injury prevention programs to communities like ours in Stark County, Ohio, is crucial to attacking these problems. We feel that the CDC is our partner, and should help the NSF and public health officials address these problems. We have data telling us that lack of sleep affects the Nation on many different levels, from the airline pilot, and I have several pilots of that nature, to the child in the classroom, I receive many with a court order coming to see me; and from the Amish. Surprisingly, even though they have a simple life style, they are identifying sleep disorders as a problem in their day-to-day lives. This research is absolutely no good if we cannot translate it into education and injury prevention programs for the general public. Public education, physician and police training, school-based programs and work place prevention programs are all desperately needed. We believe that the CDC can and should play a vital role, working with the sleep community to address these problems by developing a sleep awareness plan that would set national priorities around sleep issues and public health and safety. This proposed sleep awareness program would allow the CDC and other Federal agencies to develop and distribute accurate medically sound information in programs to local communities. This information, coupled with training for those involved with public health and safety at the state level, will begin to turn the tide of injuries, health problems, and costs associated with sleepiness and sleep disorders, which I see on a daily basis. I thank you, Mr. Chairman, for your time. Again, we wish that the subcommittee would consider increasing the overall budget for the center by $1.5 million, to allow the center to act as a coordinating body for the development and implementation of this five year sleep awareness plan. Thank you for your consideration in this request. I would be glad to answer any questions that you may have. [The information follows:] [GRAPHIC(S) NOT AVAILABLE IN TIFF FORMAT] Mr. Regula. It seems to me that you are talking about two different things, disorders and deprivation. Deprivation is lifestyle. Dr. Roman. Yes, but we consider it a disorder, also, because many of the sleep disorders cause sleep deprivation. Only through education and awareness will people realize that it is just not lifestyle, and that there are other things going on. Mr. Regula. Do you try to treat physical causes, or just try to treat the habits of people; that they just do not get enough sleep, they do not go to bed on time, and so on. Dr. Roman. We do both, Mr. Chairman. Mr. Regula. Are there certain physical causes that people do not sleep well, and is that something you treat? Dr. Roman. Yes, the most common one that we see is sleep apnea. That is people who snore and stop breathing in their sleep. Most of their manifestation is, I do not get enough sleep, or I feel tried when I wake up. These are people who fall asleep in different social situations, including driving or at work, or even on the toilet seat. Mr. Regula. Well, I suppose our societal lifestyle has something to do with it, the demands are so great. Dr. Roman. Unfortunately, the first thing that we all sacrifice is sleep, to get in all the activities, social, professional, and personal, that we would like. What we aretrying to educate the public is, this is a major mistake. Mr. Regula. Is there any magic number? I see different numbers. You should have six hours, seven hours, eight hours. Would that not depend a little bit on the physiology on the individual? Dr. Roman. Yes, the average is around eight hours. But there are some people who require less sleep, and some that require more. You cannot train yourself to sleep less. That is a myth; where you can say, I can get by with only four hours. What we do as a society, most Americans, we are chronically sleep deprived, and on the weekends, we make up, we sleep in; which, unfortunately, makes us start off the next week in a bind. For example, next week, which is National Sleep Awareness Week, and our clock shifts forward, there is a seven percent increase in accidents that Monday. It does not matter if you spring forward or fall back with our clock, but there is a seven percent increase. So I strongly recommend that no one drive next Monday. Mr. Regula. You should stay home from work; is that it? [Laughter.] Well, you apparently have got an ally in our President. He seems to have good habits about going to bed early, and that will be helpful. Dr. Roman. He also takes naps, which we strongly recommend. Unfortunately, it is very un-American to take naps. Mr. Regula. I thinking about one, myself, if I can get through this list. [Laughter.] Dr. Roman. I thank you for your time, Mr. Chairman. I am available in our community, as I am your neighbor. I will always be available to you. Thank you very much. Mr. Regula. Well, thank you for coming. Next is Deborah Neale, a member of the Ohio Chapter Executive Committee of the Ohio State Public Affairs Committee. ---------- Wednesday, March 21, 2001. OHIO CHAPTER EXECUTIVE COMMITTEE OF THE OHIO STATE PUBLIC AFFAIRS COMMITTEE WITNESS DEBORAH NEAL, MEMBER, OHIO CHAPTER EXECUTIVE COMMITTEE OF THE OHIO STATE PUBLIC AFFAIRS COMMITTEE Ms. Neal. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. Good afternoon, I am Debbie Neal, a long time volunteer of the March of Dimes. I also bring you greetings from our former State Senator Grace Drake, who has just agreed to be on our committee in Cleveland, Ohio. As you know, the March of Dimes is a national voluntary health agency, founded in 1938 by President Roosevelt, to find a cure for polio. Today, the three million foundation volunteers and 1,600 staff members in every state, the District of Columbia, and Puerto Rico, work to improve the health of infants and children, by preventing birth defects and infant mortality. I am here today seeking the prioritization of funds to improve and health and well being of mothers, infants, and children, through research, prevention of birth defects, and developmental disabilities, and improved access to care. I am not here to lobby for funds for the March of Dimes, as less than one percent of the Foundation's funding comes from Federal sources. The Foundation supports continuing the five year effort to double the funding. We are especially interested in three issues within the National Institutes of Health. First, the National Institute for Child Health and Human Development should have the resources to expand research on birth defects and developmental biology, allowing for testing of new treatments for autism, and further research on Fragile X, which is the most common inherited cause of mental retardation. Secondly, we recommend increased funding for the National Human Genome Research Institute, to allow scientists to develop the next generation of research tools, and thereby accelerate an understanding of genomics. Third, other activities at NIH strongly supported by the Foundation include work being done by the National Center on Minority Health and Disparities; advancement of treatment options for sickle cell disease; and extra-mural research through the Pediatric Research Initiative. As you know, Mr. Chairman, last year, the Children's Health Act of 2000 created a new center on birth defects and developmental disabilities at CDC, bringing the number of centers that make up the CEC to seven. Support in Congress for this new center is indicative of the importance that members place on research and prevention activities related to birth defects. The new center begins operations in mid-April, April 15th, and we encourage the subcommittee to commit the resources needed to ensure a successful launch. Currently, three-quarters of the states monitor the incidents of birth defects. However, the systems vary considerably. CDC is working with states to standardize datacollection through 26 cooperative agreements, lasting three years each. However, funds are not adequate to support all the states seeking assistance, including our own state of Ohio. The March of Dimes recommends adding $2 million to CDC's state-based birth defects surveillance program. This CDC also supports eight regional birth defects research and prevention centers, where groundbreaking work on spina bifida, heart defects, Downs Syndrome, and other serious, life-threatening conditions present at birth are underway. Increased funding would allow additional data collection to study genetic and environmental causes of birth defects. The March of Dimes recommends adding $8 million to the budget for these eight centers. Developmental disabilities, monitoring and research are also important, and the Foundation supports CDC's plan to create five regional research centers to study developmental disabilities, such as autism, cerebral palsy, mental retardation, and hearing and vision deficits. The funding needed is $5 million. The new Center on Birth Defects and Developmental Disabilities will administer the folic acid education campaign and newborn screening program. The current folic acid education campaign has been inadequate, and should be funded at a greater level of $5 million for 2002, with an estimate by 2006. This life-saving intervention is needed to reduce the number of babies born with neural tube defects. Newborn screening for metabolic diseases and functional disorders such as PKU, sickle cell disease, and hearing impairment is a great advance in preventative medicine. To support newborn screening, the foundation recommends an increase, so that CDC can provide states the technical assistance needed to ensure that babies who test positive for these conditions receive appropriate care. Finally, we would like to focus your attention on two programs, administered by the Health Resources and Services Administration, that improve access to health care for mothers and children. The Maternal and Child Health Block Grant compliments Medicaid and the Children's Health Insurance Program. It is no wonder we call it CHIP. That is easier to say. This program targets service to under-served populations. The foundation recommends funding at the authorized level of $850 million. Secondly, community health centers are an essential source of obstetric and pediatric care, and the foundation supports $175 million in new funds, to increase both the number of centers, and improve the scope of services offered. Thank you for allowing me to testify today. [The information follows:] [GRAPHIC(S) NOT AVAILABLE IN TIFF FORMAT] Mr. Regula. Was it the March of Dimes started to eradicate polio? Ms. Neal. It was. Mr. Regula. So you heard the success story of that? Ms. Neal. It is. In fact, our friend, Pat Sweeney, has always said, it should change its name from the March of Dimes to the March of Quarters, because of inflation. [Laughter.] Mr. Regula. Right, but it was a tremendous success story. Ms. Neal. Well, it is fascinating to listen to the doctor talk about eradication worldwide. I mean, it is in our lifetimes that this has happened. Mr. Regula. I believe he said that they vaccinated 107,000, I believe. Ms. Neal. Yes, at one time. Mr. Regula. No, that was million, 170 million. That is great progress to make those achievements. We hope we can have the same success with birth defects. Ms. Neal. One of the reasons that I have chosen to be a volunteer with March of Dimes for so many years is because they do accomplish a lot of real concrete success stories. Mr. Regula. Well, thank you for coming. Ms. Neal. Thank you. Mr. Regula. Next is Dr. Amy Lee, Assistant Professor of Community Medicine, from Northern Ohio. ---------- Wednesday, March 21, 2001. FRIENDS OF THE HEALTH RESOURCES AND SERVICES ADMINISTRATION WITNESS AMY LEE, MD, MPH, MBA, FRIENDS OF THE HEALTH RESOURCES AND SERVICES ADMINISTRATION Dr. Lee. Actually, besides your wonderful support to my academic institution, I have a brother who lives in Stark County, and my real estate agent works with your son, David, at Cutler GMA. That is my Ohio connection. Mr. Regula. My goodness. Dr. Lee. I am honored to be here today to testify on behalf of the Friends of the Health Resources and Services Administration or HRSA. The Friends of HRSA is an advocacy coalition of 125 national organizations, and it represents millions of public health and health care professionals, academicians such as myself, and consumers. HRSA programs assure that all Americans have access to basic health care services. In Ohio, in fact, three fourths of our public health funding comes from Federal sources, and HRSA plays a major role in this support. HRSA is a health safety net for nearly 43 million Americans, who lack health insurance; 49 million Americans who live in areas that have little access to primary health care services; and also African American babies who are 2.4 times more likely than their white counterparts to die before their first birthday. The Agency's overriding goal is to provide 100 percent access to health care, with zero disparities. The Friends of HRSA feel the Agency requires a funding level of at least $6.7 billion in order to achieve this goal. HRSA funding goes where the needs exists. Although programs are geared towards health care access, I would just like to highlight two programs, and mention several others. The first program is the new community access program. It allows communities to build partnerships among health care providers to deliver a broader range of health services to uninsured and under-served residents. Cincinnati actually received a CAP grant, and was one of the highest grant applications. This program coordinates some 50 organizations in this area through strategies to improve care, including the implementation of regional disease, management protocols for asthma, depression, diabetes and hypertension. The Friends are very concerned that the Administration's budget blueprint recommends eliminating this program of coordinated service delivery. This is an innovative program that is not duplicated anywhere else. The next program I would like to highlight is the health professions programs, which assure adequate national work force, despite projected nationwide shortages of nurses, pharmacists, and other professionals. Actually, Dr. Goldberg speak on behalf of this program, as well. Graduates of these programs are three to ten times more likely to practice in under-served areas. In addition, they are two to five times more likely to be minorities. The Friends are also concerned that cuts in these programs, which are proposed in the Administration's budget blueprint will impact this poorly. These programs provide up-front incentives for dozens of types of health professionals, not only physicians, but mental health, dentists, and also public health professionals, as well. Market forces will continue to drive shortages and mal- distribution in many of these sectors, potentially leaving health centers under-staffed, without the support of health professions programs. Also, it is clear for the need for other HRSA programs, as well. The Maternal and Child Health Block Grant provided funds for the Cleveland Healthy Start Program, and they saw a 40 percent in infant mortality, as a result. I really did not need to look any further than my local newspaper, the Akron Beacon Journal, to find other sources of need. On February 20th, the Akron Beacon Journal reported ``HIV stalks careless men.'' It reported that HIV is increasing in numbers in young people and heterosexuals. HRSA, next to Medicaid, provides the largest source of funding for AIDS programs, for low income and under-insured Americans. Over the weekend, actually, they ran a series of Ohioans spreading out, and blacks flee to suburbia. This told of folks who were going to suburban areas and rural areas to stay and to live there. Of course, there will be more need for programs such as the programs provided by HRSA to provide health care services. I would like to submit these three articles for the record, as well. Mr. Regula. Without objection. [The referenced articles follow:] [GRAPHIC(S) NOT AVAILABLE IN TIFF FORMAT] Dr. Lee. As you can see, HRSA programs are all about access to health care for Americans. We are really, because if we have a toothache or if we get sick, we know where to go, and we will get taken care of. For millions of these Americans, it is not that easy. I would like to close with a story from a HRSA-funded vision specialty clinic; actually from your district in Wayne County in Wooster. On one occasion, a four year old boy was taken in by one of the Head Start Clinic staff, because they thought he might have problems seeing. They found, on exam, that he was functionally blind. Because of the actions of the crack staff, this boy had glasses in three days. After he put the glasses on, the doctors said, he passed the smile test, because when they put the glasses on, the boy had a huge grin. For the next few days, the days said that he just looked at things and people that he had never really seen before, because he had these glasses, and due to the services of this HRSA specialty care clinic. I do not think it is by accident that we have heard a number of public witnesses here that have spoken on behalf of HRSA programs, because HRSA offers that link between the services and the people that need it the most. Thank you for this opportunity for me to speak on behalf of the Friends of HRSA. I welcome any questions. Mr. Regula. Well, do you, in your role as Professor of Community Medicine, work with the physicians in training there? Dr. Lee. I work with a few. Actually, I am mostly an Administrator. I direct the master public health program, which is a partnership program of five public institutions there. I am also involved in public health activities through the Ohio Public Health Association. I am President this year, as well. I am a little involved in the medical student training. Mr. Regula. But the public health programs would be delivered by physicians and/or nurses, I assume? Dr. Lee. Actually, the master public health program, it could be physicians, but also nurses, health care administrators, for them to better provide health care services to communities, as opposed to individuals. Mr. Regula. I assume the community health centers would be something where you would have a direct involvement. Dr. Lee. Actually, I sat on the board for the one in Akron, and because of a lot of other responsibilities, I had to give that up. But I was very much involved in that community health center for awhile. Mr. Regula. Are you using the new center up there, that you bring in people for lectures? Dr. Lee. Oh, that center has not been built, yet. Mr. Regula. You have not got it built? Dr. Lee. No, no, the ground has not been broken, yet. Mr. Regula. Oh, my. Dr. Lee. They are still making the plans. Mr. Regula. Well, at least you have the money. Dr. Lee. Yes, yes, thanks to you. [Laughter.] Mr. Regula. Okay, thank you for coming. Thank you for coming. Our witness is doctor James Pearsol. ---------- Wednesday, March 21, 2001. CENTER FOR DISEASE CONTROL AND PREVENTION (CDC) COALITION WITNESS JAMES A. PEARSOL, BA, MED, CHIEF, OFFICE OF POLICY AND LEADERSHIP, OHIO DEPARTMENT OF HEALTH Mr. Pearsol. Good afternoon, Mr. Chairman and Members of the Subcommittee. You may be a Cleveland Indians fan. If you are, then maybe you know Jimmy Person, who has quite a baseball player and quite a character. I am not a baseball player, but I probably qualify as a character. I am honored to be here today to testify on behalf of the CDC Coalition. The CDC Coalition is a nonpartisan association with more than 100 hundred groups committed to strengthening the Nation's prevention programs. Coalition members groups represent millions of public health workers, researchers, educators, and citizens served by CDC Coalition programs. I would like to welcome the Chairman into his new position. In addition, overseeing the funding for Public Health Service and to thank you for the work that you will do in the forthcoming year on this difficult bill. The CDC Coalition is the Nation's prevention agency that is putting health research into practice. Public health prevention is about two things. The what of health prevention is preventing adverse health outcomes and the how are the tools of the trades including programs, surveillance, and best practices. Prevention translates into lives saved and pain and suffering avoided, health costs avoided, quality of life improved, use of best health practices, and use of credible health information. In the best professional judgement of the CDC Coalition, CDC will require funding of a least $5 billion to adequately fulfill its mission for fiscal year 2002. Mr. Regula. Do you work directly with CDC? Mr. Pearsol. Yes. We receive, again, probably $40 million of our budget, part of the three-fourths of Federal funding at the Ohio Department of Health, and pass that on in large measure to local health and community departments. Mr. Regula. The funding is channeled through CDC. Mr. Pearsol. Correct. Mr. Regula. The Federal portion. Mr. Pearsol. That is correct. Mr. Regula. You in turn work with local public health agencies in the communities around Ohio. Mr. Pearsol. That is correct. Mr. Regula. The State County Board of Health would be working directly with to you. Mr. Pearsol. I work directly for them, Bill Franks and his Board, the city, Bob Patteson, and Mayor Watkins. Mr. Regula. Go ahead. Mr. Pearsol. Thank you. Health prevention is like auto maintenance. It is not appreciated until it fails. It is not much fun when it fails. In any maintenance of prevention ignored is guaranteed to lead to failure. CDC makes Public Works in Ohio, and I will give you some examples. Chronic diseases are Ohio's quiet killer. Five diseases account for 70 percent of Ohio's deaths. In fact, heart disease, 91 deaths each day, cancer, 68 deaths each day, stroke, 18 deaths each day, lung disease, 15 deaths each day, and diabetes, nine deaths each day. The CDC Center for Chronic Disease Prevention and Health Promotion supports programs that combat this chronic set of diseases. The impact on the elderly is profound and about 80 percent of seniors have at least one chronic condition and 50 percent have two or more. We know that breast and cervical cancer, prostate, lung, and colon rectal cancers can be avoided through early detection. The CDC supports programs like these and other chronic illness such as diabetes. Nearly 16 million Americans have diabetes and the largest increases are among adults 30 to 39 in age. CDC supports state and territorial diabetes control programs that attack this problem. Health disparities persist in all of these disease that I talk about in Ohio. This CDC's REACH program that is racial and ethnic approaches to community health address serious disparities and infant mortality, breast and cervical cancer, HIV and AIDS, etc. In Ohio, infant mortality rates for African American are twice those of whites. One of Ohio's Public Health Service success stories is childhood immunizations. In 1994, only about half of our two year old had been immunized by 2001 and 78 percent had been immunized, which is a 55 percent increase. This was possible through the availability of low cost vaccine from CDC. Injuries and their prevention is crucial. Each day an average of 9,000 U.S. workers sustained disabling injuries, 17 died from work related injuries, and 137 died from work related illnesses. Finally, the preventive help block grant is the key to flexible funding at the local level were local program can match solutions to demand in the local community. The how of CDC is cease surveillance. This is a lot like an air traffic control system. It is the disease tracking control system. It is a basic monitoring system that detects early warning signs. The National Electronic Disease surveillance system created Ohio's early warning system for disease outbreaks. The Epidemic Intelligence Service Officer Corps has supported many outbreak investigations in Ohio and including TB outbreak in Columbus, Typhoid outbreak in Cincinnati, Listeria in northwest Ohio; part of a National outbreak, Cryptosporidiosis in a Delaware county swimming pool, and E. coli in Medina county fair grounds water system. In terms of capacities and skills, the CDC Coalition supports full funding for the provisions authorized in the Pubic Health threat emergency act sponsored by representative Burns Stewpack. This concluded my prepared remarks. I would be happy to answer any questions. [The justification follows:] [GRAPHIC(S) NOT AVAILABLE IN TIFF FORMAT] Mr. Regula. Do you work any with the schools as part of an education program for preventive medicine? Mr. Pearsol. Yes. We work directly school program with nursing staff and the Public Health teachers. In order to get the message to the community. Mr. Regula. There are a lot of gains that could be made in preventive medicine to achieve good health, that is to develop programs of preventive medicine to alert people. Mr. Pearsol. Yes, that is right. We believe this is the key. Ohioans smoke more are more obese, exercise less, and eat fewer fruits and vegetables. Those are behaviors that can change the kinds of chronic diseases that I am mentioned that kill Ohioans and others in Americans in this country. Mr. Regula. Is it an education process? Mr. Pearsol. Yes, education is part of the process. It is changing the behaviors and repeating the message. Mr. Regula. Thank you. Mr. Pearsol. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. Mr. Regula. Our next witness is Gerald Slavet. Ms. Hurley-Wales. It is Slavet. Mr. Regula. I am intrigued by ``From the Top.'' Is that Ringling Brothers? Mr. Hurley-Wales. No, it is a radio program. Mr. Regula. Oh, where is it? Mr. Hurley-Wales. Actually, in your area, it is on WCLV in Cleveland. Mr. Regula. What kind of a program is it? Mr. Hurley-Wales. Well, I am happy to answer that. Mr. Regula. I guess you are going to tell us. Mr. Hurley-Wales. Right, I will tell you all about it. Mr. Regula. Okay. ---------- Wednesday, March 21, 2001. GERALD SLAVET EDUCATION PERFORMANCES FOUNDATION WITNESS JENNIFER HURLEY-WALES, EXECUTIVE VICE PRESIDENT, GERALD SLAVET EDUCATION PERFORMANCES FOUNDATION Ms. Hurley-Wales. My name is Jennifer Hurley-Wales. I am here to testify on behalf of Gerald Slavet of the Education Performances Foundation. Gerald is out of the country today. We were very appreciative to have this opportunity to appear before you and the Subcommittee. I am the Executive Vice President of our foundation and co- founder of our flagship project ``From the Top.'' Since its launch in 1998, ``From the Top'' radio program has brought into the foreground the exceptional achievements of pre-collegiality classical musicians. It helped build the self esteem of the young participants, and provided role models for 100 to 1,000 young people across the United States. The mission of ``From the Top'' is to celebrate and encourage the development of youth through music. The project is designed to demystify classical music making it more accessible to young audiences and adults. ``From the Top'' believes that young people that can play Mozart's Clarinet Concerto are just as cool as those who dunk basketballs. We know those who play that kind of music are usually strong students and that is why we celebrate young classical musicians in the same way that their athletic schoolmates are-- as heroes. Early involvement with classical music plays a key role in the development of children's intellects, which is important for the new economy that relies on math, science, and analytical skills. We believe that ``From the Top's'' is entertaining and accessible and national radio program will lead to a public conversation at the grass roots level. Perhaps this will help influence public opinion and policy about the value of arts education. ``From the Top's'' weekly radio series taped before a live audience, features America's most exceptional 9- to 18-year-old classical musicians and performance and interviews. Now broadcast on 215 station nationwide, the show has a projected listenership of 700,000 people each week. A passionate listenership I should say as demonstrated by the daily flood of positive e-mails we continue to receive. Mr. Regula. Do you go nationwide? Ms. Hurley-Wales. We are on 215 stations nationwide. Mr. Regula. Produced in Cleveland? Ms. Hurley-Wales. It was produced in Boston. Mr. Regula. OK. Ms. Hurley-Wales. ``From the Top'' is considered today the most listened to classical music program on public radio. Tapings take place before family audiences in Boston at New England Conservatory's Jordan Hall and in halls across the country including Carnegie Hall in New York and the Kennedy Center in Washington. In fact, we will be here next week. The extraordinary popularity and success of ``From the Top'' radio series has led to the creation of three additional components. ``From the Top'' television specials are in development for production for PBS. They will feature host Christopher O'Riley, performances and documentary style profiles of five exceptional young musicians and ensembles. ``From the Top.org'' is the only site on the Internet that provides a complete suite of services and community for young people who are passionate about music. The site is an interactive forum for kids, teachers, and parents to discuss, present, and research all matters that relate to music. ``From the Top's'' newest initiative, Sound Waves education project addresses the urgent need to bring cultural missionaries into our communities through curricular materials linked to the radio shows, teacher training workshops, and cultural leadership training for young musicians. This Sound Wave project builds on ``From the Top's'' greatest asset and the power of the young performer as a role model for other kids. Thanks to the interest and leadership of Congressman Joe Moakley, and the support of this Subcommittee, our foundation has received funding from the U.S. Department of Education in the past, including a $510,000 grant for this fiscal year. ``From the Top'' would not be in existence without the U.S. DOE funding. Please know that we are aware of the importance in improving our funding and we mounted a comprehensive development effort to that effect. We appreciate the support of this Subcommittee and we now respectfully request that you extend your commitment to young people and the arts by providing a $1.25 million grant to Education Performances Foundation to continue support for this innovative program. This grant would allow us to further develop and implement our cultural leadership training and expand the reach of educational efforts through school, community, and Internet- based programs. Your continued support would allow the overwhelmingly positive impact of ``From the Top'' to continue and multiply for the greater mission of our project to be reached. Thank you. [The justification follows:] [GRAPHIC(S) NOT AVAILABLE IN TIFF FORMAT] Mr. Regula. Thank you. I thought that I left the arts when I left Interior. The next witness is Joseph E. Pizzorno, President Emeritus of Bastyr University in Seattle, Washington. ---------- Wednesday, March 21, 2001. BASTYR UNIVERSITY WITNESS JOSEPH E. PIZZORNO, JR., PRESIDENT EMERITUS, BASTYR UNIVERSITY IN SEATTLE, WASHINGTON Mr. Regula. Do you know my friend Sled Gordon? Mr. Pizzorno. Actually, I have talked to him several times. Mr. Regula. We worked together on Interior matters. Mr. Pizzorno. Great. You said Washington like a true native. You must have spent some time with him. Mr. Regula. We spent quite a bit of time together. He was Chairman and I was Chairman of house, parks, and forests. We also took care of the flagship in your part of the world. You are in Seattle. Mr. Pizzorno. Yes. Mr. Regula. OK. We look forward from hearing from you. Mr. Pizzorno. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. My name is Joseph Pizzorno. I am a licensed naturopathic physician in the state of Washington. I am also the founding President of Bastyr University. The first fully credited institution of natural medicine in the United States. I am also a member of the Seattle County Board of Health. The Chair of special interest groups on Alternative Medicine for the American Public Health Association. I have also been appointed to the White House Commission on Complementary and Alternative Medicine Policy. This was created by Congress to advise Congress on how to integrate natural medicine into the health care system. While I am very active in several of these organizations, and have 25 years of leadership in natural medicine, education, research, and health policy innovation, I am not here representing any particular organization. I am here because I believe that the most pervasive and silently accepted crisis in America today is ill health of our people. We have a health care system that is oriented towards disease treatment and symptom relief, but does relative little to actually restoring and promoting people's health. Every decade, for the past 50 years, the incidence of chronic and degenerative disease has increased in virtually every age group in the past 50 years. The message that I am presenting to you today is somewhat different from the message you have heard earlier today. Our current health care system is excellent in many ways, such as acute conditions and emergency care, but it is not particularly effective in restoring and promoting health. Health promotion is the area in which natural medicine is most effective. My written testimony addresses several areas and defines: What is Complementary in Alternative Medicine? How popular is CAM? Why is it important in heath care? Who are the CAM professionals? What state of the research in CAM? What are the critical issues that determine if the full benefits of CAM will be experienced by the American people. Finally, I present specific recommendations to the Subcommittee. What is CAM? It is something that is know by many names. Natural medicine, alternative medicine, integrative medicine, and complementary medicine. It seems that our government is now calling it CAM. I will use CAM in my further address. When many people think about CAM, they think about it as simply substituting natural therapies for drugs and surgery. That is not what natural medicine is about. It is about philosophical approach to heath care fundamentally difference from that of the conventional medicine. It is about health promotion rather than disease treatment, about correcting the underlying causes of ill health rather than system relief. It is about improvement in function rather than waiting for end stage pathology that requires heroic intervention. It is about education, healthy lifestyles, self care, and natural health products rather than dependence on medical doctors. It is about supporting the body's own healing processes rather than turning to drugs to support or replace by systems. It is about a powerful belief in the inherent ability of the body to heal if just given a chance. These concepts of healing change the way in which we think about and provide health care. Why are these concepts important to health care? Americans are experiencing unpresitant burden of ill health and disease worsening disease trends, appallingly high incidence of treatment side effects and out of control health care costs. There are a lot of statistic in my written testimony. Of the 191 countries that maintain health statistics, the United States rant seventy second in health status according to the World Heath Organization. According to Christopher Muray, M.D., Director of WHO's Global Program on Evidence for Health Policy. Basically, you die earlier and spend more time disabled if you are an American rather than a member of most advanced countries. One of the key differences between health care in the United States and most of the rest of the world, especially those ranking higher in health statistics, is significantly higher healthier life styles and in several countries such as number two ranked Australia, and much greater use of CAM in natural health care products. In fact, in both European countries, ranking above the United States in health care statistics, the lead prescription drugs are herbal medicines and not synthetic chemicals. CAM is most effective precisely in those area weakest in conventional medicine. How popular is CAM? 42 percent of Americans now seek the services of natural medicine practitioners. There were 629 million visits in natural medicine practitioners in 1997, which was more than primary medical doctors for primary care. What can I recommend to this committee? Currently, the primary mechanism for Federal funding in CAM research is through the NIH National Center for CAM research. It receives less than one percent of the NIH total budget and that is inadequate to meet the need of the mission. The state of CAM research is widely misunderstood. It is easily dismissed as having no evidence. In fact, there is tremendous amount of evidence supporting the natural medicine. The textbook of natural medicine 10,000 citations of peer review scientific literature documenting the authenticity of these kinds of interventions. I would like to leave you with one recommendation. We have experience tremendous benefits in our country form having invest a lot of resources in conventional medicine research. We have invested less than one half of one percent in research into natural medicine. I believe that we can experience the same kind of benefits if we engage in more natural medicine and reap the benefits of the centuries long traditions of healing. Thank you. [The justification follows:] [GRAPHIC(S) NOT AVAILABLE IN TIFF FORMAT] Mr. Regula. Thank you. Mr. Peterson must be delayed arriving. I take one more and hopefully he will get here. Mr. Akhter. I have a meeting with the Secretary of Education. If you can cut it short, that would be helpful. ---------- Wednesday, March 21, 2001. AMERICAN PUBLIC HEALTH ASSOCIATION WITNESS MOHAMMAD AKHTER, EXECUTIVE DIRECTOR, AMERICAN PUBLIC HEALTH ASSOCIATION Mr. Akhter. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. My name is Mohammad Akhter. I am the Executive Director of the American Public Health Association. We have 55,000 members and they are primary concerned with the health of the American people. I am not here to testify and support particular agency, particular program or special group of people, but just the American people. Mr. Regula. You have heard the testimony. Will your testimony be similar to what we have heard. Mr Akhter. No. It is very specific. Let me point out to you three or four areas we think the major emphasis should be really help the American people be healthy and happier for the future. First, there are health disparities among our Americans. We have made tremendous progress in life expectancy, immunization, and other arenas. I have been health commissioner in Washington, DC. I have been state health director for the state of Missouri. We have done wonderful work. However, some of minority do not enjoy the same health status. The number of minorities is increasing. By 2050, there will be 50 percent of all people of racial ethnic descent. We cannot have a strong Nation if some of our people our suffering this disproportionately from heart disease and cancer. For example, the infant mortality rate is twice as high for the African American than it is for the average American. Similarly, the death rate from the diabetes is twice as high for Hispanics as it is for rest of the country. Last year, Congress passed a bill and created a center in the NIH for minority health. Mr. Chairman, we respectfully request that the center be fully funded so it can get its work going. In addition, we are asking that you fund the agency for health care research and quality so that research can be taken to the people at large to be able to help people. Secondly, Mr. Chairman, these were the issues that are very near and dear to most Americans. The second most important problem among our communities is the substance abuse problem. Many of the social and public health problems have root cause is the substance abuse. President has put some additional money in the budget for substance abuse treatment. We hope that the Subcommittee will look at this carefully. We will push that forward. The third area is our seniors. 80 percent of them have one chronic condition and 50 percent have two or more. They become utterly disabled and have to go to nursing home or need more medical care. HCFA has started a new program were they have combined the company assessment with health promotion disease prevention and treatment. We can keep people healthier in their own homes. Not only improve theirquality of life, but also save some money. Finally, Mr. Chairman, last year, the Congress passes a bill to deal with the bad terrorism to repair our Nation. The responsibility for this was placed in the Center for Disease Control in Atlanta. It is a problem today, as it was last year. We need to fund that completely so that we can have our communities prepared and our people protected. Lastly, Mr. Chairman, like the economy, disease is also become global. Now the hoof mouth disease. A disease can come at any time. We have the best scientist in the world. We need to make them available to other countries so that they can contain the disease at a local level. The Office of International Health, CDC, NIH where they have these experts, that those programs be funded so that the programs can be available to other countries so we do need to fight the diseases once its inside of our borders. Mr. Chairman, I appreciate very much the opportunity to testify before you. I would be glad to answer any questions. [The justification follows:] [GRAPHIC(S) NOT AVAILABLE IN TIFF FORMAT] Mr. Regula. Thank you for your testimony. You are absolutely right. Announce prevention. It is worth a pound of cures, they always say. Thank you for being here. Our next witness is Marianne Comegys. I appreciate the patients of all of you. Somebody has to be last. Francine makes out the list so do not hold me responsible. [Laughter.] ---------- Wednesday, March 21, 2001. MEDICAL LIBRARY ASSOCIATION AND THE ASSOCIATION OF ACADEMIC HEALTH SCIENCES LIBRARIES WITNESS MARIANNE COMEGYS, CHAIR, MLA GOVERNMENT RELATIONS COMMITTEE, MEDICAL LIBRARY ASSOCIATION AND THE ASSOCIATION OF ACADEMIC HEALTH SCIENCES LIBRARIES Ms. Comegys. I am Marianne Comegys, Associate Professor at Louisiana State University Health Science Library in Shreveport, Louisiana. I am pleased to testify on behalf of the Medical Library Association and the Association of Academic Health Sciences Libraries regarding fiscal year 2002 budget for the National Library of Medicine. MLA is a professional organization representing 1200 institutions and 4,000 individuals involved in the management and dissemination of biomedical information. AAHSI is compromised of the directors of libraries of 142 accredited U.S. and Canadian medical schools. The NLM is the world's largest medical library with 5.8 million items through National network of regional libraries. MLM ensures that health professionals and the public have access to health prevention and treatment. Mr. Regula. OK. You have sold me. Where do you get your funding? What does it come through. Ms. Comegys. It comes through NIH. The NLM is one of the agencies within NIH. Mr. Regula. Your effort would be to get more funding for NIH. Ms. Comegys. Right, through the NLM. Mr. Regula. So that can give you more money. Ms. Comegys. Specifically, to the NLM as well. Mr. Regula. You would like that to be mentioned in the report. Ms. Comegys. Right. Mr. Regula. I got the message. You will have to wrap up in a minute or two. Ms. Comegys. Okay, I will. I will mention that recognizing the invaluable role that NLM plays in our health care delivery system, NLM also joins with ad hoc for medical research funding, and recommends a 16.5 percent increase for NLM in the NIH in fiscal year 2002. Many of our programs today, that the other witnesses have testified to, and one of the important issues that I will just sort of mention and sort of just regard this today since you are in a hurry, is that we provide, as the medical library community, the information resources necessary for those. Mr. Regula. Who uses your services, doctors? Ms. Comegys. The public, the health care physicians, and right now, there is a big push for consumer health. Mr. Regula. Well, if I wanted to use your services as a layman, where would I go? Ms. Comegys. You can go now to the public libraries; you can go to the medical libraries. But what we are doing now and what the National Library of Medicine has done is emphasize the consumer, and what wehave provided for you, Mr. Chairman, is easy access to this information through user-friendly databases. Mr. Regula. Here comes my pinch hitters. Now you have go lots of time. [Laughter.] Mr. Peterson [assuming chair]. He said you had lots of time, so take it. Ms. Comegys. Well, okay, I will start over. Do I still have that five minutes? On behalf of the Medical Library Community, I thank the subcommittee for the leadership in securing a 15 percent increase for NLM in fiscal year 2001. With respect to the library's budget for next year, I will address four issues: NLM's basic services outreach and telemedicine activities, PUBMED Central and the clinical trials database, and a need for a new library building. It is a tribute to NLML that the demand for its services continues to steadily increase each year. There are more than 250 million Internet searches annually on the Medicine database. Mr. Chairman, NLM is a national treasure. I can tell you that without NLM, our Nation's medical libraries would be unable to provide the type of information services that our Nation's health care providers, educators, researchers, and patients have come to expect. NLM's outreach programs are designed to educate medical librarians, health care professionals and the public about NLM services. The need for enhanced outreach activities has grown in recent years, following the library's decision to provide free access to its Medicine databases. Mr. Chairman, we applaud the success of NLM's outreach initiatives, and look forward to continuing our work with them on these important programs. Telemedicine also continues to hold great promise for dramatically increasing the delivery of health care to under-served communities. NLM has sponsored over 50 telemedicine related projects in recent years. Introduced in 2000, PUBMED Central is an on-line collection of live science articles, which evolved from an electronic publishing concept, initially proposed by former NIH director, Dr. Harold Varmus. This new on-line resource will significantly increase access to biomedical information, and we encourage the subcommittee to continue to support its development. I also want to comment on a new NLM service. It is the clinical trials database. This service is free, and it logs more than two million hits a month. It is an invaluable resource, which lists 5,000 Federal and privately-funded trials for serious or life-threatening diseases. In order for NLM to continue its mission, a few facility is urgently needed. Over the past two decades, the library has assumed several new responsibilities, particularly in the areas of biotechnology, high performance computing, and consumer health. As a result, the library has had tremendous growth in its basic functions. An increase in the volume of biomedical information, as well as library personnel, has resulted in a serious shortage of library space. The medical library community is pleased that Congress last year appropriated the necessary architectural and engineering funds for facility expansion at NLM. We encourage the subcommittee to continue to provide the resources necessary to acquire a new facility, and to support the library's information programs. Thank you for the opportunity to present the view of the medical library community. [The justification follows:] [GRAPHIC(S) NOT AVAILABLE IN TIFF FORMAT] Mr. Peterson. Who all has access to the library. Ms. Comegys. To the databases of the libraries? Mr. Peterson. Yes. Ms. Comegys. Everyone, from the physician to the researcher to the consumer; and one of the pushes that the National Library of Medicine has had for the last few years, and it has actually come the demand of the consumer, is that they know more about themselves and their health, and where to find this type of information. So Medline, which is a database of references and articles, now is free, on the web. It is easily accessible amd the user- friendly version is called Medline-Plus. Mr. Peterson. Medline-Plus.com? Ms. Comegys. Well, Medline-Plus is actually through NIH NLM, and then I think Medline-Plus is a database that lists 450 different health topics. Within that database, there is also dictionaries. There are consumer health links to other information on specific diseases. There is drug information. There is information on physicians within each territory. There is also, as I mentioned, the clinical trials database, and that is also quite accessible for anyone. So you, as a patient, or you, as a family member of someone who has a serious or life threatening disease, could go in, look on the clinical trials database, which is on theweb, which is free, and see which clinical trials are available right now, which are those that will be available. Then you, as an informed patient now, or informed family member, can go to your physician and say, you know, this is something that I think I would be interested in and want to participate in. It gives you all of the criteria listed, as well. So one of the pushes for NLM is the consumer and the consumer health, along with the human genome project which, of course, is for the researcher, and it is that enormous DNA data sequencing information, of course, which all the researchers in the U.S. and worldwide are so excited about. So we are from the researcher, as well as to the consumer. Mr. Peterson. If I was to inform my constituents on how they could utilize this, what should I tell them? Ms. Comegys. You can actually tell them, in Pennsylvania, they can go to their public libraries and have access to it. You can actually tell them to look on the Internet, just to search at home under National Library of Medicine. Within that website, it gives you all of the databases that I have described, plus others that they can have access to, free of charge. I can get you the website information. That is something that more and more people utilize, the Med-line databases. As I mentioned in my report, I think it mentioned so many million hits. Thirty percent of that is actually from the public, and that is probably increasing every day. Mr. Peterson. The rest is doctors, hospitals. Ms. Comegys. Researchers, health care professionals, and medical students. Mr. Peterson. If you could give us a short paper on that. Ms. Comegys. I will do that. Mr. Peterson. We may bog down the system. Ms. Comegys. Well, that is great. Do you know, the National Library of Medicine has sort of looked at those statistics, and they have never been down. They have continued to keep the web site. That is good, because they were actually surprised at the increase that has come about from that database. That is why they have gone to more and more of the consumer-based database. We, in the medical library community, work with the National Library of Medicine, through regional medical libraries. We go out, through grants from NLM, and train the public librarians on how to search for this information. We train the health care professionals on how to search it. We have grants to train the public health professionals on how to search, and how to help the patient, so that it is not just the patient out there, trying to search it with not as much knowledge as maybe they needed. But actually, it is quite user friendly. You could get on there today, and find out all sorts of information. Mr. Peterson. I shall do that. Ms. Comegys. The other thing is that I want to mention that, it is an accurate up to date databases. One of the concerns is that I think is with all the medical literature out there on the web. How accurate, reliable or up to date is the information. When you come to our databases, that is what you are getting is good information. Mr. Peterson. I wonder if real physicians use that often. Ms. Comegys. Yes, that is one of the other projects within the outreach projects with the NLM. Many of the grants are given to the regional medical library groups. There are eight regional library groups and through those groups, the grants are distributed to the local areas. The push for the rural and the medically undeserved areas. Telemedicine also comes in now to also help within those areas. Those in those areas that are medically undeserved have no less health information than those in the large cities. This is real important to us as well. Mr. Peterson. How does your telemedicine project work? Ms. Comegys. They all work quite differently. You can have telemedicine where it is the consultation from a small town physician who is sending visual images. We can do this now because of the technology. The high bandwidth and the wheel time video imaging that is available to us now. Small town physician can actually send these visuals images to the specialist in the larger city. The specialist in the large city can work on diagnosis and treatment. The patient would not have to travel to that large facility and that city. On a personal level right now in Louisiana at the Louisiana State University, we have a telemedicine program that we are working with the prisoners at a correctional institution in Louisiana. Our physicians at LSU are looking at information at the prison for those physicians there and then we are diagnosing and sending treatment information back to them so that they do not have to transport those prisoners to Shreveport or any other major facility. It can be used whether is it consultations with the physician and a patient. There is a lot of home health telemedicine projects. You can use it for continuing education with the physician and the student, who many of our students are in rural areas in Louisiana. Louisiana has a lot of rural areas. The patient themselves sort through some telemedicine projects and having access to the electronic resources. Mr. Peterson. Thank you very much. Ms. Comegys. Thank you. Thursday, March 22, 2001. MEMBER OF CONGRESS WITNESS HON. LOUIS STOKES, A REPRESENTATIVE IN CONGRESS FROM THE STATE OF OHIO Mr. Regula. We'll get started. I see we have many interested people again. I think it's great that you're here. A lot of you are going to a lot of trouble to be here to testify for your cause, and that's what this country's all about. I know that it's time and money that you have to do, but you're not only helping your cause, you're helping a lot of others who are going to follow along. Really, it's a very generous thing for each of you to come and bring to our attention the importance of something that's close to your heart. This Committee does have a lot of challenges, obviously. This is our sixth day of public witnesses. We have the former chairman of this Committee with us this morning, Mr. Lou Stokes from Cleveland. How many years did you chair this, Lou? Mr. Stokes. About as long as the committee, Mr. Chairman, 24 years. Mr. Regula. Twenty-four years. I need you as a consultant. I've been on it for about 24 days. Mr. Stokes. You'll do fine, Mr. Chairman. Mr. Regula. Lou's out practicing law in Cleveland, Ohio. He did a lot of good things, not only here, but the other committees, and we're happy that you're here today. Just a few of the rules. We have the boxes here which are timekeepers. I hate to do it, but we have to. We have about 28 today, and we've had 28 most every--this is the sixth day. I think it's indicative of the great interest that the public has in this Committee, is the fact that we've had so many, and then on top of that, we had to have a lottery to decide who would get to be even a public witness, because the requests are far more than we can accommodate. But it's great that you bring these things to our attention. The boxes will be green and then it goes to amber, which means you've got a minute to wrap up, and then the red light goes on and the buzzer. So we regret it has to be that way, but we'll do the best we can to get all the evidence in. I see Nancy has arrived. Would you like to introduce your former Chairman? Mrs. Pelosi. It would be an honor. Mr. Regula. Okay. I don't know whether to call you Chairman or former Congressman or lawyer. You have a selection of titles, Lou, but I like to call you best of all friend. That's the one I like. Mr. Stokes. And that's something that means a great deal to me, Mr. Chairman, the friendship that you and I share, and the friendship you shared also with my late brother, Carl, with whom you served in Ohio. Mr. Regula. That's right. Lou's brother Carl was the first African American mayor of a major city in the United States, he was mayor of Cleveland. I sat beside him in the State House of Representatives, and we became very good friends. In fact, he endorsed me. [Laughter.] And he's a Democrat in Canton District. So see, Steny, there's an opportunity for you. [Laughter.] Mr. Hoyer. You never can tell. Mr. Regula. I think, Nancy, you came close once. You were out there, weren't you, at that meeting? Mrs. Pelosi. Yes, Mr. Chairman, I remember it well. And so do you. [Laughter.] Mr. Regula. Okay, well, Mrs. Pelosi, will you introduce our first witness this morning? Mrs. Pelosi. Mr. Chairman, this is a very great honor, as I know that any one of my colleagues would attest to. As you indicated in your opening remarks, this is almost a family affair for all of us, for Steny, for Jesse, because when Lou comes to the Committee, he not only comes personally, but he brings a great tradition with him. You talked about Carl, and I have my connection, too, my brother, Thomas D'Alessandro was a very close friend of Carl. They were both mayors in that very difficult time in our country's history, both young mayors. And they had a very, very close personal bond. I always used to say to Lou when I came here, I one day would love to meet your mother, she has to be the greatest mom in the world to have produced two great sons. Now the courthouse is--is it this Saturday? Mr. Stokes. It was this past Sunday. Mrs. Pelosi. This past Sunday, it was dedicated in Ohio in honor of her in her name. So with all of that personal and political history, I'm pleased to welcome our former colleague, Lou Stokes, behind whom and under whose leadership it was a pleasure to serve here and in other committees in the Congress. Congressman served in the Congress for 30 years, my friends, for those younger people here who don't know, 30 years, 1969 to 1999. He spent many of those years as a member of this Subcommittee. He's currently senior counsel of the law firm Squire, Saunders and Dempsey, and is a member of the faculty of Case Western Reserve University, senior visiting scholar at the Mandel School of Applied Social Sciences. Congressman Stokes is also a member of the board of advisors for the Trust for America's Health, which brings him here today. He will describe what it is, so I won't take any time to do that. But Congressman Stokes and the Trust for America's Health have shown great leadership in the effort to improve our Nation's response to environmental health hazards. As Iwelcome him, I want to say that in welcoming Lou Stokes to this Committee, I am welcoming the best that America has to offer. Our chairman, Mr. Stokes. Mr. Hoyer. Mr. Chairman? Mr. Regula. Mr. Hoyer. Mr. Hoyer. Thank you. I want to join Nancy's remarks. Before you got here, Nancy, I indicated to our audience that I had the great privilege and honor of sitting next to Lou for many years as he served on this Committee. He and his brother and family have been giants on behalf of so many different issues. But clearly, every young African American child in America can have an extraordinary role model in Lou Stokes. As I sat next to him, as you know, Mr. Chairman, you didn't serve on this Committee, so you didn't have the privilege of seeing him, but whether it's the historically black colleges dealing with higher education, or it was in TRIO, or it was in primary and secondary education programs, or whether it was dealing with employees at NIH who were aspiring to be treated on the basis of their character, their talent and their contribution rather than the color of their skin, Lou Stokes has been and continues to be a giant on behalf of all Americans. I want to join Nancy in welcoming him to this Committee. His leadership was a powerful, it was a quiet leadership, a leadership of conscience and of character, not of bluster and power, which made it even more powerful because of that. And Lou, all of us who know you are honored to be your friend and honored to have served with you. I join Nancy and Ralph and Jesse in welcoming you to the Committee. Mr. Regula. Mr. Jackson. Mr. Jackson. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. Let me just say that we run the danger this morning with all of the accolades that we could bestow upon Mr. Stokes, of the kind things that all of us who have had the opportunity to work with him, who have witnessed him from afar, and those of us who for the very brief tenures that we've been in the institution have had the great opportunity and privilege of working with Mr. Stokes, we run the danger this morning of our accolades being much longer than your testimony. [Laughter.] When I first came to this Committee, I came really as the successor to Lou Stokes. Many of the programs that I champion and argue for on this Committee were programs that Lou Stokes one, authored as a member of this institution, shepherded the legislation through the process, and then, on this Committee, fought to make sure that those programs were fully funded. The outstanding work that his family has done, his brother as mayor of Cleveland, the Congressman himself here in the United States institution, there are very few people who have earned the respect of both sides of the aisle like Congressman Lou Stokes. I remember when he announced his retirement, and many of us went to the Floor essentially to say goodbye to Mr. Stokes, the outpouring from both sides of the aisle was nothing less than astounding. I've seen other members of Congress who served the same amount of time in the institution, and literally within 15 or 20 minutes, whatever accolades were being bestowed upon them, essentially the special order was essentially over. We could have spent the entire day, maybe even the entire week, talking about the contributions that Lou Stokes has made to this Nation. I'm indeed honored that you're before our Committee, and I'm equally as honored to have the great privilege of trying my very best to follow in my footsteps on the Committee. I'm very grateful, Mr. Stokes. Mr. Stokes. Thank you. Mrs. Pelosi. This isn't about Mr. Stokes' contribution to this Committee, but it's important to note that he was the chair of the Ethics Committee, he was the chair of the Intelligence Committee, and all that that implies in terms of the changes. As the Ranking on Intelligence now, I can speak to all that he has done to, as far as diversity is concerned in that community as well. He has pioneered so many fronts, he's the all American boy. We could again take all day to talk about him. Mr. Jackson. I believe he was also lead investigator on the assassination of Martin Luther King, Jr., lead investigator on the assassination of John F. Kennedy, as well. So for those of you who are here, it's really a great privilege and a great honor for those are here and are very unfamiliar with our Committee to be in the presence of Mr. Stokes. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. Mr. Regula. Well, it's not only that, you go to Cleveland, every other street is a Stokes Boulevard. [Laughter.] And the Stokes VA clinic, and I don't know, is there anything left to name up there? Between you and Carl and your mother, I guess you skipped the Terminal Tower. But you've done well. Lou, we're happy to welcome you. Mr. Stokes. Mr. Chairman and Mr. Hoyer, Mrs. Pelosi and Mr. Jackson, I'm indeed overwhelmed. Mr. Regula. And we have a new member down here, Mr. Sherwood. Mr. Stokes. Mr. Sherwood. Mr. Regula. He's the newest member of our Subcommittee. Mr. Stokes. Greetings, Mr. Sherwood. Obviously I'm overwhelmed, your kindness and your kind remarks this morning have indeed overwhelmed me. It's difficult to even say to you what it meant to walk back into this room where I spent 24 of the 30 years that I served on the Appropriations Committee. It is a part of my life, and I suppose will always remain a part of my life, as will the personal friendships I had with each one of you. We've spoken, Mr. Chairman, of the great friendship you had, not only with me but with my brother, Carl, with whom you served. And Mr. Hoyer, I remember even you were out in Ohio when my daughter was running for judgeship out there, and you shared that experience with us. She's still on the bench, and enjoying it, thanks to you and others. Mrs. Pelosi, as you mentioned, your brother and my brother were mayors at the same time, and they were great friends. You enjoyed a special relationship also with my brother Carl. And Mr. Jackson, in your case, your father, Rev. Jesse Jackson, was highly instrumental when Dr. King came to Cleveland and walked the streets of Cleveland, to register voters in a way that they were able to elect Carl Stokes as mayor of Cleveland and set history. Your father was one of the young lieutenants that Dr. King brought with him. And your father over the years was a part of everything that Carl and I did in that city. It was a great honor for me to counsel with you about the fact that when I was leaving here, that this would be a great subcommittee for you to get on. I hear such wonderful things about what you're doing in terms of carrying on the work that I endeavored to do over the years. Mr. Chairman, I'm indeed honored to be here this morning. Mr. Chairman and members of the subcommittee, I'm currently serving on the board of a new public health organization called the Trust for America's Health. A former chairman of this Committee, John Porter, and Governor Lowell Weicker are also on this board. The Trust's mission is to put prevention back into the fight against chronic diseases. I serve on the Pew Environmental and Health Commission, located at Johns Hopkins Hospital. Based on the Commission's recommendation, the Trust's first initiative is to fight for the creation of a nationwide health tracking network to track chronic diseases. Today, chronic diseases such as cancer, asthma, leukemia, birth defects and Parkinsons kill four out of five Americans. More than a third of our population, 100 million women, children and men suffer from chronic diseases. These diseases annually cost our country $325 billion. Yet there is no national system to track these killer diseases. Our Federal and State agencies only coordinate tracking infectious diseases: polio, typhoid and yellow fever, diseases that a national tracking system helped to eradicate. Chairman Regula, let me give you some examples from our home State of Ohio. Even though asthma attacks are the number one cause of school absenteeism, and asthma has increased 75 percent between 1980 and 1994, Ohio does not track this disease. Ohio does not track cerebral palsy, autism and mental retardation, even though the National Academy of Sciences estimates that 25 percent of these diseases in children are caused by environmental factors. Although birth defects are the leading cause of infant mortality, Ohio does not have a birth defects registry. Even though multiple sclerosis has increased by about 20 percent between 1986 and 1995, Ohio does not track this disease. And unfortunately, Ohio is not unusual, it is the norm. To fill this void, the Pew Commission proposed a nationwide health tracking network. The network involves three basic features. The first feature establishes and coordinates local, State, and Federal health agencies to collect vital data. This data becomes part of a national system to track and monitor priority chronic diseases and potentially related environmental factors. The second is an early warning system that would identify environmental health threats in their earliest stages and give public health officials valuable data about health risks, such as lead poisoning. This network would be similar to the existing system that informs communities about infectious disease outbreaks. The final piece consists of enhancing and coordinating local, State and Federal health officials into rapid response teams to quickly investigate clusters and outbreaks. The response system would include regional programs to investigate local health problems and centers at our universities to assist with research and data analysis. The network would provide our doctors and hospitals, public health officials and communities, with data on patterns and possible environmental factors to enable them to form preventive strategies. Currently, chronic diseases cost our country $325 billion annually and are expected to reach $1 trillion in 15 years. These medical costs could be reduced significantly if we had data to prevent the onset of these diseases. The network has estimated the cost at about $275 million, or less than $1 for every man, woman and child in America. This investment is necessary now to stem the crushing medical costs to our country. This subcommittee and the Administration have rightfully doubled the investment in NIH. But we need to fund a network to give our NIH scientists the data they need. As a Nation, we can track birds and people with West Nile virus and the ebola virus on another continent. But we still can't track asthma. In the fiscal year 2001 budget, this subcommittee asked the CDC to research developing a network and expects the CDC to present the findings during this year. Now I am asking this subcommittee to finish what you have already begun. Please make the investment in this basic public health tracking tool. Only with your help can we pull our health tracking system into the 21st century and win the war against chronic diseases that cause so much human suffering. I thank you for the privilege of testifying. [The information follows:] [GRAPHIC(S) NOT AVAILABLE IN TIFF FORMAT] Mr. Regula. Thank you. Lou, where would you think we should put this kind of a record keeping, data collecting, in NIH or CDC or HHS? Mr. Stokes. I would think probably, Mr. Chairman, that CDC ought to be the appropriate agency here. And as I said, in the 2001 budget, the subcommittee asked CDC to look into this matter and report back to the subcommittee. I would think that they would probably be the correct one, the Centers for Disease Control. Mr. Regula. Right. Questions? Mrs. Pelosi. Mrs. Pelosi. Just a comment, Mr. Chairman. I thank--it's music to our ears to hear the maestro sing this song. Because this is such an important issue and you've worked on it so many years, Mr. Stokes. I just want to call the Chairman's attention, this subject came up, whether it was yesterday or the day before, when we were talking about the Sugar Law Guild Center, where they talked about tracking, and especially in minority communities, which are disproportionately affected by some of this, and the tracking will give us the data to verify that. But again, this was the only hearing that we had in this Committee, was on this subject, environmental health, and the issue of tracking was very, very important in that, the asthma, and how it affects children especially, is really a responsibility we have to get to the bottom of. So there's a connection to all of this. The non-profit community is playing a very major role, and with the prestige of Mr. Stokes, I'm sure we're going to find an answer to this. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. Thank you, Mr. Stokes. Mr. Stokes. Thank you very much. Mr. Regula. I checked with the staff, of course, as you know, the bill didn't get finished until December, early December or late November. Anyway, we don't have a report back yet, but we anticipate that coming this year, the response to the Committee's action. Mr. Stokes. Good. Mr. Regula. Any other questions? If not, thank you, Lou. We're happy to welcome you back here. Mr. Stokes. Thank you so much. Mr. Regula. It's a great idea. ---------- Thursday, March 22, 2001. SAFER FOUNDATION WITNESS DIANE WILLIAMS, PRESIDENT AND CEO, SAFER FOUNDATION Mr. Regula. We'll move on. Next, Mr. Jackson will introduce Diane Williams. Mr. Jackson. Mr. Chairman, as President of the Safer Foundation, a position she has held for four years, Diane Williams heads the Nation's leading non-profit provider of social services, education and job opportunities, exclusively targeting ex-offenders. Ms. Williams' association with Safer began in the 1970s as a volunteer, then serving on the agency's board of directors and as the vice president for development and strategic initiatives. Before she began her tenure at Safer, Ms. Williams was marketing director for the enhanced business unit at Ameritech, and she has held executive positions at AT&T and Rockwell International. Ms. Williams is an accomplished speaker in the areas of criminal justice policy, community corrections strategy, as well as prevention and basic education programming for adult and juvenile ex-offenders. She has been profiled in the Chicago Tribune, Chicago Sun Times, and her televised appearances include talk shows aired on CBS, NBC and WGN. In 1994, Diane was named the best and brightest among business executives by Dollars and Sense Magazine. Ms. Williams earned an MBA from Northwestern University and serves as an adjunct professor in marketing at Aurora College. Mr. Chairman and members of the Subcommittee, I present Ms. Diane Williams. Ms. Williams. Thank you, Congressman Jackson and Mr. Chairman, for allowing me to present the Safer Foundation to you today. You heard a long list of things that I've done, and this that I do today and throughout my time at the Safer Foundation is the most important work that I've done in my career. So you scare me to death when I come here and present this subject today. The Safer Foundation is a not-for-profit organization that works to reduce recidivism by supporting the efforts of former offenders to become productive, law-abiding members of their communities. We provide a full spectrum of services, including education, employment and case management. Established in 1972, with facilities in Chicago, Rock Island, Illinois and Davenport, Iowa, Safer has placed clients in over 40,000 jobs and is the largest community based provider of employment services for ex-offenders in this country. The Nation's prison population you know is on the rise. Over 600,000 men, women and youth are released from institutions each year. When ex-offenders come out of the correction system, they often have a variety of needs, as does the community have a variety of needs around helping them to re-integrate into society. All too often, many ex-offenders do not secure permanent, unsubsidized employment, because they lack occupational skills, have little or no job hunting experience, or find that many employers refuse to hire those with criminal records. Without a strong support system in place, all too often ex-offenders fall back into the criminal subculture. They do what they know how to do best. The re-entry partnerships initiative begun in 1999 is a Federal demonstration that assists eight States in confronting the challenges presented by the return of offenders from prison to the community. Funded through the Department of Justice, the Department of Labor and the Department of Health and Human Services, re-entry partnerships include identification of the appropriate re-entry offender population, surveillance and monitoring, community based support resources, and coordination between the criminal justice system and the employment, social services and treatment systems. The Safer Foundation respectfully requests that the subcommittee continue to support and to expand this important initiative. Safer is also committed to bridging the gaps that preclude the ex-offender population from successfully living in the community. We do that by providing, as we said, employment services geared to make successful job placements. We have employment specialists who work with our clients to complete job applications, to train them on how to behave inthe interview process, but even more importantly, to train them on how to behave in the job once achieved, so that they might not only be placed in employment, but retain that employment for a long, successful period of time. We have focused lots of our efforts on what we call a lifeguard position, which supports that client around those issues that arise while working sometimes or often for the first time when you're working, how you interact with your supervisor, how to work with other people and how to keep up your commitment as a team member in that work environment. The one on one relationship provided by our job developers is critical as we transition or assist to transition people into the mainstream. In addition to offering job training and placement, Safer also offers education programs. Current research indicates that the more education an offender has, the less likely they are to return to prison. Our youth empowerment program is one of Safer's most effective education programs, both in terms of helping clients earn their GEDs and also in reducing recidivism. Sixteen to 21 year olds are referred by probation and parole officers, or word of mouth, and are placed in this program which is designed to help students continue their education and training after Safer. Rather than provide traditional classroom instruction, which we know has been a failure for the clients that we serve, we offer an approach that's considered peer tutoring, or in today's more appropriate terminology, cooperative education. We started it before there was such a term as cooperative education. In addition to learning basic skills to prepare for taking the GED, these youthful ex-offenders learn problem solving skills that are needed to succeed in the world of work and community, increase their level of confidence in their ability to learn and to make and sustain constructive life changes. Of the over 300 students that have participated in our youth empowerment program, 81 percent complete the program. And their academic progress increased 12.5 percent from pre to post GED readiness. This is the equivalent of three grade levels in an eight week period of time. Of the students who finish the program, 50 percent passed the GED exam the first time they took it, a pass rate well above the State average, and actually the norm that the country averages. Nearly 200 of the students who completed the training were placed in either higher education, vocational training or jobs, and 95 percent completed at least 30 days retention in their placements. Perhaps most significantly, our three year recidivism rate for the youth empowerment program is only 21.4 percent, less than half of the Illinois juvenile rate of 51 percent for the same period. We are in the process of building a program on the south side of Chicago because three out of the four students that apply for our program today are denied access to the program. We are asking your support in continuing that project that Congressman Jackson was very instrumental in helping us to start this year. Thank you. [The information follows:] [GRAPHIC(S) NOT AVAILABLE IN TIFF FORMAT] Mr. Regula. Thank you. How far out do you reach? Do you go beyond Illinois? Ms. Williams. We've gone into Illinois and Iowa, have not gone beyond those two States today. It is interesting that you ask that question, Mr. Chairman, because a number of other folks are asking us about coming to States where they serve. Mr. Regula. I think I heard you say that among juveniles, the recidivism rate is 51 percent? Ms. Williams. In the State of Illinois, for the 16 to 21 year old age group, that's correct. Mr. Regula. I suspect it's even higher--I was on the Ohio Crime Commission, and at that time it was 75 percent in the adult population. That's tragic. Ms. Williams. It is tragic. On the adult side, we have in Illinois, it's almost 50 percent. Our recidivism rate for the adult population that we serve is 17 percent. So we do help people. Mr. Regula. The ones you serve are at 17 percent? Ms. Williams. That's correct. Mr. Regula. Those that are outside the system, it's probably much higher. Ms. Williams. That's correct. Mr. Regula. Any other questions? Yes, Mr. Kennedy. Mr. Kennedy. Yes, Mr. Chairman, I want to commend the good work that's being done, just say, we have a permanent prison class in this country right now, 2 million people in jail. These people are going to have to come out. And the thought that we as a Nation have not come to grips with what that's going to mean, I mean, these are people with a record. They're going to be living in our society, trying to get jobs, trying to get re-integrated. I mean, we're going to pay the price as a Nation if we don't come up with a better solution than we have now for helping them re-integrated into the community. And every one of those people that you're saving is also, I would venture to say, many families who might otherwise be victimized by this person that you're saving, a lot of heartache and grief. So I think you're doing more than our own criminal justice system is doing to help keep our communities safer. And I want to thank you for the good work you're doing. Ms. Williams. Thank you very much. Mr. Regula. Thank you. ---------- Thursday, March 22, 2001. MARYLAND STATE DEPARTMENT OF EDUCATION WITNESS NANCY S. GRASMICK, MARYLAND STATE SUPERINTENDENT OF SCHOOLS, MARYLAND STATE DEPARTMENT OF EDUCATION Mr. Regula. Our next witness, Mr. Hoyer will introduce Dr. Nancy Grasmick. Mr. Hoyer. Thank you very much, Mr. Chairman. While Dr. Grasmick is coming forward, I'll start to introduce her. Dr. Grasmick has been superintendent of schools in Maryland since 1991, for over a decade. Nancy, are you the longest serving superintendent in the United States now? Ms. Grasmick. There's one other that's longer. Mr. Hoyer. Dr. Grasmick is a graduate of Johns Hopkins University, Towson and of Gallaudet. So she has a very broad background and a lot of ways to communicate with people, and does so extraordinarily well on behalf of children and on behalf of families. I'm not objective when it comes to Dr. Grasmick, I must say, because Judy, my wife Judy and Nancy were at Towson together, and graduated together and worked together throughout their professional careers and frankly, until Judy died. Dr. Grasmick has received too many awards, Mr. Chairman, for me to articulate. But if you read her resume, she has been cited as one of Maryland's most outstanding leaders, one of the Nation's most outstanding educators, has been cited, as I say, both by National and State organizations for her work and leadership in education. She has been the superintendent, which is, by the way, selected by our board, under two governors. She is the only person that I know of that was the secretary of two departments at the same time in the State of Maryland. She was with Juvenile Family--what was the name of it, Nancy? Ms. Grasmick. The Office for Children, Youth and Families. Mr. Hoyer. The Office of Children, Youth and Families, which we have a similar one, as well as the superintendent of schools, an extraordinarily accomplishment. She has been recognized by her peers throughout the Nation as somebody who has brought a commitment to quality education and to accountability, which is being discussed, properly so, so widely. So I'm pleased on behalf of all the Committee to welcome Dr. Grasmick to our Committee, and look forward to her testimony. Ms. Grasmick. Thank you. Thank you, Mr. Hoyer. It's really an honor to be here and testify before you, Mr. Chairman, and members of the Committee. It is also an honor to perpetuate the vision of an extraordinary woman, Judy Hoyer, who was such a champion and pioneer for young children in the State of Maryland. In her honor, and because of her incredible work, we have created in the State of Maryland a concept known as the Judy Center. As you begin your work on the fiscal year 2002 budget, I'm asking that you give consideration to nationally replicating this incredible collaborative full service program for all of America's young children. What is a Judy Center? It is a comprehensive early childhood education program, which is coupled with family support services for children birth through six years of age and their families. It is either located in a public school or located in a facility in close proximity to an elementary school. Currently in the State of Maryland, our Judy Centers are serving over 4,400 of these young children. Over the years, Government has been dedicated to generating program after program, wonderful programs, for young children and their families. However, these programs have been generated in a piece-meal fashion where they are scattered across communities, where space is sometimes the primary consideration of where they will be located. Often citizens do not know of the existence of these services and they don't have the capability to access them. Imagine needing three or four different services for your child, but you don't have transportation to even get to one service. It can be a daunting task, and sometimes the conclusion is, it's easier not to participate than to try to figure out how to access these services. This is the wonderful part of the Judy Centers. We take the best part of Government, all of the helpful services being generated, and make them accessible to families. This is cost effective, it provides services to our citizens, but in addition to that, it provides for cost avoidance. In the State of Maryland, we are spending more than $328 million a year of State and Federal funding to help children catch up as they matriculate through their school career. We're all aware of the current brain research talking about the potential for learning that young children have. In Maryland, we've created a kindergarten work sampling system, and we have concluded that 40 percent of the children entering kindergarten in the State of Maryland are not ready to learn as we've defined it as a national goal. These Judy Centers offer full day, full year services, including kindergarten, pre- kindergarten, therapeutic nurseries, special education services, infant and toddler programs, before and after school child care, Head Start, Family Support Centers, Healthy Families, parent involvement programs, community health programs. It builds a continuum of education and support services from birth through school entry. Thirteen of our 24 jurisdictions in the State of Maryland currently have Judy Centers. We anticipate the expansion very soon. Why do these centers work? In addition to the reasons I've already cited, they are results oriented, strong accountability for outcomes, program accreditation is a requirement for all of the programs contained in these centers. Family support services are required. Project coordination and case management services are essential. Finally, it brings together a whole community of professionals. And I would say that all of us in this room know that education is the bridge to opportunity. The Judy Centers help young children and their families take those first steps on that bridge. Thank you. [The information follows:] [GRAPHIC(S) NOT AVAILABLE IN TIFF FORMAT] Mr. Regula. Thank you. That's a wonderful legacy for Judy Hoyer. A couple of questions. Can you use Title I or do you use Head Start money to finance these? How do you handle that? Ms. Grasmick. We cobble together a lot of the dollars that we receive. Yes, we do use Head Start monies for a portion of this, and yes, we do use some of our Title I funding for a portion of this. Certainly we do that. But it's all of the collateral services that make these so special that often are not funded. Mr. Regula. Do you use volunteers at all, medical personnel or consultants? Ms. Grasmick. We have medical personnel, we have the presence of higher education in terms of doing professional development for the individuals who work in these centers. So there's a K-16 relationship, as well as social workers, health professionals, etc. Mr. Regula. Another aside. Do you do testing in the Maryland system? Ms. Grasmick. We certainly do, throughout the school career of children. I'm proud to say in quality counts, which is the national assessment of all 50 States, Maryland was rated number one with a score of 98 for its assessment accountability and standards. Mr. Regula. Questions? Mr. Hoyer. She's terrific, isn't she? [Laughter.] Obviously I'm not very subjective on this issue, Mr. Chairman, I admit to that. But I know those of my colleagues who have served on this Committee for some time, Nita Lowey and I particularly, talking about comprehensive schools, and in Dr. Grasmick's testimony, this is not necessarily a program that costs more money. What it seeks to do, we have at the Federal and State levels a lot of programs that all of us have sponsored or supported, that have a multiplicity of parents who are all very proud of those programs. The problem that Judy had and that others have at the local level is looking sort of at this array of programs that are designed to help Mary Jane or Johnny Brown. But the complexity of getting from HHS, Department of Education, Department of Transportation, Department of Agriculture, HUD and other agencies who have resources available to help children learn better and to help their families be more functional and therefore have the family unit and the child ready to learn and learning well, is a challenge. I will be introducing in the next couple of weeks the Full Service Community Schools Act of 2001. I put $500,000 in this bill about five years ago, for the purposes of having a study done by HHS and the Department of Education on how to better do this. They came out with a report, we didn't implement it as quickly as we could. The Governor and Judy, the present Governor, who was then county executive of Prince George's County, and Governor Schaffer, then our Governor, very close to Dr. Grasmick, and Judy put together a similar center in Prince George's County, Mr. Chairman, and that has served as the model for this program that Dr. Grasmick and Governor Glendenning put together. In fact, it was Governor Glendenning's suggestion to name these the Judy Centers, which he thought was much more family friendly than the actual title of the bill, which was the Judith B. Hoyer Early Child Care and Education Act. But Dr. Grasmick, I want to thank you so very much for the leadership and commitment that you have shown in making sure not just that this program works, but that we are effectively reaching out to every child, and that like President Bush says, we cannot afford to leave a child behind. Thank you for being here, and thank you for your leadership. Ms. Grasmick. Thank you, Congressman. Mr. Regula. Mrs. Pelosi. Mrs. Pelosi. Mr. Chairman, I know usually you don't want us to have too many comments, but very briefly, I want to join Congressman Hoyer in welcoming Dr. Grasmick. Her reputation in Maryland is well established for a long time. As Steny pointed out in his opening remarks, her qualifications are exquisite. But I just want to thank you for this model, which as anyone who knew and loved Judy would know how much this means to her. I want to thank you and Mr. Hoyer for your leadership on this. Your successful implementation of it serves as a model to the rest of the country. For that we're all grateful. Thank you. Ms. Grasmick. Thank you. Mr. Regula. Thank you for being here. We have a motion to adjourn on the Floor. If everybody could go over and get back quickly. I think Mr. Jackson--Mr. Peterson will do one other one until you get back and introduce your witness. I think, Mr. Hoyer, you have some, too. Mr. Hoyer. I'll go vote. Mr. Regula. So we will do one, then we'll go to yours, Mr. Jackson. ---------- Thursday, March 22, 2001. MINORITY HEALTH PROFESSIONS SCHOOLS WITNESS RONNY B. LANCASTER, MBA, J.D., PRESIDENT, ASSOCIATION OF MINORITY HEALTH PROFESSIONS SCHOOLS Mr. Regula. Okay, we'll get started. Mr. Jackson, if you'd like to introduce your guest today, Mr. Ronny Lancaster. Mr. Jackson. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. Mr. Chairman, thank you for the opportunity to introduce Ronny Lancaster. Mr. Lancaster is the Senior Vice President for Management and Policy at the Morehouse School of Medicine, and the President of the Association of Minority Health Professions Schools. Mr. Chairman, the Association of Minority Health Professions Schools is comprised of the Nation's 12 historically black medical, dental, pharmacy and veterinary schools. Combined, these institutions have graduated 50 percent of all African American physicians and dentists, 60 percent of all African American pharmacists, and 75 percent of all African American veterinarians. Mr. Chairman, working closely with the Association in the 106th Congress, we were successful in passing legislation establishing the National Center for Minority Health and Health Disparities at the NIH. Following the passage of this legislation, this subcommittee included a line item appropriation of $130 million in fiscal year 2001. Mr. Chairman, members of the subcommittee, I want to thank Mr. Lancaster and the Association of Minority Health Professions Schools for their commitment to improving the health status of all Americans, and I look forward to working with Mr. Lancaster. Mr. Lancaster, welcome to the subcommittee. Mr. Lancaster. Thank you, Mr. Jackson. Thank you, Mr. Chairman, and good morning to you and members of the subcommittee and to Mr. Jackson. Mr. Chairman, it's an honor to appear before the subcommittee this morning, and thank you for the opportunity. It is an honor to be introduced by any member of Congress, and a privilege to be introduced by Congressman Jackson, a member not only of this subcommittee, but a member who has distinguished himself in that in just a second term he has successfully sponsored legislation which leads to the improvement of lives for millions of Americans in our association and the Nation. We owe Mr. Jackson and his colleagues a debt of gratitude for their hard work, their vision and their commitment in accomplishing this most important objective. Our association also welcomes you, Mr. Chairman, and we look forward to a long association during your tenure as Chair. We ask that the record reflect our deep appreciation to Chairman John Porter who led this subcommittee with distinction. Mr. Chairman, before beginning my formal testimony, I'd like the opportunity, very briefly, to introduce the gentleman to my left, your right. This is Dr. John E. Maupin, President of Meharry Medical College. It will be my privilege to hand over the gavel as president of this association to Dr. Maupin in about two weeks. Mr. Chairman, you may know, and interestingly, Mrs. Pelosi mentioned in introducing Mr. Stokes, she referred simply to difficult days in our Nation's history. We, I think, all recognize that our history has been punctuated by glorious moments, and yet simultaneously, unfortunately, there have been difficult times. Meharry Medical College stands alone with Howard University School of Medicine as only two universities in this Nation where for almost eight decades, these were the only medical schools in the country where African American and other students were allowed to go for medical education. So it is a privilege to introduce Dr. Maupin, and again a privilege to hand the gavel to him. Mr. Chairman, I'm here this morning to ask the support of the subcommittee for three areas. These include support for the continuation of the doubling effort for the National Institutes of Health, support for the Title III program which is administered by the U.S. Department of Education, and finally, support for a group of programs administered by the Health Resources and Services Administration, HRSA, collectively referred to as Health Professions Programs. To go through these, just a word about each of these quickly, Mr. Chairman. Support for the doubling of the appropriation to support the National Institutes of Health is nearly universal. We add our voice to that chorus. The National Institutes of Health has done a magnificent job in leading the world in scientific inquiry and discovery, leading in turn to the improved health status of many Americans. Regrettably, despite the success, NIH has not done as good a job focusing on the important subject of minority health and health disparities. Now, thanks to the leadership of Mr. Jackson and Congressman Charlie Norwood, and the strong support of Republican and Democratic leaders in both chambers, we now have at NIH a new national center for minority health and health disparities charged with examining these very important issues. So we support a 16 percent increase for NIH and request also a funding level of $200 million for this new center, to enable it to conduct the important work for which it has been charged. Secondly, Mr. Chairman, with respect to the Title III program, this program is authorized by Title III of the Higher Education Act, commonly referred to as Title III, and its purpose simply is to strengthen historically black graduate institutions by establishing and strengthening program development offices, helping to initiate endowment campaigns at those institutions, strengthening information technology programs and finally, strengthening their library capacity. And finally, Mr. Chairman, I will say also, we are very appreciative to this subcommittee for their very strong support of this program last year, and we request support again in this program at the level of $60 million. Finally, in the area of health professions, we ask your support for the group of programs collectively referred to as Health Professions, programs such as the Health Careers Opportunities Program, HCOP, which encourages minority and underprivileged youth to consider careers in health professions, another program, Scholarships for Disadvantaged Students, which makes it possible for these students, frankly, to receive an education. And finally, Centers of Excellence programs, which seeks to support a level of excellence at each of our institutions. These programs, Mr. Chairman, collectively, without exaggeration, are the difference at our institutions between the doors being open and closed. So in closing, Mr. Chairman, once again I'd like to thank Mr. Porter for his leadership in the past. I'd like to thank Mr. Jackson for the privilege of introducing me this morning. And finally, thank you, Mr. Chairman, for the privilege of appearing this morning. Welcome, and we look forward to working with you during your tenure. [The information follows:] [GRAPHIC(S) NOT AVAILABLE IN TIFF FORMAT] Mr. Regula. Thank you. How many institutions do you represent? Mr. Lancaster. There are nine institutions, Mr. Chairman, with twelve graduate programs at these nine institutions. These institutions are located throughout the country. Mr. Regula. Are these exclusively African Americans, or do you have a mixture of student body? Mr. Lancaster. They all have a history in the African American tradition, that is to say, they are HBCUs. But, it's really important to emphasize that each of our institutions admit a wide range of students. My institution, for example, the Morehouse School of Medicine, 80 percent are African American students, approximately 10 percent are Hispanic and 10 percent are white. Mr. Regula. Okay, thank you. Mr. Jackson, questions? Thank you for coming. Mr. Lancaster. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. ---------- Thursday, March 22, 2001. SOCIETY FOR INVESTIGATIVE DERMATOLOGY WITNESSES LUIS A. DIAZ, M.D., PRESIDENT, THE SOCIETY FOR INVESTIGATIVE DERMATOLOGY; CHAIRMAN, DEPARTMENT OF DERMATOLOGY, UNIVERSITY OF NORTH CAROLINA AT CHAPEL HILL DANIELLE CURTIS DAVID ZARET Mr. Regula. Next is Dr. Luis Diaz, The Society for Investigative Dermatology and Chairman of the Department of Dermatology, University of North Carolina, and accompanied by Danielle Curtis and David Zaret. Dr. Diaz. Thank you, Mr. Chairman, subcommittee members. On behalf of the Society for Investigative Dermatology, the thousands of patients with skin diseases and myself, I wish to thank you, Mr. Chairman, for this opportunity to testify before your Committee. I am Luis Diaz, President of the Society for Investigative Dermatology, a dermatologist dedicated to patient care, skin research and training of dermatologists and scientists. I work at the University of North Carolina. On my left is Danielle Curtis, a patient suffering with vertiligo, an autoimmune disease in which the immune system destroys the pigment of the cells. On my right is Mr. David Zaret, a patient suffering from a disease named anthivulgaris, an autoimmune disease in which the immune system destroys the skin on the lining of the oral cavity. These diseases were lethal until the decade of the 1950s. Complications of treatment of these diseases are serious. You can imagine the problems that Danielle and David are suffering every day of their lives. The mission of the Society for Investigative Dermatology is to support research in skin diseases, and to facilitate the training of physicians and scientists of the future. We believe that scientific research on skin diseases is the best approach to bring hope and assistance to millions of Americans of all ages, gender and ethnicity that are currently suffering from these ailments. Through research, we wish to enhance our knowledge in prevention, diagnosis and treatment of skin diseases. We have four suggestions which are also advocated by the American Academy of Dermatology, representing all U.S. dermatologists, and the Coalition of Patient Advocates for Skin Disease Research, which is composed of 24 organizations concerned with skin diseases. One, our Society is deeply grateful to the members of this Committee for our efforts to double the funding of NIH over five years. We support the proposal of the Ad Hoc Group for Medical Research Funding, which calls for a 16.5 percent increase in funding for NIH in fiscal year 2002 and specifically for the National Institute of Arthritis, Musculoskeletal and Skin Diseases, NIAMS. Last year, Congress passed and the President signed a bill which included a major section regarding clinical research and loan repayment provisions for young trainees interested in biomedical research. The pool of physician scientists is decreasing at an alarming rate in all fields of medicine, and in dermatology. We request that this Committee provide the appropriate level of funding for this new, important legislative initiative. You would be surprised, Mr. Chairman, the information regarding total cost to society of a skin disease is not updated since 1979. Information about incidence, prevalence, mortality and disability, along with the economic cost is unavailable. Also unavailable is information about loss of economic productivity and activities that are foregone as a result of disease. A number of Federal agencies collect information about these matters. We believe a workshop developed under the auspices of the NIAMS and including representatives of all various agencies to identify existing information sources on the causes and scope of skin diseases, and to recommend strategies to developing new information sources would be very valuable. Such a workshop would be useful to NIAMS for its own planning purposes, it would be useful to the field of dermatology for its use in planning for future research, manpower and service needs. And it would be very helpful to the volunteer organizations in informing their constituencies on patients, for raising funds from the public for research. If the committee is interested, we would be pleased to work with your staff regarding bill report language in that regard. Thank you very much for giving me the opportunity. I am pleased to answer any questions you may have, Mr. Chairman. [The information follows:] [GRAPHIC(S) NOT AVAILABLE IN TIFF FORMAT] Mr. Regula. Thank you. Any questions? Thank you for coming. I see you're headquartered in Cleveland, is that right? Or the Society is. Dr. Diaz. In Cleveland, yes. Mr. Regula. How many members do you have nationwide? Dr. Diaz. Three thousand. Mr. Regula. Mostly physicians that treat? Dr. Diaz. Physicians and scientists working in research in dermatology. Mr. Regula. So you get help from NIH? Dr. Diaz. We get help from NIH, yes. Mr. Regula. Okay. Thank you for coming. Dr. Diaz. Thank you very much, Mr. Chairman. ---------- Thursday, March 22, 2001. RETT SYNDROME ASSOCIATION WITNESSES KATHY HUNTER, FOUNDER AND PRESIDENT, INTERNATIONAL RETT SYNDROME ASSOCIATION CHERYL DUNIGAN Mr. Regula. Next, Mr. Hoyer will introduce Kathy Hunter. Mr. Hoyer. Thank you very much, Mr. Chairman. I also understand she's joined by Dr. Dunigan. Mr. Chairman, some years ago, Kathy, when did we do this, 1985? Ms. Hunter. In 1986. Mr. Hoyer. In 1986, I spoke with Chairman Natcher, and we had some testimony about a disease, an affliction that I had no knowledge of. But I knew a wonderful, and still know, a wonderful young woman named Christy. And she and I went to church together. She at that point in time, I presume, was about seven or eight years of age. For the first 18 months of her life, she developed normally, 16, 20 months, developed normally. And then for some unknown reason, her neurological development not only stopped, but it went back. And to this day, she has not progressed much beyond the age of a 14 or 15 month old. Her body has developed, obviously. She is still a good friend, and I see her in church from time to time, not as often as she used to come. She's a wonderful young woman. She was afflicted with what we now know is Rett Syndrome. It is a syndrome that affects young women at that age. The tragedy of course is that it afflicts a normally growing child that parents have related to for the first few months of life, thinking that their child was going to develop fully and normally. We put $500,000, we didn't earmark it, but we put in, we asked NIH to look at this. And both Johns Hopkins and Baylor undertook to look at this syndrome and have now developed, identified and we are making progress. Kathy Hunter has a child as well with Rett Syndrome, and founded an organization to spur research and development, and parents getting together and talking to one another and making it easier to cope and to understand and work on behalf of these afflicted young children. She has done an extraordinary job, as so many citizens who take unto themselves the personal responsibility to make a difference. She and her husband have made an extraordinary difference, and I am pleased to be her friend and to welcome her to this Committee. She is one of those advocates on behalf of health of her own child, but on behalf of thousands and thousands of other children and parents, and of our society. John Kennedy once said, in talking about some children with disabilities that although these children were the victims of fate, they would not be the victims of our neglect. And certainly, Kathy Hunter has not neglected these children. Thank you, Kathy, for all you've done. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. Ms. Hunter. We're so appreciative for your leadership and your advocacy and support and that of the Committee over the years. Julia Roberts has just become our national spokesperson, and we made a film that's now showing on Discovery Health. Mr. Hoyer. Kathy, if you could tell her that I would certainly be open to working closely with her as well---- [Laughter.] Mr. Hoyer. I love seeing you, I want you to know that, I don't want her as an alternative. But you could bring her to testify next time. Ms. Hunter. It would be very helpful to have a pretty woman, but we're also very happy to have your support. Mr. Hoyer. Thank you. Ms. Hunter. Thank you for this opportunity to convey the importance of increased funding to the National Institutes of Health to accelerate research on the cause, treatment and cure for neurological disorders. The International Rett Syndrome Association joins the biomedical community's efforts to double the NIH budget by fiscal year 2003 and stands by the request for a $3.4 billion increase for NIH in fiscal year 2002. The impact and burden of neurological diseases cannot be emphasized enough. As I have for the last 16 years, I come before this Committee to talk about the Rett Syndrome story. It's the tale of a unique and puzzling brain disorder which doesn't show its face until the child is about a year old, andhas achieved normal developmental milestones, and then a frightening mental and physical deterioration follows. Rett Syndrome robs its victims of the ability to walk, speak, and use their hands purposefully. It renders children incapable of performing the simplest acts of daily living without total assistance from others. Though rarely fatal, Rett Syndrome follows a tragic and irreversible course leaving its victims permanently impaired for life. Pearl Buck said, ``We learn as much from sorrow as from joy, as much from illness as from health, as much from handicap as from advantage and indeed, perhaps more.'' And this is true. Parents learn many good lessons in their journey with Rett Syndrome, but our children's suffering does not begin to balance the knowledge or insight gained from the terrible tragedy of Rett Syndrome. My daughter with Rett Syndrome is 27 years old. She's as tall as my heart. Think of what it would be like to realize that your child will never grow up like her brothers or sisters, and imagine what it's like to provide the kind of care and support required for an infant, but for a lifetime. But I'm not here to tell you just about the bad news about Rett Syndrome. I'm here to share some marvelous news, and that is that last year when I was here, I told you about the dedication and triumph that led to the miraculous discovery of the gene for Rett Syndrome. Located on the X chromosome, this gene produces part of a switch that shuts off the production of proteins. When these are not shut off when they should be, the protein over-production causes nervous system deterioration which you see in Rett Syndrome. This finding is the first incidence of a human disease caused by defects in a protein whose function it is to silence other genes. So in a way, Rett Syndrome is the little disease that could. The gene discovery will help us better understand the disease process in Rett Syndrome and will likely lead to treatments. Because brain development continues long after birth and symptoms of Rett Syndrome do not develop for several months, there's a window of opportunity during infancy in which we might be able to intervene to prevent further damage, something we never thought possible before. In fact, clinical trials based on the gene discovery are already underway. One of the most thrilling pieces of news is the recent development, just in the last two weeks, of two animal models which mimic Rett Syndrome. These mouse models will allow drug experimentation which may mitigate the damage or improve function, and will permit post-mortem studies at all stages of development. Even more exciting, researchers will be able to study the effects of the mutation in animals who have not yet developed clinical symptoms. These studies could answer many questions about the cascading effect of the mutation in the brain and throughout the body, both before and after birth. The understanding of these basic molecular changes greatly improves our understanding of finding prevention and treatment strategies. Studies of the mouse have already shown that the genetic defect is in effect not only during brain development before birth, but has a critical prolonged effect even after birth. Since it's easier to treat newborns than to correct defects in embryonic development, this gives us hope and promise for future treatments. Since the first time I came before this Committee, we have come such a long way. I told you, now I'm wearing reading glasses and I brought my grandchild with me. So back in 1986, when NIH funding began, it was a study of a rare and little understood disorder. It was a pretty risky venture. Work had to start at the beginning, because this was a disorder that had nothing more than a name. Before the gene discovery diagnosing Rett Syndrome before the age of four or five years was often difficult. Today, we have a new genetic test to improve the speed and accuracy of early diagnosis, and people don't have to wait like I did until my daughter was 10 years old, and also to screen prenatally in families who already have a child with Rett Syndrome. Another significant result is the discovery that Rett Syndrome is not limited to females, as previously thought. It's now known that while rare, males can have Rett Syndrome, they die before birth or shortly after birth. So the mutation could play a major role in non-specific mental retardation in both males and females. The finding of the MECP2 mutation appears also in people who do not have Rett Syndrome and this knowledge leads us to know that it's responsible for milder forms of mental retardation, and may account for a large number, about 65 percent of people who have mental retardation and have no known diagnosis for it. So this rare, little-known disorder that came to your attention some 16 years ago may have a profound effect that lasts far beyond Rett Syndrome. The biggest news in this story is not about Rett Syndrome, it's about those thousands and thousands of people who fall into that category, the 65 percent of unknown causes for mental retardation. So we urge you to increase funding that will bring about a better tomorrow and a brighter future for people with neurological disorders. Thank you. [The information follows:] [GRAPHIC(S) NOT AVAILABLE IN TIFF FORMAT] Mr. Hoyer. I want to again thank you. The bad news is that this syndrome exists. The good news is, as Kathy indicated, that we've had recently some extraordinary progress. I would say to my friend, Don Sherwood, and Patrick Kennedy, who are both spending their first few days on this Committee, it is an extraordinary opportunity to assist both individuals but more importantly, millions of people in the United States and around the world. Dr. Rett is from Switzerland, right? Ms. Hunter. Austria. Mr. Hoyer. Austria, excuse me. From Austria. He was the first medical doctor to identify this, but NIH grants to Hopkins and Baylor have been really the spur that has led to the discoveries. So it is a good news story as well that we are on the brink, hopefully, of possibly prevention and perhaps even amelioration. Thank you, Kathy. Doctor, thank you. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. Mr. Regula. Thank you. Thank you for coming. ---------- Thursday, March 22, 2001. AMERICAN ACADEMY OF FAMILY PHYSICIANS WITNESS JAMES C. MARTIN, M.D., BOARD MEMBER, AMERICAN ACADEMY OF FAMILY PHYSICIANS Mr. Regula. Next we have our colleague from San Antonio, Texas, Mr. Charles Gonzalez, who's going to introduce Dr. James Martin. Welcome, Mr. Gonzalez. Mr. Gonzalez. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. Good morning, Mr. Chairman, members of the Committee. It is a distinct pleasure, of course, to be introducing someone who will be testifying here this morning who is from San Antonio. It's Jim Martin, and as I said, he is from San Antonio, and he's here representing the American Academy of Family Physicians, AAFP. After 20 years of private practice, Dr. Martin now serves as program director for the Family Residency Program at Santa Rosa Health Care in San Antonio. He is also a clinical professor with the University of Texas Health Science Center in San Antonio. Dr. Martin has been a member of the AAFP since 1976, and currently serves on the board of directors. The AAFP represents more than 88,000, I believe it may be closer to, or surpasses now, 90,000 family physicians, family practice residents and medical students nationwide. Health profession training programs are vital in the effort to train more family doctors, especially in medically under- served communities, much like my district, San Antonio, Texas. What determines the effectiveness of a Congress is how well informed are its members. So to Dr. Martin and all other witnesses that will be testifying today, I commend them. And as a member of Congress, and even on behalf of this Committee, the important role that you play to inform us in making the decisions that better serve our constituents. And with that, it's a great pleasure to introduce Dr. Jim Martin of San Antonio. Dr. Martin. I would like to address three specific funding issues with you this morning. The first is family medicine training under Section 747 of the Public Health Safety Act. The second is the Agency for Health Care Research and Quality, and the third are the rural public health programs which you now sponsor. Before doing that, the Academy has asked me to thank this Subcommittee for its incredible support for these programs through the years. We especially appreciate your recognition last year of the need to enhance the program by additional funding in fiscal year 2001. The Academy now asks you to also provide appropriate support for Section 47 by $158 million, $96 million of which will go to family medicine training. That becomes very important to us, especially at a time when the Administration budget blueprint suggests that cuts should occur in these programs. The rationale of the cuts is based on the presupposition that there already are enough primary care family physicians, and that the market should be able to regulate the supply itself. The realities of health care in American would suggest otherwise, which I would like to state to you. First of all, there is a shortage of primary care and family physicians in America. The Institute of Medicine, the Council on Graduate Medical Education, and other entities have long advocated that we have a balanced physician work force, 50 percent primary care physicians, 50 percent subspecialists. By the most conservative number that I could find, America is short 20,000 family physicians. And the markets have not helped us here, in that the number of students interested in primary care specialties have decreased over the last four years, and we suspect in the national residence and matching program that will come out today that that trend will still continue, with a decreased interest on the part of medical students. There is good news. Your Title VII funds have been effective. The Graham Policy Center has shown very clearly that students who are in medical schools receiving Title VII funding are more likely to go into primary care, they're more likely to go into family medicine, they're more likely to practice in rural areas, and as Congressman Gonzalez said, they're more likely to practice in the primary care health profession shortage areas, or HPSAs, which I will shorten it to at this point. A very intriguing study by the Graham Policy Centerlooked at the HPSAs across the country. There are 3,000 counties in the United States, 800 of which now are primary care HPSAs. If we take the general internists, general pediatricians and the obstetrician gynecologists out of this mix, there become another 176 counties that are HPSA designated. If we remove the family physicians, that number goes to almost 1,500. The conclusion is that family physicians are responsible for the health care infrastructure of half of the counties in the United States, and we don't have enough of them. Very briefly, I would also ask you to continue to support the ARHQ programs. We have worked very carefully with them. We especially appreciate what ARHQ brings to the table in its research at the practice level. We also appreciate their commitment to addressing some of the quality and health safety issues that we now are all concerned about. For the second the Subcommittee recognized that the research that's being done here is taking the new discoveries of the NIH and other basic biomedical technology and translating that into how we take better care of our patients at the doctor patient level, and we think this is some important. And finally, I ask you also to continue to support the National Health Care Service, your State offices of rural health, for the work that they do. That concludes my remarks. I'd be happy to respond to any questions that you might have. [The information follows:] [GRAPHIC(S) NOT AVAILABLE IN TIFF FORMAT] Mr. Regula. I agree with you, there's a real shortage. But how do you overcome the fact that here comes a student with a huge debt for education, and obviously, the specialists have better earning power than the family practice. I don't know if we can address that simply by saying we want more members in family practice. Dr. Martin. Well, they are issues that need to be addressed. I think that there are individuals out there who want to be what family doctors and the primary care physicians do. I think it's important for the medical schools to go back and look at their admitting policies and try to identify those, what shall I say, more altruistic individuals who are willing to take on jobs where they are not paid as well, and where their work hours are much longer than some of their subspecialty colleagues. Mr. Regula. Do you think Medicare's reimbursement rates tilts this table a little bit? Dr. Martin. They're certainly not helpful, especially for those in the rural or the inner city areas, like Congressman Gonzalez has. Mr. Regula. Mr. Kennedy. Mr. Kennedy. On the Medicare reimbursement, though, for the residency it tilts it, clearly. The subsidies are enormous for specialties. We should like to get some specific recommendations from you in terms of what we can pass on to our colleagues, because the reimbursement for these residencies, we're all paying for that. The Medicare program is subsidizing these people getting a specialty. So that's all money that's taxpayer money that's going to help educate someone to get higher earning power, and if it's the need of this country to have primary care physicians, we ought to reverse that policy, especially given the fact there's a shortage of graduate medical education dollars. We ought to point it, if we do have a shortage, towards those primary care professions. Dr. Martin. May I respond to Mr. Kennedy? We agree very much that needs to be addressed. As I stated earlier, there needs to be a balance. Obviously, we need many subspecialists. But we also need an appropriate number of primary care, and specifically family physicians. I hope that the work force policies will really look at that graduate medical education funding, and make sure the funds go to where this country needs it. Mr. Hoyer. I just want to make an observation. You have an extraordinarily effective member of Congress who has presented you to this Committee. His dad was a giant, as you know, in this institution. I am struck by the fact that his personality is different from his father's, but his father was and he is extraordinarily effective and popular and respected in this institution. I'm sure you probably know that, but I wanted to reiterate. He does a great job. Mr. Gonzalez. Thank you, Steny. Mr. Regula. Thank you. Thank you for bringing the doctor. I think you make a good point, Mr. Kennedy, we slant the table. Mr. Kennedy. In terms of budget cutting, there's always a fight for those of us who represent prime graduate medical education programs. And we're fighting for the dollars. But if there are going to be cuts, let's make sure that the funding goes to support our priorities. Mr. Hoyer. If Mr. Kennedy will yield, I am very confident that because Mr. Regula is such an effective leader of this Committee, that our 302(b) allocation will be sufficient to fund all the priorities that this Nation ought to be investing in. [Laughter.] Mr. Regula. Take down his words. [Laughter.] ---------- Thursday, March 22, 2001. OHIO STATE UNIVERSITY COLLEGE OF LAW WITNESS GREGORY H. WILLIAMS, DEAN OF THE OHIO STATE UNIVERSITY COLLEGE OF LAW Mr. Regula. Okay, Mr. Hoyer, you're going to introduce Greg Williams. Mr. Hoyer. Dr. Williams, the Dean of the---- Mr. Regula. I'm trying to figure this one out. It's an Ohio State University Law School Dean, and we go to Maryland to get him introduced. Mr. Hoyer. Well, it's not so surprising, because of course, Dr. Britt Kerwin was the President of the University of Maryland College Park for many years, until stolen away in the dead of night by Ohio State. But I frankly think that we're sort of a twofer here. I don't think it was lost on the folks that put together their spokesperson that he was from Ohio State. Not that they would be that cynical, understand. [Laughter.] I understand that. Mr. Regula. Trained in Maryland, learned well. Mr. Hoyer. Dean, we welcome you to this Committee. Mr. Chairman, I suppose the reason that I'm doing this is that I had been a proponent last year of a program that was authorized in 1998. The Dean is going to talk about it. But the effort is to, we talk about diversity, we talk about reaching out to people, and to include the legal profession, the medical profession, other professions, so that we do have a diversity, not just so that we have diversity for diversity's sake, but diversity so that we will have expertise and experience in various different cohorts of our population. It's an extraordinarily important effort. And so I suppose it's for that reason that I am doing this. But Dean, we welcome you to discuss this Thurgood Marshall program, Thurgood Marshall, of course, a son of Maryland as well. That may be another reason, Mr. Chairman, that I'm involved in this. But in any event, Ohio State, as you know, one of the great institutions of this country. And I might say, Dr. Kerwin, I teased, you didn't steal him at all, he chose to go there. But in my opinion, one of the finest educational leaders in our country. We were very, very sorry to lose him. He is an extraordinary talent, as you know, Dean, and I know a delight to work with as well. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. Mr. Williams. Thank you, Mr. Hoyer, and thank you, Mr. Chairman, for being here. I appreciate the opportunity, and Mr. Hoyer, you're right, Dr. Kerwin is truly outstanding and we are very fortunate to have him at Ohio State. As indicated, I am Dean of the Ohio State University College of Law. It's a real pleasure to be here. I want to thank you, Mr. Hoyer, for your support of Thurgood Marshall Educational Opportunity Program. It's been very important, and we appreciate that support. Actually, it's certainly consistent with things you've done in the past and things you've supported. You may not remember, but our meeting goes back many years ago. Thirty years ago, you and I served on the national membership committee of the Young Democratic Clubs of America. Mr. Hoyer. How could I forget? Mr. Williams. Thank you. So it's a real pleasure to be here today. I'm speaking as past president of the Association of American Law Schools, as well as Dean of the Ohio State University College of Law, and for Martha Barnett, the President of the American Bar Association, who unfortunately is not able to be here. But more importantly, actually, I'm speaking as a legal educator with 25 years experience working with the CLEO program, which I'm sure you know administers the Thurgood Marshall program. For almost a quarter of a century, I personally have recruited law students to this program, minority, disadvantaged students, and have worked with them to develop their legal careers. In 1999, I served as the first African American male president of the Association of American Law Schools, and my theme as president of the association of American Law Schools was enhancing diversity in the legal profession. I spent a lot of time working with law schools around the country talking about the issues that the Committee is concerned about. As you know, Congress has authorized the Thurgood Marshal program in the Higher Education Act Amendments of 1998, and the program is designed to increase the number of low income, minority and disadvantaged persons in the legal profession. The Marshall program is administered through the Council on Legal Education Opportunity, which is a non-profit organization supported by the American Bar Association, as well as the Association of American Law Schools and a number of other groups. The CLEO program was established in 1968 to make it possible for economically and culturally disadvantaged students to enter and successfully complete law school. Since that time, over 6,000, over 6,000 students have gone through the CLEO program. I have personally seen many of these students, in fact, I've taught in the CLEO programs in Iowa and Ohio and Wisconsin and other places. And of all the students that I've seen go through the program in the last 25 years, I can't recall more than two that did not successfully complete the program. So it is a program that truly has made a difference. In fact, I think there are three members of Congress presently serving who went through the CLEO program. It's a program that has truly made a difference. The CLEO training program as funded by the Marshall program has been so successful that many States have tried to emulate it. Chairman Regula, as you may know, Chief Justice Moyer, of the Supreme Court of Ohio, has developed a program to develop a CLEO type program in the State of Ohio to complement the national efforts that are ongoing, and Chief Justice Moyer, of course, has provided greater leadership on this issue. By opening the doors of opportunity to more minority and disadvantaged students, the Marshall program will help to ensure that the legal profession reflects the diversity of the population that it serves. The social justice system that represents the population that it serves is a critical component to maintaining public trust and confidence in the justice system. A recent ABA report called Public Perceptions of the Justice System found that almost half of all Americans believe that the justice system treats minorities different than whites. A significant contributor to this perception is a society that's nearly 30 percent persons of color, yet minority representation in the legal profession is less than 10 percent. One key to remedy this crisis in confidence, in my view, in the justice system is to increase the number of minorities serving as lawyers, judges, prosecutors, public defenders and legislators. Over the past five years, minority law enrollment has increased only four-tenths of 1 percent, the smallest increase in the past 20 years. In 1999, the total number ofminority law graduates in the United States dropped for the first time since 1985. With the minority population growing in the United States and the law school enrollment increasing only at four-tenths of 1 percent, minority representation in the legal profession looks bleak. Currently, minority representation in other areas actually is much higher, including accounting and economics, engineering and medicine. All of those are higher in representation of minorities than the legal profession. Increasing diversity in the legal profession has multiple advantages even beyond the public trust and confidence. Within an educational setting, there's been a number of studies recently, for instance, one done at Harvard and the University of Michigan that found that it really made a difference when the classes were diverse in terms of the experience that the students were going to be able to get in law school. And of course, what we find is most of the, not most, but many of the graduates who go through the CLEO program and minority students are in fact going out to serve those communities that need service the most. It appears that my time is finished, but I would urge you to seriously consider funding the Thurgood Marshall program. It is a program that has truly made a difference in this country and deserves your continued support. And I thank you very much. [Editor's Note.--Prepared statement to be kept as part of committee files.] Mr. Regula. You make a very good point. Any other questions? Well, thank you for coming. We have a vote on the rule on tornado shelters and two suspensions and a possible motion to adjourn. I don't know why anyone would want to adjourn. [Recess.] Mr. Regula. We have a vote coming up very soon. Let us see if we can take one more witness before we have to vote. ---------- Thursday, March 22, 2001. COALITION OF ACADEMIC HEALTH CENTERS WITNESS DONALD C. HARRISON, SENIOR VICE PRESIDENT AND PROVOST FOR HEALTH AFFAIRS, UNIVERSITY OF CINCINNATI Dr. Harrison. Good morning, Mr. Chairman and members of the subcommittee. Mr. Chairman, your good friend, Bill Keating, who has visited me a number of times, sends his regards. My name is Dr. Donald Harrison. I am the Senior Vice President and Provost for Health Affairs at the University of Cincinnati. I am also a practicing cardiologist and I served as National President of the American Heart Association and Vice President of the American College of Cardiology. I was Chief of Cardiology for 20 years. I am here on behalf of a coalition of 20 academic health centers across the nation to highlight issues of concern to all academic health centers in the United States. We are the institutions that conduct a significant portion of extramural, biomedical and behavioral research funded through the National Institutes of Health. I would like to thank all of the members of this subcommittee for the outstanding support to NIH over the past several years. These additional funds have clearly had significant impact on the cause, prevention and the treatment of health problems, which afflict the citizens of our nation and the world. A few of these merit mention. First, the life expectancy of our citizens has increased by more than 20 years since the1930s to reach 76 years for males and 80 years for females for a child born today. Secondly, the adjusted death rate from heart disease and heart attacks has been reduced by 40 percent in the past 25 years. Thirdly, our ever-increasing elderly citizens live much more active lives, thanks to artificial joint replacement, pacemakers and medications which prevent osteoporosis and the treatment of breast and prostate cancer and the control of diabetes. On the other hand, the advances in the future, which can be developed from the human genome project, will dwarf our past accomplishments. I am here today to seek your support for further enhancing this extraordinary partnership that has been established with great foresight over the years between the academic institutions and the Federal government. For the fiscal year 2002, we urge you to provide a $3,400,000,000 increase for the NIH, which is a little more than 16 percent. Such an increase will bring the Agency's budget to $23,700,000,000 and keep on track to double the NIH budget by fiscal year 2003. I will repeat a statistic that I am sure you all are very aware of. The NIH currently funds fewer than four of every ten approved research grants. For this reason, I urge you to continue your efforts to double the NIH budget by 2003. We are really just at the dawn of the biomedical revolution. This increased funding will keep our world preeminence in medical innovation. It will also fuel our country's economic growth and development. Universities and other research institutions bear the cost for conducting NIH research that are not supported by the Federal research dollars. In fact, all institutions, both public and private, provide part of the research expense for their institutions. Let me raise a major concern regarding the state of extramural research facilities and laboratories. For the past two years the NIH has included $75,000,000 in extramural research facilities and laboratories. For the past two years the NIH has included $75,000,000 in extramural construction funding through the National Center for Research Resources. It is vitally important that institutions have the facilities and equipment to exploit research opportunities and utilize the increased projected grant funding. Exciting developments in genomics, molecular biology and neuroscience, cancer and many other fields require these kinds of laboratories and instrumentation. Even the best minds cannot compensate for outdated equipment and facilities. New technology is expensive, but it is important for the advancement of science. That National Science Foundation, in a study in 1998 on the status of scientific and engineering research facilities in the United States colleges and universities found that there was $11,500,000,000 in deferred research construction and repairs needed. I urge the subcommittee to provide the funding level of $250,000,000 for extramural research construction in the year 2002. A second significant concern of academic medical centers is the increased cost of research institutions for complying with research related Federal regulations. While extramural researchers have always been subject to Federal research regulations, the increasing number of research administration imposed on institutions has resulted in escalated costs. Let me stress that researchers are not opposed to providing these safeguards and do not question the necessity of the measures. But we believe that the Federal government and the Federal Research Institution should help us fund the cost of these regulations. Finally, I would ask the committee to consider $50,000,000 to go to the Agency for Health Care Research and Quality to reduce medical errors. This is a major problem. Mr. Chairman, the polls reflect the fact that the American public strongly supports Federal investment in biomedical research. Each of these institutions mentioned will increase the productivity of this relationship. Best wishes to you and good health to all Members of the Committee. [The information follows:] [GRAPHIC(S) NOT AVAILABLE IN TIFF FORMAT] Mr. Regula. We accept that. Mr. Hoyer. Mr. Chairman, I know you are trying to go vote, but Dr. Harrison mentioned that the average life expectancy of a child born today was 76 for males and 80 for females. Mr. William Hazeltine, whom you may know, who was one of the leaders in the mapping of the human genome, spoke to our bipartisan retreat. He indicated--and he was speaking to the younger members, not me, because my grandchildren perhaps fall in this category. He said he believes that the average life expectancy of the children of the younger Members, Patrick's age, would be 100 and that the life expectancy of our grandchildren would be 120, which obviously will be confronting us with extraordinary challenges as well. But it is amazing. Dr. Harrison. That is a wonderful goal. Mr. Kennedy. Mr. Chairman, that means when I get to be Chairman I get to be there for a while. Mr. Regula. That is right. Mr. Hoyer. He didn't say the rest of us were going to die real soon, however. Mr. Regula. The committee will be suspended for approximately 20 minutes. [Recess.] Mr. Regula. We will reconvene the committee. Our next witness is Dr. Charles Schuster, Professor of Psychiatry and Behavioral Neuroscience, Wayne State University College of Medicine. Welcome. ---------- Thursday, March 22, 2001. COLLEGE ON PROBLEMS OF DRUG DEPENDENCE, INC. WITNESS CHARLES R. SCHUSTER, PROFESSOR OF PSYCHIATRY AND BEHAVIORAL NEUROSCIENCE, WAYNE STATE UNIVERSITY SCHOOL OF MEDICINE Dr. Schuster. Thank you very much. First of all, let me ask permission to change my written testimony from ``good morning'' to ``good afternoon.'' Mr. Regula. Or ``good evening.'' Dr. Schuster. I am here today representing not only myself as a drug abuse research scientist and treatment provider, but as well I serve as the President of the College on Problems of Drug Dependence. The college has been in existence since 1929 and is the oldest and largest scientific society devoted to the study of addictions. It has over 600 members and about 1,000 people come to our annual scientific meeting. The membership is comprised of a broad array of scientists, from molecular biologists through criminologists, policy analysts, and sociologists, et cetera, concerned with the range of problems that drug abuse is involved with. I would like to first of all today, on behalf of the college, thank this committee for their support of the NIH in general in terms of the doubling of its budget, and specifically for its support of the National Institute on Drug Abuse and appeal to you for continuing this support for it obviously is one of the nation's most important problems. On the way here today I came across a recent report from Constant Horgan of Brandeis, which states that substance abuse, is the nation's top health problem, causing more deaths, illness and disabilities than any other preventable health problem today. I am not going to burden you with statistics about that because we are all aware of the tragedies associated with it. What I would like to say is that the National Institute on Drug Abuse is a governmental organization that is very important, not only to the members of the College, but as well to our society in general, because it supports the overwhelming majority of scientific research on the complex problems associated with drug abuse and dependence. This research has already paid off in a number of ways in terms of the development of effective prevention and treatment interventions, which are already being utilized. However, a great deal more is in the pipeline. We are at a time when advances are occurring very, very rapidly. In my written testimony I said that we were studying the long-term effects of methamphetamine or speed on the brain and that definitive evidence would be soon forthcoming. Well, in the weeks between the time I wrote this and the time I am coming here a report has come out definitely corroborating the fact that methamphetamine causes the same kind of brain damage in humans that has been reported in laboratory animals for many, many years. So, this is a very rapidly emerging field. My own group is now studying MDMA or Ecstasy in terms of the effects of it on the brain. One of the things we are very interested in and is of the utmost importance to us to understand if we are going to be able to effectively treat the problem of drug abuse is what happens in the brain when people move from casual, experimental drug use to regular drug use and finally to compulsive drug use, which is what characterizes addiction. What is going on in the brain there? We now have the techniques to PET scanning, functional MRI and magnetic resin spectroscopy to study these kinds of things in living human beings and animals. Rapid advances are being made in this area today. In addition, NIDA's research has been responsible for a variety of behavioral interventions to help people cope with the behavioral changes that they have to make when they transition from being active drug users to a drug abstinent state. These are very effective procedures that are now being utilized across the United States and I think are making a real difference. One of the areas that I am personally involved in that I think is very exciting is the so-called National Drug Abuse Treatment Clinical Trials network. This is a new program at NIDA, which is designed to bridge the gap between academicresearchers, which is myself, and community treatment programs. It is true in all branches of medicine that there is a gap, but it is particularly large in the area of the treatment of drug abuse. NIDA has now established a network of 14 regional training and research centers. These are academic centers spread out across the United States, each one of which has gone out into their community and established a collaborative relationship with community treatment programs where research has never gone on. Now, what we are doing is taking new treatment interventions which have been shown under rigidly controlled clinical trials to be effective or efficacious, as we call it. We are then looking at them in community treatment programs to find out if they are useful in the real world. If they are useful, how can we better get other community treatment programs that are not part of the CTN to adopt their use. This is the goal of this project. Although there are 14 of these centers around the United States linked up with about 100 treatment programs, I think the National Institute on Drug Abuse is very much interested in expanding this. Mr. Regula. Are all addictions centered in the brain? Dr. Schuster. Yes. Mr. Regula. What does the body do, send a message that they want to smoke or that they want a shot, to the brain? Dr. Schuster. The message begins in the brain. We have studies now in which we can take individuals who are chronic drug users, we put them into a machine called a Functional MRI and we provoke them to crave drugs by giving them cues that have in the past been associated with their drug use. We can delineate the regions of the brain that are activated when they see these cues and they report an overwhelming urge to get the drug. Mr. Regula. So, part of drug therapy would be to change patterns of the things that trigger? Dr. Schuster. Absolutely. This is can be done in a couple of ways. First of all, we are looking for medications that may decrease craving. We are also looking for behavioral and psychological interventions that may alter that. Great progress has really been made because we understand the mechanisms now. [The information follows:] [GRAPHIC(S) NOT AVAILABLE IN TIFF FORMAT] Mr. Regula. Very interesting. Mr. Kennedy. Mr. Kennedy. I wanted to get into the whole idea of this being behavioral and biological. We, obviously, need to fund more research in the area of how the genome and how we can intervene earlier. Because to wait until people get to be addicts is just a waste of time. I think it is probably very useful for us to advance the concept that the brain is part of the body and mental health is overall health so that we don't have insurance companies treating people differently for mental health issues that are chronic like drug and substance abuse any different from asthma or diabetes or anything like that. We need to get this bill passed in this Congress, hopefully the Domenici Parity Bill and the Roukema bill on this side will pass, because that is the best thing we can do in my view right now, to get more treatment to people out there. Dr. Schuster. I would also like to comment on the fact that one of the problems that we have with the treatment of drug addiction is the fact that many of the people that we see also have concomitant mental health problems, other psychiatric disorders. It is very common. Yet, because of the separation in the funding streams, it is oftentimes very difficult for us to provide both services in the same site. As a consequence of this, when you take somebody, as somebody said earlier today, they don't have a car. They have to take three buses. You refer them to a psychiatrist or a mental health clinic on the other side of town and they don't get there. We really have to work on trying to mainstream these so that we can provide these kinds of services in the same venue, so to speak. Mr. Kennedy. That is my point, Mr. Chairman, about the schools for the kids because it is a non-threatening environment. It is not some substance abuse treatment center, some mental health place that has all kinds of stigmas laden with it. You can treat people collocated. As you said, a lot of this is behavioral and it is mental health. We need to identify these kids who are predisposed, either through sociological factors, their parents, they have trouble at home, their parents are addicts or what have you, and address it early on. Mr. Regula. Thank you for coming. Dr. Schuster. Could I have ten seconds? Research has shown that if we could ensure the children learn to read in the first grade, if they become positively engaged in school that is the most effective prevention intervention we could have. Mr. Regula. Good point. We have the whole gamut here.Thank you. Mr. Steve Wilhide, President of the Southern Ohio Health Service Network. Thursday, March 22, 2001. NATIONAL ASSOCIATION OF COMMUNITY HEALTH CENTERS, INC. WITNESS STEVE WILHIDE, PRESIDENT, SOUTHERN OHIO HEALTH SERVICE NETWORK Mr. Wilhide. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. Mr. Chairman and members of the subcommittee, I want to thank you for the opportunity to be here today. I am President and CEO of the Southern Ohio Health Services Network, which is a rural community health center. I am speaking on behalf of the National Association of Community Health Centers regarding funding for the Consolidated Health Center Program within the Department of Health and Human Services. I would like to thank this committee for your increases that have enabled us to serve millions more people nationwide in our community health centers. We appreciate your commitment to this program and appreciate your consideration of expanding the program so we can serve millions more. Southern Ohio Health Services Network is a Federally supported community health center founded in 1976. I was brought there as the first Executive Director. Our first year's budget was $49,000. It was an Appalachian Regional Commission grant and $200,000 from the Department of Health and Human Services to provide direct care. Today, approaching our 25th anniversary, we have a budget of approximately $17,000,000 of which about 20 percent comes from a Federal grant and we serve approximately 50,000 people who had one or more visits for one or more services last year. We have over 50 physicians, dentists, nurse practitioners, social workers, and clinical psychologists. Mr. Regula. Do you have volunteers? Mr. Wilhide. We have volunteers. We have a volunteer physician who is retired that I met through my church who volunteers. We have a nurse who is retired and volunteers and we have a volunteer board that is very, very active. I will be getting back to my board meeting this afternoon. Nationwide, health centers serve 11 million people, 4.6 million of whom have no health insurance. We applaud President Bush's call to double the number of patients served by health centers and to double the number of sites. We would urge Congress to appropriate $175,000,000 more in order to achieve that goal. I think it is important to understand that community health centers are locally controlled and operated entities. The boards of those health centers, the majority of whom are consumers of the care, determine what health care needs are prioritized and then hold me accountable for reporting back to them as to what progress we are making toward clinical outcome goals. So, the board, each year, sets forth a list of clinical priorities, whether they want to decrease the risk of diabetics who have foot problems or what have you. We report to the board on our progress. Back in 1977 and 1978 two of our counties had the highest infant mortality rates in the State of Ohio, higher than many Third World countries. The board felt this was unacceptable. We targeted that program. We were able to receive a Maternal and Child Health grant in addition to our Federal dollars and other dollars. We worked with the entire community, public health departments, and community action programs with outreach, the Grads Program which targets pregnant teenagers to keep them in school. Mr. Regula. Did that include nutrition help? Mr. Wilhide. Absolutely. We also have the WIC Program that we operate. We were able to integrate all these services into one comprehensive approach. Because as many people have indicated before, it is not a medical problem, it is not a psychological problem, it is total integration that makes up the human being. So, we actually were able to recruit, through the National Service Corps, and we would not have gotten these doctors had we not, pediatricians and obstetricians, gynecologists. The first pediatrician ever to serve in Brown County just retired a few months ago. I am please to report today that our infant mortality rates are below State average in those two counties and 82 percent of women are getting first trimester prenatal care compared to about 58 percent before we started the campaign. Again, it was a combination of education, nutrition, socialwork, and psychology, integrated together into one setting. In addition to being responsive to local health care needs, community health centers have proven to be effective and efficient over the years. They provide their comprehensive services at an average cost of about $350 per person per year. That is obviously less than $1 per person served. They are having many studies to show their cost effectiveness in reducing hospitalization, reducing unnecessary emergency room utilization, higher child immunizations. My own program has a 93 percent immunization rate of two-year-olds. That is considerably above the State average. So, again, I think we are not a medical model. We are a comprehensive model with a variety of services based upon the needs of our own individual communities. Last year the National Association of Community Health Centers surveyed 100 health centers and found that those health centers could serve 50 percent more people if funding was available. In order to do this we are going to have to establish new sites in new locations and expand existing services in present locations. By way of example, in Adams County, which you may not be familiar with, which fortunately now is only the second poorest county in the State, I think Perry County is first; we opened a 23,500 square foot mall-type service facility and closed two aging facilities that were inadequate. We have in that facility the only psychiatrist in the county, a clinical pharmacy, internal medicine, the WIC Program, social work. There is a significant increase in the numbers of elderly served and dental. We have gone from three dental operatories to nine and the appointment books are full right now. [The information follows:] [GRAPHIC(S) NOT AVAILABLE IN TIFF FORMAT] Mr. Regula. I am sure they are. Thank you for coming. I think those community health centers do great work. Mr. Donald Price, President of the Society for Neuroscience. ---------- Thursday, March 22, 2001. SOCIETY FOR NEUROSCIENCE WITNESS DONALD L. PRICE, PRESIDENT Dr. Price. Good afternoon. My name is Don Price. I am a Professor of Neurology, Pathology and Neuroscience at Johns Hopkins and present President of the Society for Neuroscience. The Society for Neuroscience has about 28,000 members and its major commitment is to basic and clinical neuroscience. We are obviously very grateful for the support that we have gotten in the past and that biomedical research has gotten in the possibility. So, with that as a background, I want to depart from those remarks and give you an example of a human disease where really extraordinary progress has been made. That is Alzheimer's disease, which is the most common cause of dementia in late life. I think we are now on the threshold of coming up with therapeutic targets which could prevent this disease. What I would like to do, because you heard for example, an elegant discussion of the problem of rats. I would like to explain how that happens. The first thing that happened with Alzheimer's was to define it as a disease. The second thing was to look at the brain and find that there were very unusual deposits called ambyloid in the brain tissue. Then, the gene that encoded the protein that gave rise to ambyloid was identified. It turns out that it was like this pen. It is a protein thatlooks like this and the ambyloid component is imbedded in it. So, somehow abnormal scissors, enzymes, leave that peptide out and it becomes deposited in the brain of an Alzheimer's patient and causes the disease. Over the past few years we have identified mutations in that gene that are linked to the human disease. I brought two specimens, one from my grandson and the other from my administrative assistant. It is not hard to tell which is the Alzheimer mouse versus the other. But basically, what you can do is you can take the mutant human gene, put it in the mouse and the mouse will come up with the disease. It is now possible to use these mutant mice to test mechanisms and therapies. It represents the kind of advance that I think we are going to see over the next decade for Parkinson's disease, for Rett syndrome where the gene has now been identified, and so forth. It really represents an extraordinary step forward in terms of trying to treat disorders which, when I was neurology resident and a clinician, one really didn't want to diagnose because the news was so bad for the family. It is now possible to knock out the genes that make these scissor-like clips. It turns out when you knock those genes out in mice, the mice look perfectly well. What that tells you is that you could then give this mouse an inhibitor of that cleavage product, that enzyme, and this would not happen. The mouse would not get Alzheimer's disease. If it works in mice, it should work in humans. To emphasize the point that was made before about prevention, if one comes up with a small molecule that can get into the brain that can inhibit these enzyme activities that cleave this ambyloid protein, one could potentially completely prevent a disease like Alzheimer's. I think the same story is going to be translated to Lou Gehrig's disease and many of the other devastating neurological diseases. When genes are identified for psychiatric diseases, we are going to be able to do the same kinds of things. So, really, that is how the NIH monies are being invested. I think they are critical if we are going to improve the health of our population. Thank you very much. [The information follows:] [GRAPHIC(S) NOT AVAILABLE IN TIFF FORMAT] Mr. Regula. Thank you. Are there questions? I have just one. Does Alzheimer's have a pattern of onset that you would start this treatment once you identified it? You would not do it in a healthy person, I assume. Dr. Price. No. I think it would depend. I mean Alzheimer's disease clearly starts much earlier than the first obvious clinical sign. If you had a very safe drug, you could start it early. The earliest case of Alzheimer's that I know of is a young person who had a gene lesion who got it at 16 years of age. So, it can occur from 16 to late 80s. But it usually has a very indolent course. So, to answer your question directly, if you had a safe therapy, then one might treat patients prospectively. Mr. Regula. I understand there is some genetic pattern, that it is inherited. Dr. Price. That is right. It is really the identification of those genes that has allowed this kind of research to go forward. That is what we are going to see, I think, in psychiatry in the next decade. Mr. Regula. Well, thank you for coming. Dr. Price. Thanks very much. Mr. Regula. Dr. Robert Felter, Chairman of Pediatrics and Medical Director, Tod Children's Hospital in Youngstown. I am happy to welcome you. ---------- Thursday, March 22, 2001. NATIONAL ASSOCIATION OF CHILDREN'S HOSPITALS WITNESS ROBERT A. FELTER, CHAIRMAN OF PEDIATRICS AND MEDICAL DIRECTOR, TOD CHILDREN'S HOSPITAL, YOUNGSTOWN, OHIO Dr. Felter. Good afternoon. My name is Robert Felter. I am a pediatric emergency physician and currently Chairman of Pediatrics and Medical Director of Tod Children's Hospital in Youngstown, Ohio. Thank you for the opportunity to testify on behalf of the National Association of Children's Hospitals. Mr. Chairman, I especially want to thank you and the members of your committee and your colleagues very much for last year's appropriation off $235,000,000 for Graduate Medical Education or GME Programs for the nation's nearly 60 pediatric teaching hospitals. You enacted this funding at a time when it was critically needed by hospitals all across the country. Your 2001 appropriation is a major step toward fulfilling the Congress's authorization of the $285,000,000 needed to provide equitable Federal support for our GME Programs. In today's increasingly price competitive health care marketplace, Medicare has become the only major reliable source of GME support. Teaching hospitals absolutely rely on it to remain competitive. But children's hospitals qualify for virtually no Federal GME support from Medicare because we care for children. On the average, one of our hospitals receives less than one half of one percent of the GME support which other teaching hospitals receive through Medicare. That creates a huge gap in Federal support for children's hospitals. According to the Lewin Group, it amounts to about $285,000,000 annually. It puts at risk not only our hospitals, but also the future of our entire pediatric workforce and health care for all children. Here is why: On the average our hospitals consist of less than one percent of all hospitals, but we train nearly 30 percent of all pediatricians, nearly 50 percent of all pediatric specialists and almost all pediatric emergency specialists such as myself. We are also the major pipeline for future pediatric research. We also serve all children, regardless of economic need, from the furthest rural to the nearest inner city neighborhoods. We provide personal, compassionate care combined with state-of-the-art medical treatment. Mr. Chairman, as we discussed in your office last week, you know that this affects my own hospital very much. We provide more than 30 pediatric sub-specialists and highly specialized programs such as our pediatric in-patient cancer unit. We serve all children. More than 60 percent of our care at Tod Children's goes to children who are assisted by Medicaid or have no insurance. We also train 27 medical residents each year. The majority of them go into practice in the Youngstown area or in Ohio. Mr. Regula. You got some financial support for that program out of this committee this current year; right? Dr. Felter. Yes, we got $200,000 for Tod and we will get a little over $1,000,000 this year from the increased finances. Again, it costs us about $200,000,000. As you know, Youngstown is an economically depressed community, which makes it difficult for us to attract and retain strong clinical talent. The loss of our GME Program would seriously affect Youngstown's pediatric workforce. We face the potential for that loss right now. We spend more than $2,000,000, our hospital does, just on the direct cost of the program. We face increasing pressures to eliminate either that training program or other programs. Frankly, without strong Federal funding through Children's Hospital GME program, the future of our training program is in jeopardy. That in turn puts into jeopardy the long-term future of our children's hospital and the health of our community. With such a major impact on small institutions such as Tod Children's Hospital, you can image the impact of this funding on much larger institutions in their regions such as Children's Hospital in Boston or Los Angeles, which train hundreds of residents. Please take the next step to close the gap by appropriating full funding this year. It is vital for the future of our pediatric workforce and the healthcare of all children. Thank you again for your past support. We appreciate very much your consideration of our request today for fulfillment of equitable GME support for children's hospitals. [The information follows:] Mr. Peterson [assuming chair]. I didn't really hear most of your testimony, but I didn't really need to. I am very familiar with Pennsylvania's Pittsburgh Children's Hospital and CHOP in Philadelphia. I call them miracle hospitals, because that is really what you do. We send our very sickest children to you and you do miracles. I totally support, personally, and I am just speaking for one person, of closing that gap. If there is any part of our teaching system that should not have been shortchanged, it is our kids. Dr. Felter. Thank you very much. I appreciate the support. Mr. Peterson. Are there any questions? Thank you very much. Next we will hear from Stephen Bartels, President of the American Association for Geriatric Psychiatry. We welcome you. Please proceed. ---------- Thursday, March 22, 2001. AMERICAN ASSOCIATION FOR GERIATRIC PSYCHIATRY WITNESS STEPHEN BARTELS, PRESIDENT Dr. Bartels. Mr. Chairman and members of the subcommittee I am Dr. Stephen Bartels, President of the American Association for Geriatric Psychiatry. AAGP is a professional membership organization dedicated to promoting the mental health and well being of older Americans and improving the care of those with late life mental disorders. Mr. Chairman, I join many of those other witnesses here today in thanking the subcommittee for its continued strong support for increased funding for the National Institutes of Health over the last several years. However, I am here today to convey the serious concern shared by researchers, clinicians and consumers that there exists a critical disparity between Federally funded research on mental health and aging and mental health needs of older Americans. Mr. Chairman, as we have already heard today, the U.S. Census projects that numbers of Americans over age 65 will increase dramatically over the coming decades. However, despite recent significant increases in appropriations for research in mental health, the proportion of new NIH funds for research on older persons has actually gone down and is woefully inadequate to deal with the impending crisis of mental health in older Americans. With the Baby Boom generation nearing retirement, the number of older Americans experiencing mental health problems is certain to increase in the future. By the year 2010, there will be approximately 40 million people in the United States over the age of 65. Over 20 percent of those people will experience mental disorders. Current and projected economic costs of mental disorders of aging alone are staggering. Depression is an example of a common problem among older persons. Approximately 30 percent of older persons in primary care settings have significant symptoms of depression. Depression is associated with greater health care costs, poor health care outcomes and increased morbidity and mortality. Older adults have the highest suicide rate of any age group. AAGP would like to call to the subcommittee's attention the fact that recent increases in the National Institute of Mental Health and the Center for Mental Health Services have not been reflected in new research funding on mental health in aging. For example, while total research grants awarded by NIMH increased 59 percent in 1995 to the year 2000, NIMH grants for aging research increased at half that rate over the same period. In fact, between 1999 into the year 2000, the actual amount of new funding for aging grants by NIMH declined. I brought this diagram here to show that the proportion of total NIMH newly funded research devoted to aging declined from an average of eight percent in 1995 down to six percent in the year 2000. It is juxtaposed against significant increases that this committee has approved for NIMH over the last several years. I have also taken the liberty to bring this other diagram that shows the increasing numbers of people who are elderly that are projected to come, the associated health care expenditures. This large increase is showing the number of people with mental disorders as opposed to younger people and this is the NIMH funded research at the current rate, which is quite low. Now, Mr. Chairman, the research that this committee has funded shows definitely that treatment works for many mental health problems in older persons. However, if current trends in funding for aging and mental health continue at NIMH and CMHS, we will dramatically fall short of the need for continued developments and our understanding of the causes of mental health problems in older people and the development of effective prevention and treatment. Improving the treatment of late life mental problems will benefit not only the elderly, but also the current Baby Boomer generation whose lives are often profoundly affected by those of their parents who comprise an unprecedented challenge to the future of mental health services in America. In short, Mr. Chairman, this is not simply a concern for our nation's elderly. Under-funding research on mental health in aging is a problem for those of us with parents afflicted with mental disorders and for the future of those of us who will reach retirement age in the next two decades. Based on our assessment of the current need and future challenges of late life mental disorders, we submit the following three recommendations for consideration: One, the current rate of funding for aging grants at NIMH and CMHS is inadequate. Funding of aging research grants by these agencies should be increased by approximately three times the current funding level, to be commensurate with the current need. Two, infrastructures within NIMH and CMHS are needed to support the development of initiatives in aging research, including the creating of positions with these agencies dedicated to promoting, maintaining and monitoring research on mental health in aging. Three, the establishment of grant review committees with specific expertise in reviewing research proposals on mental health in aging. In conclusion, we are dramatically under-investing in research on mental health in aging at a time when the NIMH and CMHS budgets have seen significant increases. The projected economic impact of the aging Baby Boom generation on Medicare and Social Security systems is well known. But there is another challenge that has not received attention. We can expect an unprecedented explosion in the number of people over age 65 with potentially disabling mental disorders. I would like to thank you for allowing me to submit this testimony today. We will be happy to answer any questions. Mr. Peterson. In your research, are you tracking some of the mental health drugs that our seniors have been on for decades? Dr. Bartels. Yes. Mr. Peterson. I would like to just raise one. I have a personal experience. My mother had depression problems all of her life. I don't remember when she would not go into the lows and the highs. She was never doctored until the last two or three decades. I do not think we doctored it much when I was a child. But she was on a drug called Vivactil for maybe 25 or 30 years. I had a younger brother who over a period of time had to get the doctors that prescribed that to reconsider that drug. He had done some research. He was always unsuccessful. I guess I kind of hold myself responsible that I didn't give him more assistance, but I certainly didn't hamper him. Recently, she had a health problem where she broke her hip and was temporarily in a nursing home for rehab. The doctor there quickly agreed with my brother that she ought to be off that drug. My mother could not carry on a conversation with me for three years. My mother can carry unlimited conversation today after six months. I just find that a tragedy that she was deprived of the ability to communicate. She knew my name. She always knew me. She expressed love for her children, but she could not communicate. She is actually gaining. We were blaming it all on Alzheimer's. She is actually gaining the ability to have a conversation with her children. In discussing this with nurses, they feel there are a number of mental health drugs over long periods of time that have actually harmed people's ability to think and carry on a conversation. Do we monitor them long term? Dr. Bartels. Well, not well enough. I think part of that has to do with health services research in pharmacoepidemiology and look at precisely this: co-prescriptions, old medications that have bad side effects that do impair cognition. The good news is that there are new medications which have minimal side effects that enhance functioning. We know, for example, like your mother had a hip fracture, that untreated depression actually results in worse health care outcomes. Those people do not get better as fast and they are more likely to die. So, untreated depression, untreated disorders without the state-of-the-art medications is actually a tragedy. Mr. Peterson. Well, I guess in Pennsylvania where they had the PACE Program where they really know what everybody is on and she was in the PACE Program. I have been going to talk to them because I have worked with them for years at the State level. How many people are still on that drug? I personal think it is a bad drug. Dr. Bartels. I think there are newer and better drugs that are out there and that is part of the research that we are hoping to focus on, looks at those medications, treatment and services that will make a difference for people like your mother. Mr. Peterson. Of course, I am one who thinks we rely too much on drugs today. There are wonderful drugs. I am not against new drugs. Dr. Bartels. There are very effective non-pharmacologic interventions also that we are doing research on. Mr. Peterson. There are so many seniors. I tour home health agencies. Five, six, seven, eight, nine or ten drugs, I am just amazed how many drugs our seniors are on and the complications of them. Are we studying that, too? Dr. Bartels. We are. Our group at Dartmouth is doing just those sorts of studies right now. Mr. Peterson. Do you have any questions? The gentleman from Rhode Island. Mr. Kennedy. I agree, Mr. Chairman. The fact of the matter is seniors are over-utilizing the health care system for many reasons, because they are depressed or they are not getting connections. So, they use the Medicare system as a way to get, you know, some attention and whatever that makes up for lack of proper love and so forth from their family or the losses that they have suffered. If you would establish a kind of program that was a practicum of how to identify depression among seniors, I mean if you had limited resources and I am not talking about the research angle and increasing science, which I agree with you on, but just out there right now, what would be your kind of vision of what a program would look like? Dr. Bartels. I think there are several things. First of all, you are exactly right that we know from health services research that there is increased health services utilization, emergency room visits, hospitalizations, et cetera, with untreated depression. I think the place to go is where seniors are, which is to say that because of the stigma of mental illness, they are less likely to go to specialty care providers. So that primary care physician offices, educating primary care physicians to better identify and use state-of-the-art treatments is a place to go, senior citizens centers as well as senior housing. Some of the innovative programs that we have actually looked at and a number of us have researched, I think, are the places to look at. Mr. Kennedy. I would love to have you share what some of your findings have been in those areas because I would like to get those things back in my community because I know there are too many seniors who are suffering needlessly. People think, oh, that is just part of being old. Dr. Bartels. I would be delighted to talk with you in details about some of these programs. Mr. Kennedy. That would be great. Thanks very much. Mr. Peterson. Thank you. We are trying to accommodate people who have plane reservation problems. We are next going to hear from Dr. Felix Okojie, Vice President, Research and Strategic Initiatives, Jackson State University. If you have a similar problem, let us know. We will try to accommodate you. Please proceed. [GRAPHIC(S) NOT AVAILABLE IN TIFF FORMAT] Thursday, March 22, 2001. JACKSON STATE UNIVERSITY WITNESS FELIX OKOJIE, VICE PRESIDENT, RESEARCH AND STRATEGIC INITIATIVES Dr. Okojie. Mr. Chairman, distinguished members of the subcommittee, I am Felix Okojie, Vice President for Research and Strategic Initiatives at Jackson State University. I want to thank you members of the committee for giving me the opportunity to appear before you today as you consider the fiscal year 2002 funding year priorities for this subcommittee. First of all, I would like to be on record with this committee for the extraordinary and strategic efforts for putting significant amounts of dollars in agencies like NIH and the education in that has helped historically Black colleges and universities across this country to contribute significantly to the health and other problems of the citizens of this country. As a result of the efforts of this committee, I would like to speak very briefly to how Jackson State University in Jackson, Mississippi has benefitted and continues to benefit from the efforts of this committee. There are two initiatives that the university is very much interested in that we think, because of the resources that have already been invested at the university by Federal agencies as a result of the appropriations from this committee, can even further enhance the critical goal that we have. There is a study going on right now in Jackson called The Jackson House Study, which is an epidemiological, cardiovascular disease study by the largest CVD study for African-Americans in this country. Within that we also have a major cancer study going on at the medical school. Jackson State University recently developed an epidemiological institute where CVD and things like prostate cancer will be the major focus. Jackson State University is at the forefront in trying to help to meet some of the disparity, particularly in the area of cities in Mississippi and this country. One of the initiatives we would like to highlight is the establishment of a minority Rural and Urban Health and Wellness Center. The impetus for this center is as a result of the critical mass of the human resource and intellectual capital that has been harnessed over the years to do a lot of disparity studies in collaboration with institutes like NIH and CDC. Information out of these studies can be disseminated both in the rural and urban areas of the State as well as across different parts of this country. So, the Health and Wellness Center would take advantage of this synergy and the intellectual capital to capitalize and to disseminate significant information on both disparities as it relates to those common issues that afflict minority populations in Mississippi and in other parts of this country. I ask this committee that sufficient funding be provided in the health facilities account of the HHS section of the Education Appropriations bill to support projects such as this that Jackson State is proposing. The other major project is a project called the Mississippi e-Center at Jackson State University. This is a center that we would like the committee to be aware of. Again, this center is designed to create some more outreach efforts through the use of technology to reach urban and rural areas in Mississippi, as well as providing some new and innovative ideas that can help service some of the needs across this country by using research, e-technology programming and e-service opportunities to meet the needs of minorities in this country as well as major aspects of people in this country. Mr. Chairman, thank you for this opportunity. I will take any questions. [The information follows:] [GRAPHIC(S) NOT AVAILABLE IN TIFF FORMAT] Mr. Peterson. Thank you very much. I guess we have no questions. Next, we will call on Dorothy Hill, President of the American Psychiatric Nurses Association. Please proceed. ---------- Thursday, March 22, 2001. AMERICAN PSYCHIATRIC NURSES ASSOCIATION WITNESS DOROTHY HILL, PRESIDENT Ms. Hill. Mr. Chairman, my name is Dottie Hill and I am Vice President of Patient Care at Arcadia Hospital in Bangor, Maine. I am here today as President of the American Psychiatric Nurses Association, or APNA. Thank you for providing me with the opportunity to outline APNA's funding priorities for fiscal year 2002. Founded in 1987, APNA is comprised of approximately 4,000 psychiatric nurses representing every State in the nation. Our mission is to advance psychiatric and mental health nursing practice, improve mental health care for culturally diverse individuals, families, groups and communities and to help shape mental health care policy. Before moving on, I would like to quickly review some startling statistics to demonstrate the impact mental illness has on our country. One out of every five children has a mental health disorder. Two-thirds of our nation's seniors living in nursing homes have a mental health disorder. Although 80 percent of those with depression can be effectively treated, only one out of three receives appropriate treatment. The economic burden related to mental illness is staggering with the total estimated cost for mental health disorders in 1994 at approximately $204,000,000,000. I would like to reiterate that mental illnesses are biological, medical illnesses. First APNA is seeking increased Federal support for psychiatric nursing research. Psychiatric nurses have been and will continue to be an integral part of our nation's research community. With this in mind, APNA would like to commend this subcommittee and in particular, Congresswoman DeLauro for the fiscal year 2001 appropriations measure that led to a joint NINR and NIH mentorship program for psychiatric nurse researchers. The program will support the development of expert psychiatric mental health nurse researchers in the area of measuring outcomes in the care of psychiatric patients. APNA is extremely excited about this program and wishes to acknowledge the tremendous work done by Dr. Patricia Grady, Director of NINR, and Dr. Steven Hyman, Director of NIMH, and the staff at both institutions. In addition to supporting the nurse researcher mentorship program, strong Federal support is needed in order to build our nation's research capacity by ensuring an adequate supply of nurse researchers. As a result, we would ask the committee to include nurse researchers in any research-related loan repayment program so that we can attract the most promising students into psychiatric nursing research. We would also like to take a moment to note our concern that current NIH and NINR funding does not fully reflect the broad range of psychiatric nursing research. With the grant funding focused on issues such as violence and substance abuse, while these issues are very important, we would like to extend this research portfolio. In all, APNA is seeking $144,000,000 for NINR and at least a 16.5 percent increase for NIMH. APNA's second priority relates to the nursing shortage our country now faces. I am sure you folks have heard a lot about that. In order to address this serious problem, APNA and other members of the health professions and nursing education coalition recommend at least $440,000,000 in fiscal year 2002 overall funding for Title VII and Title VIII of the Public Health Service Act. These figures do not include funding for the children's hospitals Graduate Medical Education Program, an amount separate from Title VII and Title VIII funding. Within the health professions programs, APNA is joined by other members of the nursing community in seeking a minimum increase of $25,000,000 within Title VIII. Further, we are seeking an additional $10,000,000 for 2002 for the Nursing Education Loan Repayment Program. Equally important, APNA is advocating for an improved data collection to learn even more about our nursing workforce. Finally, APNA would like to ask for the committee's helpto ensure that recent reforms related to the use of seclusion and restraint include the expertise of our nation's psychiatric nurses. We are concerned that new policies could overlook our nation's psychiatric nurses in a way that could negatively impact patient and staff safety. Safety in nursing work environments is crucial with the impending nursing shortage. Thank you very much for providing me with the opportunity to present our funding priorities. I would be happy to answer any questions. [The information follows:] [GRAPHIC(S) NOT AVAILABLE IN TIFF FORMAT] Mr. Peterson. The last county medical society that I met with shared with me that 40 to 50 percent of their patients needed mental health treatment. That has not been historic; has it? Ms. Hill. It actually has been historic, but I don't think we have discovered or admitted or understood that until more recently with some of the advances that we are finding, that people have described before this community in terms of being able to look in people's brains and understanding that many of what we heretofore thought were maybe disorders of aging or just adulthood or disorders related to stress actually had a biological and medical basis. The more we understand that, the more we are beginning to diagnose and hopefully treat those illnesses. Mr. Peterson. But you don't think that is an uncommon figure? Ms. Hill. No, I do not. Mr. Peterson. Do psych nurses basically work in psych units? I have a lot of small rural hospitals. They don't all have psych units. But if they don't have a psych unit, would they hire a psychiatric nurse? Ms. Hill. Eighty percent of our psychiatric nurses are functioning in hospitals, but not in small rural hospitals. If there is not a psychiatric unit in a hospital, it would be very hard to find a psychiatric nurse. Mr. Peterson. They are basically in where the units are? Ms. Hill. Right. Mr. Peterson. You kept using the term ``mental health nursing research.'' I don't quite understand that term. Ms. Hill. Well, in the past most of the nursing research that has been done has not been funded. Psychiatric nursing, mental health nursing research has not been funded or it has been under-funded. We have had some great success in the last year getting some dollars put towards nursing research for psychiatric nursing. That is what we are asking about. Much of the funding has gone to much broader nursing research that does not relate to psychiatry. Mr. Peterson. Is that separated from psychiatric research in general? I guess that is the question maybe I should have asked. Why is it separate who the provider is, whether it is a nurse or a doctor? Ms. Hill. Again, nursing research has a specific body of knowledge all its own which relates to how patient care influences how patient care influences people to get better. It is a different science. Mr. Peterson. Do you think we need to get a little bit drastic, maybe, in our future budgets about dealing with the nursing shortage in general, beyond psychiatric, I mean just in general. Are we approaching, in your view, a huge crisis? Ms. Hill. A drastic crisis. Mr. Peterson. I have young nurses in my district, who, now that we are basically Bachelor's degree nurses, who found that they can go to school one more year and be anything they want. That is a foundation for other careers. So, what we thought was maybe the right direction now allows them to just move on. Several are going to be accountants, CPAs. That is not exactly what you would think a nurse would go to. But because of what they found on the floor in their first two or three years in practice, they are just moving on. They are going to night school and they are going to move on and leave the nursing profession. If it is like that across the country, we are really in trouble. Ms. Hill. That is right. Mr. Peterson. We are always looking for projects or pilots that we can do across this country. I think we really need to put our thinking caps on to discover how we can get people into nursing quickly. Ms. Hill. I agree. Mr. Peterson. I look forward to your advice. Ms. Hill. Thank you. Mr. Peterson. Dr. Robert Schwartz, Professor and Chairman, Department of Family Medicine and Community Health, University of Miami, School of Medicine. Good afternoon and welcome. ---------- Thursday, March 22, 2001. ORGANIZATIONS OF ACADEMIC FAMILY MEDICINE WITNESS ROBERT SCHWARTZ, PROFESSOR AND CHAIR, DEPARTMENT OF FAMILY MEDICINE AND COMMUNITY HEALTH, UNIVERSITY OF MIAMI SCHOOL OF MEDICINE Dr. Schwartz. Thank you. It is an honor and a privilege to be here. As you mentioned, I am Professor and Chair of the Department of Family Medicine and Community Health at the University of Miami School of Medicine. I am also a member of the board and legislative chair of the Society of Teachers of Family Medicine. I have been a practicing physician and teacher for more than 20 years. I thank you for the opportunity to be able to talk on behalf of the organizations of academic family medicine today. I am here to discuss two programs under the purview of this committee: The Family Practice Training Programs under Title VII of the Health Services Act; and the Agency for Health Care Research and Quality, also known as AHRQ. Both of these programs address real and important needs in our society. These programs are not sexy. They do not have a natural and sympathetic constituency. What they do have is a proven ability to make positive changes in our nation's health care and in our patient's lives. These are programs this committee supported well in the last funding cycle. We are asking for that support again this year. We ask in addition that the funding for the Primary Care Medicine and Dentistry Cluster of Title VII be increased $158,000,000. This would allow for $96,000,000 for family practice training programs. Currently, the Federally funded educational system reinforces the sub-specialization of the physician workforce. The President's budget blueprint says that the nation has too many doctors. We respectfully disagree. What we are experiencing is a surplus of specialists. We do have a shortage of doctors, primary care physicians and doctors who care for families. Title VII programs are designed to counter this market bias and support development of the primary care physician workforce. These are the only Federal programs that explicitly fund the infrastructure to produce physicians who will address Congressional stipulated goals. They will help deliver health care to under-served populations. They will bring health care professionals to rural areas and will improve geographic mal- distribution of the physician workforce. We are excited because now we have new data. Federal funding through Title VII of Family Medicine Department's pre- doctoral programs and faculty development has made a difference. A current study shows that these three types of grants really do make a difference in producing more family physicians and more primary care doctors. Pre-doctoral and department development grants made a difference in producing more primary care doctors serving in rural areas and more doctors serving in primary care health professional areas, also known as HPSAs. Sustained funding during the years of medical school training had more positive impact than intermittent funding. Another recent study data show that without family physicians over 1,000 additional counties would qualify for this designation as a HPSA. This compares to an additional 176 counties that would meet the criteria if all internists, pediatricians and obstetricians in aggregate were withdrawn. These funds must be maintained and increased to help our nation's service needs. I would like to share one of the main success stories created by Title VII funding. Dr. Joyce Lawrence is a young African-American woman who grew up in Liberty City, one of the poorest communities in South Florida and even in the country. She was able to gain entrance to the University of Arizona School of Medicine and early in her training was exposed to a Title VII-funded pre-doctoral family medicine. This had an enormous impact on her future. Dr. Lawrence graduated, returned to Miami, determined that she was going to do something for the community in which she grew up. She gained a position in our residency program, supported through the years again by Title VII dollars and successfully completed her three-year post-graduate training. Dr. Lawrence was recently hired as the medical director for a privately-funded school health initiative to put health care back into the Miami-Dade County school system, one of the largest public school systems in the country, one with limited health care access for its predominately minority and under- served community. This is a real success story, but only one of many made possible by sustained Title VII funding for academic family medicine in the country. Mr. Chairman, the other program I am testifying on today is funding for AHRQ. We also appreciate the increased funding provided this past year. However, we support a budget allocation of $400,000,000 for fiscal year 2002. This includes funding for patient safety, translating research into practice, outcomes research and 350 new investigator-initiated grants. Why? Just like Title VII programs, the research conducted through AHRQ is critical to responding to national health care needs. While our country has dramatically increased investment in basic medical science research through NIH programs, there has been little support to answer questions of major concern to many America's and their family physicians. Nor has there been adequate effort to develop the clinical applications in primary care from this new basic science knowledge. We applaud the investment in NIH, but we feel strongly that an increase in funding for AHRQ will dramatically enhance the ability of the recent resources to maximize research in primary care. As a practicing family doctor, I need to know how the rapid advances in new pharmacological products, information, technology, gene therapy, and diagnostic techniques are applicable to the care of my patients. In addition, we need to know the risks of these new treatments and techniques. AHRQ is the only Federal agency to support this. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. [The information follows:] [GRAPHIC(S) NOT AVAILABLE IN TIFF FORMAT] Mr. Peterson. Thank you, Dr. Schwartz. Let me ask the first question. What do you consider primary care? Dr. Schwartz. Well, that is a good question and obviously, it is a controversial one. Mr. Peterson. It shouldn't be. Dr. Schwartz. It shouldn't be. A family doctor is a physician who has been trained to take care of the entire family. They do pediatrics. They do adult medicine. Many of them still do obstetrics and gynecology. They specialize in geriatrics. Behavioral medicine is a very important component of the family medicine programs. It is really the broadest physician that exists in the United States and it is the perfect physician for rural areas and urban centers. The interesting thing is that the majority of the care to poor and minority populations, the under-served, takes place in academic or residency training programs throughout the country. Mr. Peterson. I always considered family physicians internists. OB-GYN, I know that is one lot, too. But I don't understand it because OB-GYNs are many women's primary doctor. And you mentioned pediatrician. Who should I have included in that? Anybody else? Dr. Schwartz. Primary care is usually all of those that you mentioned. But family physicians consider themselves the real primary care physician because we really do the broad range of services where many families go to one physician and then, if they have a problem, they are referred to somebody else and a third and a fourth. One of the things that we hold up most importantly is continuity of care, seeing the same physician year after year, understanding patient's problems and understanding them within the context of family. Those are some of the things that unfortunately modern medicine has pushed aside. We have really created so many sub-specialties, I hear all the time of people being grateful for having a family physician who really knows the entire family. Mr. Peterson. In the rural setting, if I did not look at their license, I would not know an internist from a family physician because they practice almost the same. Most people don't know the difference. Dr. Schwartz. No. That is true. Mr. Peterson. Where are we at today in the percentage coming through the primary care specialty? Do you know what the numbers are nationally? I don't. Dr. Schwartz. Well, you are going to hear in the news very soon that today was the match results and unfortunately family medicine training programs did not do as well as they have done in the past. That is a significant problem. It has improved dramatically in the last decade, but as has been mentioned today, there are many pressures that push students into sub- specialty medicine. Salaries are much higher in diagnostic radiology. Loan repayment is an enormous issue. Students are coming out with $90,000 or $100,000 indebtedness. Those are clearly forces that push people away from doing family medicine. Mr. Peterson. A decade or more ago in State government I chaired health and welfare. I got the attention of our nine medical schools by proposing legislation that would have made those who go into primary care residencies less costly than those who chose the other. The medical schools were all in my office within a week discussing this issue. Now, what I was able to do was-we changed the numbers in Pennsylvania. I have not watched them since I left five years ago. But we changed the numbers and primary care residencies grew in Pennsylvania because of that action and that fear that we were going to do something to penalize them. Of course, some of the bigger schools went back into primary care because they needed the doctors themselves, just to fill their own slots. Now, I guess I would be for loading some incentives. We have to somehow change this. Everett Koop was the one who brought me to the issue years ago. We don't have that kind of a voice any more. He talked about this issue a lot. I don't think people realize where we are headed. Dr. Schwartz. I think you are right. I think it is an extraordinary problem in terms of people understanding that primary care physicians are essential in health care. Many of the problems that were discussed today in terms of the research, et cetera, can only really be handled on the front line. There is less hospitalization than ever before because of the cost of hospitalization. Well, where is that care going to take place but in the community? You also mentioned the issue of medications. I feel very strongly that our communities and patients are over-medicated. One of the reasons we need money in AHRQ is because outcomes research needs to occur in the community. A lot of the things that we empirically know as physicians need resources to be funded. Mr. Peterson. Come to me privately with you are ideas about what we talked about. We are running short of time here today. I would love to talk to you for an hour. Sometime contact me, I will be glad to work with you. Dr. Schwartz. Thank you very much, sir. Mr. Peterson. Next, we are going to hear out of order Patricia Underwood, the First Vice President of the American Nurses Association. If you have a flight problem, let us know. Welcome. Please proceed. ---------- Thursday, March 22, 2001. AMERICAN NURSES ASSOCIATION WITNESS PATRICIA W. UNDERWOOD, FIRST VICE-PRESIDENT Ms. Underwood. Good afternoon. Mr. Chairman and members of the subcommittee, I am Patricia Underwood, the First Vice President of the American Nurses Association, the only full service professional organization representing the nation's 2.7 million registered nurses. This afternoon I will address funding for nursing education and research. The American Nurses Association believes that our shared goal of ensuring the nation of an adequate supply of well-educated nurses will reaffirm the need for increasing funding for these programs. Mr. Chairman, as you know, there is a shortage of nurses, particularly due to a mal-distribution of nurses and their unwillingness to work in dissatisfying and unsafe environments. An even more critical shortage of nurses is coming due to a lack of young people entering the nursing profession. Due to an aging workforce, the average age of the working nurse is 43.3 years, and also due to nurses leaving the profession because of increasingly stressful, non-supportive working environments. This shortage will mean that patients in hospitals and long-term care may not get the frequent checks that they need to ensure quality of care, prevent complications and thereby increase hospital stays and increase mortality. This shortage will also mean that there will be not enough nurses to care for our vulnerable population such as children, the elderly or those with mental health problems. It will mean that there will not be enough nurses to promote health in our inner city environments and in the rural areas of our nation. There are several things that can be done right now to begin to increase the supply of nurses and to create the environments that will attract and retain nurses. ANA is encouraged by President Bush's budget blueprint that recommends focusing on resources, on grants that address current health care workforce challenges such as the nursing shortage. Now, the first thing that we can do is to support the expansion of programs under the Nurse Education Act reauthorized under Title VIII of the Health Professional Act of 1998. It provides for competitive grants to schools of nursing to strengthen nurse education. Unfortunately, lack of funding within the current NEA has kept the Health Services Administration from funding programs such as scholarships for disadvantaged students. The HRSA Division of Nursing reports that it will not even hold a competitive grant cycle for nurse stipend and pre-entry programs for this year due to lack of funds. The American Nurses Association supports a $25,000,000 increase to a total of $103,700,000 for NEA. Secondly, we need to find ways to increase the number of nursing faculty because the average age of the nursing faculty is 55 years. If we are going to be able to increase the number of nurses, we have to have the faculty to education them. Preparation at the Masters level could be increased through NEA by expanding the current loan repayment program. Fifty percent of all applications made for loan repayment, however, are denied due to a lack of funds. ANA supports increasing the funding for this repayment program to $10,000,000 for fiscal year 2002. Preparation of faculty at the doctoral level could also be increased to some degree through pre- and post-doctoral training grants provided by the National Institute for Nursing Research. Currently, we need to look at funding to ameliorate the shortage. We need to look at issues that address the nurses working environment. Research shows that health facilities catering to nursing needs are like magnets and can draw nurses to them. It is interesting, ANA has data that clearly indicates that when you have appropriate nurse staffing in acute care settings, there is a decrease in hospital-acquired infections, a decrease in patient falls, a decrease in pressure sores, a decrease in lengths of stay and an increase in patient satisfaction, all of which increase recovery and decrease the cost of health care. Appropriate staffing also increases nurse satisfaction with the care that they provide. Further, research has shown very clearly that the ability of nurses to have decision-making authority at the bedside and throughout the organization is one factor that enables hospitals to attract and retain nurses. Increased funding for the National Institute for Nursing Research so that research to find models to retain nurses and identify interventions that are able to achieve the desired health outcomes with the lowest cost is essential. Nursing research helps attract talented people into the profession and provides nurses with an opportunity to conduct research that makes a difference in the lives of patients. Mr. Chairman, we thank you for your support of nursing education and research. You have the opportunity to act in a way that will truly influence the health of our nation. Thank you. I would be happy to answer questions. [The information follows:] [GRAPHIC(S) NOT AVAILABLE IN TIFF FORMAT] Mr. Peterson. I would just like to run an issue by you. Last year when a group of nursing school people were visiting me, I urged them to come back and give us some ideas on how to deal with the nursing shortage. Two weeks ago they came to my office and gave me a proposal, asking for a little money. It was the following: This major nursing school from a major university in Pennsylvania is going to couple with a group of hospitals and also with a group of LPN programs and it will be a two-year nursing degree utilizing LPNs with a certain amount of floor experience. I would be interested in your reaction to that. That is sort of a difference in the trend. We have been phasing out of the two- and three-year programs that have provided a lot of our nurses to all four-year Bachelor degrees. Are we in a position where we may have to reverse that? Ms. Underwood. I do not personally agree with reversing that. The problem is, when you think about the shortage, many times people think, okay, let's get more bodies in there to give care. The reason this shortage that we are heading for, and it is going to peak around 2010, is that we have an increasing demand, because of the increasing acuity in the health care system throughout the country, we have a demand for an increase in nurses with more knowledge and experience. It is those very nurses that have more knowledge and experience would are going to be retiring and moving out of the system. So, just increasing the number of new people coming in is not going to help that. One of the things that I think is a much more attractive model that a number of State have been using, is to really encourage nurses who have their associate degree, their two-year programs, to make the articulation between the two-year and the four-year and the articulation actually between the LPN and the two-year and four-year much more smooth and to really get those people in and facilitate their moving up in terms of the nursing education. But just having more people educated is not enough if we don't change the working environments to keep people. You mentioned to another speaker about the people who are preparing for nursing and then going into other fields. While nursing is great, we need to keep them in nursing. Mr. Peterson. But I think something has happened that I didn't anticipate. I didn't realize a Bachelor degree nurse could go to school for one more year and go to almost any career that she wants. That is something I think we have to look at. I guess a lot of my hospital administrators and nursing home administrators would argue with your theory. I personally think we need to do what you want to do and do what this university wants to do. We can discuss that another day, but I think the problem is large enough that if we did all of the above, we are still going to be in trouble. Ms. Underwood. One important point that I think you did make and it came through: This is not a situation that nurses can solve by themselves, even if we are totally united as a profession. We really need to work with all of you and with the public and with the physicians and with the hospitals to address the issue. Mr. Peterson. Thank you. Mr. Regula [resuming chair]. Our next witness is Dr. William Harmon, Transplant Physician and Director of Pediatric Nephrology, Children's Hospital, Boston. We are happy to welcome you. ---------- Thursday, March 22, 2001.

Mr. Chairman, thank you for the opportunity to present testimony on behalf of the American Society of Transplantation. I am William Harmon, a transplant physician and Director of Pediatric Nephrology at Children's Hospital in Boston and Secretary-Treasurer and Chairman of the Public Policy Committee of the American Society of Transplantation. The AST, which is a professional organization that has no governmental support, was established in 1982. Our membership which now numbers more than 1,600 is comprised of physicians, surgeons and scientists engaged in the research and practice of transplantation medicine, surgery and immunobiology. The AST is the largest professional transplant organization in the United States and represents the majority of professionals in the field of transplantation. Today, there are more than 75,000 Americans whose names are on the organ transplant waiting list. During the next hour, four new names will be added to that list. By the time I get home to Boston this evening, at least 15 individuals will have died because the wait for a transplant was just too long. These patients awaiting transplantation represent a cross- section of our society. They are mothers and fathers who provide for their families. They are community and business leaders. And they are children who should havetheir entire lives ahead of them. We have made great strides in the past four decades of transplantation and we have developed extraordinary medical and surgical procedures to provide transplants to people with catastrophic organ failure. But the very success of these procedures has expanded the pool of candidates much faster than the supply of available donors. We simply don't have enough organs to transplant. The organ transplant waiting list has increased in size by approximately 380 percent in the last ten years while the number of available donors has changed very little. Each year the AST identifies the shortage of available donors as the number one problem in the field of transplantation. The Society is particularly pleased to see that Secretary Thompson was very quick to emphasize the need for enhancing organ donation in the United States. Support for organ donation is only half the battle. The other critical issue is ensuring the long-term survival and function of the transplanted organ. Over the last 40 years, transplantation of solid organs has moved from an experimental to an accepted therapy with approximately 22,000 transplants performed in the United States annually. The short-term success of this procedure has improved greatly over the last few years with recipients now enjoying more than 90 percent survival at one year. Most of this success can be attributed to research in immunosuppression that is being funded by Federal appropriations. Our better understanding of immunity and the body's response to foreign proteins has led to countless breakthroughs in many areas of medical science. The AST believes that now at the dawn of a new millennium we are on the threshold of many important scientific breakthroughs in the area of transplantation research. These include new insights into the immune mechanisms of rejection, the induction of total tolerance transplant organs, the immunologic response to animal organs and tissues, so-called Xenographs, and even bold new experiments in tissue engineering and organ development. As one example, two years ago NIAID, NIDDK and the Juvenile Diabetes Foundation collaborated in the formation of the Immune Tolerance Network, which is dedicated to the rapid development and deployment of novel clinical trials in the broad areas of organ transplantation and autoimmune diseases. Already new trials have begun and important scientific data are being collected by the ITN. AST strongly urges the subcommittee to continue its leadership in the area of biomedical research and to provide at least a 16 percent increase in funding for the NIH in fiscal year 2002. The AST supports the level of increase for NIAID and HLBI and NIDDK. To truly translate the promises of scientific discovery into better health for all Americans, the President, Congress, and the American people must continue the commitment to significant, sustained growth in funding for the NIH. Clinical and basic transplantation funding at the NIH must be increased. In particular, we recommend to Congress that the NIH give consideration to high priority initiatives of NIAID and HLBI and NIDDK, which I have provided to you in written testimony. The fruits of current research have produced many important successes in the field of transplantation. Ever more precise and powerful transplant immunosuppressive drugs have greatly increased both patient and graft survival. However, despite today's success, virtually all the transplanted organs will eventually be lost. Many challenges lie ahead of us, including the understanding of preexisting and concomitant illnesses such as cardiovascular disease, hypertension, infection, hepatitis, bone disease, diabetes and malignancies. In addition, the therapeutic strategies to induce donor- specific tolerance hold promise. The strategies to overcome Xenogenetic barriers have begun. Expansion of these programs, as well as others I have provided, will ultimately enable transplant physicians, surgeons and scientists to provide patients with a successful transplant for a failed organ for their entire natural lifetime. Therefore, I end my remarks here today by repeating AST's request that this subcommittee and Congress stay on track to double NIH's research budget by the year 2003 and permit these high priorities and initiatives to move forward. Thank you very much. Mr. Regula. Thank you. As I understand it, there is a nationwide compilation of the people who have need of a transplant so that you have to take your turn. Dr. Harmon. Yes. Every patient who is on the transplant list is known by what is known as the Organ Procurement and Transplant Network, which is funded through the NOTA legislation which was enacted in 1987. We track every patient and every donor so we know who is coming up. There are 75,000 of them waiting right now. Mr. Regula. I know. My secretary in the committee I previously chaired is waiting on lungs. I think she is number two or three at Johns Hopkins. I explored Pittsburgh and they said, well, the order of succession is the same no matter where you go because it is a nationwide program. Dr. Harmon. It is a national program. Mr. Regula. You are doing a lot of great work, though. I know my colleague, Floyd Spence, is a wonderful example of the success. He had a lung replacement maybe ten years ago. Well, thank you for coming. Dr. Harmon. Thank you very much. Mr. Regula. The next witness is Dorothy Mann, Board Member AIDS Alliance for Children, Youth and Families. ---------- Thursday, March 22, 2001. AIDS ALLIANCE FOR CHILDREN, YOUTH AND FAMILIES WITNESS DOROTHY MANN, BOARD MEMBER Ms. Mann. Good afternoon, Mr. Chairman. My name is Dorothy Mann. I am a Board member of the AIDS Alliance for Children, Youth and Families, a national organization addressing the needs of children, youth and families who are living with, affected by or at risk for HIV and AIDS. It is my honor also to serve on the CDC's HIV STD Prevention Advisory Committee. I am also the Executive Director of the Family Planning Council in Philadelphia, serving over 120,000 Title X funded family planning clients. We also provide a range of community- based HIV and STD prevention, screening and treatment services. Mr. Chairman, I am here today because our nation is becoming complacent about AIDS. How many new HIV infections do you think we have in this country every year? In 2001, 40,000 people will become newly infected with HIV. Half of these infections will occur in people under 25. That means 100 people in this country will become infected with HIV today and again tomorrow. Can we prevent HIV from infecting 40,000 people in America? Yes. But it will take bolder leadership, increased funding and smarter allocation of resources. The Ryan White Care Act, which was reauthorized by Congress in the year 2000, is the most critical Federal program dedicated to people living with HIV and AIDS. Today I will focus on Title IV of the Care Act, which provides funding for medical care, social services and access to research for children, youth, women and families. Simply put, Title IV is a success story. It has enabled communities to respond quickly and efficiently to the HIV epidemic. Since the science became clear about the role of AZT in reducing mother-to-child HIV transmission, Title IV grantees, including my own, have played a major role in the remarkable steady decline in the number of infants born with HIV in this country. CDC estimates that fewer than 200 infants were born with HIV last year. But even one baby born with this disease is too many. As the number of HIV-infected women of childbearing age rises, reducing perionatal transmission becomes more challenging and expensive. Despite the successes of Title IV, currently funded at $65,000,000, much more needs to be done. The President's budget calls for a four percent increase in discretionary spending. But with 40,000 new infections each year, we need to increase spending on Federal AIDS programs much more than four percent or people will die. If funding for the Federal AIDS program does not keep pace, individuals, families and entire communities across the country will continue to be decimated by this terrible disease. The AIDS Alliance recommends a total funding of $83,000,000 for Title IV for fiscal year 2002. This is a 28 percent increase over 2001, which is the same rate we received this year. As you know, the Congressional Black Caucus Minority AIDS initiative has provided critical increase in Federal AIDS programs reflecting the disproportionate impact of HIV and AIDS on communities of color. Eighty-four percent of the clients served by Title IV are people of color. AIDS Alliance would be happy to provide additional information to this committee as you consider the Congressional Black Caucus funding for 2002. It goes without saying that HIV is spread from an infected person to an uninfected person. Thus far we have focused HIV prevention efforts almost exclusively on uninfected people. We have largely ignored those who are already infected. Mounting evidence suggests that as people with HIV are living longer and more active lives, they are more likely to engage in unprotected sex. Let me be clear. I am not advocating laws or policies that criminalize or stigmatize HIV-positive people or their behavior. I am talking about interventions that help HIV-positive people reduce their risk behavior and protect their uninfected partners. What can be done? We must work to break down the walls between HIV prevention and care programs. As you appropriate funding to agencies such as HRSA, CDC, and SMSA, you must encourage coordination to the greatest extent possible to reduce barriers between these agencies and between prevention and care. It is estimated that CDC needs an additional $300 million each year to implement their new strategic plan to reduce HIV new infections to 20,000. Scientific evidence should be the basis for HIV infection policies. We know, for example, that needle exchange programs work and do not increase drug use. Yet, we still have Federal restrictions on their funding. We need to take politics out of science. Let me leave you with a final thought: Reversing the nation's growing complacency about AIDS is a daunting task, but we must do more, much more, than simply prevent an escalation in the rate of new infections. It is intolerable. If we had 40,000 American casualties in a war, would we find that acceptable? I hardly think so. We have to do more because if we don't, it will only get worse. Thank you. [GRAPHIC(S) NOT AVAILABLE IN TIFF FORMAT] Mr. Regula. Our next witness is Emily Sheketoff, Executive Director, American Library Association. ---------- Thursday, March 22, 2001. AMERICAN LIBRARY ASSOCIATION WITNESS EMILY SHEKETOFF, EXECUTIVE DIRECTOR Ms. Sheketoff. Thank you, Chairman Regula. We wish to thank you for your support for our libraries in the past. We look forward to working with you on behalf of America's libraries in your first year as Chairman of this subcommittee. I know that you are familiar with libraries, as a result of your experiences as a teacher, and as the father of a librarian at Western Reserve in Hudson, Ohio. I would like to talk to you about the crucial benefits that Federal support brings to the libraries. Mr. Regula. You did not know that my wife started the National First Ladies Library. Ms. Sheketoff. Yes, sir, and I have a terrific magazine article with a good picture of that for you. [Laughter.] So I tried hard. On Federal support for libraries, we would like to talk about two key National goals: outreach to those for whom libraries service requires extra effort or special materials, such as individuals with disabilities; and mechanisms to identify, preserve, and share library and information resources across institutional or governmental boundaries through technology. The library community is capable of astonishing creativity and expertise in support of National goals such as revitalizing the economy, having children start school ready to learn, and developing literate, informed adults. Oftentimes, one of the few sources of funding for innovation available to libraries is Federal funding. It is estimated that library programs generate from three to four dollars for every Federal dollar invested. Mr. Chairman, our new President has said on many occasions, ``We must leave no child behind.'' I can tell you that America's libraries believe that we must lead no reader behind. That is why we feel so strongly that library programs need additional Federal funding. We need to ensure equitable access and participation of our Nation's readers to library activities and opportunities in their communities. We need to support our libraries continuing efforts to keep pace with the rapidly changing information technology environment. We need to recognize the important contributions that libraries make to the social, civic, and educational health of their communities. Like many schools, libraries often service as the hubs of their communities, and provide important services, training in technology, and opportunities for life long learning, particularly in traditionally under-served areas. Recently, the library community corroborated on developing a draft for the reauthorization of the Library Services and Technology Act, which will expire in fiscal year 2002. We are seeking to increase the authorization level to $500 million. As you know, this represents a significant expansion in the Federal Government's commitment to the support of our Nation's libraries. Today, we request your support for fiscal year 2002 of a down-payment of $350 million for library programs authorized under LSTA. With this increase, more libraries could expand their services to include technology training and literacy programs that enable students to achieve the success and education, and programs for families, who may not have not used libraries before. Library programs for young children encourage pre-reading skills and develop a love for reading. Mr. Regula. We will have to wrap it up. I am going to have to go vote here. You are preaching to the choir. Ms. Sheketoff. Great, well, I just wanted to give you an example in Ohio. In this year, Ohio received $5.5 million. If the state distribution was increased to $350 million, Ohio would get about $11 million. This would enable Ohio to complete the school library connections to the statewide Ohio network. In 1999, the libraries of Ohio requested $7.5 million in LSTA funding, but received only $2.9 million. So you see, the need is great and the funds available can stretch only so far. We are also asking that this subcommittee support education Title 6, the Block Grant that goes to libraries, at least at the $400 million level. As you know, school library materials are only one option of this block grant. Unfortunately, less and less of the funds are used for school library materials. As a result, many school libraries have old, outdated, and inaccurate material on their shelves. Research shows that a good library media program in the school is an excellent predictor of student achievement. In summary, an increase in LSTA funding to $350 million would allow more of the 16,000 libraries to begin to provide Internet training and information access services to families, adult learners, the small business sector, and the communities who need them. Thank you very much, Mr. Chairman. [The information follows:] [GRAPHIC(S) NOT AVAILABLE IN TIFF FORMAT] Mr. Regula. Thank you, and they are very important. I understand that. We, of course, have constraints on what we have available. Ms. Sheketoff. With a real dedication to education, the library component is really critical. Mr. Regula. Well, we hope that we get enough adequate funding from OMB. Thank you for coming today. I regret that I have to get over to there and vote or we will run out of time. Ms. Sheketoff. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. Mr. Regula. The committee will be in recess for about 10 minutes. [Recess.] Mr. Regula. We will reconvene. Our next witness is Mr. Richard Kase. ---------- Thursday, March 22, 2001. ARTHRITIS FOUNDATION NORTHEAST OHIO CHAPTER WITNESS RICHARD D. KASE, CHAIRMAN, CANTON OHIO ADVISORY BOARD, ARTHRITIS FOUNDATION NORTHEAST OHIO CHAPTER Mr. Kase. Good afternoon, Mr. Chairman and members of the subcommittee, which are few and far between at this stage of the game. Mr. Regula. Yes, that is true. Mr. Kase. It is truly an honor to speak to you, one of Canton's favorite sons. I want to thank you for the opportunity to speak today about how Congress can continue to play an important role in helping improve the quality of life for the 43 million Americans living with arthritis, including the 300,000 children living with the disease. Specifically, I would like to thank the subcommittee for its leadership in supporting funding increases to support arthritis research at the National Institute of Arthritis, and musculoskeletal skeletal and skin diseases and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention's Arthritis Program. As I said, my name is Richard Kase. I am from Canton, Ohio. I am a business man and a volunteer. I am here today in my role with Arthritis Foundation of Northeast Ohio as the Volunteer Chair of the Canton Area Advisory Board. I am also one of the 43 million Americans living with this painful and oftentimes debilitating disease. I was first diagnosed with osteoarthritis in 1992, at the age of 40. Due to osteoarthritis, I have had five knee operations and one back surgery. While osteoarthritis limits my daily activities, simply climbing stairs is extremely painful. I consider myself fortunate. For today, there is new hope for the millions of Americans with arthritis. We have new, more effective therapies to prevent pain and disability, thanks to the Federal investment in research. With the CDC's arthritis program, we are reaching out and empowering millions of Americans to help them take steps to improve their quality of life. Mr. Chairman, 95,000 persons living in Ohio's 16th Congressional District have arthritis. One of those individuals is Tiffany Kenyan. Tiffany was diagnosed with juvenile rheumatoid arthritis at the age of four. Every day is a challenge, as she faces the pain, physical disabilities, and psychological trauma brought on by the disease. Now a teenager, Tiffany has been unable to do many of the activities that most of her friends take for granted. However, thanks to new therapies, early diagnosis in the treatment and the support of family, she plans golf, dances, and swims when possible. She may have arthritis, but it does not have her. Like me, Tiffany has been a beneficiary of the research investments in the National Institutes of Health by this subcommittee. Our lives have been made better, thanks to a new generation of treatments and therapies, for the many serious forms of the disease. Ongoing growth in the NIH budget will provide the National Institute for Arthritis and Musculoskeletal and Skin Diseases the resources to support critical research ranging from osteoarthritis to lupus to juvenile rheumatoid arthritis. To meet this pressing national need, the Foundation urges the members of the subcommittee to continue the doubling of the NIH budget, within five years, and provide $462 million, as part of the NIH's fiscal year 2002 appropriations for NIAMs. With this in mind, the Arthritis Foundation strongly believes this investment must be matched with a similar investment in public health programs, designed to ensure that all Americans benefit from our new understandings about the disease, effective self-management strategies, and improved treatment options. As a person with arthritis, I am proud that Congress has recognized the importance of this national effort by establishing and funding the National Arthritis Action Plan, which is a public health strategy. This innovative public health strategy is being implemented by the CDC, in partnership with state health departments across America. The Arthritis Foundation, and its 55 state-based chapters. Among our goals are improving the scientific information base on arthritis; researching how we can better prevent arthritis; and encouraging more individuals with arthritis to seek early diagnosis and treatment, to reduce pain and disability. Due to this subcommittee's support and leadership, the CDC was provided with $12 million as part of the fiscal year 2001 budget, to move forward with this vision. To date, 37 states have been awarded funds to begin executing the plan. Based on the enthusiasm of our state partners, the Foundation's commitment to invest its resources, and the pressing need to address the growing public health problems associated with arthritis, we strongly encourage the members of the subcommittee to provide the CDC with $24.5 million, as part of the fiscal year 2002 budget, to help establish state-based arthritis programs in all states in territories. This modest investment will help us meet the challenge of arthritis, and lead to a day when arthritis is no longer the leading cause of disability in the U.S., for individuals 18 years of age and older. It will help lead to a day when arthritis no longer costs our economy $82.5 billion a year in medical care and related expenses, including lost productivity. Congressman Regula, for generations, we have labored under the many myths surrounding arthritis. Arthritis was an inevitable part of the aging process. There were no effective treatment options, apart from taking a few aspirin. Exercise was harmful for individuals with arthritis. Children do not get arthritis was another myth. It cannot be prevented. Today, we stand ready with the necessary tools, expertise and energy, to shatter these myths, and capitalize on the fruits of our research to help improve the lives of Americans living with arthritis. On behalf of the 43 million Americans living with arthritis, I appreciate the opportunity to speak to you today, and urge the members of the subcommittee to help us win the war against arthritis by supporting funding for these critical Federal Programs. It has been a pleasure and honor to testify to you today on behalf of all of the arthritis victims. Thank you. [The information follows:] [GRAPHIC(S) NOT AVAILABLE IN TIFF FORMAT] Mr. Regula. You are saying that there have been some very substantial progress, though? Mr. Kase. There has been tremendous progress, relative to new drugs that have reached the market; great progress relative to public awareness and prevention. Mr. Regula. Do the drugs just relieve the pain, or do they actually affect some degree of cure or change? Mr. Kase. It is really a supplement to other non-steroidal drugs, just to relieve the pain. I, for one, have been on Vioxx, which is a new medication. You take one a day, as opposed to the 12 Advil that I was taking every day. Mr. Regula. I see Vioxx advertised. Does it work pretty effectively? Mr. Kase. For me, it has worked very well. For some people, it does not work quite as well, and it has some side effects for other individuals. But for me, it was a very good drug, and is a very good drug. Mr. Regula. Thank you for coming. I know it is a substantial trip here from Canton, Ohio. Mr. Kase. But to come to see you, Congressman, it was well worth it. [Laughter.] Mr. Regula. You had better reserve judgment until we get the bill out and see. Mr. Kase. Well, we will talk about that back in Canton.Thank you. [Laughter.] Mr. Regula. Well, we are going to do what we can for all of these things. It depends what we have available in the allocation of funds, which is beyond our control. Our next witness is Dr. Paul Mintz, Professor of Pathology and Internal Medicine, University of Virginia Health System. ---------- Thursday, March 22, 2001. AMERICAN ASSOCIATION OF BLOOD BANKS WITNESS PAUL MINTZ, M.D., PROFESSOR OF PATHOLOGY AND INTERNAL MEDICINE, UNIVERSITY OF VIRGINIA HEALTH SYSTEM; AMERICAN ASSOCIATION OF BLOOD BANKS Dr. Mintz. Good afternoon, Mr. Chairman. I appreciate the opportunity very much to come here today. I am Professor of Pathology and Internal Medicine at the University of Virginia. Today, I am speaking to you on behalf of the American Association of Blood Banks, the professional society for approximately 8,000 individuals involved in blood banking and transfusion medicine; and about 2,000 institutional members, including community blood centers, the American Red Cross, and hospital-based services. Mr. Regula. I understand they are having trouble getting people to donate. Is that true? Dr. Mintz. That is true, sir. There really has been intermittent blood shortages. Of course, fewer and fewer people are eligible to donate, as restrictions are put into place. Mr. Regula. Yes, well, mad cow disease has put a six month waiting period on anyone in England, as I understand it. Dr. Mintz. It is anyone who actually has lived in England, between 1980 and 1996, for six months, cannot be a blood donor, indefinitely, in the United States. Mr. Regula. Indefinitely? Dr. Mintz. That is correct. That actually is also going to apply now in France, for people who have been in France for 10 years or Portugal for 10 years, based on a new recommendation. So there are fewer and fewer eligible blood donors in this country; that is correct. AABB has long recognized the critical role of the National Institutes of Health, and especially the National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute, and other public health agencies that they have played in ensuring that patients have access to the best possible transfusion therapies. In fact, today, the Nation's blood supply is safer than it has ever been. Each year, over 26 million units of blood are transfused into millions of individuals. With enhanced Federal support for research, transfusion medicine promises new lifesaving therapies, as well as an even safer blood supply. We strongly encourage to support the following research initiatives. First, ongoing Federal support for blood supply data is needed. Blood safety and availability are inseparable requirements for ensuring optimal patient care. The safest possible blood component cannot benefit the patient if it is not readily available. The number and duration of seasonal blood shortages are increasing. An aging population and more complex medical procedures have resulted in an increasing demand for blood. In order to predict and prepare for possible shortages, we need reliable data regarding both collection and utilization of all types of blood components. In 1996, recognizing the significant need for blood supply data, the AABB founded the National Blood Data Resource Center, the NBDRC. In prior years, NHLBI had funded this data collection. However, when this Federal funding ceased, there was a clear vacuum in public and private support for national blood data collection. The AABB is very proud of the fine work that the NBDRC has produced, including its important biennial nationwide blood collection and utilization survey. In fiscal year 2000, the NHLBI agreed to fund the collection of certain monthly supply statistics. Unfortunately, ongoing support from the NHLBI for blood supply data is not continuing in fiscal year 2001. The AABB is very concerned that so long as no specific Federal agency is responsible for supporting critical data collection regarding the blood supply, we will not be able to generate necessary long-term information. Policymakers, including Congress, cannot make sound decisions affecting patients lives, absent reliable data. Therefore, the AABB strongly urges Congress to designate an appropriate office within the Public Health Service, to be responsible for Federal support of blood supply data collection. In addition, Congress should appropriate sufficient dollars to support long-term efforts, like those of the National Blood Data Resource Center, to collect,analyze, and distribute data about the Nation's blood supply. In short, we need to know who is donating the blood, what kind of components are being collected, and where it is going. Then we can plan responsibly regarding donor selection criteria, and patient initiatives. Mr. Regula. I assume you work with the American Red Cross, since they seem to take the lead. Dr. Mintz. Yes, that is correct. The American Red Cross is responsible for about half the blood collection in this country, and then other community blood centers are responsible for the other half. We, in the AABB, actually work with all of these centers. A second initiative that I would like to suggest is research regarding non-infectious risks of transfusion. The AABB urges the subcommittee to support additional Federal efforts to enhance the safety of blood transfusion. In recent decades, the United States invested significantly in reducing transfusion risks associated with infectious diseases, as you well know. This investment has paid off dramatically. When I first taught medical students in 1979, I told them there was one percent risk of acquiring what is not hepatitis C from a blood transfusion. That risk is now about one in a million. The same kind of statistics apply to HIV. The risk of acquiring such an infection from a blood transfusion has actually been reduced about 10,000 fold in the last 20 years. Mr. Regula. So you have better control. Dr. Mintz. We have better testing, better donor screening, and also viral inactivation of many blood components. Mr. Regula. How do we help? Dr. Mintz. Actually, I think that right now, Federal funding should be directed toward non-infectious risks. There is actually about a 100 fold increase in risk of patient who is receiving a blood transfusion right now, getting the wrong unit, than there is of getting an infection. There has not been an investment in the processes to assure appropriate safeguards in getting the right unit to the right patient. Mr. Regula. Where would that investment be; CDC, NIH? Dr. Mintz. I think it would be in developing a clinical trials network, that would emphasize research in the non- infectious risks of transfusion, including providing processes to get the right unit to the right patient, and other non- infectious risks, such as immuno-modulation. Mr. Regula. Well, thank you, and we will put your testimony in the record. Dr. Mintz. Thank you very much. [The information follows:] [GRAPHIC(S) NOT AVAILABLE IN TIFF FORMAT] Mr. Regula. We have two young ladies here, and one of them from my district. They are in the Presidential classroom, and this is the real world, young ladies. What we are doing in here will touch your lives, because we do all the research on medical, and something that is discovered over the next many months and years may save your life. Likewise, we do education. Of course, I am sure that is important to both of you. So we are happy to welcome you. As soon as we get finished up here, we will go back and get a picture with you in the office. Okay, next we have Kathryn Peppe, President of the Association of Maternal and Child Health Programs. ---------- Thursday, March 22, 2001. ASSOCIATION OF MATERNAL AND CHILD HEALTH PROGRAMS WITNESS KATHRYN PEPPE, PRESIDENT, ASSOCIATION OF MATERNAL AND CHILD HEALTH PROGRAMS Ms. Peppe. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. I am Kathy Peppe, President of Association of Maternal and Child and Health Programs. I am also the Chief of the Division of Family and Community Health Services at the Ohio Department of Health. That is Ohio's maternal and health program. Thank you for the opportunity to testify today. We at the Association of Maternal Child and Health Programs really appreciate the subcommittee's interest and support of Maternal and Child Health Services Block Grant, and all of the programs that are supported with that funding source in our states. For over 65 years, programs authorized under Title 5 of the Social Security Act, the Maternal and Child Health Programs Block Grant, have helped fulfill our Nation's strong commitment to improving the health of all mothers and children. Title 5 is the foundation of our Nation's public health system. It continues today to watch over and promote the health of mothers, children, and youth, while serving as a safety net program for all of our country's high risk and most vulnerable residents. State maternal and child health programs funded by the Block Grant have demonstrated their ability to adapt through decades of change. We have had to respond to the emergence of new diseases, the discovery of new vaccines and treatment methods, and the changing health care financing and delivery systems across the country. Yet Congress has remained committed to this public health program, because we have been accountable for what we have been doing. We have provided proven preventive health programs with demonstrated and measurable results. Grants to the State Health Departments are used to help locally-determined needs that are consistent with the national healthy people goals for fiscal year 2010 or 2000, so on. This includes reducing maternal and infant mortality, helping children with disabilities function to their full potential, and educating children and adolescents about how to reduce risky behaviors and learn healthy lifestyles. The Maternal and Child Health Block Grant encompasses lots more than just moms and babies. Children with special health care needs and teenagers are a major focus for our programs. Maternal and Child Health Programs ultimately address the health needs of families. The flexibility of the Block Grant gives us the chance to develop innovative programs and services that go beyond health care needs to address individual specific needs and help people access needed health care services. Last year, Congress raised the authorization level for the Title 5 Program to $850 million. While funding for other public health programs has been expanded over the past five years, Title 5's funding has remained relatively flat in the past decade. So the increased authorization was desperately needed and comes at an ideal time for us in states. The MCH programs have just completed a five year needs assessment. As a result, all of the states and territories are poised to move forward to address their unmet health needs, as soon as additional funding is appropriated. Each state knows precisely how it would allocate its resources to meet the priority needs for maternal and child health populations. In Ohio, we could use additional funds to expand our child and family health services clinic programs. These are clinics that provide primary health care for pregnant women, child and infants, who otherwise would go without health care. We could implement a statewide system of child fatality review. We could offer additional children with special health care needs access to the services of specialists around the state. We could put preventive dental sealants on the teeth of more children to reduce cavities. I want to share with you a couple of stories about real people, who we have touched in Ohio. Anna is someone who is from Stark County, your home. She is a pregnant 31 year old woman with a history of premature delivery, closely spaced pregnancies, and late entry into prenatal care; plus asthma, tobacco use, drug use, homelessness, and three of her four children are in permanent placement. Fortunately, Ohio's Title 5 Program had what Anna needed. The Ohio Infant Mortality Reduction Initiative paired a trained outreach worker from the local neighborhood, where these high risk, low income pregnant women, who are either uninsured or under-insured. The outreach worker helped this mom, and subsequently her baby, get into care and stay in care, as well as meet other basic needs. Thanks to the outreach program, Anna has her own apartment today. She has completed parenting classes and attends substance abuse treatment programs. The best news is that she delivered a healthy beautiful and drug free baby girl, she regained custody of one of her other children. This is a victory for Ohio. In its recent needs assessment, Ohio Title 5 Program identified the reduction of infant mortality, particularly for those with disabilities, as one of our top 10 health issues. It is an excellent example of how assessment of local needs can translate into effective programs. Let me just close by saying that we are urging you to remember the faces of people who are actually touched by block grants in the states and their stories like Anna's. There are hundreds of thousands of other stories that we could share with you similar to these. Please fully fund the Title 5 Program at $850 million. Mr. Regula. It sounds like you are having a lot of success and that is what we like to hear on these programs. Ms. Peppe. Yes, thank you. I would be happy to answer any questions. Mr. Regula. Thank you. [The information follows:] [GRAPHIC(S) NOT AVAILABLE IN TIFF FORMAT] Mr. Regula. Our next witness is Carl Suter, Director of Vocational Rehabilitation Programs, Council of State Administrators; welcome. ---------- Thursday, March 22, 2001. COUNCIL OF STATE ADMINISTRATORS OF VOCATIONAL REHABILITATION WITNESS CARL SUTER, DIRECTOR, COUNCIL OF STATE ADMINISTRATORS OF VOCATIONAL REHABILITATION Mr. Suter. Good afternoon, Mr. Chairman, I am Carl Suter. I am the Director of the Illinois Rehabilitation Agency of Vocation Rehabilitation Services. I also am a member of the Council of State Administrators of Vocational Rehabilitation. We are a Federal and State partnership, and have been a partnership for over 80 years in helping individuals with disabilities become employed. The Rehabilitation Act and the Vocational Rehabilitation Program is the cornerstone of our Nation's commitment to serving individuals with disabilities and helping them to become employed. Our program, every year, get thousands of folks into jobs. One of the things that I am here to tell you today, is that even though I know Congress had intended in the past to give our program cost of living increases every year, states like Ohio and Illinois are not receiving those cost of living increases. For example, in Illinois, we received less than one-half of one percent of an increase for cost of living. Mr. Regula. Do you think that other states are getting it, and you are not; or is it across the board? Mr. Suter. Well, because of the way the formula works, in Illinois and Ohio, the formula has had an adverse impact on us being able to get what the COLA, the overall COLA that you had for the program. In Illinois, we got less than one-half of one percent. I think that Ohio got less than two percent of an increase. This comes at a time in which, when you would look at Louis Harris pole and other National surveys, we know that 70 percent of people of disabilities are not employed. Yet, two thirds of those wish to work. Individuals between the ages of 18 and 60 are not working, and yet they want to work. Our program has many pressures on it. The special education program, is a great program, a sister program, that helps many youths with disabilities get great services. Now as those youth begin to come to adulthood, and they come to vocational rehabilitation, that adds additional pressures to our program to serve them. I would like to tell you about one youth in Illinois to kind of illustrate this point. Rick is a young man with Down's Syndrome in the Chicago area. We started working with him when he was a junior in high school. We helped him get a job after school and on weekends. When Rick graduated last summer, he told us that he did not want to sit at home, like some of his friends were going to be doing. He wanted to work. He wanted a real job. He did not want to have to get $550 each month from SSI. He wanted to work. We got Rick a job working in a hospital. He is earning over $9 an hour. He is getting full benefits. There are thousands of Ricks in this country. They want to work, and they turn to vocational rehabilitation services for the kinds of training technology that they need. There are many pressures on our program. The Olmstead decision is another one, where folks are coming out of institutions and now into the community. Not only do they want to live independently; they want to work. With TANF, we have had great success in this country in getting folks off of TANF. But what is left now is the hard core of that population. Many of those, in fact, have disabilities and they are coming to us for vocational rehabilitation services. We have enough funds to only serve one in twenty eligible individuals with disabilities; one in twenty. Yet, the data shows that there are thousands and thousands, hundreds of thousands of folks who need our services. The Rehabilitation Services Administration tells us that in fiscal year 1999, we spent $2.2 billion on services for this population. We serve nationally over 1.2 million people and got 230,000 of those folks into competitive jobs. Sir, let me leave you with one recommendation. Our Council of State Administrators of Vocational Rehabilitation would like for us to be able to have an increase that will allow us to serve these hundreds of thousands of folks who come to us. We are asking for a 10 percent increase in funding, about 6.5 percent over the regular CPI that we would normally bereceiving. That equates to about $240 million. Mr. Regula. Well, you really have two problems. You need to change the formula, because I think it penalizes Illinois and Ohio; and secondly, of course, to get more money into the program. Mr. Suter. Right. Mr. Regula. Thank you for coming. Mr. Suter. Thank you very much. Mr. Regula. I know that it is a good program. I am familiar with it back home. Mr. Suter. Thank you. [The information follows:] [GRAPHIC(S) NOT AVAILABLE IN TIFF FORMAT] Mr. Regula. Our next witness is Steve Korn, President of National Council of Social Security Management Associations. ---------- Thursday, March 22, 2001. NATIONAL COUNCIL OF SOCIAL SECURITY MANAGEMENT ASSOCIATIONS, INC. WITNESS STEVE KORN, PRESIDENT, NATIONAL COUNCIL OF SOCIAL SECURITY MANAGEMENT ASSOCIATIONS, INC. Mr. Korn. Chairman Regula, my name is Steve Korn and I am here as President of the National Council of Social Security Management Associations, an organization of over 3,000 managers and supervisors who work in SSA's field offices and telephone centers. Thank you for giving me the opportunity to come before you today to talk about the budget needs of the Social Security Administration, from the perspective of the front-line managers and supervisors who are directly responsible for delivering service to the American public. Over the past two decades, SSA has witnessed a dramatic reduction in staff. For example, the local Canton, Ohio field office lost seven positions just in the past six years. In addition, over the past five years, supervisory staff in SSA's local field offices and telephone centers have been reduced by more than 1,000 positions. Accommodations of dramatic reductions in both overall and supervisory staff, has resulted in a critical situation whereby the level and quality of service provided to the public is in severe jeopardy. A little over a year ago, the Bipartisan Social Security Advisory Board warned of the need to bolster resources in the Social Security field offices. The board found that staff resources in offices all over the country have declined to the point where their ability to provide quality service to the community is threatened. The board reaffirmed these findings in an updated report issued earlier this month. To better quantify the findings of the Social Security Advisory Board, our organization conducted a survey of field office management throughout the country. The responses which were received from managers in over 50 percent of all field offices confirm that services were below acceptable levels in three critical areas: telephone service, the quality of work products, and in employee training. They also found that customer waiting times are increasing. A copy of these findings has been sent to this committee, as well as to each Congressional office. While the statistics of the results are revealing, I thought it was interesting to share a couple of the more than 64 pages of comments that we received from these front-line managers. For example, regarding telephone service, a manager in the Chicago region, which includes the State of Ohio writes the following: ``We need more incoming lines. However, we do not have the staff to cover the additional lines.'' Another manager offered this chilling story. A physician contacted us in response to a representative pay issue. He wrote the manager saying he was on hold for over an hour. Fortunately, he had a speaker phone, which enabled him to take care of his patients while waiting for us to answer. Hedisconnected the call before we ever spoke to him. In his letter he stated, ``You call me from now on, because I will never contact Social Security again.'' I wish I could tell you that this was simply an isolated incident, but unfortunately, it really is not. Another Chicago region manager wrote, ``As we take the SSA measures to the community, we have generated more work for the staff. We say we are ambassadors of the agency, and cultivate good relationships with neighborhood. We then make our public wait longer to be served, and have insufficient staff to validate what we went out preached.'' Another manager writes, ``Quality has suffered here to a great extent as the result of the loss of front-line supervisors. These were the people with the hands-on experience. They reviewed the work. They addressed individual employee shortcomings. They saw to the technical needs of the employees. Now they are gone.'' If these current service delivery and quality problems were not bad enough, Social Security will face additional challenges over the coming decade, as the large baby boom generation begins to file for disability and retirement benefits, at the same time that the agency faces its own wave of retirements. For example, Quinzella Hobbs, who is the manager of the Canton Field Office, reports that right now, 29 percent of her staff has both the age and required years of services to retire today. It generally takes replacement hires three years to become fully productive. In the face of these current and future challenges, NCSSA recommends the following. First, SSA's budget should reflect the immediate need to increase front-line staffing in SSA's field offices by 5,000 full-time equivalents, a 17.5 percent increase. Second, SSA's field offices and telephone centers should be allowed to fill front-line supervisory positions, based on the need to maintain adequate levels of quality training and customer service. Third, SSA's administrative budget should be removed from the discretionary spending caps, along with SSA's program budget, allowing Congress to allocate sufficient funds to SSA, based on demonstrated service needs. As an independent agency, in accordance with Section 104(b) of the Social Security Act, Social Security submitted its own fiscal year 2000 budget to this committee. Social Security requested $8.11 billion, which is $438 million more than was requested by the new Administration. The additional funds will allow SSA to begin to address many of the problems identified. For example, new employees can be hired now, so they can be trained and up to speed before we lose our experienced employees. Certainly, we would urge you to support this higher level of funding. Mr. Chairman, I thank you again for inviting my testimony. I am certainly happy to answer any questions that you might have. [The information follows:] [GRAPHIC(S) NOT AVAILABLE IN TIFF FORMAT] Mr. Regula. Well, thank you, and I am aware of some of the problems because, of course, we look to our local Social Security Office to help with constituent problems. I have hired a couple of your people away. That is probably one of the reasons that you have a shortage. [Laughter.] They are good people, and they are well trained. It works out well for us. But we are aware of the problem, and we, of course, have the report that was submitted. Thank you for coming. Where are you located? Mr. Korn. I am located in Vallejo, California, Northern California. Again, the problems we face are very similar to what is faced in your state. Mr. Regula. Is automation helping you? Mr. Korn. Automation is essential. Quite honestly, without automation, we would be much worse. The problem is, there is not enough automation out there to address the problems. Mr. Regula. Somebody has to put the material in to automate. Mr. Korn. And there has to be people to use what is out there. So it is a combination. It is not one answer. Mr. Regula. Well, thanks for coming; you have made a long trip here. Mr. Korn. Yes, I have. Mr. Regula. We appreciate it. Mr. Korn. I am happy to do it. Mr. Regula. Do not be too distressed that we do not have other committee members here. You have got the most important people here, and that is the staff. Mr. Korn. That is absolute true, and we have the Chairman. Thank you very much. Mr. Regula. You are welcome. Our next witness is Mr. John Black, General Counsel, National High School Federation. ---------- Thursday, March 22, 2001. NATIONAL HIGH SCHOOL FEDERATION WITNESS JOHN BLACK, GENERAL COUNSEL, NATIONAL HIGH SCHOOL FEDERATION Mr. Black. Thank you. Good afternoon, and I appreciate the opportunity to give the keynote address here today. Actually, Dr. Martin and I are both from Indiana. Given the success, or lack thereof, of the Indiana University basketball team, I guess we are just having one of those weeks. Mr. Regula. Well, your former coach was from my district. Mr. Black. Oh, really? Mr. Regula. Yes, we keep chairs away up there. [Laughter.] Please continue. Mr. Black. Well, I am here on behalf of the National High School Federation, which is an organization comprised of all 50 state associations and the District of Columbia, and one of the members is Clara Mascara in Ohio High School Athletic Association. We have approximately seven million young people who play under the rules that we write each year in 17 sports. One of them is right here, and maybe both of them. We have got a couple of high school athletes there. We have a concern that is coming up. It factors into the idea that a lot of teachers who used to be coaches are going on to other things; either they are getting tired of coaching or they run for Congress. So we wind up with a situation where instead of having experienced educators providing coaching to young people, we wind up, particularly at the lower level, the JV and freshmen and sophomore teams and in middle schools, with a lot parents and a lot of volunteers from the community, who may know something about ``Xs and Os,'' but are not necessarily experienced in the teaching skills that help them instill what we like to think of are some of the advantages of participation in inter-scholastic activities. The CDC has pointed lately very much at childhood obesity, and Health and Human Services has talked a lot about the benefits of extra-curricular participation, in terms of staying in school, better grades, lower team pregnancies, lower incidents of drug use. So we think we are doing a good thing. It costs about three percent of the total budget for education to take care of athletics and extra-curricular activities. However, we are winding up with all these coaches who really need to have a little bit of extra help, in terms of how to take advantage of what we call the teachable moments that come in the course of teaching. We have a program that has worked for about 10 years. It is the Coaches Education Program. It is very inexpensive. It costs about $40 per person. It is focused on people who are not trained educators. Our concern is that although we are giving it to about 25,000 people a year, that is only a drop in the bucket. We have got an awful lot more coaches out there, and there is a very high turnover. So we are thinking that it might make some sense to try a model program, where we make it available, and particularly available to inner city in situations, where the $40 to come as a volunteer coach may seem as a real impediment. We would like to try that on an experimental basis in a couple of states, to just see if it works and see if it helps. Mr. Regula. Have you put your suggestion in your statement? Mr. Black. We have. Mr. Regula. We will get a chance to look at it. Mr. Black. Okay. Mr. Regula. And we appreciate your being here. Mr. Black. Thank you very much. [The information follows:] [GRAPHIC(S) NOT AVAILABLE IN TIFF FORMAT] Mr. Regula. All right, our last witness today is Dr. William Martin, President and CEO of Indiana University Health Care, and President of the American Thoracic Society, and Board Member of the American Lung Association. Tell us your story. ---------- Thursday, March 22, 2001. THE AMERICAN LUNG ASSOCIATION AND THE AMERICAN THORACIC SOCIETY WITNESS WILLIAM J. MARTIN, II, MD, THE AMERICAN LUNG ASSOCIATION AND THE AMERICAN THORACIC SOCIETY Dr. Martin. Well, I realize that I am the last witness of the last day. I would first like to thank you and your members. This is our only chance to put forth the story for our patients and the scientific community, and we thank you very much for this opportunity. I am a pulmonary and critical care physician at Indian University and, as you noted, President of the American Thoracic Society and a Board Member of the American Lung Association. In my brief time before you today, I would like to raise three issues. The first is the rapidly disappearing physician scientist. That is not simply physician scientists in lung disease, but in all of health related science. Physician scientists are essential to the research enterprise, because they link bench research to the patient's bedside. However, fewer and fewer physicians are devoting their time and talents to research. There are several mechanisms at NIH that they could use to address these problems, but perhaps most importantly, Congress needs to address why physicians choose not to pursue science. Invariably, this is because of the overwhelming debt from medical school, which you have earlier today, that can average anywhere from $75,000 to $150,000. Physicians with large debts often leave their research careers behind, and pursue private practice, where debts can be more easily paid off. The next generation of physician scientists should not be selected on the basis of whether or not they have debts from medical school. Last year, Congress passed legislation that provided debt relief for physicians who do clinical research. We would request that Congress support expansion of this program to include all areas of biomedical science. If enacted, Congress would ensure that the quality of the scientist, and not his or her financial background, would determine the next generation of physician scientists. Mr. Regula. Was this debt relief on student loans, Federal supported loans? Dr. Martin. Yes, it is for medical school. It was part of an omnibus package last year. This was specifically the Clinical Research Enhancement Act. The second issue that I wish to bring to your attention is that of chronic obstructed pulmonary disease, or COPD. COPD is a collection of airway disorders, including emphysema, that are progressive and fatal. An estimated 16 million Americans have COPD, and another 16 million Americans are undiagnosed. COPD affects twice as many Americans as diabetes, and is the Nation's fourth leading cause of death. In the April issue of ``Scientific American,'' which I was just reading on my way here, it is noted that the mortality rate for heart disease and stroke for the past 20 years has declined by more than 50 percent. In contrast, in this same article, the mortality for COPD has increased by 34 percent. Surprisingly, little is known about how COPD develops. Genetics may provide important clues. We know that of all long- term smokers, only 15 percent develop COPD. This is something that shows that some people are disposed to the disease. We also do not fully understand the role of genetics in other types of airway diseases, such as asthma. More research into COPD will likely help us understand why certain people with asthma also develop progressive and irreversible disease. In approximately two weeks, April 4th, an important document will be released by NHLBI and the World Health Organization called GOLD, that provides for the world community what can be done for COPD. We need break-through research to understand why people develop COPD and to effectively reduce the morbidity and mortality associated with airway diseases. The third issue is tuberculosis. Tuberculosis is an airborne infection that primarily affects the lungs, but can also affect other body parts, such as the brain, kidneys, and spine. TB is spread by coughing and sneezing. There are over 18,000 active cases of tuberculosis in the United States. The Institute of Medicine recently published a report that documents the cycles of attention and progress toward tuberculosis elimination, followed by periods of insufficient funding, and the re-emergence of TB. The IOM report provides the U.S. with a road map of recommendations on how to eliminate TB in the U.S. The American Lung Association and the American Thoracic Society endorse the IOM report and its recommendations. Representatives Brown, Morella, and Waxman will soon introduce legislation to give NIH and CDC the authority and resources to implement the IOM report. Thank you. [The information follows:] [GRAPHIC(S) NOT AVAILABLE IN TIFF FORMAT] Mr. Regula. Well, thank you. This shows a connection between the lungs and the heart. I am not sure how this is different from just an ordinary heart problem. Dr. Martin. I am sorry, in reference to COPD? Mr. Regula. Yes. Dr. Martin. Well, with COPD, although people with advanced COPD develop heart failure, and it is a complication, the vast majority of people with COPD die a slow respiratory death. Mr. Regula. Then it obviously would be connected with smoking? Dr. Martin. It is, and I think it does not always engender public support, when you consider a disease like COPD as being self-inflicted. Mr. Regula. Yes. Dr. Martin. But I would argue that every patient that I have ever taken care of with COPD acquired the addition to cigarettes when they were an adolescent, and typically under the age of 15. Mr. Regula. So that is the time to try to deal with the problem. Dr. Martin. Absolutely. Mr. Regula. I think you are right. It grieves me, when I drive past a high school, and I see these kids out there. Dr. Martin. Yes. Mr. Regula. You girls see that in your schools, do you not, and you wonder, why would you want to start? I do not know. Well, good luck to you. Dr. Martin. Thank you very much. Mr. Regula. Thank you, and we are sure glad to see you today. Dr. Martin. I bet. [Laughter.] Mr. Regula. The hearing is adjourned. Tuesday, March 27, 2001. TESTIMONY OF MEMBERS OF CONGRESS VARIOUS PROGRAMS AND PROJECTS WITNESS HON. JOSEPH CROWLEY, A REPRESENTATIVE IN CONGRESS FROM THE STATE OF NEW YORK Mr. Regula. Our first witness this morning is Mr. Joseph Crowley from the State of New York, who has some interest in various programs and projects. We try to limit you to five minutes. Good morning. Mr. Hoyer. Good morning, Mr. Chairman. I want to welcome the distinguished representative from the State of New York, Mr. Crowley. He's one of our outstanding members. Mr. Crowley. I thank Chairman Regula and my good friend, Mr. Hoyer, but also the Ranking Member, Mr. Obey, for granting me this opportunity to testify before the Subcommittee on Labor, Health and Human Services and Education Appropriations, to discuss some of my key priorities. To best communicate the needs of my district, I would like to present my remarks in three specific parts. They are educational priorities, strengthening of public health infrastructure and improving the quality of life for the people of Queens and the Bronx in New York. Regarding education, I believe it is imperative that our society continue to invest in our children and in our public schools. I recently conducted a study of the schools in my Congressional district that documented how almost every child in the public school system is being taught in classrooms that are nearly 100 percent over capacity. Unfortunately, this situation is all too common in school districts throughout New York City, and unfortunately more so throughout our Nation. In these types of environments, the teacher's ability to teach becomes seriously altered. For these reasons, old teaching methods and techniques do not always prepare young teachers for real life situations that occur in inner city school classrooms every day. As a response, the City University of New York has launched a teacher empowerment zone, which is a major effort to improve teacher training programs. The program would create virtual classrooms with teachers teaching students to observe during the course of their study, in addition to other traditional learning tools. A student enrolled in the teaching program would have the opportunity to monitor a real classroom with the use of digital technology and at the end of the class period, engage in a dialogue with the teacher of the class to discuss the events that have occurred. One of the sites of the program would be at LaGuardia Community College, part of the City University of New York system. This school is centrally located at a transit hub that links Queens, the most ethnically diverse borough in the City of New York, with the world's center of finance, commerce and of arts. The College provides access to higher education and serves New Yorkers of all backgrounds, ages and means. For its part in the teacher empowerment zone, LaGuardia Community College has launched a major campus-wide initiative to expand the educational use of digital technology and is prepared to focus particular attention on the interlocking issues of technology in instruction and assessment. For this project, I am requesting $2.8 million. This money would be used to improve the infrastructure and provide the faculty development needed to advance this initiative. Additionally, funding would be used to improve and expand classroom connectivity, create links to local secondary schools, upgrade available software and enhance professional development programs. This is a worthwhile and creative program that deserves Federal assistance. To continue to build on our children's potential, I am also seeking assistance for the Queensborough Public Library to expand its Jackson Heights Queens branch. The Queensborough Public Library has the highest circulation of any library system in the United States, and spends more money per capita on books than any other major urban library system in our country. The funding I seek will not only expand the Jackson Heights branch, but will also provide greater access of materials to patrons, provide resources for new children's programs, and allow for more computers, offering free access to the electronic information. Furthermore, there is one more additional educational program I would like to touch on that I did not include in my prepared remarks. The Taft Institute at Queens College, which is also my alma mater, the Taft Institute was founded in 1961 to honor Ohio Senator Robert Taft's exemplary record of public service and political courage. The Taft Institute is a non- partisan enterprise dedicated to promoting informed citizen participation in the United States and around the world. In 1996, the Taft Institute chose Queens College of the City University of New York as the site of its national headquarters. This institute strives to reverse the mounting trend of citizen apathy and cynicism. Its programs reflect the conviction that true democracy requires that each new generation of citizens be committed to civic involvement. At a time when the high water mark of political involvement, the simple act of casting a ballot, scarcely reaches 50 percent, the need for such a program should be self-evident. Yet the unexamined, often unspoken premise persists that active citizenship will somehow emerge spontaneously in adulthood without prior learning or experience. The Taft Institute takes the opposite view. Responsible citizenship must be fostered from the earliest age. To thisend, the Institute has created a program of professional development to inspire and empower the teachers who will help to shape America's political future. Funding for Taft Institute programs comes from both public and private sources. While private sector funding has significantly increased in recent years, the Institute seeks new sources of support to continue and expand the innovative civic education programs essential to our country. Among its distinguished fellows would be our Speaker, Dennis Hastert, just to name one. I hope that we can work together for this important program, and I am therefore reaching out to this Congress and this Committee for $300,000 for this important institute. With regard to the health concerns of New Yorkers and all Americans, I want to inform the Committee that last Thursday, I sent a letter to President Bush requesting at least $25 million for the Centers for Disease Control. These funds would be used to monitor, detect and combat West Nile encephalitis, a disease that originated in my Congressional district, but has since spread throughout the eastern seaboard. I was pleased to be joined by 43 other Northeastern members of Congress in this effort to ensure that adequate attention and resources are provided to combating this mosquito-borne virus. Additionally, I will be asking the Committee to provide the needed resources to combat sexually transmitted diseases including HIV and AIDS. Here I urge a two-pronged attack, one globally based and one locally based. On the prevention side, I would appreciate if the Committee would highlight the need for funding of microbicide testing. Microbicides would fill a gap in the range of prevention tools because they are woman controlled and could protect against various STDs, not just HIV. These user controlled products that kill or inactivate the bacteria in viruses that cause STDs and HIV-AIDS are the only hope to prevent the transmission for many women overseas and even some here in our own country. Locally, I seek funding for an innovative program in my district to combat sexually transmitted disease, including HIV- AIDS in the often overlooked minority community. While the rate of HIV-AIDS infections is decreasing in the white population, it has drastically increased in the African American and Latino populations. Finally, as the representative of the middle and working class districts in northwestern Queens and the southeastern Bronx, I would like to discuss some specific needs of my constituents. Among these needs are for the young adults of Queens and the Bronx. Therefore, I am working to secure vital dollars for additional computers for a job training center at the Queens Bridge Homes, America's largest public housing unit. In these uncertain economic times, these dollars are needed now more than ever to assure the support and strength of this job training and skill providing site. Oftentimes, public housing is seen as a trap of despair, but Queens Bridge is different. It has been successful in utilizing the full potential of residents to keep it safe and full of promise. I hope to build on the existing job training and educational center at Queens Bridge, so as to harness all the abilities of the people of this community. For my older constituents, I am working for two senior centers in my district that are in need of assistance. First, the Sunnyside Community Services Senior Center in Sunnyside, Queens, which seeks capital project funding to make their center both disability accessible and more senior friendly. While my office is working with them and the city and the State of New York for funding, a shortfall is expected, and I hope this Congress will be able to provide some funding for this important senior center. Additionally, I will be championing the cause of the seniors of North Flushing Senior Center, a center as familiar to Representative Lowey as it is to myself. Last year, a funding shortfall almost caused havoc at this important community organization. I hope that working together, we can ensure that meals are always provided and the good works of that institution will continue well into the future. There are a great many other needs in my community and throughout our global community for assistance. I thank you, Chairman Regula, for your time, and my good friend, Steny Hoyer, for being here and taking the time to listen to some of my priorities. [The information follows:] [GRAPHIC(S) NOT AVAILABLE IN TIFF FORMAT] Mr. Regula. Thank you. Quick question. The superintendent of New York, I heard him speak at a seminar, sounds like an impressive regime that he's installed. What do you think? Mr. Crowley. In terms of? Mr. Regula. The New York City school system. Is it Mr. Levy? Mr. Crowley. The chancellor. Yes, I think he's an impressive individual, and someone who has been able to work with not only both sides of the aisle, so to speak, but really work within all the different communities of New York. The one thing that he's been grappling with and we've all been grappling with has been class size, and the problem with school modernization and overcrowding, the lack thereof in schools. In my district particularly, we're faced with the fact that the average school age is 50 years of age, and one out of every two schools is 75 years or older. Mr. Regula. He mentioned it. Mr. Crowley. These are real problems. In Queens County, we expect to be between 30,000 and 50,000 seats shy by the year 2007. So forget about a school building, there's not actually a seat for these young people to sit in. That's a real crisis that we're facing in the New York city public school system. But Chancellor Levy is doing all he can. Mr. Regula. Sounds like an interesting approach. Mr. Hoyer? Mr. Hoyer. I have no questions, I'd like to thank Congressman Crowley for obviously a very thoughtful presentation, dealing with a number of different areas of critical concern to his district, and frankly, to the country. Mr. Crowley. Thank you. Thank you both. Mr. Regula. We'll give you the forms, if you don't have them, to make a formal request. Mr. Crowley. Thank you very much. ---------- Tuesday, March 27, 2001. EDUCATIONAL AND HEALTHCARE PROGRAMS WITNESS HON. BILL PASCRELL, A REPRESENTATIVE IN CONGRESS FROM THE STATE OF NEW JERSEY Mr. Regula. Our next will be Mr. Pascrell of New Jersey, Education and Health. Summarize as much as you can. We have a long list today. Mr. Pascrell. Mr. Chairman, thanks for extending the courtesy to us, and members of this great Committee. Just a week ago, I was here with Thelma Thiel, if you remember, the President of the Hepatitis Foundation, and you were so kind to her, and I thank you for that. Today I want to talk about two subjects, education and health care, if I may. As a former teacher, I know the impact that large classroom sizes have on student performance. The quality of our children's education is largely dependent upon a strong teaching work force. According to the United States Department of Education, the Nation will need 1 million new teachers by the year 2010. Similar to what's happening to teachers is happening to nurses in America, as you well know. The looming shortage is already creating problems for school districts across the country. Even in advance of the peak of the shortage, school administrators are already reporting tremendous difficulties in recruiting qualified teachers. We can't get science and math teachers, they're moving into other areas that are obviously, will put more money in their pocket, to be very honest with you. While this is certainly a national problem, New Jersey, Mr. Chairman, particularly is plagued by the mass exodus of qualified teachers who are retiring. We rank among the top five States in the Nation for projected growth, however, in the student population. The number of high school graduates in the State is expected to increase by 25 percent in the year 2008. That's not a long way off. Mr. Chairman, the numbers do not tell the whole story here. Unless the new members of the teaching force are well educated, well prepared and unless current teachers' knowledge and skills are updated and honed, our Nation's need for quality educators will not be met. A compelling and growing body of research shows that the single greatest determinant of student achievement is teacher quality. New and experienced teachers alike are educating an increasingly diverse population with many different languages and cultural backgrounds. Mr. Regula. If I could interrupt you there. If you had a priority choice between more pay, upgrading skills versus reducing classroom size, assuming you can't do both, which would you opt for? Mr. Pascrell. Qualified teachers. Mr. Regula. That's my inclination, too, that that's number one, is to have qualified teachers. Mr. Pascrell. I can recommend a book, and I don't want to take more time, Mr. Chairman, you've been more than fair with me, but the book, Thomas Jefferson's Children, excellent book on education, provides reforms that are succinct and we can all understand. I recommend it. Mr. Regula. Thank you. Mr. Pascrell. Schools of education must meet the needs of this diverse student population and the needs of our technologically advancing world. That's why we wired our schools. The university in my district has been working on this problem. Montclair State University, 90 years in business, has built a nationally recognized teacher education program. Currently, Montclair graduates approximately 300 teacher candidates a year. It also turns away hundreds of qualified students each year, because of an acute shortage of space at the university. To alleviate this problem and to help the State and the entire Nation create more teachers, Montclair State is building a $45 million center for teacher preparation and technology. State of the art, authentic, not money thrown to the wind. The new center will allow the university to increase the number of teacher candidates it graduates each year by 60 percent. It will also allow the university to increase the number of masters degrees it awards to teachers already in the field, a critical component of teacher retention. While increasing in number of teachers, the center for teacher preparation and technology will make certain these teachers are competent in incorporating instructional technology into their teaching. This center will include interactive distance education equipment, wireless technology, full internet access and applications and hardware to keep track of student progress more effectively. This is supported bipartisanly, Mr. Chairman. Montclair State will receive $5 million from the State of New Jersey. It is asking Congress for $5 million to complete this critical project. And the rest of the money will be raised by the University itself. There are numerous pieces of legislation that call for an increase of teachers in the coming years. I believe, Mr. Chairman, this is a good project. I ask the Committee to take a look at it. Ask me any questions if you will. I think it's worthy, because it goes to the very heart of what we're talking about in education. The second project is a 21st Century institute for medical rehabilitation research. During the last cycle, my colleagues, Frelinghuysen, Payne, Rothman and Andrews and I asked this Committee for $3.9 million. Congress provided $775,000 of that amount. I'm here today to ask for the remaining funds, Mr. Chairman. This Committee has long recognized the extraordinary value and promise of medical research. You have demonstrated that time and time again with your support for increases in funding to NIH. All Americans should be grateful for this action as you are bringing all of us new hope for key breakthroughs in medicine and treatment. Up until now, this area has not seen the kinds of increases that many others have enjoyed and the need remains substantial in the area of rehabilitation medicine and research. One of the premier institutions in the country in the rehabilitation research field is in my district, the Kessler Medical Rehabilitation Research and Education Corporation, and the Kessler Rehab Hospital are widely regarded as leaders nationally in rehab medicine, treatment and research. Much more can and must be done to accelerate and build on the work which is already underway. So several years ago, the Kessler organization decided to create a new and unique effort in the United States. This was it, this was pro forma for the rest of what has happened since. Last year, your Subcommittee recommended funding for this effort. I'm deeply grateful, Kessler is deeply grateful. One area of rehab that I am particularly involved in, and interested in, we've done work in other areas, is the traumatic brain injury. We now have a registration list which is very critical. Kessler is dealing with this problem, Mr. Chairman. Two million Americans experience a traumatic brain injury every year. Two million. About half of these cases result in at least short term disability. Eighty thousand people sustain severe brain injuries, leading to long term disability. Most people with a brain injury must experience some type of rehab in order to function in their daily lives. So Mr. Chairman, to make a long story short, I ask for these two projects, and I think they're worthy projects, and I've come to the right Committee. [The information follows:] [GRAPHIC(S) NOT AVAILABLE IN TIFF FORMAT] Mr. Regula. Well, we'll probably get a better estimate of that later in the year. [Laughter.] Thank you. Is Kessler tied with NIH in any way? Mr. Pascrell. Yes, much of the dollars comes from NIH. It's probably the premier institution in the country. Mr. Regula. So it works with them? Mr. Pascrell. A lot of breakthroughs, Mr. Chairman. Mr. Regula. Your education institution that you mentioned, is that a State university? Mr. Pascrell. Yes. Montclair State University is a State university. Mr. Regula. Mr. Hoyer. Mr. Hoyer. No questions. Thank you. Mr. Regula. Thank you for coming. Mr. Pascrell. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. ---------- Tuesday, March 27, 2001. NATIONAL CENTER FOR INJURY PREVENTION AND CONTROL WITNESS HON. MICHAEL HONDA, A REPRESENTATIVE IN CONGRESS FROM THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA Mr. Regula. Mr. Honda, we're ready for you. Glad you came. Mr. Hoyer. Mr. Chairman, as you know, Mr. Honda is one of our newer members, but a very experienced member, a distinguished member of the general assembly in California, and does an outstanding job. Mr. Honda. Does that mean I get a raise? Mr. Regula. Do you take any responsibility for the rolling blackouts? Mr. Honda. No, not yet. I take the responsibility of helping, though. Mr. Regula. It's a tough issue out there. Mr. Honda. Yes, it is. Not to be funny, though, there may be light at the end of the tunnel. Mr. Chairman, thank you very much for allowing me to testify here. I want to thank Mr. Hoyer for acknowledging my presence also. Distinguished members of the Subcommittee, thank you for this opportunity to testify today. I'm here to respectfully request your assistance on a very important initiative that affects millions of Americans. Specifically, I'm asking you to consider an additional $1.5 million for the National Center for Injury Prevention and Control at the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, to address a very important topic, sleep deprivation and fatigue related injury. I think many people smile when they hear the term sleep and fatigue, because they probably just pooh-pooh it and say that it's something that doesn't seem to be very important. Mr. Regula. We had a public witness, an M.D., that spoke at length about that, runs a couple of clinics back in Ohio. Mr. Honda. Right. Mr. Regula. So it is, and I think the NIH has done some work, is doing work on the impact. Mr. Honda. Right. We just need to do more work in the public domain to sort of raise the issue. I appreciate this opportunity. Sleep represents a third of every person's life. It has a tremendous impact on how we live, function, perform, and think during the other two-thirds of our lives. Lack of adequate, restful sleep has serious consequences at home, in the workplace, at school and on the highway. Untreated sleep disorders, of which there are more than 80, and sleep deprivation contributes to injuries, impaired work productivity, academic performance, reduced quality of life, poor health and even death. As a teacher, a school principal and school board member, I have seen sleep deprivation as a growing problem for high school students, the largest at-risk group for fall-asleep car crashes, as well as being a factor in causing car accidents for parents, transportation workers, police officers and medical residents. According to the National Sleep Foundation, the direct or indirect cost to the United States economy due to sleep disorders and sleep deprivation are estimated to exceed $100 billion each year. As someone with a sleep disorder myself, I know these problems all too well. I am one of the approximately 40 million Americans who suffers from chronic sleep disorder. I was diagnosed with obstructive sleep apnea, which is a very common sleep and breathing disorder that affects at least 12 million Americans. Each time a person with sleep apnea stops breathing, sometimes up to 400 times a night in severe cases, and I was one of them, the brain awakens the person just enough to get them breathing again. What I learned is that when you stop breathing, the chemistry of your blood changes, and it clicks off in your brain to say, wake up, dummy, wake up. That's when you hear folks just gasping for breath in the middle of the night, and then they continue to sleep. This allows them to go into deep sleep, what they call REM, where they get that rest, but they continue to appear to be sleeping, to get their rest, but they don't get that deep rest. This not only affects the quality of a person's sleep and daytime functioning, but it leads to very serious health problems. Untreated sleep apnea has been linked to hypertension, cardiovascular disease, diabetes, depression, memory problems, obesity and other serious problems. I am very lucky, because unlike most undiagnosed Americans with sleep disorders, I have a nationally recognized physician, Dr. William DeMent, who was able to treat my sleep disorders. And the diagnosis and proper sleep treatment definitely has improved the quality of my life immeasurably. I say, Mr. Chairman, that it's a malady that can be cured overnight. While public awareness is desperately needed, a strong Federal partner with expertise and ability to disseminate tested and proven education training and injury prevention programs to communities throughout the Nation is needed even more. The CDC can help us address the comprehensive and complex health and safety problems related to sleep issues by developing a sleep awareness action plan that would set national priorities around sleep issues in public health and safety. This five year sleep awareness action plan would develop the evaluative research including daily collection through the National Center for Injury Prevention and Control and others at the CDC. The research would include an attempt to validate or improve existing surveys and survey methodologies regarding how sleep deprivation problems are related to the on the job injuries, highway crashes and other medical conditions, such as diabetes, heart disease, cancer and obesity. The data from this research will allow the CDC to devote accurate educational material and model prevention and health promotion programs to provide to States as they address these important issues. This information will begin to turn the tide of injuries, health programs and costs associated with sleepiness and sleep disorders. So as I sit here today, I'm happy to report that I am feeling fine. But I want all of you to know that it has taken hard work with my doctor, reprioritizing with my family and my life. I hope that you all take the time you need to get the quality sleep you need every night. As a new member of Congress, I am quickly learning that our schedules are so packed and our days are so long that you are probably not getting all the sleep that you need, but getting sufficient sleep should not be optional. I just want to close by thanking you for the opportunity to testify today, and I look forward to working with the group and providing myself as a personal testimony to the issue of sleep disorders and fatigue, as it relates not only to adults and sleep disorders, but also fatigue as it relates to young people who are coming to a point where, especially seniors that are coming to graduation. We see too many youngsters who fall asleep at the wheel because of fatigue. It doesn't have to be disorders, it's just our attitude toward sleep and sleep deprivation. [The information follows:] [GRAPHIC(S) NOT AVAILABLE IN TIFF FORMAT] Mr. Regula. I think you're suggesting that CDC needs to do a major public information campaign to make people aware that this is a problem that's curable. Mr. Honda. That's correct. Succinctly put, Mr. Chairman. We're looking for support of $1.5 million. Mr. Regula. We're going to be visiting there next week, so it will be a good question for us to raise. Mr. Hoyer, questions? Mr. Hoyer. No, I have no questions. Thank you, Mr. Honda. Mr. Regula. Thank you for coming. Mr. Honda. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. ---------- Tuesday, March 27, 2001. PROJECTS WITNESS HON. ROBERT FILNER, A REPRESENTATIVE IN CONGRESS FROM THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA Mr. Regula. Mr. Filner. Mr. Hoyer. I pledge to Mr. Filner that I will read every sentence of your statement. Mr. Filner. I just want you to give me the money. [Laughter.] Mr. Regula. Welcome, Mr. Filner. Mr. Filner. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. And we all appreciate your--and the staff and as many members as possible--sitting through and listening to all these requests. We do appreciate it and thank you so much. I bring forward to you two proposals that are important to my district, my constituency, but I think also serve as models for broader application to similar situations in other parts of our Nation. First is a $3.9 million appropriation for Paradise Valley Hospital to create what is called a complementary medical center, and therefore address health needs of a minority population that is often overlooked. Your Committee provided about $700,000 for this center in the last appropriation. This would allow them to actually set up and begin services in this complementary medical center. It would be a unique showcase of how public and private health care enterprise can cooperate, because it would provide needed specialty care to an under-served community which then could be replicated throughout the country. What we have in Paradise Hospital is the only community hospital in our county. It serves not only the whole county, but it is located in the fourth poorest city in California, National City, one of the cities I represent. In fact, the thirteenth poorest city in the Nation. And it is truly a safety net provider, but has not been able to provide the kind of complementary health care that wealthier medical centers can. Mr. Regula. Is this a non-profit or a city facility, or State? Mr. Filner. It's a non-profit hospital, but it's a private hospital. It's in the Adventist medical chain of facilities. As I said, the complementary nature or the complementary medical techniques have been available to wealthier communities, but have never really been given in a holistic way or in a very comprehensive way to disadvantaged populations. What we have in mind here is to showcase that when these services are provided to even poorer communities, they will have a very much enhanced medical care and in fact save us, of course, as a Nation, money in the long run. So again, you have provided some startup money for this in the last appropriation cycle. The money that I would ask for now would allow them to actually set up the center. In my second request, I am joined by my colleague, Congresswoman Susan Davis from San Diego. We are asking that the senior community center of San Diego be funded for a demonstration program, $250,000 for Title IV of the Older Americans Act, to establish a demonstration project entitled Health Promotion/Harm Reduction. What this is for is seniors, a growing number of seniors, who have emotional or mental health problems, to help them before they get more seriously ill or in fact, thrown out on the street into homelessness. The only organization in San Diego to provide at-risk seniors is the senior community centers. They have shown in an 18 month test that if they provide intensive case management services in conjunction with nutrition services, the self-reliance of this population is greatly increased. So with just $250,000, they think they can in fact decrease emergency medical interventions, reduce medical costs to our community, get early treatment of illness and thus allow seniors to have an independent and healthy lifestyle. These are two areas, again, for San Diego, mainly in poor communities for a population that is under-served, as you well know. Mr. Regula. Is the senior unit a private, non-profit? Mr. Filner. It's a non-profit also. Mr. Regula. It's not operated by your senior groups? Mr. Filner. It's not operated by the city government. It's a private non-profit. Again, these services, we believe of course not only will help our specific population, but serve as good models for other places in the country. So that's what I have before you, Mr. Chairman. I thank you for the time. [The information follows:] [GRAPHIC(S) NOT AVAILABLE IN TIFF FORMAT] Mr. Regula. Thank you for bringing this to our attention. ---------- Tuesday, March 27, 2001. IMPACT AID AND CROHN'S AND LYME DISEASE WITNESS HON. SUE W. KELLY, A REPRESENTATIVE IN CONGRESS FROM THE STATE OF NEW YORK Mr. Regula. The next witness is Representative Congresswoman Sue Kelly from New York. Sue, on Impact Aid, Crohn's and Lyme Disease. Ms. Kelly. That's a polyglot, isn't it? Mr. Regula. You have quite a list. Ms. Kelly. I brought this map, because I want to show you this map. This map shows you the area, actually, of West Point. And this little tiny strip, this little tiny strip outlined in red right there, this all belongs in one township. This little tiny strip of land, which represents about not quite 7 percent of all of the land in this---- Mr. Regula. It's the Hudson River, I assume. Ms. Kelly. This is the Hudson River. Right there, bounded by the Hudson River, that's all the land that this township has that they can use for any kind of tax purposes at all to support the school system. This is the most highly impacted school system in the Nation, here at West Point. Mr. Regula. Is that all West Point? Ms. Kelly. This is all West Point. Mr. Regula. How many acres would be in that? Ms. Kelly. West Point? I don't know. I should know. I'm the Vice Chairman of the West Point Board, I should know, but I don't. [Laughter.] But the thing I'm trying to point out here is that these people can't grow. This is mountain in here. So they have mountainous areas in here, they have the river over here. Mr. Regula. Is that a school district? Ms. Kelly. There is a school district here, and the students who are taught in grade school on the Point come out into this school district for their high school. Mr. Regula. So the Point doesn't operate a high school? Ms. Kelly. It doesn't operate a high school, a junior high, high school. They come out into this district for their high school. Mr. Regula. That would be all the personnel that operate it. Ms. Kelly. All the civilian and military personnel. And remember, this is an active base as well. All those people send their kids out here into this little area to this high school. Years ago, this high school was properly funded. And I'm talking about Section 8002. This is the most highly impacted district in the Nation. We've got to have our Impact Aid. Because years ago, we can get a copy of that for you if you want. Years ago, this was fully funded and we had enough funding coming in there to help the school district. When I was elected, that school district was teaching social studies out of a book that stopped at the Vietnam War. That was six years ago. These kids had very old books, they had teachers that were leaving, their teachers hadn't had any advanced training, the school buildings themselves were in terrible shape. And this school district was a threatened school district. There it is, sandwiched between the Point, the river and mountains. They can't grow, they've got nothing to tax. They need our help. We've got to have that money that we had, at least what we had last year if not more. We really do need an increase. But since we've been working---- Mr. Regula. Does that go out by formula? Ms. Kelly. Yes, it goes out by formula. I'm just trying to locate it and see. Mr. Regula. Does it depend on the per capital wealth of the district as to how much they get? Ms. Kelly. You can imagine, if it's a military base, you know the state of what the military gets paid. Mr. Regula. On the portion that they tax. Do you use real estate taxes in New York for schools? Ms. Kelly. We use real estate taxes for schools, but there's no place to tax. This is very, there's only so much of that land you can use, because people live there, too. There's housing. Mr. Regula. What I'm getting at is, the Impact Aid is predicated on the amount of available tax revenues within a district. So Impact Aid would vary from place to place depending on the wealth of the district that's involved. What you're saying is you need more, either change the formula or more money to this district. Ms. Kelly. I need more money in this district. We need a better formula for taking--now, there's 8002, which is land based, and I'm talking about land based right now, because---- Mr. Regula. Staff tells me you went from 32 million to 40 million last year. So apparently we do control in the Committee the macro amount that goes to each of the districts. Ms. Kelly. You do, yes, absolutely. Mr. Regula. That's what I was trying to determine, is it formula, and the answer is no. It's just a judgment call. Ms. Kelly. Well, correct me if I'm wrong, sir, but I think perhaps there is a formula for one part of this. It's the per capita student part that has a formula. Then the part I'm talking about does not. Mr. Regula. Kind of an enrichment. Ms. Kelly. It is something to make up for the fact that the land was taken by the Federal Government. The Point didn't used to be that large. But for one reason or another, during the various wars, they've added land in because they need it for training. And as they've added land in, endingit for training, they've eaten into the township. Mr. Regula. Does the Point train any other than cadets? Do they have other training facilities there? You mentioned that it was more than just a military academy. Ms. Kelly. It's an active Army base as well. Mr. Regula. That's what I'm saying, do they train troops there? Ms. Kelly. I don't know if we train--we train specified things. They run mountaineering courses, they do some other things. Plus they have some, if I remember correctly, I know we have a mint there, there's a number of Federal activities that are going on at the Point and a lot of people working there and living there on the Point. The thing is, what we got last year wasn't even 50 percent of what basically we are entitled to under what we were promised when the Point's land was taken, when the Point took our land. So from an Impact Aid standpoint, we really, I really need to help these people. Because what's happened, because we got that increase, we now have teachers who are coming back into the district. We are training the teachers, we have bought new books, there's a social worker to help the kids, which we've never had before, and we really need not only that, but the school has a new roof over part of it, so that now they can use that part of the school. It was really raining in. So it's not money gone to waste. It's good money, we need to do it. And we really need to have a full funding. I'll take 50 percent, that's $62 million, but it's the second step of a promise that we have made in the past to this school district. And Impact Aid all across the Nation needs our help. But this is the most highly impacted district in the Nation. I want to go quickly to a couple of other things that I have on the ticket here. Because we can talk further if you'd like about the Impact Aid. I want to talk about Crohn's disease. Crohn's disease is an inflammatory bowel disease. Mr. Regula. We had some public witnesses on that. Not here today, but in the past couple of weeks. Ms. Kelly. It encompasses a whole group of diseases. There's about a million people in the United States who have this disease. It is economically and physically debilitating for people. I know about that, because my daughter has Crohn's disease. Mr. Regula. You're asking for more money on research on this? Ms. Kelly. I want you to designate more money to research. I know you can't tag it that way, but I'd like report language that really strongly recommends NIH do something to put more money into research for Crohn's. It's on the increase, and it is very debilitating. People who have Crohn's disease have the option of losing a part of their intestine or sometimes all of their intestine. The disease can come from your mouth to your anus. It blocks off your ability to allow food to get through your gut, and then what happens is you go, what happens to a lot of people with Crohn's disease is they get sick, they have an operation and they lose a piece of something. They are fine for a while, they get sick, they have an operation, they lose another piece of something. Pretty soon, there's not much left between their mouth and their anus, and they live with a feeding tube if they live at all. It's a very serious disease, it's on the increase, and we are paying very little attention to the people who have Crohn's disease. We need to give them some hope and we need to do some research. I hope that you will think about putting some strong report language in about that. Mr. Regula. We will have NIH before us, and your concern is that we just get more money into research to try to find cures. Ms. Kelly. There are some interesting ideas about cures. Dr. Crohn actually lived in my district before he died. And he is the person who identified this disease that was killing people and no one knew what it was. But from his identification, from that point onward, there's been very little attention paid to it. It's one of these diseases that people just simply don't pay a lot of attention to. Just like Lyme disease, which is the other thing that brought me here today. I could talk about a couple of other things, like juvenile diabetes and so forth. But Lyme disease, the epicenter of Lyme is in my district. So I'm here for three causes: Impact Aid, which I care ardently about; Crohn's disease, which is in my family; and Lyme disease, which I have had. We are in the epicenter of it, we need to have---- Mr. Regula. Is this the deer---- Ms. Kelly. Deer ticks, yes. And we have some ideas about what we can do to stop the transmission of Lyme. We need money for research. We have come up with a vaccine that works, but it doesn't work on people over 60 or under 10, as far as I know, from what their research has shown. So we can't vaccinate our very young. And it's a debilitating disease. Many people are left permanently disabled because of Lyme disease. So from a long range standpoint, it's a very expensive disease. Mr. Regula. It's tick-borne, and the deer is the host? Ms. Kelly. The deer are a host for the tick. The tick is actually the host of the spirochete that causes the disease. There is now three identified diseases, but it's only the deer tick I'm talking about. There's also the reketsial diseases that are borne by dog ticks. That's the Rocky Mountain spotted fever and so on. We have cases of Rocky Mountain spotted fever that have been on Long Island last year. It used to be only in the Rocky Mountains. Now that is spreading. We need research on tick-borne diseases, both reketsial diseases and the spirochete diseases, because we don't understand completely how to stop them. And they are walking right straight through our Nation. I'm chairman of the Lyme Disease Caucus. We have a number of people, I've had several of our colleagues come up to me on the Floor saying, let me get on your caucus, my wife just got Lyme disease, because it is very prevalent in the midwest, it's prevalent on the coast and in the mountainous areas and the Rocky Mountains and out in California and Oregon and Washington. But it's most prevalent, and the epicenter is in the northeast. We need your help. Mr. Regula. I remember you telling me about it. It doesn't seem to have impacted in Ohio yet, but it will probably get there. Ms. Kelly. That's perhaps because the doctors don't know how to identify it. One of the biggest problems we have is that doctors don't understand what they're looking at. They know they have a disease and they can treat it with a broadspectrum, heavy duty antibiotic, and sometimes if it's a mild case, it will knock it out. And they think, well, didn't quite identify it, but I got it. So the patient is better. Part of what we need to do is use this money for educating the doctors and the other part for doing the research needed to stop the disease itself. We can do it. Thank you. [The information follows:] [GRAPHIC(S) NOT AVAILABLE IN TIFF FORMAT] Mr. Regula. Thank you. Mr. Sherwood. Mr. Sherwood. What's the name of the school district? Ms. Kelly. The name of the school district is Highland Falls School District. Mr. Sherwood. What's the annual budget? Ms. Kelly. I don't know if I have it. I'll have to get back to you, because I don't remember. Mr. Sherwood. Do you have the cost per student per year? Ms. Kelly. I can give you a cost per student per year. I can also give you a per student, how much the Impact Aid means. We're talking about over a million dollars to this school district. And if we don't get it, that school district will fold. Mr. Sherwood. You mentioned $62 million. Ms. Kelly. Because this is what we've been asking for. This is the second step in what we had asked for originally and got started on. And a ten year program to bring the section 8002 funding into its full funding level. And that's only 50 percent that I'm asking for. Mr. Sherwood. But did you use the term $62 million? Ms. Kelly. I did, yes. We need to have the funding next year. We need to have the funding next year at $62 million, because this is what the school district has got to have. Mr. Sherwood. You mean that's their total budget or what you're asking for under Impact Aid? Ms. Kelly. No, this is for the total Impact Aid. Our school district gets a piece of that. But what we haven't had is 50 percent funding. We need to get it fully funded. Any one of us who represents an impacted district knows full well that without that funding, we're going to go down the tubes with these school districts. Since we have a President who's dedicated to education, we want to fund these schools. We need to. Mr. Sherwood. But doesn't the State of New York fund their participation in your school district on the wealth effect? In other words, the smaller your tax base, the higher percent you get from the State? That's the way it works in Pennsylvania. Ms. Kelly. We get some aid that way, but we have not gotten the school building aid that we needed. There's just not enough money to--we have New York City, as you know, that eats up the majority of our funding for our education budget. So we have not had that much. The people in this town, if you look at their income, this is not a wealthy town. It's a very, very--I hesitate to say low income, but it's lower middle income folks who live there. These people are people who are living on Government salaries because they work for West Point, they're the people who are the teachers at West Point or they're working on the base, and these are guys and women who are, you know, they're taking Government salaries. They don't have a lot of resources. And they don't have the money to put into the school itself, and there are not a lot of wealthy people who live in the surrounding area to put taxes in. Mr. Sherwood. Is there a local elected school board that makes the financial decisions? Ms. Kelly. We do have a local elected school board that makes those decisions, yes. Mr. Sherwood. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. Mr. Regula. Mr. Cunningham, any questions? Mr. Cunningham. Mr. Chairman, thank you. I'd just make a comment. I've worked with Ms. Kelly even when I was chairman of the Education Subcommittee on Authorization. I went to that area. Matter of fact, if you haven't made a trip to, West Point itself is underfunded, the military academy, compared to the other academies. If you look at the area around, she's not exaggerating. Impact Aid is critical to her particular district, more so than I think a lot of districts. Maybe not so much as mine---- [Laughter.] Mr. Cunningham [continuing]. But it is important. Having visited the area, it is, Impact Aid is very important to that area. Ms. Kelly. I thank you. Mr. Cunningham has worked very carefully with me, because he has been there, he's driven through the trailer parks that these people live in, and he knows full well that it's very important for us to get---- Mr. Regula. The trailer parks are on the West Point campus? Ms. Kelly. Not on the campus, sir, but they're outside in Highland Falls. That's where these folks can afford to live. Mr. Regula. Thank you for coming. ---------- Tuesday, March 27, 2001. IMPACT AID WITNESS HON. MARK STEVEN KIRK, A REPRESENTATIVE IN CONGRESS FROM THE STATE OF ILLINOIS Mr. Regula. Mr. Kirk from the State of Illinois, Impact Aid. We've heard that subject discussed here. Mr. Kirk. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. I'm here to basically underscore the point. I sit here as the successor to John Porter, so I with some trepidation testify before this Committee. Mr. Regula. You have Great Lakes, then, don't you? Mr. Kirk. I do. And I used to be sitting on the seats in the back row there very recently. So to be here is a real honor. For me, in our Congressional district, as far as the United States military in the midwest, we're about it. But boy, are we it. If you join the United States Navy, you're coming to the Tenth---- Mr. Regula. I spent some time in Great Lakes. Very familiar with it. Mr. Kirk. And now that all naval training is being concentrated there--well, we didn't steal it, we bought if fair and square. For us, now, at Great Lakes, we expect the recruit population will go from 50,000 to 70,000 in the coming four years. So as a member of the military family, it is only growing in our district. Mr. Regula. Is that the only one giving boot camp now? Mr. Kirk. That's it. Mr. Regula. For the whole USA? Mr. Kirk. For the surface fleet, right. With me is the actual superintendent of the district, 187 school district, Dr. Patricia Pickles. Mr. Chairman, with your permission, if I could have Dr. Pickles join me up here. Mr. Regula. Okay. Mr. Kirk. I actually stand in awe of Dr. Pickles and what she went through. As the Impact Aid situation worsened about four years ago, this Subcommittee rescued the program, and specifically district 187. We were looking at scenarios in which we would have to close down schools in north Chicago and send, bus the students to schools in surrounding school districts, which would have made no sense, because we had a perfectly functioning good school infrastructure there. But the structure of education funding did not allow us to meet the needs of the students. In our 187 school district, several others were approaching over 30 percent of the students coming from military housing. So this program is essential for our very survival, and will become increasingly essential. As Great Lakes expands its impact on all of the surrounding school districts will grow. I have a detailed statement, which with your permission---- Mr. Regula. All the statements will be part of the record. Mr. Kirk. I would just like to underscore a couple of key points. The military family that we know, I just left the fleet last year, so for me, I'm coming straight out of that environment. My last tour was in Operation Northern Watch. For us, we have seen, Charlie Muscow is a great academician at Northwestern University, who studies the cultural divide emerging between the active duty military and the civilian world, it's really expanding. And we see that in the kids. For us, we are expecting that about 50 percent of the recruits coming into today's military are from military families. So the children of the men and women who protect us today will be the people who protect our children tomorrow. With all of this concern about military pay, health care, housing and benefits, I would suggest we add one key component. And that is Impact Aid for military education. I made this point very forcefully with Secretary Rumsfeld, who is actually also the Congressman from our district. He represented our district in the 1960s. And with Secretary Paige, who made a very forceful statement in favor of Impact Aid before the House Budget Committee. That's the key point that I want to make, that these young leaders in these impacted schools will most likely be the military personnel of the future. That point needs to be made to support this program. [The information follows:] [GRAPHIC(S) NOT AVAILABLE IN TIFF FORMAT] Mr. Regula. Does Great Lakes impact on a number of school districts? Mr. Kirk. It does. For us it's North Chicago, Waukegan, Highland Park, Glen View, Lake Forest. Mr. Regula. And they all get a piece of the Impact Aid, then? Mr. Kirk. They do, but let me hand it over to Patricia. She has one of the, probably the most heavily impacted districts in the country. Ms. Pickles. Most of the students do attend North Chicago Public Schools, district 187, 35 percent of our student population---- Mr. Regula. Thirty-five percent of your student population is military? Ms. Pickles. Thirty-five percent. Mr. Regula. So Impact Aid is an important part of your budget? Ms. Pickles. Very important part. Over 72 percent of our student population qualifies for free and reduced meals. With that 35 percent, more than 200 of those students are identified as needing special needs, so they need special education, which is an additional burden in terms of cost. And as the Congressman stated, almost 10 years ago, our district almost dissolved because we didn't have the funds to support them due to the Federal presence. So we dearly need Impact Aid. Mr. Regula. All right, thank you. I know it's a tough situation, you heard Ms. Kelly. Mr. Kirk. As you all know, Chairman Porter spent a lot of time on this. It was no accident. And for us, I would expect that the size of the military under this Administration will grow. It's already growing in my district, so it's under those concerns that we look forward to supporting your legislation and supporting the program. Mr. Regula. Thank you. Mr. Kirk. Thank you. Mr. Cunningham. Mr. Chairman, could I ask one real quick question on it? San Diego does have a lot of military, as well as important in Impact Aid. You alluded to, as far as the special education, we have a hospital called Balboa there. Many times, military families seek orders that are close to those hospitals, because of their children and special education. Is that one of the reasons that military families are drawn there, because of the medical facility? Mr. Kirk. Yes, we are not only home to the Great Lakes Naval Hospital, we're also home to the North Chicago VA Medical Center, which, if you look at the morbidity and mortality statistics among DOD and military related health care facilities, is one of the best in the country. The taxpayers spent about $110 million there to bring that facility up to the state of the art. And that is an enormous attractive factor. What we've seen now, and it's just like, I just got off Dakani so I know the attractiveness of San Diego. But similarly, in northern Illinois, people like to, when they leave the service, remain with us. And it's because of those services. Mr. Cunningham. I know my sister-in-law just testified before the committees in charge of special education in San Diego City. I think it would be good to do a study on the relationship of military families, special education and Impact Aid, how it really affects the entire community. Mr. Kirk. Right. Mr. Cunningham. Because the original intent is to make sure that it didn't, with Native Americans or the military, and it does. So it's an area in which I think all of us, Republicans and Democrats, support. I don't see why we can't help. I don't know if we can help as much with budget, but I think we could do that. I was sworn in at Glen View Naval Air Station and I coached football at Insdale. So I'm very familiar with the area. Mr. Kirk. Gosh. Well, Mr. Chairman, as you know, since the military most likely will be growing, this program is one of the pieces of glue that allowed the community to welcome the military family and expansion in our districts. If expansion of Great Lakes means bankrupting the local school districts, we've got a problem on our hands. So thank you. Mr. Regula. Thank you. Mr. Sherwood, any questions? Mr. Sherwood. No, thank you. ---------- Tuesday, March 27, 2001. HEALTH PROJECTS WITNESS HON. LYNN WOOLSEY, A REPRESENTATIVE IN CONGRESS FROM THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA Mr. Regula. Next is Mrs. Woolsey from California. Any park issues today? Mrs. Woolsey. No park issues today, no, but there will be in the future, I can assure you. Mr. Regula. I'm quite sure. Mrs. Woolsey. Speaking of Impact Aid, that affects Park Service personnel also. Mr. Regula. True. Mrs. Woolsey. Thank you, Mr. Regula, for hearing me again, and thank you, members of the Committee, for giving me the opportunity to talk about five excellent education and health projects in my Congressional district. Some of you, well, you, Mr. Regula, Mr. Chairman, you heard my constituent, Dr. Sushma Taylor testify last week about Center Point, a non-profit comprehensive drug and alcohol treatment center. Center Point is one of a very few full service drug and alcohol treatment centers that provides comprehensive social, educational, vocational, medical, psychological, housing and rehab service. Mr. Regula. Do they take patients from all over the country or just in California? Mrs. Woolsey. Mainly in California, but I'm sure that they do tradeoffs with other areas in the country. Mr. Regula. But is it a private non-profit? Mrs. Woolsey. Private non-profit. Mr. Regula. Thank you. Mrs. Woolsey. But there's local funding, Federal funding, State funding involved. That's why again, I'm supporting their request for $1.8 million to purchase and equip an additional rehab center, and $1.5 million for their successful adolescent residential treatment program. Next, I'm very proud that I represent the only public four year university, Sonoma State University, serving the large six county region north of the San Francisco Bay. On behalf of Sonoma State University, I'm asking for $1 million for lab equipment for their masters program in computer and engineering sciences. I'm also requesting for them $1 million for their lifelong learning institute, which offers programs specifically tailored to the interests and needs of the North Bay senior population. The third request I have is an exciting new program in my district for Dominican University, a private university that serves minorities, women in great proportions and has one of the best diversities of any private institution that I know of in at least the North Bay, but probably in many parts of the country. What they have is, they're trying to develop a training and lifelong learning center to address the current shortage of math and science teachers, and to meet the need for health professionals in the Bay region and around the Nation. We don't have a number for their request at this moment, they came in with a huge number that would have wiped out all the rest of my requests, so we're asking them to come back with something else, and I'll provide that when I write my requests to you. Mr. Regula. If you have multiple requests, it would be helpful if you sort of prioritize them, because obviously we're not going to have enough funding to do everything everybody would like. Mrs. Woolsey. And Mr. Chairman---- Mr. Regula. So if we had your priorities, it would be helpful. Mrs. Woolsey. I appreciate that, and I am willing to do that. I also know that what we ask for we don't always get all of, but I sort of feel that if we get our nose under the tent and you see how well these programs work, then the next year we can build on that. One of the programs that we've had experience with in that regard is Yosemite National Institute, an institute that conducts institutionally rigorous hands-on environmental science programs in my district and elsewhere. One of Yosemite's highest priorities is to make these programs available to low income minority communities, those who traditionally have little access to quality, science-based education programs. That's why I support their request, Mr. Chairman, for $1 million to develop more outreach programs for this population. I'm also requesting, and behind me I have a whole group of people who came and met with me this morning, and I was already prepared to come here and they asked could they come with me, so they're back there. I'm requesting $2 million for the Sonoma County Health Care Information Network. It's a network that integrates local health information in order to improve the quality of local health care. Mr. Chairman, the Sixth District of California is a leader in meeting the health and education needs of the 21st century, and that's because I've been able to work with them and to get the support from our Federal Government and from your Committee to give them the help they need to be successful. So I thank you very much, and I thank the Subcommittee. I look forward to working with you. I will prioritize these requests. [The information follows:] [GRAPHIC(S) NOT AVAILABLE IN TIFF FORMAT] Mr. Regula. Thank you. I know that you did get some help last year. Mrs. Woolsey. I did. You've been good. And I appreciate your work. Mr. Regula. We'll see. Thank you. ---------- Tuesday, March 27, 2001. NATIONAL CENTER FOR SOCIAL WORK RESEARCH WITHIN NIH WITNESS HON. ASA HUTCHINSON, A REPRESENTATIVE IN CONGRESS FROM THE STATE OF ARKANSAS Mr. Regula. Okay, Mr. Hutchinson from the great State of Arkansas. You're interested in the National Center for Social Work Research with NIH. Mr. Hutchinson. That's correct, Mr. Chairman, and thank you for this opportunity to present the case for this. This is legislation I'm sponsoring with Congressman Rodriquez. It would create the national center for social work research within---- Mr. Regula. So it's a new regulation you would hope to get? Mr. Hutchinson. That's correct, it's new authorization. Even though the authorization has not yet passed, I wanted to alert you to the fact that we have introduced this legislation, we'll be asking for support for funding it. And this is within the National Institutes of Health, but they do some social work research, but it's not organized toward a national center. Presently, there is limited funding available through NIH, but this would emphasize the importance and urgency of research on social problems from child abuse to juvenile violence. It would give researchers more guidance, it would change the hard data into effective policy recommendations. Funding appropriated to a national center for social work research would be used for grants to universities and other non-profit organizations to support ongoing research, national coordination and dissemination efforts and to cooperate with legislators of Government, every level. I think a national center is needed to address some very important issues. As a father of four and new grandfather, I am concerned about the next generation. And some questions that could be asked, why does our system not work better to prevent violence in our schools? Why has there been a increase in child abuse today over 50 years ago? Is there a reason for the occurrences of child abuse being on the rise? Are there societal pressures on parents that didn't exist even 10 years ago? What can we do to help these families? I don't have the answers to those questions. And I think that that is the reason this is needed, and I daresay with great respect for this panel that you might not have the answers to all of those questions. So social workers are the professionals who can give us insight into those areas. I was struck by a recent Rand health study on youth violence, which stated that ``to devise better programs, researchers need more information.'' Our Nation's young people are increasingly affected by violence, both as to its perpetrators and its victims. Many violence prevention programs aim to reverse this trend but few of them have been properly evaluated and even fewer have been shown to work. We need to learn what causes young people to become violent. Such information could provide the tools for legislators to make better policy decisions and aid parents, teachers and counselors in providing better care for these young people. Just this month, there's been two school shootings that we're all aware of in California, which has reminded us of the many dangers of ignoring children's needs. The alarming sequence of school shootings from Jonesboro, Arkansas, to Paducah, Kentucky, to Littleton, Colorado and scores of others cry out for a response. We find ourselves searching for answers that do not come easily, and we have to research the solutions, analyze them for our families, our community schools and interaction between the peers. To do that most effectively, they've got to have an understanding of the factors that lead to these tragedies, information social workers are compiling right now. But today's resources are limited. Policy makers lack the information that is needed, information that the social workers have. And the national center will provide this critical link. I can think of no one better qualified or in a better situation to evaluate this great need than the social workers who work with these children on a daily basis. It makes sense to put them to work on these public policy decisions. Social workers are problem solvers. They work to solve problems dealing with people's counseling needs, health care needs, treatment of mental and emotional disorders. So they are uniquely qualified to do research into this particular area. As the Subcommittee considers the fiscal year 2002 Labor and Education Appropriations Act, I respectfully request and encourage you to consider funding for a national center for social work research, ideally to be funded at our authorization level that's requested, but whatever that you believe fits within your budget, the highest level possible, I think it would be well deserving. Let me conclude with this. I'm a conservative, and sometimes conservatives don't jump into the social work arena. But whenever you look at the President's initiative on using faith based organizations, when you look at the arena of child abuse, when you look at juvenile violent crime, whenever you look at our investment in cancer research and things that are causing people to die, is it not incumbent upon us as conservatives to say, we ought to invest in research in the very societal problems that lead us this direction, and that give us this heartache in society. So I don't think we should neglect this area of community, of family, of what we can do as policy makers. And this would coordinate it, rather than just being out there all over the globe, we need to put it in a focused fashion in the National Institutes of Health, tell them to elevate this to a higher priority, because we need some help in solving these problems. [The information follows:] [GRAPHIC(S) NOT AVAILABLE IN TIFF FORMAT] Mr. Regula. And your bill does that, I assume? Mr. Hutchinson. That's exactly what the bill does. Mr. Regula. Questions? Mr. Cunningham. Mr. Cunningham. Asa, my wife drug me to an event this weekend. Remember Peter Yarrow? Peter Yarrow is a good friend of David Obey as well, Peter, Paul and Mary. Maybe you remember that name. Mr. Hutchinson. That I remember. [Laughter.] Mr. Cunningham. He was, I thought, well, this guy is a left wing anti-military guy and I didn't want to go. But I'll tell you what, he's got a program called Don't Laugh at Me for children, and it is fantastic. I think he's a fantastic individual. I've got the tape and the things, I'll let you look to it. It may be something that we can get a copy for you. But it talks about the very things you're doing. I was 100 percent sold, once I saw the program. Mr. Hutchinson. Good. And you're a wise man to go where your wife leads you. [Laughter.] Mr. Regula. Thank you. As I assume, you want to pull information that's being developed in many disparate sources into once center, so there's a focus of it, which then would be able to communicate this out to the public? Mr. Hutchinson. Absolutely. To coordinate what is going on out there, to beef it up, to analyze it a little bit more,to get the information to the people who are making the decisions, to give us more hard data as the Rand study indicated. Again, cancer research would be a good example of that, women's health issues, you know, once you coordinate it, it gets more focused and directed. We need to do this in the social work arena. Mr. Regula. Have you presented your bill to the authorizers yet? Mr. Hutchinson. Oh, absolutely. And Congressman Fred Upton is, I believe, going to put a package together or children's health bill, or a public health bill. Mr. Regula. This is the Education and Work Force Committee, then? Mr. Hutchinson. Correct. So this would be a component, I believe, of what they will do---- Mr. Regula. Oh, part of the Commerce Committee, Energy and Commerce. Mr. Hutchinson. Yes. But we have worked with them and I'm very hopeful that this will move forward. Mr. Regula. Okay, well, thanks for coming this morning. Mr. Hutchinson. Thank you. ---------- Tuesday, March 27, 2001. VARIOUS PROGRAMS AND PROJECTS WITNESS HON. JOE BACA, A REPRESENTATIVE IN CONGRESS FROM THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA Mr. Regula. Mr. Baca, various programs and projects, from California. Welcome. Mr. Baca. Thank you very much, Mr. Chairman, for granting me an opportunity to discuss the importance of education and social issues and needs of the 42nd Congressional district. As you are aware, and my colleagues, I am deeply honored to testify before you. I believe that this Subcommittee handles some of the most important issues facing our Nation, and especially my district. I have submitted a more detailed written statement of my actual requests. Mr. Regula. It will be made a part of the record, obviously. Mr. Baca. Thank you. Education is a top priority for my district, for myself, and has been since I served in the legislature in California and continues to be here. I share with you in my belief that every student should have an opportunity that he or she should be whatever they want to be. As the President indicated, that no child should be left behind, that means having good quality education, encouraging students to stay in school, to go to college, to graduate from school. Many of the appropriations requests I am submitting for reading instruction, mentoring, teaching training, are designed to address these goals, including student retention, crucial issues in my district. Health issues is one important priority in my district. I've submitted to the Subcommittee venues in Congress seeking for funding for drug and alcohol treatment for youth age 12 to 17. Sometimes we forget that a lot of our youth in that area are not receiving the funding especially as it pertains to drugs and alcohol. It's important we put our top priority into supporting individuals. I've supported this legislation in the State legislature. I hope that we can support that kind of legislation to really address teenage drinking and alcohol, especially as it pertains to a lot of us and the effects it has in our schools, especially what's going on, too, as we look at what's going on. Expanding the Healthy Family programs in California to include indigent adults, supporting health care for seniors and children, fighting against breast cancer, license plate funding program, supporting prostate cancer, diabetes research and treatments are also important priorities, which require Federal funds which I am requesting this year. Specifically, I am also requesting funding for San Bernardino Community College district, in my district, we're multi-campus, providing KVCR television station owned by the district for $21 million for digital conversion and expansion of operations, studio space, for $35 million to $42 million for moving the KVCR facility to a more desirable location. Last year you granted me $1.7 million to obtain for distant learning. This is very important, especially as we see community colleges right now. Most of our students are going to community colleges, they can't into four year institutions. And KVCR, through its digital program, is doing a lot more of the outreach and providing educational services. We need to make sure they continue to provide an opportunity, especially as we look at students right now that are trying to get into our four year institutions and can't get in to our State colleges and universities. This is an avenue that can be done through KVCR telecommunications in providing not only classes that they can take and outreach, but also assuring that we provide the facilities. I think this is very important for our area as well. I'm also requesting $500,000 for Fontana Unified School District for subsequently retrofitting an ADA improvement to the civic auditorium, a facility that is utilized by hundreds and thousands of students in the City of Fontana, purchased a building in 1985, this is high priority funding and retrofitting which I think is very important for us. While also the capacity to the city, it has capacity only of 1,000 but we need to continue to improve and provide subsequent retrofitting for that area. I'm also requesting $3 million for the City of Ranch Cucamonga, which I share along with Dreier and Miller that were surrounded in that area to design and construct a new senior citizen center that provides 25 to 30 square feet. The city is providing matching funds of $2 million for land and ongoing maintenance and operation cost. For the City of San Bernardino, I'm requesting $1.5 million for the city to support job training for the city on one stop career center. This request is strongly supported by the civic and business groups in my district, along with Congressman Lewis. Mr. Chair, I have many other projects that I've outlined specifically, the California University at San Bernardino, San Bernardino County Superintendent of Instruction Schools, San Bernardino County Unified School District, the University of California at Riverside, with an incubator that's important to our area, as we look at providing jobs and getting universities. It's the only university in that area that is supported not only by myself, Ken Calvert, Mary Bono, Miller and also Congressman Lewis support the project for funding in that area, even though it's not in my district, but it's the only university within that area, and I think it's our responsibility to provide assistance to them. These are but a few of the many projects that I have submitted requests for you. You have specific details on the others, Mr. Chairman. I thank you for giving me the opportunity to come before you. I know it is a long list and a wish list of many areas. But I believe it's important that I represent my district, submit those requests and whatever possible can be funded, I would appreciate very much if the Committee would be able to look at some of the important projects to improve the quality of life, education and health in our area. [The information follows:] [GRAPHIC(S) NOT AVAILABLE IN TIFF FORMAT] Mr. Regula. Questions? Thank you for coming. You do have a substantial list. Mr. Baca. Thank you, Mr. Chair. I look forward to your continued support, and I'm not shy. [Laughter.] ---------- Tuesday, March 27, 2001. CLOSE UP FOUNDATION AND PROJECTS WITNESS HON. DONALD M. PAYNE, A REPRESENTATIVE IN CONGRESS FROM THE STATE OF NEW JERSEY Mr. Regula. Mr. Payne, New Jersey. I'm sorry, Don, I got you out of order here. Mr. Payne. Well, I may not get an extra program, then. [Laughter.] Mr. Regula. Pretty high price you're asking. Mr. Payne. Thank you. It's certainly a pleasure to be here, Chairman Regula. Let me just start by saying that our city of Newark, New Jersey is really on the rebound, it's coming back. We had a civil disorder in 1967 that really is the dividing point as we look at history in Newark. And because of support that we've gotten from your Committee, we've been going in the right direction over the last decade. Mr. Regula. Are you getting a new airport there, or a lot of pretty major---- Mr. Payne. Yes, pretty major, the road construction funding has just made it, actually, it's the third largest airport now, it's overtaken Kennedy and JFK, I mean, JFK and the other New York air, LaGuardia. Mr. Regula. Is it a hub at this point for any of the airlines? Mr. Payne. Yes, Continental, which has gained a lot of strength and health now, and is doing an excellent job to overseas, South America. Mr. Regula. We left out of there for the---- Mr. Payne. That's right, it's a great place. So anyone who's traveling, at least come through Newark. We have a little city tax on it, you know. But it's great to be here. I'll be brief. We have some health projects, the Emergency Medical Services demonstration project, the Children's Health Care Services and Outreach Center, and Babyland Family Services. What the coordinated Emergency Medical Services demonstration project is, it's a project to bring together transportation and emergency services in older cities. This is a very vital need. So we have, we're asking for $5 million to help with this demonstration project. Of course, the details are in the packets. The second one is the Newark Children's Health Care Service and Outreach Center. It's to positively impact on the health of Newark's children through the development of a coordinated health care system that will allow the city to bring health care services to the community. Through the centralization of services, we believe that we can increase access to an array of health and social service needs to Newark's citizens. We ask for $2.5 million for that. And thirdly, the Babyland Family Services is a major non- profit child and family service organization, providing comprehensive child care and family development services to 1,500 at-risk children and their families annually. Babyland is seeking additional funding to establish the technological linkages to nurture the educational development of almost 700 children, provide computer training for 2000 parents, teachers and entry level professionals. We're asking $2 million there. Just quickly, at the UMDMJ, we have a series of programs that we're asking. One is elimination of health disparity, and they have a very well focused program. We're asking for $5 million over a five year period. There is also a cancer institute center, the Dean and Betty Gallow Prostate Cancer Center. Dean Gallow is a former member of this Subcommittee, unfortunately passed away from prostate cancer. His widow, Betty Gallow, has been carrying the work on that Dean started. So we're asking for $10 million to assist in that project, which has become extremely successful. I'll conclude there, but there is one national program that I am making a request for, Mr. Chairman, it's the Close Up Foundation, civic education fellowship program. As you know, the Close Up Foundation is a civic educational program that brings students from around the country to our Nation's capital to study about government. It's been around for quite a while. As you know, we need all the help we can get in civic education and responsibility. We see what's happening at our high schools and elementary schools in our country. As a former teacher and coach, I didn't coach in the Army, but I coached in high school, we really see the need for these kinds of programs, bringing youngsters to our Nation's capital, stressing civic education, which I think is missing in a lot of our school systems. So with that, we'll submit our full text and I appreciate, like I said before, the previous support and look for continued support. [The information follows:] [GRAPHIC(S) NOT AVAILABLE IN TIFF FORMAT] Mr. Regula. Thank you. Questions? Mr. Cunningham. Don, the Close Up Program, that's not the one that recently had controversy with Reverend Jackson, is it? Mr. Payne. No, not to my knowledge, no. It's really a program that has a lot of support from business, but we do need to have our Federal support. But to my knowledge, this is not that program. Mr. Cunningham. Okay, thank you, Don. Mr. Payne. Thank you very much. Mr. Regula. Thank you for coming. ---------- Tuesday, March 27, 2001. PROJECTS WITNESS HON. ROBERT SCOTT, A REPRESENTATIVE IN CONGRESS FROM THE COMMONWEALTH OF VIRGINIA Mr. Regula. Mr. Scott, from the great State of Virginia. Mr. Scott. Thank you, Mr. Chairman and members of the Committee. I appreciate the opportunity to speak with you today. To save time, Mr. Chairman, you have the testimony and I want to just speak very briefly on two projects, the Massey Cancer Center at the Medical College of Virginia, and the Achievable Dream Program in Newport News, Virginia. The Massey Cancer Center, Mr. Chairman, is a building, a $26 million project. We're requesting $2.8 million from appropriations. The board of directors will be raising $10 million to $15 million. Mr. Regula. Is this a private non-profit? Mr. Scott. I'm sorry? Mr. Regula. Is it a private, non-profit school? Mr. Scott. The Medical College of Virginia is a State college. It's part of the Virginia Commonwealth University. Mr. Regula. Right. Mr. Scott. It's a $26 million program. The board of directors will be raising $10 million to $15 million, and we have received previous requests of $1.2 million, and we hope to receive the remaining $2.8 million to complete the project. The center is one of 59 national cancer institute programs, and it's an excellent program, Mr. Chairman, and I would hope that staff will read the details on it, and it's one that we're very much interested in. They have an outreach program going into the rural areas where they've had a significant impact on incidence of cancer and success in treating cancer from the Medical College of Virginia, going out into rural areas. The Achievable Dream Program is an education program consisting of teaching at-risk students at an elementary and middle school. Basically they have as kind of a hook, you come in and play tennis in the afternoon during the summer, education in the morning, then they go into the full year-round session. It's basically an inner city school. They have extra curricular and character building activities. They have shown that the program works. Their test scores are at or above the city average, and we have some areas where there are very high income students, very low income students. These low income students are at or above, in some cases way above, the city average. They receive significant support from the community, an average of about $1,800 per student. We're asking for $1.5 million from funds for the improvement of education so that we can start an early childhood center for three to four year olds. The earlier you start, the much better you can do. This is a very successful program, and we hope we can have your continued support. [The information follows:] [GRAPHIC(S) NOT AVAILABLE IN TIFF FORMAT] Mr. Regula. Questions? Mr. Cunningham. Mr. Cunningham. Bobby, we have a teaching hospital in San Diego for medicine, and it's just about to fold. With the HMOs, California is a leader in HMOs, yes, we do need HMO reform. But are you having those similar problems with the teaching hospitals and the training of doctors? A, the number that are requesting medical school has gone down, secondly, that they're having trouble funding it. Mr. Scott. A significant portion of the patient load is Medicaid, Medicare. So the reduced reimbursements are squeezing all of the hospitals, particularly the teaching hospitals, because they're open to everybody. So anybody that comes in, they're going to deal with. It's a major strain. Mr. Cunningham. I think across the Nation we're having trouble, and we're going to have trouble having good doctors, I think, in the future, unless we attend to it. Thank you. Mr. Scott. Thank you. ---------- Tuesday, March 27, 2001. CLEVELAND BOTANICAL GARDEN (PROJECT) WITNESS HON. STEPHANIE TUBBS-JONES, A REPRESENTATIVE IN CONGRESS FROM THE STATE OF OHIO Mr. Regula. Next, from the great, great State of Ohio, Stephanie Tubbs-Jones. Stephanie, you're going to speak on behalf of the Cleveland Botanical Garden. Ms. Tubbs-Jones. That's correct. If you'll allow me to stray for just a moment, I want to bring you greetings from my predecessor, the Honorable Congressman Louis Stokes. Mr. Regula. He was here in person last week. Ms. Tubbs-Jones. Oh, really? Did he tell you about us naming a post office after his mom, and how great it was? Well, doggone it, I'll have to tell him he preempted me. Mr. Regula. About everything I see in Cleveland has been named after him. We're running out of streets. Ms. Tubbs-Jones. I think so. [Laughter.] I'm just trying to hold my name out there. I can't get the streets and the buildings, but I'm doing okay. Mr. Chairman, thank you very, very much for the opportunity to present this morning. I'm here on behalf of the Cleveland Botanical Gardens. This is our fiscal year 2002 request, to secure $1 million in Federal funds to enable the Cleveland Botanical Garden to develop interactive ecological exhibits and educational materials for students from kindergarten through 12th grade and their families. You have all this information in your packet. I thinklast year when I presented, you had the opportunity to taste right from downtown salsa, which is a salsa that is produced by the students who grow tomatoes at this facility and surrounding facilities. What the botanical gardens has attempted to do is let young people in Cleveland's school districts and surrounding school districts have an understanding of ecology, an understanding of preserving the environment. So in this next step, we've already begun the funding of a glass house, but what the next step will allow us to build, two ecological systems, one like that exists in Costa Rica, where you have high ground properties, where people will be able to come through and interact with the activities, similar to probably some of the rainforest and other areas. But the other areas have focused on the lowlands, and we're going to focus in on the highlands. I could be very detailed in my presentation, but I know you don't want me to be, so I will not. But I come here to say that this is a project that's very important to my Congressional district, but also important to the region and the area and the State of Ohio. I appreciate all the support that you gave me last year, and in my second term as now a sophomore member of Congress, no longer a freshwoman, I'm here to say I need your help again, and any additional information that I can supply you, I'll be glad to do so, and I thank you for the opportunity to be heard. [The information follows:] [GRAPHIC(S) NOT AVAILABLE IN TIFF FORMAT] Mr. Regula. I think I got a note that they're doing long distance learning from there. Ms. Tubbs-Jones. That's correct. In fact, the director of the program would be here, but he's in Costa Rica, because we're doing exchange programs with children from Ohio and children from Costa Rica. It's a pretty exciting opportunity and a collaboration between Case Western Reserve University, the Botanical Gardens and the University of Costa Rica. Mr. Regula. Questions? You got some support for this last year, I believe. Ms. Tubbs-Jones. Yes, sir, and if I didn't say it, I thought I did, thank you for last year's support, and I'm back again. Anything else you can give me, I'd appreciate it. Mr. Regula. I'm not surprised. [Laughter.] ---------- Tuesday, March 27, 2001. LUPUS RESEARCH AND CAREGIVERS AND PROJECTS WITNESS HON. CARRIE P. MEEK, A REPRESENTATIVE IN CONGRESS FROM THE STATE OF FLORIDA Mr. Regula. Our next guest is Carrie Meek from Florida. Carrie, we're glad to have you, an also a member of our Full Committee. Mrs. Meek. Thank you, Chairman Regula, and all my friends on this Committee. I'm pleased to be here today. It's regarding a program in which I'm very, very interested and very concerned. I want to testify this morning on my highest funding priorities for fiscal year 2002. I understand you have a very awesome responsibility and you don't have the resources that you really need to meet some of these responsibilities. But we'll have to do the best we can. There are some issues that I'm interested in, and I know the time is limited, so I want to submit the rest of my testimony for the record. Mr. Regula. Without objection. Mrs. Meek. My number one priority, Mr. Chairman, is increased funding for lupus. Each of you is aware of this disease, we've been before your subcommittee for many years. And thank God, it was authorized last year, through Chairman Bilirakis' committee. It was a very long fight. It is something that I come before this Subcommittee to ask you, now that it's authorized, will you please fund it to the point that we can stop the killing and the maiming of this disease of young women? I'd like to request $30 million for the Centers for Disease Control to fund a grant program authorized under Title V, Subtitle B of Public Law 106-505. It's the Public Health Improvement Act of 2000, for treatment and support services for lupus patients and their families. This is a little bit different from the rest of the things you've been doing for us. Through the years, you have each year provided some funding for lupus. Now we're asking you to provide funding to support the lupus patients, in that they have a very, very hard time with their physical bodies being naturally undermined by this disease. I also request $25 million in additional research funding over and above the enacted 2001 level on the Title V, to enable the National Institutes of Arthritis, Musculoskeletal, and Skin Diseases, you call it NIAMS, to conduct expanded research to understand the causes and to find a cure for lupus. First of all, there is no cure for lupus. The treatment for lupus many times is just as harmful to the patient as is the lupus itself. The third thing is, if you continue the research, sooner or later you will get to the cause and a cure for this disease. Now, it's very important to me that we find a cure for lupus, and find a cure for the suffering that people go through. My sister died of lupus, a lot of young women die of lupus in their child bearing years. I've been urging the Congress to direct NIAMS and NIH to mount an all-out campaign against lupus. Now, rest assured that this is not to say that they have not been working hard on this. Except that they need more resources to do the support service, they need more researchers, more resources to do the research as well. Now, this is a killer. It's an autoimmune disease and it kills more people than HIV-AIDS and most of the other autoimmune diseases. It's really significant for women to focus on this disease, because about 1.4 million Americans have some form of lupus, and most of them are women. Many of these victims, if you've ever seen anyone or talked to anyone with lupus, the pain is very debilitating. The women aren't even able to hold their own children. Suffice it to say, Mr. Chairman and members of the Committee, I'm asking for $30 million for the Centers for Disease Control to fund a grant program which will support lupus patients. I'm requesting $25 million in additional research funding. That's going to NIAMS, which is a part of the National Institutes of Health. These groups have done an outstanding job, and if anyone can beat this diseases, it's those two. The most discouraging thing is that the family members suffer so from this particular disease. My second priority, Mr. Chairman, is a demonstration project to develop and test HIV-AIDS prevention, a media campaign. We brought it before the Committee last year, they thought it was a good idea, but they didn't fund it. What we'd like to do is a demonstration project to develop and test on HIV-AIDS. We know that the media program has worked with cigarettes. It has worked with HIV. But I'm requesting this now, and you know the drug program has worked. Every time you see one of those very well thought out drug programs regarding children, you will see that it's very, very effective. I'm requesting $10 million for the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention to develop and implement a grass roots minority HIV-AIDS prevention media campaign. That would be modeled after the $185 million the Congress spent on anti-drug media programs for the National Office of Drug Control. Funding for it would be used to develop and test the effectiveness of the HIV-AIDS prevention media campaign in 20 United States counties with the greatest number of minority HIV infections. I won't prolong that. Each of you is aware of the propensity of HIV-AIDS to kill and to maim the population. Third, Mr. Chairman and members, $15 million to fund the Higher Education Demonstration Projects, which will ensure equal opportunities for individuals with learning disabilities. Now, you all have heard of learning disabilities in youngsters from K-12. And a lot is done for them. Very little is done for youngsters who get out of high school and go to college and have learning disabilities. And to say that means that they need support as well as the younger persons do. It's one that shows you that you'd be surprised that a number of youngsters who go to college with learning disabilities, they don't read very well, most of them are very bright students. But they have these learning disabilities, and the teachers are not really capable of being able to understand how to teach these young people, nor do they understand what these learning disabilities are. So I'm urging the Committee to include $15 million to fund the grant program currently authorized. We were able to get this program authorized about two years ago here in the Congress through the Labor HHS Committee, and we were able to get it funded at $5 million for the entire country. But think of all the students who are enrolled in institutions of higher education who need these services and cannot get them. So as I understand it, each year a million dollars has been placed in that program to take care of some of the needs. I'm sure you realize that $1 million more each year certainly would not put that program where it should be. What this does, it identifies college students with learning disabilities and develops effective techniques for teaching these students. I think it's very fair that we think of the fact that we are really developing our students, and just because they have a learning disability doesn't mean that they're not bright. I think if you note, Einstein was learning disabled. That just gives you one example of the kind of student you're dealing with with learning disabilities. They're very bright students. University professors have found the research that has developed as a result of this program has been very helpful, helping them to teach students in higher education. My next one, Mr. Chairman, I listed them all for the Committee to look at, increased funding for community health centers. I support an increase in funding for the consolidated health centers program by at least $175 million for fiscal year 2002 in order to provide an inexpensive way to get high quality, affordable primary health care to under-served communities. Now, just take my State of Florida. There are 2.5 million people who have no regular source of primary care. Most of these people are in urban inner city areas like my home community in Miami, and in isolated rural areas. They do need better health care. And of course, the community health care centers is one that can provide that kind of help to people. The last one has to do with please increase funding for graduate medical education for pediatric hospitals to $285 million, the fully authorized level. You say, well, Carrie, that's really asking for a lot. You made a good start in your funding for pediatric graduate medical education the last time. But this is one of the areas of health care which has been overlooked for a very long time. We should take the next step by moving as quickly as possible toward funding at the fully authorized level. And I want to thank the Chairman and the members of the Committee for your patience in listening to the list of things I've brought before you. I'm sure that you will look at them in such a way as will meet the needs of the people of this country. I think of all the things we deal with here in the Congress, health is one of our most important ones, and I thank the Committee for having me appear before you. [The information follows:] [GRAPHIC(S) NOT AVAILABLE IN TIFF FORMAT] Mr. Regula. Thank you. Questions? Thank you, Carrie. Did you get that building down there that we had a couple of years ago and name it after the President, the college? Mrs. Meek. No, you wanted to name it after me, that's why they didn't build it, I think. Mr. Regula. Did they build it? Mrs. Meek. Yes, they did. Mr. Regula. They didn't name it after you, though? Mrs. Meek. No, they did not. Mr. Regula. Well, we'll have to---- Mrs. Meek. We'll have to take the money back, Mr. Regula. [Laughter.] Mr. Regula. Has it been named yet? Mrs. Meek. No, not yet. Mr. Regula. Maybe we can address that problem. Mrs. Meek. All right, thank you so much. ---------- Tuesday, March 27, 2001. MEDICARE AND HEALTH CARE FINANCING ADMINISTRATION WITNESS HON. PETE STARK, A REPRESENTATIVE IN CONGRESS FROM THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA Mr. Regula. Mr. Stark from California. Mr. Stark. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. Do you have any leftover buildings in the 13th Congressional District in Northern California? Maybe Duke and I could work something out. Mr. Regula. No money. Mr. Stark. No money, okay. [Laughter.] Well, if I were just to build the sign that goes over the door, could I contribute that? Thank you for giving me the opportunity to address you this morning, Mr. Chairman, members. I hope you'll take my complete statement for the record, and just let me summarize it for you. As the Chair recalls, for 10 years, I guess, I chaired the health subcommittee of the Ways and Means Committee. It has since been chaired both by Mr. Chairman Thomas and now Mrs. Johnson. I believe we are all in accord on this, and we have all had our disagreements with HCFA. Under the 10 years that I chaired the Committee HCFA was under Republican, under a Republican Administration, it's been under a Democratic Administration when Mr. Thomas was there. The reports have been late, we've had complaints from doctors and hospitals, you've all had complaints in your Congressional districts. But the truth is, in all of that time, we have been able to say, as we speak to people across the country, that they're operating the Medicare operation a couple of hundred billion dollars a year with a 2 percent overhead. There's not an insurance company in the world, Blue Cross and Kaiser maybe come to 12 percent, that could operate on 2 percent. And some of the more expensive insurance companies that are doing the same thing, 14, 18 percent. And it's these same insurance companies, Blue Cross, that do a preponderance of the work under the supervision of HCFA for distributing these payments. Think about this. Today, Medicare beneficiaries will make a million physician visits. This is not just hospitals. This is going to the doctor. A million visits. And Medicare will process more than 3 million claims today and spend a billion bucks. That's what we're doing every day. And we're doing this on their share of the budget, about $2.2 billion for program management. The graph will show, Mr. Chairman, that this is in real dollars, the dotted line down here, and it's only in the past year that we've gotten up to 1993 expenditures. Now, what's wrong? Their computer system doesn't work. They haven't gotten up to the full time employee level that they were 10 years ago. We have been starving them. And since 1996, we gave 700 new legislative provisions for them to administer. Now, you can say we're cockeyed for doing that. My point is that we all do that. This is a Congressional mandate, and it's been under both parties and under both Administrations. The money, although you get scored for it, comes out of the trust fund. So those of us who want to protect the trust fund realize, but let me just tell you this. That it was in 1996 that we came out with this, or we didn't come out, we got this 14 percent of what we were spending. Again, let's say it's $2 billion a year. Twenty-eight billion of that was spent incorrectly. Now, some of the incorrect payments were fraud and abuse, and some were just mistakes, just filled out the form wrong, paid the check wrong, whatever we did. We were throwing away, if you will, in the 20s of billions of year. They have cut that, because of legislative provisions we mandated, to 6.8 percent. They have cut that in half. So they have saved $12 billion in six years by addressing the fraud provisions which we forced on them. Now, what I'm telling you, they're doing this, and they're still only spending $2 billion a year for administration, and the results of what they're doing have saved us $12 billion. So I'm just here saying, could we double their budget over a period of years and get them up to say, 4 percent of benefit spending. I don't know how much a new computer system is going to cost. It's in the dark ages. But you and I know that the phone company can find everybody, and our credit card people, Visa and Master Charge are more efficient than HCFA, and they're spending more to collect money from us. So that's my plea. I'll be glad to try and answer any questions. This is one of our better managed bureaucracies. [The information follows:] [GRAPHIC(S) NOT AVAILABLE IN TIFF FORMAT] Mr. Regula. Has mechanization helped, the computers and record keeping? Mr. Stark. Of course. And they're behind the curve. There's no question that mistakes were made, I'm trying to think of how many years ago it was, Mr. Chairman, they decided to do eight different computer programs around the country, because they felt they had to give eight different people a chance to bid on the work. How do you have eight different systems? Mr. Regula. Do they still have more than one system? Mr. Stark. They have more than one. Because historically, when Medicare came into being, it was, the billing part of it was turned over mostly to Blue Cross people around the country. So every are has a different billing system. Because they have a different person, we actually contract out the majority of the work to people called intermediaries. We've got to change that. This is the 21st century. Mr. Regula. Are you saying change the contracting out, or changing the coordination? Mr. Stark. Changing the coordination, changing the method. There's a whole lot of modernization. But they've got to have the equipment and the personnel to do it. And I have great faith in Governor Thompson, a good administrator in my natal State of Wisconsin. But we've had good administrators right along. It's one of the biggest bureaucracies, as you know. Mr. Regula. It's a Herculean task. Mr. Stark. It is. And we can't starve them at the same time we're forcing more work down on them. As I say, I don't think we can find either a budgetary fight or a partisan fight on this issue. I know we don't get scored for the savings out of the fraud and abuse as opposed to directly. But it's there, and as I say, these are---- Mr. Regula. Do the intermediaries pick up fraud? Mr. Stark. They will trigger investigations, because they're the ones who can understand patterns. But each intermediary, the problem is, has a different way of judging. In other words, certain screening tests, that would call for surgery or certain screening tests that would call for more clinical tests could differ. One area of the country might pay for bone marrow and another might not. Don't ask me why. This is just the historical way they have done this. So there's a lot we can accomplish. But for us to begin to proceed more rapidly, which we should do, is going to take people and--the sheer volume, the complexity of all the different medical procedures. And one of these days, we're probably going to get into pharmaceuticals, and that's just going to add another whole bunch of words and numbers and procedures that you and I wouldn't be able to spell or understand, but we would end up paying for. Mr. Regula. That's an enormous challenge. Mr. Stark. Yes. If you could find, as you push these numbers around, some there, I think that you will find the Republican Administration, the Democratic minority will move to help in any way we can. Mr. Regula. Pretty much a bipartisan issue. Mr. Stark. I believe so, Mr. Chairman. I certainly don't-- all I can tell you is that in the past years, the current chair and the now chair of the full Committee have supported efforts to see that HCFA gets better funding. Mr. Regula. Mr. Sherwood. Mr. Sherwood. I talked with Governor Thompson about this problem the other night. It's very real and we have to address it. We find that all over the Government, that our computer systems are not anywhere near up to date with the work we're trying to accomplish. And it costs us money in unusual ways, because of that. Mr. Stark. If the gentleman would yield, and this is the poster child of the type of operation that can save from computerization, because of the huge volume of small claims and forms that have to be filled out. As I say, we're all excited that Governor Thompson can do a good job over there, but I think we've got to give him the resources. Mr. Sherwood. I agree. Mr. Stark. I thank the gentleman for his concern. Mr. Regula. Thank you. Mr. Stark. I thank you for the opportunity to present the case here today, and I hope you can find a few dollars to help out this group. Thank you very much, Mr. Chairman. Mr. Regula. Thank you. ---------- Tuesday, March 27, 2001. CONGREGATE AND HOME-DELIVERED-MEALS PROGRAM WITNESS HON. CHRISTOPHER SHAYS, A REPRESENTATIVE IN CONGRESS FROM THE STATE OF CONNECTICUT Mr. Regula. Mr. Boehner. Mr. Boehner. I'll yield to my colleague who's in the middle of a hearing. Mr. Regula. Oh, all right, Mr. Shays, congregate and home delivered meals program. Mr. Shays. Thank you. He yielded on the agreement I'd be 30 seconds. I thank him very much. Mr. Chairman, just to make you aware of the fact that our congregate meal and our home delivered meals has been somewhat static, and there hasn't been a sense of-- Mr. Regula. Static in reimbursement, static in numbers? Mr. Shays. Funding, except in terms of adding a little bit to the congregate last year. But the bottom line is, I'm asking if you would restore $43 million to put $43 million into the congregate meal program to bring it to a total of $421 million, which would bring it to the funding level of 1995. The only point I want to make to you is that there have been unused funds in the congregate meal that have been unused by agencies, and they have built up a level of spending now so those unused funds from past years have been used up, and you're going to start to see around the country some significant deficits. Just an alert to you that you may need to take a look at it. [The information follows:] [GRAPHIC(S) NOT AVAILABLE IN TIFF FORMAT] Mr. Regula. Don't we get a lot of volunteers involved in this operation? Mr. Shays. Yes, it's great. You get a lot of volunteers, but this pays for the meals. You get a lot of volunteers who come to the congregate sites, a lot of volunteers who do the home delivered meals. It's a cost effective program. Mr. Regula. Do they get reimbursed mileage, because they drive their automobiles? Mr. Shays. I'm not even sure of that, sir. We just had a challenge in our district because what we found is they had built up to levels using past funds. They built up their spending level above the annual appropriations that exist. So the States made up the difference in Connecticut. But I suspect you may be having a problem around the country that will start to surface as people use past funds for present operations. Mr. Regula. Well, and of course, more seniors, too. Mr. Sherwood? Mr. Sherwood. No questions. Mr. Regula. Well, thanks. Mr. Shays. Thank you, and I thank my colleague for yielding. ---------- Tuesday, March 27, 2001. VARIOUS PROGRAMS WITNESS HON. JOHN A. BOEHNER, A REPRESENTATIVE IN CONGRESS FROM THE STATE OF OHIO Mr. Regula. Mr. Boehner. Mr. Boehner. Hello, Mr. Chairman. I'm glad to be here this morning. Mr. Regula. What will you be doing to our budget over there in your committee? Mr. Boehner. We'll be working very closely with you. Good morning and thanks for the opportunity to be here. Let me say hello to my friend and the newest member of your Committee, Mr. Sherwood. It's nice to see that you're here. And I appreciate the job that you all have in terms of trying to decide how to allocate the biggest chunk of the Appropriations Committee. It is a difficult choice. I'm here today as chairman of the Education and Work Force Committee to really outline our priorities. I think the President has done a good job in his proposal on education, which is embodied in a bill that we introduced last week, H.R. 1. And the effort there is to close the achievement gap that exists between disadvantaged students and their peers, and to work with States to improve the schools to be the best in the world. I could talk about the President's education proposal, but you all understand it fairly clearly. More flexibility in terms of consolidating programs, in allowing schools to have more flexibility over how to use those resources in their schools. Secondly, actually doing a better job of targeting the money to the schools who need it the most. And thirdly, putting into place a new reading program that is absolutely essential. Because if children can't read, they're not going to learn. We know that the early childhood reading program, and the President's proposal, will do a lot to improve reading scores, and we think, learning. Now, money is not the only issue here. We've spent $130 billion since 1965 on well intentioned, well meaning education programs. The fact is, we've gotten almost no results for the money we've invested. And what we need is a system of accountability and rededication of the Federal Government's commitment to helping those students who would otherwise fall through the cracks. Let me point out three issues that I think are most important on the education side. They're outlined in the authorization levels in our bill, H.R. 1, which is in effect the President's proposal. A $461 million increase in Title I, $320 million for the President's State assessment initiative for grades 3 through 8 in reading and math and thirdly, $975 million for the President's reading first and early reading program. When you look at what we're attempting to do over there in terms of providing for more accountability and more flexibility, we believe that, and targeting, targeting the money to these children who most need it, these three programs that we've outlined here are the core of making this work. I'd also ask that you find the resources to increase funding for IDEA. This Committee has done a marvelous job the last five years in increasing IDEA funding. The President's calling for increased funds, and I know that every member of Congress listens to what I listen to when I go home from every one of my school districts. And that's that IDEA needs more money. You should be aware that part of the President's request for his reading program and the early childhood reading program will in effect help with IDEA issues in local districts. That's because there are an awful lot of students that end up in IDEA because they can't read. To the extent we can solve this reading problem or address this reading problem, both the early childhood reading and the K-3 reading program, I think we'll take a big step in helping these school districts with their IDEA money issues. Secondly, in this area, the President has also asked for a billion dollar increase in Pell Grants. We all understand the need to continue the effort to increase the Pell Grants, to help those children, again, at the bottom of the economic ladder, who without that effort would never be able to attend post secondary education programs. And I think that again, you're getting a lot of requests, but I think we all understand the importance of the Pell Grant program. Let me switch gears and talk about the other side of my committee, and that would be the labor side. I support the President's plan to level fund the Department of Labor, especially in our enforcement areas. In the past, the DOL has had the habit of administering the Nation's labor and employment laws beyond what I believe the scope of what Congress intended. And I think taxpayers savings will arise from effectively protecting workers by properly enforcing important labor and employment laws. I would ask that you support the efforts of the Department of Labor's inspector general to better protect workers benefit funds and reduce waste, fraud and abuse that continues to exist there. So I thank you for the opportunity to be here and look forward to answering any questions that you might have. [The information follows:] [GRAPHIC(S) NOT AVAILABLE IN TIFF FORMAT] Mr. Regula. One of the components of the President's program is testing. Mr. Boehner. Correct. Mr. Regula. Do you anticipate that the Federal Government will fund these tests, even though the States develop them? Mr. Boehner. What the President proposed is that we, the Federal Government, assist the States in developing their tests. Under his proposal and under H.R. 1, the States will determine what tests to use in their States. Mr. Regula. I understand that. Mr. Boehner. But the actual implementation of it is left to the States. Now, this bill is going through committee here in the next month or month and a half. Whether we get into funds for the actual implementation of the test is yet to unclear. But Mr. Chairman, I think you understand that in virtually every school district in America, there's testing that goes on every year. Mr. Regula. Oh, yes. Mr. Boehner. And under the President's proposal, some States are already testing in every grade, reading and math. Others may be doing other tests. But frankly, I'm not so sure that when it's all said and done there's any additional testing that's going to result from the President's proposal. I believe that the requirement that we'll have in our bill, that we have annual assessments in reading and math in grades three through eight may in fact replace some other testing that's already being done. Mr. Regula. Staff just advised me, apparently the budget resolution withholds a $1.25 billion from this Committee, unless we appropriate a commensurate increase for special ed. Well, obviously that's going to squeeze what we have to do some of these other things that are embodied in your bill. Mr. Boehner. Sounds like a big issue between the Appropriations Committee and the Budget Committee. Mr. Regula. I've noticed that there's some discussion of that. You're going to be involved, too, because you're going to bring to us through authorization programs that cost money. Mr. Boehner. I'm confident that when the budget resolution gets through the House and the Senate and we come to conference, that all of these issues will be ironed out to our satisfaction, as they always are. Mr. Regula. That there will be adequate funding. Mr. Boehner. I'm convinced that there will be adequate funding. Even though the President has called for an overall increase in discretionary funding of about 4 percent, it is going to put pressure on all of you to make serious decisions about what needs to be funded. Mr. Regula. True. Very true. Mr. Boehner. But I think it's obvious from all the national polling that we see that education is the number one issue in the country. The President called for it during his campaign. He has devoted serious time to this over the last several months. And as we get the bill through our Committee and the Floor, and the Senate does theirs, I do expect that we will have a bill signed into law prior to your bill, your appropriations bill, being on the Floor. I would expect that Mr. Miller and I, the Ranking Democrat on the Committee, we expect to work closely with you as we move through this process. Mr. Regula. Mr. Sherwood. Mr. Sherwood. Mr. Chairman, I have great faith in your ability to work those things out. Mr. Boehner. So do I. Mr. Sherwood. But the assessment issue I think is so important. Because parents and students deserve to know where they stand in relation to other schools. I think our education establishment has tried to push that on the back burner, because they don't want the comparison and they worry about teaching towards the test and those sorts of things. Well, I think our college board tests and so forth have told us that if the test is well designed, there are tests that work. I like the President's proposal to bring assessment forward, testing forward. Mr. Boehner. Well, Mr. Sherwood, as a former school board member, you understand better than most, well, the Chairman's a former member of the education establishment, I might add, but the annual assessments really are important, because there's a big secret out there. The big secret is that about half of our kids just are not learning. Now, we've lost a generation of students in our country. We can keep looking the other way, and act like it doesn't exist. We can continue to allow the disease of low expectations to continue. But the people that get hurt the most are the people at the low end of the economic ladder in our country, the most disadvantaged of our children are the ones who are trapped and who will never succeed without an education. And although we've done all types of well intentioned programs out of here, the fact is that we need to start asking for results. And one of the issues that, and Mr. Miller and I are in much more agreement than most of you would ever guess about the direction of this bill, because the money needs to get to those students who most need it. Those schools in inner city neighborhoods and rural communities, they've got bigger problems. They need the extra funds in order to ensure that those kids get a decent education. But without the testing, without the bright light of truth being shone on what's happening in some of our buildings, I don't think we'll ever get there. Because there's a certain amount that we can do in terms of the Federal Government. But when you put the bright light on what's happening in these schools, it will energize communities, businesses, parents to get out of their easy chairs, get away from their TV and find out what in the world is happening in our schools. That is just as important as the change in direction that we're going to be proposing the next couple of months. Mr. Sherwood. Expectations are the key. Mr. Regula. Accountability. Mr. Boehner. That's it. We'll have plenty of time to talk about it as the year goes on. Mr. Regula. I think we'll hear from you in the future. Mr. Boehner. Thank you. ---------- Tuesday, March 27, 2001. HEALTH RESEARCH PROGRAMS WITNESS HON. CHRIS SMITH, A REPRESENTATIVE IN CONGRESS FROM THE STATE OF NEW JERSEY Mr. Regula. Mr. Smith, Chris, health research programs. Mr. Smith. Thank you very much. Mr. Chairman and members of the Committee, thank you for this opportunity to appear before the Committee. I would ask that my full statement be made a part of the record, Mr. Chairman. Thank you. Let me just say on last Congress, I formed, along with Congressman Ed Markey a caucus that now comprises 131 members and continues to grow in the area of Alzheimer's research. As all of us know, and many of us have had family members who have suffered the devastating impact of that disease, as we all know, it's not terminal, but it devastates not only the patient but also the family and especially the primary caregiver, who often, it turns out to be, is the spouse, raising serious questions about respite care. But the bottom line is that right now, there are about 4 million people who have Alzheimer's and many more thousands, tens of thousands, who are in the process of developing this devastating disease. It's estimated by the year 2050, 14 million people, today's baby boomers, will have Alzheimer's disease in those who are moving into that age category. So it's a ballooning epidemic, that if we don't marry up the necessary resources in research and trying to get to the cause and hopefully to solve it, to reverse it in those who have it and prevent it in those who do not have it, we're talking about a major---- Mr. Regula. Chris, I'm curious. Is this prevalent in other countries in somewhat the same degree that we have it? Mr. Smith. It's a very good question. Increasingly, it's recognized that Alzheimer's is a disease of aging. So where you have an aging population, and many of our developing countries, people simply don't make it into their 60s or 70s. It's estimated that anyone who's 85 or older, one out of every two, are in some part, one degree or another into Alzheimer's disease. So it is a function, to some extent, of our aging. Mr. Regula. It has parameters of degrees of severity, I assume, from what you are saying. Mr. Smith. Yes, there are. It's a progressive disease that gets progressively worse as the dementia and the plaques and everything else in the brain form. Mr. Regula. Then in turn have impact on the physical well being of the individual, is that correct? Mr. Smith. That's correct. It may not lead to, like we see with some diseases, a breakdown where the kidneys don't function. It doesn't do that. But it leads to an overall deterioration of the patient. They're not as viable. They certainly are not interacting. But primarily, if they exist and get worse and worse and worse, they very often just sit in a chair and do very little. They don't recognize family members. And the impact on the family members, because I've known so many of them, sometimes it's much harder for them, for a husband or wife to go spend time with their family member and they don't even recognize them. So we're asking on behalf of our coalition, of our caucus, for a $200 million increase to really declare war on this. There have been a number of very promising studies that have been done. They're all in one stage or another, and it seems to me that this is something we can lick if we again have enough resources. The second, if I could, because I know we--it's not a vote. The second is in the area of autism. I've been involved in the autism issue since elected to Congress 21 years ago. On and off, I always thought CDC-NIH were doing what they could do, inquiries that I would make over the years, particularly in the 1980s, suggested that yes, we're doing what we can. Three years ago, in one of my major cities, Brick Township, we discovered that there may be a cluster of autistic children. There seemed to be an elevated number, perhaps as much as double what the national average was expected to be, which is one out of every 500 children. We asked CDC to come in, we asked other people from ATSDR to come in and do a study. They did. They found out that indeed there was a four per thousand, a doubling of instances of autistic children in that area. From my contacts since and during that process, I have been astonished as to what we don't know about autism and how we have almost been frozen in time over the last 20 years doing very little to mitigate this disease. We don't know what causes it, we don't even know what the prevalence of this terrible disease is, the reporting that goes on in State after State is passive. Most States don't have a clue. To remedy that, last year I introduced legislation that became Title I in Mike Bilirakis' bill of the Centers of Excellence to get at the prevalence issue, but also to begin looking at what can we do, what triggers autism. We all know families who have had autistic children who are into their second and going into their third year, all of a sudden, bingo, their child can't communicate. And this developmental disorder, for whatever the trigger is, becomes very compulsive and again, they start down a course of expenses and tragedy, even though they love their children desperately, it is a heartbreak like few heartbreaks one can experience. We're asking for a very modest $5 million to try to, in addition to what's already been allocated, to try to, it would be for the Center for Birth Defects and Development Disabilities at CDC. We've scoped it out, we think it's a good idea. We ask you to take a look at it. More needs to be done without a doubt. New Jersey has taken the lead. We don't know why there seems to be an elevated number in New Jersey. If there is one. There may be no cluster. There may be a problem that is going on everywhere else, it's just been below the radar screen. And I would hope that you could take a look at this as well. [The information follows:] [GRAPHIC(S) NOT AVAILABLE IN TIFF FORMAT] Mr. Regula. Mr. Sherwood. Mr. Sherwood. No questions, Mr. Chairman. Mr. Regula. Well, I'm sure, Chris, both of these require attention. I think NIH is working on them, and as you know, there's been a commitment to double their budget over a five year period. And I assume the groups contact them, because they do allocate resources at NIH. We don't try to dictate just where they should do their work. Mr. Smith. I do understand that, and I think they have realized maybe belatedly, because they have such a full plate, just that this has been underfunded in the past and this is a problem overseas as well. In Poland, for example, I've been working with a group that's, they don't know how to deal with it. Some of our people, Johnson and Johnson has been active in this. There seems to be a gross under-reporting of these cases as well over there. I'm sure as we get into the surveillance and the prevalence issue, we're going to find that there's so much more that we don't know. The numbers are higher, and I say that as a tragedy. Just one final point. We have formed a caucus, Mike Doyle and I formed it this year, we have 101 members, and that's growing as well, to deal with the issue of autism. I know you'll be very sympathetic, and I look forward to working with you. Mr. Regula. Thank you for coming. Mr. Smith. Thank you, Mr. Chairman, Mr. Sherwood. Mr. Regula. We'll recess until 2:00 o'clock this afternoon. [Recess.] ---------- Afternoon Session Mr. Regula. Well, Wes, you are number one. ---------- Tuesday, March 27, 2001. PROJECTS WITNESS HON. WES WATKINS, A REPRESENTATIVE IN CONGRESS FROM THE STATE OF OKLAHOMA Mr. Watkins. First, let me say congratulations, Mr. Chairman to you, after many years of serving in the Interior. Well, you are still in the Interior, but you are just not the Chair over there. I appreciate the opportunity, and I appreciate all your work over all the years on the various committees, and especially Interior, and now as Chair of the Subcommittee on Labor and HHS. Mr. Chairman, you know, you have probably heard me over the years talk about our needs in the rural and economically depressed areas of the southeast Oklahoma quadrant. I have 21 counties in my district, and all of them are rural, and also the Tulsa area, which is doing well economically, and the big Oklahoma City metropolitan area. I have got a nick that goes in between, and then all of the southeast part. Mr. Regula. They do not have any oil, do they? Mr. Watkins. They have very little on the far west side. That touches very little of my overall district. But one thing that has not touched us is the fact that we have been left behind economically speaking, with all the manufacturing. I do not have a Fortune 500 company in my district. I have got some timber in one area that is warehoused, but I do not have big, huge manufacturing. I am a product of out-migration. When I was growing up, my family had to leave three times to go to California and search for jobs. That is what made the burning imprint on my life about going into public life, in order to try to build the economy and build jobs. As I have told people before, I am not in politics as an end, but politics as a vehicle. We are trying to change that. We have done some good, and we have still got a long way to go. The per capita income in my district is about 60 percent of the national average; not the top, but it is about 60 percent of the out-migration. Like I said, we have been doing some good. We have had to do a lot of things on our economic infrastructure. One of the things also that has happened to us is we have been passed by the high technology, the information technology, in that rural area of the state of Oklahoma. The big cities, again, are doing well. What I am trying to do, I am working with Career Tech. Career Tech is the state vocational technical education system all across the state of Oklahoma. I am working with them trying to work through the hub and provide the high tech potential in that area. We call it REVTECH. Last year, the committee provided $921,000. I am asking this year, Mr. Chairman, and I hope you will be able to help us, for about $1.25 million to help work with the State Department of Career Tech. That would allow us, in a lot of those different areas, to be able to provide the necessary wiring, the technology, et cetera, to be able to attract more people. For instance, I work with an industry that is up around Tulsa, but not in my district. They said they could hire 500 more people if they could find trained people. Well, I have got 500 people, but they are scattered throughout my area, if I can get them all together. So that is the one request that we have up at the top of the list. The other is the fact that for many years, I have worked on international trade. The reason for my commitment and dedication to international trade is the fact for every $1 billion of increase in trade, you actually produce about 20,000 jobs. So it makes a lot of sense. Mr. Chairman, I know your background is in rural areas, and some of it is in agriculture. I think, if I recall, you were out on the farm there. We are not going to save rural America just with agriculture alone. I say that with two degrees in agriculture. I love agriculture. But we have got to have off-farm jobs some way to be able to survive or to be able to re-build our small communities. We are working also on the international trade aspect of it at Oklahoma State University, our land grant university there. This committee helped last year with $320,000. I am asking, if you could, give us $750,000, or as close to that as you possibly can. The other thing that you worked with me on last year on the committee was Fragile X, and I am just asking for language as to the help on working with that. That is one of the things that has come along, that has dealt with the retarded. They have made some very scientific breakthroughs, and I have got some language in there for that. The other request, and I have had several others, but this other one is the one new one. It is the Seminole Junior College, or Seminole College. They have got dormitories, but there is some renovation that needs to take place there, if they are going to be able to continue to use them. I am trying to figure out how we can get that done. I have said to community there that I would do my best to try to help them with some renovation some way, if we possibly could. So that would be a big help to that community. Mr. Regula. Is that BIA operated? Mr. Watkins. No, it is not, but there are a large number of Native Americans there. In fact, Mr. Chairman, and you probably know this from your work with the Interior, Oklahoma has got the highest percentage of Native Americans of any state in the nation. In fact, close to 22 percent are in Oklahoma. Mr. Regula. Okay, we will look at them. Mr. Watkins. If you could help me, sir, I would appreciate it very, very much. This is a committee that I felt like there are some things there that maybe you could help us. I really would appreciate it. Mr. Regula. It will depend a lot on what we have available to work with. Mr. Watkins. Being on the Budget Committee, I am trying to do my best to let you have as much as we possibly can. Mr. Regula. We look forward to that, Wes. Mr. Watkins. We will keep pushing for it. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. Mr. Regula. Thank you. [The information follows:] [GRAPHIC(S) NOT AVAILABLE IN TIFF FORMAT] Mr. Regula. Ms. Mink, I see you have various programs, too. ---------- Tuesday, March 27, 2001. VARIOUS PROGRAMS WITNESS HON. PATSY T. MINK, A REPRESENTATIVE IN CONGRESS FROM THE STATE OF HAWAII Mrs. Mink. I brought a very modest list. [Laughter.] Thank you, Mr. Chairman. I do not know how long my voice is going to last, so may I just ask unanimous consent that my testimony be inserted in the record. Mr. Regula. Yes, all the testimony will be included in the record. Mrs. Mink. I also brought with me a letter which 85 members have signed with respect to the ovarian cancer research. I believe you are familiar with my annual trek to this committee, urging that more funds be committed to this research. Mr. Regula. That would be through the NIH. Mrs. Mink. Yes, that is correct. I remember when I started this campaign for funding for research in this area, that the NIH was only spending $7 million. Today, it is up around $70 million, but we need a lot more. It is a very tragic situation where the situation of our research has not come to a point where an early detection test has been found. I believe they are close to it, but until we can find a satisfactory detection for ovarian cancer, we are going to continue to lose many, many thousands of young women. A lot of the women who come down with this are in their mid-to- late 30s. It is very, very tragic. About 23,000 women are diagnosed each year. Most of them are in their late stages, where they cannot be saved. So the mortality every year is about 14,000, which is the highest in the reproductive illnesses. So I think it really takes a determined effort on the part of this committee to recognize the enormous situation that women are in today. There are no symptoms for ovarian cancer, usually, that the doctors can detect by physical examination or by pain or other kinds of things. So unless we have a test, it is not going to be possible to save these lives. So the research is really very, very critical. My bill that I have circulated in the House with about 115 co-sponsors asks for a $150 million commitment. I hope that this committee will find the necessary funds to make that possible. The other institute which I feel needs to have real attention is the National Eye Institute. We are not aware of how many people in America suffer from eye diseases. We need to spend more money on research, money to determine why these illnesses occur, and what can be done to alleviate this condition. Some of it has to do with diabetes and other kinds of related illnesses. But the NEI, which is a separate institute, the National Eye Institute, is currently funded at $510 million. This year, I am hoping that you will be ableto go up to $604 million for this institute. Last year, we had put in a bill asking for the funding to be doubled in at least five years, and we are marching steadily ahead. So I hope that the progress that we have gained in the last several years will not be stayed in any way, and that we will continue. The last item is one that relates to education funding. We are really absolutely transfixed on the fact that our young people are killing each other in our schools for almost no understandable reason. A lot of them are from middle class neighborhoods, coming from well stationed families, without any clear evidences of problems in their homes. The Speaker, Mr. Hastert, established a task force last year on school violence. I was fortunate enough to serve on that. Most of us had various approaches to it. But the one thing that we agreed on was the necessity for having additional staff put into our schools, particularly in the intermediate years. We do not want to call them counsellors, because they already have categories for those people. We do not want to call them social workers or whatever. So we came up with the title, school-based resource staff. The schools could then pick whatever kind of personnel they felt suited for their particular school situation. But what we want to do is to get a ratio of one of these resource staff people per every 250 students. That is still a high ratio, but we think that is a starting point. In order to get there, Mr. Chairman, we have a target of 100,000 additional school-based personnel. I hope you will come up with the funding necessary to support it. Mr. Regula. Would you contemplate 100 percent of that being Federally financed? Mrs. Mink. Yes, 100 percent; it is like 100,000 teachers, to phase them in. But the target is 250 to one ratio, ultimately. Some schools already have that. So they would not be getting into this particular fund. But for those school districts that do not have these extra personnel to take care of handling the students, this is not the chore of the curriculum-type person or the vice principal, who has to do administrative work, or worry about discipline and those kinds of things. This is a school personnel individual that is there solely and exclusively to deal with the students, so they can go to someone with their problems; or if they hear something about someone making some outrageous statements or threats, they can go to this individual, without the fear of peer pressure and so forth. They can go to this individual and tell us staff person what they heard, and let the staff person decide to what level that should be taken. We think that this is a position that the Federal Government can take very, very easily. Our task force that the Speaker appointed unanimously agreed that this is a step that must be taken. So I thank you very much for your consideration. Mr. Regula. Thank you for coming, Patsy. [The information follows:] [GRAPHIC(S) NOT AVAILABLE IN TIFF FORMAT] Mr. Regula. Next is Billy Tauzin from the great state of Louisiana. Boy, you are just getting warmed up down there on your celebrating, are you not? Mr. Tauzin. Lent time is a time for rest. Mr. Regula. So you are resting now, is that it? [Laughter.] Mr. Tauzin. We are paying for our sins. Mr. Regula. Well, you need more than 40 days. Mr. Tauzin. Actually, 40 is a good start. ---------- Tuesday, March 27, 2001. VARIOUS PROGRAMS WITNESS HON. BILLY TAUZIN, A REPRESENTATIVE IN CONGRESS FROM THE STATE OF LOUISIANA Mr. Tauzin. Mr. Chairman, thanks for having me. I bring to you today a young friend of mine who has been before the committee for three years now. His name is Keith Andrus. He is a ninth grade student, and he happens to be the son of my office manager, Rachel Andrus. She and her husband, Ron, are here with me. He is also afflicted with Friedreich's Ataxia. Now Friedreich's Ataxia and Usher Syndrome are very rare disorders which occur in rural medically under-served Cajun populations at a rate of 2.5 times the national average. It is genetically, apparently, connected and, as a result, the Cajun population in my state have severe incidents of this particular disorder. It is rare. It is degenerative. It severely diminishes the physical abilities, and ends up confining patients to wheelchairs by their late teens. The quality of life is heavily comprised and, sadly, because of heart problems, life expectancy is shortened to 37 years. Currently, Mr. Chairman, there is no treatment and no cure. Keith stands as an example of courage, in the face of that kind of a statement: no treatment, no cures. By the way, there are many people across America who face this disorder. There is a young family in Ohio, in Struthers, Ohio. They are a very closely knit family with a mom and dad and three kids. One of the twin boys has Friedreich's Ataxia. That is in your own home state, just asan example. But across America, families like them watch their children grow up knowing that so far, there is no treatment and no cure. We are trying to do something about that. I am pleased to tell you that your subcommittee established at home in Louisiana the Center for Acadiana Genetics and Hereditary Health Care. It was established through a health care outreach grant. It is administered through the Health Resources and Services Administration. For three years, you have helped fund this center. By the way, it is heavily supported at home. Over 50 percent of its support comes from state and voluntary contributions. We are asking your support for the $1.5 million of Federal funding to keep the center open. Mr. Regula. It was $921,000 last year? Mr. Tauzin. Right, and the center, Mr. Chairman, links the School of Medicine, the Biomedical Center, the hospitals, the rural clinics, and a strong telecommunications network to provide urgently needed health services, information, and education regarding these kinds of genetic diseases. By the way, this is, of course, not the only disease that is genetically connected. Through the work of the center, in connection with other genetic research done around the country, we are learning and discovering much more about Usher Syndrome and diseases like diabetes, cancer, heart disease, Alzheimer's, Parkinson's and other psychiatric disorders. But here is this kid and his hope, literally, lies with you. Will we find a cure; will we find a treatment in time? Mr. Regula. Well, we have done a lot with genetics. Mr. Tauzin. We are doing an awful lot. The work that your committee has done is supported at NIH. We, at Energy Commerce, have jurisdiction over at NIH. I want to thank you from the bottom of my heart for the commitment that you have made to NIH. Mr. Regula. You did the authorizing in your committee. Mr. Tauzin. So we are connected here, Mr. Chairman. We will continue to be connected in this vital effort. But the bottom line is that we can not stop this kind of an effort. This kind of an effort may lead to a day when I can bring Keith here and say, guess what, we have found a cure; we have found a treatment in time for him and in time for others like him, and families like him. Mr. Regula. It seems to me that the potential lies in the genetic research that they are doing today. Mr. Tauzin. In fact, at one of the hearings, Mr. Chairman, we heard that work being done in a completely different area yielded some very exciting information that may, in fact, touch upon Friedreich's Ataxia one day. The neat thing about the work being done in all these different areas is that with the human genome completed, we are going to be able to tie some of that work together and discover how one has application on the other. My plea to you today is not for a large sum. I am not asking for half a billion dollars or hundreds of millions of dollars, just $1.5 million to keep literally hope alive for this young man and others like him. I lay it again at your feet and ask you humbly to take it seriously, and to keep this thing alive for him. Mr. Regula. Well, we have a lot of challenges on this committee, as you can fully understand. A lot of what we can do is dependent on funding. We are doing some wonderful things in research, and we hope that this will be one of them. Mr. Tauzin. Oh, I have no doubt that it is. Keith will tell you that he has no doubt. With the advances we are finding, he has no doubt that we are going to find it in time. His family has no doubt. I just want to commend him for his personal courage, and for his family's courage. Mr. Regula. Does he go to school here in Washington? Mr. Tauzin. He is here in school. Go ahead and say hello, Keith. What school do you go to? Mr. Andrus. Woodson High School Mr. Regula. Is it in D.C.? Mr. Andrus. In Virginia. Mr. Regula. In Virginia; that is Fairfax County, probably. Mr. Tauzin. Keith is already having great difficulty walking. As a result, he can not carry hot liquids or liquids, because of health reasons. Every year that Keith has come, the committee has been able to see how the disease is wrecking his frame and hurting his chances for a good healthy, long life. Mr. Regula. Keith, we will make every effort to help the NIH find a cure. Thanks for coming. Mr. Tauzin. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. Thank you all. [The information follows:] [GRAPHIC(S) NOT AVAILABLE IN TIFF FORMAT] Mr. Regula. Yes, Mr. Stupak, you are just in time. ---------- Tuesday, March 27, 2001. PROJECTS WITNESS HON. BART STUPAK, A REPRESENTATIVE IN CONGRESS FROM THE STATE OF MICHIGAN Mr. Stupak. Thank you, Mr. Chairman, Nancy; thanks for giving me the call and saying, come on over in a hurry. I was just down the hall, and I made it. [Laughter.] We have a number of requests for the committee's consideration, today, Mr. Chairman. First, let me start with Operation Uplink. This involves technological assistance to the Upper Peninsula of Michigan. What we are looking for is $2.5 million to fund an initiative to comprehensively design and advance an information-based infrastructure in the Upper Peninsula. What we are really saying is this. Northern Michigan University, Michigan Technological University, Bay de Noc Community College, Marquette General Regional Hospital, our regional libraries, economic development, and local government would like to get linked up. In doing that, we want to look at certain factors which are unique to the Upper Peninsula. If we could get a well-designed telecommunications infrastructure, we would have the opportunity to level the playing field between rural areas, like my district, and the urban areas. Mr. Regula. Would this require fiberoptics, or what type of link are you contemplating? Mr. Stupak. With the technology clusters that we are talking about, and this last mile of connections that theyare talking about, it would be better than the fiberoptics. We have some fiberoptics around Marquette and the rest of the Upper Peninsula. We are talking about high speed Internet, broad band access, things like this. In my district, even with this great economy that had been going for the last few years, the Upper Peninsula still had 5.8 percent unemployment. In Michigan Tech, where part of this is, it is around 10 to 12 unemployment. What we are saying is, in order to compete and to really get our future going, we really would like to have this UP uplink program going. If you take a look at it, Mr. Chairman, it is not much different than what we did. I have introduced legislation in the past to bring electricity, to bring telephones, to bring those services to rural America. This is one region of the country that is geographically unique. We have always had a problem with high unemployment, at 5.8 percent, while the rest of Michigan was 3.6 percent. I said some parts, in the winter months, like on the eastern end of the Upper Peninsula, unemployment is 30 percent. Now when the ice leaves the lakes, as you know, come summertime, they would have virtually no unemployment; but for four or five months out of the year, we are at 30 percent unemployment. What do you do on those cold winter nights? If we had the technology, I think there are a lot of things that we could do and can do. That is where we would like to go with that opportunity. It is $2.5 million. I would hope that you would take a look at that request. The next one is for our gerontological studies, basically for senior citizens. Again, this is at Northern Michigan University, the Upper Peninsula. Our population is about 12 percent senior citizens. On the western end, again, we just did a study in Kohebic, in Ougan Counties, and it is 25 to 30 percent of older population that is 65 and older. While we would like to use the center for research, education, community service in rural Michigan, that is related to older individuals and the aging process. It would be the knowledge of the aging process and the aging network, and its service provisions apply information as a mechanism to enhance the lives of people who reside in rural communities like Michigan's upper peninsula. This would be worked out in Northern Michigan. Again, these two programs almost go hand in hand. Thirdly, Mr. Chairman, Northwestern Michigan College, you helped them out last year. This is in Traverse City. Again, they want to operate a life-long learning center on the West Bay Campus. The senior citizen center is there. It is a waterfront area. The lifelong learning center would be the hub for participatory learning for faculty, staff, and students at Northwestern Michigan Community College in Grand Traverse County. As you know, Mr. Chairman, this is probably one of the fastest growing areas of Michigan. Retirees leave the auto plants in southern Michigan and they come up to my district to retire. Traverse City and Northwestern Michigan have been a leader in trying to provide senior programs. Again, this would go with Northwestern Michigan College in Traverse City. Last, but not least, the Olympic Scholarship is a program that we have been here a couple of times, advocating for in the last two years. You have funded it, which has helped out many athletes. Athletes train at our four Olympic Centers in Marquette, Michigan; Lake Placid, New York; Colorado Spring, Colorado; and outside San Diego, California. These athletes, most of them are young people. They are in sports such as speed skating, boxing, Greco-Roman wrestling, many of the Nordic sports. There are no scholarships for them. But they are willing to train. They take money out of their own pockets. They go all over the nation, doing training, competing. They go to Europe, where they get some help. At the same time, many of these people would also like a degree. Even if you won the gold medal in Greco-Roman wrestling, I do not know how you could make that into some kind of an economic benefit for the rest of your life, or speed skating. Even though we may win the gold medal, like some of the athletes that came out of Marquette, a couple of Olympics ago, and we may win the speed skating, there is no career in that. There is nothing. So where they are putting in all the hours, we think we should have an Olympic education training center, as Northern Michigan and these others are, and let them go to school, give them a scholarship, let them train. The boxers start at 5:00 in the morning. I have been up there talking to them many times. Many of them come from inner cities. Many of them come from poor backgrounds. They are there, and if it was not for the Olympic scholarships, not only could they not probably participate and train and work for the Olympics, but at the same time, they are getting a quality education. So the Olympic scholarships have been a great advantage to the four sites throughout this country. I hope you would fund it again. That is a quick overview. Like I said, I literally ran down here, and I think I ran through my report, too. But it is all here, and it is 15 pages. I am not going to read it. But if you have any questions on any of these three programs, that I have outlined, I would be happy to answer any questions. [The information follows:] [GRAPHIC(S) NOT AVAILABLE IN TIFF FORMAT] are there any questions? [No response.] Mr. Regula. Thank you. The Olympic Center is named after your son, I believe. Mr. Stupak. Yes, that is true, and I thank the committee for that courtesy that they have shown us. Thank you. Mr. Regula. Thank you. Next is Representative Danny Davis. ---------- Tuesday, March 27, 2001. CONSOLIDATED HEALTH CENTERS WITNESS HON. DANNY DAVIS, A REPRESENTATIVE IN CONGRESS FROM THE STATE OF ILLINOIS Mr. Davis. Thank you very much, Mr. Chairman and members of the subcommittee. I am pleased to provide the subcommittee with testimony in support of the urgent need to increase funding by $250 million for the Consolidated Health Centers Program; that is community, migrant, homeless, and public housing health centers, to at least $1.419 billion for fiscal year 2002. I realize that this committee has been very supportive of the community health center program in the past. In fact, members on both sides of the aisle of this committee have united to advance this program. It is a true testament of the integral role health centers play in the delivery of health care for this nation. I appreciate the committee's support last year of our request for a $150 million increase. Unfortunately, the $150 million increase has only enabled health centers to serve 10 percent of the Nation's 43 million uninsured people. With the uninsured population continuing to grow at a rate of over 100,000 individuals per month, it is estimated that the uninsured population will reach over 53 million by 2007. There is no question that much more needs to be done to expand health center services to reach more uninsured people, and to continue to provide quality care to existing health center patients. I applause President Bush's recent call to double the number of patients served by community health centers, enabling millions more to have access to the most basic health care. In fact, the President's budget has recommended a modest increase of $124 million for the health center program. I believe that is a good start, but because of the demand for health care and the rise in the number of uninsured, I believe we will need to raise that number to $250 million. With an additional $250 million, health centers will be able to serve and expand facilities in rural and urban communities, and see an additional 700 patients. Our nation is still divided when it comes to health care; that is, those who have and those who have not. I have had the good fortune to work directly with and in community health centers, prior to running for public office. It has been my testament and my goodwill to see that there is no other group of centers or programs in the nation that has been able to provide the kind of access to health care that these centers have given. So, Mr. Chairman, I would urge that we seriously look at increasing by $250 million, so that all of the uninsured people in this country, who would then benefit, would come out of the uninsured, to the serviced area. I thank you, Mr. Chairman. It has been a pleasure to be here. [The information follows:] [GRAPHIC(S) NOT AVAILABLE IN TIFF FORMAT] Mr. Regula. They use a lot of volunteers, am I correct, in the community health centers? Mr. Davis. Well, they used to. Volunteerism in this country is not quite what it used to be. They use volunteers. But these centers basically started out of the old OEO programs. They were put in urban and rural communities where nothing hardly was there. Many of them have become the centerpieces for economic development in those communities, as well, and they are the biggest thing there. They provide not only health care, but they have provided employment opportunities, business and economic development opportunities, and they are pretty much considered to be community-owned. People feel really good about them. Mr. Regula. I am sure that is true. We have one in our area. Are there any questions? [No response.] Mr. Davis. Thank you very much, Mr. Chairman and members of the committee. Mr. Regula. Thank you. Next is my colleague from Ohio, Mr. Kucinich. ---------- Tuesday, March 27, 2001. UNITED STATES HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES WITNESS HON. DENNIS KUCINICH, A REPRESENTATIVE IN CONGRESS FROM THE STATE OF OHIO Mr. Kucinich. Good afternoon, Mr. Chairman. Mr. Regula. Dennis, we are happy to welcome you. Mr. Kucinich. It is my pleasure to be in front of your subcommittee. I appreciate it very much. Good afternoon to my colleagues; I appreciate the chance to be in front in your committee. With the permission of the Chair, I will begin whenever it is appropriate. Mr. Regula. Go ahead. Mr. Kucinich. Thank you very much for the opportunity to appear before the committee. I am urging the committee to prevent the use of Federal funds for prolonging the public comment period of the final Medical Privacy Standards. Last month, a new 30-day comment period was opened on the standards mandated by the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act, and several industries are lobbying to extend the period even further. These regulations are long overdue. When Congress passed HIPAA in 1996 with strong bipartisan support, it required HHS to promulgate rules by August 23rd, 1999, if Congress did not legislate. During HHS' work on the regulations, Congress and other interested parties articulated their views. In September, 1997, the Secretary of HHS submitted a health privacy report to Congress and testified before the Senate Committee on Labor and Human Resources. Several bills were introduced. The proposed rule was published in November, 1999. Industry and consumer groups asked for the comment period to be extended, and HHS pushed the deadline back by 45 days. The rule generated extraordinary feedback; 52,000 comments. Clearly, the health care and insurance industries have had ample opportunity to make their voices heard, and have done so. Now the industry groups seeks to weaken the medical privacy law by delaying the rule's implementation. The rule already allows health plans two years to comply, and gives small plans an additional year beyond that deadline. These groups do not have a leg to stand on in lobbying for continued delay. They have had plenty of input into the regulations, have known for five years that the regulation was forthcoming, and now have another two to three years to meet the deadline. By not implementing the rule, not only are the medical privacy of patients put at risk, but so is the privacy of their Social Security numbers, the privacy of their financial information, their ability to maintain health coverage, and even keep a job. That is really the core of this. Here are some examples of abuses that have occurred because of the lack of medical privacy laws. Last December, Terry Sergeant, a North Carolina resident, was fired from her job, after being diagnosed with an expensive genetic disorder. Three weeks before being fired, she was given a positive review at work and a raise. She suspects her self-insured employer found out about her condition and fired her to avoid the medical expense. A truck driver in Atlanta was fired from his job after his employer learned that he had previously sought treatment for a drinking problem. A California woman requested that her pharmacy not disclose her prescription information to her husband, from whom she had separated. When he contacted the pharmacy, he received a copy of all of her prescription records, and then gave them to the rest of the family, her friends, the Department of Motor Vehicles and others, claiming she was a drug addict and a danger to her children. A banker who served on his county's health board cross- referenced his customer accounts with patient information, and then called the mortgages of anyone with cancer. The University of Michigan Medical Center inadvertently put several thousand patient records on public Internet sites for two months in 1999. Only when a student searching for information about a doctor found links to private patient records with numbers, job status, medical treatments and other information was the problem discovered. It goes on and on and on, Mr. Chairman. I will submit, with the Chair's permission, all of this testimony. But what it comes down to is that the implementation of the Medical Privacy Rules on April 14th ought to be strongly considered. Americans long ago asked Congress to respond to the threat of vulnerable privacy records, and many have already suffered from abuse of private information made public. This committee can ensure that these protections go into effect if you prohibit the use of funds in this bill to delay the implementation of the medical privacy regulations any longer. I am here presenting this in my capacity as the Chair of the Progressive Caucus. I thank the Chair for his indulgence and I thank the members. Thank you. [The information follows:] [GRAPHIC(S) NOT AVAILABLE IN questions? [No response.] Mr. Regula. Thank you. Mr. Kucinich. Thank you and good afternoon. Mr. Regula. Do we have any other members here? Don Young is the next one on the list. Mr. Kucinich. Mr. Chairman, in concluding, I am just going to submit all of this record, if the Chair would accept it. Mr. Regula. Oh, yes, all statements are part of the record. Ms. Pelosi. Would the Chair yield? Mr. Regula. Yes, certainly. Ms. Pelosi. Mr. Chairman, I do not know whether you saw it last night, but on TV on PBS, they had a special presentation. What it consisted of, largely, is something of interest to the committee. It was about environmental health. What it was, it was the release of documents from the chemical industry, as to what they knew and when they knew it, about danger to workers in the work place, and communities surrounding these factories. Last year, as I have mentioned a couple of times in our hearings, under Chairman Porter's leadership, we had a hearing on environmental health. Scientists came and talked about the need for bio-monitoring to monitor what people are breathing and drinking in the water, from chemicals in the environment. It was a very important hearing. In fact, I have been on the committee, and others who have been on it longer, do not recall us ever having a hearing on a single subject. Usually, we have hearings of this kind. So that hearing, plus the funding and the generosity of this committee to fund the CDC over the last four years to increase the funding of the environmental health project, have taken us a long way down the road to having an understanding of the connection between health or disease and chemicals in the atmosphere or in the water. I would commend Moyer's show to the Chairman's attention, and to all of our colleague's attention. Certainly, we want to have a balanced approach as to how we go forward. We do not want to do anything that is not science-based. But certainly, on behalf of our children's health, we really do not know what risk we are putting children at. Of course, because they are younger and developing, they are impacted more directly and more negatively than older people. Mr. Regula. Well, it seems to me, we have had an EPA for many years, and we have all these agencies. Would they not have a vast body of knowledge about these types of hazards? Ms. Pelosi. You would think so. In the testing that is done, you know, they will test the air, they will test the water, and they will test this or that. But this is the work that we are doing now to see what to monitor in human beings. Because of the generosity of this committee over the past few years, the CDC is in a much better position to do some of the monitoring, which I think you have heard in one of the points that Mr. Stokes made, when he was here, on the environmental health issue that he is working and that monitoring. Then we see that children have higher incidences of asthma, because of the atmosphere in which they live and that the connection between the environment and health is a direct one. The committee has taken the lead on this. I think it would be interesting to see some more evidence on that. Mr. Regula. What conclusions did Moyer reach, or what recommendations, if any? Ms. Pelosi. Well, the whole point was that we have to have data. We have to have a ground truth on the basis of which we go forward. Even the chemical industry admitted in their own statements that we really do not know what some of the risks are to these. Even though they have set out to make some tests, they have not done them, yet. Again, this is information that would be useful to the committee. The committee has to have a scientific basis and data on which to make judgments. This is another piece of information that I think would be useful to the committee, as it balances its decisions. Mr. Regula. Where did you see this? Ms. Pelosi. It was on PBS, and it was called ``Trade Secrets.'' Basically, what it was, a lot of the chemical industries, over the past 40 years, have known the danger that their chemicals have posed to the public, but have kept that information from the public. Indeed, in their own documentation, they show how, when they were going to go to NOISH, which is the science part. OSHA is the work place safety and NOISH is the scientific research part of it. They said, well we cannot deny if they ask us, but we will not volunteer the information, even though NOISH had put out a call for all information regarding some of these chemicals in the atmosphere. So it is interesting. Mr. Peterson [assuming chair]. I think the situation with liability that we have, I know ladder companies, and this is on the whole safety side, were hesitant to improve the ladder, because they admit then that the ladder was not as strong and safe as it could have been with the new improvements, and they were instantly liable, if anybody got hurt on the old ladder, so they never put the new structure out or changed it. I have a feeling that companies, as they improve their processes, realize that they have come up with a new process that is better than how they were doing it, but instantly are liable to the trial lawyers for cases, because they have now improved the process. They have found out how to reduce it. I mean, I really think this thing cuts both ways. Ms. Pelosi. I say we have to balance that. You bring up an interesting point. When I say this was a trade secret, all of this was largely a presentation of their own documents, of the documents of the chemical industry that are now public. One of the things that does not relate to workman's comp or anything like that is, for example, hair spray, and what is involved in aerosol hair spray. If you have it in the work place, you have some protection in liability, because of workman's comp and this or that. But once that is proven to be a danger to the general public, then it is a different dynamic, if you were to be sued or something like that. So they have, in this case, even more reason to keep the information secret, not because of what it meant in terms of work place, but what it meant in terms of the general public. I see that one of our colleagues has arrived. Again, this would be a good committee, because we have the CDC. We have the NIH. We have the science at NOISH. We have the scientific institutions, as part of our dynamics. We do not want to proceed on a notion or emotion. We want to proceed on the basis of science. This is a very valuable contribution, in terms of avoiding the science. We have a different responsibility, I think. But we do have responsibility for balance, and I look forward to working with you on that. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. Mr. Regula [resuming chair]. Thank you, Nancy. We have a health care task force group. The first speaker in that group will be our friend from Ohio, again, Mr. Kucinich, and I believe Ms. Christenson is here, also. Ms. Pelosi. Mr. Chairman, I am sorry, I did realize Mr. Kucinich was coming forward again, or I would not have continued. Mr. Regula. No, that is all right. I think it is a real problem. Ms. Pelosi. For everything that I have said, it is more so in minority communities and disadvantaged communities, because that is where a lot of these chemicals are. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. Mr. Regula. Thank you. Representative Kucinich. ---------- Tuesday, March 27, 2001. HEALTH CARE INSURANCE PORTABILITY AND ACCOUNTABILITY ACT (HIPAA) WITNESS HON. DENNIS KUCINICH, CHAIR, CONGRESSIONAL PROGRESSIVE CAUCUS HEALTH CARE TASK FORCE Mr. Kucinich. Mr. Chairman, it is a pleasure to be a part of your committee once again. I thank you very much for the chance to appear, and to Ms. Pelosi. I saw that two hour program. We will have a chance to chat about it soon; thank you. I am here on behalf of the Congressional Progressive Caucus, of which I am the Chair, and to address some issues that I know this committee is very concerned about. America is home to the most advanced medical research facilities and scientists in the world. In part, that is because this committee has provided funding and guidance to achieve it. I am pleased that so many of my colleagues have supported doubling the budget at the National Institute of Health. I think we all appreciate the priority of finding therapies and cures for diseases and other ailments to improve public health; but America is home to irony, as well. For example, the United States ranks 25th among other nations in infant mortality rates, which is twice the rate of Singapore, which has the lowest rate. These statistics reflect the gross failure of our health system to provide access to adequate prenatal care. Every day, 410 babies are born to mothers who receive late or no prenatal care, according to the National Center for Health Statistics. African American infants are more than twice as likely as white infants to die before their first birthday. Among others, the United States ranks 20th in maternal mortality levels. According to the World Health Organization, half of these could be prevented through early diagnosis and appropriate medical care of pregnancy complications. For a country with advanced medical technology, it is unfortunate that mothers and infants do not have access to basic preventive health care. This example illustrates the broader point that this committee must also fund programs to get cures that we pay for to the people who need them, prevent disease, and ensure a minimum level of health care to every American. The AIDS crisis in our country requires a comprehensive strategy, meaning prevention therapy and research for a cure. Up to 900,000 Americans are now infected with HIV, and half of this population is under the age of 25. This committee, I hope, will be able to fund the following programs at the Centers for Disease Control to prevent infection and provide care for those who are infected: prevention activities that depend on CDC funds given to local health departments; HIV Prevention Community Planning Groups, and the Substance Abuse Prevention and Treatment Block Grant. The minority HIV/AIDS Initiative works on both prevention and providing care resources in communities of color, where the major of new AIDS cases occur. In order to provide care for those infected with HIV, the Ryan White CARE Act and the Housing Opportunities for People with AIDS Program support a range of services. This coordinated group of programs is crucial to dealing with the HIV virus, and all should be fully funded. The Progressive Caucus is also asking that the committee raise its funding level of support to programs under the Health Resources and Services Division that are critical to maintain a skilled health work force. They have a number of other recommendations here, which I would ask the Chair and the committee to please give their thoughtful consideration to. As any of the health programs we are talking about, the solution needs to be comprehensive. Besides research and development of therapies, we must train doctors and nurses in new therapies, for us to have medical professionals serve in shortage areas of the country. This strategy must also include educating people about how to take care of their own health, and exercise preventive strategies. Prevention is the best medicine. Mr. Chairman, the committee has been a leader in providing for health advances in our country. I ask it to continue to be a leader by funding initiatives to make health advances accessible to all Americans. I thank the Chair, and thanks to all the members for your time. [The information follows:] [GRAPHIC(S) NOT AVAILABLE IN TIFF FORMAT] Mr. Regula. Thank you. Representative Christensen. ---------- Tuesday, March 27, 2001. CONGRESSIONAL BLACK CAUCUS HEALTH CARE TASK FORCE WITNESS HON. DONNA M. CHRISTIAN-CHRISTENSEN, A DELEGATE FROM THE U.S. VIRGIN ISLANDS, CHAIR, CONGRESSIONAL BLACK HEALTH CARE TASK FORCE Ms. Christensen. Thank you. Good afternoon, Mr. Chairman and members of the subcommittee. It is a pleasure to be here. Mr. Chairman, I want to begin by congratulating you on your assumption of the Chair of this new subcommittee. As Chair of the Interior Subcommittees for several years, my constituents have been the beneficiary of your leadership. Of course, the territories are a part of the health dilemma that we are going to discuss this afternoon. It is one which is defined by grave disparities in health care status. The subcommittee has my full testimony. I am going to summarize and also clarify a few points in it, if I might. First, the funding, including my request in the CBC and HIV and AIDS minority initiative, is not intended just for African Americans, but for all communities of color. It also extends to people living in our rural areas. Second, the request is additional to and not intended to supplant or take away from any other Department of Health and Human Services funding. Indeed, we are requesting that the department's budget be fully funded, at least at the 2001 level. Third, the request, which includes our HIV and AIDS initiative, is for $1 billion for fiscal year 2002, and hopefully for subsequent years through 2006. Fourth, while they do not come under the jurisdiction of this subcommittee, we have included in our overall agenda, universal coverage in the full lifting in the cap on Medicaid for the territories. We hope for your support, as well as the support of other subcommittee members on this initiative. My testimony here today, however, is on the state of African American health in this country, and what I think it will take to adequately address it. In any discussion on the health of people of African descent in the United States, it is important that it be framed in the context of what is called the Slave Health Deficit; 400 years of health care, deferred or denied, a deficit that has never been made up. Even at the dawn of this new century and millennium, African Americans have the lowest life expectancy of any other population group in this country, and the gap has widened, actually, since 1985. Today, hundreds of African Americans will die from preventable diseases. This number is increased over the last 20 years. Deaths from heart disease are 38 percent higher in black males and 68 percent higher in black females. In recent years, our death rate due to stroke was about 75 percent higher than in our white counterparts. The prevalence of diabetes in African Americans is almost 70 percent higher than in whites; and with less access to care, African Americans suffer more amputations, blindness and kidney failure. The infant mortality gap has widened since 1985, and ours is twice that of our white counterparts. Over 50 percent of all new HIV infections annually are in African Americans, and we make up 45 percent of all AIDS cases, and we are only about 13 percent of the total population. An African American male is almost eight times as likely to have AIDS as his white counterpart, and for women, that is about twenty times more likely. Mr. Chairman, our health agenda in the request to the subcommittee makes an attempt to address the causes of disparities. The facts that I have just recited just barely scratch the surface. Twenty-three percent of African Americans are uninsured. Many have Medicaid; but recent studies have called into question the quality of care, and in particular, for HIV/AIDS, that Medicaid recipients have received. Much current research has demonstrated that even with insurance, and when other factors are equal, African Americans and particularly women experience clear discrimination in their receipt of health care services. On the other hands, when language, ethnicity, and culture are the same or similar, research shows better rapport and, therefore, better compliance and outcomes. Mental health services are severely lacking for American Americans at all ages. Put simply, according to our Surgeon General, Dr. David Satcher, the U.S. mental health system is not well equipped to meet the needs of racial and ethnic minority populations. All of these and other factors conspire to create the disparities that exist for African Americans, as well as other people of color. They form the basis for our request. As discussed briefly in the full testimony, they are: allotting full funding for the new Center for Minority and Disparity Health Research at NIH, as well as having the other offices of minority health in the agencies funded. The $1 billion request would provide the following: increase health providers of color; provide adequate staff for our medically under-served areas; enhance the ability of our providers to practice their art and to provide for ethnics and diversity training in our health profession schools, and collect important health data. These are provisions of the Minority and Disparity Education Act of 2000. It would increase and provide culturally and linguistically sensitive mental health services in communities of color; adequately fund the community health centers, which are the nexus of health care for our communities; provide adequate health services for inmates in correctional facilities; provide adequate outreach and funding for immunization programs; continue and expandthe CDC minority AIDS initiative. Mr. Chairman, in 1998, the Congressional Black Caucus, joined by community organizations and health advocates from around the country, called on Secretary Donna Shalala to declare a state of emergency for HIV and AIDS in the African American community and other communities of color. What we achieved was a declaration of a severe and ongoing crisis; and to have, first $156 million in 1999; $249 million in 2000; and this year, $350 million targeted to communities of color. This initiative, which needs to be expanded, has been effective, and it has been affected across all communities of color. However, we made one mistake; we should have called for a state of emergency in the overall health of African Americans and other people of color. It is this emergency, that for the health of African Americans and for people of color, across all of the diseases, which is the emergency that truly exists. With the full funding of the request before you today, which this country today has the resources to do, we can begin to respond appropriately to the crisis that exists in health care for our communities today. Under your leadership, this country can make the moral and political commitment to guarantee access to medical care as a fundamental right to all of its people. I thank you, Mr. Chairman and subcommittee members, for the opportunity to testify. I will be happy to answer any questions. [The information follows:] [GRAPHIC(S) NOT AVAILABLE IN TIFF FORMAT] Ms. Pelosi. I just have a brief question. Mr. Regula. Yes, go ahead. Ms. Pelosi. I was so impressed by the very important testimony that our colleague has presented. It stands on its own, and her credentials are well known to us. But I would like her to put on the record her credentials as a health professional, and all that she brings to this testimony today, Mr. Chairman. We are so proud of her. Ms. Christensen. I should have said that I chair the Health Braintrust of the Congressional Black Caucus. I am a family physician, and have been in practice for 21 years in the Virgin Islands, also. I was a public health official in the Virgin Islands for many of those years. Mr. Regula. Well, that is a vanishing group, the family physicians. Ms. Christensen. Yes, and that is the pearl of American health. Mr. Regula. I agree with you. I felt strongly that we should encourage more family physicians. You cannot just take one area of a human being, and not be sensitive to the whole person. Ms. Christensen. I suspect that it will come back. Mr. Regula. Probably economics are driving it, as much as anything. With the high costs that students have, they feel like the specialties pay better. Ms. Christensen. Well, they do. That is another area that has to be addressed, in terms of the reimbursement. I know that HCFA is going to be under much scrutiny this year. Hopefully, some of those issues will be addressed. Mr. Regula. Well, it is great what you did. Were you in a smaller community? Ms. Christensen. I practiced in the Virgin Islands. I was always able to make house calls, for most of practice. The island that I practice on has between 50,000 and 60,000 people. Mr. Regula. There are others besides you there, I hope? Ms. Christensen. Yes. [Laughter.] Mr. Regula. That would keep you busy. Well, thank you for bringing this to our attention. Ms. Christensen. You are welcome. Thank you, again, for the opportunity to testify. Mr. Regula. Next, we have our friend from Alaska. ---------- Tuesday, March 27, 2001. CLOSE UP FOUNDATION WITNESS HON. DON YOUNG, A REPRESENTATIVE IN CONGRESS FROM THE STATE OF ALASKA Mr. Young. I have a very short statement that I will read in its entirety, primarily because the staffer wrote it, and this is the first time she ever wrote anything for me. Mr. Regula. I thought you were going to say that it was the first time you ever asked for any. Mr. Young. No, not really. [Laughter.] I will say, Mr. Chairman and members of the committee, I would suggest, as we have new members on this committee that have not been involved in the Close Up Program, and that is what I am here today to talk about. The Ellender Fellowship Program is a critical component in Close Up's educational program to educate our Nation's young people about how our Federal system of Government works, and their rights and responsibilities as citizens. Congress created the Allen J. Ellender Program in 1972, out of a belief that our Nation was at a critical juncture in ensuring that the next generation of Americans would share in the values and beliefs of the preceding generations, who forged our democratic form of government. By the way, Mr. Chairman and members of the committee, 1972 was the first year that I ran for this job. I believe that we must ensure the present generation of young Americans is committed to the ideals of active citizenship, service to the community, and loyalty to country, that are the foundation of our democratic system of government. We must be dedicated to educating young people about civic virtue and teaching them about their place in our democracy. Our national heritage includes an unwavering belief in the importance of each and every citizen to the success and health of our democracy. The Close Up Foundation has embraced this belief and made it an integral part of its mission to educate young people. Close Up is dedicated to the principle that the poorest among our Nation's young people should have an opportunity to come to Washington to gain first-hand experience in how our Government works. The Close Up Foundation utilizes the Ellender Fellowship Program to reach out to student populations that are among the most economically needy and under-served. The Ellender Fellowship recipients include students from our Native American, immigrant, rural and inner city communities. As the State of Alaska's sole representative in the House, I have had the privilege to meet with numerous students from Alaska, visiting Washington as part of the Close Up's civic education program. Mr. Chairman and members of the committee, we have had 11,000, since the beginning of this program, from Alaska, that have come to participate in this good program. For students in rural Alaska, Washington, D.C. is far removed from their everyday lives, and is a place that operates in a way that they may not fully understand. Many of these students do not have access to C-Span, so they have never seen Congress in action. Close Up recognizes that their geographic isolation does not mean they play less of a role in the future of our country. I believe that we should be highly supportive of programs that successfully aid young people in becoming well-rounded, informed, and active citizens. The Allen J. Ellender Fellowship Program provides teachers and economically disadvantaged students with a unique opportunity to travel to Washington, and learn first-hand about Government. A health democracy depends upon the participation of its citizens. This critical education program deserves our full attention and our full support. In closing, I would ask the subcommittee to recognize the critically needed work of the Close Up Foundation through continued and increased funding of the Allen J. Ellender Fellowship Program. I want to thank you, Mr. Chairman and members of the subcommittee. As I said, this is a short statement. I wouldbe willing to answer any questions. Again, I want to stress, there are 11,000 Alaskan students who have participated in this program. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. [The information follows:] [GRAPHIC(S) NOT AVAILABLE IN TIFF FORMAT] Mr. Regula. Are there any questions? The Ellender Fellowship or Foundation provides money for students to participate, who otherwise would not be able to? Mr. Young. That is the primary purpose of this program, to have those people in from the rural areas and impoverished area; and believe me, we still have them in Alaska, to come to Washington, D.C. We do have other schools that do participate in this in here, from a more influential group of people. However, we are a long ways away, and it has been very good for the State of Alaska. Mr. Regula. Is Ellender just confined to Alaska? Mr. Young. No, it is nationwide; it is huge. Alaska has participated in it. I have helped raise money in the private sector for this program. Mr. Regula. Well, you have had 11,000 over what period of time? Mr. Young. Since 1972. Mr. Regula. Given your population base, that is still a lot. Mr. Young. Yes, that is a lot of them; and if we had the same population, same ratio, it would be over 250,000 in California. We really do participate in this program. Mr. Regula. Yes, they do. Well, thank you for coming today. Mr. Young. I am pleased to see that my two new members did not ask me any questions. I was not sure that I could answer them. But thank you, Mr. Chairman, and congratulations to you. Mr. Porter sat in that chair for many years, and I know you will do a wonderful job. Mr. Regula. He did a great job when he was here. Mr. Young. And you will do equally as well. Thank you very much. Next is Mr. Fattah from Pennsylvania. ---------- Tuesday, March 27, 2001. CONGRESSIONAL BLACK CAUCUS EDUCATIONAL BRAIN TRUST WITNESSES HON. CHAKA FATTAH, A REPRESENTATIVE IN CONGRESS FROM THE COMMONWEALTH OF PENNSYLVANIA, ON BEHALF OF REP. MAJOR OWEN, A REPRESENTATIVE IN CONGRESS FROM THE STATE OF NEW YORK, CHAIR, CONGRESSIONAL BLACK CAUCUS EDUCATIONAL BRAIN TRUST HON. RUBEN E. HINOJOSA, A REPRESENTATIVE IN CONGRESS FROM THE STATE OF TEXAS, CONGRESSIONAL HISPANIC CAUCUS Mr. Fattah. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. If you do not mind, I have asked my good friend, Congressman Hinojosa, to join me, because we share a similar interest, and we could expedite the committee's work. Mr. Regula. That is fine. Mr. Fattah. Let me thank you for allowing me to pitch hit for Congressman Major Owens, who was scheduled to provide this testimony, and is unable to do so. I am going to let my written testimony stand for the record. I would like to thank the Chairman, because of his tremendous interest in a variety of matters, relative to education. I am not going to belabor any of the points that need to be made. I would also like to welcome my two colleagues from Pennsylvania, Congressman Peterson and Sherwood, who have served with me before in the State Senate, and worked on education-related matters. We have a lot of mutual interests. Let me say on behalf of the Congressional Black Caucus, the Caucus has laid out a number of positions, which are articulated in the written testimony about the need for this committee's continued support. This committee really has been in the vanguard of pushing for a set of programs and initiatives that have helped hundreds of thousands of young people live up to their potential, pursue an adequate education, and to go on to higher education. There is an emphasis, obviously, on the Pell Grant and the Trio Programs and, most particularly, the Gear Up Program, which is close to my heart. I want to thank the committee for its support over the last three cycles for its support for Gear Up, which I authored and moved through the House, with a lot of help from a lot of different people. It is now helping over one million young people in our country. Mr. Regula. You introduced me to it, when we were down at St. Petersburg. Mr. Fattah. That is right, and it is a tremendous program. It is doing very, very well. But I know that this subcommittee will have an allocation, and you have some very difficult decisions to make. I respect whatever deliberations and outcomes there will be from the result of that. There are a lot of choices from Head Start on through in the education pipeline, to help move young people and their families. However, in terms of the Congressional Black Caucus and the Hispanic Caucus, we represent constituencies that these programs impact most acutely, and they are very important, too. So we just want to urge you to do all that you can do. I would also say that I am very concerned, and I will betestifying before the House Education Committee tomorrow, about the whole question of how to encourage states to do more themselves to give disadvantaged and poor communities, both in urban and rural areas, an equal educational opportunity. Part of the problem is that the Federal Government is trying to help make up the deficit that is the result of a lack of full support from our state governments in the poor communities in those states. We need to work more as a Congress to try to encourage states to treat both our rural school districts and urban school districts in a way in which young people will get a fair and an equal opportunity. I know that we cannot legislate outcomes, but I think that we could do more to encourage states not to have poor children, who are already disadvantaged, made more disadvantaged by the way that they create their funding cycles and dispense curriculums around the state. Nancy Pelosi, in the great State of California, knows that there is a major litigation going on there in which young people in Compton High have little or no opportunity to take AP courses; and young people at Berkeley High have more than 25 AP courses to choose from. It just creates a circumstance in which not every young person can pursue, within their own potential, what God-given talents they have. So I just think, Mr. Chairman, that your committee will make a lot of tough decisions about allocations and programmatic thrusts. We can also do more by encouraging these states to take their children, and to give not just the wealthy, middle class suburban youngsters every opportunity, but to also make sure that those who are impoverished, who live in rural and urban communities in their states, to have the same opportunity to have quality teachers in the classroom, good facilities, and an adequate curriculum to prepare them. So thank you, Mr. Chairman. [The information follows:] [GRAPHIC(S) NOT AVAILABLE IN TIFF FORMAT] Mr. Regula. I think it is a universal thing. Ohio is going through the same type of lawsuit, involving Appalachia. Mr. Fattah. Yes. Mr. Regula. Mr. Hinojosa. Mr. Hinojosa. Thank you very much, Mr. Chairman. On behalf of the Congressional Hispanic Caucus, CHC, I want to thank you and the members of the Appropriations Committee for allowing Chaka and me to come before you and discuss the educational needs of the African American children, Hispanic children, and all minority children in the United States. I want to preface my remarks by saying that I have only served four years in Congress. As I start my fifth year, I want to say that it has been a real pleasure for me to collaborate with Chaka Fattah. Both of us serve on the Education Committee, and we are well informed and certainly committed to work on trying to help children graduate from high school and go on to higher education. It is no doubt that two caucuses, the Black Caucus and Hispanic Caucus, working together, are beginning to really make a difference in bringing to the forefront the importance of educating children early: Early Start, Head Start, Gear Up, K- 12 programs that are exemplary in helping students graduate from high school, and then of course bringing a great deal of attention to the work that is being done by HSIs and HBCUs. All of this is to say that some of the senior members of committees that I serve on in Education have commented that never before have they seen the collaborative work being done by the Black Caucus and the Hispanic Caucuses. So I thank you for this opportunity. As you know, the Census Bureau projects that by the year 2030, Hispanic children will represent 25 percent of the total student population. Census figures already indicate that Hispanics have become the Nation's largest minority. In my area, the largest county that I represent, Hidalgo County, has grown to 88 percent in population. Mr. Regula. Where is that located in Texas? Mr. Hinojosa. It is south of San Antonio, 250 miles. Hidalgo County is on the Texas border region, between Brownsville and Laredo, an area that is the third fastest MSA in the country. It is an area that in my own district, it has grown by 50 percent over the last 10 years. Mr. Regula. That would be southwest then; am I correct? Mr. Hinojosa. We are considered the Southwest. Texas is so spread out that I am 850 miles from west Texas and El Paso. I am 650 miles from Dallas. It is an area that is just growing by leaps and bounds. Mr. Regula. Where do you fly to go home? Mr. Hinojosa. I fly Houston, and then Houston to McAllen. It takes me seven hours. Mr. Regula. But you are not on the Gulf of Mexico, though? Mr. Hinojosa. No, I am approximately an hour. Solomon Ortiz represents the coastal area from Brownsville to Corpus Christie; and I run parallel with him, from McAllen to San Antonio; Rodriguez is parallel with mine, from Rio Grande City to San Antonio. Then the fourth one would be Henry Bonilla from Laredo to San Antonio. All that area has grown so much that we are going to get two new Congressional Districts in that area. Mr. Fattah. They are taking those from Pennsylvania, right? [Laughter.] Mr. Regula. They are both going to be Republican; is that right? Mr. Fattah. We will see. NOT AVAILABLE IN TIFF FORMAT] Are any questions from the members? [No response.] Mr. Hinojosa. I want to say that the amounts that are in my prepared material have some very specific numbers that we are asking, as the Congressional Hispanic Caucus, on the Appropriation funding that we are asking. For example, on Title 1, we are asking for a level of funding of $24 billion. If you ask why it is that much, the reason is that we are not serving all of the eligible children. So what we did is, we took the number that are eligible and multiplied it, because it is a formula-funded program, and it would take $24 billion to serve all those that are qualified and eligible. The Caucus also is suggesting a funding level of $508 million for Title 7 of the ESEA. Another figure that is very important to us is the request for $500 million for adult continuation programs. Mr. Regula. That is a pretty hefty increase that you are proposing. Mr. Hinojosa. We are, simply because this is the time that President Bush is saying that education is the foremost important issue. If we are going to do what he says, and not leave any child behind, then it is going to take getting up to the funding level that will reach all the children, and not just a few. If you look at some of the programs, such as Gear Up, and you will see that we are asking for an amount that will take us into the next funding level, so that they would be getting, what is that number, Chaka? Mr. Fattah. $495 million. Mr. Hinojosa. Yes, $495 million. Mr. Fattah. Right. Mr. Hinojosa. Again, I am not trying to exaggerate when I say that when you are only serving 38 percent of the children who are eligible in head start; when we are serving only a small number who qualify for Gear Up; when you take a look at the under-funding that has occurred in the last 10 years for HSIs, Hispanic Serving Institutions, where we were getting only $10 million in help, and we took that number from $10 million to $28 million, just think about this. There are 203 Hispanic Serving Institutions, and over three million Hispanic college students. So this is just to say that we have neglected many of these exemplary programs. All we are asking is that you take a good look at these programs, because they are the ones who are going to help our students graduate from high school, go on to colleges, and become professions. In fact, some of them may become Congressmen. Mr. Fattah. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. Mr. Regula. I think Henry Bonilla went through the Trio Program. Mr. Fattah. Yes. Mr. Regula. Is the state pulling its share? Mr. Hinojosa. We are challenging them, I guarantee you. We are challenging the State of Texas to do their share. Mr. Regula. Are there any questions? Mr. Sherwood. Mr. Sherwood. I would just like to suggest to the gentleman from Texas that he take good care of those two Congressional seats, because we might want them back some day. [Laughter.] Ms. Pelosi. Mr. Chairman, I would like to commend these two gentlemen. They have worked so hard on the education issues on their committee and with Mr. Fattah here on the Appropriations Committee. Mr. Hinjosa will do a lot for the economic development of his area on the Banking Committee, which has some important jurisdiction, down there for economic development. But when they talk about Gear Up, the work on the authorizing side is so important to us here, both for the Hispanic servicing institutions and the Historical Black colleges and universities, that have been such a tremendous resource to us. So for all of the K-12 preschool and the rest and higher education, thank you for making it, I do not want to say easier, but for helping our community give this such a high priority. I am pleased to work with you in these areas. Mr. Fattah. Thank you, Mr. Chairman, for giving us the time, and we look forward to working with you. I am sorry that I am off the House Education Committee. However, I am happy to be on the Appropriations Committee. Mr. Regula. I believe you made a worthwhile change. Next is Mr. Underwood from Guam. I used to see you in the Interior. ---------- Tuesday, March 27, 2001. CONGRESSIONAL ASIAN PACIFIC AMERICAN CAUCUS HEALTH CARE TASK FORCE WITNESS HON. BOB UNDERWOOD, A UNITED STATES DELEGATE FROM GUAM AND CHAIR, CONGRESSIONAL ASIAN PACIFIC AMERICAN CAUCUS HEALTH CARE TASK FORCE Mr. Underwood. Mr. Chairman, it is always a pleasure to appear in front of you, begging for more money in various capacities. Mr. Regula. And you are pretty good at it. [Laughter.] Mr. Underwood. Well, thank you, Mr. Chairman and members of the committee, for the opportunity to present the concerns of the Asian and Pacific Island Caucus on some major health issues concerns. You may already know, Mr. Chairman, that the Asian and Pacific Island is the most diverse ethical and racial group in the country, comprised of both immigrant populations and indigenous populations of Pacific Islanders. It also is the most heterogenous community. What you may not know is that Asian and Pacific Islander communities are severely hampered by a lack of accurate demographic data to monitor and enforce civil rights, laws, and ensure equal access to Federal programs, and in particular, health care. This lack of meaningful data makes it difficult to track health treads, identify problems areas and solutions, and enforce civil rights. This problem has been attempted to be resolved by the Office of Management and Budget back in 1997, when it made a significant change to the standards for maintaining, collecting and presenting Federal data on race and ethnicity. This chain separated Asians from Native Hawaiians and other Pacific Islanders, and allowed respondents to designate more than one racial ethnic category. We hope that this effort will provide more accurate data. In addition, to this particular issue, the 1990 Census also reported that about 35 percent of Asian and Pacific Islanders live in linguistically-isolated household, in which none of the individuals ages 14 or over spoke any English very well. In 1997, the Census reported the rate of persons with limited English proficiency grew to 40 percent for Asian and Pacific Islanders Americans, and over 60 percent for Southeast Asian Americans. The absence or severe lack of culturally and linguistically-assessable services leads to the gross under- utilization of health care services, misdiagnosis and treatment of disease, chronic illness and needless suffering. It also contributes to Asian and Pacific Islanders seeking treatment at a much later more progressed state of illness, which is not only costlier to treat, but is often preventable with earlier detection. Asian and Pacific Islanders are often mislabeled as the model minority with few health is social problems. This label is a myth and a gross myth representation of the community, which is very diverse. Within this population alone, there exits divergent social economic achievement rates, among euthenics and racial diverse cultures. Recent data from various institutions and Government agencies, including the Department of Heath and Human Services and the Census, revealed for example the following disparities. Compared to the total U.S. population, disproportionate numbers of minority Americans lack health insurance; about 24 percent of Asian and Pacific Islanders Americans. Asian and Pacific Islander Americans continue to experience the highest rate of tuberculosis and hepatitis B in this country. Approximately one half of all woman who give birth to Hepatitis B carrier infants in the U.S. were foreign-born Asian woman. Liver cancer, which is usually caused by exposure to Hepatitis B virus, disproportionately effects the Asian Americans. Filipinos have the second poorest five year survival rates for colon and rectal cancers of all U.S. ethnic groups. Cancer is reported as the leading cause of death in nearly all Pacific Island jurisdiction. In Guam, lung cancer accounts for one-third of all recorded deaths. Native Hawaiians have the second highest mortality rate in the National due to lung cancer. Cervical cancer is a significant problem in Korean and American women, and it affects Vietnamese American women at a rate five times higher than white women. Breast cancer incidents in Japanese American women is approaching that of white women. Moreover, some studies indicate that approximately 79 percent of Asian-born Asian American women have a greater proportion of tumors larger than one centimeter at diagnosis. Breast and cervical cancer rates for Marshallese Islander are five times and 75 times higher respectably for rates for all U.S. women. Native Hawaiian woman have the highest incidents of mortality rates of endometrial cancers of all U.S. woman. Diabetes affects tomorrow's indigenous people of Guam and Commonwealth of the northern Marianas Islands at five times the National average. Infant mortality rates in the U.S. insular areas of American Samoa, Guam and Siena more than double the National average. Finally, in my home island of Guam, there has been a recent and significant incidence of suicide, and particularly teen suicides, fostered by contacts through suicide packs over the Internet. Last week, the Guam Department of Mental Health and Substance reported that about 95 percent of the admissions into the children's unit of the Guam Memorial Hospital are related to suicide intentions. In response to all of this, we have listed five listed budgetary priorities, including a funding increase of $12 million additional for the Office of Minority Health and the Department of Health and Human Services for the REACH initiative in the Center for Disease Control. This is currently funded at $35 million. In fiscal year 2000, the CDC was able to fund only 32 grants, which works in collaboration with OMH and other appropriate Federal agencies, to intensify efforts to eliminate health disparities. However, a funding increase is requested to allow communities to apply for REACH initiative grants. For the National Center for Minority Health and Health Disparities in the NIH, we are asking again for additional funding for the minority ADIS initiative, which was funded in 2001 at $350 million, which is an increase of $100 million over fiscal year 2000. However, the 2001 funding fell short of the original funding request of approximately $540 million. Finally, in fiscal year 2001, SAMSA's minority fellowship program received nearly $2 million over the fiscal year level, for a total of $3 million. A $2 million increase is again requested for fiscal year 2002, to help address the critical needs to enhance the quality and effectiveness of the provision of health and mental health services to community of colors by increasing numbers of well- trained professionals. It is very critically important to understand that the context of the provision of health care services in minority communities is affected by cultural linguistic factors and the lack of, in many instances, trained personnel. I believe that it should be our strong commitment as a Nation to help bridge this gap for the provision of health services, so that we can reduce the disparities, some of which I have outlined here today. Again, I want to thank you, Mr. Chairman, as always. I do not know what other subcommittee you are going to go to next, but I always enjoy appearing in front of you. Thank you very much. [The information follows:] [GRAPHIC(S) NOT AVAILABLE IN TIFF FORMAT] Mr. Regula. I am sure you will have a request, whatever subcommittee it is. [Laughter.] Mr. Rodriguez. ---------- Tuesday, March 27, 2001. CONGRESSIONAL HISPANIC CAUCUS HEALTH CARE TASK FORCE WITNESS HON. CIRO RODRIGUEZ, A REPRESENTATIVE IN CONGRESS FROM THE STATE OF TEXAS AND CHAIR, CONGRESSIONAL HISPANIC CAUCUS HEALTH CARE TASK FORCE Mr. Rodriguez. Mr. Chairman, let me first of all apologize for being a little bit late. As the Chairman of the Hispanic Caucus and member of the VA committee, we had an opportunity to provide some testimony on health, and you will have an opportunity to vote on those bills this afternoon on the VA, which is also very critical for a lot of Hispanic veterans that are out there. But I want to thank you for allowing us the opportunity, as Chairman of the Task Force on Health with the Hispanic Caucus, that has 18 members of the 21 Hispanic members of the Congress, to be here before you. Hispanics continue to experiences barriers in the areas of health care insurance. I want to briefly just mention to you that out of 44 million uninsured Americans in this country, one-quarter of those, or 11 million, are Hispanics. These are individuals that are working. In fact, out of those 11 million that are Hispanics that are uninsured, 9 million are working individuals, that despite the fact that in this country, if you are working for a small company, if you are not working for a major corporation, if you are not working for Government, you do not have access to insurance. Yet, you are not poor enough to qualify for Medicaid; you are not old enough to qualify for Medicare; and you find yourself without any access to insurance. So the importance of the CHIPS Program is critical, and so we want to be supportive of those efforts and encourage the importance of continuing to fund those efforts in that area. The importance of access to health care is one of the things that is lacking in the Hispanic community, and one of the areas that impacts us the most. To address the growing problems, and one which is a negative impact on local health disparities in our local communities, it is important that we continue to move forward in those efforts. Our community health centers that provide a vital safety net for Hispanics and other minorities throughout this country need to continue to be funded. Seventy percent of those served by the community health centers are minority. Sixty-six percent of them live in poverty. The request from our efforts, from the Hispanic Caucus, is that we fund them at $250 million above the current funding levels for the community health centers. President Bush has promised to provide $3.6 billion, over five years, to build additional 1,200 community health centers. We request a $250 million increase. It would put us on the right track to meet the President's needs in this specific area. So we ask for your serious consideration. Hispanics also account for 20 percent of the new AIDS cases. As we look at the issue of AIDS, we see the new data that is there and it looks like we are making some inroads but despite, it is hitting disproporionately a lot of the low income areas. Despite the fact that Hispanics represent 12.5 percent of the population, we represent 20 percent of HIV cases. So we ask for your help and your support in that specific area and request full funding at the level of $539.4 million for year 2002 for the Minority AIDS Initiative to promote capacity building for minority-based organizations. The U.S. Census 2000 shows that Hispanics make up 12.5 percent as I indicated. One of the basic ways of dealing with AIDS is to make sure we have those community-based programs. With the Hispanic community, we have not been able to organize those. We have been lagging behind in resources to fight the issue of AIDS and we need those resources to make sure we establish those community-based organizations to reach out to those pockets that are out there. In the area of diabetes, it strikes Hispanics--especially Mexican Americans and Puerto Ricans--at a disproportionate rate. In addition, growing evidence shows that Type II diabetes and adult onset diabetes increasingly strikes Hispanic children. We are learning more about the relationships. The beauty of this is we have a lot of new research where we can identify those specific areas with young people, with children. We have been able to identify a large number, but now we have to do something about that. We need to move forward. We ask for increased support of $100 million for Hispanic focus on diabetes prevention and treatment. These activities include targeting geographic areas throughout this country that need to be targeted. It doesn't do any good to identify those kids--we are doing it--and not do anything about it. Part of that is the education that goes along with that. So we ask for your help, assistance and your efforts. In the area of mental health and substance abuse, one of the areas that we have neglected as a country and where people have fallen through the cracks, as indicated earlier by my friend, is we are finding a lot of young people. When they first came to tell me we were having a large number of suicides among young ladies of Mexican-American descent, I told them I don't believe it, show me the research. Sure enough, they came to me and it is startling to see the rates of suicides among young Hispanics as well as alcohol and drug abuse. So it becomes important that we look at that area of mental health and substance abuse, and that we provide some resources. President Bush's budget includes an initiative to double NIH funds for 2003. While the Hispanic caucus supports increasing research funding levels, it is important to find ways to encourage Hispanic focused research. The key is toalso look at specific research that targets Hispanic populations with a clear understanding that with what we face, we can then deliver culturally competence. There is example after example and one example that comes to me, which I have been sharing, when we talk about competency and culturally relevant, when this person was told she was positive. When you tell them in positive, then you think everything is okay and sure enough this person later on had a child and contracted AIDS. So there is a need and we should not take things for granted. We need to reach out and make sure people understand, especially when we deal with issues of mental health and the competency and cultural relevancy of reaching out to those individuals. We had another case of mental health with a person in a State hospital in San Antonio who would go out and walk and walk, walk and stop, walk and stop and walk and stop and people would try to stop her. She would get angry and throw a fit. She was actually doing her rosary. She would walk so many steps and would stop and keep on. People didn't understand that. It is important to recognize the importance of cultural competency, language proficiency and what it means. We are going to ask for some funding in that specific area of $3 million. If you want specifics on the funding, I would look forward to meeting with you to provide some of those statistics. The budget also proposes reduced funding to the health professionals which provide training grants to institutions to increase the number of under represented health professions. This is a serious mistake. Right now, every agency in the Federal Government is expecting to retire one-third of our people. We were just told in the GAO report on the military that of 50 percent, 65,000 employees, we are going to retire 32,000 of them, almost half. There is a need for us to invest in apprenticeships. It is important for us to invest in those individuals and make sure that we have good quality professionals. In the area of access to health care, there is a nursing shortage in this country and this is not the time to cut back on these programs. The budget estimates of $125 million for community access programs provides grants to communities, hospital and community health centers that serve uninsured youngsters and is key. Please look at that funding, especially in terms of the apprenticeship programs and providing the health professions the assistance that is needed. We need to go beyond that. We need to make sure we have those qualified professionals out there, those individuals that can be culturally competent and have access to the training that is important and needed. According to the Department of Health and Human Services, there are 3,000 medically under served communities. So we need these grants. Thank you for the time and the opportunity to address the subcommittee on the Congressional Hispanic Caucus priorities and we look forward to working with you. [The information follows:] [GRAPHIC(S) NOT AVAILABLE IN TIFF FORMAT] Mr. Regula. The community health centers have served a very worthwhile role and I hope we can increase those because I think it catches a lot of people who are uninsured and probably not able to get medical care. Mr. Rodriguez. Yes, sir. In fact, 67 percent are uninsured in that category and 70 percent are minority. Mr. Regula. Questions? Ms. Pelosi. I want to thank the two gentlemen for their excellent testimony and Mr. Underwood for his leadership in the Asian Pacific Islander Caucus and Mr. Rodriguez who has been working on this for such a long time. Last year, he was able to get $1.7 million for minority health research and outreach. We are hoping that money will be coming very soon to help in getting a handle on what these needs are. I wanted to bring Congresswoman Christensen in on this as well. As you testified earlier, we are blessed that the former Chair of the Interior Committee is now in the Health seat because he understands the needs of the territories better than anyone. Mr. Regula. I have had a lot of assistance from Mr. Underwood. Thank you both for your interest. Our next witness is Ms. Ros-Lehtinen from Florida. ---------- Tuesday, March 27, 2001. CLOSE UP FOUNDATION WITNESS HON. ILEANA ROS-LEHTINEN, A REPRESENTATIVE IN CONGRESS FROM THE STATE OF FLORIDA Ms. Ros-Lehtinen. We are so thankful to have such a strong organization nationally and in all of our districts. Thank you, Mr. Chairman and members of the subcommittee. We are pleased to submit my testimony in support of the Close Up Foundation's Allen J. Ellender Fellowship Program. During my time in Congress, I have been a strong supporter of Close Up and its civic education programs. As a former educator, I believe the Close Up Foundation Civic Education Program is a valuable weapon in our arsenal to combat disaffection with government among our young people. The Allen J. Ellender Fellowships are vital in reaching out to a diverse group of young people, specifically those in need of financial assistance so that we can enable them to participate in Close Up's unique civic education program. Without the Ellender Fellowship Program, the Close Up Foundation would be unable to reach students who are perhaps more in need of having their importance to our democracy validated. The only criterion for a student to receive an Ellender Fellowship is an income eligibility requirement and student recipients of these fellowships are among the neediest students in our educational system. Impressively, the overwhelming majority of Ellender Fellowship recipients participate in local fundraising activities throughout the year to cover the full cost of the program. The foundation also has special programs to reach students who are recent immigrants to the United States. As a member from Florida, one of the most culturally diverse States in our Nation, I can personally attest to the growing positive influence that these immigrants have had upon the cultural fabric of our Nation and the great contributions that they make every day to our country. They too need to be educated about their adopted homeland and specifically about how our government and our democratic form of government works. Close Up also outreaches to students in our rural towns and urban communities who are beneficiaries of Ellender Fellowship assistance. I understand the subcommittee faces an extremely difficult task in trying to prioritize what programs to fund and at what levels, but I ask you to consider the grave need for civil education programs, and particularly for programs that reach our disadvantaged youth. The Close Up Foundation uses the relatively small appropriations that it receives for the Ellender Fellowship Program as seed money around which educators and students expand their local Close Up programs. I ask that the subcommittee demonstrate its support for Close Up's civic education program by not only maintaining the current $1.5 million funding level for the Allen J. Ellender Fellowship Program but by increasing the funding level. This would send an important signal that we in Congress believe that citizenship education is as important to being a well-rounded individual as knowing math, science and literature. It would be a great investment in the strength and well being of our democracy. I thank the Chairman and I thank the members and the staff. [The information follows:] [GRAPHIC(S) NOT AVAILABLE IN TIFF FORMAT] Mr. Regula. Do you think these young people go back home and take the message of things they learn here in the Close Up Program back to their colleagues? Ms. Ros-Lehtinen. I think so. At least that has been the case in our district office. We encourage them to participate, they come to our district office, put in their time there as well, and go back to their areas, whether they are working in Washington or in the district office and really make it work. They demonstrate that this is a great country where we are given all kinds of opportunities. I thank you for funding it and we hope to be there with even a little more this year. Mr. Regula. Next we have a panel of Mr. Hayworth and Mr. Edward on Impact Aid. We heard from some of our colleagues earlier making a pretty powerful case. I will let Mr. Sherwood take this one. Mr. Sherwood [assuming chair]. Gentlemen. ---------- Tuesday, March 27, 2001. IMPACT AID WITNESS HON. J.D. HAYWORTH, A REPRESENTATIVE IN CONGRESS FROM THE STATE OF ARIZONA Mr. Hayworth. Let me thank the gentleman from Pennsylvania. It is good to see him in the Chair but my joy at seeing him there is eclipsed by the temporary departure of the full Chairman of the Subcommittee who is all too aware of the challenges we confront. I would note for the record that a number of my constituents join me in this chamber here today for this testimony who could offer very eloquent testimony as to just how important this program is. On behalf of all the members of the Impact Aid Coalition, I want to thank you and members of the subcommittee for affording us this opportunity to address what we consider to be a very, very important issue, an issue of critical importance, impact aid. Impact aid is a Federal education program that provides funding to more than 1,500 school districts connected in some way to the Federal Government, whether by an Indian reservation, a military installation, or the designation of Federal land. Traditionally, property sales and personal income taxes account for a large portion of the average school district's annual budget but impact aid schools educate students whose parents may live on nontaxable Federal property, shop at stores that do not generate taxes, work on nontaxable Federal land, or do not pay taxes in their States of residence. School districts could also receive impact aid if some or all of their property was taken off the tax rolls by the Federal Government. As one of the Co-Chairs of the Impact Aid Coalition, I am honored to be here to fight for this important program and I am so pleased the gentleman from Texas, Mr. Edwards, joins me in this endeavor. The Coalition will be sending you a letter requesting your support for its goals of securing $1.19 billion in funding for the Impact Aid Program for fiscal year 2002. While this is an increase of approximately 19 percent over last year's funding level, Mr. Chairman, it is important to note that the amount the Federal Government actually owes impact aid schools for basic support and Federal property payments is more than $2 billion. Increasing impact aid funding to $1.19 billion will be an important step toward fully funding this program which currently receives less than half of its authorized funding. As you may know, the Sixth District of Arizona, which I am honored to represent, is the most federally impacted congressional district in the country. My district alone receives nearly $100 million in impact aid funds. Without these funds, thousands of my young constituents would simply not be educated, constituents who join me today in this hearing room. My district is unique because it has the largest Native American population in the 48 contiguous States, nearly 1 out of every 4 of my constituents is a Native American.Approximately 50 percent of the land mass in my district is tribal land. Many Native American reservations face staggering unemployment rates and other devastating economic conditions. For many children on these reservations, education is their only hope to escape a life of poverty. I am sure you are aware of the Federal Government's treaty obligations to our sovereign Indian tribes and nations. Part of these obligations includes educating these children. It was part of the treaty trust obligation. Without impact aid, the Federal Government cannot live up to those aforementioned treaty obligations. Therefore, I wholeheartedly support the Coalition's goal of securing $1.19 billion for this important program. You know that I am ever critical of wasteful and unnecessary government bureaucracy. Therefore, I am particularly pleased to support impact aid as funds in this program are provided directly to the local school districts for general operating expenses. The use of impact aid funds is determined by locally elected school boards. As you know, the money appropriated by Congress is sent by electronic financial transaction directly to the financial institution of the eligible school district. There is no administrative cost associated with the program. I am also a strong critic of wasteful spending and the inappropriate use of Federal tax dollars that is seen from time to time here in our Nation's Capitol. I am completely committed to maintaining a balanced budget. However, because impact aid services military families and Indian tribes, my colleagues understand this full well. It is an unequivocal Federal responsibility. Through a robust impact aid program, we can demonstrate our commitment to those children who would otherwise be shut out from most educational opportunities. By funding impact aid, at $1.19 billion for fiscal year 2001, we can fulfill our responsibility of providing these educational opportunities to each of our Nation's students. Again, thank you, Mr. Chairman, and members of the subcommittee for inviting members of the Impact Aid Coalition here today to voice our opinions, to be joined by our constituents. I would be happy to remain here to answer any questions you might have. Thank you very much. [The information follows:] [GRAPHIC(S) NOT AVAILABLE IN TIFF FORMAT] Mr. Sherwood. Thank you very much. Now we will hear from the gentleman from Texas. ---------- Tuesday, March 27, 2001. WITNESS HON. CHET EDWARDS, A REPRESENTATIVE IN CONGRESS FROM THE STATE OF TEXAS, ON BEHALF OF THE IMPACT AID PANEL Mr. Edwards. It is an honor for me to join my colleague, J.D., to speak on behalf of the bipartisan 127 House member Impact Aid Coalition. To most Americans, the term impact aid may not mean anything but to 13 million American children, it means the difference between receiving a quality education and a mediocre or poor education. With the Chairman's approval, I would like to submit my written testimony and would like to do something a bit different if I could, and then give back some of my five minutes of time. I would like to put a human face on the statistics behind those 13 million Americans impacted directly by this education program. This comes from a Washington Post article of March 14, a story of one military family. Let me read several excerpts. The first is a letter from an Army Soldier, Randy Roddy who was in Saudi Arabia at the time his son was about to have his second birthday. This is what he wrote to that son. ``As your second birthday rolls around and it is apparent that we will not be able to spend it together, I find it important to write you and tell you some things you need to know. Someday perhaps you will be able to pull out this letter and comprehend.'' He then goes on to say, ``I must start by telling you how proud I am to have you as my son. You never cease to amaze me when I see you on a video cassette. Because of events in this world of ours that are bigger than either you or me, I have not been able to share these last five months with you.'' The article goes on to talk about Mr. Roddy's spouse. It said, meanwhile at Ft. Bliss in the Texas desert, Lisa had her own struggles raising their child, working a receptionist job to supplement their pay, soothing the fragile emotions of several dozen wives whose husbands served in Randy's command. ``They look to me,'' she said, ``as a troop commander's wife. I helped deliver two babies, I helped when someone's car was repossessed. One wife tried to kill herself and her three children and called me.'' The articles goes on and says, ``You don't just join the Army, the whole family does.'' It talks about Mr. Roddy's four-year-old child, a little girl, who lost all of her hair because of being distraught when her father was deployed to Korea on a company tour for a year. The reason I mention the story of the Roddy family is it is clear we underpay our military soldiers and their families, all of our troops from all services. It is clear to our Military Construction Subcommittee that 60 percent of our military families live in housing that does not meet basic DOD standards. The reason I mention that is it seems to me if we can't pay our military soldiers and their families what they deserve, if we ask them to live in substandard housing, if we ask their families to spend month upon month away from loved ones serving our country, risking their lives for you, me and our families, the very least we should do as a country for these families is to say to them while you are serving your country and risking your life, we are going to ensure that your children will receive a quality education. I think the story of the Roddy family tells the story of the importance of impact aid. Whether it is Native American children or children of military families, amidst the many important competing priorities that you must set, I hope this subcommittee would once again remember the importance of funding adequately the Impact Aid Program. I would like to look at Mrs. Roddy who will be before our Military Construction Subcommittee in a few weeks and say, despite all of the difficulties and perhaps some of the things we ask you to sacrifice, we will see that your children receive a quality education. That has happened in the past, Mr. Chairman, because of the members of this subcommittee and we respectfully ask, on behalf of the Coalition and these 13 million children for whom we speak, that you please continue that leadership effort and support fully funding for impact aid. [The information follows:] [GRAPHIC(S) NOT AVAILABLE IN TIFF FORMAT] Mr. Sherwood. Thank you both very much for your exceptional and compelling testimony. Two years ago at a readiness hearing in Italy with our distinguished late chairman of the Readiness Committee, Mr. Bateman, I was talking with some military personnel there and made almost the same statement you did. When our brave young men and women are defending us around the world, the least we can do is see there is a good education for their children. In all these areas where the Federal Government, by treaty or law, has denied these school districts of revenue that would normally be there, we have to step up to the plate, so we will take a strong look at it. Mr. Hayworth. One note. We should point out that though my friend from Texas concentrated on military dependents and I talked about some of the challenges facing tribes, these concerns are not mutually exclusive. If you take a look at those who answer the call to military service, tribal members, Native Americans, more than any other group, answer the call to military service. So there is a connected interrelationship here. I would appreciate the committee taking that into account. I commend my friend from Texas for very eloquent testimony about what is faced by military dependents. You can see on the faces of my constituents here and they could offer very profound testimony from their real life experience. I appreciate your hearing us and the Chair's indulgence for this time this afternoon. Mr. Sherwood. The gentleman from New York, Mr. Fossella. ---------- Tuesday, March 27, 2001. JUVENILE DIABETES RESEARCH WITNESS HON. VITO J. FOSSELLA, A REPRESENTATIVE IN CONGRESS FROM THE STATE OF NEW YORK Mr. Fossella. Thank you for providing me the opportunity to testify today. I would like to thank you and this committee for continuing the effort to double the budget of the National Institute of Health by the year 2003. Since being elected to Congress, I have been a strong supporter of meaningful funding for the National Institute of Health, and I applaud the President's recent announcement that he will seek increased funding for life-saving medical research at the NIH. I would pause to thank publicly all those dedicated professionals employed by the NIH and all health care professionals publicly and privately who dedicate their lives to try to improve the human condition. Politics is a lot of things to a lot of people but one thing we can agree upon is that we can all work together to improve the human condition. We have seen it time and time again where illnesses we thought could never be solved have led individuals to lead better lives. As far as I am concerned, our best days are ahead. Of special concern to me is meaningful funding for the National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases for fiscal year 2002. Finding a cure for Type I diabetes is absolutely doable and with congressional support, it will happen. No one in my parents' generation ever imagined a human being would travel in space, let alone land on the moon but on May 25, 1961, President Kennedy stood before a joint session of Congress to declare it ``time for a great new American enterprise.'' Then in 1969, what seemed impossible became reality. I believe we are now in a time of a great American enterprise, a time when we are closer than ever before to not only helping the millions who currently suffer from the insidious condition of diabetes but laying the foundation for future generations to live their lives free of this disease. It is not just a health issue, it happens to be an economic one as well. Diabetes happens to be a very costly disease to our Nation and accounts for approximately $105 billion in direct and indirect health care costs. One out of ten health care dollars overall are spent on individuals with this disease. I understand the World Health Organization estimates there are 125 million people worldwide with diabetes. This number has increased 15 percent in the last 10 years and is actually expected to double by the year 2005. In the U.S., the CDC refers to diabetes as ``a major public health threat of epidemic proportions.'' Ten million people in our Nation have already been diagnosed with diabetes while an estimated 6 million have diabetes but are undiagnosed. To put that in prospective, onaverage, there is an estimated 23,000 people diagnosed and another 14,000 undiagnosed in every congressional district across the country. More important than the costs are the lives this disease takes. Each year, 193,000 people die from complications from this disease. That is one every three minutes. Clearly a cure must be found and I believe it will be. Great and promising strides have recently been made in funding a cure for Type I diabetes. The contributions must continue and with your assistance, I am confident a cure will be discovered during our lifetime. Researchers are collaborating on many new treatments and others on the identification of the genetic components of diabetes. One of these promising treatments is known as the Edmonton Protocol for Eyelet Cell Transplantation. This is a process where insulin-producing cells called eyelet cells are removed from the pancreas and transplanted to a diabetic patient. The success rate has been extremely encouraging. The researchers in Edmonton, Canada have announced they were successful in transplanting the insulin producing eyelet cells into a number of men and women with Type I diabetes resulting in the discontinued use of insulin injections which is the scourge of millions who suffer from it. To date, more than 16 men and women have received this transplant and 100 percent remain off insulin entirely. Researchers are further studying this transplantation without the need of the dreaded immunosuppressant drugs. The Edmonton Protocol has given the diabetic community great hope for a cure. Clinical trials of this extraordinary transplantation will be taking place and are taking place here in the United States. The procedure may not be helpful to children because it requires the use of the immunosuppressant drugs I mentioned before. Children's fragile bodies simply cannot withstand these very strong drugs. It is my hope that continued research with your support and members of this committee and indeed all of Congress, will soon enable more adults and even children to utilize eyelet transplantation. Our support is crucial to capitalize on the success of eyelet cell transplantation and to shorten the timeline to cure that we know is within our grasp. Mr. Chairman, you have been a leading advocate in this in playing an important role in encouraging increased research of diabetes and particularly Type I diabetes. Last year, Congress and the White House approved a 60 percent increase, the largest ever in juvenile diabetes research funding at the NIH. This increased funding will allow researchers to explore new opportunities to cure diabetes. It is my hope that Congress remains committed to helping to find a cure for diabetes. The time is now, the cure is within our grasp. It is not just the individuals, it is the families that are affected adversely, the 18-month-olds, the two-year- olds that have to live and forever live until a cure is found with the six to eight times a day of pin pricks and two, three and four injections. All we would like to do is help them live a normal and healthy life. [The information follows:] [GRAPHIC(S) NOT AVAILABLE IN TIFF FORMAT] Mr. Regula [resuming chair]. I understand. I have had some families from my district visit with me and I know the difficulty it creates for everyone involved. We do hope we can get a cure. It would be a wonderful thing to get a breakthrough on that. I know NIH is pursuing research very aggressively, especially using cell process as you described. That would be a wonderful thing if we could. We will do all we can. Mr. Fossella. Thank you, sir. Mr. Regula. Mr. Wu, you get the honor of being the last one today. ---------- Tuesday, March 27, 2001. PROJECTS WITNESS HON. DAVID WU, A REPRESENTATIVE IN CONGRESS FROM THE STATE OF OREGON Mr. Wu. Thank you. I thank you for the opportunity to testify before the subcommittee today. As you prepare the fiscal year 2002 appropriations bills, I would like to bring to your attention several projects from my congressional district that I think are worthy of national attention. I am seeking $2.5 million from the Fund for the improvement of post-secondary education to support the Mark O. Hatfield School of Government at Portland State University. It is named in honor of Oregon's most prominent and distinguished national leaders and has been a solid academic center for the advancement of education and research about public service. The money will be used to fund faculty and staff and support students at the school and the various research institutions such as the Institute for Tribal Government which the larger committee helped fund last year. Among the activities that will be funded is advanced education for elected and appointed officials at all levels of government, including those at non-profit organizations and other public institutions. In addition, funds will be used to increase the awareness of the importance of public service and to foster among young Americans greater recognition of the role of public service in the development of United States and to promote public service as a career choice. There is an extensive history of Federal funding for the Hatfield School of Government. Congress approved funding for the school in fiscal year 1999 and 2000 and last year as I noted funding was approved for the Institute of Tribal Government, an institution unique in the 50 States to study and support tribal governments. The second project I would like to mention briefly is a million dollar request from the Fund for the Improvement of Education for the Portland Metropolitan Partnership. We talk a lot about improving primary and secondary teaching but without strong leadership from the top, I don't believe that progress is possible. This program at Portland State University is aimed at providing that kind of leadership within schools. Third, I am seeking $2 million from the Administration on Aging for Oregon Health Sciences University for the second phase of the Center for Healthy Aging. The subcommittee supported the first phase of this project with a $1 million appropriation in fiscal year 2000. This demonstration project promotes health and prolonged independence by coaching participants and connecting them with resources to bring about positive changes in health behaviors and status. Here I would like to go off the written track a bit by mentioning that Oregon is among that handful of States thathas really innovated in helping older Americans achieve and maintain independence for longer periods of time. This not only gives older Americans their choice of lifestyles because I think many would prefer to stay as independent as long as possible, but in addition, it helps save the Federal Government money because if we don't have to institutionalize people, it is a significant savings. The Center on Health Aging's purpose is disseminate a clinical model which works both for older Americans and for our public purse. It is a worthwhile project this committee has seen fit to fund in the past. About two weeks ago, this subcommittee heard from Dr. Grover Bagby, the Director of the Oregon Cancer Center at OHSU. Dr. Bagby addressed the growing shortage of nurses faced by academic as well as rural health centers. The baby boom generation has provided its share of nurses and as a result, we will be facing large scale retirements soon. OHSU is expecting that 45 percent of the nursing faculty will retire within four years and because of this, we are attempting to alleviate the nursing shortage through the Laboratory for Teaching Technology application and innovation in nursing at OHSU. I am requesting $1.9 million from the Health Resources and Services Administration, Rural Health Outreach Grant Account. Without the teaching nurses at OHSU, we do not expect to be able to get nurses into the rural parts of the State nearly as effectively as we otherwise could. Finally, I hope you will be able to support a small portion of the Columbia River Estuary Research Program through the Fund for the Improvement of Post Secondary Education. We are seeking funding to train scientists, students and faculty for this program. Last year, the subcommittee supported the program through an appropriation to establish certificate and graduate degree programs in environmental information technology. We are seeking to continue that programmatic development and training. I might add I became familiar with this program several years ago as a private citizen. It is an amazing public/private partnership where this research institution has basically gone to the mouth of the Columbia River, one of the major estuaries of the U.S. west or anywhere in America, and by studying the currents, studying temperature, salinity, water density and flows, by being able to predict where things wind up, these folks are better able to help ships navigate the Columbia River, help salmon smelts navigate downstream to get out to the ocean, help predict where pollutants will wind up. There is an obvious hardware component of this program but there is a very important human and training component to this program. That is where we are seeking help from this subcommittee. It is a well leveraged and well worthwhile program. I thank the committee for its attention to these programs of importance to Oregon and am ready to answer any questions you may have. [The information follows:] [GRAPHIC(S) NOT AVAILABLE IN TIFF FORMAT] Mr. Regula. Thank you. Sounds like you have some interesting projects. Is the School of Government at Portland something like what they have at Harvard with the Kennedy School? Mr. Wu. In essence, it is our northwest version of the Kennedy School, yes, or the midwest version of the Hubert Humphrey School or the LBJ School. Mr. Regula. The aging project sounds interesting. You are trying to help older people stay independent for a longer period of time? Mr. Wu. That is an important goal. Perhaps that is a primary goal along with helping them to stay healthier longer. Mr. Regula. That goes along with it. You can't be independent if you are not healthy. Mr. Wu. That is right. And at a fixed health status, if you will. We want to help people stay healthier but at one fixed health status, if you are able to coach the individual and also bring together community resources to focus on the individual, if the individual can reach out to the resources and bring community resources to bear, at the same health status that person might be tempted to go into an institution whereas if you bring the services together in the right way and empower the individual. Mr. Regula. You make the community more friendly to independence? Mr. Wu. Yes. Mr. Regula. Do you involve the family? A lot of times this would take education of families for support members. Does the program involve family members too? Mr. Wu. Absolutely. In this program there is a very strong educational component for the family and I should say outside of this program in the general model, there is the availability for some State funding of family members so that family members can take more time away from other things and be more appropriate and more effective caregivers to fellow family members. Mr. Regula. Sounds like a very worthwhile program. Mr. Wu. It is something that had a bit of room to run in a few other States and no where has it gone as far as it has especially in the Klamath Valley part of the State of Oregon. If we can make this model effective and try to replicate it elsewhere, I have heard academicians from around the country discuss how this would make people happier by keeping them independent but be a major cost savings to the Federal Government. Mr. Regula. I think that is absolutely right on both counts. Do you have Klamath Valley? Mr. Wu. No, I do not. It is Mr. Walden's good fortune to have the Klamath Basin. Mr. Regula. It would be further east. Mr. Wu. A bit to the east and to the south. Mr. Regula. Do you have the city? Mr. Wu. Most of my congressional district is rural but I also have the urban core of Portland, the financial district, the most urban parts of Portland through the high tech suburbs but two-thirds or three-quarters of my congressional district is actually forestland or agricultural land. Mr. Regula. What corps or cattle? Mr. Wu. Not much in the way of cattle but we have a lot of orchards, a lot of nursery stock as it became too costly to run nurseries in southern California, a lot of the nursery folks came up to my neck of the woods, and hazelnuts or filberts as we prefer to call them in the northwest and I think some of the best wines in America. Mr. Regula. You must have a somewhat temperature climate there? Mr. Wu. Yes. It is a temperate climate more like the Mendocino coast or the burgundy kind of climates in Europe. We are so far north that our vinters have the challenge of highly variable growing seasons. That creates both the best of times and the worst of times as agriculture tends to do. Mr. Regula. Thank you for coming. The committee is adjourned until 10:00 a.m. tomorrow. Tuesday, April 3, 2001. McKINNEY EDUCATION FOR HOMELESS CHILDREN AND YOUTH WITNESS HON. JUDY BIGGERT, A REPRESENTATIVE IN CONGRESS FROM THE STATE OF ILLINOIS Mr. Regula. I call the committee to order. We have four panelists. You are not the ones that were scheduled for Panel 1, but we have four of you, so I am just going to go ahead and then as the others come in, we will use them on Panel 2 or Panel 3. I would be interested to hear what you have to say, and I know these are tough issues. We will start out with you Mrs. Biggert. Try to stick to 5 minutes, if possible. Mrs. Biggert. Thank you, Mr. Chairman and distinguished members of the subcommittee, who aren't here, but I will say hello to them anyway. Mr. Regula. This is not unusual. That is why I get the extra pay. Mrs. Biggert. I am sure they will join you as time goes on. As the Republican cochair for the Congressional Women's Caucus, I am pleased to have the opportunity for our members to testify today. Every year this forum has provided the caucus an opportunity to come together as a bipartisan group to discuss issues affecting women throughout the United States. And I would like to thank you again for extending us the opportunity for this year. Today I would like to express any support for the McKinney Education for Homeless Children and Youth, the EHCY program, and I respectfully request the subcommittee to appropriate $70,000,000 for this program in fiscal year 2002. Children represent one of the fastest growing segments of the homeless population. In fact, an estimated 1,000,000 children and youth will experience homelessness this year, a situation that will have devastating impact on their educational advancement. Because of their unstable situation, these children face significant hurdles in obtaining an education. Studies show that homeless children have four times the rate of delayed development, are twice as likely to repeat a grade, and are more susceptible to homelessness as adults. EHCY removes these obstacles to education for homeless children and has made a real difference in the lives of many children and families. Yet, appropriations for the McKinney Education Program, the only Federal education program targeted to these children, have not kept up with demand for services or inflation. Despite the increase in homelessness, Congress did not increase the funding for this program at all from 1995 until 2000. When Congress did finally increase the funding in 2001, it appropriated $35,000,000 for the program an increase of just $6,200,000. The lack of adequate funding for this program has been a major barrier to educating homeless children and youth. According to a recent national survey, in 1997 States were only able to serve 37 percent of school-aged children identified to be in this difficult situation. Compounding the problem is the poor collection of data on homeless children. States often do not have the resources to conduct the necessary assessments, and the lack of a uniform method of data collection has resulted in unreliable national data and the possible underreporting of homeless children. Earlier this month the subcommittee heard testimony from Lois Ferguson on behalf of the National Coalition for the Homeless. She gave emotional testimony about her experiences with homelessness and how the EHCY program had benefited her family. EHCY can make a real difference in many more lives, but only if the funding is there. I understand and appreciate the enormous budget constraints under which this subcommittee is working. However, I believe there is no better time than now to renew and strengthen Congress' financial commitment to helping provide homeless children with access to a quality education. I ask that you match the $70,000,000 that the Senate Health, Education, Labor, and Pensions Committee has recommended for the program in fiscal year 2002. By doing so, you will be reaching out to homeless children, helping to ensure that they don't lose out on what is guaranteed for all our children, a free public education. You also will be meeting President Bush's call to leave no child behind. Thank you very much for allowing me to testify today. [The information follows:] [GRAPHIC(S) NOT AVAILABLE IN TIFF FORMAT] Mr. Regula. Do you think the faith-based, if that program does develop, would be one group that might offer some services for these children? Mrs. Biggert. I think that is one way to address it. But what really concerns me is getting them back into a school system immediately and no red tape. And I think that the amount of money to do that, to have help financially for the ombudsman, and then the awareness that they know they can go to a school right away. And spreading $70,000,000 even over 50 States doesn't go very far. Mr. Regula. I notice you are close to Chicago. They have had some enlightened programs in their school system. Has the Chicago system done anything innovative in providing these services? Mrs. Biggert. What we did in Illinois--and, in fact, I have introduced the homeless education bill, which is in the reauthorization of the K-through-12 program, and that is the model that we use for that program. So Illinois has a very great model for all the States in the education of children, and it is working very well there. And even, in fact, just a couple of weeks ago one of my schools, you would not think would have homeless children in it, it really worked out a program for a couple of kids that were homeless and didn't know where to go were enrolled in school; and they had the ombudsman that was provided in this program. So it really is working there. It was brought to my attention from other States, saying why can't we have the same kind of program. Mr. Regula. I guess it takes local initiative, because we had $35,000,000 last year, which obviously is not enough. Mrs. Biggert. Well, you know, for the homeless centers just to be able to provide not only for education, but to be able to provide for all the homeless and particularly the children. Mr. Regula. I am sure it is a severe problem. ---------- Tuesday, April 3, 2001. THE WELLNESS OF WOMEN WITNESS HON. JUANITA MILLENDER-McDONALD, A REPRESENTATIVE IN CONGRESS FROM THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA Mr. Regula. Mrs. McDonald. Ms. Millender-McDonald. Thank you, Mr. Chairman, and good morning to you. Mr. Chairman, as the co-chair of the Women's Caucus, I am proud to come this morning. And we thank you for the opportunity to come before you this morning to again lay out our agenda for women and women's health. I am proud to have the women who have come this morning as a strong showing of advocacy for women across this country, especially the women who know of the myriad of health issues and problems that we see. I have testified in the past, Mr. Chairman, before you and others, on the need for us to look at the National Bone Marrow Program, telemedicine, breast, cervical, and lung cancers, fibroid tumors and other critical health issues. I was very pleased and very happy to have sat in the audience when the President mentioned his increase in funding in his budget for NIH. I respectfully request then that the 16.5 percent that the NIH is requesting for the various outlines of health issues that I will talk to this morning really be put in the budget, that is, $3,400,000,000 for NIH so that we can see some improvement in women's health. We have chosen for our theme this 107th Congress ``The Wellness of Women,'' and we certainly want, in our efforts and others' efforts, to promote and preserve women's health. As you know, heart disease is the number one killer for American women. Studies suggest that women are more likely than men to die from a heart attack, and women who recover from a heart attack are more likely than men to have a stroke or another heart attack. In fact, 44 percent of women die within a year following a heart attack compared to 27 percent of men. CDC is asking for $50 million to expand community education programs in 35 States for cardiovascular health programs. Another illness, Mr. Chairman, is that of cancer. It is the second leading killer of American women claiming 43,900 women in 1997. So early detection coupled with improved treatments has led to a decline in breast cancer rates, as well as cervical cancer, if women do get Pap smear tests. However, lung cancer has become the number one killer for women in terms of cancer in the cancer category, so we are asking, as well as the CDC, for the National Breast, Cervical, and Lung Cancer the Early Detection Program in the amount of $210,000,000 so that we can try to grapple with this whole notion of women and lung cancer, as well as cervical and breast cancers. Another disease that is really crippling women is that of lupus. Lupus affects one out of every 185 Americans. Although lupus can occur at any age and in either sex, 90percent of the victims with lupus are women. During the child-bearing years, lupus strikes women 10 to 15 times more frequently than men. And so we are asking for again, the NIH appropriation for lupus at $55,200,000. We are also--and the final thing that I would like to address is diabetes, the fourth leading cause of death in African American, Native Americans and Hispanic women, the sixth leading cause in Asian women and the seventh leading cause in white women. An estimated 16,000,000 Americans have diabetes, but only 10,600,000 cases are diagnosed, of which 4,200,000 are women. Left untreated, diabetes can lead to severe vision loss, heart disease, stroke, kidney disease, and amputation of the lower limbs. The current NIH appropriation earmarked for diabetes is only 65 percent of the funding necessary. Therefore, I am asking for 1,500,000,000, which is 100 percent of the funding needed to address this single most costly disease in America. Mr. Chairman I was really thrown aback when I went to one of the clinics in my district to find that young African American women, ages 25 to 35, are really being crippled with visual impairments due to diabetes because they do not have health insurance. And so we are asking for this increased funding for education programs, for research, and for treatment of women. We know that women now are making up 52 percent of the heads of households; there must be a wellness among women for them to continue to be sometimes the only breadwinner for our children. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. Mr. Regula. Thank you. I might mention to you, we did go to the Centers for Disease Control yesterday, nine of the committee members and the staff. It was a very interesting day, and they mentioned some of the things that you just brought out. Ms. Millender-McDonald. Thank you. Mr. Regula. I think one of the problems in diabetes is that people don't know they have it until their vision and some of the things you just mentioned becomes evident of it. Ms. Millender-McDonald. I will be following them. And thank you so much; the CDC and NIH I will be working with them, so I do thank you. Mr. Regula. They do a nice job. We will be hard-pressed to do all the things that we need to do---- Ms. Millender-McDonald. I know that is right. Mr. Regula [continuing]. With what is allocated to us, but we are going to give it a try. [The information follows:] [GRAPHIC(S) NOT AVAILABLE IN TIFF FORMAT] Tuesday, April 3, 2001. WOMEN IN SMALL BUSINESSES WITNESS HON. SHELLEY MOORE CAPITO, A REPRESENTATIVE IN CONGRESS FROM THE STATE OF WEST VIRGINIA Mr. Regula. Mrs. Capito. Ms. Capito. Thank you, Mr. Chairman, for allowing me to come here today and give you some brief and very general testimony. Wellness of women--I am the Vice Chair of the Women's Caucus--I am talking more wellness of women in terms of their economic wellness. In recent years women have made great strides in the workplace, especially as entrepreneurs. Between the years of 1987 and 1997 the number of women-owned businesses has increased 89 percent, and today there are more than 8,500,000 small business owners in the United States that are women, and many in West Virginia, my home State. The small business has been and always will be the key to the American dream, especially for women and other minorities. But erecting and ignoring government barriers that hinder their success will slow their creation of and stifle their growth. In February of this year, six of my constituents received Small Business Administration loans; three of those business owners were women. Although they were very happy to receive the financial support, they probably would have been happier if the government would remove some of the unnecessary regulations that prevent them from doing such things as offering expanded health insurance policies to their employees or creating new jobs, all things that could be done with the costs that they expend jumping through the hoops of government bureaucracy. Women need to have better access for financing, for they are small businesses. As leaders entrusted with this responsibility, we need to be vigilant and recognize these needless barriers that burden our small businesses. So we have to be aware that we need to not tolerate the unnecessary obstacles that prevent women and minorities from the American dream. I can't help but wonder how many more women or minority entrepreneurs we could have if we made starting and running a small business a little bit easier. So today I would like to ask that we work together to preserve and extend the ideas of the American dream, and let's send this message that the true entrepreneurial spirit is available to them. Thank you for letting me make this general statement. I appreciate you listening. Mr. Regula. Thank you. [The information follows:] [GRAPHIC(S) NOT AVAILABLE IN TIFF FORMAT] Mr. Regula. I read a comment the other day that--I think it was Germany's czar for production said, if his country had used women as effectively as the United States, it could have had a pretty substantial impact on their ability to fight World War II. He recognized--fortunately, belatedly--that women are very--and I think that was a unique phenomenon in the United States, the impact of the women on the war effort. Rosie the Riveter truly was a very great part of it. And the point you make is well taken that the role has expanded. When I came here there were 18 in the House, now we have how many? Mrs. Biggert. Sixty-one. Mr. Regula. There was one in the Senate. Now there are nine. Ms. Capito. Watch out. Mr. Regula. None on the Court and now we have two, of course. I was startled to sit with a lady the other day who had three or four stars, which is kind of unique too. Times have changed, fortunately for the better. Stephanie, you are on the third panel, but I will just take Louise and then we will come to you. ---------- Tuesday, April 3, 2001. NIH OFFICE OF RESEARCH ON WOMEN'S HEALTH WITNESS HON. LOUISE M. SLAUGHTER, A REPRESENTATIVE IN CONGRESS FROM THE STATE OF NEW YORK Mr. Regula. Mrs. Slaughter. Ms. Slaughter. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. Good morning to you and Ms. DeLauro. I guess, in view of this conversation, it is probably good to point out this is Equal Pay Day, and women in the United States are still only paid 78 cents to the male dollar. So we are making some progress, but it is going pretty slow there. And we have contributed a great deal; we do want to be recognized. I do appreciate the opportunity to testify before the subcommittee on issues that are important to the Women's Caucus. As a Vice Chair of the caucus, I speak on behalf of all my colleagues when I say that we look forward to continuing our excellent working relationship with this subcommittee under your leadership. I would like to highlight briefly two issues that are extremely important to the health of American women. The first is women's health research at the National Institutes of Health and particularly the efforts of the NIH's Office of Research on Women's Health. This is a tiny office with a monumental mission. It has a threefold mandate to, one, strengthen, develop, and increase research into diseases, disorders, and conditions that affect women, determine gaps in knowledge about such conditions and diseases, and establish a research agenda for NIH for the future directions in women's health research; Second, to ensure that women are included as participants in NIH-supported research; and Third, to develop opportunities and support for recruitment, retention, reentry and advancement of women in biomedical careers. Under the leadership of Dr. Vivian Pinn, this office has made major inroads on all of these issues. Its progress is hampered, however, by a lack of resources. Over the past 4 years they have received paltry budget increases, especially given the fact that Congress is working to double the NIH budget. For fiscal year 2000, NIH received a budget increase of 14 percent, but the ORWH budget was increased less than 4 percent. It is currently carrying out its mission with a $22,000,000 budget and, by contrast, the new Center for Minority Health and Health Disparities is funded at $132,000,000 for fiscal year 2001 and the Office of AIDS Research at $48,200,000. Last year I organized a letter from 22 women Members to Acting Director Ruth Kirschstein asking her to increase the budget. It is my understanding that she has requested a respectable budget increase for the Office of Research on Women's Health for fiscal year 2002. I hope the subcommittee will not only fund this request fully, but include language in the accompanying report encouraging the future permanent director to maintain this commitment. And that is a very important step. I would like to turn now to the other issue on my agenda, which is environmental health. The interplay between an individual's genetic predisposition to disease and the environment is not well understood. The evidence is clear and accumulating daily, however, that the by-products of our technology are linked to illness and that women are especially susceptible to these environmental health-related problems. There are many reasons for that, the makeup of a woman's body containing more fatty tissue, more exposure to household chemicals, and the like. You may have seen or heard Bill Moyers' recent report, titled ``Trade Secrets.'' Mr. Moyers detailed the fact that the chemical industry has kept confidential documents over the past 50 years about adverse health effects of workplace chemical exposures on their employees. In addition, a recent CDC report showed that all Americans have traces of pesticides, metals, and plasticizers in our blood and urine. What does this mean for our health? We don't know. However, the chemical industry has also provided great benefits to society through industrial and technical advancement. It is a question of benefit versus risk, but we need to at least understand the risk to make an assessment. I urge the subcommittee to provide increased funding for the National Institute of Environmental Health Sciences to enhance the research on environmental causes of disease so that we may improve the public health of America. This investment will save the lives and health of people who today suffer needlessly because we lack the scientific data to understand the effect of environment of exposures on human health. Mr. Chairman, I would like to note that I am proud to have recently introduced H.R. 183, the Women's Health Environmental Research Centers Act, a bill that will enhance scientific research in women's health and the environment and will fill a gap in the NIEHS research agenda by targeting resources to women's environmental health. NIEHS fully supports the initiative, and I would very much like to work with you, Mr. Chairman, on empowering the agency to create these research centers. Again, thank you very much for the opportunity to address you on these important issues. [The information follows:] [GRAPHIC(S) NOT AVAILABLE IN TIFF FORMAT] Mr. Regula. Thank you. I might mention that at CDC they have one section on environmental health generally. An interesting footnote, they said they could take a sample of your blood and tell you all the various components how much arsenic is in it, how much all the various metals. Ms. DeLauro was there. You want to go ahead and ask some questions or comments. Ms. Slaughter. They can tell you almost everything from a drop of blood, including all the diseases that you have had as a child. It is a remarkable fluid that we have here. As former microbiologist, I am very fond of it. Mr. Regula. I like a good supply myself. Ms. DeLauro. I will just briefly comment to Mrs. Slaughter it was a really fascinating what the CDC is doing--I was there with the group yesterday--particularly in this area and what we could do by way of tracking illnesses and so forth and dealing with genetic predispositions. So your words are well taken. Ms. Slaughter. Three to 4 percent of breast cancer in women is genetically linked; the rest of it must be environmental. So we need to study this very closely. Mr. Regula. Staff advises me that we are probably getting a larger allocation on the women's health issues. Ms. Slaughter. Thank you. I am so happy to hear that. Thank you very much. Mr. Regula. Mrs. Lowey. Mrs. Lowey. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. I personally want to thank you and thank the entire Women's Caucus. This is always the highlight of the presentations for us. And I want to particularly associate myself with your comments on environmental health. To date, they really haven't done enough work in that area. And I feel there so strongly the mapping we have done in New York, the coincidences between high rates in particular areas--not only New York, San Francisco, around the country. I think this is something that we have to continue looking at. I have always been interested in the work of Stephanie Coburn and the connections of her research with cancer. So I want to thank you and the entire Caucus for your presentations. Ms. DeLauro. I can explain it to my colleagues; I have to leave at 10:30. Pay Equity Day it is, and there is a press conference about the Paycheck Fairness Act, which, as my colleagues know, is a piece of legislation most of them are on for pay equity for women; and we are going to do that over on the Senate side this morning. But I just wanted to say, this is an unbelievable committee. When I first came, it was a 15-member committee. In terms of the representation for women, there are three Democratic members, there were two Republican members. I can go back and think about when it was Mrs. Pelosi, Mrs. Lowey, and myself, and Helen Bentley on the other side--a feisty, wonderful woman. But I think, Mr. Chairman, in terms of focus of this committee and where it goes and what it does not only on just women's health and those issues, but broadly, with the portfolio that exists in the committee, that I think women have made a difference; and the women members who come before this committee every single year talk about issues that face this Nation broadly and, I think, make a remarkable contribution to what is being done. Just one additional thing: When I first came here, it was only 10 years ago, I worked with women here who were courageous in charting the waters for the NIH, doing clinical trials for women and for minorities, and for there to be an Office of Women's Health at HHS; and because of the tenacity of the women who served in this body longer than 10 years ago--I look at people like Louise, Nita was here, it is people like Pat Schroeder and Barbara Kennelly and Nancy Johnson who charted the way--Connie Morella. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. I apologize to my colleagues for interrupting your testimony. Mr. Regula. Mr. Kennedy. Mr. Kennedy. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. I understand from my colleagues, Nita Lowey and RosaDeLauro, that they both have meetings at 10:30. This makes my arrival just right, so I can carry on for them when they leave. So I just want to thank you guys and say again, like Rosa said, this is a great committee and I really look forward to working on it. On the pay equity, we had a wonderful press conference and committee hearing up in Rhode Island about 2 weeks ago. The response was overwhelming. My local newspaper carried it front page, the whole story. My colleagues in the State legislature are pressing for it; they say they are not going to go for a budget that doesn't include it within State payroll. So it is not just equal pay, but pay equity, that there is a point system for jobs so that, you know, given experience and the duties of the job, that is going to be the criterion by which people are paid, not a set, you know, number of jobs that are set up. So anyway, thank you, Mr. Chairman. Thank you, my colleagues. Mr. Regula. Mr. Sherwood. Mr. Sherwood. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. I am looking forward to listening to my esteemed colleagues and helping them work on this very important program. Thank you. Mr. Regula. Well, thank all of you on the first panel. And I just want to tell you, if my wife and daughter were here, they would be cheering you on. Ms. Slaughter. I am sure you will, as well. ---------- Tuesday, April 3, 2001. NORTHEAST OHIO NEIGHBORHOOD HEALTH CENTERS WITNESS HON. STEPHANIE TUBBS JONES, A REPRESENTATIVE IN CONGRESS FROM THE STATE OF OHIO Mr. Regula. Our next panel. We have the three--oh, here is Connie. Don't wait. We will go ahead. Is Connie on panel 4? That is all right. Okay. It is very informal here. Okay, we will take them in the order I have them here. But you were here early, so we will start with you, Stephanie. Mrs. Jones. I appreciate you giving me the opportunity to plead. Mr. Chairman, the Congressional Black Caucus is holding election reform hearings somewhere in this building. I am trying to get over there to all my colleagues. Good morning. Just for the record I would like to add to the names of some people who have been working in the past on the issue of women's health: Mary Rose Oakar, as well as my predecessor, Louis Stokes. I got that in. I appreciate your extending time for me to relate some of the very urgent concerns of the 11th Congressional District regarding the provision of health care at federally qualified community health centers. Northeast Ohio Neighborhood Health Centers is located in the heart of Cleveland and serves some of the most impoverished neighborhoods in the city. As in most large cities, large hospital health care providers have been migrating out of the inner city. The end result of this migration is many more uninsured for our health care centers to serve. The majority of constituents served by these centers live under 100 percent of the Federal poverty line. Many of these people are now working but remain uninsured because their jobs do not provide health benefits. The rollout of Ohio's SCHIP has helped. SCHIP covers children who live at up to 200 percent of Federal poverty level. Moreover, the State of Ohio has expanded coverage to adults living at 100 percent of the Federal poverty level. The Northeast Ohio Neighborhood Centers have experienced an increase of almost 10 percent in the uninsured patient base in the last year, partially due to hospital closings. NEON is not the only provider that has suffered immensely from managed care in our city. Approximately one-half of NEON's 35,000 patients are children. Approximately 28,000 of those 35,000 patients live under 100 percent of the poverty level. Many of them have mental health or drug and alcohol problems as well as diabetes, hypertension, cancer or high-risk pregnancies, as well as other health issues that often parallel living in poverty. Twenty-three physicians and six dentists logged more than 115,000 encounters in the year 2000. NEON provides transportation, translation and counseling to encourage and empower patients. Despite the hospital closings, managed care and numerous other earth tremors in the health care system, NEON's community-based system of five health care center sites is still open and providing care. I will skip over only to say that the neighborhood health centers need additional support for them to continue to be able to provide care. In my district we lost two large hospitals in this control of the health care delivery system; and only on Sunday, in the Plain Dealer newspaper, it was reported that many of the hospitals are diverting patients. They close down their EMS center, their emergency room; and, therefore, the EMS trucks have to go to the next hospital, the next hospital. That has a significant impact on the delivery of health care. Very quickly, we would like to have $600,000 to do MIS upgrades or information management upgrades, as well as we seek $3,800,000 in addition to the MIS for many of the facilities that NEON operates. The facilities are old, and they are in need of renovation to be able to continue to provide care. I thank my colleagues and the Women's Caucus for giving me the opportunity to be heard today. I would ask this committee to keep in mind the desperate need of community health centers in our Nation and the need for them to provide care. I submit my testimony for the record. Also, let me not forget, there--I should say that, incidently, Mr. Chairman, you may also know that there is a center comparable in your community in Massillon. Mr. Regula. I am very aware of it. They reminded me several times. [The information follows:] [GRAPHIC(S) NOT AVAILABLE IN TIFF FORMAT] Tuesday, April 3, 2001. VARIOUS PROGRAMS WITNESS HON. CONNIE MORELLA, A REPRESENTATIVE IN CONGRESS FROM THE STATE OF MARYLAND Mr. Regula. I think what we will do is do the panel and then questions, because we have a pretty full schedule here to get through today. So, Connie, you are next. Mrs. Morella. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. I want to begin by congratulating you on the chairmanship of what I consider one of the most important subcommittees of the Appropriations Committee and thank you for extending to us this opportunity to testify before you. And, Ms. DeLauro, I am wearing my red for Equal Pay Day. Mr. Regula. Isn't there equal pay in the Congress? Mrs. Morella. Well, it is--actually, I would say it is one of the few places where we are pretty close to equal pay, but in so many other areas that is not the case. Among my top priorities is the continuation of our commitment to double the budget for the National Institutes of Health, and we are on the right track. We are in year number 4 of the 5-year plan. The President has called for $23,100,000,000, which is a 13.8 percent increase. To keep on track, we could use $23,700,000,000. Let me jump around to a couple of other issues that are important to all of us and indeed to me. Since 1990, I have been the sponsor of legislation to address women and AIDS issues. Women are the fastest-growing group of people with HIV, with low-income women and women of color being hit the hardest by the epidemic. AIDS is the leading cause of death in young African American women. We particularly urge your support for the development of a microbicide to prevent the transmission of HIV and sexually transmitted diseases at a level of $75,000,000. Currently, less than 1 percent of the budget for HIV and AIDS-related research at the National Institutes of Health is being spent on microbicide research. Actually, I would like to see the important work of the Office of AIDS Research quickly converted into a proactive, strategic plan for microbicide research and development that has the active involvement and support of NIH and institute leadership. Much progress has been made, but more needs to be done. You know, microbicides, I remember many years ago when I first introduced legislation I couldn't pronounce microbicide, but it is so critically important to making sure that we don't have HIV and AIDS and sexually transmitted diseases. It is like a vaginal solution that has nothing to do with a spermicide, so it is not a birth control method; and, boy, what a difference this would make in the world. I would like to jump to breast cancer. Mr. Chairman, as you know, women continue to face a one in eight chance of developing breast cancer during their lifetime. More than 2,600,000 women are currently living with breast cancer. This year alone more than 183,000 women will be diagnosed with breast cancer, and 41,000 women will die of the disease. This subcommittee has clearly demonstrated its commitment to breast cancer research. We urge you to continue this momentum in this fiscal year 2002. On behalf of all the women who live in fear of the disease, we urge the subcommittee to continue its strong commitment. And, Mr. Chairman, although it is not a widely known fact, tuberculosis is the biggest infectious killer of young women in the world. In fact, TB kills more women worldwide than all other causes of maternal mortality combined. Currently, an estimated one-third of the world's population, including 15 million people in the United States, are infected with the TB bacteria; and due to its infectious nature TB can't be stopped at national borders. So it is important to control TB in the United States, and it is impossible to control it until we control it worldwide. I urge support for an annual investment of $528,000,000 for the Centers for Disease Control in its efforts to eliminate TB. Of course, there is that multiple- drug-resistent strain of TB that is so dangerous. The Violence Against Women Act is a very important priority. We reauthorized it, added some new programs. Now I respectfully request that the funding become a priority for this subcommittee; and I am requesting that the shelters under the FVPSA, which is the Family Violence Prevention Act, be funded at their authorized level of $175,000,000 for fiscal year 2002. Also, transitional housing that Asa Hutchinson and Bill McCollum helped to put into that bill, the transitional housing program to be funded at its original and one-time authorization level of $25,000,000. Rape prevention and education to be funded at its full authorization level of $80,000,000 for fiscal year 2002. Several other programs I have mentioned in the testimony that I am submitting but are, very briefly, the Women in Apprenticeships and Nontraditional Employment Act, I introduced that many years ago, it has been working well on $1,000,000, to continue it. The Campus-Based Child Care Program, which is working to allow low-income women to have some assistance with child care on college campuses. What a great way to get them off of welfare and into the work world. That being said, you are very kind and gracious, you and the members of this subcommittee, Mr. Sherwood, and I see Ms. Pelosi is here. We had Ms. Lowey, Ms. DeLauro and Mr. Kennedy listening to us and hope that you will be able to accommodate these. [The information follows:] [GRAPHIC(S) NOT AVAILABLE IN TIFF FORMAT] Tuesday, April 3, 2001. PREVENTION OF DOMESTIC VIOLENCE WITNESS HON. SHELLEY BERKLEY, A REPRESENTATIVE IN CONGRESS FROM THE STATE OF NEVADA Mr. Regula. Could you all stay when you finish the panel? Then we will take the questions. Because we are on a pretty tight schedule to get through all the other witnesses. Ms. Berkley. Ms. Berkley. I am delighted to have an opportunity to testify before this subcommittee which enjoys a wonderful reputation for tackling issues of major importance to women and children and families in our Nation and has been instrumental in improving the quality of life for millions of American families that, prior to your interest and actions, had little hope for their futures or the futures of their children. I want to thank you for allowing me to speak today in support of increased funding for programs to prevent domestic violence. Crimes of domestic violence have devastating consequences for women personally, as well as for their families and for society as a whole. In my district of southern Nevada, I have visited shelters for battered women and talked with law enforcement officers, counselors and community leaders. I had an opportunity to do a drive-along with the police when they were doing their domestic violence shift, and I have seen firsthand the horrible effects domestic violence can have on a community. That is why today I ask you to continue efforts to prevent domestic violence by fully funding domestic violence grant programs within the Department of Health and Human Services. These programs, which include grants for rape prevention and education, community intervention and prevention organizations, as well as the National Domestic Violence Hotline, are vital to the fight against domestic violence. Of particular importance, however, is funding that supports shelters for battered women. These shelters are often the only source of protection and relief for women who are fleeing from a violent situation. Women across the country need the services that domestic violence programs provide; and, again, I urge you to fully fund these programs. I have had an opportunity to tour all of the domestic crisis shelters in southern Nevada in my district, from the ones where people are going just for a very temporary 24-hour situation to get them out of their house, get their children out of the house, to the more complex situations where, when I went to visit the shelters, they blindfolded me and drove me there because these are places that are so secret that the perpetrator of the violence cannot find his family and continue to perpetuate the crime against his family. Most of these women, when I sit down and speak to them, they tell me how desperate they are to have a place to go not only for themselves but particularly for their children. Many women are stuck in a violent situation because theydon't have anyplace to go, and they endure incredible violence in their homes because they are afraid to be without an income, without a roof over their heads, without shelter for their children. If we can provide this tool for them to get out of those situations, they can break this dependency and codependency that they have on the perpetrator of the violence and begin to get the counseling they need and break out of the situation and be able to take care of not only themselves but their children as well. Many times, it is just a shelter to house them until they can get on their feet. But if we don't provide this they will end up back in the abusive situation. When I was practicing law I spent a good deal of my pro bono time trying to help these women get out of the situation, provide them with low-cost divorces. But it wasn't--it was the dependency, it was the emotional damage, it was the psychological fear that they had of breaking that tie and getting out of their home and feeling that without that home they would be destitute and on the streets. And for many of these women they endure incredible pain and incredible violence just so their children aren't out in the streets. Again, I want to thank you very much, but unless we fully fund these domestic crisis shelters we are going to have this problem in perpetuity; and the cost to society is far more extensive if we don't spend the money to fully fund these shelters and these programs than if we don't. Mr. Regula. Thank you. Are you familiar with Parents Anonymous? It is--at least in Ohio they are pretty active where they--it is like single mothers can go and talk to each other and get help. It is a support group and somewhat goes to what you are discussing here. Ms. Berkley. There are many programs available, but in the final analysis, if the women has to go back to that violent environment, she is never going to break the cycle. Mr. Regula. Very true. [The information follows:] [GRAPHIC(S) NOT AVAILABLE IN TIFF FORMAT] Mr. Kennedy. Mr. Chairman, these grants also help us identify those children, because the National Institutes of Mental Health have developed an absolute correlation between children from families with domestic violence and drug abuse, cognitive delay in learning and further violence within the family among these children. This is absolutely a determinative in terms of the cycle of violence. So these grants have another effect of allowing us to try to address the needs of these children along with their mothers in many cases. So I look forward to working with you on making sure that we get some training for these kids, too, when they face these situations. A couple of States have done very well by these grants to get the whole families involved. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. Mr. Regula. Mr. Sherwood. Mr. Sherwood. Well, the testimony is very compelling; and we have all in our private lives seen examples. If there is anything that we can do, such as these grants, to put that behind us, we are certainly on the right track. Thank you. Mr. Regula. Ms. Pelosi. Ms. Pelosi. Mr. Chairman, while I was listening to the very excellent testimony of Representative Berkley, especially toward the end when she was talking about her own experience doing pro bono work, I was reminded of our work together when we were on Commerce, Justice, State together. We were able to-- I had worked with Senator Cohen, others in the Senate and this--not Senator Cohen, others in the Senate on the Republican side where we tried to make--for women to have legal assistance. They were testing the income of the spouse. So we had an amendment in our Commerce, Justice bill for legal assistance that would say that the income of the spouse would not be counted against the woman when she tried to get some legal assistance, some legal aid. Which made a very--as you well know, you graciously did pro bono work, but everyone is not able to avail themselves of that. So that made it a difference, too. But this has been a fight for a while in the Congress to get as much as possible for these grants. It is one of the proudest moments that we have, when the Women's Caucus comes before us with this array of issues that are so important; and we have been able to make a substantial difference in many areas of health, Mr. Chairman. Everybody understands that this is a tricky issue, because everyone is uncomfortable with it and all the more reason we have the maximum resources to do it. So I am glad the Women's Caucus has made this a priority. Mr. Regula. As you pointed out, you and I have been champions of legal services in Commerce, State because that is one way that women can get help that otherwise just wouldn't be available. Tuesday, April 3, 2001. COMMUNITY HEALTH CENTERS WITNESS HON. LORETTA SANCHEZ, A REPRESENTATIVE IN CONGRESS FROM THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA Mr. Regula. Mrs. Sanchez. Ms. Sanchez. Thank you, Mr. Chairman, and congratulations on your chairmanship. Thank you to the entire subcommittee for allowing us to come before you to testify today. I would lend my voice to many of the issues that--probably all of the issues that these women are going to talk to today, but in particular I want to take a couple of minutes to talk about increasing the funding for community health centers. We would like to see an increase in the amount of $250,000,000. I will tell you, it is some of best money that we can spend, because this directly affects areas that are usually low income, as parts of my district are. It is about putting health care readily accessible to people there, because they either don't have transportation or they do not have an ability to get off work or they have children they have got to take care of or they have to bring the children with them. What happens when you don't have community health clinics is that people don't go and see a doctor. When they do go and see the doctor, it is with a very chronic problem already when they walk through the front door. Where is it that they go? They don't go to a clinic. They go to an emergency hospital where they know it is the highest cost of delivery in the entire health care system. So when we are able to put these community clinics in areas where people can come, they can come with their kids, they can walk, they are readily available, they are open on Saturdays and Sundays, and they can get preventative medicine. They can work on issues of nutrition for diabetes, for example, where the Latino community has about five times the amount of diabetes in our community than anybody else in the United States, and that is simply because of nutrition. There are problems that we have that become very expensive if we don't get access to health in a meaningful way to people in lower income areas. One of the things that has happened in my district and why I feel so strongly about this is that we are now seeing what we call back room clinics in pharmacies. So if you go to an independent pharmacy or you go to a drugstore that doesn't even have a pharmacy there in my area and you need something, you need medication for your kid, your kid is sick, what is happening is that these people are taking them into the back room, somebody who is not even a doctor is analyzing what is wrong with this kid and giving them drugs that are either coming in, brought across the border from Mexico--and we have had, just in the last 6 months, an 18-month-old baby girl and a 15-year-old boy die because of illegal drugs, prescription drugs coming from someplace else being given to these kids. And these parents are--this is the kind of health care that they think they can afford. So the more that we can do to put in neighborhood clinics the better it will be for all of us in the long run. We don't need to lose these kids simply because parents are doing the best that they think they can do in a system that is pretty much ignoring them. And I am talking about working people. I am talking about people who have taxes taken out of their paychecks. I am talking about people who pay taxes when they go and they buy everything at the store. These are people who are low income and need the access to health care. So I would hope that you would really consider increasing the amount towards the community health care centers. Mr. Regula. Thank you. Any questions? [The information follows:] [GRAPHIC(S) NOT AVAILABLE IN TIFF FORMAT] Tuesday, April 3, 2001. TRANSITIONAL HOUSING WITNESS HON. JANICE D. SCHAKOWSKY, A REPRESENTATIVE IN CONGRESS FROM THE STATE OF ILLINOIS Mr. Regula. Our next witness is Mrs. Schakowsky, the successor to my great friend, Sid Yates. Ms. Schakowsky. As I was going to say, Mr. Chairman, though you and I don't know each other very well, I feel very warmly toward you because of the great relationship that you had and the things Sid Yates said about you, so thank you very much. Mr. Regula. I still miss him. He used to call me after I was gone to tell me how to run the committee. Ms. Schakowsky. Well, I wanted to also talk about violence against women and the needs for transitional housing, and I am so glad that Connie Morella spoke to you about it. Shelly Berkeley talked about the need for shelters. I wanted to particularly emphasize the $25,000,000 for transitional housing that was authorized in the Victims of Trafficking and Violence Protection Act of 2000. So I am hoping that that money now can be appropriated. The Department of Justice has identified 960,000 women annually who report having been abused by their husbands and boyfriends, but we know that number is really just the tip of the iceberg. The first comprehensive national health survey of American women conducted by the Commonwealth Foundation says that 3.9 million American women actually experience abuse by an intimate partner each year, 3.9 million. Hundreds of these women, hopefully thousands, are able to get out of those situations, but they have few financial resources and often have no place to go. Lack of affordable housing and long waiting lists for assisted housing mean that many women and their children are forced to choose between abuse at home or on the streets. While we absolutely need more money for shelters because they are filled to capacity right now, we know that, in fact, 50 percent of homeless women and children--that is, 50 percent of the families, the women and children who are homeless right now are fleeing abuse. So the connection between housing and abuse is overwhelming. Housing can prevent domestic violence and mitigate its effects. Shelters provide immediate safety to battered women and their children and help women gain control over their lives and get on their feet. A stable, sustainable home base is crucial for women who have left a situation of domestic violence. While dealing with the trauma of abuse, they are also learning new job skills, participating in educational programs, working full-time jobs or searching for adequate child care in order to gain receive sufficiency. Transitional housing resources and services provide a continuum between those first emergency shelters and independent living and so those transitional housing dollars are very important. According to estimates by the McAuley Institute, $25,000,000 in funding for transitional housing would provide assistance to at least 2,700 families. We must be supportive of individuals who are escaping violence and seeking to better their lives. In closing, let me reiterate my appreciation to the subcommittee and restate my strong support for providing safe transitional housing assistance to women and children fleeing domestic violence. Thank you. Let me just, on a personal note, mention that my last visit to this committee last year I was sitting next to Loretta Sanchez. Actually, it was sort of depressing because she was talking about being in the first Head Start class and how important it was, and I was there to talk about being the first--teaching the first Head Start class. I thought, oh, my word, the difference here. But I am so happy that so many of us are here today talking about domestic violence and the importance of providing the support for women seeking to flee that. [The information follows:] [GRAPHIC(S) NOT AVAILABLE IN TIFF FORMAT] Mr. Regula. We hope that in Head Start we can maybe improve on it and make it a little more of an educational experience, rather than just warehousing of kids. That tends to be the characteristic of it, and I think you will miss a great opportunity in Head Start to not do more on the education side of it. I have never figured out quite why it was in the welfare department and not in the education department. Ms. Schakowsky. Head Start has been a wonderfully successful program. Mr. Kennedy. Mr. Chairman, on the Head Start, the thing that the teachers say is most important is the social and emotional development of the child. That is what gives them the cognitive advantage over those kids that haven't gone through Head Start. So it is not so much that they are learning their ABCs, but they are in an environment that starts to make it conducive to learning down the road. So it is kind of an interesting thing. But it is not the cognitive development so much at Head Start, which is what we think it is, but it is the social and emotional development, which I might add is lacking in our other primary education, which we need to work on. Ms. Schakowsky. I agree. I didn't want to step on my own message, though. I wanted to be sure that I am focusing here on the $25,000,000 for the transitional housing. Mr. Regula. This committee has a broad jurisdiction. Any other questions? Thank you very much. ---------- Tuesday, April 3, 2001. ENFORCEMENT OF WORK PLACE PROTECTIONS WITNESS HON. HILDA SOLIS, A REPRESENTATIVE IN CONGRESS FROM THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA Mr. Regula. Mrs. Solis. Ms. Solis. Thank you, Mr. Chairman and members. It is a pleasure to be here for the first time to speak before your subcommittee; and I want to add my comments also, along with those that have been made by previous members, regarding health care research and the whole issue of domestic violence. Just as kind of a footnote there, in my own district I was successful in getting one shelter established in Los Angeles County in the area that I represented. It is a really sad situation when you think about all the animal shelters that exist in my district. When you put a price at where you value human life and what have you, we only were able to get funding for one shelter. So much more is sorely needed. I would hope that this committee would strongly take a good look at how we can enhance partnerships, both public and private, with law enforcement, so we can have both permanent shelters for those and transitional. Our problem in our district is that we have many women who are faced with this issue of domestic violence, and with that bring their children. In cases for Latinos, for example, you are talking about 4 or 5 siblings, children that come along with that one woman, who is looking for a place to go and possibly a warm meal, a roof over her head, but also the opportunity to find employment. So I would hope that this will be a priority for this coming session. But my remarks, I would like to focus in on the issue of enforcement of Federal wage and overtime laws by the Department of Labor. As you go through in crafting the Labor-HHS funding budget for fiscal year 2002, I would like to urge the committee to allocate sufficient funds for the enforcement of workplace protections. This issue is very critically important to women, not just in my district, but in many corners of our country, particularly in those areas where you find an enormous number of low skilled workers, women in particular, who are working, as an example, in the garment industry. My district has a very high proportion of individuals who work in the garment industry. Unfortunately, a few years ago it was discovered there was a sweatshop in the City of El Monte, which I happen to represent. There were 72 women, Thai women, that were held hostage there, many for 7 years. They did not mention though, however, in those news articles, there were many Latino women also working there day in and day out and were forced to work under very harsh conditions and were not given minimum wage, were not given overtime, were actually placed in a warehouse setting where they were pretty much locked in and could not leave the compound as it was later viewed by the public. I would hope that we could do as much as we can to help to provide information to the workforce, but particularly women that tend to be attracted to this particular type of industry, because it is a problem, not only in California, but along the border and other parts of the country, where I believe we need to do more to provide those protections for women and their children, because we also know there are many children working in it these factories as well. Because of a lack of resources in the past few years and also on the part of our local municipalities that may not have enough funding to follow through on code enforcement to really go through and find out if, for example, a true small business is actually working legitimately and that they are paying for their licenses and what have you. We are finding there has been a cutback in these areas, and obviously that leads to more abuse. So I would hope that this committee would take a strong look at protecting the rights of women in the workplace as we work towards pay equity. We also have to work towards a place, an environment, where they can work and be treated with dignity, and that they are fully aware of their rights when they are at the workplace, and that the employer also plays a meaningful role in providing that kind of information as well. This year we are going to be working on trying to elevate the minimum wage. In the State of California, we happen to have a higher minimum wage than here at the Federal level, and I hope we can work in partnership to bring some equity. That isn't to say where I would like to see it. I would like to see it much more higher, but at least it is a start. I would hope we can venture into those discussions. I would like to thank you for the opportunity to speak to you today. Mr. Regula. Thank you. We will bring this issue up with Mrs. Chao when she testifies, because it would be her department responsibility. Questions. Ms. Pelosi. No questions.

NAPOLITANO, A MEMBER OF CONGRESS FROM THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA Mr. Regula. Thank you very much. Our next witness is Mrs. Napolitano. Am I saying it right? Ms. Napolitano. You are very right on, sir. Good morning, and thank you so much for the opportunity you have given the Women's Caucus to come before you and bring the issues that all of us feel are important. I associate myself with the remarks at every turn. One of the reasons, Mr. Chairman and members, that I am here, is because there is an issue that has been identified in the last 2 years dealing with youth mental health crisis in this country. Recent incidents in school shootings only add more urgency to that particular matter, and that is the reason why I am here, again, to respectfully request you continue support for the school-based Latino mental health services program in my an area. It is a pilot we begun. Let me provide some disturbing facts that illustrate, and I am sure you heard them before, but I just need to get them to you again, the depth of the crisis for young Latinos in the country. Today, nearly one in three Latino adolescents has seriously considered suicide. This is the highest rate for any racial or ethnic group in the whole country. Additionally, they also lead their peers in the rates of alcohol and drug abuse, teen pregnancy, and self-reported gun handling. These statistics are all more alarming when one considers that fewer prevention and treatment services reach young Latinos than any other racial or ethnic group. This is a report that came to us in 1999 with the state of Hispanic girls through the National Alliance for Hispanic Health, a conglomerate of groups that provide mental health services for Latino groups. This is in spite of the fact that Hispanic girls now represent the largest minority of girls in the country, and are expected to remain so for the next 50 years. Last year this subcommittee gratefully took a major and laudable step when it directed SAMHSA to provide $680,000 through the programs of national and regional significance activity, center for the mental health services, to begin addressing the mental health need of Latino adolescents through innovative school-based mental health services in our area. What we have done is we have taken the nonprofit mental health care provider and all other mental health advisers and have gone to the schools, setting the program actually in three middle schools and a high school, to give the direct services. The funding does not go to the State, does not go to the county, but goes directly to the providers and the schools where the most need is. Now I am asking, I am urging and I am begging the subcommittee to give this fledgling pilot program an opportunity to make a difference in the lives of these young women and many others. School administrators, teachers, community mental health providers, and parents, and, most importantly, young Latinos believe this program is urgently needed. This subcommittee and Congress has begun to provide national leadership in dealing with this crisis and in finding appropriate solutions. Our aim as a society should be to help these young girls reach their true potential and allow them to make positive contributions to their communities, to their State and to their Nation. Failure to do so may condemn a generation of young girls to lives that are significantly less hopeful and productive than they deserve. Again, I respectfully request the subcommittee to continue providing this program at the same level of funding as last year, and hopefully this program will provide a way for duplication throughout other areas where it may be so desperately needed at this point. Thank you again for the consideration, and look forward to answering any questions you may have. Mr. Regula. Thank you. Questions. Mr. Kennedy. Yes, Mr. Chairman. I applaud you for your work on this. I have been working with the chairman to address this issue. Would you kind of explain further how the schools end up being a non-stigma environment so the kids can get the help in the schools, rather than in some mental health counseling outside, which would certainly be so loaded with stigma, and of course explain the culture, the Latino culture, so that it really oppresses people with this mental health issue. We think we have got a stigma. Imagine what it is for the Latino culture. Ms. Napolitano. It is a tremendously important area to be able to provide the service in the school itself. Understanding that my Latino friends and relatives and my peers and everybody else, they consider it an area that you don't go. You don't talk about it, you don't bring it up. Especially in the male Latino, you just don't admit that you have a mental problem. The stigma is they don't know the difference between a mental health issue and a mental disease issue. Part of what has happened in our society, and the Latino society specifically, is this has carried on to the family, you are not allowed to admit you have a mental problem or a mental health issue that can be dealt with, that you can talk out. So the idea is to have it in the schools where the peer pressure is. These teachers can be a part of it. The parents will be a part of it. This is not just a school thatis going to be involved. It is a whole community effort by bringing all the players in at the school to deal with the issue. The classrooms are going to be set up so that they can go to specific rooms to deal with it, and there will be classes given to others that do not have the same problem of dealing with mental health issues, but rather to understand that it is not a stigma, but rather an idea for them to identify, in their own mind, how they can deal with pressures and those kind of issues. Mr. Kennedy. Thank you very much. Mr. Regula. Mr. Sherwood. Mr. Sherwood. Thank you very much. Ms. Napolitano. Thank you.

SHEILA JACKSON-LEE, A REPRESENTATIVE IN CONGRESS FROM THE STATE OF TEXAS Mr. Regula. Okay. Ms. Jackson-Lee. Ms. Jackson-Lee. Thank you very much, Mr. Chairman. It is nice to see you, and thank all the members for being here on a Tuesday morning. Might I associate myself with all of my fellow colleagues from the Women's Caucus and their different issues. Might I particularly associate myself with my colleague sitting next to me on the issue of mental health. I have offered, over the last two sessions, the Omnibus Give a Kid a Chance Mental Health Bill, that deals with providing more resources for children that are dealing with mental health concerns. I would like to give you what you may already know very quickly, and then focus in particular on the concerns that I have. Mr. Chairman, I think you may be aware that 13.7 million children in this country have diagnosable mental health disorder, yet less than 20 percent of them receive treatment. The White House and U.S. Surgeon General have recognized mental health needs to be a national priority in this Nation's debate about comprehensive health care. I have found that at least 1 in 5 children, adolescents, have a diagnosable mental, emotional or behavorial problem that may lead to school failure, substance abuse, violence or suicide. However, 75 to 80 percent of these children do not receive the services. According to a 1999 report of the U.S. Surgeon General for young people 15 to 24 years old, suicide is the third leading cause of death behind intentional injury and homicide. In particular, in the African American community, the U.S. Surgeon General has found that the rate of suicides among African American youth has increased 100 percent in the last decade. Black male youth, ages 10 to 14, have shown the largest increase in suicide rates since 1980 compared to other youth groups by sex and ethnicity, increasing 276 percent. Almost 12 young people between the ages of 15 and 24 die every day by suicide. When we speak about another selective group in the study of gay male and lesbian youth suicide, the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services found lesbian and gay youth are two to six times more likely to attempt suicide than other youth and account for up to 30 percent of all completed teen suicides. I interact with such a group, family group, in Houston, working with these young people in particular, trying to make adults available to be engaged in their lives. You see it firsthand because, as my colleague said, they are intimidated, they don't know where to turn for information. They are different, whether they are Latino, whether they are African American, whether they are different by way of a lifestyle, whether they are different by way of their particular religious background. Mr. Regula. Do you think they recognize that they have a need? Ms. Jackson-Lee. No, Mr. Chairman. I think, as my colleague has said, sometimes it is culturally different, sometimes there is a cultural difference. If I take my community, the African American community, very heavily based in religious beliefs, it is well-known that you are directed toward your Savior, and, if you are not grounded in that, then you are not directed anywhere. It is a stigma in the community, and I would argue, not having firsthand experience to the gay and lesbian teenager, but as I have been told by groups that advocate for them, they particularly are isolated because they are different. So I think what it is is that I don't know what I have, I am confused, but no one will understand me. So I think that this whole concept of having services, whether it is in the schools, which I support, whether it is in community-based health clinics, which I support, because I want parents to be able to feel free who are not able to access the private sector for psychiatric or counseling service, to have the access to do this. This is not a conversation about guns, Mr. Chairman. I know it is well known, my position, but I think over the last 48 hours, we have saw some studies that were shocking aboutteenage boys being able to have access to guns or bring guns to school. So we know that our children suffer from gun violence. Handgun Control reports that in 1996, more than 1,300 children, aged 10 to 19, committed suicide with firearms. What I would like to get at is the intervening act factor, to be able to help these young people before they get to that point. With the high number of uninsured young people, Texas has the second highest rate of uninsured children in the Nation with over 25 percent, there are programs that you support that I would like to ask for increased support. The National Mental Health Association has a children's mental health services program that provides grants to public entities for comprehensive community-based mental health services for children with serious emotional disturbances. These grants go to direct services that include diagnostic, evaluation services, outpatient services at schools, at home, and in the clinic, and day treatment. I would like to see that funded and provided additional funding. In addition, I would like to see parity for alcohol and drug addiction treatment for young people and their families. I emphasize their families, Mr. Chairman. I think that is an excellent combination, because many times the adults in the home, whoever is the supervising adult, a grandmother maybe, are as much in need of service as might be the child. I met with these individuals through the National Mental Health Association, and I had grandmothers raising 15-year-olds who already had a child and already tried to attempt to commit suicide 2 or 3 times, a little girl 15 years old. And to see the grandmother who was not that old to have to confront the needs of this 15-year-old, they both needed to be in counseling. The Children Mental Services Health Program only serves now 34,000 children, so I ask the committee to authorize $93 million for that. The Safe Schools Health Student Initiative is another program of the Children's Mental Health Services Program, and I would ask for $78 million involved in that program. Quickly, Mr. Chairman, I want to move from mental health and focus briefly only on children as victims of HIV-AIDS. I know this may have been previously discussed. I support a particular community organization called the Donald R. Watkins Memorial Fund, which has seen its dollars cut drastically. It is estimated that 800,000 to 900,000 Americans are living with HIV and every year another 40,000 become infected. I happen to come from a community in Houston that at the time of the issuance or the establishment of the Ryan White treatment dollars, we were 13th in the Nation of HIV infected. That was about 1991-92. My particular community has not decreased as much as we would like, and we find a large number of our young people infected with HIV-AIDS. In fact, we find a large number of African American's infected, and particularly children. So I would ask to receive a total additional amount, I believe this is $4 million during FY 2000, and even more during FY 2001. Let me get this amount into the record. I am asking for an increase for $89 million for Title I, $45 million for Title II, $46 for Title III, $19 million for Title IV, so Houston will receive additional funds, as well as the Nation, and I am particularly asking for direct grants for Donald R. White Memorial Foundation for $500,000 for their special services dealing with children and young people. I will conclude, because my statistics may be a little long, to simply say that Andy Williams in California, Columbine, we can all talk about guns, we can talk about taking guns away from children, but these children are disturbed. And as I followed this, I had a hearing in my district with Senator Wellstone. It is amazing. First of all, what we do is we put most of them in a juvenile justice system, because we don't have any place to put them. The parents don't know what to do. The parents don't intervene soon enough. If we had just known, or Andy Williams had somewhere to go to talk about this bullying or maybe talk to the children about character issues. And I think mental health, if we can destigmatize it and ensure that children feel free--it is just like coming to a counselor or going to Burger King or McDonald's, to be able to express your feelings, we might not have all of these painful situations that are happening in our community. I am with these children, I talk to the gay and lesbian youth, it is really an emotional situation when you speak to them. No one cares about them. I just think we can do better. I know how we are fighting, when I say fighting, I know the difficulty of appropriators. I appreciate all of you very much. But this has gotten to be a crisis in our Nation, not taking care of our children who are disturbed and resulting in adults who are dysfunctional. So I would appreciate very much your indulgence. I conclude by simply saying I had an amendment on underserved populations in the last Congress, and this is what this is all about, many underserved populations, because they are not getting some of the services that they need. Mr. Regula. I think you are suggesting that there ought to be counselors available somewhere for this disturbed youth to go. Ms. Jackson-Lee. Somewhere, and it can be either theschool- based efforts, that I support enthusiastically, and then there are these community-based mental health clinics that, because they are in the community, they can be called any manner of names. Whether they have to be called mental health clinics, they become familiar. The National Mental Health Association has interfaced with this structure, where they put them in the community and the parent, the guardian, whoever it is, can go with the child, and it may be down the block, or it may be just a few blocks away, or maybe connected to the school, or it may be connected to some community-based group. But what it does is it allows the families to come without stigma and also not go very far away. When you hear the word ``psychiatrist'' or do you have to go to a doctor's office, these are community-based entities that may be helpful. I think they are in only 34 States right now. Mr. Regula. Could they be part of the community health centers? We have had testimony here about the importance of those. Ms. Jackson-Lee. That is part of the effort of the National Mental Health Association. We would like to see more funding so they could be in more states. [The information follows:] [GRAPHIC(S) NOT AVAILABLE IN TIFF FORMAT] Mr. Regula. Mr. Kennedy. Mr. Kennedy. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. This is not social science; this is not soft science. We have the Surgeon General just come out with his report on children's mental health. This is part of the health. The brain is like any other organ. It is like diabetes, asthma, it is a chronic illness, it needs to be treated regularly. We have one in five children, according to the Surgeon General's report and as Ms. Jackson-Lee pointed out, who have severe emotional mental illness, and the schools are one of the primary places to capture them, because that is obviously a non-stigma environment. In addition to that, as Ms. Jackson-Lee pointed out, the community health centers are good places. But what we also need to do is train the primary care physicians to identify depression and mental illness. You would be surprised how many regular primary care general physicians do not know how to identify this, and therefore it goes undetected. You also, being a member of Commerce-Justice-State, the Office of Juvenile Justice and Deliquency Prevention, the juvenile crime rate is going up. What is the surprise? We know through sociological studies that parents are spending one-third less time with children today than they did just a couple of decades ago. If you don't think that comes with a price, when you have two parents working or it is a single-parent family, where that child doesn't see the parent until the end of the night and the child has to be put to bed, this is a significant cost to our society. We need to bring the families together somehow, and hopefully these kinds of programs will help do it. I just wanted to pass that along. Mr. Regula. Mr. Sherwood. Mr. Sherwood. Thank you very much. Mr. Regula. Mrs. Pelosi. Ms. Pelosi. Mr. Chairman, I just want to associate myself with Mr. Kennedy's remarks. We have to have parity in terms of mental health and what other people call other health issues. I particularly want to commend both of our witnesses for their focus on the School-Based Mental Health Initiative, and also Congresswoman's Jackson-Lee's testimony about HIV-AIDS, and I want to say that thanks to both of our witnesses and many women here this morning, we were able to send a letter to President Bush on March 29 signed by 153 members in a bipartisan fashion to talk about the AIDS epidemic. I think that at some point we will have the opportunity to meet with the President on this subject, and the subject of young people and HIV-AIDS, which is certainly an important component of it. We are optimistic we can meet with the President. Good work on these issues. Mr. Chairman, the testimony that people bring in for a few minutes is important to us. This is like the tippy-tippy-tip of the iceberg of the work that they do in that regard. Thanks to both of you. Mr. Regula. I would be curious, since the Secretary of Education is from your town, did you have anything in the school system there, any counseling, that would be accessible to students in a disturbed state? Ms. Jackson-Lee. We were beginning to make some progress on school-based health clinics. In those health clinics we had individuals who could stand in for counselors. When I say that, nurses who were trained, et cetera, they could go right in the school. They are slowly but surely--in fact, we argued in the present legislative session in Texas for more funding for school-based clinics. But we, too, I would say the Secretary of Education is very open to this, but we too need more growth in those areas. I will also I guess acknowledge that we have been--I will knock on some wood here-- fairly fortunate in Houston, but again, I don't take any special pride, because violence breaks out anywhere and everywhere. So it is just that it is something that we need to make great strides on. Might I just say on the hearing that I had in Houston, the juvenile justice officials came forward and noted whatCongressman Pelosi noted and Congressman Kennedy noted, is that we don't know what to do with these children. They said you are sending them to us because we are the only physical plant they can be housed. You would think they would say bring them on or we are prepared to do it, but they were the ones pleading with us, find us more mental health services because you are sending us children who we can't treat, we can only house them. Mr. Kennedy. Mr. Chairman, if I could, these kids who end up in our juvenile justice system, you have 95 percent or higher that come from abusive homes. This is, like, the correlation is too great. We know which kids are high risk. We ought to intervene earlier. These kids, by the time they end up in the juvenile justice system, the parents know, the teachers know, the schools know, for us to let them slip through its cracks itself is criminal. On the Elementary and Secondary Education Act with the Education Secretary, this might be a good issue for us to try to include somewhere in the Elementary and Secondary Education Act, because it is so fundamental to the child's education. Mr. Regula. We will have an opportunity when the Secretary of Education is before us to talk about that, and probably one of the things that teacher education should include is some course or so that would, because the teacher would be a very good person to identify disturbed children early. Ms. Napolitano. They are with them a major portion of the time, and they can tell when the student is beginning to act up or the grades are beginning to fall. Mr. Chairman, I have a mental health hospital in my area and have been involved for many years at the adult level. We have also different clinics from the Mental Health Association that I have been involved with through the years. They deal with really mostly the disease more than the illness. I think it is time we began to add substance to the local provision of services by giving some assistance to the families, as my colleague was saying, for mental health services. What we are attempting to do is begin to show that the partnership between the county and the State, adding additional services, maybe not even in funding, but services, whether it is personnel or whether it is a locale, so that we can expand on the delivery of the service at the local level. You are right. The correlation of the children, the neglected one, the at-risk kids, all has a bearing, and we all know those areas. So if we can target the areas and begin to work with the community to be able to deal with the child, we will be successful. That is what I am attempting to do, along with my colleague. Mr. Regula. Thank you both for coming. It is a significant problem you have identified. We will do what we can. Ms. Jackson-Lee. Mr. Chairman, may I ask a procedural question on the time that members have to have requests in? Mr. Regula. The 27th of April. Ms. Jackson-Lee. It has not passed. Someone had given me a date that caused migraine indigestion. Mr. Regula. My experience in Interior is some requests may not be timely, but they still get to the chairman. Ms. Jackson-Lee. I am trying to meet your rules and regulations. So you are saying April 27th? Mr. Regula. That is correct. Ms. Jackson-Lee. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. ---------- Tuesday, April 3, 2001. RE: PROJECTS WITNESSES HON. BRAD SHERMAN, A REPRESENTATIVE IN CONGRESS FROM THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA Mr. Regula. Mr. Sherman. Mr. Sherman. Mr. Chairman, it is interesting to appear before you in a new capacity. I want to thank the members of the subcommittee for being here. I have had a number of projects in my district that I think will interest the subcommittee. The first--I guess it works better when you turn the microphone on. The first is a request for $500,000 to help build the new Guadalupe Community Center in the poorest part of my district. It is a program run by Catholic Charities of Los Angeles. The building program will cost $1.5 million. Private charities will come through with one-third of that amount, the City of Los Angeles roughly a third, and I am asking the Federal Government to provide the final third. The center serves 900,000 individuals from low income families, 84 percent of its clients are Hispanic. It provides emergency food, clothing, case management, senior nutrition, welfare to work services, a youth mentoring program. Due to immigration, there is a substantial additional need. The center needs to expand so it can provide English as a second language and computer and math skills. That is the first project on my list, is a request for half a million dollars for the Guadalupe center. The next two projects are so important that I am bringingthem to the subcommittee's attention, even though 80 percent of the project is outside my district. The projects will take place primarily in Elton Gallegly's district. He and I share Ventura County. He can't be here today. He is counting on my eloquence to explain the programs. The first is a preventive health care program for the people of Ventura County. This is an outreach program to provide preventative health so we don't have people showing up at emergency rooms. The county has had a drop of roughly 20,000 people in the number who are in Medicaid, but then there has been a 20,000 increase in the number who were on Medicaid and now have no insurance at all. This is an innovative program to provide cost-effective preventive medical services. Some $9 million is being provided by the county, and we need $5 million of Federal funds, slightly more than a third, Federal funds for this program. The next of the two Ventura County projects that are primarily outside my district is a Center for Mental Health Services grant request dealing with mental health services for those in prison, in transition to being released and rejoining society. This program has already received $900,000 in Federal support for start-up, and the State has granted $1.6 million. It is an innovative program to provide a full range of mental health services to those in prison. There has been a significant reduction in recidivism from those who get this kind of treatment, and this is, I think, an ideal pilot study to show the importance of this treatment to other county prison facilities. The next project I am seeking $2.75 million for a child care center in Newbury Park. This will go an along with some local funds. The total budget is $3 million. We are also seeking in roughly the same area funds for a senior adult center expansion. Finally, for a YMCA that will be focusing much of its attention on the low income people of the region, providing social services. Roughly half the money there is being provided by local government and local charities, and we are seeking the other half from the Federal Government. Mr. Regula. Thank you. Things haven't changed too much since Interior. Mr. Sherman. I do have many things on the list, but I did put them in what I think is a reasonable order. As I say, the first one is a $500,000 project. Mr. Regula. Questions. Mr. Honda. ---------- Tuesday, April 3, 2001. RE: EDUCATIONAL PROGRAMS WITNESS HON. MIKE HONDA, A REPRESENTATIVE IN CONGRESS FROM THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA Mr. Honda. Good morning, Mr. Chairman. I think the last time I was before you we were talking about sleep or fatigue; is that correct? Mr. Regula. Right. Mr. Honda. I just want to thank the Chair and the distinguished members for the opportunity to present my testimony today. I have submitted a full written testimony for the record, but today I would like to focus on increasing school construction, recruiting 100,000 new teachers over the next 7 years, increasing Pell grants, as well as fully funding special education. If we are going to judge teachers, Mr. Chairman, and students by test scores, then Congress must fund programs that encourage improvement, growth within education, and we must demonstrate a commitment and respect and confidence in students by providing safe, permanent classrooms that are not crumbling. Nearly 80 percent of Americans support providing Federal funding for school repair and modernization, yet the President's budget eliminates $1.2 billion the Congress approved last year for school renovation and cuts another $433 million in unspecified programs. It would take nearly $112 billion to bring public and elementary and secondary schools to adequate condition. Thisfunding would help renovate up to 14,000 needy public schools and serve around 14 million students. I urge the committee to spend the $24.8 billion over the next 2 years in new tax credit bonds to renovate up to 6,000 schools. If we want students to learn more at a faster rate, then we need to reduce class size to enable teachers to teach efficiently. We also need to provide the teachers with the best training in order for them to provide the best instruction, and in order to attract and train teachers for both high need schools and underserved teaching topics, such as math and science, Congress should increase compensation for qualified teachers. According to the National Center for Education statistics, elementary and secondary school enrollment will grow from 52.2 million in 1997 to 54 million in 2006, requiring new schools and new teachers. Research has also shown that students in smaller classes and grades K-3 learn fundamental schools better and continue to perform well even after returning to larger classes after third grade. I urge the committee to continue to recruit 300,000 new teachers over the next 7 years in order to reduce class size averages in the early grades. I also encourage the $1 in new funding in 2002 and $18.4 billion over the next 10 years to provide up to $5,000 in supplemental pay to fully qualified teachers in high poverty schools or those in need of improvement under Title I. I request an increase of $600 in the maximum Pell grant, for a total of $4,350. I also ask that Congress fully fund special education in order to free up general fund money to allow schools to spend their money where it is most needed. By failing to meet these needs, Mr. Chairman, in the education system, we are failing to meet the needs of every single American. If we truly expect our schools to meet the challenges of greater accountability and higher achievement, then we as Congress need to ensure that we continue to fund the initiatives that we have put forward. Congress, as well as schools, need to be held accountable for their actions, and accountability is a two-way street. I just want to close by talking about accountability, and I guess student achievement. We know that we have made mandates, such as PL 94-142, which is requiring the pursuit of special education identification of youngsters. Since we are at 13 to 15 percent funding level, where we said we would be funding them at 40 percent, this ties up, as you well know, a lot of the local funds that school districts are trying to use, as they try to meet the mandates. So we have created a mandate without the full funding. As a school principal of two schools, identifying youngsters, I know this is a big struggle between parents who want youngsters to be identified and seek the special help and school districts in their inability to fully fund it all. If we really want to help our local schools, then we should fully fund special education so they can free up their local money to do the things that they could do more efficiently at the local level. Mr. Regula. Thank you. Questions? [The information follows:] [GRAPHIC(S) NOT AVAILABLE IN TIFF FORMAT] Ms. Pelosi. Mr. Chairman, since many of our witnesses today are senior Members of Congress, and Mr. Honda is a freshman, he alluded to his experience as a school principal, but, for the record, I wanted him to tell you how he knows of what he speaks as a very distinguished record as an administrator and a teacher in the San Jose area. Mr. Honda. Thank you, Ms. Pelosi. Mr. Chairman, I have spent over 15 years as an administrator in a K-8 school in South Central San Jose, and I know that we tell our parents what their rights are, and a lot of times, in the community I worked with, we had to be their advocates in order to be able to identify these youngsters. Many times school districts are so strapped that they are hesitant to go all the way, because they have to look at their bottom line. We put them in this situation that is untenable for both the districts and we frustrate our parents because they want the best for their youngsters, as do the schools. In other sections of our valley, parents do know their rights and they bring lawyers with them to the school districts. That creates, again, another situation where it is untenable for both sides. So if we solve this problem, we will solve the problem not only for the poor neighborhoods, who where administrators need to be the advocates of the youngsters, and also the well-to-do neighborhoods, where parents have the wherewithal to bring attorneys with them, and we can solve that problem by fully funding a mandate that we have put forward a few years ago. Ms. Pelosi. Mr. Chairman, our witness also brings impressive academic credentials from graduate studies at Stanford University in education. Mr. Honda. I get it. Mr. Regula. Thank you. Mr. Sherwood. Mr. Sherwood. Mr. Honda, as a 20-year school board member, I have great respect for your credentials as a principal and know how important that is. IDEA is something that we have to step up to, because we have created the mandate, but not put the funding with it. So I certainly agree with you on that, and the Pell grants, and a lot of your presentation. But when you talk about the Federal Government providing 100,000 new teachers or reducing the student-teacher ratio, doesn't that go against what you said earlier, that if we provide the IDEA funds, then the districts have the right to run, the ability to run their own deal? I am very pro-education then and I agree with you, but I think there are things we can do from Washington and things we shouldn't try to do from Washington. Mr. Honda. I agree with you, Mr. Sherwood. I was aschool board member for over 9 years in San Jose unified. I understand how budgets are dealt with. You are caught in the middle really as a school board, isn't that correct? At the Federal Government level, you know, the 100,000 teachers was an effort by the Federal Government to help reduce class sizes in many classrooms across the country. I think that is a good role for the Federal Government to do, to encourage the reduction of class size, and also to find funds to be able to compensate teachers who are teaching in high need areas and who are teaching in subject matters that are subject matters that we need, like math and science. Now, today we are talking about accountability, and if we are talking about accountability, then we have to also be accountable by fulfilling our obligation and fully funding that mandate. We are also talking about student achievement. Now, student achievement is obtained by having time on task, and the way we attain time on task in our role can be to help reduction of class size and encourage that, and we can fully help the local school districts if we fund fully special education. That frees up an incredible amount of monies that can be reinvested in reduction of class sizes and hiring new teachers. But when we do that, Mr. Sherwood, you know when we reduce class sizes, we create a need for more teachers. So we need to help support that effort and do just our part so until they get on their feet. The other thing is when we create more teachers, we need the classrooms when we reduce class size. If we don't do those two things, in addition to in our effort to reduce class size and to increase student achievement, if we don't help in the construction of new classrooms, providing new teachers, then we are only going one-third of the way. The other way we can help the local school districts is to free up the local money so they can reinvest that in those areas also. So we need to help school districts be able to provide new construction or modernize by putting up the $25 billion for the tax credit, because at the local level, when we create a bond indebtedness, we are in there for 30 years, right? If we come up with a tax credit against the interest on the principal, that reduces the local effort by 10, sometimes 15 or 20 years, and that is a big impact that is not really well seen by the general public. But we do know that, because we have been involved in that kind of dynamics of budgeting. So the Federal Government has a very unique role, but a very important role, to help attain accountability, student achievement, by helping the local classroom achieve that time on task by creating, hiring more teachers in those needed areas and providing the funds to create more classrooms or modernize classrooms. Mr. Sherwood. We agree and we disagree. Mr. Regula. Thank you, Mr. Honda. Mr. Honda. I am trying to give a macro-picture along with the details. Mr. Regula. Thank you. Mr. Honda. Thank you very much. Let me close, Mr. Chairman, by reiterating what some of the other folks said. I do think we need to start looking at more brain research. That is one area we haven't paid a lot of attention to. Youngsters do come with developing minds and brains. If we look at minds as one set, we have to look at the brain and its development in the process of education. The last comment is we are getting close to senior prom, graduation, and you know as well as I do that we see tragedy in our newspapers about youngsters dying behind the wheels, not because of drugs, not because of alcohol, but because of fatigue. I would just like to reiterate if there is some way we can admonish our schools to talk to our youngsters about taking care of themselves and not get overly tired so that they avoid those tragedies. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. Mr. Regula. Good point. Mr. Bereuter. ---------- Tuesday, April 3, 2001. APPROPRIATION FOR THE UNIVERSITY OF NEBRASKA--LINCOLN AND FUNDING FOR THE CLOSE UP FOUNDATION WITNESS HON. DOUG BEREUTER, A REPRESENTATIVE IN CONGRESS FROM THE STATE OF NEBRASKA Mr. Bereuter. Mr. Chairman, Ms. Pelosi, Mr. Sherwood, members, thank you for letting me testify today. May I observe the Chairman loose, unusually rested and tan, and I am not quite sure how he did it, but I know how he got his tan, because I was with him. I am here to testify, Mr. Chairman, and members of the subcommittee, on two items, an appropriation for the University of Nebraska--Lincoln, and funding of the Close Up Foundation. The first item is the Great Plains Software Technology Initiative. A substantial amount of detail is given about this program. It is, in some ways, a unique program, but I think it is replicable across the whole country. It takes a look at the importance of information technology, attempts oh to help our students cope with it; to use it well as a building block for their future. The program at the University is the result of an $18 million grant from one of our alumni, a challenge grant, and this would provide an opportunity for some internship programs as these students in their educational experience in this honors program implement the curriculum with industry applying what they are learning in the process as they approach the junior and senior year. This will provide an opportunity for additional students, but, most importantly, it helps develop further the curriculum which is replicablearound the country. It is an important initiative. I took a look at the whole range of proposals from the University of Nebraska systems, including this campus, which is in my district, and decided this was the one that I thought had the greatest opportunity for replicability around the country for its application. Secondly, I want to speak about the Close Up Foundation, as I usually do. They have a request for $1.5 million, which is almost below the area where you observe it. But I think it is an important testimony to the corporate world that provides most of the funds for the fellowships for low income students that the Federal Government and the Congress, specifically, thinks this is an important program. When I first came here, Nebraska was one of only seven States that did not participate, although I was speaking to teachers and student groups, and today Steve Janger, the president and founder, tells me that we have the highest participation rate on a per-capita basis in the country. I just spent about 45 minutes this morning speaking to students from my district. It is, in my judgment, the most outstanding citizen education program that brings people to Washington of any age group, and this happens to be a course focused than our high school juniors and seniors. I, along with Mr. Roemer, I believe, who also takes a lead on helping the Close Up Foundation, interested in making sure that this program which focuses on the Federal Government, a national program, is not block granted, that it maintains its separate identity through the authorization process, where Mrs. Landrieu is working in the Senate and where various House Members are taking a lead to make sure the Close Up Foundation's programs continue. Mr. Chairman, thank you very much for listening to my request. I would be happy to answer any questions you may have. [The information follows:] [GRAPHIC(S) NOT AVAILABLE IN TIFF FORMAT] Mr. Regula. Thank you. Mr. Sherwood. Mr. Sherwood. Thank you. Mr. Regula. Thank you. Mr. Dreier. This is a switch. I am usually on the other side of the table with you. ---------- Tuesday, April 3, 2001. RE: DIABETES RESEARCH WITNESS HON. DAVID DREIER, A REPRESENTATIVE IN CONGRESS FROM THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA Mr. Dreier. It is very nice to be here. Mr. Chairman, let me begin by extending very hearty congratulations to Mr. Sherwood on his recent appointment to this very important committee, and obviously the great intelligence that all of you had in placing him on your subcommittee. I want to congratulate you also, because I have spent the last 30 minutes or so listening to the testimony, and you have very important work with which you deal, and this is the first time I have been before this subcommittee, and I appreciate it. It is interesting, if 10 days ago someone had said to me that I was going to be testifying on diabetes funding before Ralph and his subcommittee, I would have said, well, that is interesting, but I was--really would be a little skeptical about it. A week ago Sunday night, many people watched something that took place in the area that I am privileged to represent, the Academy Awards, and I happened to see an old friend of mine, a guy called Doug Wick, accept the Oscar for the best motion picture. He produced Gladiator. Doug and I had been friends for 25 years, but, quite frankly, we had lost contact, and I have been very good friends with his parents, whom I mentioned to you the other day, Charles Wick, who is director of the U.S. Information Agency in the Reagan Administration, and Doug's mother, who was the chairman of the Reagan inaugurals in the 1980s, and I maintained contact with them, but frankly had not been in touch with Doug. But when Doug won this academy award, I decided to call him and congratulate him, and we had a nice chat, and he informed me that his daughter, Tessa, had 3 years ago--she is now 10--3 years ago had been diagnosed with juvenile diabetes, and he asked that I come before you to strongly support the funding that has been provided, and I am very happy that the President has doubled the budget for NIH, and we have also had a significant increase I know for diabetes funding, due in large part to your efforts, and I want to encourage that. What I would like to do is I would like to just read highlights of a letter that Lucy and Doug Wick's daughter, Tessa, wrote recently to a number of people, encouraging support for diabetes funding. I have a longer version which I would like to put in the record. Mr. Regula. Without objection. Mr. Dreier. As I said, she has politics in her veins with her grandparents, so she has a much longer version, but I am going to take the somewhat briefer version. I was rather moved by this. I haven't even met Tessa. I look forward to meeting her.But Doug encouraged me to be here, so let me just share this with you. ``January 15th, 1998, was a day I will never forget. It was the worst day of my life. I was at school in second grade when right before lunch my parents rushed through the door and told my teacher I would have to leave. I could tell by the look on their faces that they were not taking me to Disneyland. Instead, they drove me to the UCLA hospital. ``When I got to the hospital, the doctors told me I had diabetes. They said that I would have to get 2 or 3 shots every single day. I was used to maybe 1 shot every year. And there was more bad news. I was going to have to prick my finger 4 or 5 times a day and put a drop of blood into a little computer. I was going to have to do this before every meal, before bed, and maybe even in the middle of the night. So far, according to my sister's calculations, I have had to prick myself or inject myself with insulin over 4,500 times, and I have had diabetes for a year and a half. ``And then there was this creepy information about what I could eat. For instance, everyone likes to trade food at lunch, but unless I want to have an extra shot, which is usually never, I have to stay away from cheesecake, slurpies and cookies. I don't know if you are a big lunch trader, but I am, and take it from me, what is the use of trading food if you can't win any of the good stuff? ``Sometimes I try and remember what it was like to just eat whatever I wanted without taking a shot of insulin. I try and remember all the nights that I could just go to sleep without worrying about having a seizure in the middle of the night and making my mom wake up at 2 in the morning to check my blood sugar just in case. ``The last 2 summers I have gone to diabetes camp. The first day the camp director stood up and said, will anybody here with diabetes please raise your hands? And every single kid and all the staff members raised their hands. I couldn't believe it. Then the director said, I guess anybody here with diabetes will be the normal ones, and everyone clapped. ``I like feeling normal at camp. But where I really wanted to feel normal is at home, at school, and with my friends, and that is only going to happen one way, and that way is to find a cure. So please support diabetes funding and help us find a cure. ``Thank you very much, Tessa Wick.'' Obviously no one could say it any more eloquently than Tessa did in this letter, Mr. Chairman. But I just want to congratulate you and encourage you to proceed with funding for this very important effort to find a cure for diabetes. Mr. Regula. Thank you. I have a young lady in my district whose parents brought her to visit with me in the office, an identical situation. You really reach out to these young people. We hope to find something. We are going to commit as much in the way of resources as we can to this. Mr. Dreier. Thank you very much. I will convey that word to the Wicks for you. [The information follows:] [GRAPHIC(S) NOT AVAILABLE IN TIFF FORMAT] Mr. Regula. Give my best to Charles. He did a terrific job at USIA. I worked with him. Of course, Mrs. Wick was active with the Ford Theater. Mr. Dreier. Right. She still is. Mr. Regula. She still is. That is a great program there. Mr. Sherwood. Mr. Sherwood. It is bad enough with adult onset diabetes, but to think a child is looking forward to their whole life with this insidious disease, tell your young lady that her testimony was very compelling and we will pay attention. Mr. Dreier. Thank you very much, Don. I will try to be as nice to you all when you come before the Rules Committee as you have been to me today. Mr. Regula. We will keep that promise in hand. Mr. Dreier. I said I will try. Mr. Regula. Okay, Mr. Roemer. Mr. Roemer. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. Congratulations again on your ascension to the most important, in my estimation, of many of the important subcommittee chairmanships. As a member of the education committee, we look to you to fund many of our suggestions, but also to work in a bipartisan way with you on cooperative projects. Mr. Regula. We await your bill with interest. Mr. Roemer. We are working in a bipartisan way to try to report an ESEA bill to you. Congratulations to Mr. Sherwood on his elevation to this important committee. I ask unanimous consent to have my entire statement entered into the record. Mr. Regula. Without objection. ---------- Tuesday, April 3, 2001. RE: TRANSITION TO TEACHING WITNESS HON. TIM ROEMER, A REPRESENTATIVE IN CONGRESS FROM THE STATE OF INDIANA Mr. Roemer. My good friend, Mr. Dreier, talked about the Academy Awards. One of the parts that you may have seen, if you watched, Mr. Chairman, was that they wanted to keep the testimony as short as possible. I am sure you are looking for some of that in your time here. They were going to award a high definition television to those people that kept their testimony short. While I don't pretend to be any Julia Roberts, I might have more success between the two gentleman here in the room if I was for the three or four actual projects that I am going to ask your cooperation for. I will try to keep my testimony short, although I don't certainly have the---- Mr. Regula. You won't get a television, but you will get our appreciation. Mr. Roemer. Okay. I will try to get the appreciation and the support for my projects. Certainly the Preventing Child Neglect and Delinquency Program with the University of Notre Dame is important. The Ivy Tech College Machine Tool Training Apprenticeship Program, where we are trying to train more people in manufacturing jobs is very important in my district as we go through some rough layoffs. As Mr. Bereuter testified about the importance of the Close Up Program, that is a program that I have been involved in for my 10 years here in Congress. Steve Janger does a great job running that program, and they bring a host of minority students into Washington, D.C. for civic education. I hope you will continue to show your strong support for that. I am testifying here for a program that we started last year for the first time, Transition to Teaching. We provided in the appropriation billion dollars 31 million for this appropriation, and I would encourage your subcommittee to fund it once again. Imagine, Mr. Chairman, if you have a 17-year-old son or daughter, sending them to school, and you are going to try to encourage your son or daughter to maybe take an honors class in physics and go to Ohio State University. And that physics teacher is not certified in physics, but certified in physical education. Imagine if you have a second grader going to school and they are having difficulty reading, and we are having a teacher who is not certified in teaching reading in their first year who is not comfortable with the format, the subject matter or the inclusion of technology into the curriculum. Many of our first year teachers are in that position. We are going to have to hire 2 million new teachers in the next 10 years, many of which will fall into the situations that I have just outlined for you, in the second grade or as juniors in high school. We have this transition to teaching program that follows up on the very, very successful troops to teachers program that was instigated in 1994. We brought people from the military into the teaching profession. Many of them were trained in science and technology and math. Eighty three percent of them are still teaching in high need areas, in high need schools, and now we have followed on with the transition to teaching program where we are rewarding universities and not-for- positive profits to train the next generation of teachers in math, science, technology areas, to come into our schools in mid-career, at 45 or 50 years old, and teach in these subject matters in high need areas. This is a program that is going to work very well, that is hopefully going to address some of our need for the 2 million new teachers, although it is not the silver bullet by itself, and I hope you will continue to fund this program. Thank you for the testimony today. [The information follows:] [GRAPHIC(S) NOT AVAILABLE IN TIFF FORMAT] Mr. Regula. Thank you. I assume that there will be hopefully a lot of military retirees that will participate. Mr. Roemer. There will be some, Mr. Chairman. That has actually slowed down since 1994, with some of the attrition and some of the military people leaving now. We are doing everything we can to try to keep some of those people and retain them, and we are looking outside the military to follow up on the troops to teachers with this transition to teaching program. Mr. Regula. Mr. Sherwood. Mr. Sherwood. Thank you. Mr. Roemer. Thank you. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. ---------- Tuesday, April 3, 2001 FUNDING REQUESTS FOR EDUCATION, LABOR, AND HHS PROGRAMS WITNESS HON. MAXINE WATERS, A REPRESENTATIVE IN CONGRESS FROM THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA Mr. Regula. Ms. Waters. Ms. Waters. Good morning. Thank you very much, Mr. Chairman and members, for sitting in those seats for the hours that you have to sit to hear all of the testimony that comes before this committee and a particular thanks for the time that you are giving to all of the Members today. I am delighted to be here. I will go into a few of my requests. Mine are not as program specific as they are general in nature, and I have broken them down into the three areas that you have oversight responsibility for: Education, health and human services, and the labor issues. Mr. Regula. We will put your entire statement in the record. Ms. Waters. Thank you very much. On education I am hopeful that this Congress will be known as the Education Congress. We have all talked a lot about education, and there is some confusion about how much increase we are going to have in this education budget. I certainly hope that it is in the neighborhood of 11 percent or more rather than the 4 or 5 percent I keep hearing alluded to. Under education, educational technology is very important. This includes programs such as the Technology Literacy Challenge Fund. There is a digital divide, and if we are to prepare young people for the future, particularly in some of the poor communities, we must make sure that they have access to computers and new technology. So I think that we should not have any cuts in that area. Teacher training is extremely important. I was at a teacher training program this past weekend that was done by my local school district where they have the teachers, the administrators and the parents all together, and teacher training, mastering English for many of the immigrant students and students who are coming from other places, and I thought it was very, very effective. We have got to put money into teacher training programs. School modernization. Without a doubt we have schools that are falling apart. The air conditioning does not work, the heating systems are broken, graffiti on walls, the toilets not working. And so I think again if we are to be the Education Congress, we have got to make sure that we modernize our schools and buy some new schools because we have expanding populations that cannot accommodate the growth in many of these areas. After school programs such as the 21st Century Learning Centers, very important. Many of our schools could help out with the problems of the entire community if they had after school programs, programs that gave additional support to what is going on in the classrooms during the day, and I think we have talked about that a lot and we have these facilities that are sitting there and we should put them to good use. Let me move on to Health and Human Services. Numerous studies have demonstrated that minorities are disproportionately impacted by a variety of health problems. The National Institutes of Health is collaborating on 12 5-year projects to research how social and environmental factors contribute to the desperate health problems of racial and ethnic minorities. Cardiovascular disease, the death rate in 1998 for African Americans attributable to heart disease was 136.3 per 100,000 people compared to 95.1 per 100,000 for others. In cancer the Centers for Disease Control are currently allocated 174,000 for breast and cervical cancer screening. African American women have the highest death rate from cervical cancer. African American women have breast cancer rate similar to other women but die at greater numbers from preventable disease. Women should not be dying from breast cancer, but we need to have more research in those areas. You have heard probably a lot about AIDS. The Congressional Black Caucus has spent a lot of time on creating additional funding in this category of AIDS because of the alarming increases in HIV and AIDS in the African American community. I would ask this committee to pay special attention to that funding and the special category that we worked so hard for to help build capacity in minority communities, in poor communities that don't have the capability of dealing with outreach and prevention and all of that. Mr. Regula. We were at the CDC yesterday, Centers for Disease Control, and they made emphasis on that very point that you are making. Ms. Waters. Thank you so very much. It is extremely important. I won't go into the death rates. I will talk about diabetes that has been mentioned here a lot today. I want to tell you that I am watching too many people lose limbs and die from diabetes. They are cutting off arms and--well, feet and legs in particular, and people are going blind from diabetes. We need a lot of money in prevention and outreach so people can understand the symptoms of this disease and how to care for themselves. People are dying at a very early age. Mr. Regula. They made a good point yesterday that a lot of times people don't recognize it early enough and the impact on the body is already pretty progressive before it is recognized. Ms. Waters. That is right, Mr. Chairman. They refer to it as the silent killer because by the time many people get there, their bodies are already overcome by all that goes along with it and we need health care prevention for all of America, everywhere. Mr. Regula. I agree with that. Ms. Waters. So we don't learn until, you know, after we get 50 and things start falling apart. Then we get very conscious about our health. But I sure would have liked to have known a lot of this when I was a lot younger. In education also I wanted to mention Head Start. I worked in Head Start when Head Start first was originated. I was the supervisor parent involved in voluntary services, and of course I learned a lot about how parents and communities can be in control of the children's educational destiny. There is not a lot that I need to say about Head Start. I think everybody recognizes that it is a wonderful program that needs full funding, and to the degree we do that we have prepared children for school and they are prepared to read, et cetera. In labor, I want to mention Job Corps. Job Corps is very important and they really have done a very good job. I am concerned that we still have Job Corps programs that don't have the residential component. That is extremely important when you take these kids into Job Corps. If, for example, in Los Angeles, where we have a big Job Corps program, some of them have to go back to their communities at night, we lose them, or the influence of the community is so great that in one program they change clothes. For example, they wear one set of clothes while they are in the Job Corps, but when they go back to their communities they have to wear another set of clothes to identify with the neighborhoods that they come from. We would like to see more residential facilities associated so that by the time they transition out, they are into jobs, they are going to live on their own so they don't have to go back to those communities. The veterans employment and training I can't say enough about that. I have a program in my district. This is very important because they take the homeless veterans off the street, and they have a program that is designed to get them back into the main stream and they live in this facility while they are being trained and they are doing jobs. And many of them go on from there again to have their own homes and to live a full life and off the street and using their talent. And so these are just some of the things that I wanted to quickly mention in the short period of time that we have here today, and I appreciate your attention to these matters. [The information follows:] [GRAPHIC(S) NOT AVAILABLE IN TIFF FORMAT] Mr. Regula. Thank you. Mr. Sherwood. Mr. Sherwood. Thank you very much. Mr. Regula. I would like to visit with you on Head Start, but I will catch you on the floor. Ms. Waters. That is my favorite subject any time. Mr. Regula. I would like to talk with you about it and see how you suggest ways to making it even more effective. But I will find you there. We have one more witness. Ms. Waters. Thank you. ---------- Tuesday, April 3, 2001. FUNDING REQUESTS FOR FAR ROCKAWAY PENINSULA PROGRAMS IN QUEENS, NEW YORK WITNESS HON. GREGORY W. MEEKS, A REPRESENTATIVE IN CONGRESS FROM THE STATE OF NEW YORK Mr. Regula. Mr. Meeks. Mr. Meeks. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. I ask unanimous consent for my statement to be in the record in its entirety. Mr. Regula. Without objection. Mr. Meeks. Mr. Chairman, Mr. Sherwood, I thank you for this opportunity to present testimony to you today. And I will be succinct. Let me first, I come to talk about a specific program within my district. And we are asking for a mere $2 million earmarked to the Joseph P. Addabbo Family Health Care Center. Mr. Regula. I knew Joe well, good man. Mr. Meeks. He was a great man who did a lot in the community that I now represent, and this particular health care center we named after him because he really started it while he was here in Congress. And it deals with the part of the district that is probably the most isolated part of New York City, of all of New York City. It is a peninsula that is about 24 miles outside of downtown Manhattan. And many individuals who have to live on that peninsula, they are subject to just the services that are there. They don't have access to what we call the mainland, which is the other part of New York City, and that is just how difficult it is because of the transportation to the mainland if you happen to live on the peninsula. As you may know, the Joseph P. Addabbo Family Health Care Center is a private, nonprofit, federally funded community health center that was established in 1987 to provide comprehensive health services to the poor and medically indigent and or medically underserved residents of the Rockaway peninsula. The Rockaway peninsula ranked 14th among the 58 neighborhoods in the city for severe health-related problems in 1995 and 1996, the years for which the most recent data is available, with the rate of preventable hospital admissions more than 50 percent above the city average in 1996. This is an area home to the sickest and poorest segments of all of New York City, and this project that we are talking about is a joint project. It is a joint health and educational project that we are looking to develop on the peninsula. The Joseph P. Addabbo Family Health Care Center participated in a Robert Wood Johnson-funded needs assessment in the peninsula's low income communities. This project was designed to identify primary health care needs. As a result of this assessment, Far Rockaway has been designated a health crisis area by the Health Systems Agency of New York City. Another important aspect of the health profile of the Rockaway peninsula is a greater portion of its residents are children, with 38 percent of the population below 20 years of age. The large number of children and the high level of risk factors present in the community warrant particular attention to the needs of the children and young adolescents. Twenty-nine percent of the children live below the poverty level. Academic achievement levels in schools range near the bottom, with 54 percent of the students reading below their grade level and 44 scoring below their grade level in mathematics. There is also a high incidence of pregnancy among teenagers. In fact, it is 14.5 percent higher than all of the Borough of Queens, and New York City's average is only 8 percent. And most of these are young adults between the ages of 15 and 18 years old. The AIDS rate has been growing much faster than the growth rate increase of 82 percent from 1990 to 1991. Now this project is something that is a conglomerative. We have several different parts of the community that are engaged in helping this, and what we are trying to do is to get our Federal portion of it funded. For example, the New York City Housing Authority has invested $1.5 million into the project. The New York City Council has put in $1.1 million for it. The New York State Assembly has put in $500,000. The Borough President of Queens has put $2 million. York College, a local college within the district, is putting $500,000 into this. And the College of Aeronautics is putting another $500,000 in this. So this becomes for the peninsula a mass educational and health care facility that will cover some 104,000 people that currently live on the peninsula who are isolated from other parts of the city. So we just come asking to bring in our Federal share and ask for whatever consideration this committee could give us in getting an earmark of $2 million.

EDUCATION WITNESS LISA GRAHAM KEEGAN, CHIEF EXECUTIVE OFFICER, EDUCATION LEADERS COUNCIL Mr. Regula. Well, we'll get started. We have a number of witnesses this morning, and we need to keep moving, so that everyone has an opportunity to be heard and some time for questions. Our first witness, Bishop Conway, is not here yet, so I think we'll go to Lisa Keegan, the Chief Executive Officer, Education Leaders Council. Mr. Obey, would you like to make any comments here? Mr. Obey. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. I think we might as well get started. We're more interested in hearing what they have to say than what I have to say. Mr. Regula. Okay. Well, we're happy to welcome you. As you know, we have a five-minute rule, so if you'll summarize it will be helpful. Ms. Keegan. I'll do that. Thank you very much, Mr. Chairman. As you said, my name's Lisa Keegan. I am the Chief Executive Officer of the Education Leader's Council. We are a group of reform minded State school chiefs, State board members. We have governors who are members, and we have superintendents, teachers who are members. Our organization believes that reform is necessary in American education, and we have been engaged in that in our States. We believe that most of this will happen in the States. And we appreciate the opportunity to discuss with the Congress the direction that you're going to take in your budget and in the education bills before you. Our organization believes that in fact it is instruction that makes the difference for kids. It is not externals. What matters in a classroom is dependent on high expectation and instruction of a child. And we see going about that in a number of ways, many of which are very innovative in the States. But we do think it's our responsibility to educate the kids, and we're not looking for excuses or external situations to be solved. We don't believe class size is the answer, we don't believe that wealth issues are the answer, we don't believe color of children has anything to do with ability to learn. We feel very strongly that instruction is the answer and the classroom is where this has to happen. I want to talk a little bit about the proposals that have been made on the House budget. I realize many of them have reform components. Oftentimes those of us who talk about reform, it's happening here and we're listening to it, are characterized as not being interested in children or because we want to have a change, that's seen as very hostile. At the Council we try to remain very disciplined in our focus on a few things. One is that our appropriations from the Congress and in the States needs to be focused on the needs of kids and not on the bureaucracies that serve them. They need to as much as possible go directly to the classroom and to the needs of the instruction leader, who is the teacher, usually. Secondly, that oftentimes means that those resources will have to be changed in terms of formula. Where they are needed is in the classroom. Where they are often lobbied for is outside of the classroom, because organizations for education tend to be interested in organizations outside of the classroom. We believe that's problematic. Thirdly, we would like to see that the Congress, in pushing some majorly important ideas, will seek not to strangle so much with regulation but rather to support movement in the direction of strong instruction, strong assessments and product and result for students. We do believe it's absolutely essential to have assessments. You may find our opinion quite different than a lot of the education organizations. We make no apologies for assessments. We are about the business of assessing in our States. We think it's critically important. We think it's fabulous that the President has proposed $320 million in his budget to assist States with their testing programs. However, we also hope that most States are already about this business already. It's critically important to know where our kids are. We do take issue with much that's been said about the cost of assessment. We listened to a number of statements from the National Association of State Boards of Education saying that the cost was $7 billion for testing. That assumes about $125 per student, which we think is nonsense. In our States, where we are running testing programs, the State of Virginia has a very extensive budget that costs $4 per year. They are not testing annually. If they did that, that would double, but it would not be anywhere near this $125 that's being bandied about. In Massachusetts, which exceeds the President's proposal in terms of the frequency of testing and the depth of that testing, their costs are $14 per child. In Arizona, they are about $10 per child. So I would keep that in mind. The exercise ought to be strong but narrow focus on assessment and let the States go beyond if they want to. We feel it's very important to let them determine sort of the extent to which they're going to test, beyond reading and writing and mathematics that's being asked for, which we think is necessary, particularly to prove Title I. We are pleased with the increases to Title I. We think that money should follow students into programs that work for them. That has always been our bottom line. We recognize the desire to try to hold everybody harmless and make sure we're funding everybody last year the way we were, or this year the way we were last year because of political reasons. We would encourage you to let that money follow kids. Kids and parents will find successful programs and those programs should prosper because of it. We do support the money for teacher quality. We think it's very important to keep that flexible. There are a number of very, very innovative teacher quality programs going on, depending on the needs of States. Our States, our member States, have everything from Troops to Teachers to the teacher advancement programs, all sorts of innovative programs. We also hope you will continue support for choice. Our organization is a strong believer in school choice. We think all options that work for kids ought to be made available to them. And as State school chiefs, we support that. You find that might be unusual from time to time, coming from State school chiefs. We believe any school that's working well for a child is one worth investigation as to whether or not they'll be able to go there, and we're pleased that that discussion is ongoing in the Congress. Thank you very much, Mr. Chairman. [The justification follows:] [GRAPHIC(S) NOT AVAILABLE IN TIFF FORMAT] Mr. Regula. Did you have any input with the authorizing committee on the bill that's on the Floor this week? And if so, have you looked at it and do you agree with most of it? Ms. Keegan. Mr. Chairman, we have had input on that bill, which we appreciate. We like very much the President's original No Child Left Behind idea. We feel it's had to be compromised, we understand that. We support very much the emphasis on assessment. We would like to see that simplified a little bit, so that the States are looking at gain of all kids and that we don't make it so complicated that it fails in its implementation. We would like to see some of the amendments on flexibility and choice come on. It's very important for the members to recognize that any time there's a program, we have a requirement then to staff that program in our departments of education with X number of people, and it makes it very difficult to focus when you have to be maintaining dozens of different programs. We would like to be able to focus on our standards and assessment programs. Mr. Regula. Mr. Obey. Mr. Obey. As you know, the President has proposed under his plan that NAEP be used as a second check on the annual assessments. However, the bill before the House today allows States to use other tests that might not be as rigorous as NAEP. With which position do you agree, the President or the bill as it's before the House today? Ms. Keegan. Mr. Chairman and Representative Obey, we are fans of the NAEP test at the Education Leaders Council. We use it. We believe it is strong. We understand the concern that you could slide into a situation where you are sort of mandating a national tests that States have a discomfort with. Our concern is that we know the NAEP well, we understand it, we think the standards are rigorous. We would not look forward to having a requirement for a test that was not in line with our own standards. So any language that allows for an alternative, which we understand the need for, we hope will maintain the same kind of rigor that is present in the NAEP. We are big supporters of OERE, OERI and the research arm in the Department and of NAGBE, which sponsors the NAEP tests. It's something all of us have a great deal of confidence in right now. Mr. Obey. You prefer the NAEP, rather than some substitute as a second check? Ms. Keegan. Mr. Chairman, Mr. Obey, we prefer the NAEP in our organization. That does not mean that we don't understand there could be a need for something down the road. So all I'm saying is, to the extent there's going to be an alternative, we would like for that to be extremely tight in its language. I think we all have reason to be quite confident in the NAEP. Most of us are using its statistics right now when we talk about how the country is doing. So if we had to decide between one or the other, the NAEP or any series of tests that might not be of the same quality, we would go just with the NAEP. Mr. Regula. Mr. Jackson. Mr. Jackson. I have no questions, Mr. Chairman. Mr. Regula. One last question. We're going to have an amendment on the education bill on the President's suggestion on vouchers, or if the school is failing, the children have a choice. How does your group feel about that? The language was in the President's original bill. Ms. Keegan. Correct. Mr. Chairman, we support that. We don't believe any child should be in a school that's failing. There are options available for these children. We believe the first priority is to have a child in the classroom with a teacher that's going to move that child. We realize these are difficult decisions for lots of people, but for us, it's an easy decision. We want that child educated and in any way we can find to do that, we will be supportive of. Mr. Regula. Do you like the Troops to Teachers program? Ms. Keegan. Mr. Chairman, we do. Most of our States are using it. We've had a great deal of success with it. When I was the chief in Arizona, we had great success with that program and Teach for America, and any number of alternative entryways into teaching. Mr. Regula. I'm curious, you take this retiree from the military, did you require that they go back to school and go through the hoops to get certification that you normally have to do? Ms. Keegan. Mr. Chairman, no, and that's what's interesting about these alternative programs. They do go through preparation in instruction and classroom management. There are some tests to determine content knowledge. That's similar to Teach for America, another project that brings in very young graduates and puts them in inner city schools, which has been very successful. We believe there are several ways to prepare very strong teachers and make them qualified. There does have to be an instruction, but probably not the traditional route. Mr. Regula. Well, thank you very much. Mr. Jackson. Mr. Jackson. I think I do have a question, just one. At least as I understand the nature of our education system in the country, we have, based upon the way our country has evolved, 50 separate and unequal States, 3,068 separate and unequal counties, and at least as many separate and unequal cities. Many States derive their revenue from agricultural economy, others derive them from a service based economy, others derive them from an industrial based economy, which only exacerbates the nature of that inequality. So for the 53 million children in public schools across the country who find themselves in the 85,000 separate and unequal schools in the 15,000 separate and unequal school districts, I'm wondering how your programs overcome those limitations, and how the vast majority of those children who find themselves in those unequal schools are reached? Ms. Keegan. Mr. Chairman, Representative Jackson, we think this is a huge concern. In fact, it's a concern that a lot of people don't like to address. That is the fact that public education in its traditional form segregates by wealth, because it relies on a property tax base and a boundary by which to serve children. So it doesn't so much keep children within a neighborhood as it keeps other children out. We believe that the solutions to this need to be generated by the State, but that they ought to be generated by coming up with funding formulas wherein money follows students, into school that work for them, that funding probably ought to be more generated by shared taxes rather than just local property taxes. And as you know, there is a wealth of political fallout when you start to talk about changing district basis for education. So it is a local-State issue, it is very difficult. I think there are 25 States right now, Representatives, thatare engaged in a sort of Supreme Court argument over this very issue. It's something that our organization has been involved in at the State level and will continue to be, because we think there's a moral imperative. Mr. Jackson. Does your organization believe that every child deserves the right to an equal, high quality education? Ms. Keegan. Mr. Chairman, Representative Jackson, yes, sir. Mr. Jackson. Is there any way for us to guarantee that every child gets such a right without the idea of education as a fundamental right being part of our constitution? Ms. Keegan. Mr. Chairman, Representative Jackson, I'm not quite sure that it isn't at least a moral imperative as part of what we do. Obviously that has not been part of the constitution overall. It has been part of implementation in every State. I don't see that changing. I think most people are dedicated to that ideal. We have tripped ourselves up in its implementation, we believe, and we just have to address that without pointing fingers at why that happened. Mr. Jackson. I thank you. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. Mr. Regula. Mr. Obey. Mr. Obey. Mr. Chairman, I just can't help but observe, it's very interesting that the bill before the House today would withhold education funding from States if children are not tested annually. For instance, if Wisconsin decided to test on math in odd numbered grades, and decided to test on reading in even numbered grades, money would be withheld from the State for exercising that judgment. But money would not be withheld from States if they have outrageous differences in the dollars per child in say, Maple School District in my district versus Maple Bluff, where they spend almost twice as much money. I find that an interesting focus on the hole in the doughnut. Mr. Regula. I think our witness would agree with you, but we're going to have to move on. ---------- Tuesday, May 22, 2001. LIHEAP WITNESS THE MOST REVEREND EDWIN M. CONWAY, AUXILIARY BISHOP OF THE ARCHDIOCESE OF CHICAGO Mr. Regula. We're pleased to call Bishop Conway, the Bishop of the Archdiocese of Chicago. Mr. Jackson, I understand you'll introduce our guest. Mr. Jackson. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. Mr. Obey. Where is Chicago? [Laughter.] Mr. Jackson. Somewhere sandwiched between Ohio and Wisconsin. Mr. Regula. It's the new home of the Boeing Company. Mr. Jackson. When our bill comes before the Committee, I want both of you to remember that. Mr. Regula. I said it's the new home of the Boeing Company. Mr. Jackson. Yes, sir, it certainly is. Mr. Chairman, I am honored today to introduce the Most Reverend Edwin M. Conway, who was ordained a priest on May 6th, 1960, and ordained a bishop on March 20th, 1995. Currently, Bishop Conway serves as the Episcopal Vicar for Vicariate Number Two of the Archdiocese, which includes supervision of 63 parishes on the north and northwest side of Cook County, Illinois. Bishop Conway serves as the liaison for the Health Affairs Office of the Archdiocese, which oversees 23 Catholic health care centers and long term health care facilities of the Archdiocese. He has served as an associate pastor and in various roles of service and management within the Catholic Charities system and the Archdiocese of Chicago. Bishop Conway was the administrator of Catholic Charities from 1980 through 1997, and served as the director for the Archdiocese of Chicago and was a member of the Cardinal's Cabinet from 1985 through 1997. Bishop Conway holds a masters degree in theology and a masters degree in social work from Loyola University in Chicago. Mr. Chairman, and members of the Subcommittee, I present to you Bishop Conway. Bishop Conway. Thank you. Mr. Regula. Thank you. We're happy to welcome you, and look forward to your comments. Your testimony will be made part of the record. Bishop Conway. Good morning, Chairman Regula and thank you, Mr. Jackson, for the invitation to come and also for your introduction this morning. And good morning also to the members of the Committee that are here before us. We have written testimony, I'd like to submit that and just spend briefly, some four or five minutes here discussing some of the high points of that testimony. Thank you for the invitation to speak to you this morning regarding the Low Income Home Energy Assistance Program, LIHEAP. I am an Auxiliary Bishop from the Archdiocese of Chicago. Cardinal George was asked, as the Archbishop of Chicago, to come and testify this morning. Fortunately orunfortunately, he has been called to Rome for a Consistory of the Cardinals along with Pope John Paul II and has asked me to speak on his behalf for the Archdiocese of Chicago. As you will see from my resume, I've spent more than 30 years with the Catholic Charities of the Archdiocese of Chicago. Many of those years I spent as its administrator. Thus, I speak from my own experience as well as a bishop in Chicago which oversees some 67 parishes, serving multi-ethnic and multi-racial communities. The Archdiocese of Chicago has 377 parishes, with approximately three-quarters of a million active parishioners. This morning I wish to speak to you specifically about the Low Income Home Energy Assistance Program. I fervently urge you to appropriate at least $2.3 billion in core funding for the LIHEAP program for the fiscal year 2002. The overall totals, you recall, last year were $2.3 billion and were made available to all the States in order to help low income families with home energy problems. Illinois received approximately $132 million and it was supplemented by an additional $65 million in State grants. This money came from various sources within State supplemental low income assistance funds. The program in Chicago was administered through the Community Economic Development Association of Cook County, which serves the household of elderly disabled and others who are disconnected or meet the poverty guidelines. In Illinois, approximately 775,00 households are eligible for low income below this level. Currently, Peoples Gas in Chicago records approximately 25,000 elderly and disabled with heating bills that are significantly or substantially past due. I point this out as it comes time when gas prices have more than doubled. The energy bills will not return to the 2000 year level in the foreseeable future, which gives us an example of the Archdiocese itself, which purchases gas at approximately 60 percent less value from NICOR and Peoples Gas in Chicago. Based upon that usage, however, of the present and past heating seasons, an additional $8 million will be required of the Archdiocese in payments in the year to come. This will severely decrease the amount of discretionary dollars that the parishes and pastors will have to distribute to poor clients who are experiencing eminent shut-off of the utilities. I point out that in the week prior to April 4th, the deadline for gas shut-off in Chicago, the Archdiocese of Chicago Catholic Charities received more than 300 requests for energy assistance over the past several months. They have received more than 500 requests regarding utility assistance. The average bill for heating in Illinois in the area of Chicago is $1,500. The State assistance LIHEAP program is $495. This amount is less than one-third of the energy bill going to assist elderly and the vulnerable poor. The Bishops of Illinois have talked about the right to housing for families and their children, and they have sought to estimate the number of households in which families will be experiencing no heat. I therefore strongly believe, and I have been informed by the Catholic Charities of the United States, that the situation nationally, especially in some of the colder States, is also parallel to Illinois. I stress the fact that unless the amount is restored to at least last year's level, more than 50,000 households in the Chicago area will be ineligible this coming year if the current grant remains the same. The facts in this instance are very clear, the dramatic increases in home energy costs, lack of corresponding increases in salaries and income, results certainly and assuredly that families will be unable to meet their bills. Therefore, we implore this Committee to fund LIHEAP for the year 2002 at at least equal to the amounts in the resources that were available to the States for the last winter, or $2.3 billion. And since even this amount may not be adequate to meet the needs of low income families living on the edge of homelessness, we would strongly encourage an appropriate increase over this level in the overall funding. We hope at the very least that if this amount remains as introduced by the Administration, the $300 million be also allocated in an appropriate basis to each State. We know that our brothers and sisters in California have been publicly and visibly shown to have utility problems. We are seeking some sort of the same recognition in Illinois and among our Chicago citizens, who rely on this program to continue to survive. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. And thank you to the members of the Committee for receiving testimony this morning. [The justification follows:] [GRAPHIC(S) NOT AVAILABLE IN TIFF FORMAT] Mr. Regula. Thank you. Mr. Obey. Mr. Obey. Bishop Conway, I don't know if you're aware of it, but Chairman Regula is a member of what is known as the College of Cardinals in the Congress. Bishop Conway. Which means? Mr. Obey. I thank you for reminding him that he doesn't belong to the only College of Cardinals. Mr. Regula. I didn't get summoned to Rome, though. [Laughter.] Mr. Obey. Let me simply ask one question. In your statement, you referred to the need for funding LIHEAP at last year's level of $2.3 billion. I believe what that refers to is that $1.7 billion was made available in the regular 2000 appropriation, plus an additional $556 million was available in carry-over funds, for a total of $2.256 billion. I think it's important for the Committee to understand that if we adopt the President's fiscal year 2002 request, which is $1.7 billion, composed of $1.4 billion in core funds and $300,000 in contingency funds, that States would see a 25 percent reduction in the actual amount of deliverable aid next winter. How many people did you say that would not be served in Illinois? Bishop Conway. In Illinois, we think there will be at least 50,000 households in the Chicago-land area that will not be. And also we know that probably the $2.3 billion is inadequate. It certainly is what we would like you to achieve, but even more is needed if we're going to match the increasing energy bills. Mr. Obey. I certainly agree with that. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. Mr. Regula. Mr. Jackson. Mr. Jackson. Mr. Chairman, I did have a question, but the Bishop spoke to it in his remarks. My district, the Second District of Illinois, receives $12 million of that $76 million in the LIHEAP program. The next closest district receives some $4 million. So I'm very well aware of the benefit that LIHEAP provides, and I think the Bishop's testimony and his extended remarks, when we begin to negotiate over our bill, I certainly hope that the Committee will take into account that there are a number of communities, particularly those who suffer in Chicago winters, who are in desperate need of this program, and any efforts to under-fund the program can only create the kind of misery amongst some Americans that none of us would want in a Chicago winter. So I'm certainly hoping, Mr. Chairman, that you'll be sensitive and the Committee will be sensitive to the Bishop's remarks. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. Mr. Regula. I might say, I think there will be a supplemental emergency appropriation. It will include money for LIHEAP. I know that's in the planning stage. I'm not sure how much yet. But there will be. Mrs. DeLauro. Mrs. DeLauro. I'm delighted to hear that the Chairman thinks there will be a supplemental appropriation. We weren't sure that that was going to be the case. Clearly, LIHEAP is a lifeline for people in our communities where we have tough winters, and those that have tough summers as well, as we've seen in the past. And we need to continue the past efforts with regard to LIHEAP, especially now given the kinds of crises that people are facing in their lives with energy. Thank you. Mr. Regula. As I understand it, you just deal with Chicago? Bishop Conway. That's correct. Mr. Regula. How about the outlying areas? Is that part of another---- Bishop Conway. It's a different diocese. Mr. Regula. Configuration? Bishop Conway. Yes, different diocese. However, we are in communication and we have a statewide organization. The Illinois Catholic Conference, that deals with issues. It's fundamentally the same. In fact, some of the rural areas outside Chicago, which are more devastated economically, are really concerned about facing this. Mr. Regula. Does your diocese administer this program, or just work with individuals to apply for it? Bishop Conway. Yes, it works with the county to distribute the funds. Mr. Regula. What's the policy, pretty much, of the gas companies? Do they shut off if they don't get paid? Bishop Conway. Well, this has been a very sensitive point. We've gone through several public manifestations and demonstrations about this. And currently, it's in abeyance until it is handled in a much better way. There were two due dates set and at both times the gas companies gave a reprieve until some further discussion was done by the local municipalities, county government and hopefully the Federal Government. Mr. Regula. Do you think most people know that this is available and take advantage of it? Because otherwise they could be in a real crisis situation. Bishop Conway. I think most people become aware of it and maybe they're not aware of it at first glance, where they certainly begin to come to the point of having their gas turned off or collaterally through some other arrangement with the social service agency they become aware of this and apply for it. Mr. Regula. I assume the gas company would let them know. Bishop Conway. They do. Mr. Regula. They have an interest, too. Bishop Conway. Right. Mr. Regula. Well, thank you very much for coming and testifying this morning. Bishop Conway. Thank you. ---------- Tuesday, May 22, 2001. WOMEN'S HEALTH WITNESS CAROLYN M. MAZURE, CHAIR, WOMEN'S HEALTH RESEARCH COALITION Mr. Regula. I think Mrs. DeLauro, we'll move then to Carolyn Mazure, the Chair of the Women's Health Research Coalition. You'll be introduced by Mrs. DeLauro. Mrs. DeLauro. Good morning. Mr. Chairman, let me just say thank you to you and to my colleagues. It's such a pleasure to welcome to the Committee a woman whose work I truly do admire greatly, and of whom I'm tremendously proud to count as one of my constituents. Dr. Carolyn Mazure is a professor of psychiatry at the Yale University School of Medicine, the principal investigator for the Donohue Women's Health Investigator Program at Yale. I might add that that is the largest university-wide women's health research program in the United States. Dr. Mazure is a national leader in the field of women's health, conducting research on women and tobacco dependence, post-traumatic stress disorder in determining predictors of depression and psychosis. She serves on the board of the Society of Women's Health Research and in addition to that, she really has been a leader in bringing the work of research on women's health into the community, to look at how we actually try to improve the health and the lives of women across their entire life span. So it's a great honor for me to welcome Dr. Mazure and to be able to say to the Committee, this is someone who really does have an unbelievable grasp of what is happening out there with regard to women's health and research and look forward to her comments on the budget for the next fiscal year, and say thank you to you for spending some time with us, Doctor. Mr. Regula. Thank you. Your entire statement will be put in the record, and we'll appreciate your summarizing. Ms. Mazure. Thank you. First, thank you, Congresswoman DeLauro, for your very kind words of introduction. It's very much appreciated. Mr. Chairman and other members of the Committee, I appreciate the opportunity to speak with you today. For the record, I am Dr. Carolyn Mazure, with the academic affiliations as noted by Congresswoman DeLauro. I'm testifying today in my capacity as the chair of the Women's Health Research Coalition, which was created by the Society for Women's Health Research two and a half years ago. The Coalition has nearly 200 members committed to advancing women's health research. Most of these members really include national leaders in scientific and medical investigations and in academic institutions throughout the country, and also does include people from voluntary health organizations as well as pharmaceutical and biotech companies, again, to the larger issue of trying to make transfer of information possible across these different constituencies. To begin, let me first emphasize that we strongly support the goal of improving the health and the health care of all individuals through newly discovered research based information that can be incorporated into medical practice and also incorporated into personal practice. But there are at least three reasons for a special focus on women's health and on understanding what are referred to as sex-specific factors in health and disease. First, women historically have been under-represented as subjects of scientific research for a variety of reasons. And when women have been included, even to this day, sex-specific analyses of health data have not traditionally been conducted. A recent GAO report coming out in 2000 also confirmed that finding. Second, age adjusted indicators of both health status and also of service utilization continue to show that women have more acute medical problems and higher hospitalization rates, even when you exclude hospitalizations due to childbirth. Finally, there are large gaps in our scientific knowledge about disorders and conditions that either affect women solely or predominantly or differently. For all these reasons, we ask the Congress to play a pivotal role in advancing research on the health of women, research that we believe will make a difference in women's lives and in so doing, will benefit every person in the country. That's what brings me to why I am testifying here today. The Coalition is seeking the Subcommittee's support on four major priorities. First, we join with others who have appeared before this Committee to advocate for a $3.4 billion or 6.5 increase in the NIH budget for fiscal year 2002. However, importantly, as the NIH grows to meet the great need for medical research in many areas of health, we ask for your support in ensuring that there be at least comparable increase directed towards women's health research within that pot of money. There is too much work to be done, as detailed in the written statement that I'm providing, not to ensure such funding. Second, we ask that the various offices, advisors and coordinators throughout the Department of Health and Human Services, those individuals who enhance the Department's focus on women's health research, be funded at least to the Administration's recommended levels. In particular, we strongly support the $50 million request in the President's budget for the Office of Research on Women's Health, which is, as you know, based within the NIH, and the $27 million request for the Office of Women's Health in the Office of the Secretary. These are significant increases that need to be maintained, but I want to point out also that other women's health representatives in SAMHSA and CDC and FDA andelsewhere also need strong support to carry out their missions. Third, within the $50 million for the Office of Research on Women's Health, that is the office with NIH, we ask for your strong support in creating women's health research centers, as recommended in the Administration's proposed budget. We believe these should be well funded interdisciplinary, peer reviewed centers, which collectively cover a wide range of critical sex and gender based health research issues. Such centers would provide an effective mechanism for operationalizing a strategy in women's health that would pursue a research agenda that's been designed by the Office of Research on Women's Health. This strategy is used, that is the strategy of centers, is used in cancer research, it's used in asthma research. Surely we can do it in a field of research that will directly affect so many of our citizens. With this funding, the entire field of sex and gender based research can move into a new era. Finally, we ask for your support in maintaining and expanding the BIRCWH program, which is sponsored by the Office of Research on Women's Health, again as recommended in the President's budget. BIRCWH, which stands for Building Interdisciplinary Careers in Women's Health, is training the next generation of women's health researchers. It is strongly supported by the institutes within NIH and by the community. NIH plans to issue a request for applications to generate a new round of these centers, but the Office of Research on Women's Health must have the $50 million appropriation to create them. Just last month, the Institute of Medicine issued a landmark report called Exploring the Biological Contributions to Health Research: Does Sex Matter? The results were unequivocal with regard to the incredible scientific opportunity in studying sex differences with regard to health. This Subcommittee and the Department of Health and Human Services routinely does turn to the IOM for advice on major questions related to medical research and practice because the IOM provides objective, scientific analysis. The report makes it clear that sex is a critical variable in understanding biology at the cellular level, and remains so through early development, puberty, adulthood and old age. We hope that the Committee will support the priorities I've outlined above to begin the process of implementing the IOM's fundamental conclusion that sex matters. Mr. Chairman, Committee, the Women's Health Research Coalition stands ready to work with the Subcommittee to advance research on women's health and sex-specific factors in health and disease and thus build a better future for all Americans. Thank you for this opportunity to testify. [The justification follows:] [GRAPHIC(S) NOT AVAILABLE IN TIFF FORMAT] Mr. Regula. Thank you. Mr. Obey. Mr. Obey. No questions. Mr. Regula. Mr. Jackson. Mr. Jackson. No questions, Mr. Chairman. Mr. Regula. Mrs. DeLauro. Mrs. DeLauro. No questions. I think Dr. Mazure just laid out a mission for all of us, and the kind of first-rate work that is done that we have seen and see the results of, I think just continues to let us know that we need to focus in this area, because of what the results have been, and where we might go. Thank you for your great work. Mr. Regula. I'm curious, obviously, the life expectancy of women is substantially higher than men. Shouldn't the focus be perhaps on both men's and women's health issues? For some reason it's just been women's health out at NIH. It would seem to me that it ought to be a little broader. What would be your observation? Ms. Mazure. I think that's a very important point. The way in which we really see it is, I think several points are embedded in the answer. One is that historically, women have not been the subjects of research. So we have a bit of scientific catch-up to do. Secondarily, in the new science and the way in which we're approaching women's health, we're very interested in what's referred to as sex-specific differences. And by looking at differences between women and men in reference to all forms of illness and all forms of disease prevention, we really are discovering as much about men's health as women's health. So I think the broad field of women's health really advances health knowledge in all areas for everyone. I also do think that in reference to the issue that you raised where men tend to live on average a shorter length of life than women, living longer doesn't always necessarily mean living better. It often is associated with higher rates of chronic disease, cancer, dementias, cardiovascular illness. Nevertheless, I think we have to do better at communicating information about health to men so that men are in a position to take better care of their own health. Mr. Regula. Thank you. We appreciate your being here. ---------- Tuesday, May 22, 2001. SMALL SCHOOLS WITNESS TOM VANDER ARK, EXECUTIVE DIRECTOR OF EDUCATION, BILL AND MELINDA GATES FOUNDATION Mr. Regula. Our next witness today is Mr. Tom Vander Ark, who's the Executive Director of Education for the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation, to talk about small schools. We're pleased to welcome you, Mr. Vander Ark. Mr. Vander Ark. Thank you, Mr. Chairman, members of the Committee. It's a pleasure to be with you today. I'm Tom Vander Ark, I'm the Executive Director for Education for the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation in Seattle. There's been a great deal of attention paid to elementary schools in particular in education reform in the last decade, and very little paid to high schools, which is surprising, because American high schools work well for relatively few students. Unfortunately, that's most true for economically disadvantaged students and students of color. But today there are hundreds of schools that are bucking that trend. They're public schools, charter schools, private schools, urban, rural, they're suburban schools, but they all have one thing in common: they're small. After 40 years of consolidation, about two-thirds of American students now go to high schools larger than 1,000 students. As former Governor Jim Hunt said, we've made a terrible mistake in America. And we think it's time to reverse that mistake. There are decades of research, and especially a plethora of research in the last five years that small schools make a difference. It's interesting to note that there's very more conclusive research on small schools than there is on small class size. And yet small class size is a top of mind issue for teachers and parents. What we know from the research is that small schools improve attendance, achievement, motivation, graduation rates, it results in higher college attendance rates, school safety and school climate are improved, there's better parent and community involvement and better staff satisfaction. Mr. Regula. I'm sorry to interrupt you, would you define small school? You're talking about it as a term. If we had some definition it would be a little easier to relate to your testimony. Mr. Vander Ark. The research is inconclusive on that front. We generally say about 400 students, or less than 100 students per grade. So if it's a 6-12 school, it might be 600 students. But it's less than 100 students per grade. Mr. Regula. Would that be, would you define it as a small school in terms of a building, could it be one school district with a lot of small units? Mr. Vander Ark. Absolutely. I'll give you an example. The Julia Richman High School in the East Side of Manhattan, in the early 1990s, was one of three dozen large comprehensive high schools in New York City that had graduation rates of less than 25 percent. Let's think about that for a minute. This is a school that serves economically disadvantaged students, primarily students of color. They had a graduation rate of less than 25 percent. Today that center, it's now called the Julia Richman Education Complex, that complex now has four small focused high schools, a K-8 school, a school for autistic children and a day care center. So there's about 1,600 students on that campus. All four of those high schools have graduation rates between 90 and 95 percent and college attendance rates of the same. All of the students in that school share the amenities of a large school, gymnasiums, auditorium, performing arts center, and a library. All of these schools, and the hundreds of great small schools in New York, in Chicago, in the Bay Area, all operate on the same per pupil allocation as large schools. So the notion that they're less efficient is absolutely not true. For the same money, we can get the benefits that I described earlier. Why is this important to us? It's become a focus of our work because high schools are the largest, the least efficient and least effective and the most intractable schools in our system. We've developed a two-pronged approach of starting new small high schools and trying to help transform big bad schools into a multiplex of good small schools. But changing an American tradition is far from easy. The Gates Foundation and a number of other private philanthropies have contributed considerable resources to this daunting challenge. But it's going to take multi-sector collaboration to effect real change at scale. There's a growing consensus that our high schools aren't working, especially for most economically disadvantaged students. And there's fortunately a growing consensus about the attributes of schools that work for all students. We feel strongly that it's time to address this important injustice in our schools and to promote real design, so that all of our schools work for all of our kids. Thank you for the opportunity to testify. [The justification follows:] [GRAPHIC(S) NOT AVAILABLE IN TIFF FORMAT] Mr. Regula. Mr. Obey. Mr. Obey. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. Isn't it true that the research shows that student performance is superior in high schools that are smaller than 800 students as opposed to larger? Mr. Vander Ark. No question. Mr. Obey. I find it interesting and frustrating that last year this Committee worked to increase the appropriation to assist school districts to explore the opportunity to create smaller schools, especially at the high school level. We increased funding for that program from $45 million to $125 million. But, the bill which is on the floor today eliminates this specific authorization for small schools. I find that distressing because I think that small schools are absolutely critical at the high school level if we're going to improve not just academic behavior but social behavior as well. I congratulate the organization that you are running for its emphasis on the problem. Just one other point. It's my understanding, Mr. Chairman, that in Florida, Governor Bush and the legislature have passed legislation requiring that all new high schools that are built be of the smaller variety. I wish that nationally we would get the same message as we're getting from the kid brother in Florida. [Laughter.] I also would note that I've seen a number of comments which suggest that small high schools are more costly per student. My understanding is that while they may have a higher cost per student, that they are less costly per graduate, indicating that there is a higher level of performance that pays off economically as well as academically. Mr. Vander Ark. Mr. Chairman and Mr. Obey, our findings are that the hundreds of small schools that exist today generally operate on the same per pupil allocation. I would argue, as Ms. Keegan did earlier, that we do need to address the inequities in our funding system. This is true especially in our major cities. I would agree that we need funding that's needs based and that follows the students. That's a different but related issue to this one. I think the important point here is, there are hundreds of great schools doing a great job for the same per pupil allocation. Now, two related issues on capital costs. Some would argue that it costs more in terms of capital construction per pupil for a small school. That may be true if you want to adorn it with all the amenities that we traditionally think of on a secondary campus. But clearly, there's opportunity, as Julia Richman and many others illustrate, for a number of schools to share a campus facility with the traditional accoutrements of an American high school. The second issue is that there is a transaction cost, a transformation or a redesign cost to transform a big, comprehensive school into a multiplex of small schools. It's not capital cost, it is primarily time and resources for the staff to rethink the way their schools are designed, to be trained to teach in small teams, to serve as advisors for students. And that's what the bulk of our funds pay for, is that redesign effort. Mr. Obey. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. Mr. Regula. Mr. Obey, you and I both went to the Aspen seminar. As I recall, Dr. Levy from the New York City system was pointing their system in that direction. Is my recollection similar to yours? Mr. Obey. He certainly indicated that he wanted to, in the remarks that he gave to the conference. Mr. Vander Ark. I can address that, Mr. Chairman and Mr. Obey. The Gates Foundation, Carnegie and the Open Society Institute have helped to support a major initiative with New York City and New Visions for Public Schools in an effort to both start new small schools and to attempt to transform 12 to 15 of the worst large high schools in New York into small schools, small, a multiplex of small schools much as I've described. Mr. Regula. Do athletics get in the way? Mr. Vander Ark. Absolutely. This is dangerous and politically radioactive work, largely because high schools work today for elite athletes and for the top 10 percent of our students. Those are vocal and influential parents. So it is clearly an issue. I'll mention the Julia Richman story. The students from those four high schools play together on interscholastic teams. They compete, they mix teams and compete internally on intramural teams. So again, that's a great model of how you can have your elite sports, if that's what a community desires, but have very small focused coherent programs where every child gets the attention they deserve. Mr. Obey. Mr. Chairman, I guess I would observe that it would be interesting to compare headline size for a high school that wins a conference football championship versus a high school that produces an unusually large number of national merit scholars. Mr. Regula. I agree with you completely. I live on a farm. At the end of my driveway is an old red brick one room school that was closed about 50 years ago. I've said many times, I have three children, I would have been absolutely delighted had they gone there. Because they would have had eight grades eight times, provided there was a good teacher. That's always a caveat that goes all the way througheducation. We're into a consolidated school, and I see some real problems. I'm curious, how does your foundation practically, how do you try to encourage this trend, probably to discourage consolidations or big schools and at the same time encourage some deconsolidation, if you will? Mr. Vander Ark. Well, Mr. Chairman, I'll give you an example of the work that we just initiated in Colorado with Governor Owens' office. First of all, we're helping to create a statewide foundation to create a network of technology focused high schools in the most economically disadvantaged neighborhoods in Colorado. Secondly, we're working with the State accountability system, so that every high school that's labeled as under- performing in their State becomes eligible for the program that we've designed, that will actually supplement the State aid to failing schools. So they get a small amount of money from the State and then if they can demonstrate to us some sense of leadership and initiative, we'll supplement that with additional money, with outside consulting help and some clear direction on what they ought to do. Mr. Regula. You've obviously worked with the New York system and from what I remember of Dr. Levy's comments it's working pretty well in terms of, as compared to what it had been before. Mr. Obey. I'm sorry, I didn't hear you. Mr. Regula. I said, I think Dr. Levy indicated in his testimony to us in that seminar that their decentralization was working fairly effectively for students. Mr. Obey. He thought it was. He also mentioned that there were a considerable number of critics after him, as you indicated. But I think he'll outlast them. Mr. Regula. Chicago's done--I'm sorry Mr. Jackson isn't here--Chicago's done some pretty innovative things. I met with their superintendent, and at least I was under the impression that they were doing what you're suggesting. Is that accurate? Mr. Vander Ark. Mr. Chairman, that's accurate. Pat Walsley, who is now the dean at the University of Washington, recently authored a study called Small Schools Great Strides, which chronicles the success of the roughly 150 small schools in Chicago. So they've certainly recognized that size matters, and that good teaching most frequently happens in small schools, where teachers can work together, where they can hold each other accountable, and where they can hold students accountable. You can create an authoritative environment in a small school that's virtually impossible to create in a large school. Mr. Regula. Did you get an opportunity to testify in the authorizing committee? They were doing a bill that we have on the Floor now. Mr. Vander Ark. Mr. Chairman, as a foundation we don't advocate for particular appropriations or bills. So no, I didn't. Mr. Regula. Well, from what you're saying, Mr. Obey, the ability of this Committee to support a small school program would be inhibited by the lack of authorization in the new bill. Mr. Obey. Well, what I'm saying is that the authorization bill repeals the specific authorization. We have, in the past, on this Committee found ways, by using general authorizations, to accomplish purposes that are constructive, and I hope that we can find that in this instance as well. I think it's a strange argument that some people make--that no effort is required on the part of the Federal Government because the Gates Foundation is involved. That seems to say, let cousin Johnny do it, rather than me, when we all ought to be working on it together. Mr. Regula. Well, thank you for coming. I'm in total agreement with what you're saying. I've been seven years in public education and on the State school board. I think this trend of bigness is better is just being demonstrated as not the right way to go. Have you developed any paper on this subject, to support what you've presented this morning? Of course we have your testimony. Is there anything additional to that? Mr. Vander Ark. Mr. Chairman, we have several articles on this subject. My testimony includes references to a number of the research studies that have been published in the last four or five years. I'd also call your attention to the Dropout Commission that made their report on January, Commission on the Senior Year, which made their report in February, the American Youth Policy Forum, which published their report earlier this year, the Education Trust, all of those organizations have come out very strongly in favor of small schools, and all of those reports cite many of the same pieces of research that are noted in my testimony. Mr. Regula. What you're saying is that in the thoughtful establishment, this is the direction that the research is taking? Mr. Vander Ark. There's very strong momentum among people that are looking at data. Unfortunately, that conversation has not reached most local school districts. Mr. Regula. I think we'll need to be creative. Mr. Obey. Well, I think that's allowed in the democratic system. [Laughter.] Mr. Regula. Thank you very much for coming. I commend you for your work, and I hope you have ever greater success. Mr. Vander Ark. Thank you. Mr. Regula. Because I think it's absolutely the right way to go. ---------- Tuesday, May 22, 2001. NIH WITNESS ERIC S. LANDER, CHAIR, JOINT STEERING COMMITTEE FOR PUBLIC POLICY Mr. Regula. I understand, Dr. Lander, you're on a tight schedule. So we'll give you an opportunity to be heard at this moment. Mr. Lander. Thank you very much, Mr. Chairman. Mr. Regula. Your testimony will be in the record and we'll welcome a summary. Mr. Lander. Great. Mr. Chairman, members of the Subcommittee, thank you for inviting me here this morning to testify. My name is Eric Lander, I'm a professor of biology at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology and the Director of the Whitehead Institute/MIT Center for Genome Research. I'm here today representing the Joint Steering Committee for Public Policy, which is a coalition of scientific research societies that jointly represents about 25,000 research scientists nationwide and globally. My own scientific research is related to the Human Genome Project. Our own center at the Whitehead Institute was the largest of the contributors to the recent sequencing of the human genome, and in addition, we work on trying to apply this knowledge to dissect the basis of human diseases, the causes of cancer and diabetes and heart disease. The scientific community is tremendously grateful for the support of this Committee and of the Congress in increasing the funding for the National Institutes of Health over the past several years. The additional funding is having a major impact on the pace of biomedical research, and it's been responsible for much of the remarkable scientific progress that we read about on a daily basis. I'm here today to ask you to continue increasing that support toward the goal of doubling the NIH budget. Given your own history of support for biomedical research, I take it for granted that you consider funding the NIH to be a tremendously important investment in our children's future. And I take it for granted that you know that millions of Americans suffer from Alzheimer's disease and arthritis and cancer and chronic lung diseases and diabetes and heart disease. And I take it for granted that you know that such diseases pose an incalculable burden of pain and hardship on its victims and their families, as well as a financial burden estimated approaching $1 trillion annually. But this alone would not be enough to justify substantial increases now. Substantial increases now can only be justified if two things hold. First, that there really are extraordinary and urgent new opportunities that justify additional investment. And two, that there's confidence that additional investment can be used well. And you have every right to demand answer to those questions, and I want to provide them. Number one, what are these new opportunities and what's so urgent them anyway? Mr. Chairman, there is an extraordinary revolution now underway. The revolution is most apparent in such landmarks as the Human Genome Project, which has given us the parts list for human medicine, the inventory of 30,000 or 40,000 human genes. This is having a dramatic effect on medicine. It's the equivalent of being able, for the first time, to have a look under the hood of the car to see what's wrong. One of the most uncomfortable facts about medicine in the 20th century is that for most diseases, including heart disease, diabetes, hypertension, depression and schizophrenia, we have had no clue what the actual cause is, the molecular mechanism of the disease. So we've been shooting in the dark. We've mostly been treating symptoms. Sometimes we get it right, but often it's a matter of luck. In the past decade, we've begun to see real progress on discovering the mechanisms, the causes of disease. Let me give you an example of what happens when we know the mechanism. Ten days ago the FDA granted swift approval to a new cancer drug, Gleevec, directed against a kind of leukemia called Chronic Myelogenous Leukemia. It was a new kind of cancer drug: it is non-toxic and taken orally. Of 53 patients who had failed conventional therapy and were expected to die of their disease, 53 had remissions. Moreover, the drug is now turning out to be effective against other cancers for which it wasn't even designed, including a kind of stomach cancer. Some people call this a miracle, and in many ways, it is. But it's no accident. It resulted from a dogged effort to understand the cause, the mechanism of leukemia. First, the recognition that two chromosomes were consistently rearranged in this cancer. Then the discovery that a novel gene caused by this chromosome rearrangement produced an errant protein locked in the on position. Then the proof that this protein, this errant protein, was absolutely essential for the cancer cells to grow. All this was the product of NIH funded research, through the foresight of this Congress. Once the mechanism was known, talented chemists in the pharmaceutical industry stepped in and created a drug to block this errant protein, and without side effects. Mr. Chairman, it's the difference between trying to fix a car when you have no idea what's wrong and between trying to fix a car when you can look under the hood. And this is not an isolated story. Ten years ago we had no idea what the mechanism was of Alzheimer's disease. Since then, we've been able to look under the hood and find key causative mechanisms. And it's led to an explosion in drug development. I believe that we will see drugs emerge that can prevent Alzheimer's disease before symptoms occur, that is, prevention of diseases, rather than dealing with the devastating consequences. This could only happen by knowingthe mechanism. Similar stories have emerged for Parkinson's disease and other diseases. We're standing on the threshold of what I think is the greatest revolution in the history of medicine. We're now set to work out the mechanisms underlying most common diseases that afflict people. And it's an audacious program to imagine that this could happen, but I believe it will happen in the next one to two decades. But it's going to take major and increased investment now. I think the investments were justified. We finally have the tools to lay bare the secrets of disease, and I think we'd be failing the American people in general and our children in particular if we didn't seize the opportunity. If we delay investment today, we delay understanding, we delay therapies and cures. I think this is a very special moment in history and we need to seize it. Number two, how can this Congress be sure that the increased investment is being used widely? That is, how can you monitor the progress? Some years ago, this Congress passed the Government Performance and Results Act, GPRA. What performance and results should you be monitoring? Well, the development of new drugs and therapies that stemmed from NIH is one such measure. But it's a long term measure, because it can take a decade or more for understanding to translate to therapy. Instead, I would urge you to focus on the discovery of mechanisms. Keep a scorecard of how we're doing at discovering the mechanisms. That's the key, because you can feel confident that if we reveal the molecular mechanisms, it will unlock the prodigious energies of industry and academia to fashion therapies and cures. In this way, you can be sure that the investments are reaping dividends. You can also look at new initiatives at NIH, such as the newly established NIH Center for Minority Health, which is a sign that we're working together to ensure that biomedical research benefits all Americans. Number three, finally, Mr. Chairman, I know it's not the purview of this Committee, but I would like to add that for all of this to succeed, we need increased investment in other areas of science as well. Increased investment in biomedical research will not reap its full potential unless we have corresponding investment in physics, chemistry, computational science, etc. These allied disciplines are absolutely essential. For example, for figuring out what protein shapes and functions are about, or for developing non-invasive imaging to speed clinical trials through the study of early markers of disease. The President's budget for biomedical research is very encouraging. But I'm deeply concerned that the budget for other sciences is neglecting key investments. In summary, this is no ordinary time. The science of the last century has now brought us to an extraordinary threshold of understanding the basis of disease, and it is time for extraordinary investment to reap those benefits. Thank you for your consideration, and I'd be glad to answer your questions. [The justification follows:] [GRAPHIC(S) NOT AVAILABLE IN TIFF FORMAT] Mr. Regula. Thank you. Mr. Obey. Mr. Obey. Well, I want to thank you very much for your statement. It's not the first time that I've heard you, but I'm very happy that you focused on our obligations beyond NIH. I've said this before, but I'll say it again very frankly. There is a member of the Subcommittee that was prepared to vote for at least the President's budget on NIH. It's become the holy picture item in the health budget. We all pose for political holy pictures by stumbling toward the nearest microphone to say how much we're dedicated to NIH research. The problem is two-fold, as I see it. First of all, this big investment in NIH, according to the budget, will stop after 2004. Because then the budget estimates don't contain the 15 percent increases any more, the increases drop to low single digit levels, accurately reflecting what will be available in the budget as this tax cut that's being passed continues to drive everything else off the table. The other problem that we have, as you have indicated, is that if all we do is fund NIH and don't deal with NSF and some of the other seed corn agencies, we are going to cut the plant off at its roots. The flowers may look pretty for a few days, but they won't last that long, at least not in the health we'd like to see them. This isn't really a question. It's just a statement of philosophy. I think that we have a once in a generation opportunity, now that we have surpluses instead of deficits. We have a choice to make between tossing almost all of those surpluses at the private sector in the form of individualized realizations of happiness through tax cuts, or we can try to reserve a major part of those surpluses, I would hope by far the largest part, to finally enhance the quality of public services and the strength of public investments that must by nature be a collective enterprise rather than an individual enterprise. I think we're about to blow the biggest chance we've had in a generation to really make a difference, not just for medical research, but in a number of other areas as well. I thank you for focusing not just on NIH, but also on the other near orphans in the scientific community, given the squeeze that we have on those agencies. Mr. Lander. Thank you. We can't deliver on the promise without a full picture of the support it will take. Mr. Regula. Thank you for a thought provoking testimony. Mr. Lander. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. ---------- Tuesday, May 22, 2001. TEACHERS WITNESS C. EMILY FEISTRITZER, PRESIDENT, NATIONAL CENTER FOR EDUCATION INFORMATION Mr. Regula. Our next witness is Emily Feistritzer, President of the National Center for Education Information. Your testimony will be made part of the record, we welcome your comments. Ms. Feistritzer. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. I'm the President of the National Center for Education Information, which is a private, non-partisan research organization in Washington. I started the National Center for Education Information just to fill what I thought was a gap of a need for collecting, analyzing and reporting objective and unbiased information. So we really don't take a position on these matters, but we take great pride in the kind of data that we've been able to make available. I thought I was going to follow the gentleman from the Gates Foundation and I wanted so much to do that, because so many things he said fit right into this changing market for teaching and alternative routes for bringing people into teaching. But I wanted to share with you, before I get into my statement, in a book that we do called Alternative Teacher Certification: A State by State Analysis, which I will make available to the entire Committee, in the introduction we have a section on schools in the nature of how schools are organized in this country. One of the bulleted items states that at the high school level, only 3 percent of all secondary schools in this country enroll 1,500 or more students, and yet they account for 33 percent of all enrollment. It just reinforces what Mr. Vander Ark said. Forty-one percent of schools enroll fewer than 400 students, and yet account for only 18 percent of all students. So we're really talking about a relatively small number of schools throughout this country that enroll the proportion of all the students who are enrolled in schools. This is very much related to the whole issue of teacher supply and demand, which is the topic that I was asked to speak with you about. We've all heard that we're going to need to 2.2 million additional teachers in the next decade. You could have a whole hearing with probably 25 witnesses to just debate what that actually means. But the fact of the matter is, the demand for teachers is increasing, not decreasing. But it's actually not increasing everywhere. The demand for teachers is really isolated in certain regions of the country, namely large inner cities and in outlying rural areas of the country. And in certain subject matter areas, such as science, mathematics and special education. We find that actually, the Nation nationally is turning out enough people to teach. The colleges and universities that prepare teachers in this country are producing roughly 200,000 brand new, never taught before teachers each year, and that's more than enough actually. The problem is most of the people who are coming through colleges of education fully qualified to teach don't want to teach where the demand for teachers is greatest. Undergraduate teacher education programs historically have turned out young white females who do not want to teach in large inner cities and who do not want to move actually very far away from home. Now, what we find also is that in the National Center for Education Statistics data from baccalaureate and beyond studies, that about 60 percent of baccalaureate degree recipients who are fully qualified to teach are not teaching the following year, and only about 53 percent of them are not teaching five years out. So we have a production of teachers in this country that is great enough to meet the demand. The problem is that the production of teachers is not satisfying the demand, because the demand is, as I said earlier, isolated and quite specific to geographic regions and to specific subject areas. That's why this new movement toward States developing alternative routes for recruiting, training and licensing teachers makes so much sense. Because not only have alternative routes evolved since the mid-1980s and grown rapidly since the mid-1990s, it is because not only are they meeting the demand for additional teachers in specific areas of the country, they are also meeting the demand created by the supply of people who are stepping forward to want to teach who do not fit the traditional definition of a teacher, which is a high school student going to go college and majoring in education. We find that there are huge numbers of what I call non- traditional candidates for teaching, people who already have a bachelor's degree, usually in a field other than education, many of whom have life experience, some of whom have been in other careers and retired, who really do want to teach. And they really do want to teach in areas of the country where the demand for teachers is greatest. And alternate routes are being developed all over the country to specifically recruit these people to teach in these ares of the country where the demand is greatest. And the Federal Government, in its infinite wisdom, has been through the authorizing language and through this appropriation moving in the direction of providing some much needed support of the development of these types of programs. I see that my formal time is up, so I'll stop here. [The justification follows:] [GRAPHIC(S) NOT AVAILABLE IN TIFF FORMAT] Mr. Regula. I'm curious, is the multiplicity of requirements, and it varies from State to State for certification, is somewhat of a barrier to the people you characterize perhaps who have had other careers and would like to teach, but suddenly they're faced with going back and taking a couple of years of how-to courses, is that a problem? Ms. Feistritzer. I think it is a problem. You can't ask people who have finished their degrees, in some cases masters degrees and some cases professional and even more advanced degrees, to give up employment and go back to college and pay tuition to take courses required for certification and may or may not be able to find a job. So that is a problem. That's why the alternate routes that are designed specifically to attract this population of people and are developed to train that population of people to teach in the very schools that most traditionally trained teachers don't want to teach in make an awful lot of sense, and are being met with a tremendous amount of enthusiasm from mid- career changers and military personnel and so on. Mr. Regula. Mr. Obey. Mr. Obey. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. As you know, last year we were able to provide $34 million in the budget for non-traditional teacher recruitment activities. And $31 million of that was based on the Transition-to-Teaching Initiative. What's your evaluation of that program? Ms. Feistritzer. I have testified before the authorizing subcommittee, and I'm very much in favor of that. I think that the States really do need financial support in developing these programs. Most of the programs that are springing up around the country are really on the backs of the participants in the program. They can be very costly to the individual who's trying to get a credential to teach. So I think the transitions to teach program, in the current budget, is an excellent program. My only caution, I was around during the block grant era of Chapter II in the early 1980s. I saw a lot of really good programs, like teacher centers and teacher corps really get lost in the block grants. And I think that, I have a problem with turning all of this money over to the States to do with as they will. I would hope that there would be some guidelines that these monies be used for such things as the design and implementation of alternative certification routes, for example. Because I'm not sure the States will wind up using it for that if they can get away with using it for something else. Mr. Obey. How about the Teach for America model? Ms. Feistritzer. Teach for America is really a recruitment effort for recent college graduates to make a two year commitment to teaching. I like Teach for America a lot. I like Troops to Teachers an awful lot. But those two programs are specifically recruitment efforts for specific populations of people. The alternative teacher certification arena is much broader and much bigger and encompasses a whole lot more people and has more potential, I think, for bringing in wider audiences of people in a way that fits with the current bureaucracy of American education, which is not likely to change in our lifetimes. Mr. Obey. I would just have to say that in light of your other comments about block grants, that I'm fascinated. One thing that fascinates me is that there are a number of people in Congress and out who will criticize the degree of educational attainment of students in the country. And they will say, we just aren't doing very well at all. So their answer is to turn even more authority over to the people who already have the lion's share over running schools, namely the local school boards. I don't think my district is much different than anybody else's, local school boards make 95 percent of the decisions about how kids get educated and where they get educated, who they get educated by and where resources go. It's always fascinated me that the Federal Government, which really is only nibbling around the edges in terms of the financial support it gives education, somehow gets the blame for the lack of performance in schools that are largely governed by local school districts. I think you have to conclude that that judgment is not based on evidence, but it's based more on ideology or philosophy. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. Mr. Regula. Has there been any movement on the part of States to remodel their requirements for certification to make it easier for these transition type of individuals? Ms. Feistritzer. We survey the State departments of teacher ed and certification every year. And the results of that are published here. There's been a lot of movement in that direction. I am more encouraged, I've been covering and around education all my life, I'm a third generation educator. And I'm actually more optimistic than I think I've been throughout my life about the future of the teaching profession for this single reason, that the population of people who are stepping up to the plate sincerely wanting to teach is radically changing, positively. And the States and even the institutions of higher education are being, I think, very positively responsive to using it as an opportunity to design some really good, sensible, not a whole lot of courses and riff-raff, but really sensible, field based mentor companion teacher preparation program for life experienced adults. Forty-one States now say they are doing such a thing, but they need a lot of support. Mr. Regula. Has the NEA and/or the AFT been a help or hindrance, or are they neutral on this whole effort? Ms. Feistritzer. The NEA and the AFT both, to their credit, have been back in the early 1980s, rather silent on the issue and increasingly open to the development of good new alternative teacher preparation programs. They've not gone as far as sitting here before you, calling for $1.2 billion for them. But they have been increasingly, I think, open to the development of collaborative alternative teacher preparation. Mr. Regula. That's a positive note. Thank you for coming. Ms. Feistritzer. Thank you. Tuesday, May 22, 2001. STUDENT FINANCIAL AID WITNESS BRIAN FITZGERALD, STAFF DIRECTOR, ADVISORY COMMITTEE ON STUDENT FINANCIAL ASSISTANCE Mr. Regula. Brian Fitzgerald, Director, Advisory Committee on Student Financial Assistance. Your statement will be made part of the record, you may summarize, please. Mr. Fitzgerald. Thank you, Mr. Chairman, Mr. Obey, for the opportunity to present an overview of the Advisory Committee's most recent report entitled Access Denied: Restoring the Nation's Commitment to Equal Educational Opportunity, a copy of which is in your materials today. For the record, my name is Brian Fitzgerald, I'm staff director of the Advisory Committee. I will deliver testimony on behalf of Dr. Juliet Garcia, who is President of the University of Texas-Brownsville and Chairperson of the Advisory Committee. She is ill today and apologizes for not being able to be here herself. Our committee was authorized by Congress in the Higher Ed amendments of 1986, to provide expert, independent, objective advice to Congress and the Secretary on Federal student financial aid policy issues. The committee's most important legislative charge is to make recommendations that maintain access to post-secondary education for low income students. Over two years ago, the committee began a comprehensive examination of the condition of access, that is the opportunity to attain a baccalaureate degree. At three public meetings devoted exclusively to access, the committee was informed by testimony of dozens of students, college administrators and scholars about the financial as well as the academic, social and cultural dimensions of access. Emanating from those activities and a parallel two year study, the Access Denied report marshals the most authoritative data to pinpoint the access problem and its causes. The report documents the wide gap between available aid, including loans, and college costs for low income students. This gap, known as unmet need, is $3,200 a year at two year public colleges and $3,800 a year at four year public colleges. Significant enough to lower the rate at which low income students enter college, attend four year institutions and attain a bachelor's degree. More than 30 years ago, the Federal Government entered into a partnership with States and higher education institutions to ensure that all Americans could have access to a college education without regard to their economic means. As a result, tens of millions of Americans who otherwise would not have had access to college have attended and earned associate's and bachelor's degrees. This highly successful effort increased the rate at which Americans enter college to record levels, which has fueled this Nation's economic growth. Unfortunately, the post-secondary participation of low income students continues to lag far behind that of their middle and upper income peers. Large differences in college entry rates persist, with gaps as wide as three decades ago. In addition, a recent U.S. Department of Education study indicated that low income students who graduate high school at least marginally qualified, enroll in four year institutions at half the rate of their comparably qualified high income peers. Equally troubling, only 6 percent of low SES students earn a bachelor's degree, as compared to 40 percent of high SES students. These facts have major implications not only for the lifetime earnings of low income students, but it also robs the Nation of hundreds of billions of dollars a year in gross domestic product. Yet the challenges that face low income students today in gaining access to college will worsen considerably as a result of impending demographic forces. Rivaling the size of the baby boom generation, the projected national growth of college age population by 2015 exceeds 16 percent or about 5 million, with at least 1.6 million additional students enrolling in college, many of whom will be low income. Thus, even if college costs continue to grow no more rapidly than family income, these demographic changes will greatly increase the gross amount of financial aid required to ensure access. Unfortunately, financial barriers are higher now in constant dollars than they were three decades ago. The unmet need gap facing low income students has reached unprecedented levels, once again, $3,200 and $3,800 respectively at two year and four year public institutions. This includes all work and loan. Given these levels of unmet need, the failure to close the participation and completion gaps is not surprising. Unmet need is forcing low income students to choose levels of enrollment and financing alternatives not conducive to academic success, persistence and ultimately degree completion. One often hears the argument that poor academic preparation is the primary reason for low income students' lack of access. That is simply not true. Inadequate financial aid, that is the unmet need gap, often prevents the most highly qualified low income youth from attending college at all. In fact, the lowest achieving high income students attend college with the same frequency as the highest achieving poor students. If my committee members could leave you with only one message today, it would be this. The inability of tens of thousands of academically prepared low income students to enroll in a four year institution, attend full time and earn a bachelor's degree is the result of unmet need just as it was 30 years ago, and portends no narrowing of participation gaps, even in the long run. No matter how strong the Nation's commitment to academic preparation, no matter how quickly academic preparation advances, no progress can be made toward improving access without increases in need based grant assistance starting with the Pell Grant program. Thank you, Mr. Chairman and Mr. Obey. I would be happy to respond to any questions you have. [The justification follows:] [GRAPHIC(S) NOT AVAILABLE IN TIFF FORMAT] Mr. Regula. Thank you. I have just one. On the Pell Grants, which would you think would be more effective, have a larger amount the first year with a decreasing amount the second, third and fourth year, or have a flat amount for four years as part of a Pell Grant program? And some of the colleges have indicated they have to end up picking up the difference where it drops off in the second, third and fourth year. Do you have an opinion on this, which would be the better way to do it? Mr. Fitzgerald. Mr. Chairman, we looked not only at the ability of students to enter college, but the most important thing is that students must be enabled to persist and obtain a degree of their choosing. We feel that giving higher grants in the first year or first two years may have a slight impact on the number of students enrolling, that is to say, it may increase. We are very concerned that it may actually harm persistence, and put colleges in a position, and many of them serving the lowest income students will not be able to do this, but put colleges in a position where they have to make up the difference. Mr. Regula. So you'd prefer a flat amount for four years? Mr. Fitzgerald. That is correct, Mr. Chairman. Mr. Regula. Mr. Obey. Mr. Obey. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. I would simply note that, the reason why low-income students don't attend college in the numbers that we would like them to is very easy to understand, when you recognize that in 1975 the Pell Grant maximum award, as a percentage of the cost of going to college, was 84 percent, and today it's 39 percent. I don't think it takes a rocket scientist in order to figure out that that's a major reason why much smaller numbers of low- income people attend college than would be the case if we really, truly had equal access to education. This country is great at myths. We always talk about equal justice under the law, and liberty and justice for all in the pledge of allegiance. But when you take a look at performance, if our words were to match what we're actually doing, the pledge of allegiance would be amended so we say that we're providing liberty and justice for almost everybody, but not for all. That's all, Mr. Chairman. Mr. Regula. There have been some allegations that college tuition tracks with whatever we do with Pell Grants. Any validity to that? When you look at the numbers, it would appear that might be the case. Mr. Fitzgerald. Mr. Chairman, although our report does not specifically deal with college costs, I think there's been a good deal of emphasis on college costs recently. We've examined that very carefully. We find no relationship whatsoever to the level of Pell Grants and college costs. Congress created a commission on college costs to look at that. The fact of the matter is, the number of Pell Grant recipients is a relatively small number, it's a minority among students enrolled in college. So if Pell were driving college costs, you would be, for example, I believe you are on the board of trustees at Mount Union---- Mr. Regula. Right. Mr. Fitzgerald. I was just look at the data, I don't know what the enrolment is, I'm sort of backing into it. But there are three times as many loans as grants, as Pell Grants, at the college. If Pell were driving tuition at your college, you would be in effect taxing non-Pell Grant recipients when they are no better off as a result of rising Pell Grants. In fact, the majority of students attend public institutions, about 80 percent of all students. Those tuitions are set by a public governance process unrelated to levels of Federal and often unfortunately, State aid. And in key States, California, Massachusetts, Virginia, tuitions have declined, 20 percent in Virginia in 1999-2000. So frankly, I think the concern about college costs is actually, the jawboning, if you will, has led college leaders to look very carefully at that and frankly make a very concerted effort to even lower tuition. That is going to change, though, with the decline in State subsidies. Mr. Regula. Yes, we're having that in Ohio because of the budget constraints. Mr. Kennedy. Mr. Kennedy. All the talk about Pell makes me very proud to come from Rhode Island. And of course, Pell didn't pioneer the Pell Grant without understanding the importance of what it meant to my State and all the institutions of higher learning in my State. I know from hearing from them, having gone to a number of graduations this past weekend and talked to the boards of directors at the different public institutions, they're all very concerned about what's coming down the road in terms of funding for higher education and assistance from the Federal Government. So I welcome your concerns and advocacy on behalf of financial aid to students. We certainly need it now more than ever, because as we all know, higher education is the key to opportunities for the future. So thank you. Mr. Regula. Mr. Obey. Mr. Obey. Mr. Fitzgerald, I'd just like you to repeat one sentence that you uttered earlier. You said the lowest achieving high-income students attend college at the same rate as the highest achieving low-income students? Mr. Fitzgerald. That's correct, Mr. Obey. It's 78 percent of the highest achieving low-income students go to college, and 77 percent of the lowest-achieving high income students. The inescapable conclusion is that money matters. Mr. Obey. You bet. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. Mr. Regula. You made your point very effectively. ---------- Tuesday, May 22, 2001. EDUCATION WITNESSES PETER HORTON, ACTOR, THE CREATIVE COALITION AND COMMITTEE FOR EDUCATION FUNDING CAROLYN HENRICH, PRESIDENT, COMMITTEE FOR EDUCATION FUNDING Mr. Regula. Mr. Peter Horton, from the Creative Coalition and Committee for Education Funding. You're accompanied by Carolyn Henrich, President of the Committee for Education Funding. We're happy to welcome you, your testimony will be made part of the record, and we'll welcome your comments. Mr. Horton. Thank you very much. Good morning, Mr. Chairman and Congressman Obey, members of the panel. On behalf of the Creative Commission and the Committee for Education Funding, I would like to thank you for letting us speak on such an important topic. I think all of us in this room would agree that education of our children is a foundation stone, if not the cornerstone, for building and maintaining a healthy and prosperous society. My name is Peter Horton, as you stated. I am an actor, director, writer in the film and television business, as you also stated. This is Carolyn Henrich, President of the Committee for Education Funding. Mr. Chairman, I think I'm going to take your advice and not read my full written statement into the record. I can feel the room slowly wilting as we go along here, and with the exception of a couple of points, facts, I would like to share, I will then take another tack. One of the facts in my written statement is that the Federal investment in education has actually declined as a share of the Federal budget from 2.5 percent in 1980 to 2.1 percent today, which means that we are spending only two cents of every Federal dollar on education. Now, the groups that I am representing today are advocating a five cent expenditure, which certainly to me seems reasonable, at least. There's just a couple other quick facts. At the elementary and secondary level, enrollments are projected to set new records every year, reaching over 54 million by the year 2006. Over the next decade, college enrollments are expected to continue to grow another 11 percent, with one in five students coming from families below the poverty line. And then the last one, which truly shocked me, which is that 30 percent of our students live in poverty in this country, in this Nation. Mr. Regula. Thirty percent in the public schools live in poverty, is that correct? Mr. Horton. Yes, sir. It's shocking. Mr. Regula. It is. Mr. Horton. I think what I would like to do for the balance of my time, if you don't mind, is really speak to you from my heart. If I can, I would like to try and explain to you why I'm so passionate about this issue, why I think it's so important that you provide adequate funding for education in this country. I went to public school my whole adolescence and childhood. My sister Ann is a school teacher. One of my heroes growing up was a woman named Jo Egger Lundquist, who is an extraordinary educator up in the northwest, who believes that teaching is not a profession but a calling, which I believe and concur with completely. But most importantly, what's affected me the most on this issue is I recently became a father for the first time. As you know, becoming a father for the first time changes your whole outlook on things, your whole perspective on the world. I am facing a situation in Los Angeles where, for me to get adequate education for my daughter, I have to be willing and able to spend $15,000 a year for her grammar school education, and $10,000 for kindergarten. Now, there's a significant portion of this country that makes $10,000 to $15,000 a year in salary, and an even larger group that's making more than that but still can't afford that kind of expenditure for education. I don't know what we tell them. I don't know how we explain that to their children. My family and I spend a lot of time in a small community in California called Cambria. It has 5,000 students and the public school there is so overcrowded that a lot of the classroom work has to be done in the halls of that school. Now, recently a number of, or two education bond measures were up for a vote in that community, and both failed. Now, this is a community where neighbors know each other, they know the children that they're voting against. I don't know how to explain to those children why they still have to use the hallway as their classroom. Now, you are the only body in this country that has the ability to set a national standard of education for this country, a bar if you will, under which no student, not my daughter, not any student, will fall. We're spending two cents on a dollar. It used to be two and a half cents, it's now two cents. We need at least five cents. And that's not just my opinion. As I'm sure you know, polls indicate a vast majority of Americans feel like spending five cents on education is something they can support wholeheartedly, in fact are asking you to do something about that. I mean, we are the wealthiest country in this planet. And we're going through one of the most prosperous times in our history. We can afford five cents. We can afford the nickel. Thank you for your time. [The justification follows:] [GRAPHIC(S) NOT AVAILABLE IN TIFF FORMAT] Mr. Regula. Mr. Obey. Mr. Obey. Thank you for your testimony. I think you're right. I would put it another way, I don't think we can afford not to provide that nickel. I would just note two things. My wife started out at the time she married me, as a speech therapist. She used to work with kids in a hall closet, because that's all that the school system provided, in one of the schools that she taught. I never dreamed that 30 years later, you'd still have the same conditions. I was silly enough to believe in the improvability of a society on a consistent basis and in so many ways I've been proven wrong. The other point I would simply make is that you indicated that we've actually seen investments in education going down as a percentage of our national budget. I would point out that we've seen our investments in everything go down as a percentage of our national income. If you take a look at all of the dollars that the Appropriations Committee can provide in the budget this year, and if you compare that to what we were spending in 1980, this country was spending 5.2 percent of our total national income in 1980 on all domestic initiatives of the Federal Government except for entitlements. That's not counting programs like Social Security. Today we are at 3.4 percent of our total national income. And within five years, under the budget that Congress has just adopted, we will be down to 2.8 percent of our total national income. We are shortchanging education. We are shortchanging science. We are shortchanging health care. We're shortchanging environmental cleanup. We're shortchanging all of those collective enterprises that represent the fundamental responsibilities of people to each other in this society. And that's what makes this budget this year so incredibly frustrating. Mr. Horton. I would say also, I think the way we treat our children as a Nation is sort of the canary in the cave. It's our best indicator of our integrity as a Nation. I would say, our best focus right now, our most necessary focus right now is to make that statement as a Nation, that our children are worth at least five cents on the dollar, and the rest up to you. Mr. Obey. Well, again, all I will say is that over the last five years we've had an average annual increase in federal education appropriations of about 13 percent. Mr. Horton. Yes. Mr. Obey. This year, the President's budget cuts that rate of increase in half when you compare apples to apples, program delivery versus program delivery by academic year. Some progress. Thank you. Mr. Regula. Mr. Kennedy. Mr. Kennedy. Thank you. It seems to me that the big challenge we have as a Nation is to get these facts that you've just mentioned out and in the public consciousness. But not only that, there has to be a will, because we know more today than we ever have in our history about brain development and the impact of violence on children long term in terms of their learning. We know all these things, and yet we are treating our kids worse than they've ever been treated in the history of the Nation. So even during times of the Depression, kids were, according to historians and child development specialists, were essentially treated better because of the nature of family and attentiveness to children than they are today. It says something about the fact that it isn't just simply knowing more. We as a society believe that if we just had more information that would do it. It's not enough. It's a culture of change that has to take place for us to embrace this increase. So all I can say is that it takes a fundamental political change of heart. I think those that have advocated a reduction in Government spending insofar as the collective enterprises that Mr. Obey was talking about have been doing so by denigrating government and tearing down our public institutions and saying that you can't be trusted, politicians can't be trusted, our whole democracy is failing you, the public. And if you say that enough, people will believe it. And what they have come to believe is that that's true. Unfortunately, when they believe that that's true, there isn't the confidence to support these programs, and the public will to support these programs. So we need to change the ethic in this country that looks upon government and political leaders as the lowest form of life, and start changing the civic ethic in this country in terms of public institutions. So I can just say, I wholeheartedly appreciate what you're saying, and I do agree that we're becoming two separate societies as a result. What comes to mind is John Kenneth Galbraith's book, Private Wealth, Public Squalor. We're going to have a lot of people that have the wealth, and then we're not going to have any infrastructure in this country that everyone can share. It's not going to be a pretty sight, we're going to become a banana republic of sorts, an oligarchy, which is essentially what we're becoming now. So I think the disparity in income and wealth has never been greater in our country's history. It's an absolute travesty that we don't have public policy that reflects a newer view of where investments need to be made in education, because that is clearly the correlation between a good education and a person's ability to get a good job. It'sjust so direct. So how we can not look at that as a civil right, and if you deny that person a good public education, essentially they should be able to sue under the Fourteenth Amendment for denial of their civil rights. So I'm in agreement with you and I hope that you're successful in helping us change the public culture in terms of this. And certainly I acknowledge the fact that Hollywood has a great deal of influence in shaping our culture to the degree that folks like yourself can take a leadership role. I think that's really constructive and I appreciate it, and I really applaud your efforts. Mr. Horton. Thank you. I think one last brief thing. From the beginning of civilization, there's been a balancing act between the need of the community, the good of the community, the good of the individual. A healthy society has a very even balance. I think you here in Washington set that tone. Mr. Regula. I appreciate your testimony. I have to say, I read a disturbing article over the weekend from the Los Angeles Times. The headline is, after spending $2 billion, Kansas City schools get worse. A judge in Kansas City, Missouri ordered the schools to spend a lot more money. And he ordered the State government to come up with the money. They did spend the $2 billion, on top of everything else. And their scores are down now. Admittedly they didn't do well. It says, 900 top of the line computers, an Olympic size swimming pool, with six diving boards, I don't know exactly how that makes you a better scholar, padded wrestling room, etc., etc. I think we have to be careful, and I support more funding, but I think we also need to say what works. Because it's obvious that in Kansas City, $2 billion did not improve. In fact, they're going to take the system away, apparently, and turn it over to the State and/or the mayor. It says the new approach, back to the basics. I would hope this Committee has time after we've finished our regular hearings to have some oversight on what really works. How do we make sure the money we do spent causes an improvement in the system and the education of young people? I think that's part of the challenge. Mr. Horton. I agree with that. I clearly agree with that. I think, though, if you go back to Jo Egger Lundquist's statement that teaching is a calling, I think it's important. Mr. Regula. That's true. Mr. Horton. And I think we have to start treating teachers with that respect. I think yes, in any endeavor, there is going to be anecdotal evidence that says, this didn't work over here. And maybe that anecdotal evidence is a good reason to take a look at the system, try and make sure that we're functioning well in that system. Mr. Regula. Leadership, it says in Kansas City they've had 20 superintendents in 30 years. That tells you a lot right there. Mr. Horton. There you go. There's the problem. But I don't think that means we should not fund it. Mr. Regula. Oh, no. No, I'm more interested in how we can make sure our funding gets results, and that's exactly what you're saying, that's what all of us here want. Just as an aside, you have many credits as an actor. I see you were in the Into Thin Air, Death on Everest. Mr. Horton. I was. Mr. Regula. Did they film that there or here? Mr. Horton. I wish we could say we braved the elements and went all the way to Tibet, but we did it in Austria, which is sort of like Tibet but not really. [Laughter.] Mr. Horton. I think the food in Tibet would probably be better, actually, than it was in Austria. Mr. Regula. Very interesting. This was a TV series? Mr. Horton. A TV film, yes. Mr. Regula. That was a takeoff on the book? Mr. Horton. Yes. Mr. Regula. I read the book. Mr. Horton. The book was terrific. Better than the TV show, I have to admit. [Laughter.] Mr. Regula. Thank you for coming and for your interest. Tuesday, May 22, 2001. DEPARTMENT OF LABOR BUDGET WITNESS RICHARD TRUMKA, SECRETARY-TREASURER, AFL-CIO Mr. Regula. Our next witness will be Mr. Richard Trumka, the Secretary-Treasurer of the AFL-CIO, on labor issues. Thank you for coming. We'll put your testimony in the record, and you can summarize for us. Mr. Trumka. Thank you very much, Mr. Chairman. I'll do just that. Mr. Chairman, Congressman Obey, Congressman Kennedy, on behalf of the 13 and a half million working women of the AFL- CIO, I appreciate the opportunity to address some of the concerns the President's fiscal year 2002 budget raises for working families. Of particular interest and importance are proposals for key worker protection, work development and international labor programs. Those are the three that I'll focus on. Many of these programs, in our opinion, are already inadequate to fully protect the rights of working people here at home. Program cuts and flat funding will dilute these protections even further, with the impact harshest for the very workers who need most of the protections. If current economic weakening persists or worsens, these effects will be magnified. For workers in the global economy, program cuts undermine our capacity to promote workers' rights and fight child labor and other abuses, efforts central to ensuring that trade improves the living standards for all, rather than undermines the protections for America's working families. We ask you to bear all these concerns in mind as you consider the President's proposal for 2002. And I'll briefly talk about three of those areas. Worker protection. For 2002, the President proposes flat funding for the Employment Services Administration, which enforces the Nation's wage and hour laws, and for OSHA. These translate out into a $6 million cut in ESA and an $11.5 million cut in OSHA. We think this is the wrong approach. Violations of basic wage and hour requirements remain pervasive, especially in low wage industries. In the poultry industry, for example, a DOL survey in 2000 found wage and hour violations in virtually every surveyed establishment. Similar problems exist in garment manufacturing, where one DOL survey found violations in two-thirds of establishments in Los Angeles, agriculture and industrial laundries and many other traditional low wage industries. They even exist among workers in the modern economy, such as Silicon Valley immigrant workers who assemble circuit boards at home on a piece rate basis. The President's ESA funding proposals threaten the Department of Labor's oversight of working conditions and enforcement of work protections for all of these workers. Proposed funding levels for OSHA also threaten that agency's capacity to ensure workplace safety and health by cutting 94 full time staff positions, two-thirds of which come from enforcement, and by reducing funding for standard setting and worker safety training. In sum, the funding proposals for key worker protection programs concern us greatly. At a time when a Nation can afford to do so much, we should be investing more, not less, in protecting workers' rights. In job training, Mr. Chairman, the fiscal year 2002 budget would cut over $500 million in training and employment services, including reductions in adult, youth and dislocated worker programs, the latter having been targeted for a 13 percent reduction. Ironically, the President proposes to boost funding for the unemployment insurance system to handle an expected increase in claimants at the same time that he wants to cut back on retraining and reemployment programs that would help the unemployed return to work. We're also deeply troubled by the proposal to eliminate national funding for incumbent worker training. It's unrealistic to expect State and local programs to pick this up, this funding slack up, unless the needs of other workers, including the unemployed and the disadvantaged, are to be sacrificed. On the international labor program side, the President's proposals for DOL international labor programs in 2002 is $71.6 million. That's less than half of the 2001 budget of $148 million. It's especially ironic that the President is calling for such steep cuts at the same time that he is trumpeting those programs as the preferable alternative to trade agreement provisos as the mechanism for ensuring international labor rights. The cuts proposed by the President would seriously, seriously reduce the Nation's capacity to combat child labor around the world, to provide child laborers with basic educational opportunities, to support workplace HIV and AIDS programs targeted at youth, to promote the ILO declarations of the fundamental principles and rights of work and promote workers' rights around the world. Mr. Chairman, we believe these cuts are misguided and will undermine the efforts of American workers to compete in the global economy. We ask this Subcommittee and the full Committee to keep the needs of working families in mind during your budget deliberations and to fund adequately the important worker protection, job training and international labor programs on which many families in this country so deeply depend. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. [The justification follows:] [GRAPHIC(S) NOT AVAILABLE IN TIFF FORMAT] Mr. Regula. Thank you. Your testimony is timely, we have the Secretary of Labor this afternoon before this Committee. Mr. Obey. Mr. Obey. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. Mr. Trumka, I would simply make one observation and ask one question. In this tax bill that's working its way through the Congress, the cost of providing tax cuts over the next 10 years to persons making more than $200,000 a year--the cost of refusing to limit the size of their tax cuts to about $7,500 just from the rate cut alone--is about $280 billion over 10 years. We're going to toss that kind of money at them. Yet, we're being told that we have to cut the Dislocated Workers' Program appropriation by 13 percent and international labor programs by 50 percent. Would you explain what these international labor programs do? Would you explain how they work and would you explain why they're needed? I find it interesting that an Administration that is about to ask Congress for additional authority in the trade area is making a 50 percent cut in the program that is meant to cushion the blow of globalization on American workers because of their increasing vulnerability to products that are produced with either slave labor or child labor. Would you explain why these programs are not trinkets and why they are crucial to the average working person? Mr. Trumka. In short, the answer to that question is, these programs allow us to identify the most outrageous actions that take place around the world, whether it's child labor, whether it's forced labor, and allow us to correct them in one form or another. To not correct them causes American employees and American employers to compete with products in the global market that are made and subsidized and actually reward this type of child, prison, convict labor or forced labor. The other things allow us to monitor work places, for instance, to find out abroad who is complying with their labor laws and who isn't. We have tried for a significant amount of time to get workers' rights as part of every trade agreement, because it's our belief that workers' rights should be elevated to the same level as intellectual property rights. We've been unsuccessful to date. Each and every time we're told that we should look to another forum. And the forum that is always pointed to is the UNDILO. This cut actually slashes in half the program and takes any resemblance of seriousness that that claim can make away. No one, if this budget is passed with this type of funding, no one can seriously say to an American worker, you should go elsewhere to protect your rights, you should go elsewhere to look for help for a Mexican worker or Chilean worker or Brazilian worker, you should go elsewhere. Because this flies in the face of that argument. Then when you look at things like AIDS and HIV, all of those affect us on a moral basis and on an economic basis. The spread of AIDS-HIV has been a horrible thing that all of us want to eliminate. And we tried that, particularly with you, and particularly in some of the African nations, it's a very serious problem. But it's growing elsewhere. This would hamper our ability to do that. The other thing this would do is, we were successful in getting a few people, 17 I believe, around the world to work in embassies to identify outrageous workers rights and to promote workers rights in those areas, so that they could increase their standard of living, so that laws were either enforced, or if they were inadequate, we as a person in the global economy could say they were inadequate, change the laws so those workers have a real chance to participate in the global economy. All of those programs directly impact people here, whether it's in the Trade Bill directly with TAA assistance, whether it's competing with child labor, whether it's competing with people at forced labor, whether it's competing with Colombians who have workers truly assassinated. In one of the coal mines of Colombia, the president and vice president of the local union were being bussed from the home to the work site. The bus was stopped, they were taken off the bus and both of them were assassinated, shot directly in the head as a message to everybody else that if workers stand up for their rights, this is the fate that befalls you. We're forced to compete against a society that uses that threat to lower their prices and to avoid any resemblance of honest, fair treatment and dignity in workers. Mr. Obey. I think that's an eloquent statement. I think it will be a cold day in hell before the average worker in this country will be willing to support further trade agreements, so long as he sees programs like this that are meant to provide them barely minimal protection being shredded by their own government. Mr. Trumka. We would very much like to be able to support those trade agreements. But we would like for those trade agreements to be fair to workers on both sides of the border. And when we're told to go to the ILO, and then first of all, we don't adopt here at home any of the ILO standards that protect workers and then the meager funding that there is is slashed in half, I think it speaks forcefully to the American worker about, is that truly an avenue, or is that just a convenient way to deflect us. This truly highlights and makes it irrefutable that that avenue is a means to deflect us, not to protect our rights. Mr. Obey. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. Mr. Regula. Thank you. Thank you for coming. Just off the record, you were in mining, did you work in the mines? Mr. Trumka. Yes, I did, seven and a half years. Mr. Regula. Open pit or what type? Mr. Trumka. Deep mines in southwestern Pennsylvania. And Mr. Chairman, it's been my experience, when there's a downturn in the economy that the first place that employers, particularly mining employers, attempt to cut is in the health and safety area. Mr. Regula. Yes. Mr. Trumka. If you look at the last time, we had a downturn in both of our States. Mr. Regula. Right. Mr. Trumka. You saw that the downturn was preceded by a rash of belt line fires, people being killed, people being crippled and lost production facilities. At a time when our country needs as much energy as we can get, I think that's the wrong thing for us to be advocating. Mr. Regula. I was curious, my dad was a farmer, but he was also involved in a drift mine. I used to go back in there, and the closest I ever got to a pony was that animal that pulled the cars out to dumping tipple. So that's kind of a dangerous business, when you get right down to it, the point that you make. And I see, in China they've trapped a large group of miners. There's always that threat. Mr. Trumka. It's horrible what's happening, the lack of mine safety in China, the lack of safety in the workplace in China. Mr. Regula. Do you get any opportunity to communicate to countries like the Chinese, some decent standards and ideas on safety? Mr. Trumka. It's difficult, because as you well know, the representatives that they send to all the international events that are supposed to be worker representatives are really not worker representatives. So we talk to them about health and safety. We have American companies that attempted to go over there one time and create mining, but they've never caught on to the notion that the value of a human life was more important than a pound of coal. Mr. Regula. Well, thank you very much for your testimony. ---------- Tuesday, May 22, 2001. COMMUNITY HEALTH CENTERS WITNESS PATRICIA DIETCH, PRESIDENT AND CEO, DELAWARE VALLEY COMMUNITY HEALTH, INC. Mr. Regula. Patricia Dietch, President and CEO, Delaware Valley Community Health. Thank you for coming. Your statement will be put in the record, we'll appreciate your observations. Ms. Dietch. Thank you, Mr. Chairman, Mr. Obey. I'm Patty Dietch, I'm as you said, President and CEO of Delaware Valley Community Health in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania. I'm happy to be here today to represent the National Association of Community Health Centers and the millions of patients who get their medical care in health centers across the country. I want to start by thanking Congress and this Committee for your past support and let you know how much it's appreciated, that the past increases that have been awarded to community health centers have not gone unnoticed by those of us who try to keep them going and those of us who work in them and by our community boards and the patients who get their care there. I'd like to take a moment to tell you about how some of those past increases are used, from our experience. In 1999, Congress awarded a $94 million increase for community health centers. My organization applied for and received an expansion grant. And we moved into a suburban, actually an affluent suburban county, a suburban county of Philadelphia that has, their county seat is an old industrial town that has a lot of poverty pockets, economically depressed, because most of the industry had left the town. We identified a group of mostly minority low income patients who had very poor health status indicators and little or no access to health care. So we received this grant, and we projected that we would approximately serve about 1,600 patients. In the first year alone, we had 2,200 patients, over 7,000 medical visits. These are people who are working poor, who work in service jobs, in restaurants and landscaping, temporary construction jobs, 7-11, people who work but work in low paying jobs where they don't have employer sponsored health care plans. As a matter of fact, 83 percent of the people who come to the center do not have health insurance. These people, because they haven't received medical care in a long time, some of them 10 years, are very expensive to work up and treat. They require a lot of diagnostic tests, they have multiple problems that when you first get them, it takes a lot to get them managed, people who would have probably waited until they got catastrophic illnesses and went to the emergency room. So this center, by everyone's measure, has been a success. I think that you'll see opportunities for that all over the country. So far this year, there's 100 applications that have been received to expand health center sites, and almost 500 that have been submitted to add services to existing sites. Even the $150 million increase that we received last year, only half of these applications could be funded with that increase. And this year, we're starting in a new position for us, the President has made health centers a priority, and both President Bush and Health and Human Services Secretary Thompson have been very supportive of community health centers. The President has pledged to double the number of patients served by health centers over the next five years. And also, he has called to increase the number of new sites by 1,200 in 2006. Last year, health centers served over 11 million. Forty-two percent of them have no health insurance. Although already, health centers are the most efficient and effective providers in the country, serving each patient for just over $1 a day. When I learned that statistic, I did my own health center and we're actually below that. So I was pretty proud of that. In order to double the number of patients served over the next five years, NACHC has calculated that next year, health centers would have to serve an additional 1.65 million patients. If you add that up, that's a cost of $175 million increase. I understand that this is an ambitious goal that the President has set, and we're ready to meet it, how and ever we can. We continue to see an increasing number of uninsuredpatients in our health centers. In my organization in the last five years, the percentage of uninsured has grown from 11 percent to 43 percent, just since 1996. And now with the spotlight placed on the program by the President, I expect we will see more uninsured patients finding health centers and increasing our patient loads. Mr. Chairman and Mr. Obey, I work at health centers because I'm really committed to serving those less fortunate and to ensure that all people have access to high quality primary health care, and they really receive it at health centers. I think it's unparalleled, the kind of care that they get. We're extremely pleased with the President's call to double the number of patients seen in health centers in the next five years, but it's going to be difficult to achieve if the funding, the dollars say that even this year we're going to need $175 million just to start to get there over the five years. So that's what we're here to say, is that we appreciate your support and it's been greatly appreciated by the millions of people and those of us who keep these centers open every day. Thank you. [The justification follows:] [GRAPHIC(S) NOT AVAILABLE IN TIFF FORMAT] Mr. Regula. I think they are great programs. Mr. Obey. Mr. Obey. You say that the President has made funding of community health centers a high priority. I'd like to examine that statement a little bit. Last year, as you know, we provided an $150 million increase. Even with that, only half the applications were funded. Now the Administration is proposing an increase, not of $150 million as we had last year, but $124 million. I told the story in this Committee a week ago about a woman I met about two months ago who was not fortunate enough to live in an area where they had centers. I went to announce the creation of a dental clinic in this four-county low-income area. I met a young woman who was on Medicaid. Only about half the dentists in those four counties would even take Medicaid patients. And those who did take Medicaid patients would take no new ones. She had a child who needed to have the braces removed from his teeth. She looked for a long period to try to find a single dentist who would take those braces off. After calling 30 of them, she could find not a one. So she held the kid down while the father took the braces off with a pair of pliers. How many more health centers could be provided, and how many more people could be provided service, if the President's budget this year provided the same dollar increase that we had in the budget last year, namely $150 million rather than $124 million that's in the President's budget? Ms. Dietch. Well, I'm not sure I can do this math in my head, but $175 million would be 1.6 million additional patients. So a little over a million more patients for $150 million, 1.2. Mr. Obey. We have 40 million Americans without health insurance. At that rate, it will take about 40 years before we can get them covered by health centers, right? Ms. Dietch. That's true. Mr. Obey. Probably every member of this Committee and this Subcommittee will be pushing up daisies at that point, Mr. Chairman. Mr. Regula. Yes, probably. Mr. Obey. Thank you. Mr. Regula. Thank you for coming. I'm curious, is your pin of significance to community health centers? I sort of thought it might be, given the configuration? Ms. Dietch. No, I'd like to tell you that it is, but it was really just a gift from someone where I left a former job, and she bought it in a department store. It didn't come from Colombia, I probably should make up a better story. But it's really true. Mr. Regula. It indicates people helping people, and our reliance on each other. Ms. Dietch. Yes, and they're multicultural. Mr. Regula. That's very much what a community health center is. Ms. Dietch. Absolutely. Mr. Regula. A lot of volunteers, people helping people. Ms. Dietch. Actually, and a lot of usages of other Federal programs. My organization participates with the Senior Reemployment, the Older Americans Act, we have seniors who are trying to re-enter the work force come to us as volunteers, we've hired a couple of them, AmeriCorps, I mean, we utilize a lot of people. Mr. Regula. I think it's a great program. I hope we can do more. Ms. Dietch. Thank you. ---------- Tuesday, May 22, 2001. PUBLIC HEALTH WITNESS ANTHONY ROBBINS, M.D., CHAIR, DEPARTMENT OF FAMILY MEDICINE AND COMMUNITY HEALTH, TUFTS UNIVERSITY SCHOOL OF MEDICINE Mr. Regula. Dr. Anthony Robbins, you get the blue ribbon for patience this morning. I'm sorry we couldn't get to you sooner, but as you can tell, there was a lot of testimony. You're the Chairman of the Department of Family Medicine and Community Health--where, it doesn't tell me. Dr. Robbins. I'm sorry. It's at Tufts University in Boston, Massachusetts. Mr. Regula. Okay. And you want to talk about public health. Dr. Robbins. I'd like to talk about public health. I spent most of my career in public health, in government, State and Federal. Actually before I go to the core of my statement, perhaps I could just say to you how sad it is to be in front of this Committee without Silvio Conte here. He was a great advocate for public health and we miss him. The President's budget that you're considering today is problematic for efforts to improve the health of Americans. I want to make just two key points and then a lot of the illustrations are in my written testimony and we can go to those questions if you'd like. Expansion at NIH has great merit. But to expand NIH alone is shortsighted public policy. It's already clear that many Americans are not in a position to benefit from scientific advances in medicine and public health. The budget will increase the likelihood that under-served citizens, the elderly, the needy, and rural Americans will never benefit fully from NIH research. As we saw last week with the introduction of this new leukemia drug, when we rely on commercial firms to exploit research results borne of Government investment, lifesaving products may be beyond the financial reach of many Americans. Investment at NIH must be balanced with full drug coverage under Medicare and expansion of health programs to help the under-served. And that point really refers particular to the programs of HRSA and to the programs of the Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration. That's point one. The second point refers to how public health works in our Federal system, where protecting the health of the public is principally in the domain of States. But we have wisely built federal programs that now provide the critical glue that holds State public health efforts together. Any weakening of the Federal public health programs will be far more damaging than the reduced Federal budget numbers might indicate. State and city programs will not be able to provide adequate protection for their people against tuberculosis, lead poisoning, or asthma, for example. We in New England, where we've been dealing with the West Nile virus problem will probably not have the resources we need. If you look at the history of this, since the Michael Debakey Commission on Heart Disease, Cancer and Stroke reported in 1965 that the benefits of biomedical research were not reaching all Americans, the gulf between investment and research and the application of the results has actually widened. Since that time, there is a wide body of evidence that early detection and intervention can reduce the burden of illness and disability on our aging population. As a consequence of our failure to assure the broad distribution of health advances produced by NIH research, many Americans, particularly the poor, those who live in rural areas, and the elderly, become sick and disabled and die unnecessarily. Two health agencies of the Department of Health and Human Services, HRSA and SAMHSA, define their mission in terms of improving health and services for under-served Americans. To the life saving programs of these two agencies the President's budget would inflict serious damage. Then in the written testimony I describe what happens in the community access program and the rural health program, the Bureau of Health Professions, Maternal and Child Health Block Grant and Ryan White, poison centers and the mental health grants to communities. I follow a witness who has spoken about the increase of 10.6 percent for the community and migrant health centers. And the President is to be commended for that. But that represents only a small part of the overall HRSA budget which would decline overall, including the increase for health centers, by 10.4 percent. At SAMHSA, the targeted capacity program to which a small amount of money has been added isn't growing nearly rapidly enough. The agency itself estimated that 2.9 million people are left out in terms of getting services from this program, from these targeted areas. Yet the budget would cover 17,000 new people or only .06 percent of what the agency says is needed. Now, let me go to the Centers for Disease Control and sort out the constitutional issue that States retain the prime responsibility for protecting and improving the health of their people. State health departments delegate some of their responsibility to city and local health departments. I used to, when I was a State health officer, first in Vermont and then in Colorado, I was always reminding the Feds, as we called them, that we in the States have the prime responsibility. But in truth, in modern society, threats to health have outgrown the capacity of State and local health departments to respond without Federal help. Pathogens and toxic chemicals cross borders. People cross borders. And public health responses must as well. The Federal Government has responded very well historically, with important assistance, help in gathering data and surveillance, laboratory supportto stay ahead of threats to health, and would help building capacity and purchasing power, and help developing new programs where the science has made it possible. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention have grown to become the critical Federal public health assistance program. Yet CDC's overall programs are being cut back in a number of areas. The chronic disease and health promotion program would be cut back by $174 million in the proposed budget, cutting back on cervical and breast cancer screening, heart disease and stroke, the diabetes program and many others. There's new technology that is finally letting us look at environmental hazards by seeing how people are exposed. Yet the Center for Environmental Health would see a diminution in its budget. Vaccine purchases, which have become a very important part of Federal assistance to States, I guess it goes up a little bit, but the fact is that the cost of vaccines to vaccinate one child fully will almost double next year because of the addition of a wonderful new vaccine that comes out of NIH research. The pneumococcal vaccine, which is effective against one of the major causes of meningitis, and the blood borne pneumococcal infections in infants, costs a lot of money. And the new budget does not incorporate enough funding to continue to cover the same number of kids with these vaccine purchases. I mentioned asthma, where we have a national epidemic and where in fact we're finally getting a handle on it, and yet that program is cut back. And finally, the Prevention and Health Services block grant is reduced. I urge you, and maybe this is another one of those cases where creativity will be needed, but I urge an expansion in the health programs in the rest of the Department of Health and Human Services, especially CDC, HRSA and SAMHSA, comparable to that that has been proposed by the President for the National Institutes of Health. Let me conclude with a story. About 25 years ago, I was a brash young State health officer, State health commissioner in Vermont. I joked with the head of our appropriations committee in the State house of representatives, and I told him that the budget that he was proposing for me, that there wasn't a heck of a lot I was going to be able to do about a variety of avoidable problems, and that I might just have to sit back and name the outbreaks and epidemics after the members of the committee. Now, Em Hebard was really very supportive and used my joke, I guess, to help bring the budget up to a reasonable level. I guess I would conclude by hoping that you can do as well by my colleagues in the Public Health Service and for the people of the country. Thank you. [The justification follows:] [GRAPHIC(S) NOT AVAILABLE IN TIFF FORMAT] Mr. Regula. Do we get to pick our disease? Dr. Robbins. Oh, I guess so. [Laughter.] Mr. Obey. Tony, good to see you. Just a couple of questions. First of all, would you expand on what this new PCV vaccine? Would you give us a little more information about what would happen in terms of numbers of kids who would actually be covered by all the vaccines they need if we stuck to the President's budget? How many kids are going to be left out? Dr. Robbins. Well, I can only, I can guess---- Mr. Obey. Why is it important? Dr. Robbins. Let me go back to the vaccine, because this is a very good story. We have had in the last 20 years three major vaccine successes. All the other vaccines are older than that. But first there was the hepatitis B vaccine and now hepatitis A vaccines. These were developed out of research efforts and brought to market and included in the universal vaccine programs. The most magnificent success was the hemophilus influenza B vaccine, where essentially this disease, which was the most common form of meningitis in children, virtually disappeared in this country. Now we're succeeding similarly in the rest of the world. The most common remaining cause of meningitis in young children is streptococcal pneumoniei, the organism that causes pneumococcal meningitis. And interestingly enough, the old vaccine that was effective in adults has been around for a long time. It was developed many, many years ago and the technical advance was producing something that would make it immunogenic, would produce an immune response in children. When that was done, they then had to produce a vaccine that covered seven different strains of pneumococci. And in doing that, this became a very expensive vaccine, sufficiently expensive so that I'm told that next year's price, this vaccine will cost as much as all the other vaccines together have been costing under the CDC purchase program. That meant in effect, if you were just going to keep the same number of children protected you were going to have to double the allocation. I think, if I remember the numbers, it's up by $73 million or about a third of the increase that would be needed to keep pace with immunization. CDC provides by bulk purchases, by making contracts with the vaccine manufacturers, I believe it's 11 States, 6 in New England plus 5 others that buy all of their vaccines for all of their children, and then the other States which buy a smaller number for the under-served, for the uninsured. This has become critical to every immunization program in the country. These programs are essentially surveillance, so you know where you've got the disease and you know how good the coverage is, organization so that you make sure that everyone is coming into health centers and health plans to be immunized, and the support of certain personnel and the purchase of vaccines. They've been magnificently successful. Mr. Obey. Thank you. I noticed in public polling, Mr. Chairman, that there's a strange gap in the public understanding of the Public Health Service and the public health agencies. When you use the term public health, what many, many Americans think you're talking about is health care delivered to the poor--Government health care for poor people. They don't realize that what the public health service does is to try to protect the health of the entire American population from serious diseases. I think if we could just find a way to make that change in people's heads it would be a whale of a lot easier to get support for some of these programs. Dr. Robbins. I'm even reminded that when you go into building one of NIH that the plaque on the wall describing the mission of the institutes includes public health. It is not simply to produce products and advances for the medical care system. That's the problem for the under-served and the poor. As we get new advances, it makes it to us, they make it to us middle class people. But without the HRSA program, without the kind of emphasis on screening and advances for diabetes treatment that CDC is pushing so effectively now, this doesn't make it to the under-served portions of the population. Mr. Obey. Thank you. Mr. Regula. Thank you, and we appreciate your patience. Very worthwhile information. The subcommittee will be in recess until 2:00 o'clock. Dr. Robbins. I should thank the staff, because I've been where you are, and you stuck it out, too.
