What exactly your therapy and leisure program will be depends on the respective facilities and location. An Ayurveda detox retreat by the sea often offers combination options with meditative beach walks. A detox vacation in Kerala, India, can include exciting boat rides across the backwaters or nearby sightseeing. If, on the other hand, your spa facility is located in the mountains, mountain hikes and visits to local spas promise wonderful complementary spa content. Also beautiful yoga locations are often located in close proximity to Ayurvedic spa facilities. You can always rely on special comforts such as an attractive wellness & spa area, excellent food by healthy Ayurvedic meals and therapeutic guidance by expert staff. Also in Germany or Europe, you will be treated by experienced therapists who have undergone several years of training, not infrequently in India or Sri Lanka. "}
