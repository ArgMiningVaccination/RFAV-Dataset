I was pretty uncomfortable about stopping some of my supplements. You kindly spent extra time with me and carefully suggested what was truly needed. Not everyone would have done that, but you took the time to take extra care in helping your patient. That's what makes you such an exceptional doctor and individual. So, I want to make sure that you know how grateful I am to have you as my doctor. \" - J.E. August 2023 \"Hi Dr. Ledenac, I saw you in the Spring of 2019 for chronic IBS/low energy. We ran through a lot of tests and an eventual SIBO diagnosis and treatment plan, along with supplements to address my blood work deficiencies. Shortly after our few visits together, I ended up moving out of the area (DC -> NYC!) and did not get a chance to follow up with you before my move.I am reaching out to extend the greatest thank you I possibly can. It's been a year since I finished SIBO treatment, along with consistent supplementation, and can happily and confidently say my symptoms have not re-occurred whatsoever since beyond the occasional stress flare. You helped me to get my life back; I came to you when my quality of life was at such a low. I can't express my gratitude enough to be in the position I am one year later without a single symptom I initially came to you with. You heard me out and listened to me in a way that I struggled to receive from every doctor I had seen prior, and I appreciate that more than anything.I've sent as many people as I can in the DC area your way and to the GW Integrative Medicine practice in general. Hoping you are well & sending my best,\" - Isabelle K., July 2020 \"Dear Dr. Ledenac, Thank you for the incredible difference you continue to make in my life; your loving kindness, your exceptional wisdom and your talented medicine are just to name a few of your extraordinary traits that I am most grateful for.\" - L.J., Jan 2018 \"With the help of Dr. Marianna Ledenac, I have cleaned up my diet, lost 10 pounds, have more energy in the morning and got rid of my morning brain fog! So happy and I feel like a new and younger person! Thanks so much!!!\" - C.R., October 13, 2016 "}
