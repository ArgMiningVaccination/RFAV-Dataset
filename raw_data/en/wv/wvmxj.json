A comfortable, calm environment may help people relax and focus on meditating. Although everyone's idea of an ideal space is different, the following tips might help: - Make the bed as comfortable as possible. - Have plants in the bedroom. - Maintain a clean and tidy space. - Use soft or warm colors and lighting. - Avoid using screens before bedtime. - Keep the room cool. - Use pleasant fragrances from scented candles and essential oils. - Stick to a regular sleeping and waking routine. - Reduce distracting noise. There is a lack of research into how environments affect meditation. However, Great Britain's [National Health Service (NHS)](https://www.nhs.uk/every-mind-matters/mental-wellbeing-tips/how-to-fall-asleep-faster-and-sleep-better/#4) notes that quiet and cool environments can [improve sleep quality](/articles/325303/). The same is true of a regular sleep routine. Learn about [good sleep hygiene](/articles/sleep-hygiene). There are several meditation techniques people can try in bed. Using a [meditation app](/articles/best-meditation-apps) can be useful for learning how to meditate. Meditation techniques include: Mindfulness Mindfulness meditation works to induce a present-focused and nonjudgmental headspace. It encourages people to focus on the breath and sensations in the body. It also involves observing thoughts and feelings without dwelling on them. Body scan A [body scan meditation](/articles/body-scan-meditation/) works by attending to different body parts, focusing on how they feel. The process is systematic, starting from the top of the head and ending at the tips of the toes. Progressive muscle relaxation [Progressive muscle relaxation](/articles/progressive-muscle-relaxation-pmr) works by tensing and then relaxing muscle groups. An individual can work through different muscle groups in a sequence, attending to the feeling of relaxation. Sound meditation In sound meditation, an individual focuses on external sounds. These might be nature sounds, chants, or singing bowls. The idea is that a person returns attention to these sounds if their focus starts to drift elsewhere. Breath awareness Breath awareness meditation involves paying close attention to the flow of breath. The individual attends to the rhythm, sounds, and physical sensation of the breath. Loving kindness Loving kindness is a Buddhist meditation technique, also called [metta](https://kripalu.org/resources/what-loving-kindness-metta-meditation?gad=1&gclid=CjwKCAjwh8mlBhB_EiwAsztdBOhWbfQmiguiKT8SldyELzGwY5L_4N1jA0OkVZXddpt0zK6FkYrwchoCRYwQAvD_BwE) meditation. It fosters calming feelings of compassion and love toward the self and others. Individuals can do this by repeating positive phrases. They can also imagine making positive statements about themselves and others. Guided visualization [Guided visualization](/articles/guided-imagery) works by following verbal instructions or by recalling images. These instructions or images guide the individual to imagine peaceful and relaxing scenes and scenarios. [Some practitioners](https://www.nimh.nih.gov/news/media/2021/guided-visualization-dealing-with-stress) Read more about [types of meditation](/articles/320392). Meditating in bed may bring all the benefits of meditation in a comfortable and convenient place. People may wish to adapt their environment to help them focus by using fragrances, adjusting the temperature, and lowering the lighting. Meditation techniques include mindfulness, body scans, and breath awareness. People may wish to try several techniques to find what feels good to them. "}
