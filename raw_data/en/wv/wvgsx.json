Risk owners have been asked to update curr ent mitigation and action plans . 1.3 The next formal review of the strategic risk and opportunity r egister will take pla ce in January 2022, and of the operational risk r egister in April 2022. 2.0 Strategic Risk and Opportunity Register - Monitoring Summary 2.1 Attac hed to this report at Appendix B is the updated strategic risk r egister. The register offers additional information including detail on Key Controls and Sources of Assurance and how progress against mitigation will be measured. Section 5 of the report provides information on the approach to scoring risks. 3.0 Strategic Risk Register 3.1 There are 17 risks on the strategic risk register , two of which have a risk rating of Red; these relate to the growing volume and complexity of demand on the Children, Y oung People and Families and Adult Social Care Service s. The risk s relating to financial pressures and the risk relating to the impact of insufficient pupil a ttainment has been reduced to an amber rating. All other risks have seen no change in the risk rating score, and no new risks have been added. The 'red risks' are shown below. Risk number one relates to the 'hidden harm' consequences of COVID -19 infection control measures and safe systems of work that are adding to existing pressures on the Children, Young People and Families service. The service is continuing to see a rise in children coming into care. Risk number two relates to workforce concerns and the growing fragility of the Adult Social Care Market that might lead to the inability of the Local Authority to meet statutory duties and meet eligible need. 3.2 Strategic Risk update table Table one provides an update on all 17 risks on the strategic risk register.

The risk to economic performance is a combination of the ongoing impacts of the coronavirus, Brexit, labour shortages , infrastructure challenges relating to material supply and general uncertainty in many sectors. Some of the long -term effects (especially without effective policy instruments) are likely to carry over in 2022 and beyond. The impact of COVID -19 on the eco nomy has been sharp and has affected different sectors of the economy in different ways. We are focussing, through Resurgam, on six areas to help our economy to recover, to protect local jobs and to support our communities. These are: - Spend 4 Plymouth - A massive focus on l ocal procurement for local jobs - Build 4 Plymouth - An ambitious capital programme and economic stimulus to support construction jobs, buildin g a better and greener Plymouth - Skills 4 Plymouth - Extensive new support for young people a nd retraining our workforce for future job s through our skills launch pad - City Centre Renaissance programme - support for our city centre and a regeneration plan - Resurgam Beacons - A focus on our future. We will seek to create new jobs in the blue and green economy. That is our amazing marine secto r and a new green deal for jobs - Sector Action Plans - a bespoke package of interventions led by the private sector for our 11 key sectors, building on our Resurgam plans and innovating and collaborating together though our newly established Sector Hub. Supporting our sectors whether th ey are in critical shock, stable, or capable of high growth. These sectors are: - Construction and the Built Environment - Creative Industries - Digital - Defence - Health and Care - Fishing - Manufacturing - Marine - Retail - Tourism and Hospitality 16 Amber Anthony Payne PLYMOUTH CITY COUNCIL OFFICIAL - Transport and Distributio n. We have also established the cross cutting theme of inclusive growth. Our aim is to 'build back better' , growing a prosperous economy that reduces inequality, is sustainable and truly serves the wellbeing of all of the people of Plymouth. 4 Ongoing COVID -19 rates (with potential for further peaks) affect city's recovery / reset plans. It is not yet clear what mitigations will be needed for us to live with COVID -19. There remains a high risk of further waves but the timing is not certain. Rates remain high and are likely to increase over the winter period. - Vaccination programme continues, with additional work to reduce health inequalities. This now includes the booster programme a nd the 12-15 year old programme - Local Outbr eak Management Plan revised and includes ability to respond to new variants of concern, as well as various mitigations (such as asymptomatic testing) , which will help the city to live with COVID - 19. 16 Amber Ruth Harrell 5 Failure to reduce Health Inequalities will mean our poorest residents continue to live shorter lives as well as more years in ill health. Mounting evidence that COVID -19 is having differential health impacts across communities, adding to existing health in equalities. This is through either the disease itself or the mitigations put in place. There is an ongoing impact of this due to the economic downturn. The primary role of the O ffice of the Director of Public Health (ODPH) and the Persistent action across the Council is required at many levels to tackle inequalities by addressing the wider detriments of health. The public health team and partners continue to work with employers (year one focus) and schools (year two focus) to influence healthier lifestyles. The team continues to embed and promote the national One You cam paign across the city. The 'five ways to wellbeing' has been adopted across the city as the single approach to improving mental wellbeing. The work that started in year five on 'people connecting through food' is ongoing with a number of new initiatives developed. The focus on arts, culture, heritage and health (using the Mayflower 400 commemorations) continued throughout 2020 and 2021. The Thrive Plymouth Network will re -start and continue to meet on a quarterly basis to ensure delivery of the programme. D iscussions are ongoing about Year Seven of the Programme , which is likely to focus on Trauma Informed. Evidence has been provided to the Health and Wellbeing Board on the risk of widening health inequalities and partners are working together to try to miti gate. The local Care Partnership priorities are being refreshed and include tackling 16 Amber Ruth Harrell PLYMOUTH CITY COUNCIL OFFICIAL Public Health Team in particular is now to try to manage COVID -19 in the city , therefore protecting most deprived communities from further negative impacts. inequalities. Both of these routes bring partners together to understand the issues and the steps needed to tac kle health inequalities in the c ity. In addition to this, to support the work of the Council's cross -party Child Poverty Working Group, a high level review of the evidence of the impacts of the pandemic on the mental wellbeing of children and young people has been carried out. As already stated, the primary role of the ODPH and the Public Health Team in particular is now to minimise the impact of COVID -19 in the city, therefore protecting most deprived communities from further negative impacts. 6 Increased and sustained pressure on Adult Social Care budget due to increased costs of providing care, growing numbers of people and increased complexity of need. As this is a statutory service and largest single budget it could have a significant impact on the Authorities overall financial posit ion. - Real time management information - Strong Reablement Offer - Established Review Programme - Commissioning Intentions and Commissioning Activity to develop new models of care - Budget c ontainment meetings in place - Brief providers around risks relating to CO VID-19 and infection control and safe system measures - Focus on reviews and reablement to right size packages of care - Emergency p lan to cover need to prioritise critical services. 16 Amber Craig McArdle 7 Insufficient pupil attainment to achieve economic / quality of life outcomes across secondary cohort . - Plymouth Education Board (PEB) (and sub groups) is being reviewed to strengthen education partnership - Strengthen S chool Causing Concern procedure - School improvement work will create a partnership of dis tinct interventions to drive im provement and raise achievement - Cause for concern meetings.

The work of the Plymouth Commission has been extended to focus on attainment for secondary aged pupils and school improvement. This has also focussed on the impact of the COVID -19 re sponse arrangements, and a survey of all secondary schools has been undertaken to inform priorities for re -engaging pupils in September. Schools are expected to have the capacity to offer immediate remote education for classes or groups who are required to self-isolate for a short period of time, or where there are local restrictions requiring pupils to remain at home. Schools are being offered a ca tch up premium of \u00a380 per pupil for most schools, to assist with programmes of learning to support pupils who require additional support. At this time, it is intended that subject to some adjustments to content and activity, in the summer 2021 , GCSE s, AS and A levels are all teacher assessed. 8 The Council having insufficient workforce capacity and resilience to deliver the required range of services to meet statutory obligations and administration priorities . - Develop online training programmes - Implementation of 'The Way We Work' programme (technology, information management, accommodati on) to enable t he right conditions for success - Review of senior structure - Review of business plans - Possible remodelling of services - Ongoing 1:1s - Working towards Gold Wellbeing at Work Award - Increase in number of Wellbeing Champions to 60 (from 44) - Implement New Ways of working and deliver Accommodation Strategy . 15 Amber Andy Ralphs PLYMOUTH CITY COUNCIL OFFICIAL 9 The Council not meeting its obligation to keep data secure by failing to adhere to Data Protection Act 2018 Regulations . - Roll out staff awareness training to all staff - Implement greater reporting consistency within directorates - Implement improved incident a nalysis within the Service Desk - Improved co ntract management with partners - Implement greater reporting consistency within directorates - Implement improved incident a nalysis within the Service Desk - Standardised breach management processes distrib uted to key staff - Implement compliance requirements into DELT business as usual - this is a work stream of the information management project - Corporate Privacy Notice complete, service specific Notices being finalised. 15 Amber Andy Ralphs 10 The Council not meeting its legal obligations regarding the health, safety and wellbeing (HS&W) of its workforce. - Agree substantive future working arrangements according to worker type - The Big Listen November 2021 - Delivery of 21/22 HS&W action plan - Taking action on future Government guidelines in relation to COVID - 19. 15 Amber Andy Ralphs 11 The Council is unable to fulfil its legal obligations regarding the safety of its citizens and service recipients . - Statutory p ost holders - Commissioning and service Improvement plans - Budgetary management - Revision of business plans . 12 Amber Alison Botham/ Craig McArdle 12 Departure from EU single market without a trade deal further decreases city economic output . - Continued regional engagement to maintain strong influence - Monitor proposed regulatory changes for service impact - Continue to act promptly on government guidelines when issued. 12 Amber Giles Perritt 13 Risk of failing to meet carbon reduction targets to reach net zero by 2030 . - Year 1 action plans have been completed for both C limate Emergency Action Plan (CEAP) and C ouncil Carbon Reduction Plan (CCRP) - Year 2 action plans for both CEAP and CCRP have been approved by Full Council (January 2021) 12 Amber Anthony Payne PLYMOUTH CITY COUNCIL OFFICIAL - Brexit, Infrastructure and Legislative Change Overview and Scrutiny Committee hav e received six monthly performance updates (October 2020 and March 2021) - Year 3 action plans for both CEAP and CCRP are timetabled in to Full Council in January 2022. 14 Risk of financial impact of delivering proposed changes to Waste Services as set out in the Government's Draft Environment Bill. The Council have partnered with the Waste Industry body 'Waste and Resources Action Programme' to jointly commission external support to assess the likely impacts and opportunities of the Environment Bill. The funding for this work has been wholly met by D epartment fo r Education, Food and Rural Affairs. The procurement of this work will complete by November 2021 with a final report due in March 2022. The scope of the work is as follows: - To understand the implications of, an d ensure the Council meets, the government's requirements as proposed in the Resources & Waste Strategy - To help inform the future design of the Council's household waste collection service and understand the implications in terms of reprocessing infrastructure - To understand the likely impact that changes to the current household waste collection service will have on the Council's recycling performance - To consider where operational efficiencies can be achieved whilst still delivering a service that meets the needs of its residents and al lows the Council to maintain high leve ls of customer satisfaction - To appraise whether existing waste management infrastructure and assets in Plymouth, and the surrounding area, are likely to be sufficient for future requirements; and if they are deemed not to be then to provide options to inform the Council's waste strategy and spatial planning. 12 Amber Anthony Payne 15 The Council's expenditure exceeds the resources available to meet that expenditure within the medium term financial plan (MTFP) period (2022/23 -2025/26). The Council has taken the following steps (1) to adopt a 5 year MTFP moving forward rather than a 1 year or 3 year model (2) to adopt a system of monthly financial reporting to D irectorate Management Teams, Corporate Management Team , and Cabinet and 12 Amber Brendan Arnold PLYMOUTH CITY COUNCIL OFFICIAL Quarterly to Full Council, with monthly consideration of directorate level financial is sues at each Scrutiny Committee In addition the Council has introduced a system of detailed monitoring of the delivery of savings targets so that a vie w is published monthly in Cabinet reports.

The risk relating to the Council 's failure to obtain the PSN (Public Service Network) compliance from the Cabinet Office has been downgraded from a red risk to amber. This is because the accreditation was achieved for 2021, having not been achieved in 2020. An action pla n is being put in place to ensure that failure does not happen again. Further details on the 'red risks' are shown in table two below. Table two - Operational Risk Register Updates - Red Risks only No. Description Mitigation Risk Score Current risk rating Risk Owner 1 Risk of loss of life, injury or property damage due to tree falling within the city and at Mount Edgcumbe. Ash dieback is now present in the city and Mt Edgcumbe and is affecting large numbers of ash trees, meaning they are more susceptible to shedding limbs. Ash is the third most common species of tr ee in Devon and represents 1000 s of the trees on land in the city. The disease is expected to infect over 90% of ash trees in the city in the coming years and therefore increases the risk to public safety an d damage to - Works ongoing due to large backlog of work - Initial assessment of Ash dieback and report issued - Tree Risk Management Review completed - Increased partnership working and share - Higher risk rating relates to Mount Edgcumbe and requirement for capital funding to deliver tree management plan - Plan for Trees Investment budget will need reviewing, profiling and reporting on by the end of year as spend is currently greater than forecast. We are now in a better position to be informed about likely costs as a full su rvey season has been undertaken - Still a case to be raising this at national level to ensure that costs to LAs are recognised by nationa l government , Department for Education, Food and Rural Affairs / Department for Levelling Up, Housing, Communities and Local Government and a plan/ funds provided. 20 Red Red since Oct 2021 David Draffan / Paul Barnard PLYMOUTH CITY COUNCIL OFFICIAL infrastructure , as well as having a significant impact on biodiversity and decreasing the city's canopy cover. 2 Inadequate Asbestos Management Arrangements - resulting in closure of buildings/services, legislation breach, potential litigation for health claims, failure of duty of care, poor corporate governance - Completion of the pilot of three buildings - Roll out of the MAC initiative to all remaining buildings - Management of the buildings, linked to P erson in Charge changes and take up within all risk areas . 20 Red Red since Feb 2021 Kim Brown 3 Risk of injury or incident from inadequate traffic management and segregation between pedestrians and vehicles at depots - Project works to address all aspects of site traffic flow and pedestrian segregation - Training programme to ensure that all employees, contractors and businesses operating on site understand the S afety Watch Observation Programme - Project Board to be initiated to ensure that all project works are managed as a coherent whole - Perimeter fencing to be installed around land fill site - Replacement of push walls in R efuse Transfer Station and green waste area - Assurance around environmental agency requirements for the monitoring of gases and leachate . 20 Red Red since Oct 2021 Philip Robinson PLYMOUTH CITY COUNCIL OFFICIAL 5.0 Scoring Guidance and Risk Matrix To ensure that a consistent scoring mechanism is in place across the Council, risks are assessed using the agreed criteria for likelihood and impact. Risk scoring guidance is shown below. Score Likelihood Threat / Risk 5 Almost Certain (80-100%) Is expected to occur in most circumstances Will undoubtedly happen, possibly frequently e.g. annually or more frequently Imminent/near miss For health and safety risk - one in 100 chance of the adverse event happening 4 Likely (50-80%) Will probably occur in many circumstances Will probably happen, but not a persistent issue e.g. once in three years Has happened in the past For health and safety risk - one in 1 ,000 chance of the adverse event happening 3 Possible (25-50%) Could occur in certain circumstances May happen occasionally, e.g. once in 10 years Has happened elsewhere For health and safety risk - one in 10,000 chance of the adverse event happening 2 Unlikely (10-25%) May occur only in exceptional circumstances Not expected to happen, but is possible e.g. once in 25 years Not known in this activity For health and safety risk - one in 100,000 chance of the adverse event happening 1 Rare (0-10%) Is never likely to occur Very unlikely this will ever happen e.g. once in 100 years For heal th and safety risk - one in a million chance of the adverse event happening Risk Impact (Severity) Score Impact Threat / Risk 5 Catastrophic Risk Risks which can have a catastrophic effect on the operation of the Council or service. This may result in critical financial loss, severe service disruption or a severe impact on the public. Examples: Unable to function without the aid o f government or oth er external a gency Inability to fulfil obligations Medium to long term damage to service capability Severe financial loss - supplementary estimate needed , which will have a catastrophic impact on the Council's financial plan and resources are unlikely to b e available Death (single or multiple) or work related diagnosis leading to death Adverse national publicity - highly damaging, severe loss of public confidence Significant public interest Litigation certain and difficult to defend Breaches of law punishab le by imprisonment Very significant exposure of public funds with funding being managed across organisations and complex reporting Very complex stakeholder community with new partnerships, collaborations and suppliers/stakeholder environment volatile or wi th significant external change factors PLYMOUTH CITY COUNCIL OFFICIAL Extensive use of leading edge, novel or innovative technology , which requires specialist management and external audit 4 Major Risk Risks which can have a major effect on the operation of the Council or service. This may result in major financial loss, major service disruption or a significant impact on the public. Examples: Significant impact on service objectives Short to medium term impairment to service capability Major financial loss - supplementary estimate needed , which will have a major impact on the Council's financial plan Extensive injuries, major permanent harm, long term sick Permanent/significant disability Major adverse l ocal publicity, major loss of confidence Litigation likely and may be difficult to defend Breaches of law punishable by fines or possible imprisonment 3 Moderate Risk Risks which have a noticeable effect on the services provided. Each one will cause a degree of disruption to service provision and i mpinge on the budget. Examples: Service objectives partially achievable Short term disruption to service capability Significant financial loss - supplementary estimate needed , which will have an impact on the Co uncil's financial plan RIDDOR (Reporting of injuries, diseases and dangerous occurrences regulations) or major injury Medical treatment required, semi -permanent harm up to one year Some adverse publicity, needs careful public relations High potential for complaint, litigation possible Breaches of law punishable by fines only 2 Minor Risk Risks where the consequences will not be severe and any associated losses will be minor. As individual occurrences they will have a negligible effect on service provision . If action is not taken, then such risks may have a more significa nt cumulative effect. Examples: Minor impact on service objectives No significant disruption to service capability Moderate financial loss - can be accommodated at head of service level Three or more day injury First aid treatment, non -permanent harm up to one month Some public embarrassment, no damage to reputation May result in complaints/litigation Breaches of regulations/standards Budget within delegation 1 Insignificant Risk Risks where the consequences will not be severe and any associated losses will be relatively small. As individual occurrences they will have a negligible effect on service provision. If action is not taken, then such risks may have a more significant cumulative effect. Examples: Minimal impact, no service disruption Negligible impact on service capability Minimal loss - can be accommodated at senior technical accounting level PLYMOUTH CITY COUNCIL OFFICIAL First aid injury Unlikely to cause any adverse publicity, internal only Breaches of loc al procedures/standards Budget within delegation and relatively small or within operational costs When assessing the risk, the highest measure identified in each table is the score taken to plot the risk level on the risk matrix. The risk ratings for each part of the assessment are multipli ed to give an overall ranking for each risk. The risk matrix uses a \"traffic light\" approach to show high (red), medium (amber) and low (green) risks.
