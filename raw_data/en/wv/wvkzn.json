What is sun poisoning, exactly? It's a term you may have heard at some point in your life\u2014maybe your mom or dad (correctly!) told you to \"put on sunscreen so you don't get sun poisoning!\"\u2014but if you're still not entirely sure what it is, don't worry, you're not alone. That's because sun poisoning is not an official medical term or diagnosis; rather it's a colloquial phrase that patients and doctors have defined by consensus more than anything else. (As a result, not every expert agrees on its definition.) The most common unofficial interpretation of sun poisoning is that it \"describes feeling physically unwell from a severe Shainhouse, MD](https://www.stayskinsafe.com/), founder of SkinSafe Dermatology and Skin Care in Beverly Hills tells SELF. Read on for expert advice on how to recognize, treat, and prevent sun poisoning (or a regular sunburn, for that matter).

Symptoms of sun poisoning\u2014which can last for a day or more, depending on how quickly you treat them\u2014vary widely depending on the severity of the sunburn, but can include the following: - Headache - Fever - Nausea and vomiting - Lethargy - Dizziness - Body aches - Dehydration What causes sun poisoning? \"Sun poisoning primarily happens from being out in the sun too long without [proper protection](https://www.self.com/story/sun-protection-mistakes), so you end up with a really severe sunburn,\" [Apple Bodemer, MD](https://dermatology.wisc.edu/staff/bodemer-apple/), associate professor of dermatology in the school of medicine and public health at the [University of Wisconsin-Madison](https://dermatology.wisc.edu/), tells SELF. \"Probably the most common way that it occurs is when people who haven't been in the sun a lot go for that winter-break beach vacation and forget to cover up or apply enough sunscreen on their first day out.\" If the sun is intense, one day can be all it takes, she says. \"Also, there are certain medications\u2014like Accutane, which we prescribe for treating acne, certain antibiotics, and topicals like Retin-A\u2014that are photosensitizing, meaning that they make you much more sensitive to the sun,\" says Dr. Bodemer. \"Hopefully, a doctor will have warned you of that when prescribing, but if someone isn't aware of it they can end up with severe burns much faster than they would normally.\" How do you know if you have sun poisoning vs. sunburn? You've likely experienced a mild sunburn at some point in your life: Your skin turns tender, warm, and perhaps red (depending on your skin tone) on areas of the body that weren't covered by either sunscreen or a physical block (like a hat or beach umbrella). Severe sunburn is associated with localized skin swelling, pain, and sunburn blisters, says Dr. Shainhouse. What are the signs of sun poisoning, though? Generally speaking, a severe sunburn tips over to sun poisoning when the symptoms you are experiencing also include headache, nausea, chills, fever, dizziness, lethargy, and/or weakness, says Dr. Bodemer. How does a bad sunburn turn into sun poisoning? A sunburn turns into sun poisoning when the shock of the burn triggers an intense immune system response in your body that results in the symptoms described above. \"A burn is like an injury to your skin. Your body reacts to that by releasing pro-inflammatory cytokines (proteins produced by cells) that trigger systemic symptoms like headache and nausea\u2014essentially, that feeling of being principal investigator with [International Dermatology Research](http://internationalderm.com), tells SELF.\u00b9 The UV radiation that causes the burning of your skin is also causing cellular damage, adds Dr. Bodemer, and when you have that much injury your body goes into overdrive (thanks to that inflammatory response we've been talking about) trying to repair it. [Dehydration](https://www.self.com/story/5-weird-signs-that-youre-dehydrated) can also play a part, says Dr. Barba. When you're exposed to the sun for an extended period of time, and your skin is hot from a burn, your body releases water and funnels it to the surface of your skin in an attempt to cool itself down. But if you weren't properly hydrated to begin with, or had been drinking alcohol, which is naturally dehydrating, getting badly sunburned can make it significantly worse, she says. Dehydration from severe sunburn can also lead to lightheadedness and weakness. When should you see a doctor about your sunburn? \"If you have a severe burn or a widespread area affected with fluid-filled blisters, are in pain, have the chills, and are feeling faint, you should probably go directly to an urgent care clinic or E.R. to get checked out by a doctor,\" says Dr. Bodemer. She and Dr. Barba note that depending on the severity of your burns and overall symptoms, and how dehydrated you've become, you may need I.V. fluids to rehydrate your body. Your doctor may also prescribe medication, such as oral or topical steroids and/or pain relievers to help bring down the inflammation and ease your discomfort. They may also recommend antibiotics to prevent infection. If you're feeling unwell but don't have fluid-filled blisters, you should still call your doctor's office, explain what's happening, and get their advice as to where to go or how to safely treat your symptoms, says Dr. Bodemer. Otherwise, if your symptoms don't seem extreme and you feel you can take care of things at home, you can follow the sun poisoning treatment steps below. What's the best at-home sun poisoning treatment? \"First, stay out of the sun\u2014no sitting by the pool or on the beach\u2014for at least the next 24 to 72 hours, depending on how severe your case is,\" says Dr. Bodemer. \"When your skin is burned and compromised to that degree, you're going to be much more susceptible to additional damage because your body's repair mechanisms are already overwhelmed. Stay inside if you can, or if you do go out, stay covered up. You need to give your skin a chance to heal and recover.\" Then, all the experts we spoke with agree: hydrate, hydrate, hydrate. [Drinking enough water](https://www.self.com/story/how-much-water-should-you-drink-a-day) will help your skin to heal and ease any headache, fatigue, or nausea. You should also cool down your inflamed, sunburned skin by soaking in a cool, not ice-cold, bath\u2014an extreme temperature change could tax your already hard-working immune system. \"You want to get the heat off of the skin in a very controlled manner, without shocking it even further,\" says Dr. Barba. If you don't like baths, a cool shower or cold compresses (just don't ever put ice directly on severely burned skin, as it can damage the tissue even further) should also help. To help manage pain and inflammation, take an over-the-counter anti-inflammatory medication like ibuprofen or aspirin, every six hours, says Dr. Shainhouse. \"You can also apply a thin layer of 1% hydrocortisone cream two to three times a day, which will also help reduce inflammation,\" she says. A gentle hydrating lotion can help moisturize dry, sunburned skin, and Dr. Barba also recommends [treating your sunburn](https://www.self.com/story/how-to-treat-painful-sunburn) topically with cooling, alcohol-free aloe vera gel. (Here are some of our favorite [sunburn relief products](https://www.self.com/gallery/sunburn-relief-products).) Can the sun make you sick without sunburn? Yes, some people actually have an [allergic reaction to the sun](https://www.self.com/story/sun-allergy) without experiencing any kind of sunburn. One such reaction is called polymorphous light eruption (PMLE), [a rash that shows up as tiny bumps](https://www.self.com/story/the-7-most-common-causes-of-itchy-red-bumps) or raised patches on the skin.\u00b2 They typically appear pink or red on lighter skin, and while redness can occur on darker skin as well, it may not be as noticeable. This condition is sometimes also referred to as sun poisoning or a sun poisoning rash. \"PMLE is basically an inflammatory reaction in the skin that's triggered by both UVA and UVB rays. That's where it gets really tricky because you can get UVA exposure right through a window\u2014sometimes office workers will experience it if they're working next to a window,\" Boston-based dermatologist [Robin Travers, MD](https://www.skincarephysicians.net/about-us/physicians/dr-robin-travers-dermatologist/), tells SELF. \"That also means that you can have this reaction without ever getting a sunburn, which is mainly the result of UVB rays.\" That said, \"it tends to be a reaction that people see with the first episode of real sun exposure of the year, like that first spring break trip to Florida. But as the summer goes on, the skin can 'harden' to the ultraviolet exposure, so people who are susceptible find toward the end of the summer, they don't develop this rash anymore,\" says Dr. Travers.\u00b3 Since the face is chronically exposed to the sun, a PMLE rash will rarely appear there, and usually develops on other areas that have been hidden away during the colder months, such as the chest, arms, and neck, she says. PMLE can be treated with medications such as topical steroids to ease the rash flare, says Dr. Travers, and usually fades within a couple of weeks. How can I prevent sun poisoning or PMLE? Sunscreen, sunscreen, sunscreen. \"You need to be wearing enough of it, plus reapplying every two hours,\" says Dr. Barba. Make sure to [choose a broad-spectrum sunscreen](https://www.self.com/gallery/best-sunscreen-for-face) (which protects against both UVA and UVB rays) with at least an SPF of 30, and then slather enough on your skin to create a healthy coat (which translates to the equivalent of a shot glass\u2014about two tablespoons\u2014of sunscreen for your whole body, including a nickel-size blob just for your face). \"Be sure to cover your arms, your legs, your ears, your face, your hairline, your nose, the area below the nose, your hands, the tops of your feet\u2014in other words, every part of your body that's exposed to the sun.\" Also wear as much sun-protective clothing\u2014such as a sun hat, sunglasses, and UPF swim tops and coverups\u2014as you can, adds Dr. Bodemer. \"And try to avoid the midday sun, which is when it's at its most intense heat,\" she says. That way, you and your skin can stay healthy and safe as you enjoy all the fun under the sun. Sources: [Cell Biology International, Release of Cytokines/Chemokines and Cell "}
