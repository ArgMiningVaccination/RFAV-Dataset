Key words: Nest, natural history, nestlings, Andes, cloud forest, Chusquea Tapaculo, Scytalopus parkeri. Extremely little is known about the natural history of Scytalopus tapaculos despite their broad S. parkeri ) was only recently descri bed, having formerly been considered part of the Brown-rumpedTapaculo ( S. latebricola ) complex (Krabbe & Schulenberg 1997). It ra nges from southern Ecuador to extreme northern Peru at eleva-tions of 2250 to 3350 m (Krabbe 2003). Herewe describe a nest of the Chusquea Tapaculo found at the Tapichalaca Biological Reserve(04\u00ba30'S, 79\u00ba10'W), located north of Vallado-lid in the southeastern Zamora-ChinchipeProvince of Ecuador. At 16:30 h (EST) on 7 October 2004, we found the well-hidden nest situated under anarrow crevice-like opening created by a largeroot protruding from a low bank (50 cm) nextto the trail. The nest was a mossy ball wedgedinto the back of the crevice, 25-30 cm fromthe opening. It measured 15 cm in diameteroutside, by roughly 15 cm tall and 13 cm fromfront to back. The opening was situated nearthe middle, 6 cm above the ground, and mea- sured 5 cm wide by 3 cm high. Inside cham-ber dimensions were roughly 7 cm tall by 8cm wide with a 4.5 cm deep egg cup. The nestconsisted predominantly of moss and root-lets, with a thick cup of pale fibers and a fewrootlets. The nest contained two nestlings with long grey down. We observed both adultsbringing small, single food items to the nest- lings. Prey included adult and larval Lepi-doptera, walking sticks (Phasmida), adultbeetles, and orthopterans. Adult lepidopter-ans seemed especially common, and bothadult birds were seen gleaning these fromaround an ultraviolet light located nearby.Nestling begging usually began while theadult was still a meter away from the entranceand not visible to the nestlings. It often con-tinued loudly for up to 30 s after the adults left and, especially closer to fledgling, nest-lings occasionally made muted noises in theabsence of adults. Nest lings did not produce fecal sacs in the presence of adults, but440GREENEY & ROMBOUGH instead dropped them out of the nest between feeding visits. Adults collected these and car-ried them away upon their next visit. The subterranean, mossy-ball nest was similar to previously described nests for the genus (Sclater & Salvin 1879, Johnson 1967,Skutch 1972, Stiles Brown1986, Rosenberg 1986, Sick 1993, Krabbe &Schulenberg 1997, Christian 2001, Young &Zuchowski 2003). The insect-like the Skutch, and the experience of HFG atother passerine nests, including two otherspecies of Scytalopus , suggest that such loud and incessant begging calls may be unique among Neotropical passerines. Young &Zuchowski (2003), for the ), also noted that nest- lings were vocal in the absence of adults, andremarked on the insect-like quality of the beg-ging. Based on available evidence of breeding condition adults and dependent juveniles,Krabbe (2003) suggeste d year-round breeding of the Chusquea Tapaculo, yet this remainsthe first direct evidence of breeding. It is oursincere hope that other biologists working inthe Neotropics will continue to publish allfindings on this and other poorly known spe-cies. Only with repeated, published observa-tions, on even the smallest details of naturalhistory, will we be able to piece together thedetails necessary for sound conservationpractices.
