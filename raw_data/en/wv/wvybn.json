The United States has responded to their cries for help by carrying out humanitarianrelief operations to these and other areas devastated by natural or man-made disasters. The compassionate codenames chosen by U.S. policy-makers for these operations\u2014Provide Comfort, Provide Hope, Provide Promise, Provide Relief, and Restore Hope\u2014signify the nation's determi- nation to alleviate the suffering of those less fortunate than itself. On the heels of its spectacular and decisive role in the Gulf War, the United StatesAir Force has demonstrated its immense capability to airlift tons of sup-plies and personnel in a wide variety of highly significant relief efforts. TheBeginningsofHumanitarianAirlift The Air Force's humanitarian operations received wide attention dur- ing the 1990s, as they will for years to come. They are part of a well-estab- lished tradition dating back three-quarters of a century to the early days ofmilitary flight. The nation's first airmen recognized early on aviation's potential for alleviating the effects of natural disasters. As early as September 1919, 1 Operation Provide Comfort delivered relief supplies to Kurdish refugees.Army Air Service planes from Kelly Field, Texas, dropped food supplies to marooned flood victims along the Rio Grande. On a few occasions dur- ing the 1920s, American aviators bombed their own country\u2014for good cause. They delivered ordnance against ice jams in the Delaware, Platte, and Susquehanna rivers to prevent flooding, save bridges, and restore nav-igation. 1In March 1929 at least twenty-one airplanes from Maxwell Field, Alabama, delivered twenty-seven tons of food and other supplies to flood victims in the southern part of the state.2 The Army flew several dramatic relief missions during the 1930s. In 1932 bombers dropped supplies to Navajo Indians who had become snow- bound by severe blizzards in Arizona.3In December 1935 the 5th Bombardment Group bombed the Mauna Loa volcano, diverting its lava flow away from Hilo, Hawaii.4In 1936 Air Corps squadrons flew food and other supplies to flood victims in Pennsylvania and the following year to southern Illinois.5During February 1939 the Army air-delivered med- ical aid in the wake of an earthquake in Chile.6 World War II proved the most costly conflict in history. It has been estimated that during the six years of warfare, about 85 million peoplewere killed and another 60 million rendered homeless. 7Around the globe, staggering numbers of unfortunates needed food and medical relief. TheArmyAir Forces, while contributing to theAllied victory in every theater of the war, also flew vital humanitarian missions. In September 1944 the AAF began flying food into France, a country whose national transportation system had become virtually unusable and whose gross national product by 1945 had dropped to less than half of its prewar level.8 The Netherlands had been one of the world's most prosperous countries 2 MilitaryAirlift Command's C-5s helped deliver relief supplies to Kurdish refugees in northern Iraq in Operation Provide Comfort in mid-1991.since the seventeenth century, but the war inflicted terrible hardships on this small land. Occupying German forces opened the sluice gates of dikes and caused huge floods. In \"Operation Chowhound,\" flown during the last month of the war in Europe, Army aviators brought food to Dutch civil- ians.9 Post-WorldWarIIthroughtheKoreanWar,1945-1953 Soon after the defeat of the Axis powers, fundamental differences between the United States and the Soviet Union in ideology, economics,and foreign policy\u2014which had been muted by the two allies during the war\u2014came into sharp relief. The two powers entered a period of interna- tional tension that came to be known as the Cold War. In 1947 communists fomented a civil war in Greece and President Harry Truman sent several hundred million dollars in aid to that nationand Turkey. The United States offered far greater assistance in the Marshall Plan, announced the following year. This economic effort helped Western Europe recover from its wartime devastation and build a pros- perity that blunted the appeal of communism. The United States also responded to the challenges posed by the Soviet Union during the late 1940s by extensively reorganizing the Defense Department. It was duringthis period, in September 1947, that the United States Air Force emergedas an independent service, separate from the Army. 10 In February 1948 the communists seized power in Czechoslovakia by a coup and in June of that year the Soviet Union tried to sever Berlin from the Western powers. At the end of World War II, the victorious allies had reached an agreement about the division of Germany, under which the United States, Great Britain, and France occupied three western zones,which eventually became the Federal Republic of Germany, or West Germany, and the Soviet Union occupied an eastern zone, which eventu- ally became the Peoples Democratic Republic of Germany, or East Germany. Berlin lay within the Soviet zone and was similarly divided into zones of occupation by the same four powers. The agreement assured thethree Western nations access to the city along the autobahns which ran through the Soviet zone. The Soviets reneged on this agreement and in June 1948 closed the overland routes into Berlin. Communist demonstrators drove out the elected members of the city assembly. For the next few months, the vari- ous functions of the local government were divided between east and west. These developments led to the first humanitarian airlift of the Cold War, and the largest in history. On June 28 President Truman decided, as Secretary of Defense James Forrestal recalled his words: \"We [are] going to stay[,] period.\" The United States Air Force began flying Operation Vittles, which became known as the Berlin Airlift. More than 300 3American aircraft shuttled over 1,500,000 tons of food, medicine, coal, and other supplies into the Western sector of the capital city. The Royal Air Force contributed 101 airplanes and other support to this massive effort. The Western allies sustained the Berlin Airlift for 462 days, mak- ing almost 190,000 flights. In September 1949 the Soviet Union finally conceded that its blockade had failed, and lifted it.11 The significance of the Berlin Airlift in international politics can hardly be exaggerated. Operation Vittles preserved West Berlin, a thorn in the side of East Germany, and contributed to German reunification under a democratic government in 1990. This historic effort proved that an air- lift alone could sustain a large population which was completely sur- rounded by hostile forces. Operation Vittles also demonstrated America's commitment to defend the \"free world\" from communist expansion. Finally, the Air Force sustained the Berlin Airlift at the same time that negotiations were underway to create the North Atlantic TreatyOrganization, and the successful operation provided a compelling exam-ple of the ability of the Western allies to work together. 4 A Berlin Airlift C-54 flies over a group of interested German bystanders. This C-54 commemorated the achievements of the Berlin Airlift.After this wrenching crisis over Berlin, Cold War tensions extended into the early 1950s, as the Soviet Union continued to pursue a belliger- ent foreign policy. On September 22, 1949, President Truman announced that the Soviets had tested an atomic bomb. Few American officials had expected the Soviets to develop this weapon so quickly. After learning of the test, Senator Arthur Vandenberg declared: \"This is now a differentworld.\" 12 Ominous developments took place in China as well. The civil war there ended in 1949 in a communist victory, and the new government soon joined the Soviets in stirring up trouble for the United States around the globe. The Cold War turned hot in June 1950 when North Korea, supplied with arms and encouraged by the Soviets, invaded South Korea. President Truman sent United States forces to defend the South, and the United Nations also called on its members to help repel the communist attack.The UN command drove back the North Koreans, but the Chinese cameto their aid and the fighting seesawed down and up the Korean peninsula. After three years of bloody conflict and two years of frustrating negotia- tions, the communists agreed to a truce and recognized an armistice line similar to the prewar one. The intervention of the United States and theUN had saved South Korea from its neighbor's aggression. 13 The armistice that ended hostilities included provisions for exchang- ing prisoners of war. In the course of \"Little Switch,\" between April 20 and May 3, 1953, the UN released 6,670 prisoners of war in return for 684 held by the North Koreans. During \"Big Switch,\" which began late that July, the allies exchanged 75,823 POWs for 12,773. A host of four- engined and C-97s, as well as two-engined C-46s andC-47s, brought these POWs home. 14 5 Repatriated South Korean soldiers arrive at Freedom Village inAugust 1953.During the Korean War, the U.S. carried out a dramatic humanitarian airlift in the Middle East that was necessitated by a breakdown of trans- portation arrangements, rather than by war or natural catastrophe. In 1952 about 3,700 Islamic pilgrims en route to Mecca became stranded in Beirut, Lebanon. Thirteen Air Force C-54s flew them to the holy city in time for their religious observances and wonAmerica considerable goodwill among Arabs.15 Natural disasters the following year led to some of the largest airlifts ever flown on the Pacific Rim. In June and July 1953 floods struck Kyushu and southern Honshu, Japan, leaving more than 600 people dead, over 1,100 injured, and in excess of a million homeless. At least twenty- eight American C-119s, C-46s, and C-47s from Ashiya and Itami air bases airlifted more than 157 tons of relief cargo\u2014including helicopters,water purification equipment, electric generators, bedding, food, clothing,and medicine\u2014to the stricken islands. This airlift relieved the suffering of the flood victims, and also demonstrated the commitment of the United States to the welfare of Japan, which for four years had provided bases forAmerica's Korean War operations. 16 The humanitarian missions flown during this period did not all take place overseas. The Air Force mounted Operation Hayride, the second 6 Islamic pilgrims traveling to Mecca on an Air Force C-54 in 1952.largest domestic airlift, in early 1949, after blizzards hit eight western states. Cargo aircraft made more than 200 flights and transported more than 4,700 tons of supplies and equipment to areas hit by the storms.17 FromtheKoreanWartotheVietnamWar,1953-1965 Between the Korean and Vietnam wars, the United States Air Force flew a large number of humanitarian airlift missions. The majority were prompted by natural disasters\u2014largely floods and earthquakes\u2014but a few were precipitated by political crises.As during the early years of the Cold War, the Air Force mounted most of these operations overseas, although in some cases its help was called for at home. Natural disasters and human conflicts generated several missions in 1954. That year a flood devastated India and East Pakistan, and at least twenty-seven American cargo planes transported more than 150 tons of medical supplies, bedding, food, clothing, and other items to the stricken region.18After the communist victory at Dien Bien Phu in the spring of 1953, the French began withdrawing their forces from Southeast Asia. During the following year twenty C-124s, C-97s, and C-118s helped air- lift more than 500 wounded French soldiers from Indochina to France or to North Africa.19 Diplomatic events motivated other airlift operations during the mid- 1950s. In May 1955 the Air Force conducted one of its most unusual humanitarian missions when it flew twenty-five Japanese women, victimsof the bombing of Hiroshima, to New York for plastic surgery. This good- will gesture contributed to the strong friendship which developed between the United States and Japan after World War II. 20 7 Operation Hayride supplied western states snowed under in early 1949.Two major Cold War events put Air Force cargo planes into the air in 1956. In late July Egyptian President Gamal Abdel Nasser nationalized the British-controlled Universal Suez Canal Company, precipitating an international crisis that lasted through the end of the year. Twenty-four air-craft evacuated hundreds of Americans from the Middle East during thisexigency. 21In October, Hungarians rebelled against the communist regime the Soviet Union had installed in their country. Soviet tankscrushed the rebellion, driving thousands of refugees into West Germany, Austria, and Switzerland. In November and December, Air Force cargo planes brought 189 tons of food and supplies to the camps housing these fugitives. 22By the end of June 1957, airlifts Safe Haven I and II had trans- ported more than 10,000 refugees from Europe to new homes in the United States.23 Natural disasters prompted several USAF humanitarian missions dur- ing the early 1960s. A particularly prominent example came in response to a series of earthquakes that struck Chile on May 21 and 22, 1960. The tremors, some registering more than seven on the Richter scale, produced avalanches, landslides, tidal waves, and even volcanic eruptions. Eight thousand people were left dead or missing, 5,500 were injured, and more 8 Hungarian refugees arrive in the U.S. during Operation Safe Haven.than 240,000 were left homeless. Chile requested American assistance, and the State Department solicited a military airlift.24Between May 23 and June 23 Air Force transporters brought more than 1,000 tons of dis- aster relief equipment and supplies to the beleaguered country, in an oper- ation called the \"AmigosAirlift.\" The cargo included twoArmy field hos-pitals, tenArmy helicopters, tents, cots, blankets, clothing, and food. FourAir Force wings based in the United States participated in the airlift, as did the service's Caribbean Command in the Panama Canal Zone. They flew a variety of transport aircraft, including two-engine C-47s and four- engine C-118s, C-124s, and C-54s, and H-19 helicopters as well. In addition to the relief cargo, the airplanes carried more than 2,400 passen- gers, including refugees, medical personnel, and communications special- ists. Most of the flights followed a 4,500-mile, 25-hour route from vari-ous terminals in the United States to Santiago, Chile, with refueling stops in Panama and Peru. 25 In the autumn of 1960 a cyclone struck East Pakistan and seven C-130s and C-124s delivered eighty-nine tons of relief cargo.26In October 1961 two C-130s and seven C-124s transported more than 260 tons of construction equipment, sand bags, and water purification equip-ment to help flood victims in Cambodia. 27Forty-seven planes delivered 9 TheAmigosAirlift in mid-1960 supplied food to Chilean earthquake victims.more than 900 tons of relief cargo to Iran after an earthquake in 1962.28 Shortly after Typhoon Karen struck Guam the same year, that island's Andersen Air Force Base became the target of another major humanitar- ian airlift. Fifty transports delivered 970 tons of relief supplies and evac- uated 760 people.29The presence of an American air force base on Guam facilitated a quick response to the devastation. Floods prompted two significant airlifts in 1964. In the first, seven C-130s ferried 946 tons of supplies to Pakistan after a late-summer IndusRiver disaster brought widespread damage to the provinces of Punjab andSind. 30Later in the year, a fleet of helicopters, C-123s, and C-124s, as well as C-130s responded to a flood in South Vietnam. These airliftersdelivered more than 2,000 tons of food, clothing, medicine, boats, and fuel, and carried over 1,500 evacuees to higher ground. 31 During this period the Air Force flew important domestic, as well as foreign, missions. In March and April 1964 Operation Helping Handaided victims of an earthquake in Anchorage, Alaska. At least 105 cargo planes and helicopters delivered 1,850 tons of generators, water purifica- tion facilities, construction equipment, food, medicine, bedding, clothing,and other cargo to the disaster zone. They also airlifted 850 personnel, including emergency rescue workers and evacuees. 32Operation Biglift of December 1964 and January 1965 offered a final notable example during this period.After flooding in California and Oregon, transporters mounted 245 flights and delivered 1,598 tons of relief equipment and supplies.33 TheVietnamWarEra,1965-1973 During the early 1960s the United States gradually became engaged in an undeclared war in Southeast Asia. After President John Kennedy's assassination in November 1963, Vice President Lyndon Johnson suc-ceeded him and further expanded America's military commitment to South Vietnam. As the war against the Viet Cong and North Vietnamese dragged on through the remainder of the 1960s, casualties mounted and the public became increasingly frustrated by the conflict. Domestic dis-sent climbed to unprecedented heights. In 1969 Richard Nixon succeeded Johnson as president and tried to address the country's frustration by\"Vietnamizing\" the war, shifting the burden of the combat to the South Vietnamese while withdrawing American forces. The last American units left Southeast Asia in 1973 and the tragedy culminated when the North Vietnamese overran South Vietnam during the spring of 1975. 34 During this period theAir Force undertook not only extensive combat air operations in Southeast Asia, but also many humanitarian airlift mis-sions. It was not surprising that the first of these involved South Vietnam. As the conflict there intensified in 1965, the number of refugees increased, and during October and November seventeen C-130s airlifted 157 tons of clothing to displaced South Vietnamese peasants. 35 10The Air Force directed several of its Vietnam-era airlift operations to Pakistan. In November and December 1970, at least seventeen C-141s and C-130s delivered over 140 tons of equipment and supplies to East Pakistan to relieve cyclone victims.36The following summer the airlifters were active again in the same region. Hundreds of thousands of refugeesfled to India from a civil war in East Pakistan, and thirteen C-130s and C-141s brought over 2,000 tons of food, medicine, and other supplies to them. These aircraft also evacuated more than 23,000 refugees from over- crowded camps. 37In 1973 Pakistan became the focus of the largest airlift, in tonnage, ever staged in west Asia. Two C-5s and twelve C-141s trans- ported a record 2,400 tons of relief supplies and equipment to help floodvictims. 38 Hundreds of miles to the east, the Vietnam War came to a tragic end during the spring of 1975. When the Saigon regime collapsed, airliftersrescued tens of thousands of refugees. The mass evacuation of South Vietnam was accomplished by a complex of four overlapping operations: 11 Schoolchildren of South Vietnam receive school supplies donated by citi- zens of Huber Heights, Ohio.Babylift, New Life, Frequent Wind, and New Arrivals. Most of the Vietnamese evacuees eventually settled in the United States.At least forty aircraft participated in the emergency missions at the end of the war. Air Force planes also delivered more than 8,000 tons of supplies to temporaryrefugee camps in the Philippines and on Guam and Wake islands. 39 FromtheVietnamWarthroughtheGulfWar,1973-1991 Since the Vietnam War, humanitarian airlift operations have required more special equipment and increasingly skilled operators. Using modi- fied cargo planes in a series of domestic shuttle flights, the Air Forcesprayed more than 2,000 tons of fire suppressant chemicals over each of three western forest fires during the summers of 1977, 1979, and 1987. 40 The service's fire-fighting aircraft also sprayed more than 1,000 tons of chemicals over forest fires in California in August 1975 and in NorthCarolina in May 1986. 41 Throughout this period, Africa remained a continent in much need of assistance. Drought and famine drew American airlifters to the Sahelregion, just south of the Sahara, during the 1970s and 1980s. U.S. Air Force planes delivered large quantities of food to millions of hungry 12 Refugees from South Vietnam being evacuated from Saigon to Guam aboard anAir Force C-141.Africans, whose plight was publicized worldwide by rock musicians who performed at fund-raising concerts. Two of the largest Air Force humanitarian airlift operations to Africa were Authentic Assistance in 1973 and King Grain in 1974. In each instance, transporters delivered more than 9,000 tons of food to Mali, Chad, and Mauritania after a severe drought and famine. Fleets of four- engine C-130s distributed rice, wheat, flour, and powdered milk to vil- lages in the Sahel region. The African climate prevented the planes from storing liquid oxygen for high-altitude flights, and a combination of heat,dust, poor fuel, and rocky runways multiplied aircraft maintenance prob-lems. Yet the cargo carriers were able to deliver more than 18,000 tons of food to famine victims in less than two years. 42In an October 1989 oper- ation called Africa-2, an Air Force C-5 brought 250 tons of food, cloth- ing, washing machines, and refrigerators to Chad and neighboring coun- tries.43 Asia rivaled Africa in receiving the attention of USAF airlifters after the Vietnam War. An earthquake in Turkey triggered an operation of 606 tons, carried by forty cargo planes.44During the Iranian revolution of 1978-1979, more than 100 C-5 and C-141 flights evacuated 5,800 Americans from that nation.45A much longer airlift, lasting from 1986 to beyond 1991, aided Afghan refugees who had fled to Pakistan after theSoviet Union invaded their country. During its first two years, this opera-tion delivered more than 400 tons of relief supplies and transported over400 injured war victims to other nations for medical treatment. By the end of 1991, the Military Airlift Command had flown over 100 missions for the Afghan refugees in Pakistan. 46A severe earthquake struck Armenia at 13 Rollers are dragged to anAir Force C-5 in OperationAfrica-2.the end of 1988, and between that December and a year later, five C-5s, fourteen C-141s, and one C-9 airlifted 547 tons of tents, blankets, medi- cine, food, clothing, and trucks to the victims of the disaster.47 Much closer to home, Hurricane Hugo tore through the Caribbean in September 1989 before hitting South Carolina. In the wake of this storm, a fleet of C-5s, C-141s, C-130s, and a KC-10 made 128 flights and delivered more than 3,900 tons of relief supplies to Puerto Rico and the Virgin Islands.48 TheEarlyNineties,1991-1994 On August 2, 1990, Iraq invaded Kuwait, its small neighbor to the south. Iraqi dictator Saddam Hussein occupied this oil-rich nation with infantry and armored units and declared it his country's nineteenth province. With Saddam's forces threatening Saudi Arabia, the USAF moved quickly. Along with the other military services, it conducted Operation Desert Shield, an enormous deployment to defend the Saudi kingdom, and President George Bush mobilized an international coalition against Saddam Hussein. The United Nations set January 15, 1991, as thedeadline for the Iraqi dictator to end the illegal occupation of Kuwait. After Saddam defied this warning, almost forty nations participated inDesert Storm, the military operation which liberated Kuwait. U.S. AirForce and other coalition pilots flew a remarkably successful forty-three 14 An injuredAfghan refugee receives assistance upon his arrival from Pakistan.day air campaign, the centerpiece of the coalition's victory over Iraq in the Gulf War.49 In the wake of the Gulf War, Saddam Hussein brutally crushed a rebellion of the Kurds within his own country. During Provide Comfort, flown betweenApril and July 1991, the USAF airlifted nearly 40,000 tons of relief supplies to Kurdish refugees in northern Iraq. The operation's 1,100 missions also moved more than 14,000 of these displaced people.50 During the Gulf War the Soviet Union offered no obstacles to American actions, because the once-dangerous superpower was now beset with severe problems of its own. In November 1989 the East German gov- ernment had dismantled the Berlin Wall and accepted free travel across the city and elsewhere within East Germany. Throughout Eastern Europe, democratic governments began to replace communist dictatorships which had held power for more than a generation. Within the Soviet Union itself, an August 1991 coup by communist hardliners briefly threatened President Mikhail Gorbachev. After his reinstatement, further democratic reforms led by Boris Yeltsin spawned the dissolution of the Soviet Union and replaced it with the Commonwealth of Independent States. The Cold War ended and a new era opened in international relations.51 These momentous events during the early 1990s created a need for massive humanitarian operations. When the Soviet Union collapsed in 1991, economic distress threatened its citizens with malnutrition and dis- ease, and in February 1992 the United States mounted a humanitarian air- lift to help the people of this enormous nation. The first phase of this oper- ation, called Provide Hope, delivered 2,274 tons of food and medical sup- 15 In northern Iraq, a C-130 flies over a hastily-prepared airstrip during a Provide Comfort airlift mission.plies to the former Soviet republics, with nineteen C-5 and forty-six C-141 missions flown within seventeen days.Asecond phase, of 182 mis- sions, followed from late February 1992 to September 1993.52 An even greater tragedy befell Yugoslavia, where the collapse of the decades-old communist regime resulted in the disintegration of the coun-try. Conflict within Bosnia-Herzegovina among Serbs, Croats, andMuslims disrupted the economy and threatened the people of Sarajevo with starvation. In response, the United States airlifted food and medicine into the Bosnian capital in an operation called Provide Promise, which began in July 1992 and exceeded the duration of the Berlin Airlift. 53By February 17, 1993, 450 C-130 flights had brought almost 10,000 tons of relief to Bosnia.54 16 Soldiers from the former Soviet republics unload medicine and supplies from an Air National Guard C-141. On the ground in Zagreb, Croatia, during Operation Provide Promise.The USAF delivered large amounts of aid elsewhere around the globe. Operation Provide Relief, which took place betweenAugust and December 1992, transported thousands of tons of food to Somalia and Kenya in 1,400 C-141 and C-130 missions. This effort helped the victims of a famine caused by drought and civil war.55After a storm in Bangladesh in the spring of 1991, Air Force C-5s and C-141s airlifted 832 tons of relief supplies to flood victims in Operation Sea Angel.56After the eruption of Mount Pinatubo in the Philippines in June 1991, the USAF undertook Operation Fiery Vigil, the largest air evacuation since the end of the Vietnam War. A combination of Military Airlift Command transports and civilian airlinersferried more than 50,000 uniformed personnel and civilians from ClarkAir Base and Subic Bay Naval Station to the United States. 57 The early 1990s also offered two major examples of domestic human- itarian operations. After Hurricane Andrew hit southern Florida in late August 1992, Air Force C-5s, C-130s, and HH-60 helicopters helpedbring aid to the Miami area. By September 4 they had flown more than 500 missions to the region, delivered 11,000 tons of cargo, and transported over 7,000 passengers, including military relief workers. 58When the Mississippi River and its tributaries flooded much of the Midwest during the summer of 1993, the Federal Emergency ManagementAgency and the U.S. Forces Command requested airlift assistance from the Air Mobility Command.AMC employed C-5s and C-141s in more than thirty missions to deliver more than a million empty sandbags and fourteen water purifi- cation systems to Iowa, Illinois, and Missouri. The airlift helped workers contain some of the flooding and prevent the spread of disease.59 TheEndoftheTwentiethCentury,1994-2000 Between 1994 and the end of the twentieth century in 2000, the Department of Defense and the United States Air Force continued the tra- dition of providing humanitarian aid all over the world. Despite the end of more than forty years of Cold War between the United States and the Soviet Union, political crises persisted in southwestern Asia, in south- eastern Europe, and in eastern Africa. The United States enforced no-fly zones over northern and southern Iraq to discourage Saddam Hussein from threatening the Kurds in the north and Kuwait in the south. The peaceful dissolution of the Soviet Union into fifteen republics and Czechoslovakia into two was not repeated in the former Yugoslavia,where a civil war broke out in Bosnia-Herzegovina, and where genocidethreatened ethnicAlbanians in Serbia's Kosovo province. Somalia in east-ern Africa also suffered from a civil war that elicited, like the formerYugoslavia, American military intervention. Against this background of conflict, humanitarian airlifts provided aid to the victims of both political and natural disasters. Many of the humanitarian airlifts of the 1990s aided refugees from 17political upheavals in Africa. In 1994, civil war between the Hutus and Tutsis of Rwanda forced thousands of refugees into neighboring coun- tries. In an Operation called Support Hope, USAF C-5 and C-141 trans-ports airlifted equipment and supplies from Germany to Zaire, Uganda, and Kenya. By 12 September, the Air Mobility Command had flown 700 missions to airlift more than 11,000 passengers and 23,000 tons of reliefcargo.Almost 400 KC-135 missions refueled the C-5s and C-141s in theair during their Support Hope flights. Several dozen KC-10 missions also delivered fuel from Zimbabwe to Entebbe, Uganda, the hub of the opera- tion. USAF C-130s carried some of the cargo from Kenya and Uganda to refugee camps in Zaire. By November 15, C-130s from nine units of theAir National Guard, on rotation to Europe, had flown 915 sorties and air- lifted more than 4,000 passengers and 4,500 tons of cargo for the Rwandan refugees. 60 In April 1996, civil unrest in Liberia resulted in the evacuation by air of more than 2,000 noncombatants in an operation called Assured Response. USAF aircraft taking part, in the course of 94 missions,included MH-53 Pave Low helicopters, MC-130 Combat Talon aircraft,AC-130 gunships, KC-135 Stratotankers, and C-130 cargo aircraft. Air Mobility Command aircraft took many of the evacuees from Freetown, Sierra Leone, to Dakar, Senegal, where they were assisted in traveling toother destinations. By May 6, the command had flown 103 missions, moving 2,153 passengers and 2,148 tons of cargo. 61 The next year, Zaire experienced similar civil unrest. Operation Guardian Retrieval, which lasted from March to June, involved aircrews of a large variety of USAF airplanes, including MH-53s, MC-130s, C-5s, C-17s, C-141s, and KC-135s. In the first month alone, they evacuatedmore than 500 U.S. citizens and other third-country nationals from Zaire on 57 missions. 62 In 1998, USAF KC-135 tanker-transports and MC-130s from the 352d Special Operations Group evacuated noncombatants from Guinea- Bissau in an operation called Shepherd Venture. Noncombatant evacua- tions from African nations experiencing civil war was very common dur- ing the last decade of the twentieth century.63 But Africa was not the only area where political crises required the movement of people or relief equipment between 1994 and 2000. Attacks by Saddam Hussein's army against Kurds in the northern part of Iraq forced thousands to flee. In operations called Pacific Haven and Quick Transit in 1996, USAF aircraft helped transport thousands of Kurdishrefugees toAndersenAir Force Base in Guam, where they were processed for resettlement within the United States. 64 Europe was not immune from similar crises. In 1996, Operation Provide Promise concluded as the longest sustained humanitarian airlift operation in history. In less than four years, USAF aircraft flew more than 4,500 sorties to deliver some 62,800 tons of cargo to Sarajevo and other 18parts of Bosnia-Herzegovina, which had endured a terrible civil war between Serbs, Bosnians, and Croatians.65 In April 1999, USAF C-5, C-17, and C-130 transports delivered food, medicine, tents, bedding, and other relief cargo to ethnic Albanians who had fled Serbia's Kosovo province to refugee camps in Albania,Macedonia, and Montenegro. By July, the operation, called Shining Hope, had airlifted almost 6,000 tons of relief supplies and 913 passengers. 66 Humanitarian airlifts between 1994 and 2000 did not respond only to the victims of political crises. Natural disasters such as floods continued to victimize thousands of people around the world. In July 1995, three C-130s from the 37th Airlift Squadron at Ramstein Air Base in Germany airlifted relief supplies to flood victims around Kharkov in Ukraine.67 In the United States itself, during 1997, flooding of the Red River of the North resulted in an airlift of 50 generators, 900 sleeping bags, 4,000 blankets, and 90 pallets of Red Cross supplies from the states of Washington and California to Grand Forks Air Force Base in NorthDakota, from which they were carried to flood victims. For the domestic flood relief operation, Air Mobility Command flew 13 missions and air- lifted 146 tons of cargo and 143 passengers. 68 In May 1998, Ecuador also experienced disastrous flooding as a result of torrential rains. In response, the 24th Operations Group, then based atHoward Air Force Base in the Canal Zone of Panama, airlifted medicine,mattresses, wheelbarrows, plastic sheeting, and food from Quayaquil and Quito to the Menabi area. The group flew seven C-27 cargo aircraft thatwere small enough to land on the tiny airfields available in the region. 69 Another flood in Vietnam during November of the next year resulted in an airlift of nearly 22,000 pounds of plastic sheeting, 3,600 blankets,and 5,000 water containers from Guam to Hue. Two C-130s from the 353d Special Operations Group, based in Japan, performed the missions. 70 In December of 1999, another serious flood struck Venezuela, result- ing in relief missions that lasted until March 2000.Among the aircraft tak- ing part were transports such as C-130s, C-5s, C-17s, and MH-60 heli- copters. The 2000 part of the operation, named Fundamental Response,included eleven C-17 and five C-5 missions, which airlifted 189 passen- gers and 527 tons of cargo to Caracas. 71 Other flooding in southeastern Africa during March of 2000 resulted in a massive humanitarian airlift during OperationAtlas Response. USAFC-5s and C-17s carried relief cargo 4,600 miles from Germany to South Africa. Other USAF aircraft, including C-130s and MH-53 and HH-60 helicopters, took the equipment and supplies, including food, water, med- icine, and tents, on to the flood victims in Mozambique and Madagascar.By the end of the operation in April, Air Mobility Command C-5s and C-17s had airlifted 720 passengers and 910 tons of cargo. 72 Hurricanes and typhoons also victimized thousands of people between 1994 and 2000. In 1995, after Hurricane Marilyn devastated 19islands in the eastern Caribbean Sea, USAF cargo aircraft and commercial aircraft under contract airlifted 2,348 passengers and 3,617 tons of cargo on 212 missions to Puerto Rico and the Virgin Islands in an operation called Caribbean Express. This was the first disaster-relief operation in which C-17s took part. Other USAF transports included C-5s, C-141s, and C-130s.73 Typhoon Paka hit Guam on December 15, 1997 with record-breaking 236 mile-per-hour winds, leaving 1,700 people homeless. By January 4, 1998, Air Force airplanes had delivered more than 2.7 million pounds of relief supplies on 45 relief flights, many of them across the Pacific Ocean. The cargo included generators, tents, medical supplies, telephone poles,bottled water, and cots. The 60th, 62d, KC-10s. A civilian- contracted Boeing 747 transported additional relief supplies. 74 In 1998, two powerful hurricanes struck the Caribbean. In September and October, at least 190 Air Mobility Command, Air Force Reserve, and Air National Guard flights from all over the United States airlifted med- ical teams, water, ice, generators, plastic sheeting, refrigeration units, con-struction equipment, and relief supplies to the victims of Hurricane Georges in the Virgin Islands, Puerto Rico, the Dominican Republic, and southern Mississippi. The airlift moved 450 passengers and 8,500 tons of cargo. In November, Hurricane Mitch struck Honduras, Nicaragua, Belize, Guatemala, El Salvador, and southern Mexico. In an operation called Strong Suppor, USAF aircraft from at least ten states flew some 7.4million pounds of relief cargo to Central America. Most of the C-130 air- crews came from the Air Force Reserve or the Air National Guard. Theydelivered such items as rice, flour, medical supplies, clothing, and build- ing materials. 75 Winter storms also called for USAF humanitarian airlifts. At the end of 1997 and the beginning of 1998, they struck New Mexico and the Northeast. In response to a blizzard in New Mexico in December, Air National Guard C-130s from Oklahoma, Texas, Wyoming, Minnesota, and Iowa airlifted nearly 465 tons of hay to snowbound livestock in an operation called Haydrop. In another operation called Recuperation,C-17s from the 437th Airlift Wing flew four missions to transport emer- gency workers, 181 tons of vehicles, generators, water purification equip- ment, field kitchens, and relief supplies from Edmonton, Alberta, to Montreal Quebec. During the same month, January 1998, thirteen C-5s and five C-17s transported utility workers, trucks, chain saws, and other emergency cargo from North Carolina to Maine and New York because ofan ice storm. The 106th Rescue Wing of the Air National Guard also flew an MH-60 for the relief operation. 76 Not only storms but also earthquakes all over the world elicited USAF humanitarian airlift operations in the period 1994-2000. In January 1994, after an earthquake in southern California, six C-5 and four C-141 mis- 20sions airlifted 270 disaster specialists and 340,000 pounds of relief cargo, including fire trucks, generators, and communications vans, to Los Angeles.77 A year later, after another major earthquake struck Kobe, Japan, C-130s of the 374thAirlift Wing, based in Japan, delivered relief supplies to the victims.78 A437thAirlift Wing C-17 airlifted 40 tons of blankets, sleeping bags, medical supplies, rations, and cold weather clothing from Kadena Air Base in Japan to Beijing after an earthquake in China's Hebei Province inJanuary 1998. 79 In an August 1999 operation called Avid Response, a 436th Airlift Wing C-5 airlifted a 70-person search and rescue team, along with dogsand 56,000 pounds of equipment, including three vehicles, from the United States to Turkey after a severe earthquake there. Two KC-10s from the 305th Air Mobility Wing refueled the C-5 on its non-stop flight.By September 10, the Air Mobility Command had flown 20 missions in support of the operation. 80 Forest fires, not only within the United States but also abroad, also continued to elicit Air Force humanitarian airlift missions. In August 1996, six fires devastated northern California. Flying from the airport atRedding, four C-130s, two each from the 302d and 146th Airlift Wings, flew low over the fringes of the fires, each dropping as many as 3,000 gal- lons of water and fire retardant at a time using the Modular Airborne FireFighting System. 81 In response to forest fires in Indonesia in the autumn of 1997, three WyomingAir National Guard C-130s from the 153dAirlift Wing dropped685,000 gallons of water and fire retardant around fires in Java and Sumatra. Between October 12 and early December, they had flown more than 200 sorties. 82 In July 1998, ten C-5 and two C-141 missions airlifted 300 firefight- ers and 740 tons of equipment from California, Oregon, and South Carolina to Jacksonville Naval Air Station and Patrick Air Force Base to fight forest fires in Florida. The operation was called Phoenix Flame.83 Another series of fires in the West resulted in a USAF airlift of almost 6,000Army and Marine Corps troops to augment civilian firefighters dur-ing the summer of 2000. C-130s from the 145th, 146th 153d, and 302dAirlift Wings flew 774 sorties between July 25 and September 6, dropping 970,500 gallons of fire retardant on wild fires in California, Idaho, and Montana. 84 Throughout the period, Denton Amendment airlift missions also con- tinued. They delivered privately donated relief supplies to foreign nations at no charge to the charitable organizations that contributed them. Many of these missions were included in Operation Provide Hope, which aided the people of the fifteen republics of the former Soviet Union in the wake ofits dissolution. In June 1997, the 500th Provide Hope mission was flown 21when a C-5 from the 436th Airlift Wing transported relief supplies from Maryland to Tashkent, Uzbekistan. By then, the operation had delivered more than $1.8 billion in assistance since its beginning in February 1992.85 IntotheTwenty-FirstCentury,2001-2007 Between 2001 and 2007, President George W. Bush led a \"Global War on Terrorism\" in response to September 11, 2001 terrorist attacks on the United States that destroyed the twin 110-story towers of New York's World Trade Center and part of the Pentagon in Washington. The United States invaded Afghanistan in 2001 and toppled its Taliban regime because it had harbored Al Qaeda terrorists. In March 2003, President Bush also launched an invasion of Iraq which overthrew the dictatorshipof Saddam Hussein. Although both invasions succeeded, insurgencies kept American forces busy in both Iraq and Afghanistan. USAF airliftresources were largely committed to the need to transport troops and war materiel to and from southwestern Asia. Despite ongoing war commit- ments, the Air Force continued to participate in humanitarian airlifts to relieve the victims of natural and political disasters around the world. One of the USAF humanitarian airlift operations in the period 2001- 2007 was a component of the larger Operation Enduring Freedom in Afghanistan. In early October 2001, C-17s began flying 22-hour 6,500-mile round trip missions from Ramstein Air Base in Germany to drop thousands of rations to the people of Afghanistan in areas not underTaliban control. The tremendously long flights required extensive aerial refueling. By the end of the month, the airlift had delivered its millionthmeal. By the end of the year, C-17s had airdropped 2.44 million dailyrations, 21,000 55-pound sacks of wheat, and more than 41,000 blanketson 198 missions. The operation continued into 2002. 86 Fighting in Lebanon in July 2006 elicited another USAF humanitar- ian airlift. MH-53 helicopters from the 386th Special Operations Group airlifted noncombatant Americans from Lebanon to Cyprus, to which thousands of other noncombatants also fled by other means. C-130s of the386th Air Expeditionary Wing flew more than 10 tons of food, blankets, bottled water, and other supplies to Cyprus for the evacuees. C-17s of the816th Expeditionary Airlift Squadron also transported 500 tons of food, water, and equipment to Cyprus. Other evacuees from Lebanon reached Incirlik Air Base in Turkey by ship and overland transportation. From Cyprus and Turkey, USAF C-17s airlifted 2,250 passengers to Ramstein Air Base in Germany and then on to the McGuire Air Force Base in New Jersey. Airliners under Air Mobility Command contract moved thousandsmore U.S. citizens to the United States from Cyprus and Turkey, to whichthey had gone from Lebanon. Between July 16 and September 3, some 12,700 evacuees had been airlifted in the largest noncombatant evacuation operation since Vietnam. 87 22USAF humanitarian airlift operations in the period 2001-2007 contin- ued to respond to the needs of the victims of natural disasters such as earthquakes. For example, an intense earthquake in western India in January 2001 killed as many as 30,000 people and left hundreds of thou- sands homeless. Two C-5s, refueled by KC-135s from the Hawaiian Air National Guard, carried 115 tons of relief cargo across the Pacific Ocean from California to Guam. From there, four C-17s, refueled by KC-135sstationed in Japan, carried the supplies on to the airport at Ahmedabad, India, whose runways were too small to accommodate the C-5s. 88 Another major earthquake in Algeria in May 2003 resulted in the air- lift of 13 tons of medicine, blankets, bedding, tents, and portable kitchens from Ramstein Air Base in Germany to Algiers. The Air Force Reserve's 910th Airlift Wing performed the operation, using C-130s.89 An earthquake in December at Bam, Iran, earned the distinction of the world's worst natural disaster of 2003. Despite long-standing enmity between the United States and Iran, USAF airplanes airlifted 338,000 pounds of water, medical supplies, blankets, and food to the disaster vic- tims. One C-5 based at Dover Air Force Base, staging at Moron Air Base in Spain, transported some of the relief supplies to Kuwait, where they were loaded on C-130s that flew on to Kerman Air Base in Iran. One C-17 already in the theater also flew relief supplies from Kuwait to Kerman.Another C-17 from CharlestonAir Force Base, staging at Rhein- MainAir Base in Germany, flew directly to Kerman with more relief sup- plies. From Kerman, Iranian military trucks took the cargo on to Bam.90 An even worse earthquake disaster struck the Indian Ocean on December 26, 2004. An undersea quake measuring 9 on the Richter scaleproduced a tsunami as high as 30 feet that reached many countries bor- dering the ocean, including Indonesia, Sri Lanka, India, and Thailand. Asmany as 300,000 people died from the sudden flood. Humanitarian assis- tance to the victims of the tsunami came from many countries all over the world, including the United States. In an operation called Unified Assis- tance, Air Mobility Command aircraft flew 106 missions to airlift 2,768 passengers and 3,370 tons of cargo to Colombo in Sri Lanka, U-TapaoAir Base in Thailand, and Banda Aceh and Jakarta in Indonesia by February 23, 2005. The 353d Special Operations Group flew MC-130s to deliver almost 800,000 pounds of relief cargo, evacuate 32 casualties, and airlift 591 relief workers to isolated parts of Thailand and Indonesia. The NewYork Air National Guard's 105th Airlift Wing flew C-5s to transport res- cue helicopters, water purification equipment, and relief supplies fromKadena Air Base, Japan, to Sri Lanka and Thailand. 91 Another earthquake in Pakistan in October 2005 left nearly 80,000 people dead. In response, USAF C-17s, C-130s, KC-10s, and contract airliners delivered nearly 10 million pounds of relief supplies, including food, water, tents, sleeping bags, cots, blankets, heaters, clothing, medi-cine, and medical equipment, to Chaklala Air Base. USAF C-5s of the 23439thAirlift Wing also carried U.S. Army helicopters to Pakistan. From Chaklala, they flew relief supplies to victims in the disaster region. This humanitarian airlift, named Operation Lifeline, was facilitated by the con-tinuing U.S. military operations in neighboring Afghanistan. 92 Besides earthquakes, hurricanes and typhoons also victimized thou- sands of people who needed humanitarian assistance. After TyphoonPongsana struck Guam in December 2002 with sustained winds of 150miles per hour, the Air Force airlifted 1,200 tons of relief equipment and supplies to Andersen Air Force Base, flying 58 C-5 missions in 10 days. The 60th and 349th Air Mobility Wings took part. 93 The greatest of the humanitarian airlifts in the early 21st century undoubtedly was in response to Hurricane Katrina, which struck the cen- tral coast of the Gulf of Mexico in southeastern Louisiana, southern Mississippi, and southwestern Alabama at the end of August 2005. The hurricane's winds destroyed most of the buildings on the Mississippi Gulf Coast and left most of New Orleans under floodwaters for weeks. Although most of the city's residents had evacuated, thousands whoremained were stranded in the midst of the waters without adequate shel-ter, food, water, electricity, and plumbing. USAF HH-60, UH-1, and MH-53 helicopter crews conducted weeks of search and rescue missions, the larger helicopters refueling from HC-130 and MC-130 tankers. Larger USAF C-5, C-17, and C-130 transports from the Air Mobility Command, Air Force Reserve Command, and the Air National Guard evacuated hundreds of refugees from the disaster area to other states, and also airlifted relief supplies from all over the country to the places wherethe displaced persons had been moved. The transports carried emergency personnel to the disaster region, including doctors and nurses to treat the sick and injured and engineers to reverse the flooding. U.S. Army troops from the 82dAirborne Division andAir National Guard troops from otherstates also rode USAF airplanes to New Orleans to keep order and enforce the law. USAF helicopters flew 648 sorties, 599 of these on missions that rescued 4322 people. Air Force fixed-wing aircraft flew 4,095 sorties, 3,398 of these on air mobility missions. USAF aircraft evacuated 26,943 displaced persons from New Orleans and surrounding areas to airports and bases outside the disaster area. TheAir Force air-evacuated more than 2,600 medical patients to medical facilities across the country. The servicealso airlifted 11,450 tons of relief cargo from various parts of the country to the disaster zone. The USAF contribution to Hurricane Katrina relief,despite its impressive totals, was a small fraction of the total Department of Defense effort. 94 Even as hurricane relief missions in the New Orleans and southern Mississippi areas continued, another hurricane named Rita struck the bor-der of Louisiana and Texas on September 23. Joint Task Force-Rita orga- nized three air expeditionary groups for the emergency. A combination of C-5s, C-17s, C-130s, C-9s, and civilian aircraft evacuated more than 245,000 patients from medical facilities in Beaumont and Houston, Texas, and Lake Charles, Louisiana. Between September 23 and 29, thirteen USAF HH-60 helicopters, refueled by three HC-130s, and six UH-1 heli- copters in the 347thAir Expeditionary Group, flew 210 search and rescue sorties over eastern Texas and southwestern Louisiana. Two C-130s of the 910th Airlift Wing sprayed insecticide over the area between September 28 and October 14. Using Ellington Field near Houston, Texas, as a hub,USAF aircraft also transported food, water, and other relief supplies to the victims of Hurricane Rita. The Air National Guard alone flew 27 stories, transporting 257 passengers and 90 tons of cargo. 95 In the 21st century, extensive forest fires, particularly in the west, con- tinued to break out and encourage states to seek federal assistance. In June 2002, fires southwest of Denver consumed some 90,000 acres and reached within ten miles of the city, forcing evacuations. Four C-130s, two eachfrom the 302d and 145th Airlift Wings (Air Force Reserve and AirNational Guard respectively), airdropped fire retardant liquid over theedges of the fires. They flew from PetersonAir Force Base in cooperation with the National Park Service's National Interagency Fire Center. Similar fires in the Simi Valley of southern California in October 2003, elicited asimilar operation. Eight C-130s, six from theAir National Guard and two from the Air Force Reserve Command, flew 48 missions and dropped almost 130,000 gallons of fire retardant. Again in October and November2004, California forest fires resulted in the airdropping of fire retardant by eight C-130s of the Air Force Reserve Command and the Air NationalGuard, again using the Modular Airborne Fire Fighting System. 96 WingsofHope A review of the most significant U.S. Air Force humanitarian airlifts supports several conclusions. The airlifts were a team effort that often demanded international and interdepartmental cooperation. The govern-ments of the afflicted nations and of the United States had to coordinate relief efforts, and the State and Defense departments had to integrateresponses, often through the National Security Council. Some airlifts required the military services within the Defense Department to work together: USAF transports, for example, might carry Army helicopters,engineers, equipment, and supplies. Various major commands within the Air Force, such as the Military Airlift Command, the Tactical Air Command, the United States Air Force Southern Command, the United States Air Forces in Europe, and the Pacific Air Forces, also had to coop- erate, as did the regular ,reserve, and Air National Guard forces. The airlifts also demonstrated the value of a large network of airfields, not only within the United States but abroad, in facilitating humanitarian relief. Although the sources of relief supplies were scattered across the 25nation, the proximity of runways made the loading of supplies easier. Overseas facilities also proved necessary. For example, bases in Panama refueled aircraft en route to South America. Airfields did not have to be located on bases, but they had to be available to military aircraft in an emergency, and they had to accommodate those aircraft with sufficient runways and fuel. Another factor that helped the flow of relief cargo was the stockpiling of emergency supplies at certain locations. A sharp reduc- tion in the number of U.S.Air Force bases at home and abroad could jeop- ardize America's ability to conduct the kinds of relief missions common during and after the Cold War. Civilian airports and airliners, already com- mitted to busy schedules, will not be able to respond to all of the future emergencies that natural and man-made disasters will inevitably cause. Throughout the forty-seven years between 1947 and 1994, the Cold War affected the willingness and ability of the United States to carry out relief operations. It provided large numbers of military cargo aircraft which, although designed to move troops and weapons into battle, couldalso transport relief supplies. America's confrontation with the Soviet Union also encouraged development of the organizational and logistical apparatus with which the United States responded to foreign emergencies, whether caused by conflict or natural calamity. Finally, the intense com- petition between the two superpowers for the loyalty of neutral nationsencouraged participation in relief operations when natural disasters struck underdeveloped nations. Without the Cold War, the Air Force might have lacked the airplanes, bases, and budgets to conduct more than 450 human- itarian airlifts in forty years. Ironically, preparation for war has generated many of the resources used to save lives. In the years since the Cold War, the United StatesAir Force continued flying global humanitarian missions, often as part of a larger Defense Department effort, because natural disasters such as earthquakes, hurri- canes, and tsunamis continued to break out all over the world. Hot wars and political crises continued to threaten civilian populations, particularly in unstable and underdeveloped parts of the world, long after the demise of the Soviet Union that was sometimes blamed for them. USAF commit- ments to combat operations around the world did not displace the capa- bility or the need for humanitarian airlift. In fact, sometimes the two would reinforce and complement each other. The need to airlift rotatingmilitary personnel, equipment, and supplies to combat theaters kept the Air Force ready and able to move relief personnel, evacuees, refugees, and relief cargo in response to humanitarian crises. Moreover, the pres- ence of substantial numbers of U.S. forces overseas often made resources more readily available for relief airlift in the same or nearby areas. Humanitarian airlifts called for large numbers and varieties of aircraft. The development of larger planes allowed more tonnage to be delivered by fewer flights, and bulky equipment and large quantities of supplies necessitated the use of large cargo planes. But in many areas hit by nat- 26ural disasters, small landing fields required modest-sized aircraft that were capable of landing on them. In some places, fixed-wing airplanes were unable to land at all, and helicopters were needed. If the defensebudget were reduced to the point where large numbers and varieties ofAir Force transports were no longer available, the United States might not be able to respond to humanitarian emergencies around the world. The humanitarian airlifts benefited both the nation receiving the aid and the United States. The victims of disaster obviously gained from thedelivery of food, medicine, clothing, bedding, shelters, and other supplies, and their governments were also able to rebuild devastated areas more rapidly with airlifted American equipment. However, the United States also profited from the airlifts by forging stronger bonds of goodwill and economic interdependence between itself and the afflicted nation, and by contributing to regional stability. Through its airlifts, the Air Force helps to insure friendly regimes in the world that will be receptive toAmericans politically, economically, and militarily. The relief operations also doubled as combat training. The delivery of hundreds of tons of humanitarian equipment, relief workers, and suppliesover thousands of miles in short periods of time prepared both air and ground crews for airlifting armored vehicles, weapons, and troops in case the emergency were war instead of natural disaster. The same skills Air Force personnel applied to relieving victims of natural disasters around the world would be needed in case of a wartime emergency in those very areas. Humanitarian airlift operations are not only an alternative to com-bat operations, but also a supplement to them. Above all, the humanitarian airlifts have demonstrated that Defense Department organizations have useful peacetime roles. Military opera-tions can kill, but they also save lives; they can injure, but they also heal; they can damage and destroy, but they also repair and rebuild. America will face many enemies in the future, including natural disasters such as floods, hurricanes, earthquakes, and blizzards. The United States Air Force has a tradition of meeting these challenges. With adequate support, that tradition will endure. 27Appendix SelectedU.S.AirForceOverseasHumanitarianOperations,1947-2007 Compiled by Christopher J. Bowie and updated by Daniel L. Haulman.
