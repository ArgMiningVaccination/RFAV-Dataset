In response to the recent concerns over the COVID-19 (coronavirus) and an active flu season, I would like to reassure you of the measures we take to protect your health and safety. Further, as a physician you have entrusted to serve as part of your healthcare team, I would like to remind you of some basic preventative practices you can implement to avoid contagious illnesses. At Three Kings Chiropractic we engage in daily and weekly cleaning routines to ensure a sanitary environment. We use disinfectant on hard surfaces, paying special attention to doorknobs, armrests, and examination tables, Our employees are instructed to wash hands and use hand sanitizer frequently. An employee who will have physical contact with a patient, sanitizes after entering the room and prior to any contact. An employee who exhibits symptoms of an illness is instructed to remain home. There are simple precautions you can take at home and work. The Centers of Disease Control (CDC) guidelines recommend avoiding close contact with people who are sick, staying home when you are sick, and coughing or sneezing into your arm. Perhaps the most effective way to avoid the spread of germs and viruses is frequent hand washing or hand sanitizing. Your ability to avoid illnesses is also highly contingent on your immune system. Keep your immune system strong by eating a healthy diet, staying hydrated, getting enough sleep, avoiding undue stress, and keeping up with your Chiropractic care. We are always available to address any questions or concerns you have. Thank you for trusting us to serve you and your families. In good health and prayers, Dr. Roland D. Cayer Many of you have called and asked if I recommend any supplements that can help maintain and strengthen a healthy immune system. I have always trusted and relied on Standard Process/Mediherb for all supplemental nutritional needs. Here is a general list of products that I recommend for immune support: Standard Process whole food supplements: - Immuplex - Cataplex A-C - Congaplex - Cataplex D - Epimune Complex - Brocafect Organic Herbs from Medi Herb and Standard Process - Echinacea Premium; liquid or tablet - Andrographis Complex - Myrrh Forte - Viranon - Astragalus Complex - Eleuthero; liquid or tablet; combines well with Echinacea Premium - Garlic Forte - Ganoderma & Shiitake Please call or email with questions.

Please follow the CDC's recommendations for containing the spread of this virus. It is important to remember that, as of right now, there is no approved pharmaceutical, vaccine, supplement or herb that will stop or cure this virus. "}
