The correct tool can be found at https:/ /www.ontario.ca/school-screening/. Staff, students, children, and visitors should screen every day before going to school or child care. Parent(s)/guardian(s) can fill this out on behalf of a child or student. Anyone who is feeling sick or has any new or worsening symptoms of illness, including those not listed in this screening tool, should stay home until their symptoms are improving for at least 24 hours (or 48 hours for nausea, vomiting, and/or diarrhea) and seek assessment from their health care provider if needed. All individuals are advised to wear a mask in crowded indoor public spaces, especially those at higher risk. Screening questions For questions 1, 2, and 3, you can choose \"No\" to all symptoms if both of these apply: Your symptoms have been improving for at least 24 hours (48 hours if you had nausea, vomiting, and/or diarrhea) and You do not have a fever. 1.Do you have any of these symptoms? Choose any or all that are new, worsening, and not related to other known causes or conditions.Fever and/or chills Yes No Cough Not related to other known causes or conditions (for example, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease) Yes No Shortness of breath Not related to other known causes or conditions (for example, asthma, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, chronic heart failure) Yes No Decrease or loss of taste or smellNot related to other known causes or conditions (for example, nasal polyps, allergies, neurological disorders) Yes No If you answered NO to all, skip to the next question. 1. Examples of immune compromise include cancer chemotherapy, untreated HIV infection with CD4 T lymphocyte count less than 200, combined primary immunodeficiency disorder, taking more than 20 mg/day (or equivalent) ofprednisone for more than 14 days, and taking other immune suppressive medications. For this screening tool, factorssuch as old age, diabetes and end-stage renal disease are generally not considered immunocompromised.2If you answered YES to any of the symptoms in question 1, do not go to school or child care and: Stay home (self-isolate) and do not attend school/child care until you do not have a fever and your symptoms have been improving for at least 24 hours (48 hours for nausea, vomiting, and/or diarrhea). Do not leave except to get tested, to visit a clinical assessment centre, or for a medical emergency. If you have severe symptoms like chest pain or difficulty breathing, go to the nearest emergency department. If COVID-19 testing is available and you are at higher risk of severe illness, you should get tested with 1 PCR or rapid molecular test (if eligible) or 2 rapid antigen tests taken 24 to 48 hours apart (the second test is not needed if the first one is positive). If you are at higher risk of severe illness, you should get tested as soon as possible given the time frame for receiving COVID-19 treatment. You may benefit from available therapies to prevent severe illness. At this time, a positive rapid antigen test result is sufficient to initiate COVID-19 treatment, for those who are eligible, and does not need to be confirmed by a PCR or rapid molecular test.

Additional precautions for 10 days after your symptoms started: wear a well-fitted mask in all public settings (including school and child care) avoid non-essential activities where you need to take off your mask (for example, playing a wind instrument in music class or removing your mask for sports; dining out) avoid visiting anyone who is immunocompromised or may be at higher risk of illness (for example, seniors) avoid non-essential visits to highest risk settings such as hospitals and long-term care homes Note: For those with negative COVID-19 test results, these additional precautions can be an added layer of prevention against the spread of COVID-19 and other respiratory viruses circulating in the community. Siblings and other people you live with should do the following for 10 days after their last exposure to the person with COVID-19 symptoms: self-monitor for symptoms. They should self-isolate immediately if they develop any symptom of COVID-19 and seek testing if eligible wear a well-fitted mask in all public settings (including school and child care) avoid non-essential activities where they need to take off their mask (for example, playing a wind instrument in music class or removing their mask for sports; dining out) avoid non-essential visits to anyone who is immunocompromised or who may be at higher risk of illness (for example, seniors) avoid non-essential visits to highest risk settings such as hospitals and long-term care homes Note: Regardless of any COVID-19 test results, these measures can be an added layer of prevention against the spread of COVID-19 and other respiratory viruses circulating in the community.

Additional health and safety tips The removal of provincial requirements does not mean that the risk for COVID-19 has disappeared. We still need to do our part to protect ourselves and others from COVID-19. This includes practicing good hand hygiene, frequently cleaning and disinfecting high-touch surfaces, and wearing a mask where recommended or required. Get the COVID-19 vaccine and other routine immunizations when eligible. Vaccines are safe, effective, and the best way to protect you and those around you from infectious diseases.
