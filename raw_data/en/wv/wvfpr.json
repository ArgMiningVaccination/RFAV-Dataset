As always, if you are feeling sick in any way, please use your best judgment in determining whether you should reschedule your appointment and/or mask at your appointment. Please inform me if you would prefer I wear my mask during your appointment and I will gladly do so! According to COVID ActNow, the community risk level for COVID 19 in Hennepin County is currently low, with .2 weekly COVID admissions per 100K and .6% patients with COVID of all hospital beds. For your continued safety and that of the community, all of the staff at Evren Chiropractic have received the most up to date COVID-19 vaccinations and boosters. Based on a comprehensive study from 33 U.S. sites from January to March 2021, the CDC reports two doses of Pfizer-BioNTech or Moderna vaccines to be 94% effective against symptomatic COVID-19. In accordance with the CDC physical infrastructure guidance for alternative care clinics, the staff at Evren Chiropractic operates according to the following COVID-19 protocol and planning considerations. Our responsibilities and commitments to you: Staff wear personal protective equipment (PPE) which consists of masks as needed/preferred and non-latex nitrile gloves as needed, and will diligently wash and sanitize hands to ensure proper hygiene and reduce transmission risk. The clinic is a large, open space with proper heat and cooling measures as well as two HEPA air purifiers which are powered on at all times in the clinic space in order to ensure proper air circulation to the space. Designated space for clean and dirty items are established and dirty items like towels, gowns and cotton face cloth are sealed properly until they are laundered. High traffic areas like the reception and high touch areas like the chiropractic adjustment and therapy tables are disinfected and cleaned following every patient treatment. Chairs in the clinic are all non-porous which allow them to be disinfected and cleaned effectively. Evren Chiropractic has a maximum capacity of 6 people including staff. If we have reached capacity, you may be asked to wait outside to avoid unnecessary risk to patients and staff. Virucidal spray is used to clean all surface areas and disinfectant wipes are used to clean chiropractic adjusting equipment. Staff will stay home and reschedule your appointment in the event they show signs and/or symptoms of illness. Your responsibilities and commitments to us: If you have tested positive for or have any signs or symptoms of COVID-19 like loss of taste or smell, fever, or sore throat within the last five days, we ask that you cancel/reschedule your appointment. Upon preference, you may or may not wear a cloth or surgical mask upon entering and being treated at the clinic. Hand sanitizer is available for all patients upon entering the clinic. Patients are encouraged to maintain six feet of social distance between one another and staff when not being treated. Adequate sinks for hand washing and hygiene are available in the Loring Corners building restroom near the clinic suite - ask your provider for the code to enter. Patients are asked not to arrive more than 5 minutes early for their appointment so that staff has the proper amount of time to clean and sanitize the space. Please review the COVID-19 consent form which will be emailed to you to fill out at your first visit. "}
