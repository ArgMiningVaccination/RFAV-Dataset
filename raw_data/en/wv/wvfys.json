These cases will generally occur when an opt-in Enrollment request is received late in a month with an effective date of the first of the next month. In these ca ses, DMAS or its authorized agent still must provide the E nrollee all materials described in \u00a730.4.1 of the Enrollment g uidance no later than 10 calendar days after receipt of the completed E nrollment request. Additionally, the Contractor is also strongly encouraged to call these new E nrollee s as soon as possible (within 3 calendar days) to provide the effective date, the information necessary to access benefits and to explain the MMP rules. The E nrollee 's coverage will be active on the effective date regar dless of whether or not the E nrollee has received all the information by the effective date. It is expected that all of the items outlined in \u00a730.4.1 of the Enrollment g uidance will be sent prior to the effective date for P assive E nrollment. 2.3.5. Disenrollment 2.3.5.1. The Contractor shall: 2.3.5.1.1. Have a mechanism for receiving timely information about all disenrollments from the MMP , including the effective date of disenrollment, from CMS and DMAS or its authorized agent . All disenrollment -related transactions will be perfor med by the DMAS or its authorized agent . Enrollees can elect to disenroll from the MMP or the Demonstration at any time and enroll in another MMP , a Medicare Advantage plan, PACE; or may elect to receive services through Medicare fee-for-service and a pres cription drug plan and to receive Medicaid services in accordance with the Virginia Medicaid State Plan and any waiver programs (if eligible) . Disenrollments received by DMAS or its authorized agent , or by CMS or its contractor , either orally or in writin g, by the last calendar day of the month will be effective on the first calendar day of the following month. 2.3.5.1.2.

Not interfere with the Enrollee's right to disenroll through threat, intimidation, pressure, or otherwise; 2.3.5.1.5. Not request the dis enrollment of any Enrollee due to an adverse change in the Enrollee's health status , unless they enter a hospice program, or because of the Enrollee's utilization of treatment plan, medical services, diminished mental capacity, or uncooperative or disrupti ve behavior resulting from his or her special needs. The Contractor, however, may submit a written request, accompanied by supporting documentation, to the CMT to disenroll an Enrollee, for cause, for the following reason: 2.3.5.1.5.1. The Enrollee's continued E nroll ment seriously impairs the Contractor's ability to furnish services to either t his Enrollee or other Enrollees , provided the E nrollee's behavior is determined to be unrelat ed to an adverse change in the E nrollee's he alth status, or because of the E nrollee' s utilization of medical services, diminished mental capacity, or uncooperative or disruptive behavior resulting from his or her special needs. 2.3.5.1.6. DMAS and CMS through the CMT will determine when and if the Contractor's request to terminate the E nrollment of an Enrollee will be granted based on the criteria in Section 2.3.5.1.4 above . DMAS and CMS will develop a process to evaluate disenrollment requests for Enrollees whose continued E nrollment seriously impairs the Contractor's ability to furnish services to this Enrolle e or other Enrollees. If DMAS and CMS determine that the Contractor too frequently requests termination of E nrollment for Enrollees, DMAS and CMS reserve the right to deny such requests and require the Contractor to initiate steps to improve the Contracto r's ability to serve such Enrollees. 2.3.5.2. Discretionary Involuntary Disenrollment: 42 C.F.R. \u00a7 422.74 and Sections 40.3 and 40.4 of the Medicare -Medicaid Plan Enrollment and 32 Disenrollment Guidance provides instructions to MMPs on discretionary involuntary dise nrollment. This Contract and other guidance provide procedural and substantive requirements the Contractor, DMAS , and CMS must follow prior to involuntarily disenrolling an Enrollee. If all of the procedural requirements are met, DMAS and CMS will decide whether to approve or deny each request for involuntary disenrollment based on an assessment of whether the particular facts associated with each request satisfy the substantive evidentiary requirements. 2.3.5.2.1.

Capitation R ate updates will take place on January 1 st of each calendar year or more frequently, as described in this section; however , savings percentages and quality withhold percentages (see Sections 4.1.4 and 4.2.5) will be applied based on Demonstration Years, as follows: 4.1.2.1.1. Demonstration Year 1: March 1 , 2014- December 31, 2015 4.1.2.1.2. Demonstration Year 2: January 1, 2016- December 31, 2016 4.1.2.1.3. Demonstration Year 3: January 1, 2017- December 31, 2017 4.1.3. Capitated Rate Structur e 4.1.3.1. Underlying Rate Structure for Medicaid Component of the Capitation Payment 4.1.3.1.1. DMAS shall pay the Contractor a monthly per member per month ( PMPM ) amount (the Medicaid Component) for each Demonstration region by rate cell as described below. 168 4.1.3.1.2. The baseline spending data for Medicaid services used for calculating the C apitation R ates is the most recent two -year historical fee -for-service data (cal endar years 2011 and 2012 for Demonstration Year 1) from the total population that would have been eligible for E nrollment in the Demonstration during the historical baseline period. Completion factors are calculated and applied to the baseline data, in or der to include expenditures for services that were incurred but not reported in the available data. The data are then adjusted for known policy and program changes that will be in effect during the contract period. The completed and adjusted data are tren ded forward to the midpoint of the Contract period and used to develop C apitation R ates. All steps in this process are subject to CMS review. 4.1.3.1.3. The C apitation P ayments are based on the rate cell structure and FIPS codes and are automatically generated by the DMAS information system at the rates established in this Contract. Any and all costs incurred by the Contractor in excess of the C apitation P ayment will be borne in full by the Contractor . Table 1: Medicaid Rate Cell Categories Rating Category Rate Cell Description Community Well Enrollees who do not meet a Nursing Facility Level of Care (NFLOC) standard or meet NFLOC standard and are currently in a nursing home for fewer than 20 days. Rates will vary by the following age gro ups: 21-64 and 65+ . Rates will vary for the five (5) D emonstration regions . 169 Rating Category Rate Cell Description Nursing Facility Level of Care Single rate cell for all individuals meeting a NFLOC including: a) Enrollees in the EDCD Waiver; b) Enrollees in a NF for twenty ( 20) or more consecutive days. An individual's ini tial screening to determine NFLOC will be conducted by a state- reimbursed, external preadmission screening team. Annual reassessment screenings for NFLOC will be conducted by the Contractor , but monitored by DMAS for quality assurance. Rates will vary by the following age groups: 21-64 and 65+. There will be a member Enrollment mix adjustment (MEMA) that will provide more revenue to MMPs that have a greater proportion of high risk/cost Enrollees (e.g. NF residents) compared to MMPs with a lower proportion of high risk/cost Enrollees (EDCD waiver). Once a NFLOC recipient is determined to no longer meet NFLOC criteria , the Contractor continues to receive the higher NFLOC C apitation R ate for two (2) full months f ollowing the determination. Beginning with the third month, the Contractor will receive the Community Well C apitation R ate. Rates will vary for the five (5) D emonstration regions . 4.1.3.1.4. Payment r ates for Enrollees who meet NFLOC will be blended, in order to fu rther the goal of providing services at the lowest appropriate setting and intensity level for each Enrollee. In order to provide adequate payment to the Contractor for their actual E nrollment mix, the blended rate cells will be risk adjusted using the ME MA as described further in Section 4.2.4. In general, the MEMA adjusts the blended rates, based on the proportion of the cohort receiving LTSS in a NF versus in the community. The MEMA will be calculated at the beginning of the rate period and recalculated at key times over the Demonstration C ontract periods . 4.1.3.2. Underlying Rate Structure for Medicare Component of the Capitation Rate 4.1.3.2.1. Medicare will pay the Contractor a monthly capitation amount for the Medicare Parts A/B services (the Medicare A/B Component), risk adjusted using the Medicare Advanta ge CMS -HCC Model and the CMS -HCC ESRD Model, except as specified in Section 4.2.4. Medicare will also pay the Contractor a monthly capitation amount for Medicare P art D services, risk adjusted using the Part D RxHCC Model (the Medicare Part D Component). 170 4.1.3.2.2. Medicare A/B Component 4.1.3.2.2.1. The Medicare baseline spending for Parts A/B services are a blend of the Medicare Advantage projected payment rates and the Medicare FFS standardized county rates for each year, weighted by the proportion of the target population projected to otherwise be in each program absent the Demonstration. The Medicare Advantage baseline spending will include costs that would have occurred absent the Demonstration, such as quality bonus payments for applicable Medicare Advantage plans. The FFS county rates will generally reflect amounts published with the April Medicare Advantage Final Rate Announcement, adjusted to fully incorporate more current hospita l wage index and physician geographic practice cost index information; in this Demonstration, this adjustment will be fully applied to the FFS county rates in 2014, but the adjustment will otherwise use the same methodologies and timelines used to make the analogous adjustments in Medicare Advantage. CMS may also further adjust the Medicare FFS standardized county rates as necessary to calculate accurate payment rates for the Demonstration. To the extent that the published FFS county rates do not conform wi th current law in effect for Medicare during an applicable payment month, and to the extent that such nonconformance would have a significant fiscal impact on the Demonstration, CMS will update the baseline (and therefore the corresponding payment rate) to calculate and apply an accurate payment rate for such month. Such update may take place retroactively, as needed. 171 4.1.3.2.2.2. Separate baselines will exist for Enrollees meeting the Medicare ESRD criteria. For Enrollees with ESRD in the dialysis or transplant status phases, the Medicare Parts A/B baseline will be the ESRD dialysis state rate. For Enrollees in the functioning graft status phase, the Medicare Parts A/B baseline will be the Medicare Advantage 3 .5% bonus county rate (benchmark) for the applicable county as of January 2015 (for CY 2014 the baseline was the 3 -star county rate) . 4.1.3.2.2.3. Both baseline spending and payment rates under the Demonstration for Medicare Parts A/B services will be calculated as PMPM standardized amounts for each county participating in the Demonstration for each year. Enrollee risk scores will be applied to the standardized rates at the time of payment. 4.1.3.2.2.4. The Medicare A/B Component will be updated annually consistent with annual Fee -for- Service (FFS) estimates and Medicare Advantage rates released each year with the annual rate announcement. 4.1.3.2.3. Medicare Part D 4.1.3.2.3.1. The Medicare Part D baseline for the Part D Direct Subsidy will be set at the Part D national average monthly bid amount (NAMBA) for the calendar year. CMS will estimate an average monthly prospective payment amount for the low income cost -sharing subsidy and f ederal reinsurance amounts; these payments will be reconciled after the end of each payment year in the same manner as for all Part D sponsors. The CY 2014 Part D NAMBA is $75.88. 4.1.3.2.3.2. The monthly Medicare Part D Component for an Enrollee can be calculated by multiply ing the Part D NAMBA by the RxHCC risk score assigned to the individual , and then adding to this estimated average monthly prospective payment amount for the low income cost - sharing subsidy and federal reinsurance amounts. 172 4.1.4. Aggregate Savings Percentages 4.1.4.1. Aggregate savings percentages will be applied equally, as follows, to the baseline spending amounts for the Medicare Parts A/B Component and the Medicaid Component of the capit ated rate, provided that such savings percentages may be adjusted in accordance with Section 4.1.4.2. 4.1.4.1.1. Demonstration Year 1: 1% 4.1.4.1.2. Demonstration Year 2: 1% 4.1.4.1.3. Demonstration Year 3: 2% 4.1.4.2. Rate updates will take place on January 1st of each calendar year, however savings percentages will be calculated and applied based on Demonstration Years. 4.1.4.3. Savings percentages will not be applied to the Part D component of the rate. CMS will monitor Part D costs closely on an ongoing basis. Any material change in Part D costs relative to the baseline may be factored into future year savings percentages. 4.1.5. Risk Adjustment Methodology 4.1.5.1. Medicare Parts A/B: The Medicare Parts A/B Component will be risk adjusted based on the risk profile of each Enrollee. Except as specified below the existing Medicare Advantage CMS -HCC and CMS -HCC ESRD risk adjustment methodology will be used for the Demonstration. 4.1.5.1.1. In calendar year 2014, CMS will calculate and apply a coding intensity adjustment reflective of all Demonstration Enrollees. This will apply the prevailing Medicare Advantage coding intensity adjustment proportional to the anticipated proportion of Demonstration Enrollees in 2014 with Medicare Advantage experience in 2013, prior to the Demonstration. 4.1.5.1.2. In calendar year 2015, CMS will apply an appropriate coding intensity adjustment r eflective of all Demonstration Enrollees; this will apply the prevailing Medicare Advantage coding intensity adjustment proportional to the anticipated proportion of Demonstration E nrollees in CY 2015 with prior Medicare Advantage experience and/or Demonstration experience based on the Demonstration's enrollment phase -in as of September 30, 2014. 173 4.1.5.1.3. After calendar year 2015, CMS will apply the prevailing Medicare Advantage coding intensity adjustment to all Demonstration Enrollees. 4.1.5.1.4. The coding intensity adjustment factor will not be applied during the Demonstration to risk scores for Enrollees with an ESRD status of dialysis or transplant, consistent with Medicare Advantage policy. 4.1.5.2. Medicare Part D: The Medicare Part D NAMBA will be risk adjusted in accordance with existing Part D RxHCC methodology. The estimated average monthly prospective payment amount for the low income cost - sharing subsidy and Federal reinsurance amounts will not be risk adjusted. 4.1.5.3. Medicaid: The Medicaid component will employ rating categories described in Section 4.1.3.1. In addition, a MEMA will be used. 4.1.5.4. The MEMA addresses the relative risk/cost differences of the sub - populations that make up the combined rate for individuals who meet NFLOC These two sub- populations are the NFLOC - FLOC populations. The MEMA will provide more revenue to MMPs that have a greater proportion of high risk/cost Enrollees residing in an institution (N FLOC -I) compared to MMPs with a lower proportion of these Enrolle es (NFLOC -W) and is calculated and applied in the method that follows: 4.1.5.4.1. Separate NFLOC Capitation R ates are developed for the two sub-populations of N FLOC individuals and then the two rates are combined to develop a weighted average rate using the Enrollme nt distribution of the most recent available month for the weight value. 4.1.5.4.2. A snapshot of the NFLOC Enrollment mix on January 1, 2014 of all Enrollees who are NFLOC and eligible for Enrollment into the Demonstration will be taken and used to establish the in itial NFLOC C apitation R ates. Each Enrollee will receive a risk score based on their placement on January 1, 2014. This risk score will be held constant through the first year of the D emonstration and may be updated in years two and three for continuous Enrollees . 4.1.5.4.3. This weighted average NFLOC capitation rate s will be paid to health plans for opt -in Enrollment beginning in March 1 , 2014 for Phase I and June 1, 2014 for Phase II. Contractor will continue to be paid this rate for 90 days past each phase's P assive E nrollment date. 174 4.1.5.4.4. An MMP -specific weighted risk score for each E nrollment phase will be calculated 90 days after the start of the P assive Enrollment effective date. For Phase I, that date is October 1, 2014; for Phase II, that date is January 1, 2015. 4.1.5.4.5. At the completion of 90 days past the start of the Passive Enrollment period for each phase, the weighted average Capitation R ate will be recalculated based on the risk scores for each Enrollee established before the start of the Demonstration, and the actual E nrollment of those individuals in each MMP at the 90- day mark. 4.1.5.4.6. DMAS will apply the updated weighted C apitation R ates on a prospective basis. 4.1.5.4.7. Those enrolled in the D emonstration through opt -in and Phase I and Phase II P assive E nrollment are considered the first cohort and their risk score w ill be updated and tracked separately from subsequent new Enrollees . Future calculations will adjust for first cohort members who leave the program, either voluntarily or as a result of dea th. 4.1.5.4.8. Risk scores will be established for new cohorts using the same methods as those described above, with the cohorts defined as those who entered the D emonstration during each 6-month period. This creates a series of cohorts that will be measured as of their date of entry to the program. Over the course of the Demonstration there would be several cohorts, all of which would be measured separately, then aggregated to establish the appropriate payment rate for each plan. 4.1.5.4.9. The MEMA adjustment will be budget neutral. 4.1.6. Medical Loss Ratio (MLR) 4.1.6.1. Medical loss r atio G uarantee: The Contractor has a target MLR of eighty - five percent (85%). 4.1.6.1.1. If the Contractor has an MLR between eighty -five ( 85) percent and ninety ( 90) percent of the joint Medicare and Medicaid payment, the Commonwealth and CMS may require the Contractor to submit a corrective action plan or remit an amount not to exceed twenty -five ( 25) percent of the difference between the actual MLR and 90% as defined below . Any collected remittance would be distributed proportionally back to the Medicaid and Medicare programs on a percent of premium basis. 175 4.1.6.1.2. If the MLR calculated as set forth below is less than the target MLR , the Contractor shall refund to DMAS and CMS an amount equal to the difference between the calculated MLR and the target MLR (expressed as a percentage) multiplied by the coverage year r evenue. DMAS and CMS shall calculate a MLR for Enrollees under this Contract for each coverage year, and shall provide to the Contractor the amount to be refunded, if any, to DMAS and CMS respectively. Any refunded amounts will be distributed back to the Medicaid and Medicare programs, with the amount to each pay or based on the proportion between the Medicare and Medicaid Components. At the option of CMS and DMAS, separately, any amount to be refunded may be recovered either by requiring the Contractor to make a payment or by an offset to future Capitation Payment . The MLR c alculation shall be determined as set forth below; however, DMAS and CMS may adopt NAIC reporting standards and protocols after giving written notice to the Contractor. 4.1.6.2. MLR will be ba sed on the 42 C.F.R. \u00a7\u00a7 422.2400 et seq and 423.2400 et seq except the numerator in the MLR calculation will include: 4.1.6.2.1. All Covered Services required in the Demonstration under Section 2.4 and Appendix A ; 4.1.6.2.2. Any services purchased in lieu of more costly Covered Services and consistent with the objectives of the CCC; and 4.1.6.2.3. Care Coordination Expense. That portion of the personnel costs for c are c oordinators whose primary duty is direct Enrollee contact that is attributable to this Contract shall be included as a benefit expense. The portion of the pe rsonnel costs for Contractor's medical director that is attributable to this Contr act shall be included as a benefit expense. 4.1.6.3. The revenue used in the MLR calculation will consist of the Capitation Payments due from DMAS and CMS for services provided during the coverage year . Revenue will include amounts withheld pursuant to Section 4.2.5, regardless of whether the Contractor actually receives the amount in Section 4.2.5. 4.1.6.4. Data Submission. The Contractor shall submit to DMAS and CMS, in the form and manner prescribed by the Department and CMS, the necessary data to calculate and verify the MLR after the end of the coverage year . 176 4.1.6.5. Medical Loss Ratio Calculation. W ithin ninety (90) days following the six (6) month claims run- out period following the coverage year , DMAS and CMS shall calculate the MLR by dividing the benefit expense by the revenue. The MLR shall be expressed as a percentage rounded to the second deci mal point. The Contractor shall have sixty (60) days to review the MLR c alculation. Each Party shall have the right to review all data and methodologies used to calculate the MLR . 4.1.6.6. Coverage Year. The coverage year shall be the demonstration year. The MLR c alculation shall be prepared usi ng all data available from the coverage y ear, including IBNP and six (6) months of run- out for benefit expense (excluding sub- capitation paid during the run- out months). 4.2. Payment Terms 4.2.1. The Medicare Parts A/B Component wil l be the product of the Enrollee's CMS - HCC risk score multiplied by the relevant standard county payment rate (or the ESRD dialysis state rate or the Medicare Advantage 3 -star country rate by the HCC ESRD risk score, as applicable). The Medicare Part D Co mponent will be the product of the Enrollee's RxHCC risk score multiplied by the Part D NAMBA , with the addition of the estimated average monthly prospective payment amount for the low income cost -sharing subsidy and f ederal reinsurance amounts. Enrollee contribution to care amounts will be deducted from the Medicaid Component of the monthly C apitation P ayment amount, in accordance with Section 4.4.3. 4.2.2. Timing of Capi tation Payments 4.2.2.1. CMS and DMAS will each make monthly C apitation P ayments to the Contractor. If an individual is enrolled with the Contractor on the first day of a month, the Contractor has the responsibility of providing covered services to that Enrollee for that month, even if the Enrollee moves to another locality. If the Enrollee moves to a locality outside of the Contractor's S ervice A rea, the Enrollee will be disenrolled from the Contractor at the end of the month that the move is confirmed . Any and all costs incurred by the Contractor in excess of the C apitation P ayment will be borne in full by the Contractor. The Contractor shall accept the Department's electronic transfer of funds to receive C apitation P ayments. 4.2.2.2. Enrollments 4.2.2.2.1. CMS will make monthly Capitation to the Contractor. The PMPM C apitation P ayment for a particular month will reflect payment for the beneficiaries with effective E nrollment into the Contractor's MMP as of the first day of that month, as described in Section 2.3. 177 4.2.2.2.2. DMAS will make monthly PMPM Capitation P ayments to the Contractor retrospectively for the previous month's Enrollment (e.g., payment for June enrollment will occur in July, July payment will be made in August, etc.). The PMPM Capitation P ayment for a particular month will reflect payment for the beneficiaries with effective E nrollment into the Contractor's MMP a s of the first day of the previous month. 4.2.2.3. Disenrollments 4.2.2.3.1. The final PMPM Capitation P ayment made by CMS and DMAS to the Contractor for each Enrollee will be for the month: a) in which the disenrollment was submitted, b) the Enrollee loses eligibility, or c ) the Enrollee dies (see Section 2.3). 4.2.3. Enrollee Contribution to Care Amounts - Patient P ay for Medicaid Long Term Supports and Services 4.2.3.1. When an E nrollee's income exceeds an allowable amount, he or she must contribute toward the cost of their LTSS. This contribution, known as the Patient P ay amount, is required for individuals residing in a NF and for those receiving EDCD services. Patient P ay is required to be calculated for every individual receiving NF or waiver services, alt hough not every eligible individual will end up having to pay each month. 4.2.3.2. DMAS will provide information to the Contractor that identifies Enrollees who are required to pay a Patient Pay amount and the amount of the obligation as part of the monthly transi tion report . DMAS C apitation Payments to Contractors for individuals who are required to pay a Patient Pay Amount will be net of the monthly Patient Pay amount. The Contractor shall develop policies and procedures regarding the collection of the Patient Pay obligation. The MMP may collect it directly from the Enrollee or assign this responsibility to LTSS providers. If i t is the responsibility of the LTSS provider(s) to collect the Patient Pay amount s from Enrollees, the Contractor shall reduce reimburs ements to LTSS providers equal to the Patient Pay amount s each month. The Contractor must use DMAS' method for assigning Patient Pay collection to LTSS providers unless an alternate methodology is approved by DMAS . 178 4.2.3.2.1. For EDCD W aiver services, the provider wi th the most authorized hours is considered the primary service provider and is responsible for the collection of the P atient Pay amount. If the most authorized hours are for consumer directed (CD) services, the patient pay amount must be deducted from the CD personal care attendant's payroll by the F/EA. The Contractor will need to establish communication and reporting mechanisms with the F/EA. Respite care providers are responsible for collecting the Patient P ay only when respite care is the sole authori zed LTSS . When an individual enrolled with the Contractor is determined to be newly eligible for LTSS , the Contractor shall submit a DMAS -225 form to the local D SS eligibility worker, in order for the eligibility worker to determine the Patient P ay amount. The Contractor shall establish a process to ensure collection of the P atient P ay amounts and coordinate with LTSS service providers. 4.2.3.2.2. DMAS -225 Form 4.2.3.2.2.1. The Medicaid LTC Communication Form (DMAS -225) is used by the D SS to inform providers of Medicai d eligibility and to exchange information. The Contractor or its designee must ensure that a completed DMAS - 225 is in the record of each individual receiving nursing facility or EDCD Waiver services. 4.2.4. Modifications to Capitation Rates 4.2.4.1.1. DMAS and CMS may pr opose modifications, additions, or deletions to the rate cell structure over the course of the Demonstration. Any modifications to the rate cell structure will be subject to agreement by the other governmental party. DMAS and CMS will inform the Contracto r of such changes to the rate cell structure in writing, and the Contractor shall accept such changes. 179 4.2.4.1.1.1. Rates will be updated using a similar process for each calendar year. C hanges to the Medicare and Medicaid baselines (and therefore to the corresponding payment rate) outside of the annual Medicare Advantage rate announcement and Medicaid rate process will be made only if and when CMS and DMAS jointly determine the change is necessary to calculate accurate payment rates for the Demonstration. For changes solely affecting the Medicare program baseline, CMS will consult with DMAS prior to making any adjustment, but DMAS concurrence will not be required. Such changes may be based on the following factors: shifts in E nrollment assumptions; major changes or dis crepancies in federal law and/or s tate policy used in the development of baseline estimates; and changes to coding intensity . CMS and/or DMAS will make changes to baseline estimates within thirty ( 30) days of identification of the need for such changes, and changes will be applied, if necessary on a retrospective basis, to effectuate accurate payment rates for each month. 4.2.4.1.2. Changes to the savings percentages will be made if and when CMS and DMAS jointly determine that changes in Part D spending have resulted in materially higher or lower savings that need to be recouped through higher or lower savings percentages applied to the Medicare A/B baselines. 180 4.2.4.1.3. In the event that one -third of MMPs experience losses in Demonstration Year 1 exceeding three ( 3) percent of revenue over all regions in which those plans participate, based on at least twenty ( 20) months of data from Demonstration Year 1, the savings percentage for Demonstration Year 3 will be reduced to three ( 3) percent In the event that one -third of MMPs show MMLRs below ninety ( 90) percent over all regions in which those plans participate, CMS and DMAS will review the MMP financial reports, encounter data, and other information to assess the ongoing financial stability of the MMP and the appropriateness of C apitation P ayments. At any point, DMAS may request that CMS review documentation from specific plans to assess the appropriateness of C apitation R ates and identify any potential prospective adjustments that would ensure the rate -setting process is meeting the objective of Medicare and Medicaid jointly financing the costs and sharing in the savings. 4.2.5. Quality Withhold Policy for Medicaid and Medicare A/B Components of the Integrated, Risk- Adjusted Rate 4.2.5.1. Under the Demonstra tion, both CMS and DMAS will withhold a percentage of their respective components of the Capitation R ate, with the exception of Part D C omponent a mounts . The withheld amounts will be repaid subject to the Contractor's performance consistent with established quality thresholds. 4.2.5.2. CMS and DMAS will evaluate the Contractor's performance according to the specified metrics required in order to earn back the quality withhold for a given year. 4.2.5.3. Whether or not the Contractor has met the quality requirements in a gi ven year will be made public . 4.2.5.4. Additional details regarding the quality withholds, including more detailed specifications, required thresholds and other information regarding the methodology will be made available in separate technical guidance. 4.2.5.5. Withhold Me asures in Demonstration Year 1 181 4.2.5.5.1. Table 2 below identifies the withhold measures for Demonstration Year 1. Because Demonstration Year 1 crosses calendar and Contract years, the Contractor will be evaluated to determine whether it has met required quality withhold requirements at the end of both CY 2014 and CY 2015. The determination in CY 2014 will be based solely on those measures that can appropriately be calculated based on the actual E nrollment volume during CY 2014. Consistent with such evaluations, the withheld amounts will be repaid separately for each calendar year.

DMAS may suspend payments to Contractor in accordance with 42 CFR \u00a7 455.23as determined necessary or appropriate by DMAS . 4.3. Transitions between Rating Categories and Risk Score Changes 4.3.1. Rating Category Changes 4.3.1.1. The Medicaid Component of the Capitation Rates will be updated following a change in an Enrollee's status relative to the rate cells in Section 4.1.3. On a monthly basis, as part of C apitation P ayment processing, the rating category of each Enrollee will be determined. Individuals who are in a NF for twenty ( 20) days or more and 186 Enrollees who are in a waiver based on the E nrollment status in the DMAS eligibility file will be in the nursing home eligible rating category. All others will be in the community well category. 4.3.2. Medicare Risk Score Changes 4.3.2.1. Medicare CMS -HCC , HCC -ESRD, and RxHCC risk scores will be updated consistent with prevailing Medicare Advantage regulations and processes. 4.4. Reconciliation 4.4.1. CMS and DMAS will implement a process to reconcile E nrollment and Capitation P ayments for the Contractor that will take into consid eration the following circumstances: 4.4.1.1. Transitions between RCs; 4.4.1.2. changes in eligibility, RCs, or Enrollee contribution amounts; 4.4.1.3. Changes in CMS -HCC and RxHCC scores; and, 4.4.1.4. Changes through nrollment, or 4.4.2. The reconci liation may overpayments to the Contractor. 4.4.3. Medicaid Capitation Reconciliation 4.4.3.1. Retroactive adjustments to E nrollment and payment shall be forwarded to the Contractor as soon as possible upon receipt of updated/corrected informa tion. The Contractor shall cover retroactive adjustments to Enrollment without regard to timelines of the adjustment. The Contractor shall assure correct payment to providers as a result of E nrollment updates/corrections. DMAS shall assure correct payment to the Contractor for any retroactive E nrollment adjustments. 4.4.3.2. DMAS will reconcile payments related to the MEMA adjustment on a periodic basis. 4.4.4. Medicare Capitation Reconciliation 4.4.4.1. Medicare capitation reconciliation will comply with prevailing Medicare Advantage and Part D regulations and processes. 4.4.5. Audits/Monitoring 4.4.5.1. CMS and DMAS will conduct periodic audits to validate RC assignments or other coding. Audits may be conducted by a peer review organization or other entity assigned this responsibility by CM S and DMAS. 187 4.5. Payment in Full 4.5.1. The Contractor must accept, as payment in full for all Covered Services, the Capitation R ate(s) and the terms and conditions of payment set forth herein. 4.5.2. Notwithstanding any contractual provision or legal right to the contrary, the three (3) parties to this Contract (CMS, DMAS and the Contractor), for this Demonstration agree there shall be no redress against either of the other two (2) parties, or their actuarial contractors, over the actuarial soundness of the Capitation R ates. 4.5.3. By signing this contract, the Contractor accepts that the C apitation R ate(s) offered is reasonable; that operating within this C apitation R ate(s) is the sole responsibility of the Contractor; and that while data is made available by the Federal Government to the Contractor, any entity participating in the Demonstration must rely on their own resource to project likely experience under the Demonstration. Section 5. Addition al Terms and Conditions 5.1. Administration 5.1.1. Notification of Administrative Changes 5.1.1.1.

B.1.3.2 ADHC services are designed to prevent institutionalization by providing Enrollees with health, maintenance, and rehabilitation services in a congregate daytime setting. The significant difference between ADHC and personal care is the congregate setting in which ADHC is rendered. The plan shall enter into participation a greements with qualified adult day care centers which are licensed by the Virginia DSS. B.1.3.3 The services offered by the ADHC Center must be designed to meet the needs of the Enrollee . Thus, the range of services provided by the ADHC Center to each Enrollee may vary to some degree.

Personal care services are defined as direct assistance with and supervision of ADLs and instrumental activities of daily living (IADLs) and monitoring of health status and physic al condition. Personal care is available as either agency -directed (AD) or consumer -directed (CD). B.1.4.2 The unit of service for personal care services is one hour. In the current DMAS EDCD Waiver program, payment is available only for allowable activities tha t are authorized and provided by a qualified provider in accordance with an approved P OC when the Enrollee is present. Personal care services are limited to the hours specified in the P OC. The 2011 Virginia General Assembly approved budget bill language (I tem 297 CCCCC) requires DMAS to develop and implement a 56 hour per week cap for personal care services under the EDCD Waiver. DMAS has implemented exception criteria for those Enrollees who require more than 56 hours per week of personal care services. B.1.4.3 Personal assistance services include assistance with ADLs such as: bathing, dressing, transferring, and, toileting. This service does not include skilled nursing services, with the exception of skilled nursing tasks that may be delegated pursuant to the Virginia Administrative Code 18 VAC 90- 20-420 through 18 VAC 90- 20- 460.
