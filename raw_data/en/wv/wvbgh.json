Discover the benefits of Vitamin C and what is more effective, oral or IV?", "sitename": "Drip IV Therapy + Mobile Hydration", "date": "2020-01-08", "cleaned_text": "What is Vitamin C? Vitamin C is a water-soluble vitamin that acts as an antioxidant in the body. It increases collagen production and is essential for boosting the immune system. It also plays a crucial role in preventing cell damage caused by free radicals. Free radicals are unstable atoms that can damage cells, causing illness and aging. High levels of vitamin C have been associated with a lowered risk of heart disease, hypertension, and stroke. Humans, unlike some animals, cannot synthesize vitamin C by themselves, so it must be ingested in another manner. Luckily it is easy enough to find in dietary supplements, IV infusions, and is readily available in many foods. Vitamin C is abundant in fruits and vegetables such as citrus, guavas, strawberries, bell peppers, kale, etc. IV or Oral Supplements? High doses of vitamin C taken orally do not have the same effect as an intravenous dose because much of it cannot be harnessed by the body and is expelled through urine, making it an ineffective method. The body regulates the intestinal absorption of vitamin C. Taking a high-dose of intravenous vitamin C increases the bioavailability that the body can use for biological processes such as healing itself. When it is infused directly into the bloodstream, it bypasses the digestive and metabolic system and has a 100% absorption rate by cells. Benefits of High-Dose Vitamin C IV Therapy Vitamin C has long been recognized as a potent vitamin and antioxidant that can aid with a myriad of health problems and promote healing in the body. High-dose vitamin C IV therapy is an ideal way to boost the body's immune system and have the optimum amount of this powerful antioxidant. Vitamin infusions are a great way to prevent illness, treat infections, and acute or chronic health conditions. Wound Healing Vitamin C helps the body form and maintain connective tissue, bones, skin, and blood vessels. This means that high doses of vitamin C infused intravenously can aid the body in healing wounds, cuts, and scrapes on skin faster. This is also because vitamin C is an antioxidant that helps repair tissue and reduces damage caused by inflammation. Better Skin The high antioxidant properties and its role in collagen production make vitamin C an essential component of skin health. The free radical fighting powers of vitamin C make it necessary for keeping skin from premature aging and keeping wrinkles away. When taken in an IV infusion, it is doubly beneficial because the added fluids in an IV serve to hydrate the skin and improve the absorption of vitamin C. Strong Immune System People with high levels of vitamin c in their immune system are better equipped to fight off infections such as a cold or the flu. Vitamin C also encourages the production of white blood cells that the body uses to protect against disease. High-doses of vitamin C may not be able to \"cure\" a cold but it has been shown as helpful in reducing the length and severity of the illness. Low levels of vitamin C have been linked to diseases such as scurvy. Improved Iron Absorption Iron is an essential nutrient for transporting oxygen throughout the body and for making red blood cells. Vitamin C aids in transforming Iron that isn't absorbed into a form that can be used by the body. This can help reduce the risk of anemia in people with iron deficiency. [In one study published](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/10799377) on PubMed, taking vitamin C with a meal increased iron absorption by 67%. Improved Mood People with a vitamin C deficiency can feel fatigued and depressed, but even those with adequate vitamin C levels can experience these moods. A high-dose of IV vitamin C can significantly improve mood by fighting against free radicals that cause oxidative stress. Oxidative stress in the body can cause neuropsychological disorders like depression and anxiety. Reduced Lead Toxicity An increase in lead in the body has been linked to Alzheimer's disease and lead poisoning, but a megadose of vitamin C is an effective [treatment in repairing the damage](https://www.seanet.com/~alexs/ascorbate/197x/klenner-fr-j_int_assn_prev_med-1974-v1-n1-p45.htm). Studies on both children and adults have shown that a higher vitamin C intake results in lowered blood lead levels. High Blood Pressure One in three Americans suffers from high blood pressure, which can put the body at risk for heart disease. Hypertension, another name for high blood pressure, can be reduced by taking high-doses of vitamin C. Vitamin C has been shown to reduce both systolic and diastolic blood pressure in adults. Cancer Therapy Aid High doses of vitamin C protect the body from oxidative stress that can damage cells. Researchers have found that using vitamin C in conjunction with chemotherapy and other cancer rehabs may be able to [improve the effectiveness](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3798917/) of these treatments. Further research is still being conducted on this therapy. As shown by these benefits above, vitamin C is a super vitamin that can help the body in multiple ways. Much of modern medicine focuses on reacting to a disease or a sickness but doesn't focus on the best way to avoid getting sick - prevention! Vitamin C aids in the prevention of diseases, aging-related illnesses, and is also helpful in repairing the damage that has already occurred to cells.
