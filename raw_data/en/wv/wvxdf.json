At this time, the seasonality of COVID- 19 is not known, and it has not yet been determined whether people will need a COVID -19 booster at a set time period (e.g., every 6 months). This guidance outlin es current recommendations for 'staying up to date', based on age and health status . Health equity remains a cornerstone and a priority of Ontario's COVID- 19 vaccine program. Sustained c ulturally safe and community centred efforts need to be prioritized to: 1.Ensure ongoing access to vaccines for Indigenous, racialized , and marginalized populations disproportionately affected by COVID- 19 due to disparities in the Social Determinants of Health including systemic barriers to accessing health care ; and 2.promote people remaining up to date with their COVID -19 vaccines - both for primary series and booster doses . Primary Series Recommendations 1.NACI recommends bivalent Omicron -containing Pfizer -BioNTech or Bivalent Moderna) be used to initiate or complete the primary series for all individuals 6 months and older , without contraindications to the vaccine, as outlined in These recommendations are interim and were made considering only the currently available bivalent mRNA COVID -19 vaccines, which are authorized for use as a primary series. Future recommendations will consider new product options as regulatory decisions are made. Consistent with NACI recommendation s on vaccine interchangeability, regardless of which product is offered to start aprimary series, the previous dose should be counted; the series should be continued and not restarted. If a primary series is started with an original mRNA vaccine, a bivalent Om icron -containing vaccine can be used to complete the series. If a primary series is started with a bivalent Omicron - containing mRNA vaccine and the same product is not readily available tocomplete the series, another bivalent Omicron -containing mRNA vaccine2. Table 1 and 6 | Pagemay be used to complete the series. Bivalent products available in Ontario include in Ontario, as bivalent Moderna BA.1 has b een fully phased out. Please see Table 1 for more inf ormation on product recommendations by age, dosage and schedules (recommended and minimum intervals). 2.Novavax COVID- 19 vaccine (protein subunit vaccine) may be offered to individuals who are 12 years and older , without contraindications to the vaccine , who are not able or willing to receive an mRNA COVID- 19 vaccine. 3.Astra Zeneca, Medicago and Janssen COVID -19 vaccines are no longe r being used in Ontario . A longer interval between doses of a COVID -19 vaccine, for both primary series and booster doses, results in a more robust and durable immune response and higher vaccine effectiveness . A longer interval between doses may also be associated with lower risk of myocarditis and/or pericarditis in adolescents and young adults. See the Canadian Im munization Guide for more information . Additionally, individuals with a confirmed SARS -CoV -2 infection should also delay vaccination to ensure appropriate vaccine efficacy ( Table 3). These intervals are a guide and clinical discretion is advised . Primary Series Recommendations for Moderately to Severely Immunocompromised Individuals An extended primary series is recommended for certain moderately to severely immunocompromised individuals 6 months of age and older with the aim of enhancing the immune response to vaccination and establishing an adeq uate level of protection for individuals who may develop a sub -optimal immune response to the standard two dose primary series. An extended primary series constitutes administration of an additional dose to complete the primary series. See the COVID -19 chapter in the Canadian Immunization Guide: Immunocompromised persons for more informat ion. oAs per NACI, moderately to severely immunocompromised individuals 6 months to 4 years may be offered a primary series that includes anadditional dose of an mRNA COVID- 19 vaccine (3 doses), whereas moderately to severely immunocompromised individuals 5 years and older should receive a primary series that includes an additional dose of an mRNA COVID -19 vaccine (3 doses).7 | PageoIndividuals 6 months and older who are moderately to severely immunocompromised may benefit from a primary series with bivalent Moderna (25 mcg in 6 months -11 years and 50 mcg in those 12 years and older) compared to bivalent Pfizer (10 mcg in 5 - 11 years and 30 mcg in those 12 years and older). oFor individuals 12 to 29 years of age , the bivalent Pfizer (30 mcg) vaccine is preferred due to the lower risk of myocarditis and/orpericarditis, however, for some moderately to severely immunocompromised individuals, administration of the bivalent Moderna(50 mcg) may be considered based on individual clinician judg ement and informed consent. An extended primary series is recommended for the following populations : oIndividuals receiving dialysis (hemodialysis or peritoneal dialysis) oRecipients of solid -organ transplant and taking immunosuppressive therapy oIndivid uals receiving active treatment9 (e.g., chemotherapy, tumour or malignancies oRecipi antigen receptor (CAR) -T-cell therapy or hematopoietic stem cell transplant (within 2 years of transplantation or taking immunosuppression therapy) oIndividuals with moderate to severe primary immunodeficiency (e.g.,DiGeorge syndrome, Wiskott- Aldrich syndrome) oHIV with AIDS -defining illness in last 12 months before starting vaccine series, or se vere immune compromise with CD4 count <200 cells/uL or CD4 percentage <15%, or without HIV viral suppression oIndividuals receiving active treatment with the following categories ofimmu nosuppressive therapies: anti -B cell therapies10 (monoclonal 9 Active treatment includes patients who have completed treatment within 3 months. Active treatment is defined as chemotherapy, targeted therapies, immunotherapy, and excludes individuals receiving therapy that does not suppress the immune system (e.g., solely hormonal therapy or radiation therapy). See Ontario Health/Cancer Care Ontario's Frequently Asked Questions for more information. 10 Active treatment for patients receiving B -cell depleting therapy includes patients who have completed treatment within 12 months. 8 | Pageantibodies targeting CD19, CD20 and CD22), high -dose systemic corticosteroids (refer to the Canadian Immunization Guide for suggested definition of high dose steroids), alkylating agents, antimetabolites, or tumor -necrosis factor (TNF) inhibitors and other biologic agents that are significantly immunosuppressi ve (Appendix D ). It is recommended that re -vaccination with a new COVID- 19 vaccine primary series be initiated post -transplantation for hematopoietic stem cell transplant (HSCT), hematopoietic (autologous or allogeneic), andrecipients of CAR -T-cell therapy given the loss of immunity following therapy or transplant. 11 Optimal timing for re -immunization should be determined on a case - by-case basis in consultation with the clinic al team. For additional information on organ transplantation, consult the Canadian Society of Transplantation statement on COVID -19 vaccination. For additional information on rheumatic diseases, consult the Canadian Rheumatology Association statement on COVID -1 9 vaccination. For additional information on inflammatory bowel disease, consult the Canadian Association of Gastroenterolo gy statement on COVID -1 9 vaccination. For additional information on immunodeficiency conditions, consult the COVID-19 resources on the Canadian Society of Allergy and Clinical Immunology webpage. For frequently asked questions about COVID -19 vaccine s and adult cancer patients, consult Cancer Care Ontario . The safety and efficacy of the Novavax COVID -19 vaccine has not been established in individuals who are immunocompromised due to disease or treatment. As such, eligible individuals who choose to be immunized with the Novavax COVID -19 vaccine should be informed that there is currently limited evidence for use of these vaccines in this population. Individual clinical discretion should be used when offer ing an additional dose of Novavax to immunocompromised individuals as part of an extended primary series . 11 As per the Canadian Immunization Guide , HSCT recipients should be viewed as vaccine na\u00efve (i.e., never immunized) and require re- immunization after transplant. 9 | PageBooster Doses Recommendations and Staying Up to Date Staying Up to Date12 For those 6 months - 4 year s, means having a completed primary series . Booster doses are not currently recommended for this age group. For those 5 years and older , means completion of the primary series and receipt of the current ly recommended booster dose . Booster dose s are recommended for all eligible populations based on the ongoing risk of infection due to waning immunity, the ongoing risk of severe illness from COVID -19, the societal disruption that results from transmission of infections, risk of post -COVID conditio n or post -acute COVID syndrome (PCC), and the adverse impacts on health system capacity from the COVID- 19 pandemic. Individuals are recommended to receive a bivalent mRNA COVID- 19 vaccine for their booster dose s due to the strong protection offered and wel l-established safety and effectiveness data COVID -19 available in Ontario target the original COVID- 19 virus and the BA.4/5 Omicron sub - variants. A booster dose should be offered 6 mo nths (168 days) after a previous COVID -19 vaccination or confirmed SARS -CoV -2 infection.13 While the recommended interval is 6 months, vaccine administrators can use their use their clinical discretion based on individual circumstances. The closer the timing is to the optimal 6-month interval, the better ; evidence shows that the antibody response is higher with longer intervals between infection and vaccination and between vaccine doses. 12 This definition is based on NACI recommendations for COVID -19 vaccine booster doses, however, is subject to change as the COVID -19 pandemic evolves. 13 A confirmed SARS -CoV -2 infection is characterized by positive result obtained using a molecular (e.g., PCR) or Health Canada approved rapid antigen test OR symptomatic disease co mpatible with COVID -19 AND a household exposure to a confirmed COVID -19 case. Individuals 5 years and older should consider delaying receipt of a COVID -19 vaccine booster until Fall 2023. 10 | Page Population- Level Recommendations Currently, there are no booster products authorized by Health Canada for infants and children 6 months to 4 years; these individuals are not eligible for a booster dose at this time. Effective the week of July 7th, 2023, individuals 5 years and older should consider delaying receipt of a COVID -19 vaccine booster until F all 2023. Receiving a booster dose in the F all, as resp iratory season commences, will maximize protection against COVID -19 when peak circulation of the virus is expected. The decision to receive a booster dose prior to F all 2023 may be appropriate for certain individuals based on their unique health status and personal situation. Individuals should be encouraged to speak with their health care provider. Booster dose s of Novavax COVID- 19 vaccine (protein subunit vaccine ) may be offered to individuals who are 18 years and older without contraindications to the vaccine and who are not able or willing to receive an mRNA COVID -19 vaccine . As part of informed consent, individuals who are not able or willing to receive an mRNA vaccine should be made aware of the long -term effectiveness and sa fety data that is available for the mRNA vaccine products as compared to the other authorized COVID- 19 vaccines ( CIG, 2022 ). Co-Administration Individuals 6 months and older, may receive a COVID- 19 vaccine simultaneously with (i.e., same day), or at any time before or after non -COVID -19 vaccines (including live and non- live vaccines). Informed consent should include a discussion of the benefits and risks given the limited data available on administration of COVID- 19 vacci nes at the same time as, or shortly before or after, other vaccines . If vaccines must be co -administered, immunization on separate limbs is recommended , however if the same limb must be used, the injection sites should be separated by at least 2.5 cm (1 in ch). The exception to this is the Imvamune \u00ae vaccine provided for mpox . If vaccine timing can be planned, it is recommended to wait at least 4 weeks before or after administration of an Imvamune\u00ae vaccine . However, the administration of Imvamune\u00ae as pre - or post -exposure vaccination should not be delayed in an individual who has recently received a COVID -19 vaccine. These suggested waiting periods are precautionary but may help prevent erroneous attribution of an AEF I to one particular vaccine or the other. Please refer to Mpox Vaccine (Imvamune\u00ae) Guidance for Health Care Providers . 11 | Page Studies to assess safety and im munogenicity of concurrent administration of COVID -19 vaccines with other vaccines are ongoing. Recommended Intervals Between Previous SARS- CoV -2 Infection and COVID -19 Vaccination The Ontario Ministry of Health, in alignment with NACI , c ontinues to recommend that COVID- 19 vaccines should be offered to individuals with previous SARS -CoV -2 infection without contraindications to the vaccine. Below are suggested intervals between previous SARS- CoV -2 infection and COVID -19 vaccination. Table 3 : Suggested Interval s between SARS- CoV -2 Infection and COVID- 19 Vaccination SARS- CoV -2 Infection timing relative to COVID - 19 vaccination P opulation R ecommended Interval Infection prior to completion or initiation of primary series I ndividuals 6 months and older who are not considered moderately to severely immunocompromised and with no previous history of multisystem inflammatory syndrome in children and adults (MIS -C and MIS -A) 8 weeks (56 days) after symptom onset or positive test (if asymptomatic) Individuals 6 months and older who are moderately to severely immunocompromised and with no previous history of MIS -C and MIS - A 4 to 8 weeks (28 to 56 days) after symptom onset or positive test (if asymptomatic) Individuals 6 months and older with a history of MIS -C and MIS -A (regardless of immunocompromised status) Re ceive vaccine dose when clinical recovery has been achieved or 90 days since the diagnosis of MIS -C and MIS -A, whichever is longer 12 | Page SARS- CoV- 2 Infection timing relative to COVID - 19 vaccination Population Recommended Interval Infection after primary series Individuals currently eligible for booster dose(s) Receive vaccine dose 6-month s (168 day) after previous COVID -19 infection (characterized by positive test or after having symptoms post contact with someone who had a positive test) 14. *A previous infection with SARS -CoV -2 is defined as: Confirmed SARS -CoV -2 infection using a molecular (e.g., PCR) or Health Canada- approved rapid antigen test; or Symptomatic disease compatible with COVID -19 AND a household exposure to a confirmed COVID -19 case. These suggested intervals are based on immunological principles and expert opinion, and may change as evidence on COVID -19, variants of concern (VOCs), and COVID -19 vaccines emerge. When considering whether or not to administer vaccine doses accor ding to the intervals outlined in this table, biological and social risk factors for exposure (e.g., local epidemiology, circulation of VOCs, living settings) and risk of severe disease should also be taken into account. These intervals are a guide and cli nical discretion is advised. In accordance with provincial guidance , in dividuals who have symptoms of COVID- 19 or other infectious agents should self -isolate , including COVID -19 vaccine clinics, until the following criteria are met: Sy mptoms have been improving for at least 24 hours (or 48 hours if na usea, vomiting and/or diarrhea were present) No fever There has not been development of additional symptoms 14 Please refer to the Booster Doses Recommendations and Staying Up to Date se ction for guidance on current booster recommendations. 13 | Page These suggested waiting times are intended to minimize the risk of transmission of COVID -19 and other respiratory or gastrointestinal pathogens at an immunization venue and to enable monitoring for COVID -19 vaccine adverse events following immunization (AEFI) without potential confounding from symptoms of COVID- 19 or other co- existing illnesses. COVID -19 Vaccine Precautions & Population Specific Consi derations See the COVI D - 19 Vaccine: Canadian Immunization Guide's se ction on Contraindicatio ns and Precautions for recommendations for individuals with bleeding disorders, immune thrombocytopenia, venous thromboembolism, thrombosis with thrombocytopenia syndrome, myocarditis -Barr\u00e9 syndrome and B ell's palsy. Myocarditis & Pericarditis following vaccination with an mRNA COVID -19 vaccine There have been Canadian and international reports of myocarditis (inflammation of the heart muscle) and pericarditis (inflammation of the lining around the heart) following vaccination with COVID -19 mRNA vaccines. Global experience to date has indicated that the majority of reported cases have responded well to conservative th erapy (rest, treatment with non -steroidal anti -inflammatory drugs (NSAIDS)) and tend to recover quickly. Symptoms hav e typically been reported to start within one week after vaccination. C ases of myocarditis/pericarditis following COVID- 19 mRNA vaccination occur more commonly in adolescents and young adults (12 to 29 years), more often after the second dose and more ofte n in males than females. Safety surveillance data from the US suggests that the risk of myocarditis or pericarditis is lower in children 5 to 11 years following monovalent Pfizer -BioNTech (10 mcg) vaccination compared to adolescents and young adults (who r eceived a monovalent Pfizer -BioNTech 30 mcg dose). Among children 5 to 11 years, very rare cases were most often reported following dose 2 and among males. Post- market safety surveillance is ongoing ( NACI, 2022). P roviders are encouraged to consult the enhanced epidemiologic surveillance summary from Public Health Ontario fo r trends and risk of myocarditis/pericarditis following mRNA vaccines in Ontario. NACI continues to strongly recommend that a complete series with an mRNA COVID -19 vaccine be offered to all eligible individuals in Canada, including those 5 years and older. 14 | Page The benefits of vaccination with COVID -19 vaccines continue to outweigh the risks of COVID -19 illness and related, possibly severe outcomes for all age groups. Anyone receiving an authoriz ed mRNA COVID -19 vaccine should be informed of the risk of myocarditis and pericarditis, and advised to seek medical attention if they develop symptoms including chest pain, shortness of breath, palpitations (pounding or heart racing), or feeling of rapid or abnormal heart rhythm ( NACI ). In most circumstances, and as a precautionary measure until more information is available, individuals with a diagnosed episode of myocarditis (with or without pericarditis) within 6 weeks of receipt of a previous dose of an mRNA COVID -19 vaccine should d efer further doses of the vaccine. This includes any person who had an abnormal cardiac investigation including electrocardiogram (ECG), elevated troponins, echocardiogram or cardiac MRI after a dose of an mRNA vaccine. This is a precaution based on recommendations issued by the National Advisory Committee on Immunization (NACI) i n the Canadian Immunization G uide. NACI, Public Health Ontario (PHO), and the Ontario Ministry of Health (MOH) are following this closely and will update this recommendation as more evidence becomes available. In situations where there is uncertainty regarding myocarditis diagnosis, discussion should occur with an appropriate physician or nurse practitioner on potential options for (re)immunization with the same or alternative COVID- 19 vaccine, including a risk -benefit analysis for the individual. Those with a history compatible with pericarditis and who either had no cardiac workup or had normal cardiac investigations, can receive the next dose once they are symptom free and at least 90 days has passed since vaccination. Some people with confirmed myo carditis with or without pericarditis may choose to receive another dose of vaccine after discussing the risks and benefits with their health care provider. Individuals can be offered the next dose once they are symptom free and at least 90 days has passed since vaccination. If another dose of vaccine is offered, they should be offered the bivalent Pfizer - BioNTech (30 mcg) vaccine due to the lower reported rate of myocarditis and/or pericarditis when offered as part of the primary series. Informed consent should include discussion about the unknown risk of recurrence of myocarditis and/or pericarditis following receipt of additional doses , as well as the need to seek immediate medical assessment and care should symptoms develop. o For more information consult Public Health Ontario's Myocarditis and Pericarditis Following COVID -19 mRNA Vaccines resource. 15 | Page o Interim clinical guidance and an algorithm for the identification and management of myocarditi s and pericarditis following mRNA COVID -19 vaccination in children is available from the Hospital for Sick Children. o A clinical framework is also available from the Canadian Journal of Cardiology Myocarditis and Pericarditis following COVID -1 9 mRNA Vaccination: Practice Considerations for Care Providers Multi -Inflammatory Syndrome in Children or in Adults (MIS -C/A) follow ing vaccination with an mRNA COVID -19 vaccine Children and adolescents with SARS -CoV -2 infection are at risk of multisystem inflammatory syndrome in children (MIS -C), a rare but serious syndrome that can occur several weeks following SARS -CoV -2 infection. Very rare cases of MIS -C/A (multisystem inflammatory syndrome in children and in adults) have been reported following vaccination with COVID -19 mRNA vaccines in Canada and internationally among individuals aged 12 years and older. However, on October 29, 2021, the European Medical Association Pharmacovigilance Risk Assessment Committee (EMA -PRAC) issued a statement that there is currently insufficient evidence on a possible link between mRNA COVID -19 vaccines and very rare cases of MIS -C/A. For c hildren or adults with a previous history of MIS -C or MIS -A, respectively, unrelated to any previous COVID- 19 vaccination, vaccination should be postponed until clinical recovery has been achieved or until it has been 90 days since diagnosis, whichever i s longer. Bell's palsy following vaccination with an mRNA COVID -19 vaccine Very rare cases of Bell's palsy (typically temporary weakness or paralysis on one side of the face) have been reported following vaccination with COVID- 19 mRNA vaccines (Pfizer -BioN Tech or Moderna) in Canada and internationally among individuals 12 years and older. Bell's palsy is an episode of facial muscle weakness or paralysis. The condition is typically temporary. Symptoms appear suddenly and generally start to improve after a fe w weeks. The exact cause is unknown. It's believed to be the result of swelling and inflammation of the nerve that controls muscles on the face. Symptoms of Bell's palsy may include: uncoordinated movement of the muscles that control facial expressions, su ch as smiling, squinting, blinking or closing the eyelid loss of feeling in the face 16 | Page headache tearing from the eye drooling lost sense of taste on the front two- thirds of the tongue hypersensitivity to sound in the one ear inability to close an eye on one side of the face Individuals should seek medical attention if they develop symptoms of Bell's palsy following receipt of mRNA COVID -19 vaccines. Health care providers should consider Bell's palsy in their evaluation if the patient presents with clinically compatible symptoms after an mRNA COVID- 19 vaccine. Investigations should exclude other potential causes of facial paralysis. History of Allergies See the COVID -19 Vaccine: Ca nadian Immunization Guide for information on vaccination for all individuals with allergies (including those with allergic reactions to previous doses of any COVID -19 vaccine, or vaccine components). People who experienced a severe immediate allergic reaction after a dose of an mRNA COVID -19 vaccine can safely receive future doses of the same or another mRNA COVID -19 vaccine after consulting with an allergist/immunologist or another appropriate physici an. See the CIG for more information. As per the Canadian Society of Allergy and Clinical Immunology , i ndividuals with a suspected history of adverse reactions to tromethamine, including suspected history of systemic allergic reactions to radiocontrast media and ketorolac, may receive vaccines containing tromethamine (CSACI, 2023) . Individuals with known allergies to components of the vaccines may speak with an appropriate physician or nurse practi tioner (NP) for evaluation. This assessment will enable the development of a vaccination care plan which may include receiving the vaccine under the supervision of your physician. Documentation of the discussion with the physician/NP may be provided to the immunizing clinic and can include a vaccination care plan , including the parameters the clinic should meet to provide safe vaccination administration, such as availability of advanced medical care to manage anaphylaxis) ; details/severity of the previous a llergic episode(s) ; confirm ation that appropriate counselling on the safe administration of vaccine has been provided ; and the date, the clinician's name, signature and contact information , as well as the individual's name and date of birth. 17 | Page Symptoms, either current or displayed recently, of chest pain or shortness of breath Vaccine should not be offered to persons displaying current or recent history of chest pain or shortness of breath. Pe rsons displaying current or recent history of chest pain or shortness of breath should consult with a health care provider prior to vaccination and/or if symptoms are severe, should be directed to the emergency department or instructed to call 911. Side effects COVID -19 vaccines, like medicines and other vaccines, may cause side effects. In clinical trials, most of the side effects experienced were mild to moderate, and usually resolved within a few days . Please see the individual product monographs for a complete list of reported side effects. History of Fainting/Dizziness or Fear of Needles Individuals with a history of fainting/dizziness, or fear of injections/needles can safely receive the COVID -19 vaccine. Considerations may include: Immunize while seated to reduce injuries due to fainting, If considered high- risk, immunize while lying down . These individuals may bring a support person. CARD (C- Comfort, A -Ask, R- Relax, D- Distract) is an evidence -based framework that can help with vaccination. See CARD resources to support immunization Pregnant or Breastfeeding COVID -19 vaccination during pregnancy is effective at protecting pregnant indiv iduals against severe COVID -19 disease, hospitalization, and ICU admission from COVID -19 infection, as well as intubation and mortality in those with severe disease. Pregnant or breastfeeding individuals should receive all recommended COVID -19 vaccine doses as soon as they are able. In addition, to protecting the pregnant individual, the benefits of immunization during preg nancy for the fetus have also been well -documented. Protective antibodies are transferred to the fetus transplacentally, resulting in increase d protection for the infant during the early postnatal period (CIG, 2023). 18 | Page Recommendations for vaccination during pregnancy and/or breastfeeding: A COVID -19 vaccine may be offered at any stage of the pregnancy (i.e., in any trimester). COVID -19 vaccines may be co -administered with other vaccines recommended during pregnancy or while breastfeeding. NACI strongly recommends that i ndividuals who are pregnant or breastfeeding who have not yet begun or completed the primary series should be o ffered the recommended doses to complete the primary series . Pregnant and breastfeeding individuals are also encouraged to be up to date with booster doses. There have been no serious safety concerns with receiving an mRNA COVID -19 vaccination during pre gnancy or lactation. Pregnant or breastfeeding individuals experience the same rates of expected local and systemic adverse events as individuals who are not pregnant and/or breastfeeding. Vaccination during pregnancy does not increase risk of miscarriage, stillbirth, low birth weight, preterm birth, NICU admission or other adverse pregnancy/birth outcomes. Similarly, studies have not found any negative impact of vaccination on the child being fed human milk or on milk production or excretion. For additional resources, individuals who are pregnant and/or breastfeeding can access the Provincial Council for Maternal and Child Health's decision making tool , the Society of Obstetricians and Gynaecologists of Canada Statement on COVID- 19 Vaccination in Pregnancy , Canadian Immunization Guide a nd the NACI Updated guidance on COVID -19 vaccines for individuals who are pregnant or breastfee ding . Adverse Events Following Immunization An adverse event following immunization (AEFI) is defined as any unexpected medical occurrence (e.g., unfavourable or unintended sign, abnormal laboratory finding, symptom or disease) following administration of an active immunizing agent (CIG, 2023) . This event does not necessarily have a causal relationship with the use of a vaccine . 19 | Page Guidance on reporting adverse events following immunization (AEFI) for health care providers Health care providers administering vaccines are required to inform vaccine recipients or their parent/guardian of the importance of reporting adverse events following immunization (AEFIs) to a health care provider in accordance with Section 38 of the Health Protection and Promotion Act (HPPA) . Vaccine recipients or their parent/guardian may also contact their local public health unit to ask questions or to report an AEFI . Specified health care provi ders (e.g., physicians, nurses and pharmacists) are required under s.38(3) of the HPPA to report AEFIs to their local public health unit. Re ports should be made using the Ontario AEFI Reporting Form . See Public Health Ontario's vaccine safety webpage and Fact Sheet - Adverse Event Following Immunization Reporting For Health Care Providers In Ontario for additional guidance. The Ontario Ministry of Health in collaboration with Public Health Ontario monitors reports of AEFIs. This monitoring is done in collaboration with the Public Health Agency of Canada and Health Canada. All health care providers ad ministering vaccines must be familiar with the anaphylaxis protocols for their clinic sites and ensure availability of anaphylaxis management kits. For additional information please visit the Public Health Ontario resource on th e Management of Anaphylaxis Following Immunization in the Community a nd the Canadian Immunization Guide . Those administering vaccines should ensure that vaccine recipients or their parents/guardi ans are advised to notify clinic staff, or if they have left the clinic, call their doctor/nurse practitioner or go to the nearest hospital emergency department if they develop any of the following symptoms: Hives Swelling of the face, throat or mouth Altered level of consciousness/serious drowsiness Trouble breathing, hoarseness or wheezing High fever (over 40oC or 104oF) Convulsions or seizures Other serious reactions (e.g., \"pins and needles\" or numbness) 20 | PageA reduced post- vaccination observation period, between 5 to 15 minutes may be considered for the administration of booster dose(s) of COVID -19 vaccine during the pandemic, if specific conditions are met such as the client's past experience with C OVID -19 vaccine doses and other relevant conditions a s outlined in the NACI 2020 -2021 influenza vaccine advice. This would be an exception to usual immunization guidance (i.e., a 15 minute post -vaccination observation period) and this approach could be used in specific settings (i. e., mass immunization clinic, primary care clinics, pharmacies) at this time on a temporary basis, weighing the risks of a reduction in observation period (e.g., small increased risk of delayed identification of an adverse event that may require immediate medical attention) and reducing risk of SARS -CoV -2 transmission where physical distancing cannot be maintained and allowing more individuals to be immunized in a given time period. Out of Province Vaccines If an individual has completed the primary series with a Health Canada approved COVID-19 vaccine and/ or non- Health Canada approved vaccine listed on the World Health Organization's (WHO) COVID -19 Va ccine Emergency Use Listing (EUL) (Appendix A ) a ccording to the recommended schedule, their primary vaccine series is considered complete. I ndividuals 5 years of age and older who have completed the primary series with either a Health Canada or WHO EUL COVID- 19 primary vaccine series are eligible for a bivalent mRNA COVID -19 booster dose if 6 months ha ve passed since their last vaccine dose or confirmed SARS -CoV -2 infection13. If an individual ha s completed o r partially c ompleted their pr imary s eries w ith a vaccine that is neither H ealth Canada a pproved no r WHO EUL , additional d oses of a Health C anada approved will be required to co mplete the ir primary vaccine series , unless the i ndividual has received 3 doses of thi s vaccine , in which case, their pr imary s eries i s considered c omple te. To co mplete the pr imary se ries: I mmunocompetent or immunocompromised (5 years and older): 3 OOP vaccines - do not need any additional Health Canada approved doses. Immunocompetent (5 years and older) : who received either one or two doses of an OOP vaccine, administer one Health Canada approved doseIndividuals 5 years and older should cons ider delaying receipt of a COVID -19 vaccine booster until Fall 2023. 21 | PageoReceived one OOP vaccine: need two Health Canada appro ved vaccines oReceived two OOP vacci nes: need one Health Canada approved vaccine It is recommended to administer Health Canada approved dose(s) at a recommended 56 -day interval since the previous dose or at a minimum of 28 days in order to complete the primary series. If this scenario arises for an individual who is 6 months to 4 years, contact the COVID -19 guidance team at the MOH for further clinical direction. Individuals who have received COVID -19 v accines outside of Ontario or Canada should contact their local public health unit to have their COVID- 19 immunization record documented in COVaxON. Proof of immunization15 (e.g., an immunization record, proof of vac cination certificate) is required to verify the COVID -19 vaccine product received out of province.16 PHUs are responsible for documenting immunization information for individuals who have received COVID- 19 vaccine doses outside of Ontario into COVaxON. See the COVaxON job aid and functionality change communications for more information. COVID -19 Vaccine Errors and Deviations *Please note: PHAC and OIAC have not yet updated the following documents to reflect NACI's interim recommendations on use of bivalent mRNA COVID-19 vaccines for use in the primary series. For guidance on managing COVID -19 vac cine administration errors and deviations, please see the Government of Canada's Planning guidance for immunization clinics for COVID -19 vaccines: Managing vaccine administration errors or deviations and the Ontario Immunization Advisory Committee's (OIAC) Recommendations: Management of Age -Rela ted COVID -19 Vaccine Administration Errors . 15 See Canadian Immunization Guide section on Immunization records. 16 The Canadian Immunization Guide outlines that vaccination should only be considered valid if there is written documentation of vaccine administration. Immunocompromised (5 y ears and older): need a total of three vaccine doses to complete the series: 22 | Page Where there is conflict between the two resources above, please refer to OIAC recommendations. For inadvertent immunization errors and deviations that are not addressed in the documents linked above and/or that involve multiple errors or have additional complexity, health care providers are encouraged to contact their local public health unit (PHU) for further advice. The local PHU should be notified, and vaccine administration errors or deviations should be handled and reported in accordance with both the site (if non -PHU) and PHU procedures. Vaccine administration errors and deviations that should be escalated to the Ministry of Health include those that m ay result in public safety concerns, cause misinformation, serious adverse events or death to any person; where large volumes of vaccine doses have been impacted or wasted; or where there is inadvertent administration of exposed and/or expired vaccine to a large number of patients. When in doubt, err on the side of caution and notify the Ministry of Health. For all issues that are escalated to the Ministry of Health, please report these per the following protocol: Email the Ministry of Health Communications team ( media.moh@ontario.ca) and the Implementation team ( covid.immunization@ontario.ca), with the following header: In cident Report for [PHU/Site] on [ Date]: o Description of Incident o Date of Incident: o Location of Incident: o Type of Incident: o Administration error or deviation: o Description of Incident: o Summary of action and steps taken to- date: o Next steps: If an inadvertent vaccine administration error or d eviation results in an adverse event following immunization (AEFI), complete Ontario's AEFI reporti ng form , including details of the error or deviation.
