Introduction and Background Basic Facts on Spinal Pain Low back pain has been the leading cause of years lived with disability since 1990 and remains a significant global public health concern Prevalence of low back pain is about 7.5% of the global population at any given point. Low back pain is not usually associated with a specific identifiable pathoanatomical cause. 85 -95% of people presenting to primary care providers do not have an identifiable pathoanatomical origin for their pain Low back pain is the leading cause of global disability. Disability from LBP has increased in all age groups between 1990 and 2019. Age 50 -54 was the largest group Factors associated with LBP and disability include: old age, poor general health, socioeconomic deprivation, income, occupational factors, psychological stressorsBasic Facts Continued Source: International Association For the Study of Pain University Washington School of Medicine Institute for Health Metrics 2016 data shows that low back and neck pain generated the highest expenditures at $134.5 Billion. Diabetes $112.1 B, Heart Disease $89.3B Overall MSK disorders expenditure was estimated $380B American Chiropractic Association Leading cause of disability worldwide. One of leading causes of missed work. 50% of all working Americans admit to having back pain symptoms each year 264 million lost work days annually 80% of the population will experience back pain at some point in their livesThe Role of Chiropractic in NMSK Conditions Primary care / portal of entry for NMSK conditions of the spine, but not limited to the spine Chiropractic training is a 4 year doctorate program with intensive training in basic sciences, anatomy and physiology, neurology, physical examination, pathology, biomechanics, radiology, physical medicine and rehabilitation, diverse manipulation techniques of the spine and extremities, and soft tissue treatment techniques Rigorous National Board of Chiropractic Examiners certifications during training and upon completion Recognized in all 50 states and US Territories.

American College of Physicians issued updated guidelines in 2017 for treating low back pain. Their recommendations include spinal manipulation, massage, acupuncture for both acute and sub -acute LBP . Chronic LBP included the same modalities but also non -drug therapy such as exercise, multidisciplinary rehab, stress reduction, tai -chi, yoga, low level laser therapy, CBT, and more. Drug therapies should be used as a last resort with NSAIDs first, tramadol and duloxetine as second resort, and opioids as an absolute last resort. Interestingly, steroids were not recommended.

Done on a case -by-case basis depending on the patient. What are the biggest needs ? What gaps in care are not being met ? What does the CoC team hear and see from these individuals, their care providers, families? What health goals would hopefully be accomplished with IM care at the CFL?Chiropractic for Cerebral Palsy Extensive literature on joint mobilization / soft tissue mobilization to address joint and myofascial contractures. It may not be termed chiropractic, but we are trained and skilled at many forms of manual therapy on the spine and extremities. This is also true of myofascial therapy techniques Since CP has many different levels of involvement and complexity, and because it is an upper motor neuron disorder it is not curable. The goal is to help improve tissue function and QOL as much as possible More research is certainly indicated and warranted Cerebralpalsy.org : This organization has very detailed information with some of the research and descriptions of how CMT can benefit CP patients \"Although there is little in the way of formal studies on the effects of chiropractic care for use on persons with CP , there are reports in the chiropractic community that purport improvements for the following conditions: Arthritis, back pain, breathing, drooling (release of TMJ muscles, gait patterns, hypertonic musculature, joint pain or stiffness, muscle contractures, neck pain, pain and tension, scoliosis, seizures, sleep difficulties, and other MSK conditions\"Chiropractic for Cerebral Palsy https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5106424/ https://chiro.org/Conditions/Cerebral_Palsy.shtml These hyperlinks direct to the available papers but there is need for more research. With respect to chiropractic manipulation there are thousands of studies for spinal manipulation but for not for specific diseases with comorbidities and disorders that fall under ID and DD. To provide noninvasive and non or even less pharmacologic pain relief to patients with NMSK pain has clinical merit. It is worth trying and worth investigating with the team at CFL. If IM treatments can help improve QOL, reduce stress, and reduce some of the burdens that these individuals and their families face, it is a net positive. Additional Points to Consider The hope would be that by matching the right ID /DD patient with the right providers and with correctly selected modalities, there would be reductions in pain issues, a need for less medication, less emotional and psychological distress, improvements in diet and nutrition, and perhaps lower medical costs. There might also be ancillary benefits for family members tasked with caring for their loved ones The same goals for the ID/ DD population as with the general population. It is worth pursuing. Having a structured, integrated approach that the CFL can uniquely offer under one roof is far more ideal than trying to piecemeal these therapies across the greater ABQ environment at numerous officesChris M. Early in my career, I treated a young man severely impacted with Mixed Type CP who was 18 when his parents brought him to my office. He was confined to a wheelchair, and he was mostly able to use a hand control for the WC. He was mostly aphasic but could make facial expressions and utter a few monosyllabic words. He drooled quite a bit. He was either grade IV or a V on the GMFCS scale which put him as severely impacted as it can be. He had severe scoliosis and subsequent Herrington rod and pedicle screw surgery when he was 15 or 16 from T1 through his lumbar spine. He required 24/7/365 care by his parents, and he was as involved a patient as I have ever seen He had a great deal of agitation and became very vocal by grunting when he was in pain or was uncomfortable Many spastic adhesions throughout all 4 limbs and tremendous myofascial adhesions/ scar tissue throughout his entire posterior chain. Chris M. Given the complexity of this young man's health, major spinal fusion, and mostly non - verbal means of communicating, one would not necessarily think that chiropractic care could help or would even be indicated. His parents were desperate to try anything that could help make him more comfortable, and perhaps them as well. We had to lift him from his wheelchair and get him positioned on my treatment table which was quite a process. His contractures and being wheelchair bound left him in near constant discomfort or pain. This was hard to quantify, and our communications were mostly through eye contact and by palpation of his body. I did a tremendous amount of myofascial therapy, instrument assisted percussion - based manipulation, stretching, and joint mobilization of all four limbs. He would let out groans of satisfaction and would smile and laugh whenever we worked together. It was obvious he greatly enjoyed the treatments and the stress relief for his parents cannot be overstated. We worked together twice weekly for 2.5 years and to this day it has been among the most memorable and meaningful patient experiences of my career. Other Conditions AUTISM / ASD Journal of Clinical Chiropractic Pediatrics : Editorial (jccponline.com) A systematic review of the literature on the chiropractic care of patients with autism spectrum disorder -PubMed (nih.gov) Massage therapy for children with autism spectrum disorders: a systematic review -PubMed (nih.gov) The Efficacy and Safety of Acupuncture for the Treatment of Children with Autism Spectrum Disorder: A Systematic Review and Meta -Analysis -PubMed (nih.gov) Takeaways: While there have been many studies done with CAM therapies, the conclusions are similar in that results are inconclusive, and that further research is warranted. There are countless non peer reviewed websites and different organizations that list anecdotal benefits to CAM therapies. Many practitioners in our field have treated individuals across the ID / DD spectrum of disorders and I can add my name to this also. Many therapies may not have the level I, peer reviewed data for IM / CAM therapies in the ID / DD population but they suffer with many of the same problems as the general population. Maybe they suffer a bit differently and convey it differently, but it is worth exploration at the CFL. The team of providers from medical doctors, chiropractors, acupuncturists, and massage therapists, working together can provide more options.Continued I speak from over 15 years of clinical experience of treating complex patients with many co -morbidities that IM and CAM therapies provide far better benefits when done in some combination than as stand -alone modalities. It should also be stressed that we do not treat ASD or CP...or ID, but rather we treat the person with ASD or CP, or ID. We cannot cure these disorders, but we can help improve pain, improve QOL, help improve stress and distress, and hopefully find more non pharmacologic or noninvasive ways of helping these individuals. I spoke with a patient of mine who is a psychotherapist that works extensively with ID and DD patients, and she plainly said \" They have problems just like the rest of us!\" I think this was helpful to me as I attempted to put my presentation together for the CoC on a difficult at first topic, but in practicality, may not be as difficult as it would appear. We will not know unless we try!Q &A How can I be of service to your group ? What questions do you have for me about Chiropractic?
