Eat clean and nourish yourself with whole, unadulterated foods that contain the intelligence of nature to increase vitality, vigor, alertness. Ween out sugars and processed foods. Incorporate detoxifying whole foods into your diet including dark leafy greens, veggies, beets, apples, avocado, artichokes, seaweed, garlic, sesame seeds too. Try adding a fresh veggie juice or super food smoothie to your daily routine. No. 2: Hydrate & Cleanse Hydration is key. Keep your body healthy with plenty of water. Try adding a few drops of doTERRA citrus oils like Lemon, Wild Orange, Slim & Sassy or Ginger to your water, juice or smoothies to assist internal cleansing too. Leslie starts each day with warm water and lemon oil and it has transformed her gut health, metabolism, digestion and pre-hydrates her for the day. Our gut health and digestion has a direct effect on our overall health both physically, mentally and emotionally. A healthy belly helps us to assimilate food properly and digest our experiences, emotions and life on a sensory level as well. No. 3: Nature Reboot Spend time outside, feel the warm sunshine on your skin, breathe in the sweet summer air. Time in nature has a healing and purifying effect on the mind, body and soul. Exercise is also great tool to stimulate your circulatory and lymphatic system and clear out the heaviness and stress in the body. Nature fuels the soul, connecting to the vastness and beauty fosters expansion and growth in our lives. No. 4: Clean Green Make over your cleaning routine, keep your house chemical free. Cut out the harmful and harsh chemical products and make DIY household cleaners with essential oils that are healthy for yourself and loved ones. Clean and purify the air by using OnGaurd, Purify or Citrus Oils in the Diffuser. Get lighter and declutter, donating anything you no longer need to those in need. It's amazing how much clearer you can think when your closet and house is free of clutter. No. 5: Be Mindful Incorporate a mindful practice into your daily routine, a time to be present, reflect, connect. This could be taking a moment to breathe consciously each day, yoga, meditation, journalling, coloring, creating, Abhyanga self massage, watching the sunset or taking a walk. Find a practice that help you to connect your mind, body and soul, to fall in love with life everyday. No. 6: Digital Detox All the screen time in our lives can overwhelm our senses and wear on the health of our brain, eye-sight, vitality, sleep patterns. Take a break from the screens and \"unplug\" one hour before bed for better sleep. Be mindful to balance your screen time daily with more nourishing activities like quality time in nature, connecting with friends and family, reading, creating, setting an intention or any of the other mindful practices.
