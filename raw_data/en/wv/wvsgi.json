In the following article I aim to recount my experiences during my third year elective in homeopathy. Homeopathy dates back about 200 years, when Dr. Hahnemann proposed the \"Law of Similars\"\u2014the basic tenet of homeopathy. All homeopathic remedies are based on this law and are produced via the process of potentization\u2014repeated dilutions and succussions of a substance, usually until there is no active ingredient remaining. The remedies are selected by matching their known symptoms with the characteristic symptoms of the patient. Homeopaths consider not only the current symptoms but also constitutional symptoms such as the patient's personality, temperament, and his or her social, occupational, and family history. Homeopaths spend a considerable amount of time with new patients in order to get a complete history, and these long consultative sessions are a definite benefit of homeopathy. After spending some time in this elective, I believe that homeopathy could be a welcome adjunct to allopathy in order to provide patients with the most comprehensive care possible.
