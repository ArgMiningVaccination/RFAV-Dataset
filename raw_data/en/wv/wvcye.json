Asian Journal of Pediatric Research 2021 Aims: Human papillomavirus (HPV) infection is the most common sexually transmitted infection globally. Vaccination is effective in preventing HPV-associated cancers and is recommended for children at ages 11-12; however, the vaccination rate is suboptimal. Credible information about HPV vaccine in social media will help the public make effective healthcare decisions. This study analyzed YouTube videos about HPV vaccine. Study Design: Descriptive study. Place and Duration of Study: Videos in English posted on YouTube during 2006-2020. Methodology: We used purposive sampling to select and conduct a quantitative content analysis of 151 YouTube videos that met the criteria. An instrument including video characteristics and theoretical constructs of the Health Belief Model was used to code the videos. Three researchers independently coded the data; another three verified the accuracy. The team discussed discrepancies until reaching a consensus. We conducted descriptive and inferential s... Medical Informatics and Decision Marketing 2021 Background: Institutions, government departments, and healthcare professionals engage in social media because it facilitates reaching a large number of people simultaneously. YouTube provides a platform whereby anyone can upload videos and gain feedback on their content from other users. Many YouTube videos are related to health and science, and many people search YouTube for health-related information. YouTube has been acknowledged as a key public information source in recent crises caused by Zika, H1N1, swine flu, and most recently, COVID-19. Methods: YouTube videos were collected from the YouTube Application Programming Interface (API) using the search terms COVID-19, coronavirus, COVID19, and corona. The search was conducted on April 4 and 5, 2020. The initial investigation found a total of 1084 videos. The second step involved identifying and verifying the videos for their relationship to COVID-19 information and excluding videos that did not relate to COVID-19 or were in a language other than English and Hindi. Results: An analysis of YouTube videos covering COVID-19, uploaded in early 2020, in English and Hindi. The sample comprised 349 videos (n = 334 English). Videos were characterized by contributor, duration, content, and reception (views/likes/dislikes/comments). The majority contained general information, with only 4.01% focusing on symptoms and 11.17% on treatment and outcomes. Further, the majority (n = 229) were short videos of under 10 min duration. Videos provided by government and health care professionals comprised 6.87% and 5.74% % of the sample, respectively. News channels uploaded 71.63% of videos. Conclusions: YouTube may provide a significant resource for disseminating of information on public health issues like outbreaks of viral infections and should be utilized by healthcare agencies for this purpose. However, there is currently no way to determine whether a video has been produced or verified by authorized healthcare professionals. This limitation needs to be addressed so that the vital distribution services offered by platforms like YouTube can be fully utilized for increasing public understanding of healthcare science, particularly during a crisis such as a pandemic. Journal of Medical Internet Research 2021 Background Social media platforms such as YouTube are hotbeds for the spread of misinformation about vaccines. Objective The aim of this study was to explore how individuals are exposed to antivaccine misinformation on YouTube based on whether they start their viewing from a keyword-based search or from antivaccine seed videos. Methods Four networks of videos based on YouTube recommendations were collected in November 2019. Two search networks were created from provaccine and antivaccine keywords to resemble goal-oriented browsing. Two seed networks were constructed from conspiracy and antivaccine expert seed videos to resemble direct navigation. Video contents and network structures were analyzed using the network exposure model. Results Viewers are more likely to encounter antivaccine videos through direct navigation starting from an antivaccine video than through goal-oriented browsing. In the two seed networks, provaccine videos, antivaccine videos, and videos containing health ... American Journal of ... 2010 2012 Human Vaccines & Immunotherapeutics discusses the health information on the web and social networking sites context situating them within the interactive health communication as a source of information increasingly popular.
