Of course, diets are nothing new. Americans have been searching for the Holy Grail of food combinations for centuries-and today there's an option for everyone. In some cases, you may need a specific diet because of a medical diagnosis. For example, men and women with celiac disease need a gluten free diet and some people with irritable bowel syndrome may find relief by following a low FODMAP plan. No matter the reason you are opting for a change in your diet, do you know the difference between paleo, clean eating, and gluten free? Let's break it down. Gluten Free: Gluten is a protein found in wheat, barley, rye and oats. Gluten gives the familiar stretchy texture to breads we love. Gluten can trigger a variety of allergic responses in patients who cannot tolerate it and cause a variety of health complications. Gluten free diets use alternate starches and flours that are made from grains like millet, flax, coconut, and a variety of others to create foods tolerated by the body. Fruits, vegetables, dairy, and meats are naturally gluten free so these foods are still part of the diet. Paleo:Paleo diets try to mimmic the foods that might have been eaten by early hunters and gatherers. Focusing on fresh vegetables, fruits and meats, paleo eating is a low-carb approach to eating. Processed foods, sugar, alcohol, grains, beans, and dairy are all no-no's for paleo. Clean Eating: Clean eaters opt for plenty of fresh fruits and vegetables, whole grains, limited amounts of dairy and no added sugar or alcohol. Clean eating focuses on taking in a balanced diet while avoiding all processed foods. White flour and white sugar are usually not part of a clean eating plan. Whatever your reason for considering a new diet plan, make sure to talk to your doctor or a dietician before beginning-especially if you have a preexisting medical condition. If your doctor says it's okay, then give one of these plans "}
