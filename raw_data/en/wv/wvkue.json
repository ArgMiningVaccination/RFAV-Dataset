Egyptians, Mayans and Sumerians all utilised the metaphysical power of the earth's stones to align their energy, cleanse the spirit and improve their physical health. The healing power of stones and minerals is once again finding popularity as health and wellness, holistic practices and non-pharmaceutical remedies are taking the wheel in the world of medicine and well-being. Having been largely dismissed, or forgotten, within modern culture, [crystal healing](https://naturalhealthcourses.com/courses/crystal-healing/) techniques are not exactly a common practice in today's society but are becoming more and more popular due to the rediscovery of this sacred, ancient science. Crystals are extremely useful in modern technology, their energy being used in the workings of quartz timepieces and electrical components within smart phones and computers. They are also used within medication - minerals contained within crystals are ground down and added to pharmaceutical drugs. So how exactly can a crystal, essentially a piece of rock, heal a human on so many levels (physically, mentally, emotionally and energetically)? Basically, everything on this earth is made up of energy, even inanimate objects are fundamentally vibrations of energy, just as are we (our cells) essentially made up of the same energy as a crystal. Just as a magnet uses its force to repel or attract other metals, a crystal can be placed close to other sources of energy and transform, vibrate, move and shift that energy in accordance with its own energetic structure. So certain crystals have different vibrations and can be utilised to alter the vibrations in us. The right stone has to be selected for the right situation and person, then the healing opportunities are endless. Our energy and overall health all comes down to balance. We need to create an equilibrium within us in order to be able to heal ourselves and live a healthy life. The vibrations from a crystal emit tiny electrical impulses which activate the human body's neurological system in a subtle manner. Crystal Healing is the art of laying on stones (crystals and gems) in coordination with the body's energy field, energy centres and energy pathways. These aspects of the body's energy field are also known as the aura, the chakras and the meridians. Correct placement of crystals on the body will promote emotional and mental harmony. It is in this state that the body experiences the perfect conditions in which to heal naturally. The chosen crystals and stones have the ability to remove unwanted negative energy, provide needed healing energy and balance things where our energy is off kilter in order to achieve a harmonious state. As well as Crystal Healing, there are different ways to utilise the healing powers of the stones; many people choose to select the correct crystal and wear it as jewellery or simply carry it on their person, or sleep near them so that throughout the night the energy is passed through you. Others meditate with their crystals or make crystal healing grids, another ancient healing technique designed to transmute energy. Types of crystals and their uses White/Clear Clearing Examples: Quartz, Moonstone, Selenite Uses: White and clear healing crystals are very absorbent. They are perfect for cleansing any type of energy. Many people use clear quartz in their meditation practices because it clears and calms the mind. Brown Allowing Examples: Tiger's Eye, Petrified Wood, Halite Uses: Brown healing crystals and stones are grounding. When you think of brown crystals, think of a dirt path in the dark woods. This path shows you the way and protects you on your journey. That's what brown stones do\u2014guide, protect and clear the way. Used for making room in life for something like a new job, or relationship. Red Energising Examples: Ruby, Garnet, Jasper Uses: Red healing crystals have a lot of energy. You can remind yourself of this by thinking of your reaction to a red stop sign, a red traffic light or a red warning signal. Red invokes sudden surges of energy, useful if you need a quick pick me up. Orange Releasing Examples: Copper, Sunstone, Aragonite Uses: Similarly to when you walk out into the sunshine and immediately feel better, orange healing stones relieve you of negative energy. Orange is simultaneously a soothing and energising colour. Use them when you're feeling low or lethargic. Yellow Aligning Examples: Amber, Sulphur, Mookaite Uses: Yellow gemstones are great for reorganising energy patterns. These healing crystals are perfect for times when you're trying to instil a new habit, or break an unhealthy one. Yellow stones are efficient, they don't just cleanse energy, they reorganise it. Green Balancing Examples: Jade, Emerald, Malachite Uses: Green gemstones are often used for physical healing because of their balancing properties. Often, our illnesses are a matter of too much of something. For example, digestive issues often stem from too much acid or too much unhealthy bacteria. While we need these things to survive, too much of them makes us sick. Green healing stones don't get rid of negative energy; instead, they tip the scales in the right direction, redirecting our energy flows and balancing them out. Blue Communicating Examples: Sapphire, Sodalite, Angelite Uses: Just like the blue throat chakra, blue healing crystals are all about openness and communication. If you're having trouble finding your truth, or you want the truth to be revealed about something, work with blue crystals for healing. Indigo Calming Examples: Kyanite, Azurite, Lapis Lazuli Uses: Sometimes, life gets really chaotic and you just want to relax and take it easy. Next time you want to treat yourself to a calming spa experience, use the soothing power of dark blue/indigo healing gemstones to mellow out anxious, fragile energy. Violet Uplifting Examples: Amethyst, Lolite, Sugilite Uses: Violet is one of the most powerful colours, it vibrates at a very high frequency. It is at the top of our colour spectrum, combining both the warm and cool ends of all the colours we can see. In this way, anything violet connects you to higher plane. Violet healing crystals are no exception, and they are perfect it you need to be uplifted or want to induce a spiritual experience. Black Protecting Examples: Tourmaline, Apache Tears, Obsidian Uses: Black healing crystals deflect everything. They are strong and resilient, so they make perfect protecting crystals. Use black stones to drive negative energies away from you. Pink Loving Examples: [Rose Quartz](https://www.consciouslifestylemag.com/rose-quartz-meaning-properties/), Morganite, Rhodonite Uses: Pink is a combination of passionate red and clarifying white. Pink crystals vibrate a compassionate, loving energy, so use them for anything that needs a little bit of sweetness. They're great for deflecting anger, drawing in romance or just helping you feel the love. At every moment we have the ability to choose our thoughts and as we continue our journey, each day presents us with new challenges and wonderful beginnings. Healing crystals remind us to quiet the chatter of the mind and reconnect to the universally healing vibrations of the earth. It takes a conscious effort to open your mind to the power of crystal healing, but once you begin, the journey can be studded with incredibly powerful energy that will potentially rock your world!
