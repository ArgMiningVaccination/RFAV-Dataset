What comes to mind when you think of your skin care routine? 1.) It's the most important part of my day. 2.) I do the basics but not much else. 3.) What skin care routine? Whether you have a drawer full of natural and [organic skin care products](https://mindfulmomma.com/certified-organic-skin-care-trends-from-the-natural-products-expo/) like me or you just stick to a few tried and true favorites, a face scrub is a good thing to have in your arsenal. Why Exfoliate Your Face? The main benefit of a face scrub is to exfoliate your skin, which means removing dry or dead skin cells. But wait - exfoliation does much more than that! Using a facial scrub will also help with: - increased blood circulation - removing toxins from the skin - growth of new skin cells - minimizing pores - reduced breakouts - absorption of nourishing ingredients Bottom line - a face scrub can lead to smoother, brighter looking skin (which helps with anti-aging goals). So let's get exfoliating! Homemade Face Scrub Powder (There are some affiliate links in this post. If you make a purchase through a link, I may receive a small commission. Thank you for supporting Mindful Momma if you do!) When I set about creating this face scrub, I had two goals in mind. First, to make a scrub that can be customized to any skin type or skin condition. To do that, I needed the basic ingredients to be simple, soothing and non-irritating. My second goal was to make a scrub that doesn't have to be refrigerated or used up within a week like most homemade beauty products without preservatives. To accomplish that, I went with a scrub powder. The powder is mixed with wet ingredients only when you are about to use it. Here are the ingredients in the face scrub powder: Rolled Oats - known for soothing itchy, dry skin Almonds or Almond Meal - contains nourishing oils to help soften skin Lavender Buds - naturally soothing to skin (you can [buy lavender buds online](https://www.amazon.com/Organic-Lavender-Flowers-Extra-Grade/dp/B01BTNMGXU/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&qid=1513180934&sr=8-4&keywords=lavender+buds&th=1&linkCode=sl1&tag=mindmomm099-20&linkId=45dcac4d7e60d213803119d9454c09b5) if you can't find them at a local store) Keep reading to find out how to make the basic scrub powder and to learn about the mix-in options to make the best homemade face scrub for every skin type! Related: [Homemade Lavender Calendula Balm](https://mindfulmomma.com/homemade-lavender-calendula-skin-balm/) Customizable Homemade Face Scrub Recipe Have I told you how simple this scrub is to make? Super duper simple! You will need either a blender, a food processor or a repurposed coffee grinder. A [Vitamix blender](https://mindfulmomma.com/Vitamix) rocks for this job, but you don't necessarily need anything that fancy. Place 1/4 cup rolled oats, 1/4 cup almonds and 1 tablespoon lavender buds in the blender and PULVERIZE! You want the powder to be very fine since it is used on your face. If you use almond meal in place of whole almonds, you can blend the oats and lavender first and then mix in the almond meal later. At this point, feel free to add in 8 drops of [lavender essential oil](https://www.amazon.com/NOW-Foods-Essential-Oils-Lavender/dp/B00CJD72EI/ref=as_li_ss_tl?s=aps&ie=UTF8&qid=1513181094&sr=1-2-catcorr&keywords=now+lavender+essential+oil&th=1&linkCode=sl1&tag=mindmomm099-20&linkId=c393198d48b79ddfcd6279082cd8f877) and mix well. This will give the scrub an extra burst of calming lavender that smells fantastic! When you are ready to use the scrub, mix it with the liquid that works best for your skin type or skin condition. For one application I recommend up to 1 tablespoon of scrub powder and a little less than that amount of wet ingredients. The \"recipe\" is not set in stone - you'll figure out the consistency that works best for you. Customizable scrub mix-ins: Oily skin - water Dry skin - oil (I prefer a lightweight oil like [apricot kernal](https://www.amazon.com/NOW-Apricot-Kernel-Oil-16-Ounce/dp/B00028MLG6/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&qid=1513181305&sr=8-1&keywords=now+foods+apricot+kernal+oil&th=1&linkCode=sl1&tag=mindmomm099-20&linkId=ee32159ba4fa53906afc08d41c62e46c), [grapeseed](https://www.amazon.com/NOW-Grape-Seed-Oil-16-Ounce/dp/B000RZPVV6/ref=as_li_ss_tl?s=hpc&ie=UTF8&qid=1513181419&sr=1-4&keywords=now+foods+grapeseed+oil&linkCode=sl1&tag=mindmomm099-20&linkId=e7b54f0b8e6c06e38807bbed5376fedd) or [sweet almond](https://www.amazon.com/Aura-Cacia-Organics-Sweet-Almond/dp/B000F6UJ32/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&qid=1513181580&sr=8-5&keywords=aura+cacia+sweet+almond+oil&linkCode=sl1&tag=mindmomm099-20&linkId=e94ddc13f693f7a40cbe64a3af0161a7)) Dull skin - plain yogurt Acne - honey Other possible scrub mix-ins include aloe vera gel, floral hydrosol, herbal tea or apple cider vinegar. Experiment and see what works best for you! My dry skin loves the oil version - especially in the winter! When I make the scrub with yogurt, I leave it on my skin for about 5 minutes as a face mask to let the lactic acid do its magic. Lactic acid helps break down dead skin cells, leaving skin brighter looking. Once the facial scrub has been rinsed off, follow with a spritz of toner and an [organic moisturizer](https://mindfulmomma.com/organic-moisturizers/) or [facial oil](https://mindfulmomma.com/facial-oil-serum/) to seal in the moisture. One final bonus about this homemade facial scrub powder is that it makes a fantastic gift!
