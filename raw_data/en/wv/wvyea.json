WHY SOURCE HEALING? ESTABLISHED We have had over 20 years of relationships built on trust, confidentiality, and respect. Our word of mouth holistic health practice has become a fixture for people to send their family, friends, and co-workers. THOROUGH, ONE-ON-ONE TREATMENTS Typical acupuncture clinics see up to 3-6 patients in an hour. At Source Healing, our acupuncturists dedicate the entire time to you, and only see 1-1.5 people an hour. This makes for a deeply personalized and thorough experience, and allows for our practitioners to really get to know you as an individual. MIND & BODY CONNECTION In Chinese medicine, physical markers in the body can be signs of emotional disharmonies and vice versa. In our acupuncture treatments, our acupuncturists will check in with your stress and anxiety levels, as well as your emotions in order to assess the balance between your mind and body. This can be found as deeply therapeutic, as Source Healing is known as a safe space for open communication and approaching acupuncture from a more emotional and even spiritual perspective. COLLABORATIVE GROUP PRACTICE We welcome you to see each of our practitioners here, as we work as a group practice. To ensure your sessions are aligned with your treatment plan, all of our practitioners collaborate with one another on each patient case, which we call the \"Think Tank.\" We work together to find the best course of action and customize each individual session. As part of the Source Healing group practice, each of our team members infuse the treatments with intuitive grace, deep listening, and gentle, expert guidance. We are all here to support you! WISDOM, PASSION, AND CREDENTIALS We only hire exceptional practitioners who have years of clinical experience with patients. No newbies here! Our acupuncturists are licensed by the state of Illinois and National Board Certified by the NCCAOM, which certifies them for both acupuncture AND herbal medicine, and they have a Masters Degree in Oriental Medicine, which consists of 3,000+ hours of instructions and 1,000+ hours of clinical hands-on experience. Additionally, all of our practitioners including our bodyworkers are trained in Western sciences, and various forms of energy work that keeps the treatments individualized and inspired. Each of our practitioners have a passion for what we do, which gives us a propensity to geek over it on our free time! This leads to a deeper level of tuning-in during each treatment, as we are not just going to go through the motions. We are here to help figure out your individual body and symptoms with you. STRONG RELATIONSHIPS Our relationship with you is very important to us. When you become our patient, we become partners in your well-being and encourage open communication! Just know that each and every one of us here genuinely care to work towards those goals with you. We want to support you in every way, and can also refer you to other trusted specialists and practitioners to support your healing outside of coming to Source Healing. \"If I ever need an emotional, spiritual, or physical tune up this is the first place I come. As I walk through the doors at Source Healing, I'm immediately enveloped in warmth, light, and unconditional welcoming. The treatments and staff match the ambience! I've seen the evolution of Source from the very beginning, and there is no other place I recommend as frequently and wholeheartedly.\" - Tiffany R. bottom of page "}
