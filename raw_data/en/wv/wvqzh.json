Too often, we bring products into our homes that have ingredients made from synthetic chemicals that do more harm than good. Foster a healthy home with toxin-free and eco-friendly therapeutic essential oils. These natural plant chemical compounds are safe for the whole family and can relieve stress, improve the immune system, and energize the mind. Take a few moments to learn about the benefits of aromatherapy. What is Aromatherapy? Aromatherapy is a holistic healing practice that uses natural plant extracts. Also known as essential oil therapy, it involves the inhalation or application of aromatic essential oils. It's been practiced for thousands of years in medical and spiritual applications because it's known to harmonize, balance, and heal the body, mind, and spirit. Whether you want to invite tranquility into your home or whether you want to treat a specific condition (such as insomnia, depression, or inflammation), your household will be uplifted by the therapeutic power of essential oils. Aromatherapy Applications Before we jump into the different types of essential oils, let's explore the ways you can enjoy aromatherapy - whether through inhalation or absorption of aromatherapeutic products through your skin. Inhalation One way to experience the effects of aromatherapy is by inhaling the scents from candles, room sprays, or diffusers. Breathing in these scents stimulate the olfactory nerves and send signals to the limbic system in the brain. This part of the brain controls emotional responses, stress, memory, breathing, and hormones. By a simple act of breathing in natural extracts, you'll be on your way to healing your mind and body. Topical Applications Another option for aromatherapy is topically applying essential oil products to your skin. As your body absorbs the oils, your nose will also inhale the aromas. Our favorite way to absorb essential oils topically is through a massage or a bath. A little self-love, especially during this pandemic, does wonders for your mental health. It has so many benefits - from reducing anxiety to relieving tension. Self-care should not be treated as a luxury; it should be a priority. All you need is a few minutes out of your day, essential oil products (such as [bath salts](https://thetherapistessentials.com/bath-salts/) or [candles](https://thetherapistessentials.com/therapy-candles/)), and a quiet place. Massaging products with essential oils into your skin can soothe sore muscles, relax your mind, lower your heart rate, and alleviate stress. Aromatherapy massages can also help with several specific conditions, such as anxiety, depression, insomnia, and dementia. Bring peace to your mind and uplift your spirit with a self-massage in the comfort of your home. Another great aromatherapeutic practice is bathing with bath salts. Bathing has several benefits, including releasing tension, reducing anger, preventing stress, and combating depression. If you bathe shortly before bed, your body temperature will rise leading to synchronized circadian rhythms, which enables you to have more restful sleep. While showers are great time-savers in the short term, occasional baths are best for caring for your mental health in the long term because baths are truly transformative. The Importance of Toxin-Free Products Over the years, the cases of heart disease, cancer, and Alzheimer's have increasingly risen due to [toxins](https://naturemed.org/how-toxins-cause-disease/) in everyday products. If you're making the decision to practice aromatherapy, check the ingredients list on the products you're using to ensure they're free of synthetic chemicals. When shopping, skip on products with [phthalates](https://toxicfreefuture.org/key-issues/chemicals-of-concern/phthalates/), parabens, sulfates, and [lead](https://toxicfreefuture.org/key-issues/chemicals-of-concern/lead/). By avoiding toxins, you'll be reducing your risk of diseases and helping preserve the planet. Benefits of Aromatherapy As we mentioned before there are several health benefits of aromatherapy. Whether you want to improve your sleep, increase your immunity, or ignite passion, there's a scent or combination of scents to restore your health. Discover the benefits of aromatherapy oils below. Aromatherapy for Mental Health Stress is an inescapable part of life. While we can't avoid it, we can manage it. This global pandemic has turned the world upside down, and it's more important than ever to treat ourselves to a little self-love. If you're feeling stressed, try aromatherapy. Spray essential oils in the air or light a candle and take several deep breaths. Your mind and body will release any stored-up tension and bring you to a place of peace. The best scent to manage and relieve stress is lavender. It lowers your heart rate and [calms the nervous system ](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22612017). In addition to helping you manage stress, aromatherapy can also relieve anxiousness and nervousness. Whether you have an anxiety disorder or whether you're about to head into a job interview, breathe in therapeutic essential oils. The oils will soothe and ground your mind. Some of the best aromatherapeutic scents for anxiousness include lavender and rose. You can't properly care for your family or friends if you neglect your own mental well-being.

COVID-19 has us all thinking a lot more about our loved ones' abilities to fight off diseases and viruses.

Aromatherapy for Pain We've all struggled with pain at some point in our lives, and we will likely experience it in the future. Good news is that aromatherapy aids in the management of [physical pain ](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5192342/), such as menstrual cramps, post-surgery pain, and sore muscles. The chemicals in the essential oils travel through your nose and reach your limbic system, which in turn allows your brain to perceive pain differently. Several essential oils can even reduce inflammation. Some of the best oils for pain include cinnamon, ginger, lavender, and thyme. Aromatherapy for Sleep Sleep is so important for positive attitudes, good moods, productivity, and achieving goals and aspirations. The sedative properties in certain oils calm the mind and enable you to drift into a peaceful sleep. Several studies (such as this [2005 study ](http://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/07420520500263276?journalCode=icbi20)) have been conducted showing that lavender works great as a natural sleep aid. Spray a therapeutic room spray or apply droplets of oil to the diffuser before bed. Or, massage products with essential oils on your wrists, feet, or arms in the morning and night to promote relaxation. Essential oils for sleep include lavender, chamomile, and ylang ylang. Aromatherapy for Energy and Focus Stimulate the brain and improve focus, memory, and mood with essential oils. For more energy throughout your day, instead of reaching for a caffeinated drink, try inhaling citrus essential oils. These oils have antioxidant terpenes, which naturally boost energy.
