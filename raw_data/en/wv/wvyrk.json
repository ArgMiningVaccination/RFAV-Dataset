It was beautifully staged. The well-known patter song of Ko-Ko, the Lord High Executioner of Japan, begged for a version that deals with anti-science [(original here](http://math.boisestate.edu/gas/mikado/webopera/mk105a.html)). The serious post will come later. Meanwhile here's some late night rhyming. Ko-Ko As some day it may happen that a victim must be found, I've got a little list \u2014 I've got a little list Of society offenders who might well be underground, And who never would be missed \u2014 who never would be missed! There's the pestilential bureaucrats who want to send you on a course \u2014 The HR folks who treat you not as human but as mere resource Skills specialists who think that education just means training And all ex-scientists who used to work, but now are only feigning They'd none of 'em be missed \u2014 they'd none of 'em be missed! Chorus. He's got 'em on the list \u2014 he's got 'em on the list; And they'll none of 'em be missed \u2014 they'll none of 'em be missed. Ko-Ko And that deluded nuisance, whom no one understands The homeopathist - I've got her on the list! All Reiki folks, pill hucksters and layers on of hands They'd none of 'em be missed \u2014 they'd none of 'em be missed. And herbalists and Princes who like to talk to trees Those phony nutritionists who'll treat you for large fees And that singular anomaly, the acupuncturist \u2014 I don't think they'd be missed \u2014 I'm sure they'd not be missed! Chorus. You may put 'em on the list \u2014 you may put 'em on the list; And they'll none of 'em be missed \u2014 they'll none of 'em be missed! Ko-Ko There's the vision statement writer, and others of that sort And the crystal therapist \u2014 I've got him on the list! And the people who think long words are a substitute for thought They never would be missed \u2014 they never would be missed! Then those whose knight starvation makes them crave the honours list So all below must suffer in case their chance is missed And those who think that science can be judged by its citations And so kill creativity by funding only applications But it really doesn't matter whom you put upon the list, For they'd none of 'em be missed \u2014 they'd none of 'em be missed! Chorus You may put 'em on the list \u2014 you may put 'em on the list; And they'll none of 'em be missed \u2014 they'll none of 'em be missed! Postscript I replaced two lines after my pedantic sister pointed out their imperfect rhyme and scansion. Personally I'm with Charles Babbage. Here is letter that Babbage is said to have written to Tennyson after reading \"The vision of sin\". In your otherwise beautiful poem there is a verse that reads: \"Every moment dies a man Every moment one is born\" It must be manifest that, were this true, the population of the world would be at a standstill. In truth the rate of birth is slightly in excess of that of death. I would suggest that in the next edition of your poem you have it read: \"Every moment dies a man Every moment 1 1/16 is born\" Strictly speaking this is not correct. The actual figure is a decimal so long that I cannot get it in the line, but I believe that 1 1/16 will be sufficiently accurate for poetry. I am etc, (The Mathematical Gazette, "}
