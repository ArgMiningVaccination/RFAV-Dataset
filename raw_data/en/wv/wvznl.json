In the European Union,while waste output is continually increasing, new regulations are imposing more stringent restrictions on theamount of waste permitted to go to landfill. At the sametime, many incinerators have been closed over the past fewyears because of stricter regulations on their atmosphericemissions. In Europe, all incinerators will soon have to comply with new standards set out in a recent EC draft directive. Fortunately, there are alternative solutions to turn around the waste crisis on a long-term basis. Primarily, this meansthe implementation of waste prevention strategies, and inconjunction with this, waste re-use and recycling. Despitethis option, there is an emerging trend for constructing, andplanning to construct, new incinerators in an attempt toprovide a \"quick fix\" solution to the waste crisis. Incineratorsare deemed as favourable in this respect because they areperceived as reducing waste to one tenth of its original volume, and therefore reduce the volume of waste going to landfill sites. Incinerators, however, are controversial in terms of their potential impacts on the environment and human health, as well as in terms of the economic considerations whichdo not favour this technology. They are known to emitnumerous toxic chemicals into the atmosphere and produceashes and other residues. One country, the Philippines, hastaken serious note of the many concerns about incinerationat a governmental level. Following strong public oppositionto incinerators, the Philippine Clean Air Act of 1999, bannedthe incineration of municipal, medical and hazardous waste.Waste reduction, re-use and recycling are being promotedwhile non-burn technologies are recommended for wastethat needs some form of treatment. Meanwhile, some governments in Europe are advocating the construction ofeven more incinerators. This report was undertaken to draw together scientific findings on incinerator or releases and their impacts onhuman health. A broad range of health effects have beenassociated with living near to incinerators as well as withworking at these installations. Such effects include cancer(among both children and adults) adverse impacts on therespiratory system, heart disease, immune system effects,increased allergies and congenital abnormalities. Somestudies, particularly those on cancer, relate to old ratherthan modern incinerators. However, modern incineratorsoperating in the last few years have also been associatedwith adverse health effects. Despite reductions of some chemicals in stack emissions, modern incinerators nevertheless still emit numerous toxicsubstances to the atmosphere as well as in other residuessuch as fly ash and bottom ash. Moreover, reductions of dioxins and other chemicals in stack gases commonly leadsto increased releases of these same chemicals in the otherincinerator residues. In most cases, health effects whichhave been associated with incinerators cannot be tieddown to a particular pollutant, Together with the limiteddata available, it is, therefore, impossible to predict health effects of incinerators including new or updatedinstallations. With such factors in mind, this report demonstrates that there is an urgent need for the completephase out of incineration and the implementation of soundwaste management policies based on waste prevention, re-use and recycling. INCINERATORS - WASTE GENERATORS It is a common misconception that things simply disappear when they are burned. In reality, matter cannotbe destroyed - it merely changes its form. This can beexemplified by looking at the fate of some substances inwastes which are burned in municipal solid waste (MSW)incinerators. These incinerators are typically fed mixedwaste streams that contain hazardous substances, such asheavy metals and chlorinated organic chemicals. Followingincineration, heavy metals present in the original solid wasteare emitted from the incinerator stack in stack gases and in association with tiny particles, and are also presentthroughout the remaining ashes and other residues.Incineration of chlorinated substances in waste, such aspolyvinyl chloride (PVC) plastic, leads to the formation ofnew chlorinated chemicals, such as highly toxic dioxins,which are released in stack gases, ashes and otherresidues. In short, incinerators do not solve the problems of toxic materials present in wastes. In fact they simply convert these toxic materials to other forms, some of whichmay be more toxic than the original materials. These newly created chemicals can then re-enter the environmentas contaminants in stack gases, residual ashes and other residues. All types of incinerators release pollutants to the atmosphere in stack gases, ashes and other residues. Amultitudinous array of chemicals is released, including innumerable chemicals that currently remain unidentified.The chemicals present in stack gases are often also presentin ashes and other residues. Such chemicals include (PCBs), polychlorinatednapthalenes, organic compounds (VOCs), and heavy metals including lead, cadmium and mercury. Many of these chemicals are known to be persistent (very resistant to degradation in theenvironment), bioaccumulative (build up in the tissues ofliving organisms) and toxic. These three properties makethem arguably the most problematic chemicals to whichnatural systems can be exposed. Some of the emittedINCINERATION AND HUMAN HEAL TH 7chemicals are carcinogenic (cancer-causing) and some are endocrine disruptors. Others such as sulphur dioxide (SO2) and nitrogen dioxide (NO2) as well as fine particulate matter, have been associated with adverse impacts on respiratory health. It is a popular misconception that the weight and volume of the original raw waste are reduced during incineration. It isoften quoted that the volume of waste is reduced by about90% during incineration. Even if only the residual ashes areconsidered, however, the actual figure is closer to 45%. Theweight of waste is supposedly reduced to about one-thirdduring incineration. However, this once again refers only toashes and ignores other incinerator emissions in the form ofgases, which result in an increased output in weight. Insum, if the mass of all the outputs from an incinerator,including the gaseous outputs, are added together, then theoutput will exceed the input. ENVIRONMENTAL AND HUMAN EXPOSURE TO INCINERATOR RELEASES The research carried out on environmental contamination and human exposure to pollutants released by incineratorsis limited and has focused mainly on dioxins and heavymetals. Research has demonstrated that both older and more modern incinerators can contribute to the contamination of local soil and vegetation with dioxins and heavy metals. Similarly, in several European countries,cow's milk from farms located in the vicinity of incineratorsin has been found to contain elevated levels of dioxins, insome cases above regulatory limits. Populations residing near to incinerators are potentially exposed to chemicals through inhalation of contaminatedair or by consumption of contaminated agricultural produce(e.g. vegetables, eggs, and milk) from the local area and bydermal contact with contaminated soil. Significantlyincreased levels of dioxins have been found in the tissues ofresidents near to incinerators in the UK, Spain and Japanmost likely as a result of such exposure. Two studies in theNetherlands and Germany however, did not find increasedlevels of dioxins in body tissues of residents living nearincinerators. At an incinerator in Finland, mercury wasincreased in hair of residents living in the vicinity, most likelydue to incinerator releases. Children living near a modernincinerator in Spain were found to have elevated levels ofurinary thioethers, a biomarker of toxic exposure. Elevatedlevels or more frequent occurrence of certain PCBsoccurred in the blood of children living near a hazardouswaste incinerator in Germany. Several studies have reported elevated levels of dioxins(total TEQ), and/or certain dioxin congeners, in the body tissues of individuals employed at both modern and olderincinerators. This is thought to be a consequence of exposure to contaminated ashes in the workplace. Similarly, some studies have reported increased levels of chlorinatedphenols, lead, mercury and arsenic in the body tissues ofincinerator workers. HEAL TH IMPACTS Experimental data confirm that incinerators release toxic substances and that humans are exposed as a consequence. Studies on workers at incinerator plants, and populations residing near to incinerators, have identified a wide range of associated health impacts (seetables below). These studies give rise to great concernsabout possible health impacts from incinerators eventhough the number of studies (particularly those that have been conducted to appropriately rigorous scientificstandards) is highly limited. These should be seen, however,as strongly indicative that incinerators are potentially verydamaging to human health. Elevated mutagens in urine Elevated levels of hydroxypyrene in urineHEALTH IMPACT Biomarkers of ExposureCOMMENTS Incinerator ashes and stack emissions are mutagenic(have the ability to damageDNA). Workers are thereforeexposed to mutagenic compounds. Elevated mutagens in urine indicateexposure to mutagenic compounds. (Study dates1990 & 1992). Hydroxypyrene is an indicatorof internal exposure to PAHs.The result suggests elevatedexposure to PAHs. (Studydate 1992). Increased quantity of thioethers in urine Thioethers in urine are an indicator of exposure to electrophilic compoundssuch as PAHs.

(Study date 1998). INCINERATOR RELEASES AND REGULATION Stack Gases As previously mentioned, numerous chemicals are emitted to the atmosphere from incinerators thrtough the stackgases. Important points regarding some of these chemicalemissions are given below. Dioxins Extensive research has demonstrated that dioxins can cause a diverse array of toxic effects. They have becomewidespread contaminants throughout the globe and arepresent in the body tissues of human beings across thewhole globe. Research suggests that, in industrialisedcountries, dioxins have now reached levels in tissues of thewomen which may cause subtle, adverse effects upon theimmune system, and nervous system of their babies. Incineration, particularly MSW incineration, was identified as a major source of dioxins during the 1980s and early1990s. It has been estimated as accounting for between40 and 80% of atmospheric dioxin emissions in variousindustrialised countries. The true figure may be evengreater because there are several methodological flaws in nearly all of the dioxin inventories that estimateatmospheric emissions from incineration. Considerable improvement in air pollution control technologies that have been installed in new or updatedincinerators during the 1990s is thought to have led to substantial reductions in the quantity of dioxins released to the atmosphere from incinerator stacks. However, recentestimates suggest that MSW incinerators are still a mainsource of dioxins in the environment. In the UK, it was estimated that MSW incinerators were responsible for 30-56% of dioxin emissions while in Denmark a recentmass balance study identified MSW incineration as theINCINERATION AND HUMAN HEAL TH 11dominant source of dioxins to atmosphere and a highly significant contributor (via ash residues) to landfill.Moreover, reduction of dioxins emitted in stack gases hasmost likely resulted in a corresponding increase in dioxinsemitted as contaminants of ash residues. While measurements taken from some new or modernised incinerators have shown that they comply with limits set by the new EC directive, others have not. Those not fulfillingthe EC regulatory limit include incinerators that have recently been tested in Spain, Poland, Sweden, andBelgium. In Belgium, testing was carried out on an incinerator using the routine technique of taking \"pointmeasurements\" which involves monitoring dioxin levels over a period of several hours. However, when testing wascarried out by \"continual monitoring\", over a 2 week period,the results were substantially different. The point measurement technique underestimated dioxin emissionsby a factor of 30 to 50. It is therefore of great concern thatvery few incinerators are tested using continual monitoringor tested under their normal operating conditions.Moreover, the new EC regulations do not stipulate thatmeasurements should be taken using this technique, socurrent routine monitoring of incinerator stack gases, usingpoint measurements, could be grossly inaccurate andunderestimate dioxin emissions to air. Other Organic Compounds For regulatory purposes, the EC has proposed a limit for total organic carbon emissions to atmosphere to regulate allthe organic chemicals emitted. This regulation, however,fails to take into account the toxicity/health impacts ofknown organic chemicals that are emitted from incineratorstacks. Similarly it totally ignores unknown chemicals ofunknown toxicity and the potential health effects they couldcause. Heavy Metals Heavy metals, including lead and cadmium, are emitted in stack gases from incinerators. Many heavy metals arepersistent and exert a wide range of adverse impacts onhealth. With the exception of mercury, the levels of heavy metals released in stack gases from incinerators have decreasedconsiderably over the past decade due to improvement inair pollution abatement technologies. Nevertheless, thequantities in which they are still emitted from modern incinerators potentially add to current background levels in the environment and in humans. As is the case withdioxin emissions to the atmosphere, the reduction of levels of heavy metals emitted in stack gases causes a corresponding increase in levels in the ashes, which will,ultimately, result in contamination of the environment when these are disposed of. Particulate Matter Incinerators of all types emit particulate matter into the atmosphere. The majority of this particulate matter is ultrafine in size. Current air pollution control devices onincinerators only prevent 5 to 30% of the \"respirable\" (<2.5\u00b5m) sized particles from entering the atmosphere, and cando very little to prevent ultrafine (<0.1 \u00b5m) particulates fromescaping. It is these respirable particles, and especially theultrafine particles, which can reach the deepest regions ofthe lungs, and which are thought to be responsible forcausing adverse impacts on human health. Incineratorstherefore contribute to the type of particulate air pollutionthat is the most dangerous for human health. In addition,recent evidence suggests that particles containing heavymetals, such as those emitted from incinerators are especially of concern with regard to health. Incinerators are, therefore, likely to produce particulate air pollutionwhich is even more toxic than, for example, that emittedfrom a coal-fired power station. The new EC Draft Directive does not set any limits for the release of fine particulate matter. Given the scale of thehealth impacts resulting from such particulate air pollution,this can be considered as an outstanding neglect of factorsrelevant to human health, and which requires rigid controland regulation. Ashes Fly ashes from air filtration equipment on incinerators and the bottom ashes that remain after incineration containnumerous hazardous chemicals, such as dioxins and heavymetals. Despite the potential toxicity of ashes, there are noEC limits for levels of persistent organic chemicals andheavy metals in ashes. Because of their contamination, disposal of incinerator ashes presents significant environmental problems. Themajority of ash is landfilled. This can result in contaminationof sub-soils and groundwater. In some cases, the contamination of groundwater by compounds that haveleached from the waste, in particular, heavy metals like leadand cadmium from fly ash has been documented. In anattempt to reduce leaching, fly ash is sometimes stabilisedin cement before disposal. Although this method reducesthe immediate leaching of heavy metals and other toxicchemicals, weathering and erosion over time will ultimatelycause their release back to the environment There has been a recent tendency in some European countries to use bottom ashes and/or fly ashes for construction purposes, a practice that reduces the financialcosts of \"secure\" ash disposal. Ash has been used in roadand path construction. Again, however, the future releasesof persistent toxic substances due to erosion over timecould result in the release of substances back to the INCINERATION AND HUMAN HEAL TH12environment and, therefore, potentially to human exposure. This has recently been exemplified in Newcastle, UK wherefly ash and bottom ash from a presently operating, modernincinerator, were used for path making and also spread overallotments as fertiliser between 1994 and 1999. Recentanalysis of ash from the allotments found that it is contaminated with extremely high levels of heavy metalsand dioxins. Clearly, the use of ashes from incinerators represents a potential threat to human health, but this practice is not being discouraged either by the EC or at anational level by the regulatory regimes proposes or currently in place. The Way Forward A limited amount of epidemiological research has been directed at investigating the health impacts of incinerators.Despite this, scientific studies reveal that MSW and otherincinerators have been associated with detrimental impactson health. The new EC draft directive on incinerators is not formulated to take human health impacts into account in relation to the regulation and control of these facilities. Rather, the regulatory limits that are set for the permissible release of substances are based on what is considered to be technically achievable. In any case, the draft EC directive on incinerators, not yet in force, can be regarded as already outdated. Many European countries have alreadycommitted themselves at the OSPAR Convention to phaseout all releases of hazardous substances to the environmentby 2020. In this context no emissions of hazardous chemicals would be allowable in stack gases or ashes. Thisis likely to prove impossible for incineration technology toever achieve. In addition, at the Fifth Intergovernmental Negotiating Committee Meeting (INC5) on the Elimination of PersistentOrganic Pollutants (POPs), held in December 2000, aworld-wide agreement was reached to reduce total dioxinreleases, with the ultimate aim of their elimination.Incineration is listed as one of the main industrial sourcecategories for dioxins, and requires the use of BAT (Bestavailable Techniques) for new installations and substantiallymodified existing facilities. It was also agreed to promotethe development and, where deemed appropriate, requirethe use of substitute or modified materials, products andprocesses to prevent the formation and release of dioxins.In this context, incineration is acknowledged as a significantsource of dioxins that, in the longer term, should bereplaced by alternatives. To comply with the provisions of the OSPAR agreement and of the emerging POPs Convention implies a radical rethinkof industrial and manufacturing processes. Instead ofwaste-generating \"dirty\" technologies, which rely uponincineration and other environmentally dubious waste disposal techniques, OSPAR implies the need to developand use \"clean-production\" technologies which eliminatetoxic waste. The adoption of \"zero-waste\" as a central tenet of environmental regulation also implies that thePrecautionary Principle of environmental protection willoccupy an equally key position in the development of policy and regulatory frameworks. The precautionary principle requires that the burden of proof should not belaid upon the protectors of the environment to demonstrateconclusive harm, but rather on the prospective polluter todemonstrate no likelihood of harm. On this premise of precautionary regulation it can be argued that there isalready sufficient evidence of environmental contaminationand adverse human health impacts to call for a completephase out of incineration. In the case of waste management, adoption of a zero releases strategy and the reduction of health impacts from waste management means a move towards an environmental management paradigm based upon thethree axioms of reduce, re-use and recycle in relation to the generation of both municipal and industrial wastes. GREENPEACE DEMANDS A drive towards waste prevention, re-use and recycling, and therefore also towards lessening the adverse health impactsfrom waste management, should include the followingmeasures: The phase out of all forms of industrial incineration by 2020, including MSW incineration. This is in line with the OSPAR Convention for the phase out of emissions of all hazardous substances by 2020. Financial and legal mechanisms to increase re-use of packaging (e.g. bottles, containers) and products (e.g. computer housings, electronic components). Financial mechanisms (such as the landfill tax) used directly to set up the necessary infrastructure for effective recycling. Stimulating markets for recycled materials by legal requirements for packaging and products, where appropriate, to contain specified amounts of recycled materials. Materials that cannot be safely recycled or composted at the end of their useful life (for example PVC plastic) must be phased out and replaced with more sustainable materials. INCINERATION AND HUMAN HEAL TH 13 In the short term, materials and products that add to the generation of hazardous substances in incinerators mustbe prevented from entering the the waste stream at the cost of the producer. Such products would include electronic equipment, metals and products containing metals such as batteries and florescent lighting and PVCplastics (vinyl flooring, PVC electrical cabling, PVC packaging, PVC- uwindow frames etc) and other products containing hazardous substances. and more generally: Further the development of clean production technologies which are more efficient in terms of material and energy usage, produce cleaner products with less waste and which, ultimately can be designed to operate in a \"closed loop\" configuration in order to fulfil the needs of society in a more equitable and sustainable manner; Fully implement the Precautionary Principle, such that, in the future, problems are avoided before they occur. The continuation and further development of scientific research has a fundamental role to play in identification of potential problems and solutions. Nonetheless, we must be ready to take effective precautionary action to prevent environmental contamination and degradation inthe face of the considerable and often irreducible uncertainties associated with determination of health and other environmental impacts from incineration.INCINERATION AND HUMAN HEAL TH141. INTRODUCTION TO HEALTH EFFECTS OFINCINERATORSINCINERATION AND HUMAN HEAL TH 15The impact of waste incinerators on health and their releases of hazardous combustion products, such as dioxinsand PAHs are of great public concern (Ardevol et al. 1999). Research has identified numerous toxic compounds, whichare emitted in stack gases and in ashes, as well as manyunidentified substances of unknown toxicity (see section 5).Individuals who are exposed to the hazardous substancesresulting from incineration, and whose health can, therefore,be potentially affected by such exposure, include workersconnected with incinerator facilities and populations livingwithin their local vicinity. Studies on exposure and healthimpacts of incinerators have focused entirely on these twogroups of individuals. Importantly, a recent publication by the National Research Council (NRC 2000), an arm of the National Academy of Sciences that was established to advise the U.S. government, concluded that it was not only the healthof workers and local populations that could be affected byincinerators. The NRC reported that populations living more distantly from incinerators are also likely to beexposed to some incinerator pollutants. For example, \"Persistent air pollutants, such as dioxins, furans and mercury, can be dispersed over large regions - wellbeyond the local areas and even the countries from whichthe sources first emanate.... Food contaminated near anincineration facility might be consumed by people close tothe facility or far away from it. Thus, local deposition onfood might result in some exposure of populations at greatdistances, due to transport of food to markers. However,distant populations are likely to be more exposed throughlong-range transport of pollutants and low-level, widespread deposition on food crops at locations remote from a source incineration facility.\" and, \"The potential effects of metals and other pollutants that are very persistent in the environment may extend wellbeyond the area close to the incinerator. Persistent pollutants can be carried long distances from their emission sources, go through various chemical and physical transformations, and pass numerous timesthrough soil, water, or food. Dioxins, furans, and mercuryare examples of persistent pollutants for which incineratorshave contributed a substantial portion of the total nationalemissions. Whereas one incinerator might contribute onlya small fraction of the total environmental concentrationsof these chemicals, the sum of the emissions of all theincineration facilities in a region can be considerable. The primary pathway of exposure to dioxins is consumption of contaminated food, which can expose a very broad population. In such a case, the incrementalburden from all incinerators deserves serious consideration beyond a local level.\" In the present report, published research on human exposure to pollutants from incinerators and health impactstudies of workers and local populations is discussed. Abroad range of health impacts has been documented inthese two groups, including adverse effects on children living in local populations near to incinerators. However,whether the observed associations with pollutants fromincinerators are causal is often difficult to confirm. Types of Research Study The impacts of incinerators on human health have been assessed primarily using three types of study. These arehuman exposure studies, epidemiological studies and finally, risk assessment studies. Exposure studies and epidemiological studies provide the most compelling evidence about the health impacts of incineration since they involve generating scientific data directly from the individuals under investigation. On the other hand, riskassessments are theoretical estimations of what healtheffects may occur based on mathematical calculation. Exposure Studies Exposure to compounds emitted from incinerators may occur, for example, by inhalation of contaminated air, or byconsumption of local agricultural produce or soil that hasbeen contaminated by deposition of airborne pollutants. Inaddition, workers at incinerator plants may also be exposedto contaminated ashes. To assess possible health impacts resulting from exposure to incinerator releases, reliable methods of assessing exposure are required. One method to assess potentialexposure is to monitor levels of contaminants in air fromincinerators, and in soils, vegetation and agricultural produce (e.g. see section 4). However, such investigationsdo not permit the \"internal exposure\" in humans to beassessed directly (Ardevol et al. 1999). Evaluation of internal exposure requires the quantification of compounds in thehuman body. In recent years, with technological advances,it has become possible to monitor the level of certain toxiccompounds from incinerators in the body tissues ofhumans. This involves the determination of contaminantconcentrations in biological samples, for instance, in blood,urine, hair or breast milk. Exposure studies analyse biological samples for: 1) chemical pollutants that are released from an incinerator,or, 2) metabolites (breakdown products) of these chemicals, or, 3) biomarkers of exposure, (which show biological effects of a toxic exposure). The results of theanalyses are compared with a control group of individualsconsidered to be unexposed. INCINERATION AND HUMAN HEAL TH16A number of studies have been conducted to assess exposure of incinerator workers (see section 2.1) and populations living near to incinerators (see section 3.1)using the analyses described above. Epidemiological Studies Epidemiological studies attempt to establish the incidence or prevalence of health effects that may be related to theintake of pollutants released from an incinerator. Informationpertinent to the potentially contaminated people is used, forexample, birth and death certificates, disease registries,physicians' reports, self-reported symptoms and illnesses.This is compared with similar information from potentiallyuncontaminated or less contaminated people. Some of themajor challenges to establishing a cause-and-effect relationship through epidemiological studies are (NRC 2000): Identifying suitably exposed populations that are large enough to establish a useful degree of statistical significance. Identifying the many factors that modify the effect (e.g., age, sex, etc.) and/or potentially confounding factors (e.g., smoking, diet, etc.) Identifying biases (including reporting biases) in data collection. Measuring the frequency of occurrence and concentrations of specific pollutants within the affected population and a potentially unaffected control group. Measuring effects that are small, occur infrequently, take many years to appear, and/or occur not in the exposed individuals but in their offspring during infancy, childhood or adulthood. Epidemiological studies have investigated a variety of health outcomes from exposure to incinerator releases in bothworkers and in populations living close to incinerators. Inparticular, cancer and respiratory effects have beenanalysed. Such human epidemiological studies are howeverlimited in number given the widespread concern aboutpotential health effects of incinerators. The rarity of thesestudies is possibly due to their expense and difficulty ofperformance. These studies are generally more valid thanother health studies insofar as exposure to all pollutantsemitted from incinerators are explicitly or implicitly account-ed for, thus mirroring the \"real\" situation (Rowat 1999)although their power is determined by their design. Risk Assessment Risk assessment attempts to estimate exposure to a particular chemical from the releases in question and ultimately calculates the probability of health effects fromthe estimated exposure. Risk assessment is a step by stepprocess which involves the use of mathematical equationsto estimate pollutant releases, their transport and theirtransformation in the environment, together with human exposure and finally the likelihood of suffering health effectsfrom this exposure. The use of risk assessment is largely forregulatory decision making. The process of risk assessment itself is, however, fraught with uncertainties, is necessarily over-simplistic ofenvironmental processes and warrants being viewed withdeep scepticism on whether it can actually be protective ofhuman health (e.g. Johnston et al. 1996). A fundamental problem of risk assessment is that the estimation of thehealth consequences of pollution is still a poorly understoodscience. Even for dioxin (TCDD), one of the most intenselystudied chemicals, many unknowns remain and since riskassessment relies on toxicological data to estimate healtheffects, it is can only be as good as the data on which it isbased. Indeed for many chemicals there is a substantiallack of toxicological information. This could obviously leadto imprecision in results generated by risk assessments.Moreover, in the case of the developing foetus and infant,there is a huge uncertainty in the toxicological significanceof long-term low-dose exposure to pollutants. It is clearthough that the developing stages of life are the most vulnerable to toxic insult. Risk assessments however aregenerally based on estimation of risk in adults and ignorethe potential impacts on the foetus and developing young. In estimating the probability of health impacts, many uncertainties appear at every stage of the risk assessmentprocess. For instance, there is uncertainty in estimating the quantities of releases, in estimating the transport andtransformation of pollutants in the environment and, fromthis calculation, estimating human exposure. It is indeedextremely difficult, if not impossible, to determine the actualdoses involved in environmental exposures. In order toovercome uncertainties in estimations, risk assessors use\"conservative\" estimates and so assume that overestimatingrisks overcomes these problems and is therefore protectiveof public health. However, the notion of \"conservative\" is ill-defined and in practice raises significant questions concerning exactly how conservative a risk assessmentshould be and whether all uncertain parameters should be conservatively treated or just a selected few. In this wayit becomes apparent that risk assessment not only containsmany uncertainties, but it is also a subjective rather than a scientifically objective process. This again calls into question whether regulations derived from risk assessmentscan be truly protective of human health. With regard to incineration and risk assessment, the National Research Council (NRC 2000), noted that the procedures used to perform risk assessment \"vary widely, from a snap judgment to the use of complex analytic models,\" and described other related difficulties:INCINERATION AND HUMAN HEAL TH 17\"The committee's evaluation of waste incineration and public health was substantially impaired by the lack of available compilations of ambient concentrations of pollutants resulting from incinerator emissions. In addition, large variabilities and uncertainties associated with risk-assessment predictions often limit the ability todefine risks posed by incinerators.... Emission data needed to fully characterize environmental concentrations for health-effects assessments are not readily available for most incineration facilities. Such information is lacking especially for dioxins and furans, heavy metals (such as lead, mercury, and cadmium), and particulate matter.... Generally, data are not collected during startup, shutdowns, and upset conditions - when the greatest emissions are expectedto occur. Furthermore, such data are typically based on a few stack samples for each pollutant. Thus, the adequacy of such emissions data to characterize fully the contribution of incineration to ambient pollutant concentrations for health-effects assessments is uncertain.\" A further point on the estimation of releases with regard to incinerators is that data are usually based on test burns that are carried out under optimal conditions. It is likely that such data underestimate releases under operationalconditions (see further section 5. 1.1), (Webster and Connett 1990). Risk assessments on incinerators generally focus on only one or a few substances that are known to be emitted, inparticular dioxins and selected heavy metals. However, in reality, releases from incinerators consist of complex mixtures of hundreds of chemicals including manyunknown compounds with unknown toxicity. Risk assessment omits to take into account health impacts of many of the known chemicals and all the unknownchemicals (Johnston et al. 1996). In addition, in looking at just single chemicals, it does not address the issue of the combined toxicity of the chemical mixtures in stackemissions (Johnston et al. 1998). For instance, the combination of two or more chemicals together may cause an additive or even greater than additive (synergistic)effect or a less than additive (antagonistic) effect. A further problem in risk assessment is that it is very difficult to determine which are the most appropriate andsensitive endpoints for detecting the toxicity of chemicals.An adverse effect on the immune system or respiratory system may, for instance, be more sensitive and be instigated at lower chemical concentrations than anothersort of health impact. For health risk assessment on incinerators, toxicological endpoints can include both cancer and non-cancer effects on health. Whatever endpoint is chosen, it is thereby accepted as a key metriccapable of being used to protect human health in an holistic manner. It is questionable, however, whether thecorrect endpoints are ever used in risk assessment. In addition, as discussed above, the developing young are likely to be more sensitive to some adverse chemical effects than adults. In summary, there is a dauntingly wide spectrum of inadequacies and uncertainties inherent in the process ofrisk assessment, from the estimation of type and quantity of pollution, to estimates of exposure and health effects.Each of these problems alone can fatally compromise riskassessment procedures. It is particularly important thatthese limitations are recognised when risk assessment isapplied in the formulation, implementation or enforcementof regulations. Risk assessment should be viewed withdeep scepticism unless all the areas of uncertainty areexplicitly defined (Johnston et al. 1998). Risk assessments that have been performed for incinerators are briefly discussed in section 3.3.INCINERATION AND HUMAN HEAL TH182. OCCUPATIONAL HEALTH IMPACTSINCINERATION AND HUMAN HEAL TH 192.1 Exposure Municipal incinerator workers have considerable exposure to incinerator ash and this raises the possibility that theymight absorb significant quantities of dioxins, and othertoxic substances present in ash. The greatest potential forexposure to the toxic components of ash occurs during ash cleaning operations (Schecter et al. 1991). Respiratory personal protective equipment is designed to give workersprotection from pollutants although it is important to notethat dioxins and many other contaminants are alsoabsorbable through the skin. According to the NRC (2000): \"Incinerator operators and maintenance workers, and those involved in the collection, transport, and disposal offly ash and emission control equipment residues, have thepotential to be most exposed to toxic substances associated with incineration.\" Noting that \"incinerator workers have been exposed to high concentrations of dioxins and toxic metals, particularly lead, cadmium, and mercury,\" the NRC assigned its highest level of concern to incinerator workers, irrespective of the implementation of maximumachievable control technologies (NRC 2000). Studies on exposure of incineration workers are limited in number and in their focus. The majority have investigatedexposure to dioxins and a few heavy metals whilst twostudies investigated other organic compounds. Nearly allthe studies investigated MSW incinerators but not othertypes of incinerator. 2.1.1 Dioxins Research has indicated that incinerator workers can be exposed to elevated levels of dioxins in workplace air.Studies published on incinerator workers themselves duringthe 1990s also implied that workers have suffered fromexposure to dioxin levels in the workplace that were abovebackground levels. Specifically, some studies reported elevated levels of dioxins (total TEQ) in workers' blood.Other studies did not find an increase in total dioxins butdid find an increase in certain dioxin congeners. Overall,these studies demonstrated that workers at incineratorscould be subjected to increased exposure to dioxins. A study in the US at a refuse-derived fuel, coal co-fired incinerator showed that incinerator workers are exposed to higher than background levels of dioxins in air in theworkplace (Pilspanen et al. 1992). Levels of dioxins in workplace areas were higher than in other ambient air concentrations from the region. The source of these pollutants was thought to be associated with particulate matter emitted through combustion backpressure or leakage from the boiler, and subsequently carried by aircurrents through the plant. Commenting on this study,Marty (1993) notes that it demonstrated that worker exposure to dioxins is considerable in the incinerator occupation compared with exposure of the general population. The National Institute for Occupational Safetyand Health (NIOSH) investigated three MSW incinerators in New York in 1992. They determined that airborne concentrations of dioxins during a cleaning procedure (ofthe lower chamber) were high enough to exceed the protection capabilities of the protective respiration equipment worn by the workers during this operation(NIOSH 1995). The study concluded that cleaning operations at the incinerators poses a health hazard. Kitamura et al. (2000) demonstrated that the average dioxin concentrations in the blood of workers was 3.7 timeshigher than the levels measured in nearby residents at anincinerator in Japan. The incinerator operated between1988 until 1997 when it was closed due to high stackemissions of dioxins and contamination of local soil. Thestudy measured dioxin concentrations in the blood of 94workers. The level of dioxins in blood samples ranged from13.3 to 805.8 parts per trillion (ppt) TEQ, with a mean valueof 93.5 ppt TEQ (lipid basis). Workers who had cleaned theinside of incinerators had the highest dioxin levels. In addition, contact with fly ash was identified as an importantfactor for high dioxin levels in blood. Workers who had nodirect contact with fly ash had lower blood levels (average34.2 ppt TEQ). In comparison, the average concentration ofdioxins determined in blood from residents living within 2km of the incinerator was 25.3 ppt TEQ. Co-planar PCBswere also monitored in the study. Some workers showedhigh PCB levels (range 3.1 to 54.2 ppt TEQ) and the studynoted that environmental measurement of PCBs might benecessary. Health impacts observed in workers from thisstudy are discussed below in Section 2.2.2. A study at a municipal waste incinerator in Germany was undertaken in which blood samples were taken from 56male workers, and the level of dioxins was measured in apooled (combined) blood sample (Schecter et al. 1991). The sample was compared to a pooled blood sample takenfrom a control group of males who had no known exposureto toxic materials. Results showed that the incinerator workers had a 30% higher level of dioxins (total TEQ) inblood compared to the control group. Dibenzofurans wereparticularly elevated (103 ppt in workers versus 47 ppt incontrols). In addition, the congener profile (pattern of levelsof the different dioxin congeners) in the workers blood was similar to the congener profile of incinerator ash. Thisimplied, together with the elevated levels of dioxins inworkers blood, that workers had been exposed to dioxins INCINERATION AND HUMAN HEAL TH20in the workplace. These findings subsequently led to the implementation of more stringent worker protection methods at the plant (Schecter et al. 1994). A study in Japan on two workers who had been employed for over eight years, at what is now an obsolete MSWincinerator, found blood levels of dioxins were still elevatedseveral years after their employment ceased (Schecter et al. 1999). The concentrations of dioxins in the workers blood was extremely high (360 ppt TEQ and 278 ppt TEQ, lipidbasis). By comparison, the average Japanese blood level is24 ppt TEQ, making levels in the two men to be 15 and11.5 times higher than the general population.Dibenzofurans accounted for most of the TEQ. The incinerator had burned household waste including PVC andother plastics. It is of note that elevation of dibenzofuransrather than of dibenzodioxins has been reported more frequently for such combustion processes. One of theworkers wives also had elevated dioxins in her blood (98ppt TEQ), but the wife of the other worker did not have elevated levels (18 ppt TEQ). It was proposed that the highlevel in one of the women might have resulted from herwashing contaminated clothing brought home by her husband. In contrast to the above studies, research at some incinerators has not always found elevated levels of totalTEQ dioxins in workers blood, but has nevertheless foundelevations in certain dioxin congeners, in particular, hexa- and hepta-dibenzofurans. A study of 10 workers froma MSW incinerator in Germany (Papke et al. 1993) found elevated levels of these congeners together with total dioxins in some of the workers. Another study on four workers from a MSW incinerator in the Netherlandsreported elevated levels of these congeners as well as ofhepta- and octa-dibenzodioxins as compared to the bloodfat of five local residents (van den Hazel and Frankort 1996).The values reported show that the average concentration ofhepta-dibenzodioxins was about three times higher in the workers; octa-dibenzodioxins, 1.7 times higher; hexa-dibenzofuran, almost two times higher; and hepta-dibenzofuran, 1.9 times higher. A study on 31 workers from 3 chemical waste incinerators in Germany, by contrast, did not find elevated levels of dioxins in workers blood (Papke et al. 1994). Levels of dioxins in blood were within the normal range. However,two workers were identified who showed elevated levelsof hepta- and hexa-dibenzofurans as described in the studies above. 2.1.2 Other Organic Compounds A study was undertaken on workers at an incinerator in Germany regarded as having modern health and safetystandards (Wribitzky et al. 1995). This investigated 45 workers who were in contact with the incinerator and others who were not, namely 54 periphery workers and 23management workers. The biological exposure limits set inGermany were not exceeded for benzene, toluene orxylene, although levels of these substances were elevatedabove general population levels for some employees.Significantly higher toluene concentrations, however, weredetected in blood of incinerator workers relative to otheremployees. In addition, higher levels of chlorophenols werefound in incinerator workers compared to other employees,suggesting occupational exposure among these workers.The degree of elevation of both toluene and chlorophenolswere nevertheless small and were not considered by theauthors as relevant to occupational health. NRC (2000) reviewed a study by Angerer (1992) which investigated levels of various organic chemicals in the bloodand urine of 53 workers from a MSW incinerator inGermany compared to 431 control subjects. The studyreported elevated levels of hexachlorobenzene in plasmaand of chlorophenols in urine. Workers had significantlyhigher levels of 2,4-and 2,5-dichlorophenol, and 2,4,5-trichlorphenol, and of plasma hexachlorobenzene(HCB). These chemicals were analysed because they aredioxin precursors compounds. Of other chemicals detectedin urine, 4-monochlorophenol and tetrachlorophenol, werehigher in the control group and there were no significantdifferences between workers and the control group for levels of plasma PCBs, blood benzene and urinary 2,4,6-trichlorophenol and pentachlorophenol. The NRCreview commented that due to the lack of consistent findings between the worker and control groups, no conclusion could be drawn from this study on the exposureto combustion precursors of dioxins and hence no inferences could be drawn concerning exposure to dioxins.However, it is possible that workers suffered increasedexposure to PAHs based on evidence of a biomarker ofexposure (see section 2.1.4). 2.1.3 Heavy Metals Studies have been carried out in order to investigate whether workers may be exposed to elevated levels ofsome heavy metals in air in the workplace. Three studies on incinerator workers have suggested that workers hadexperienced increased exposure to certain heavy metals,but one study, by contrast, found little evidence ofincreased exposure. NRC (2000) describe a study performed by the National Institute for Occupational Safety in 1992 at three MSWincinerators in New York that investigated levels of heavymetals in the workplace (NIOSH 1995). The airborne concentrations of aluminium, arsenic, cadmium, lead and nickel during some periods of the clean-out of theelectrostatic precipitator were high enough to exceed theINCINERATION AND HUMAN HEAL TH 21protection capabilities of the air purifying respirators worn by the workers during these operations. This led to the conclusion that working during these clean-out operationsat incinerators poses a health hazard. In 1989, a study on incinerators in New York found that, in some cases, workers were exposed to high levels of lead in air. Following this report, a study was conducted on thelevels of lead in workers blood at three New York incinerators (Malkin et al. 1992). Results showed that the average lead level was statistically significantly increased in workers compared to a control group of workers (mean11.0 mg/dl versus 7 .4 mg/dl), although it did not exceed the maximum US limit that is deemed acceptable in theworkplace of 40 mg/dl. The study suggested that the presence of lead in incinerator ash is capable of increasinglead concentrations in workers blood. In contrast, a studyon a German incinerator with very modern health and safety standards did not find that lead was elevated inworkers blood (Wrbitzky et al. 1995). A study by Bresnitz et al. (1992) was conducted on exposure to heavy metals and health impacts amongst 86 MSW incinerator workers in the US. This revealed that these substances were generally not elevated in theworker's blood and urine. Only 8 of the 47 1 tests for heavy metal exposure showed levels of heavy metals thatwere elevated above the expected levels for an unexposedpopulation. These included zinc, mercury and lead.However, the elevated levels were not related to workersexposure categories and were not deemed to be clinically significant. A study on a hazardous waste incinerator in Finland assessed levels of mercury in 11 workers in 1984 and againin 1994 (Kurttio et al. 1998). Results showed that during the ten-year period, mercury levels, measured in hair, increasedin the workers from 0.62 to 0.98 mg/kg. However, mercurylevels were not high in workers in comparison to unexposed population levels worldwide (0.5 - 4.0 mg/kg inhair). A study of workers at an incinerator in Germany thathas notably high safety standards also did not find thatbackground levels of mercury in workers were exceededsignificantly. Nonetheless, it was found that concentrationsof arsenic were elevated above background in several individuals from both the incinerator itself and in peripheryand management workers. (Wrbitzky et al. 1995). Concentrations were highest in the incinerator workers. Thestudy concluded that the elevation probably occurred as aresult of exposure at work. Arsenic is highly carcinogenicand the study commented that the source must be identified so that exposure to workers could be reduced.2.1.4 Biomarkers Two studies used biomarkers to investigate exposure of workers to hazardous chemicals. One study indicated thatworkers might be exposed to increased levels of PAHs andanother showed that they might be exposed to elevatedlevels of electrophilic compounds such as PAHs. NRC (2000) reviewed a study by Angerer (1992) which investigated levels of various organic chemicals in the bloodand urine of 53 workers from a MSW incinerator inGermany compared to 431 control subjects (see alsoabove, section 2.1.2). The study reported elevated levels ofhydroxypyrene in the urine of workers. Hydroxypyrene isknown to be a good indicator of internal exposure to PAHs.The results showing higher hydroxypyrene in workers urinesuggest, therefore, that workers had suffered higher exposure to PAHs. A study at a chemical waste incinerator was conducted which examined thioether concentrations in the urine ofworkers (Van Doorn et al. 1981). Thioethers excreted in the urine are the end products of detoxification of electrophiliccompounds in the body such as PAHs and benzene. Theycan therefore be used as a biomarker to indicate the extentto which an individual has been exposed to electrophiliccompounds. The study tested the urine of 3 workers fromthe incinerator both before work and after work. Resultswere compared to urine samples taken at the same timesfrom non-exposed men at the plant. The study revealed thatthioethers in the urine of the incineration workers was consistently higher following work compared to the start ofthe working day. This pattern of thioether excretion was notobserved in the non-exposed control subjects. Moreover,the level of thioethers in urine in the incineration workersafter work was consistently higher than thioethers in controlsubjects. From these results the study concluded that incineration workers were likely to inhale or absorb electrophilic compounds while at work, which were subsequently metabolised and excreted as thioethers in urine. 2.1.5 Mutagenic Compounds Mutagenic compounds, also termed mutagens, are compounds that have the ability to damage DNA in cells of the body. Studies have shown that mutagenic compounds are present in incinerator emissions to air and in incinerator ashes. According to Ma et al. (1992), mutagenic compounds that are present in incineratorreleases of gases, particulates and in ashes inevitably result in the exposure of incinerator workers to these compounds. One study on incinerator workers, discussed in this section, indicated that internal exposure to mutagenic compounds in the workplace might occur.INCINERATION AND HUMAN HEAL TH22Laboratory studies have shown that incinerator emissions to air (e.g. Fomin and Hafner 1998, DeMarini et al. 1996), and fly ashes and bottom ashes (e.g. Shane et al. 1993), are mutagenic. Incinerator emissions to air consist of a complexmixture of organic chemicals and other elements. Withinthe organic fraction, it has been proposed that mutagenicitymay be due to just one or a few chemical classes presentin the chemical mixture. A recent study identified PAHs andnitroarenes (nitro-aromatic hydrocarbons) as being important contributors to the mutagenicity of incineratoremissions (DeMarini et al. 1996). To investigate exposure to mutagens in workers, Scarlett et al. (1990) conducted a study to determine whether mutagenic compounds were present in the urine of incinerator workers. The study found that municipal wasteincineration workers had a significantly increased frequencyof mutagenic compounds in their urine compared to a control group of water treatment workers. Further researchon workers from the same incineration plants was conducted to determine whether the quantity of mutagensin urine was consistently elevated in the workers or variedwith time (Ma et al. 1992). The first in a series of tests again showed significantly increased mutagens in the urineof incinerator workers compared to water treatment workers. However, further tests showed lower frequenciesof mutagens in urine of the incinerator workers. At thesame time, the quantity of mutagens in the urine of waterworkers remained consistent. The study noted that likelyexplanations for lower amounts of mutagens in the urine ofincineration workers on second and third testing was thatexposure to mutagens in the incinerator workplace is highlyvariable. Alternatively, or in addition to this, the workers whowere being investigated may have taken extra measures toreduce their exposure by wearing protective clothing andmasks after they suspected that they were being exposedto toxicants. Although mutations play a role in the processof carcinogenesis, the study noted that the presence ofmutagens in the urine of incinerator workers did not establish per se, that mutations were taking place. Hence, itwas not possible to relate these findings to an evaluation of the likelihood of cancer or other adverse health outcome through this particular study although the findings are suggestive. 2.2 Health Impacts Studies on mortality and morbidity (illness) among incinerator workers are very limited innumber. Research hasreported a broad range of health impacts associated withworking atincinerators including death from heart diseaseand certain cancers and hyperlipidemia, allergy and hypertension. One study reported chloracne in a highlyexposed worker, a condition specifically associated withdioxin exposure. 2.2.1 Mortality Gustavsson (1989) investigated mortality among 1 76 incinerator workers who were employed for one year ormore between 1920 and 1985 at a municipal waste incinerator in Sweden. The study noted that the workingenvironment at this incinerator was more contaminated thanwould be expected at modern incineration plants. Resultsrevealed an excess of ischemic heart disease. It was calculated that the excess was caused by occupational factors. The excess was found to be highest and (statistically significant) in workers with more than 40 years exposure. An excess of deaths from lung cancer was also found in the study. Compared with national rates of lung cancer inSweden, the workers had a 3.5-fold higher probability ofdying from lung cancer. Compared with local lung cancerrates they had a 2-fold higher likelihood of dying from thedisease. The small sample size in the study precluded fully conclusive statements with respect to the statisticalsignificance of the rate of lung cancer among workers(Marty 1993). Gustavsson et al. (1993) point out, however, that analysis of the exposure time and latency period suggested that it was improbable that the high rates of lungcancer among workers were due to smoking. Additionally,according to calculations from previous studies, only veryexcessive smoking habits (100% smokers) could producethe size of cancer excess seen in this study. It was notedthat exposure of workers to polycyclic organic compounds,especially PAHs, may have been be an important factor inthe lung cancer excess. The study also found a 1.5-fold increased probability of death from oesophageal cancer. Taken in the context of thestudy on its own, the evidence for an occupational origin ofoesophageal cancer was weak. However, other studies onworkers in Sweden exposed to combustion products, forexample, gas workers, chimney sweeps and bus garageworkers have also reported an excess of oesophageal cancer. Considering the results of excess oesophageal cancer among incinerator workers in the context of theseother studies supports the existence of an increased healththreat due to occupational exposure. It appears that thisincreased threat cannot be attributed to cigarette smokingand alcohol consumption which are both known contributory factors (Gustavsson et al. 1993). In contrast to the above study by Gustavsson (1989), a study on 532 workers employed at two municipal wasteincinerators in Rome, Italy, between 1962 and 1992 did notfind an excess of lung cancer (Rapiti et al. 1997). Mortality from lung cancer was reduced in comparison to the generalpopulation and cancer mortality from all cancers combinedwas similar to that of the general population. However,there was a 2.79-fold increased likelihood of dying fromINCINERATION AND HUMAN HEAL TH 23gastric cancer among the workers. This excess probability was evident for workers who had more than 10 years latency since first employment. Increased gastric cancerhas also been observed among sewage workers and, tosome extent, incinerator workers have similar occupationalexposures such as to inhalation of volatile pathogens, bacterial toxins and organic dust. There are also other contributory factors for gastric cancer including alcohol consumption, deficient intake of fruit and vegetables andlower socio-economic status. Such factors could have beenpresent in the incinerator workers in this study and mayexplain the excess of gastric cancers to some extent. Thestudy concluded that incinerator workers deserve increasedsurveillance by means of epidemiological studies and therole of dust and bacterial toxins in waste managementrequires further investigation. 2.2.2 Morbidity Kitamura et al. (2000) investigated morbidity in 94 municipal incinerator workers who had worked at an incinerator in Japan. The incinerator had operated between1988 and 1997 when it was closed due to high stack emissions of dioxins which resulted in contamination oflocal soil. The study found elevated dioxin levels in theblood of workers (range 13.3 to 805.8 ppt TEQ, mean 93.5ppt TEQ (lipid basis) (see also section 2. 1.1). At blood dioxin levels above 100 ppt TEQ, a statistically significantrelationship with hyperlipidemia was found. In addition,there was a marginal correlation between dioxin levels and allergy. However, the study noted that these healthconditions were self-reported by the workers and that confirmation of the diagnosis may be necessary becausethere was no association between dioxin levels and plasma lipid levels. Investigations of blood biochemistry did not find any significant associations with dioxin levels in the blood ofworkers although some decreased liver function was noted. Tests for the immune system revealed significantassociations between dioxin blood levels and natural killer(NK) cell activity and PHA stimulation. Dioxin has previouslybeen associated with effects on the immune system andthe authors noted that consequently a follow-up study was necessary. The study also investigated the sex ratio of children born to workers. Theoretically the number of female and malechildren born should be equal, but in reality there is a veryslight male excess (see discussion section 3.2.3). In thisstudy, when the workers were divided into high (greaterthan 49 ppt TEQ dioxins in blood) and low (less than 49ppt TEQ) exposure groups, there were 16 boys and 1 7 girlsborn to the low exposure workers. This compared to 2 boys and 5 girls among the high exposure group. The slightexcess in the number of females born in the high exposuregroup was not, however, considered to be statistically significant. A study by Bresnitz et al. (1992) was conducted on morbidity amongst 86 MSW incinerator workers in the US.The study investigated several different health parameters. It divided the workers into two hypothetical groups, thoseconsidered to experience high exposure in the workplaceand those with low exposure. Results revealed an excess of workers (31%) who had urinary abnormalities, namelysignificant proteinuria (protein in the urine). For this effect,however, no difference was apparent between the high andthe low exposure groups. The prevalence of hypertensionwas also above normal among the workers and it was suggested that the hypertension might explain theincreased prevalence of proteinuria. Tests on lung functionin the workers showed that this parameter was affected bysmoking status. Tests also suggested an increased potentialfor small airway obstruction of the lungs although the diagnosis was not confirmed. The high exposure group had a 19% increased likelihood of possible small airwayobstruction of the lungs compared to the low exposuregroup. Among workers who had never smoked in thegroups, there was an 85% increased potential for small airway obstruction in the high exposure group. The studyconcluded that additional studies were needed to assessthe potential health effects of MSW incinerator by-products.The authors also suggested that increased efforts in reducing personal risk factors and potential occupationalexposures were needed in order to reduce morbidityamong incinerator workers. Schecter et al. (1999) found particularly high dioxin levels in the blood of two men several years after they hadworked at an old Japanese waste incinerator (see also section 2. 1.1). One worker, who had a dioxin level of 360 ppt TEQ, had chloracne, a skin condition caused by exposure to dioxin. The other worker, who had a dioxinlevel of 278 ppt TEQ, did not have chloracne. At the time of the investigation he was recovering from two episodes of gastrointestinal cancer of unknown aetiology (medical cause).INCINERATION AND HUMAN HEAL TH243. HEALTH IMPACTS ON POPULATIONS LIVINGNEAR TO INCINERATORSINCINERATION AND HUMAN HEAL TH 25Hens et al. (2000) note that incinerator release of pollutants to air and to water is effectively a dilution and dispersal ofpollutants over space and time. This causes a slow, butgradual accumulation of pollutants in the food chain andthe human body, such that health effects may often onlybecome visible and measurable after a long latency period 3.1 Exposure Studies A limited number of studies have been conducted to determine whether individuals residing near to incineratorshave been exposed to pollutants. Studies are restricted toinvestigations of exposure to dioxins and heavy metals.Results of these studies are mixed. Some reported elevatedexposure among nearby residents while others found noevidence of increased exposure. 3.1.1 Dioxins and PCBs Three studies have reported increases in dioxin levels in residents living near to incinerators, while two studies have found no evidence of increased exposure. One studyalso reported that certain PCB congeners were possiblyincreased in the blood of child residents. Gonzalez et al. (2000) investigated exposure in residents living in the vicinity of a newly built incinerator in Matar\u00f3Spain, both before and two years after the plant startedrunning. The study determined the level of dioxins in 1995and again in 1997 in pooled blood samples from 104 individuals living between 0.5 and 1.5 km from the incinerator and from 97 individuals in subjects living furtheraway at between 3.5 to 4.0 km. In 1995, prior to start up ofthe incinerator, dioxin levels in blood of those living nearand those living farther away were 13.5 ppt TEQ and 13.4ppt TEQ, respectively. In 1997 after 2 years of operation ofthe incinerator, dioxin levels had increased in both groupsof people by about 25% and PCBs increased by about 12%. When further repeated analyses were conducted, theincrease in dioxins among residents was of the order of 10to 15%, rather than 25%. The increase in dioxins was notdifferent in the residents living near to the incinerator andthose living further away and the authors commented thatthe increase in dioxin blood levels was unlikely to be attributable to the incinerator. The incinerator's dioxin stack emissions were reported as 0.98-2.5ng TEQ/m 3. A study in Japan was undertaken in an area close to a MSW incinerator for which high local dioxins in soil (seesection 4.2.1), and an unusually high rate of cancer (2-foldexcess) among residents, had been reported (Miyata et al. 1998). The study tested blood samples from 13 womenand 5 men living within 2 km of the incinerator. Levels ofdioxins were raised considerably in the residents comparedto background levels found in the general population. Forinstance, women had an average blood level of 149 pgTEQ/g lipid and men 81 pg TEQ/g lipid, whereas the background level for the general population is in the rangeof 15 to 29 pg TEQ/g lipid. The authors commented thatincreased exposure in the residents was considered to bedue to direct inhalation of dioxins from the stack gas of theincinerator and by intake of local vegetables contaminatedby stack gas. Following reports of high levels of dioxins in cow's milk at farms near to Coalite chemicals, in Derbyshire, UK where anincinerator was operating prior to 1991 (see also section4.2.2), a study was undertaken on levels of dioxins in theblood of 10 residents from the farms (Startin et al. 1994). Results of the study revealed elevated levels of dioxins inblood of all the residents. Their blood levels were comparedto available data on background dioxin levels for theGerman population since no relevant UK data were available. Three of the residents had blood levels (49, 85and 95 pg TEQ/g lipid) which were just above or at theupper end of background levels, and the other 7 residentshad levels (137-291 pg TEQ/g lipid) that were unmistakablyhigher than background levels. Holdke et al. (1998) analysed levels of PCBs in the blood of 348 children between the ages of seven and ten years wholived near a hazardous waste incinerator in Germany. Theresults were compared to a control group of children wholived in a region with similar industrial pollution and with asecond control group of children who lived in an area withlower industrial pollution. Among those who lived in thevicinity of the hazardous waste incinerator, PCB 1 70 andPCB 180 were present at statistically significant higher concentrations, while PCB 183 and PCB 187 were detectedwith greater frequency than among the control childrenfrom the area with lower industrial pollution. According to the study, while the results can only be viewed as aregional comparison of the three groups and the effectssmall, the statistically significant results do indicate aregionally plausible pattern. Two other studies in Europe have found no increase in levels of dioxins of individuals residing close to incinerators.Deml et al. (1996) sampled blood from 39 persons and breast milk from 7 persons in 1993 who lived near to aMSW incinerator in Germany. The study reported that therewas no indication of increased blood levels of dioxins in theresidents. Levels of dioxins in the blood (mean 1 7.0 ppt TEQlipid, range 5.2 to 34.5 ppt TEQ lipid) and breast milk(mean 12.4 ppt range 6 to 19 ppt TEQ lipid) ofresidents were not significantly different from backgroundlevels in the German population (range 10 to 48 ppt TEQlipid in blood and mean 30 ppt TEQ lipid in breast milk). Similarly, a study on exposure of a limited number of residents (five) living near to an incinerator in Duiven, TheINCINERATION AND HUMAN HEAL TH26Netherlands, did not find increased dioxin levels in their blood (van den Hazel and Frankort 1996). This study wasundertaken specifically to test whether residents had elevated levels of dioxin congeners in their bodies becauseof their potential exposure to fly ash blown away from thestorage site near the waste incinerator. Levels of dioxins inblood of the residents (mean 31.4 ppt TEQ lipid) were similar to levels in the control group of 5 individuals fromthe Dutch general population (mean 33.8 ppt TEQ lipid). Inaddition, the study did not find increases in the levels of any particular dioxin congeners amongst the residents. 3.1.2 Heavy Metals Only one study was located in the scientific literature on exposure to heavy metals in individuals residing near toincinerators. Kurttio et al. (1998) investigated changes in the level of mercury between 1984 and 1994 in the hair of 113individuals who lived near to a hazardous waste incineratorin Finland. Mercury concentrations were found to increasein workers at the plant (see section 2.1.3) and in residentssuch that levels increased with decreasing distance fromthe incinerator. For example, levels increased by 0.16 mg/kg in residents living 1.5-2 km (high exposure group) from the plant, 0.13mg/kg at 2.5-3.7 km (medium exposure group) and 0.03mg/kg at about 5km (low exposure group). The results indicated that the incinerator was the likely source of exposure among residents. Exposure was most likely mainly due to inhalation and possibly via ingestion of localwell water and vegetables. The authors concluded that theincrease in mercury concentrations in the residents overtime was small and, on the basis of current knowledge, did not pose a health threat. 3.1.3 Biomarkers The theory behind using biomarkers in epidemiology studies relies on early biological effects of a toxic exposure,(i.e. the biomarker), being more prevalent and easier todetect in a potentially exposed population than clinical disease. A study conducted at a recently built incinerator in Spain, compared children living in the vicinity to children living outside the zone of influence of the incinerator using urinarythioethers as a biomarker (Ardevol et al. 1999). The use of urinary thioethers as a biomarker relies on the fact thatwhen electrophilic compounds such as PAHs are detoxifiedin the body, the metabolic end products can be detected as thioethers in the urine. Electrophilic compounds are generally potent mutagenic and carcinogenic compounds. The study assessed the possible contribution of incinerator releases to urinary thioethers in children aged 7-10 during1997. Research on children, rather than on adults, eliminatesother potential effects on health that may interfere with study results, including smoking or occupational or otherlifestyle toxicants. The study reported that there was agreater quantity of urinary thioethers in the urine of childrenliving near to the incinerator than the control group of children living further away, although the result was not statistically significant. The study also found that parental smoking of tobacco predicted a statistically significantly greater quantity of urinary thioethers in children of both groups. In addition,among children who were exposed to smoking by bothparents in the home, there was a significantly greater quantity of thioethers in urine from the incinerator groupcompared to the control group. It is possible that this effectwas caused by a greater extent of exposure to tobaccosmoke in these children. Alternatively, it may have beencaused by the addition of exposure to the tobacco smokeand exposure to incinerator releases. In the case of releasesfrom incinerators, the higher amounts of thioethers in urineof the children may have been caused by exposure to PAHsand possibly dioxins. 3.2 Health Effects - Epidemiological Studies The majority of epidemiological studies on the health of populations residing near to incinerators have focusedeither on incidence of cancer or of respiratory symptoms.Additionally, some research has investigated other potentialeffects including congenital abnormalities and changes in the sex ratio. Considering the widespread use ofincinerators on a global scale, the number of studies thathave investigated health effects in residents near to thesefacilities is sparse. 3.2.1 Cancer Some of the substances emitted from incinerator stacks, including cadmium, PAHs and dioxin (TCDD), have beenclassified as human carcinogens or likely/possible humancarcinogens by the International Agency for Research onCancer (McGregor et al. 1998, see Elliot et al. 1996). A number of studies have been undertaken on cancer incidence on populations living near to incinerators or other industrial sites. The majority of these studies havefound an association between elevated rates of cancers and living close to incinerators or other industrial sites,including childhood cancer. Most research in this fieldnecessitates consideration of exposure to material releasedfrom incinerators over a number of years because the timetaken for cancer to develop (the latency period) is long formany cancers. Soft Tissue Sarcoma and Non-Hodgkin's Lymphoma A study in the area of Doubs, eastern France, was INCINERATION AND HUMAN HEAL TH 27conducted to investigate clustering of two types of cancer, soft tissue sarcoma and non-Hodgkin's lymphoma, near toa MSW (Viel et al. 2000). The study was undertaken following a report of high dioxin emissions from the incinerator. The study found highly significant clusters ofboth cancers in areas close to the incinerator but not inother surrounding regions. In a press release in 1998, the French Ministry of the Environment revealed that 7 1 MSW incinerators had dioxin emissions to atmosphere above 10 ng I-TEQ/m 3. One of the incinerators, Bescan\u00e7on, had a reported dioxin air emission of 16.3 ng I-TEQ/m3. A general cancer registry covered the area local to this incinerator and this provided an oppor-tunity for researchers to study the incidence of cancer inthe region. Soft tissue sarcoma and non-Hodgkin's lymphoma were selected for investigation because previouswork has suggested that dioxins increase the probability of contracting these cancers. The incinerator had operatedfrom 197 1 onwards. The study divided the region of Doubs into 26 areas (statistical units) for the purpose of the analysis. During theperiod 1980 to 1995, 110 cases of soft tissue sarcoma and803 cases of non-Hodgkin's lymphoma were recorded.Analysis showed that statistically significant clusters of bothcancers were present in 2 of the 26 areas, Bescan\u00e7on andAudeux that were closest to the incinerator. There was a44% increased incidence of soft tissue sarcoma and a 27%increased incidence in non-Hodgkin's lymphoma. No otherclusters were found in the remaining 24 areas. Possibleconfounding factors of socio-economic status and urbanisation were discussed as unlikely to bias results.Furthermore, to make sure that distance to health centresdid not confound the results (that is, due to closer residence and the consequent wider access to specialisedcare leading to more frequent cancer diagnoses), the studyalso considered the frequency of Hodgkin's disease as acontrol cancer. Hodgkin's disease is a cancer that is notassociated with dioxin exposure. The study found no clusters of Hodgkin's lymphoma within the entire studyarea. The authors concluded from this that the clusters of soft tissue sarcoma and non-Hodgkin's lymphoma nearthe incinerator were not attributable to the presence ofUniversity Hospital in the Bescan\u00e7on -Audeux area resultingin more reliable diagnosis of the diseases. In conclusion, the authors stated that the consistency of the findings for clustering of soft tissue sarcoma and non-Hodgkin's lymphoma around the incinerator wasremarkable. However, they cautioned that before clusters of both these cancers are attributed to dioxin release fromthe incinerator, the findings should be confirmed by furtherinvestigation. If dioxin is involved, the route of exposureamong residents remains to be determined. Lung Cancer A study in Trieste, an industrialised city in northeast Italy, was undertaken to investigate the impact of air pollutionfrom a number of sources (ship yard, iron foundry, incinerator and city centre) on lung cancer (Biggeri et al. 1996). It found that the prevalence of all types of lung cancer was increased both by residence close to the incinerator and to the city centre. The method used in this study involved the identification of individual subjects who had died from lung cancer in the region, and subsequently, the identification of matchedcontrol individuals who had died at a similar time but notfrom cancer or lung disease. A total of 755 male individualswho had died from lung cancer between 1979 and 1981 or between 1985 and 1986 were identified. The two enrolment periods were selected to cover an extended period of time bearing in mind the costs of the study.Analysis of results accounted for confounding factorsincluding smoking habits, age, likelihood of exposure to carcinogens in the workplace, and approximate levels of air particulate. Results of the study showed there was a statistically significant increased probability of dying from all types oflung cancer among people living by the incinerator. Thelikelihood of dying from lung cancer for individuals livingwithin a short distance of the incinerator was 6.7 timesgreater than for those living in other areas. Independentlyfrom this, living close to the city centre was also associatedwith a higher probability of death from lung cancer (2.2-fold higher at the city centre). This study confirmed the findings of a previous study in Trieste, which had alsoidentified an increased likelihood of lung cancer in theneighbourhood of the incinerator (Babone et al. 1994). Some possible confounding of results through factors suchas length of time at the death address, (i.e. change of residence), could not be excluded. The study concludedthat the results provided further evidence that air pollution is a moderate contributory factor for lung cancer and thatthis was consistent with the hypothesis of an independentimpact on health of residing close to the incinerator and to the city centre. Cancer of the larynx An investigation of cancer rates around an incinerator of waste solvents and oils at Charnock Richard, Lancashire, UKwas undertaken during the late 1980's by the local council.Statistical analysis of the results identified a significantexcess of cancer of the larynx close to the incinerator,which decreased as distance from the incinerator increased(Diggle et al. 1990). Following this report, another study was undertaken to investigate incidence of laryngeal cancerat this incinerator and at nine other similar incinerators inthe UK which began operation before 1979 (Elliot et al.INCINERATION AND HUMAN HEAL TH281992). This study found no excess of larynx or lung cancers up to 10 km from the incinerator sites when lag periods(between incinerator start up and cancer incidence) of 5 and 10 years were used. Consequently, the study concluded that the apparent cluster of cases of cancer ofthe larynx at Charnock Richard, Lancashire, was unlikely to be due to the incinerator. However, there were severalrecognised limitations in the data used in this study. For instance, the lag time of 5 and 10 years for the development of laryngeal cancer is short considering theepidemiology of solid tumours. A study on mustard gasworkers, for example, showed that cancer of the larynx wasevident only after a follow-up of at least 10 years since firstemployment and another study showed excess mortalityfrom larynx cancer in workers exposed to dioxin was onlyapparent after 20 years. A more recent study on the incidence of various cancers in a population living within the vicinity of an incinerator, awaste disposal site, and an oil refinery plant in Rome whichhad operated since the early 1960s, did find an increasedprobability of mortality from cancer of the larynx (Michelozzi et al. 1998). The investigation was undertaken following concerns about pollution from the industries affecting theresident population. No excesses were found for liver, lungand lymphohaematopoietic cancers. However, an increasedlikelihood of cancer of the larynx was evident at 0-3 and 3-8 km distance from the industries, although the resultwas not statistically significant. Nevertheless, the authorshypothesised a possible link between emissions from theindustries and larynx cancer since there was a statisticallysignificant decline in this cancer among men with increasing distance from the industries. The study notedthat this was interesting because results from other studieson cancer incidence in the vicinity of these industries wereconflicting. It concluded that the results for laryngeal cancerwere based on a limited number of cases, and further studies would be necessary to determine whether the presence of refineries or incinerators actually does representa factor contributing to an increased probability of contracting this disease in resident populations. Liver Cancer and Other Cancers A study was undertaken on cancer incidence in individuals living near to incinerators in Great Britain as a consequenceof concerns about possible health effects of residing closeto these facilities (Elliot et al. 1996). The research showed a statistically significant excess of liver cancer among residents. The study investigated cancer incidence among over 14 million people living within 7 .5 km of 72 MSW incinerators.Data on cancer incidence among residents from 1974-1987was compiled using the national cancer registrationscheme. Cancer incidence rates for populations living closeto incinerators were compared with national cancer rates to determine whether there was excess of observed numbersof cancer cases versus expected numbers. Results showedthat there were statistically significant excesses of all cancers combined and of stomach, colorectal, liver andlung cancer for populations living within 7 .5 km of incinerators. The incidence of cancer decreased withincreasing distance from the incinerators. The greatestincreased probability of occurrence was found for liver cancer, for which there was 37% excess from 0 to 1 kmdistance from incinerators compared to national rates.However, further analysis of the data indicated that theexcesses of all cancers combined and of stomach and lungcancer were likely to be due to confounding, in this casesocial deprivation. Social deprivation tends to be high inpolluted areas and it is strongly predictive of disease occurrence. With regard to liver cancer it was noted thatsocial deprivation could account for at least part of theincreased likelihood of contracting this disease as observedin the study. It was also noted that there was some misdiagnosis of primary liver cancer due to secondary livertumours (i.e. tumours arising subsequently to, and as aresult of, other types of primary tumours). The study concluded that further research would be needed to confirm whether or not there was an excess of primary livercancer in the vicinity of incinerators. Further work on thediagnosis of liver cancer in this study was subsequentlycarried out (Elliot et al. 2000). It also indicated an increase in the rate of liver cancer in residents living near to incinerators. The initial study (Elliot et al. 1996) utilised information recorded on death certificates. For further analysis of thedata, the second study, (Elliot et al. 2000), included a review of histology slides and reports and medical recordsin order to clarify whether liver cancers were primary cancers or secondary cancers. Out of the 235 originalcases of liver cancer recorded on death certificates a reviewof 119 cases (51%) was performed. Primary liver cancerwas confirmed in 55% of these cases and secondary cancers in 18%. If these figures are used to re-calculate theincidence of liver cancer in the first study, the excess of37% liver cancers (23 cases) reported in the first study isreduced to 12.6 cases, and 18.8 cases when only definitesecondary cancers are excluded. This translates to 0.53 and0.78 excess cases per 1,000,000 cases per year (or anincreased probability of contracting liver cancer of 20 and30% within 1 km distance of MSW incinerators). The studyconcluded that the true excess would be expected to liesomewhere between these two figures. The study couldnot rule out the possibility of confounding on the resultsfrom social deprivation. Elliot et al. (2000) commented that if the findings of excess liver cancers in this and the INCINERATION AND HUMAN HEAL TH 29previous study were caused by residence near to MSW incinerators, then the results related to historical exposurepatterns around these installations. Childhood Cancer An analysis by Knox (2000) has recently been published that used data on MSW incinerators from the initial studyby Elliot et al. (1996), (see above), to determine whether the likelihood of contracting childhood cancer is increased nearto incinerators. The study considered childhood canceraround 70 and 307hospital waste incinerators between 1953-1980. Latentintervals for childhood cancers are short and this mitigatesproblems of the often-longer latency periods for cancer inadults encountered in the \"all ages\" study by Elliot et al. (1996). The analysis used a newly developed, sensitive method that could consider the distance of the birthaddress of each child from an incinerator and also thedeath address, if this was different. In this regard, the\"migration method\" used for this analysis could comparedistances from incinerators to the birth addresses and todeath addresses of children with cancer who had movedhouse. The study identified an increased incidence of childcancer in children who were born near to incinerators. The developmental stages of life are generally the most vulnerable to toxic insult. Thus, exposure of the developingfoetus in the womb and during the early stages of life totoxic substances may lead to a greater potentila for adverseeffects on health, such as cancer, than exposure in lateryears. In the study by Knox (2000), if exposures to toxicsubstances from living near to an incinerator during theearly stages of life predicted an increase in cancer incidence, then there would be closer associations with thebirth address of children rather than with the death address. Results of the analysis indeed showed a highly statistically significant excess of migration away from birthplaces closeto incinerators within 5 km of the sites. Thus, exposure toincinerators at the birth address, and hence during the earlydevelopmental stages of life, was associated with a higherprobability of contracting cancer than exposure at the deathaddress or exposure in later years. For children who wereborn within a distance of 5 km of MSW incinerators, therewas a 2-fold increase in the probability of dying from cancer. These results are also in agreement with previous research which showed an increased likelihood of childhood cancerin children who were born within a short distance of hospital waste incinerators, large-scale high temperaturecombustion sources or installations emitting VOCs 1998). The excess numbers of leukaemias andsolid tumours of all types were similar to those found in the study on childhood cancer in the vicinity of MSW incinerators by Knox (2000). This phenomenon was also observed in previous studies on proximity of childhood cancer to industrial sites and exposures to pre-natal medicalradiation. Such a result would be expected foragents/chemicals that have systemic access (i.e. access viathe circulation) to the DNA/RNA in all types of foetal cells(Knox 2000). The study conducted by Knox and Gilman (1998) on the level of childhood cancers near to many different industriesconcluded that increased cancer rates were apparent in children born near to hospital incinerators, other combustion sources and industries emitting VOCs. Fromthese results it was concluded that multiple toxic sourcesare responsible for many birth -time or pre-birth (foetal) initiations of cancer. This effect on the developing young islikely to be mediated through various VOCs and products of combustion. With regard to waste incineration itself, concordance of results on childhood cancer from MSWincinerators (Knox 2000) and hospital waste incinerators(Knox and Gilman 1998) suggests a common direct effectof being born near to incinerators and childhood cancer.Knox (2000) noted, however, that it is difficult to saywhether the apparent cancer-related threats to health nearincinerators might also stem from other hazards in the nearby environments. In this regard, the most \"toxic\" incinerators in the study were close to industrial sources of kinds implicated in previous studies. For this reason, the present overall conclusion of the study was that theincreased probability of childhood cancer stems from residence near to large-scale combustion processes as a whole, of which incinerators are one component (Knox 2000). 3.2.2 Respiratory Effects Incinerators, in particular cement kilns, emit considerable quantities of SO2and NO2. Long term exposure to these substances is known to have negative impacts on respiratory health (see e.g. Ayres 1998). Similarly, incinerators emit fine particulate matter and many studieshave reported that long term exposure to particulate matteris associated with adverse effects on respiratory symptoms(see further appendix A). Despite the potential negativeimpacts on respiratory health from substances known to be emitted from incinerators, there have been only a limitednumber of epidemiological studies on respiratory effects in individuals who live near to incinerators. Of the researchthat has been undertaken, some studies have suggestednegative impacts on respiratory health whilst others havefound no effect. An early study by Zmirou (1984) suggested there was an increased use of medication for respiratory illnesses amongresidents living near to a MSW incinerator in a French village. The study found that medicines for respiratory INCINERATION AND HUMAN HEAL TH30problems such as bronchodilators, expectorants and cough medicines were purchased significantly more often at distances closer to the incinerator. The investigators pointedout that it is not possible to conclude a cause-effect relationship from this study, but stated that the observationmade by the study is consistent with the hypothesis thatpollution generated by the incinerator may exacerbate respiratory problems (see: Marty 1993). At a hazardous waste incinerator in western North Carolina, US, an investigation of the health of nearby residents wasconducted following reports of illness and neurologicalsymptoms in workers employed at the plant (ATSDR 1993).After adjustment for confounding factors such as age, sexand cigarette smoking, the study found significant increasesin the prevalence of self-reported respiratory symptoms. Forinstance, residents living near to the incinerator were almostnine times more likely to report recurrent wheezing orcough compared to residents living further from the site,and they were almost two times more likely to report otherrespiratory symptoms. In addition, chest pain, poor co-ordination, dizziness and irritative symptoms were alsosignificantly elevated. However, no difference between the two groups was reported for the prevalence of physician-diagnosed diseases and hospital admissions for these diseases. Although this study found an increase in respiratory symptoms among residents living near to anincinerator there are several concerns surrounding thestudy, which limit the interpretation of the findings. Forinstance, according to a review of this study by NRC(2000), there are concerns regarding the retrospectivenature of the study (incinerator operated from 1977 to 1988and the study was not conducted until 1991), and regardingadverse publicity before the incinerator shutdown. The NRCcommented that the study was of limited utility in evaluating the effect of incinerator exposures. A study in Taiwan investigated the respiratory health of children living near a wire-reclamation incinerator andreported associated adverse effects on lung function (Wang et al. 1992). The study tested 86 primary school children and compared the results to a control group of 92 childrenfrom a \"non-polluted\" city. Air pollution in the incineratordistrict as measured by SO 2and NO2, was notably greater than in the comparison city. Questionnaires administered to the children revealed no differences in respiratory symptoms. However, abnormal forced expiratory volume in 1 second (FEV1 ), a measure of lung function, was significantly greater in the incinerator group (1 7.5%) than the control group (3.2%). Further testing of lung function of 26 children from each group revealed a positive methacholine-challenge test in 9 of the incinerator groupbut only 1 of the control group. From these results, theauthors concluded that the high level of air pollution towhich the children living near to the incinerator wereexposed was associated with a detrimental effect on lung function. A review of this study by NRC (2000) noted that the study appears to demonstrate that higher concentrations of air pollutants alter lung function in children, but does not directly allow any inference about the contribution of incinerators as opposed to other pollutant sources to the observed health effects. In the US, it has become common practice for hazardous wastes to be used as part of the fuel to achieve high temperatures during cement kiln operation. A study conducted on cement kilns operating in Midlothian, Texas,documented statistically significant increased self-reportedrespiratory symptoms among a sample of nearby residentsas compared to residents living further away (Legator et al. 1998). Risk assessments based on measurements of incinerator emissions recorded in 1997/8 in the area hadreported that there was no threat posed to human healthfrom the cement kilns (see Legator et al. 1998). In addition, a study by the Department of Health in the region in 1992concluded that there \"did not appear to be any consistent patterns of illness or symptoms that might be an indication of ...a common-source health problem among the study respondents\". However, subsequent analysis of both the above pieces of research concluded that there were deficiencies, flawsand inadequacies in the methodology of the studies. Sincethen, Legator et al. (1998) have conducted research aimed at identifying whether exposure of nearby residents to pollutants from the cement kilns resulted in adverse health effects. A randomised sample of 58 individuals living near to the incinerators was selected and requested to undergo aninterview based on an extensive health questionnaire. Theresults were compared to a control group of 54 individualswho lived further away from the incinerators. The studyshowed that no areas of health appeared to be significantlyadversely affected with the exception of the respiratory category. The population living close to the incineratorsreported significantly higher frequencies of respiratorysymptoms (p = 0.002) than the control group. All of therespiratory symptoms on the questionnaire, including lungdisease, wheezing, emphysema, persistent cough and bronchitis were elevated, the only exception being pneumonia. The study was not subject to some of the limitations that can hinder studies of this nature such asbiases on questionnaire reporting. In addition, the controlpopulation was older than the incinerator-exposed population and since older individuals are more sensitive to the effects of chemicals, it is likely that impacts on theincinerator-exposed population were underestimated. TheINCINERATION AND HUMAN HEAL TH 31study concluded that the results add to the growing body of information that persons living next to incinerator-generated air pollution experience increasedprevalence of respiratory symptoms. Gray et al. (1994) conducted a study on the incidence of asthma among two groups of children living near sewagesludge incinerators in Sydney, Australia. Respiratory illnesswas monitored by way of questionnaire, and various physiological tests, including tests on lung function. Thestudy found no adverse effect on either the prevalence orthe severity of asthma in the children compared to a controlcomparison group of children living in a different region ofSydney. In addition, no differences were apparent in lungfunction. Measurements of SO x, NOx, hydrogen sulphide, ozone (O3) and particulate matter did not detect any statistically significant differences between the incinerator and comparison areas. The study concluded that releasesfrom high-temperature sewage-sludge incineratorsappeared to have no adverse effect on the prevalence orseverity of childhood asthma. A study in the US reported no significant difference in levels of particulate air pollution or respiratory health incommunities residing near to three waste incinerators from1992 to 1994 (Shy et al. 1995). The study was conducted on three communities living near to a municipal, hazardousand medical waste incinerator in North Carolina US andthree comparison communities that were more than 3 kmupwind of incinerators. The study simultaneously monitoredair quality in the communities and respiratory health effectsin individuals. In all, 6963 individuals participated in a telephone survey of respiratory health over the course of 3 years and 100-144 individuals per community per year participated inhaving tests on lung function. Shy et al. (1995) reported results for the first year of the three-year study. The studyfound no significant difference in the concentration of particulate matter (PM10) in the incinerator communitiesrelative to the comparison communities. Incinerators werecalculated to contribute to less than 3% of particulate matter measured in the communities, the remainder comingfrom other sources around the region. However, consistently higher levels of particulate zinc, lead, and chloride were found in incinerator communities when windswere coming from the direction of the medical and MSWincinerators. The study noted that if a chemical componentof incinerator releases can cause respiratory effects in an exposed community, standard measures of air pollution may fail to detect the relevant differences in human exposure.With regard to respiratory health in the study, no significant differences were found in respiratory symptoms recordedby telephone survey between the incinerator and comparison communities. In addition, results of lung function from this study for 1992/3, plus a subsequentmore in depth analysis of lung function (Lee and Shy 1999)did not find any relationship between particulate levels(PM10) in the communities and lung function. Furthermore,there were no apparent differences in lung functionbetween the incinerator and comparison communities. This is in contrast to previous studies which have reportedincreased respiratory effects associated with increases inPM10 (see appendix A). The different results of this studymay be because the particulate levels were relatively low by comparison with previous studies and therefore effectson lung function might not be possible to detect even ifthey existed (Shy et al. 1995). Although the above study (Shy et al. 1995) did not find an association between living near to the three particularincinerators in the study and an increase in acute or chronicrespiratory symptoms, it was emphasised that the study didhave several limitations. For instance, there was more cigarette smoking and greater use of kerosene heaters inthe homes of the comparison communities and this wouldtend to mask any moderate-sized respiratory effects in theincinerator communities. Also, a major problem was the possible significant misclassification of exposure to pollutants from the incinerators because different sectionsof the community were likely to experience different air pollution levels due to the prevailing wind direction. It wasreported that this would tend to lead towards the result ofno effect upon respiratory health. Further analysis of lungfunction results by Lee and Shy (1999) also noted that thestudy was limited by a lack of information on individualexposures to releases. The authors commented that thelack of association between PM10 and respiratory health inthe study must be interpreted cautiously because exposureestimation based on monitoring of ambient air likely resulted in misclassification of true exposure levels. 3.2.3 Sex Ratio In humans, the ratio of males to females born should theoretically be 1:1. But in reality there is a slight excess of males at birth. This may be attributable to a number ofdifferent factors including age of parents and time ofinsemination within the cycle (Moller 1996). The sex ratio has been found to vary somewhat between different countries. Abnormal sex ratios have been associated with some occupational environments, forinstance, an excess of male births was reported for taxexperts and chartered accountants and an excess of femalebirths was reported for librarians and quantity surveyors(see Williams et al. 1992). The mechanisms which causeINCINERATION AND HUMAN HEAL TH32sex ratio to vary have not been clarified but a hormonal influence has been implicated in having an effect. Recent research has indicated a decreased proportion of male births in the general population of Denmark,Netherlands, USA, Canada, and in sawmill workers whowere exposed to trichlorophenate that was contaminatedwith dioxins. It has been hypothesised that these changesin sex ratio may be caused by exposure to chemical pollution. There is some evidence for this from studies onpopulations who have been exposed to dioxins. For example, a study on the population at Seveso, Italy, whowere exposed to high levels of dioxin (TCDD) following an explosion at a chemical herbicide plant in 1976 hasinvestigated sex ratio (Mocarelli et al. 2000). Individualswere included in the study who were exposed at the timeof the accident, whether as a child or as an adult, and havesubsequently had children of their own. Exposure wasassessed by analysing blood samples taken around thetime of the accident and kept frozen in storage. The resultsshowed that increased levels of dioxin in the blood of thefathers increased the probability of siring female children.The concentration in the blood of the fathers at the time of the accident was about 20 times the estimated averageconcentration of TCDD currently found in humans in industrialised countries, although the levels in blood hadfallen in some cases by the time children were conceived.The study showed that male exposure to TCDD before andduring puberty is linked to this sex-ratio effect of siringmore females. This indicates that the time before and during puberty may be a very sensitive time for dioxin toxicity in men. Men in adulthood at the time of exposurewere also affected. Overall, the data showed that exposureof men to TCDD is linked to a lowered male/female sexratio in their offspring, which may persist for years after exposure. One study has investigated sex ratios in populations living near to incinerators. This study was carried out on residentsliving in the vicinity of two incinerators in Scotland, UK(Williams et al. 1992). For the purpose of the study, the area was hypothetically divided up into 16 different districts(by postcodes) including 6 districts further away from theincinerators, which were used as a comparison area in theanalysis of results. No difference was found in the sex ratiosof births among residents between the potentially exposedarea (comprising 3 districts) and the comparison area.However, when districts were considered individually, thearea identified as being most vulnerable to air pollution fromincinerators had a statistically significant excess of femalebirths. Another district considered to be potentially vulnerable also had an excess of female births and anotherhad an excess of male births although these were not statistically significant. The study proposed that incineratorreleases such as polychlorinated hydrocarbons, dioxins and pesticides, if present, might have affected the sex ratios. However, the authors noted that it is not possible to attribute causality of increased female births to materialsreleased by incinerators this study alone and proposed that more research was needed. 3.2.4 Congenital Abnormalities Research on populations living near to incinerators has reported an increased incidence of congenital abnormalities.One study in Amsterdam found increased numbers of orofacial clefts and other midline defects in a communityliving near to an incinerator site used for the open burningof chemicals. Another study near to an incinerator inBelgium found an increased prevalence of congenitalabnormalities. Other research on congenital eye malformations has not detected an increased prevalencenear to incinerators. Between 1961 and 1969, a poorly regulated incinerator carried out open-burning of waste chemicals in Zeeburg,Amsterdam. A recent analysis of data from the region hasrevealed a dramatic increase in the incidence of orofacialclefts in babies born after incineration began (ten Tusscher et al. 2000). In comparison, no increase in orofacial clefts during the same time period was observed in births fromanother area that was unaffected by the waste burning. For instance, the average incidence of orofacial clefts inZeeburg between 1961 and 1969 was 2.5 per 1000 birthscompared to 1.2 per 1000 births in the comparison area. In particular, for the years 1963 and 1964, the incidence ofcongenital abnormalities at Zeeburg was respectively 5.1and 7 .1 per 1000 births. This result for 1963/4 was statistically significantly different to the comparison area. The residential location of many of the women who gave birth to babies who had orofacial clefts was found to be situated in an area along a corridor of wind-flow from theincinerator. It is known that chemical exposure can be acause of orofacial clefts and it was noted that dioxin (TCDD)is known to cause cleft palate in mice. The authors concluded that although a cause-effect relationship cannotbe proven in this case, it seems very likely that there is alink between the open incineration of chemicals and theincreased incidence of orofacial clefts in Zeeburg ,Amsterdam for the years 1960 to 1969. Furthermore, aswell as orofacial clefts, the majority of babies born inZeeburg with some other midline defects were born in thearea corresponding to wind-flow from the incinerator. Theseconditions included central nervous system defects (mainlyspina bifida) and genital defects (mainly hypospadias). A cluster of congenital abnormalities was discovered among inhabitants of the Neerland neighbourhood in theWilrijk region, Belgium. This stirred up unrest in the localcommunity. The area is situated between two municipalINCINERATION AND HUMAN HEAL TH 33waste incinerators, one at a distance of 1200 meters and the other at a distance of 800 meters. Research had previously shown that the area around Wilrijk was amongthe regions in Flanders that received the highest dioxin deposition. This was due to the incineration of municipalwastes between 1980 and 1996. Following concern by residents about the cluster of congenital abnormalities, twohealth studies were ordered by the government and tookplace between 1997-1998. The first (Verschaeve andSchoeters 1998) investigated genetic damage in chromosomes in certain types of blood cells (peripherallymphocytes), and the second investigated children's health (Aelvo et al. 1998). Van Larebeke (2000) recently reviewed these studies. The first study, on chromosomal damage, compared 24 children from the area with a control group of 20 childrenfrom another neighbourhood in the Antwerp region. Thestudy did not detect any differences in chromosomal aberrations between the two groups. However, vanLarebeke (2000) commented that if genetic effects werepresent, they would be expected to be of low intensity. The study did not have the statistical sensitivity to be ableto detect such effects at low intensity. Therefore it is possible that such effects could be present but would not have been found by the study. If present, such geneticeffects could have a significant impact on health. The second study assessed health problems of children from Neerland. The study found an increased incidence of congenital malformations in babies from Neerland compared with incidence within Belgium as a whole,although the result was not statistically significant. Theprobability of giving birth to a baby with congenital malformation was 1.26 times greater for Neerland womenthan for Flemish women in general. There was also anincreased incidence in congenitally malformed babies bornin Neerland compared to babies who were born in thesame clinics but whose families resided elsewhere. Theincreased probability of having a congenitally malformedbaby appeared to be confined to children born to parentswho had not resided for a long time in Neerland. In addition to congenital abnormalities, the second study also investigated performance and health of children fromNeerland at school compared to other children from a nearby area and to Flemish children in general. No differences were apparent in failure at school. However,increased allergies and repeated episodes of the commoncold were significantly increased in Neerland children in thethird class of maternal school, and increased complaints onhealth in general were also more frequent. At the age of 9,in third class of primary school, there was a significant increase in allergies and \"use of medication\". Use of medication is considered to be an indirect measure of illhealth caused by pollution. Van Larebeke (2000) concluded in a review of the studies that a more detailed in-depth analysis of the health statusof children from the Neerland neighbourhood might revealother health effects possibly related to pollution. Forinstance, data on individual exposure determined as bloodlevels of dioxins were lacking in the study as were data onearly (pre-symptomatic) biological effects. The presentresults were considered to be sufficiently indicative to warrant further study to include investigation of thesepoints. Both incinerators were shut down in November1997 due to their exceeding the dioxin air emission standards and consequent considerations of public health (Nouwen et al. 1999). In a review of incineration and health, Gatrell and Lovett (1989) discuss findings on congenital eye malformations inchildren born in the vicinity of incinerators. At two chemicalwaste incinerators in Scotland, UK, (owned by ReChem),there were reports in national newspapers of congenital eyemalformations in children born near to the incinerators.However, government studies found no evidence ofincreased congenital eye malformations in children born inthe vicinity of these plants, or another Rechem chemicalwaste incinerator in Wales. The government studies have,however, been questioned on accuracy because the database of eye malformations that was used has a voluntary rather than obligatory notification system andtherefore some genuine cases may be missed out. Furtherresearch on this subject by Gatrell and Lovett (1989) investigated whether there was any evidence of clusteringof eye malformations around incinerator sites in areasacross England and Wales, but found no evidence of a link. Again, this study was limited by the database of registered congenital eye malformations. 3.2.5 Multiple Pregnancy There are inconsistent results reported in the scientific literature about a possible increase in multiple pregnanciesnear to incinerators. An initial study (Lloyd et al. 1988) investigated twinning rates around two chemical wasteincinerators in Scotland, UK, between 1976 and 1983, following anecdotal reports of increased twinning in cattlein the area. For the years 1980 to 1983, the study found thehighest values of twinning were apparent in the areas considered to be most vulnerable to incinerator releases.Values for 1980 were statistically significant. Comparativelyhigh values were also observed in areas designated as lessvulnerable in the period for 1976-9. Analysis of results indicated that the late 1970s and early 1980s was the period when spatial clustering of excess twinning became evident. INCINERATION AND HUMAN HEAL TH34During the late 1970s to the early 80's, the rate of twinning in cattle in the area was also seen to increase dramatically.Lloyd et al. (1988) proposed that the increased rate of twinning in cattle and in humans in the area was consistentwith the hypothesis that environmental air pollution mayhave affected obstetric parameters of the local populationsof people and animals. However, not all confounding factors could be ruled out and based on the results, theauthors commented that it would be premature to attributea causal link between the pollution from incinerators and twinning. In addition to increased twinning in cattle, farmers in the area had reported other effects in cattle including increasedabnormalities and stillbirths and unexpected deaths. A subsequent study, (Lenihan Inquiry Report) however did not find a link between the incinerator releases andproblems in the cattle (cited in Petts 1992, Gatrell and Lovett 1989). Van Larebeke (2000) noted that data from a Belgian study on incineration and health effects (discussed above, section 4.2.5), showed that there was a statisticallysignificant increased (2.6-fold) probability of having multiplepregnancies in a population living in the neighbourhood oftwo MSW incinerators. In another study however, data oftwin deliveries in Sweden between 1973 and 1990 did notshow evidence of clusters of twin births in the vicinity ofincinerators (Rydhstroem 1998). The study used a methodthat could compare the number of twin deliveries bothbefore and after the commissioning of an incinerator. 3.2.6 Hormonal Effects Thyroid hormones in the blood of children living in industrial/agricultural municipalities close to the Beibesheimincinerator in Germany were compared to those of childrenliving in an industrial/agricultural area without an incineratorand in a second comparison area (Osius & Karmaus, 1998).The incinerator was licenced to burn highly PCB contaminated materials (Osius et al. 1999). The initial 1998 study determined thyroid hormones- free thyroxine and free triiodothyronine-in blood samples from 67 1 children,aged 7-10 years. Blood serum levels of free thyroxine (FT4)and, to a lesser extent, free triiodothyronine (FT4) were statistically significantly lower in children living in the area in which the incinerator was operating. In this group, it wasalso found that there was a higher prevalence of FT3 valuesbelow clinical references. Mean levels of thyrotropin stimulating hormone (TSH), however, were only marginallydifferent. The authors concluded that their results, considered with those of Holdke et al. (1998), (see: Section 3.1.1), suggested that children exposed to toxic waste incineration in the studied area had lower free blood thyroid hormone levels.In the later 1999 study, the authors attempted to correlate blood contaminant levels with the highly complex thyroidhormone system, which regulates the development of brainfunction and cell growth. It was found that increased concentrations of the mon-ortho congener PCB 118 in the blood were statistically significantly associated withincreased levels of TSH. Elevated levels of PCB congeners138, 153, 180, 183 and 187 were associated with reducedblood FT3 levels. No associations were found for PCB congeners and FT4 although elevated blood cadmium concentrations were associated with raised TSH levels anddiminished FT4 levels. The authors concluded that thestudy supported the hypothesis that cadmium and PCBscould have a detrimental effect upon levels of thyroid hormones. Given the importance of the thyroid hormonesystem in the growth and development of children theauthors suggested that future studies should be made ofimpacts of these contaminants upon thyroid hormones indifferent age groups and to consider neurological development as a component of these studies. 3.3 Risk Assessment The present regulatory system aims to set quantities or rates at which chemicals can be legally released into theenvironment. In Europe, limits are generally based on theprocess of hazard assessment but in recent years theprocess of risk assessment has been increasingly implemented. A risk assessment on health effects attempts to estimate exposure to a particular chemical from the pollutant releases in question and finally calculates the probability of health effects from the estimated exposure. Many riskassessments have been reported on health effects expected to arise from exposure to incinerator releases, particularly cancer risk. Nearly all such risk assessmentsfrom the 1980s through to the 1990s have concluded thatcontmainants from incinerators do not pose a significanthealth risk to populations living within their vicinity. This is in direct contrast to human epidemiological studies, someof which have found evidence of health impacts. For example, a review of risk assessment data for hazardous waste incinerators in the 1980s by Oppelt (1990)points to a conclusion that stack emissions from burninghazardous waste pose little risk to human health. Data onwhich many of these assessment were based has howeverbeen criticised by the US EPA Science Advisory Board asbeing insufficient. Dempsey and Oppelt (1993) discuss riskassessments conducted for cement kilns burning hazardouswaste. These concluded that no adverse health effectswould be expected due to emissions. A US health riskassessment on MSW incinerator air emissions estimatedthat carcinogenic and non-carcinogenic risks from exposurevia inhalation were within acceptable limits (Roffman andINCINERATION AND HUMAN HEAL TH 35Roffman 1991). Similarly, a study in Germany estimated that cancer risk caused by inhalation of selected heavy metalsand dioxins emitted from modern municipal waste incinerators would not endanger health. (Eikman 1994). A study on a MSW incinerator in Mokdong, Seoul, Korea,also reported that cancer risk from inhalation was less thanthe acceptable risk value of one cancer case in a million(Lee et al. 1997). One of the criticisms of many health risk assessments on incinerators is that they only account for exposure viainhalation and do not consider other routes of potentialexposure such as ingestion of soil and vegetation andabsorption through the skin (Webster and Connett 1990).This criticism applies to many of the above mentioned studies. Given that ingestion of food is the dominant routeof exposure for incinerators sited in or near to agriculturalareas this brings all the above risk assessments into substantial question (see e.g. Meneses et al. 1999, Webster and Connett 1990). A recent risk assessment of a MSW incinerator in Montcada, Catalonia, Spain, did take into account all of the known potential exposure routes for dioxins. The riskassessment estimated exposure of local residents to incinerator air emissions of dioxins via inhalation of air andparticulate matter, and via soil and vegetable intake fromthe area and via absorption of soil through the skin(Meneses et al. 1999). It compared the intake of dioxins through these routes with intake through a normal diet.Results showed that incinerator air emissions accounted forless than 6% of the total dioxin intake for the population,while diet accounted for greater than 94%. The study concluded that according to the WHO standard for tolerabledaily intake (TDI) of dioxins, (i.e. the daily intake of dioxinsper person proposed as safe based on current knowledge),intake of dioxins from the incinerator would not imply healthrisks for the general population of the area. However, thestudy failed to mention that the incinerator emissions wouldnevertheless add to levels of dioxins already stored in thetissues of the nearby population as well as those alreadypresent in the food supply.. Interestingly, a recent risk assessment was published which did indicate an increased health risk from exposureto dioxins for some child members of a population livingnear to incinerators (Nouwen et al. 1999). The risk assessment was conducted for the population living within the vicinity of the two incinerators in Neerland,Wilrijk, Belgium. Epidemiological studies in this region indicated that an increased probability of congenital malformations at birth and some impacts on respiratoryhealth of children as discussed in section 4.2.5 above (vanLarebeke 2000). The risk assessment considered 3 possibleexposure scenarios. These were, firstly, a worst case scenario in which individuals lived exclusively from foods (meat, milk and vegetables) produced in the vicinity of theincinerator. Secondly, a scenario which assumed peopleconsumed a mixture of commercial produce and producefrom the area (25% crops and 50% meat) was considered.Thirdly, a scenario was proposed in which individuals consumed only commercial produce containing backgroundconcentrations of dioxins. This latter scenario was assumedto be the exposure situation for the majority of the residentsat Neerland. Exposures were estimated based on dietaryexposure, inhalation and dermal exposure. The present tolerable daily intake set by WHO for dioxins is 1-4 pgTEQ/kg bw/day. The risk assessment estimated that children in the first, high exposure scenario, would haveexceeded this limit in 1980 by a factor in excess of 4 (16.62pg TEQ/kg bw/day). Children with an estimated mediumexposure in the second scenario, also exceeded the WHOTDI in 1997 by a 2-fold margin (8.1 7 pg TEQ/kg bw /day).The study considered that this would be the situation for arelatively few families. INCINERATION AND HUMAN HEAL TH364. ENVIRONMENTAL CONTAMINATIONINCINERATION AND HUMAN HEAL TH 374.1 Deliberate and Fugitive Releases from Incinerators. Incinerator wastes in the form of stack gas, fly ash, bottom ash/slag, scrubber water, scrubber water filter cake, etc. aredeliberately dispersed or otherwise released to the environment, carrying with them the diversity of pollutantsformed or redistributed during the incineration process.Some of the incinerator wastes as well as the wastes actually burned are also released unintentionally as fugitive emissions. One important difference between the two types of releases, deliberate and fugitive emissions, is the extent towhich they are subject to regulatory oversight and control.Thus far, stack gas would appear to be the most highly regulated of the deliberate releases from incinerators.Characterisation and oversight of the other deliberatelyreleased incinerator wastes is sparse at best. Fugitive emissions are vapours or particles that escape during waste tipping, waste feeding, incineration, and ashhandling. For example, fugitive dusts can be released frombottom-ash pits and fly-ash hoppers as well as during theprocess of transferring these ashes to transport vehiclesand during the transfer from transport vehicles to the finalrepositories, such as a landfill. These dusts, particularly flyash dusts from particulate air pollution control devices, areenriched in toxic metals and contain condensed organicmatter (NRC 2000). At hazardous waste incineration facilities, fugitive emissions are, in the case of liquid wastes, released as vapours fromliquid waste tank vents, pump seals, and valves. For solidwastes, fugitive emissions escape as dust from solid-materials handling and during the handling and transport of fly ash captured by air pollution control devices.Also, the high-temperature seals on rotary-kiln incineratorsare a potential source of vapour and dust emissions generated by such incineration facilities (NRC 2000). Fugitive emissions can be minimised by designing buildings to be under negative pressure so that air is drawn from theareas where both the incinerator ashes and the wastes tobe burned are handled and stored. The National ResourceCouncil noted, \"Although some facilities have partially closed ash-removal systems, few have completely enclosed ash-handling systems throughout the plant\" Fugitive emissions that are released near ground level may well have a greater impact on the nearby environment thanthose released into the air from the incinerator stack. Thepattern of dispersal of both fugitive emissions and stackreleases depends on a potentially infinite number of variables, for example, type of terrain, presence of nearbystructures or trees, wind direction and velocity, weatherconditions and relative humidity and the interactionsbetween them. 4.2 Studies on Environmental Contamination Pollutants that are emitted into the atmosphere from an incinerator stack, as well as fugitive emissions, may bedeposited on the ground near to the incinerator and socontaminate the local environment. Some pollutants, including PM10 particulate matter and volatile and semivolatile organic compounds, such as dioxins and PCBs,may also be transported great distances on air currents. For example, Lorber et al. (1998) estimated that only around 2% of the dioxin emissions to air are deposited in soil near to an incinerator while the remainder is much morewidely dispersed. Most research on environmental contamination in the vicinity of incinerators has focused on dioxins and heavymetals, ignoring most other pollutants. Studies show thatsoil and vegetation close to incinerators may become contaminated with incinerator releases of dioxins and heavymetals to levels above normal background concentrations.As a consequence, there is a possibility of agricultural produce, such as crops, becoming contaminated. Livestockmay also take in pollutants, largely through ingestion ofcontaminated vegetation and soil. In some instances thishas led to cow's milk being banned from sale due to unacceptably high levels of dioxins, and recommendationsto avoid the consumption of eggs and poultry. This section discusses studies on levels of dioxins and heavy metals found in soil and vegetation in the vicinity of incinerators, both in the past, and more recently. Levelsfound in cow's milk are also discussed. Considering thepotential for contamination of agricultural produce close to incinerators of all types, the research in this area is very limited. 4.2.1 Soil and Vegetation Research has shown that soil and vegetation can be used as suitable media for monitoring contamination from atmos-pheric deposition of dioxins and heavy metals (seeSchuhmacher et al. 1999a, Schuhmacher et al. (1997a), Gutenman et al. (1992). Levels of dioxins in soils have been widely used to describe long-term exposure to these chemicals. On the other hand,vegetation is a more representative index of short-termexposure to dioxins (Schuhmacher et al. 1999b).INCINERATION AND HUMAN HEAL TH38With regard to vegetation, dioxins and heavy metals may simply be deposited on the surface of leaves or be presentin soil particles on the plants. In addition, metals may enterthe leaves through the small pores on the leaf surfaces(stomata) and be taken up by the roots in woody plants(see Bache et al. 1992). Dioxins are, however, apparently not taken up by the root system of plants (Hulster andMarschner 1992). Dioxins There are many sources of dioxins in urban areas besides incinerators and consequently, in urban/industrial areas, it isdifficult to clarify whether dioxin contamination is comingfrom an incinerator as opposed to other sources.Nevertheless, studies have shown that high levels of dioxinsare present in soils near to some incinerators. In manyinstances, they have also shown that the level of dioxinfound in soil and vegetation is dependent upon the distancefrom the incinerator, a phenomenon which implicates incinerators as a primary source of the contamination. For instance, a study which took soil samples from the surroundings of a clinical waste incinerator in Spain, foundthe highest levels were located at distances nearer to theincinerator compared to further away (Jimenez et al. 1996). Levels in soils close to the incinerator were 2.1 to 7.5 timeshigher than usual background levels of dioxins in soils. Inanother study, extremely high dioxin levels (e.g. 252 and211 ppt TEQ ) were found in soils on the leeward side of aJapanese MSW incinerator (Ohta et al. 1997). These levels are exceedingly high compared to background levels foundin soils of industrialised countries (e.g. 3.6 ppt TEQ for ruralsoils and 11.9 ppt TEQ for urban soils of North America,and similar levels for Europe), (USEPA 2000). This incinerator has generated considerable controversy due tothe high number of cancer deaths recorded nearby. Thestudy showed that the high soil levels correlated with thearea of high cancer incidence. In 1993, exceptionally high levels of dioxins and PCBs were reported in soils near to the Shanks hazardous wasteincinerator (formerly the Rechem incinerator) in Wales, UK(see ENDS 2000b). The highest level of dioxins was 1 740ng I-TEQ/kg (Foxall and Lovett 1994). The study indicatedthat releases other than those from the incinerator stackcould have been substantially responsible for the high levels, including fugitive emissions during ash disposaloperations from waste storage areas and the transformerhandling facility (Foxall and Lovett 1994). The plant hassince been upgraded and recent data suggest that levels of dioxins in soils have now fallen to around two-thirds ofthe 1993 values. The decline in PCBs is however less marked. Moreover, average air emissions of PCBs (2 ng/m 3) from the plant are well above levels in urban areas of Britain which rarely exceed 1ng/m3and are usually well below 0.5ng/m3. Even so, despite being previously challenged by the Environment Agency, the company now has authorisation to import another 200 transformercarcasses, a known source of PCBs, from Italy (ENDS2000b). A 1998 study on an old MSW incinerator in Montcada, Barcelona, reported dioxin levels in soils ranging from 0.06to (ppt), (Granero et al. 1999). The study found that levels had increased at all sites that were monitored between 1996 and 1997 and again between1997 and 1998. However, the increases were not statistically significant. The authors noted that although theconditions of incineration remained constant during 1996 to 1998, it is possible that the potential accumulation ofdioxins in soils that may be expected from incinerationcould be counteracted by a decrease in emissions fromother sources in the area. Some studies have shown that incineration is not always associated with high levels of dioxins in local soils. Forinstance, a study in Spain showed that levels in the vicinityof an old incinerator in Catalonia in 1997 (range 0.11 to3.88 mean 1.1 7 ng I-TEQ/kg (ppt) were not unduly high and indeed were consistent with levels found at MSWincinerator sites in other studies in the US and TheNetherlands (Schuhmacher et al. 1999a). The levels found in 1997 had, however, increased slightly (8.3%), but notsignificantly, from levels previously determined in 1996. Studies on vegetation near a MSW incinerator in Catalonia, Spain in 1996/7 showed that the incinerator contributed todioxins in vegetation because higher levels were apparentclosest to the incinerator with lower levels recorded furtheraway (Domingo et al. 1998). However, between 1996 and 1997, unlike levels in soils at the incinerator which remainedrelatively constant, (see above: Schuhmacher et al. 1999a), in some areas there was a reduction in the levels of dioxinsin vegetation. Since vegetation largely reflects short-termchanges in dioxin exposure, whereas soil reflects longer-term exposure, the study noted that the reduction in dioxin levels in vegetation might be due to better pollution control at the incinerator. It could also, however,be reflective of a reduction of dioxin emissions from othersources in the area in general. Similarly, another study inSpain at an old MSW incinerator in Montcarda, Barcelona,found a decrease in levels of dioxin between 1997 and1998. The study proposed that the reduction in dioxin levelswas probably due to general abatement actions to reducedioxin air emissions (Schuhmacher et al. 1999b). Heavy Metals Heavy metals released into the environment from incinerators can contaminate soils and build up INCINERATION AND HUMAN HEAL TH 39(bioaccumulate) in plants and animals. In this way they eventually make their way to humans via the food chain orthrough contamination of drinking water. In addition, forpeople living in the vicinity of incinerators, and especially for children, exposure to heavy metals may also occur due to the consumption of dirt or dust originating from contaminated soil. Other routes of heavy metal intakeinclude inhalation and absorption via the skin (Schuhmacher et al. 1997b). Data on levels of heavy metals in soils near to incinerators are very limited. A study on soils near to an industrial incinerator in Italy found lead pollution in soils wasincreased by some 600% (Zanini and Bonifacio 1991). Amore recent investigation into levels of cadmium and leadin soils surrounding the Baldovie MSW incinerator inScotland determined that the incinerator was responsiblefor the long-term distribution of the metals in soils within a 5 km vicinity of the incinerator (Collett et al. 1998). It was found that long-term concentrations of cadmium and lead in emissions to air from the incinerator were related tolevels found in local soils. Although the levels of cadmiumand lead were linked to incinerator air emissions, the studyalso reported that levels of cadmium and lead were withintheir normal background ranges in soils. A study on asewage sludge incinerator near to Birmingham, UK, foundevidence of lead and cadmium contamination in surfacedusts close to the incinerator (Feng and Barratt 1999). A recent study in Spain on the old MSW incinerator in Montcada, Barcelona did not find levels of heavy metalsthat were considered to be high (Schuhmacher et al. 1997b). For cadmium and lead, levels were similar to concentrations reported for uncontaminated soils. There are only a few studies in the scientific literature on levels of heavy metals in vegetation in the vicinity ofincinerators. Bache et al. (1991) reported contamination of vegetation surrounding a MSW incinerator (without airemission controls) in the US by several heavy metals.Another study on a MSW incinerator in the US, this timefitted with pollution control equipment, found that levels of cadmium and lead in tree foliage were linked to distancefrom the incinerator (Bache et al. 1992). The study concluded that even a MSW incinerator with pollution control equipment (electrostatic precipitator) could result inthe significant deposition of metals such as cadmium andlead in surrounding areas. A study on a MSW incinerator inNew Jersey reported that levels of mercury in vegetation(moss placed at specific sites around the incinerator) wasrelated to distance from the incinerator (Carpi andWeinstein 1994). The highest concentrations of mercurywere located closest to the incinerator. One study has been documented in the scientific literature, which did not find a link between incineration and heavymetals in surrounding vegetation. The study reported thatcontamination of vegetation with cadmium and lead wasnot apparently related to distance from a MSW incinerator(Gutenman et al. 1992). 4.2.2 Cow's Milk Cattle that graze in areas subject to air deposition of pollutants, such as dioxins, can ingest the pollutants thathave been deposited on vegetation and soils. Dioxins cansubsequently be passed to their milk, and hence, ultimatelyto humans. This is because elimination via milk is a majorroute of excretion of dioxins in cow's (Baldassarri et al. 1994). Research conducted in several countries during the 1990's has demonstrated elevated levels of dioxins in cow'smilk from farms located near to incinerators. A decade ago, a study in the Netherlands reported high concentrations of dioxins in cow's milk (up to 13.5 pgI-TEQ/g fat [ppt]). This led to a decision by the Dutch government to instigate an upper limit for dioxin levels inmilk and milk products of 6 pg I-TEQ/g (fat), (Liem et al. 1990). Some other European countries including Germany, Holland and Austria (Ramos et al. 1997) later also adopted this limit-value. A study in Austria reported high dioxin levelsin cow's milk obtained from farms sited close to incinerators (up to 8.6 pg I-TEQ/g fat), (MAFF 1997a). Inthe UK, exceptionally high levels of dioxins (up to 1.9 pgTEQ/g whole milk, equivalent to 48 pg TEQ/g fat) werereported in milk from farms located near to a chemicalwaste incinerator at the Coalite chemicals plant inDerbyshire (MAFF 1992, EA 1997, Sandells et al. 1997). The incinerator was subsequently closed down inNovember 1991. More recent studies have also found evidence of increased levels of dioxins in cow's milk from farms situated near toincinerators. For instance, a UK study on milk from farmslocated within the vicinity of potential dioxin sources in the UK, found that farms near to two out of eight MSWincinerator sites investigated had milk with levels of dioxinswhich exceeded the Dutch 6 pg I-TEQ/g fat limit in 1993-5(MAFF 1997b). In 1995, milk from a farm sited near aMSW incinerator in Bristol had a level of 6.1 pg TEQ/g fatwhilst milk from farms near to an incinerator in WestYorkshire had levels ranging from 3.1 to 11 pg I-TEQ/g fat.A retest in of farms in the latter area in 1996 showed thathigh levels remained in milk (1.9-8.6 pg I-TEQ/g fat). Theincinerator was closed later in the year for failing to meetnewly imposed pollution control standards. A study in Switzerland of cow's milk from farms located in both rural and more industrial areas reported that local influence of incinerators on dioxin levels in milk was clearlyINCINERATION AND HUMAN HEAL TH40detectable (Schmid and Schlatter 1992). Similarly, a more recent study in Spain found that milk from rural areas hadlevels of dioxins (1.3-2.47 pg I-TEQ/g fat) that were lowerthan levels in milk from a farm located in the vicinity ofpotential dioxin sources. Of the dioxin sources, it was determined that a waste incinerator had the greatest effect such that the highest levels (3.32 pg I-TEQ/g fat) inmilk were obtained for a farm situated close by (Ramos et al. 1997). INCINERATION AND HUMAN HEAL TH 415. INCINERATOR RELEASESINCINERATION AND HUMAN HEAL TH42All waste incinerators are also waste generators - incineration of waste results in output of waste products.This is because physical matter cannot actually bedestroyed, but can only be transformed into new forms.Thus when things are burned, they do not disappear as isthe common perception, but merely change their form.Waste products resulting from incineration take the form of stack gas emissions to the atmosphere, bottom ashes(slag) and fly ashes (caught in filters in the incineratorstack) which ultimately are disposed of to landfill sites.Where water is used for cleaning processes in an incinerator, there are also releases of waste products to water. It is a popular misconception that the weight and volume of the original raw waste are reduced during incineration.Although it is often stated that the solid residues (ashes)remaining equate to about one third of the initial weight of the raw waste (Pluss and Ferrell 1991), and volumereduction of about 90% is achieved (Williams 1990) neitherof these statistics stand up to scrutiny. If all the waste outputs from an incinerator are summed, then the outputwill exceed the original waste input. The gases present inthe flue stack result from the combination of carbon-basedmaterials with oxygen and are usually ignored in calculatingthe mass of residues, but the combination with oxygen toform CO2 increases actual weight. Residues from wet gascleaning systems can generate appreciable volumes of contaminated water and solids. In the case of the statisticconcerning volume reduction, this is usually generated byreference to the volume of uncompacted wastes. LandfilledMSW, however, is generally compacted to increase stabilityand prevent water infiltration as well as reduce the volumeof the wastes. Comparing unburned waste and incineratorash, the actual volume reduction achievable is closer to 45% (DoE 1995). Numerous chemicals are released into the wastes generated by incineration, including hazardous chemicals.For instance, MSW incinerators are typically fed a mixedwaste stream and the combustion of such waste leads tohazardous substances originally present within the wastebeing mobilised into releases from the incineration plant.While some chemicals remain in their original form, othersare changed into new chemical species. For example,heavy metals are not destroyed by incineration but are simply concentrated in the remaining wastes. They canremain in their original form during incineration or may reactto form new compounds such as metal oxides, chlorides or fluorides (Dempsey and Oppelt 1993). The exact nature of the substances released during incineration depends on the composition of the waste thatis incinerated. For instance, incineration of chlorinatedorganic compounds will cause the formation of hydrogenchloride (HCl) and this in turn can contribute to the formation of dioxins. Technical standards that are appliedboth to the incineration process and to pollution controlequipment will also influence the final products of incineration (EEA 2000). However, whatever control technology is applied, all types of incineration result inreleases of toxic substances in ashes and in the form ofgases/particulate matter to air. These substances includeheavy metals, numerous organic compounds, such as dioxins, and gases, such as nitrogen oxides, sulphur oxides,hydrogen chloride, hydrogen fluoride, together with carbon dioxide. According to the NRC (2000): \" ... the products of primary concern, owing to their potential effects on human health and the environment, arecompounds that contain sulfur, nitrogen, halogens (suchas chlorine), and toxic metals. Specific compounds of concern include CO, NO x, SOx, HCl, cadmium, lead, mercury, chromium, arsenic, beryllium, dioxins and furans, PCBs, and polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons. ...\" In many countries over the past few years, new regulatory air emission standards have forced the closure or updatingof many old incinerators or the building of new ones.Upgraded plants (together with new ones) may be fittedwith modern, improved air pollution control technology. Forexample, out of the 780 incinerators in operation in the UKin the early 1990s (30 for municipal waste, 700 for clinicalwaste, 40 attached to chemical companies, 6 for sewagesludge and 4 for hazardous waste), only 110 remained afterthe tightening of standards (Murray 1999). Presently thereare 12 MSW operating incinerators in the UK. The closureor updating of old incinerators is considered to have led toa substantial reduction of emissions of toxic substances to air. One study in the Netherlands has also estimated that dioxin emissions to air have been significantly reduced (Born1996). Murray (1999) states that the most sophisticatedGerman technology developed during the early 1990's hascut atmospheric emissions broadly by a factor of ten.Although this is a significant improvement, the problem oftoxic waste products from incineration has not disappeared.In fact, the problem has shifted so that more of the dioxinsand other toxic substances generated now appear in the ashes, thereby creating new disposal and pollutionproblems. The European Environment Agency (EEA 2000)has warned that even if total air emissions from incinerationare reduced in the future as standards improve \"this mightbe offset with increased incineration capacity\". In thisregard, it is of great concern that an increase in the use ofincineration is being proposed in some European countries.In the UK for instance, following the closure of numerousold incinerators, up to 1 77 possible new ones have beenproposed by the government (ENDS 1999).INCINERATION AND HUMAN HEAL TH 43On the regulatory front, among the various incinerator outputs, stack gas has received the greatest share of attention and is the most highly regulated since the gas andits toxic components are dispersed directly into the openair. However, the other incinerator wastes also contain toxicpollutants and, consequently, pose threats to public healththat may be less obvious and/or immediate but are no less real. The Commission of the European Communities (CEC) has been drafting a proposal for a new waste incineration directive since 1998 (EC 1998, EC 1999). The proposednew directive will establish controls on the incineration ofmost wastes that are not covered by the previous 1994directive. The new directive will set limits for releases ofsome hazardous substances in stack gases and water. Thedirective is expected to be adopted by the end of 2000 or early 2001. All new MSW incinerators built after thedirective comes into force must satisfy the limits in thedirective within 2 years, whilst existing incinerators have aperiod of 5 years to satisfy the criteria. In addition to the EU regulations, various national guidelines for incineratorsare also presently in place and these will have to complywith the directive within two years of it coming into force (EC 1999). 5.1 Releases to Air This section presents data on substances known to emitted in stack gases from incinerators. Most research on air emissions has focused on dioxins and upon the behaviourof a few toxic heavy metals. Data from research upon otheremitted chemicals are sparse. In addition, a very large number of the chemicals emitted from incinerators remain unidentified. Emissions from incinerator stacks to air are discussed below under the following categories: organic compounds;heavy metals; gases and particulates. The EC have proposed limits for air emissions from incinerators in theirnew directive for only a few of the compounds falling under these categories. These proposed limits are given in the table below.Table 5.1 EC Air Emission Limit Values aAverage values measured over a sample period of a minimum of 6 hours and a maximum of 8 hours. b All average values over the sample period of a minimum of 30 minutes and a maximum of 8 hours. cDaily average value 5.1.1 Organic Compounds Dioxins Polychlorinated dibenzo- and polychlorinated dibenzofurans (PCDFs) are a group ofchemicals often referred to simply as dioxins. There aremore than 200 individual congeners (members) of thePCDD/Fs group. The most widely known and most toxiccongener is 2,3,7,8-TCDD. It has been described as themost toxic chemical known to mankind and is a recognisedas a human carcinogen. Dioxins are persistent in the environment, toxic and bioaccumulative (build up in the tissues of living organisms). A more detailed description of the toxic impacts of dioxins on health is given in appendix A. The toxicity of individual dioxins and furans varies by several orders of magnitude. Because analytical data may report 1 7different congeners as well as totals for homologue groups(i.e. all congeners containing the same number of chlorineatoms), it is often necessary to summarise data so that indi-vidual samples can be directly compared. This is generallydone by expressing the amount of dioxins present as toxicequivalents (TEQs) relative to 2,3,7,8-TCDD. The most com-mon TEQ system used is the international toxic equivalentssystem (I-TEQ). The TEQ system works by assigning TCDD, the most toxic congener, a toxic equivalence factor (TEF) value of 1. The toxicity of all othercongeners is expressed relative to this, such that they are assigned a TEF value between 0 and 1. The I-TEQ of a sample containing a mixture of dioxins is obtained by multiplying the concentration of each congener by itsTEF and summing the results. Substance Proposed EC Limit (mg/Nm3) Dioxins MercuryCadmium + ThalliumSb, As, TH44One important consideration in relation to dioxin air emissions from incinerators is that regulations consider onlythe chlorinated varieties. It has been known for some timethat incinerators generate and emit brominated and mixedchloro-bromo substituted dioxins in appreciable quantities(see: Schwind et al. 1988). These are regarded as of an equal toxicological significance relative to the chlorinateddioxins, producing a similar array of biological impacts atsimilar molar concentrations (Weber and Greim 1997).Despite these compounds being highly persistent whenassociated with fly ash particles, little attention has beendirected at evaluation of their significance to human healthand there are currently no obligations on the part of incinerator operators to monitor and control these chemicals. Formation of Dioxins in Incinerators Dioxins are produced as unintentional by-products of many manufacturing and combustion processes, especiallyprocesses that use, produce or dispose of chlorine or chlorine derived chemicals. All types of incinerators producethem. Research has shown that while dioxins can bedestroyed in the combustion zone of incinerators, they canbe regenerated in the post-combustion zone by processesthat are dependent on the temperature profile (Blumenstock et al. 2000, Huang and Buekens 1995, Fangmark et al. 1994). The predominant formation pathway of dioxins has been reported to be de novo synthesis (Johnke andStelzner 1992), and they are also formed from precursorsthat are either constituents of the waste or are also formedby chemical recombination of materials in the waste. Thechlorobenzenes and chlorophenols are two such groups(Huang and Buekens 1995). PVC, a common constituent in municipal waste, has also been identified as a dioxin precursor (USEPA 1997). Prior to incineration, raw waste is itself known to contain dioxins. However, it has been demonstrated that theprocess of waste incineration creates dioxins. For instance,past and present, calculations (mass balances) both show that the total amount of dioxins coming out of anincinerator in the various waste products is greater than the amount going into the incinerator as raw waste(Williams 1990; Hansen 2000). This appears to still be thecase for modern and updated incinerators operating in thelate 1990s, although very little in the way of scientific datais available from the scientific literature with the exceptionof a recent Danish study (Hansen 2000). In another example from Spain, a mass balance estimate based on measurements from eight operating municipalwaste incinerators showed that more dioxins are emittedfrom the incinerators than were present in the raw waste(Fabrellas et al. 1999). Estimates showed the level of dioxins (PCDD/Fs) input in raw waste to the incineratoramounted to 79.8 g I-TEQ/year. This compared to the total estimated output of flue gases (1-1.2 g I-TEQ/year), flyashes (46.6-111.6 gI-TEQ/year). An alternative dioxin mass balance conductedon another Spanish municipal waste incinerator wasambiguous. One test showed a greater dioxin output thaninput whereas another test showed a greater dioxin inputthan output (Abad et al. 2000). This is not particularly surprising because emissions of dioxins and other substances from individual incinerators are highly variabledepending on waste input and combustion conditions. In addition, the precision of such estimates is often nothigh, encompassing a wide range of values. Dioxin Inventories and Incineration During the 1980s and early to mid-1990s MSW incineration, in particular, was identified as a major sourceof dioxins emitted to atmosphere. For example, the Dutchgovernment organisation RIVM estimated that incinerationwas responsible for about 79% of all dioxins emitted to airin the Netherlands for the year 1991. In the UK, MSW incinerators were estimated as responsible for about 53-82% of all dioxins emitted to air in 1995. In the US such facilities accounted for about 37% of total annual airemissions (see Pastorelli et al. 1999). A summary of data from 15 countries, described as a \"global\" inventory,showed that incineration accounted for about 50% of dioxin emissions to air in 1995 (Fiedler 1999). MSW incineration has been identified as being responsible for the greatest proportion of dioxin air emissions compared toother types of incineration (eg. Alcock et al. 1998), although from \"global\" inventory data for 15 countries, Fiedler (1999)noted that all sectors of incineration in 1995 were major emitters in many countries. This included MSW incinerators, hazardous waste incinerators, sewage sludgeincinerators, waste wood incineration and crematoria. Table1.2 shows the estimated dioxin air emissions for differenttypes of incinerators for 1997 in the UK. Even recently, incinerators have been estimated to account for a high proportion of atmospheric dioxins. For example,(Hansen 2000), has conducted a flow analysis for dioxins inDenmark for 1998-1999. Notwithstanding improvements in technology, municipal solid waste incineration was identified as the single largest source of dioxin releases toatmosphere, estimated at between 11-42g I-TEQ per year. It is estimated that a further 35-275g I-TEQ of dioxins contained in incinerator residues is disposed of to landfilleach year. This report also draws attention to the potentialimportance of the brominated and mixed halogenated dioxins (Section 5. 1.1) and estimates that between 2 and 60g of brominated dioxins are emitted to atmosphere fromDanish MSW incinerators per year. INCINERATION AND HUMAN HEAL TH 45A 1997 publication cited by the commission of the European Communities (EC 1998) noted that incineration of non-hazardous waste may contribute up to 40% of alldioxin air emissions in Europe. Nevertheless, in someEuropean countries, it has been estimated that the contribution of MSW incineration to national inventories hasfallen significantly during the mid- to late 1990s. This is due to closure of old incinerators, which emitted high levelsof dioxins to air and the fitting of pollution abatementequipment to both remaining plant and new installations.Estimates suggest that such improvements will have resulted in the significant reduction of dioxin emissions fromincinerators to air. For instance, strong downward trends ofair emissions have been identified in countries with moderntechnology or rigid legislation (Fiedler 1999). Consideringatmospheric emissions alone, in the UK, Her Majesty'sInspectorate of Pollution (HMIP) and the Department of theEnvironment (DoE) estimated that the contribution to thetotal annual emission would fall from 53-82% in 1995, toaround 4-14% in the future. Similarly, the German UBA estimated a contribution of 33% for the years 1989-1990falling to 3% for the years 1999-2000. These estimateddata remain to be confirmed with empirically derived data. The need for confirmation is important. It has been acknowledged, for instance, in the above UK HMIP study, that there are large uncertainties in estimations ofincinerator air emissions used in dioxin inventories. In thecase of the UK study, this is because air emissions have generally been estimated from only very limited measurements and have also used information derived from non-UK studies. A recent UK study which correctedfor these sources of uncertainty to some extent (Alcock et al.1998), used a different, more precise, estimation method that included measured emission data from individual incinerators between 1995 and 1997 (see table 1.2). It currently represents the most comprehensive survey ofmeasured UK dioxin air emission data. Importantly, thestudy also used data from waste incinerators, which were operating under normal everyday conditions during the periods of testing. This is more realistic than measurementsbeing taken under \"optimum\" conditions that are specifically set up for testing under a \"test burn\" regimenwhich is, more often than not, the case. The study foundthat relative to emission data published by the HMIP for1995, the levels of dioxin emissions from MSW incineratorsbetween 1995-7 had fallen somewhat. Even so, they stillrepresented a significant part of the national inventory, representing 30 to 56% of the total national air dioxin emissions. Clearly the optimistic projections of the regulatory authorities need confirmation before they can be accepted as a realistic projection of trends or as a metric of the current situation. On the same note, Webster and Connett (1998) draw attention to uncertainties and problems in the methodologycommonly employed to derive national dioxin air emissioninventory data. These include several points listed belowand include two points specifically mentioned in the UKstudy above: firstly that few empirically measured data fromindividual incinerators are normally used in the estimate(see first bullet point), and that data on air emissions usedare most often derived from testing of incinerators under\"optimum\" conditions rather than normal day to day operations. Methodology: The method normally applied for estimating dioxin inventories, \"the emission factor approach\" relies on a limited number of specific measurements from particular types of incinerators and extrapolates these to represent all incinerators of a particular type. This is likely to underestimate emissions to all media. It does not take account of the fact that there can be enormous variability in emissions from individual incinerators of the same type.

Footnote: The estimate for total dioxin air emissions from all sources is Range/Low 219 and Range/High 663 g TEQ/annum.INCINERATION AND HUMAN HEAL TH46Webster and Connett (1998) showed that the \"emission factor approach\" did indeed underestimate dioxin air emissions from incinerators reported in many previous US inventories over the past decade. Instead of applyingthe emission factor approach, Webster and Connett (1998) summed dioxin air emissions for measured facilities only - an approach that would presumably underestimate these emissions since unmonitored incinerators were not included in the calculations. Even so, this method still produced a significantly greater value for MSW incinerator dioxin emissions to air than using the emission factor approach. The authors therefore stressed the need for adopting the use of actual measurements from individual facilities for inventories. Lack of Data: On a global basis, Fiedler (1999) reported that the present number of national dioxin emission inventories is very small. Within countries that have recorded dioxin inventories, there is a general lack of comprehensive data on dioxin air emissions from incinerators. For instance, Webster and Connett (1998) identified a paucity of data in the US with specific regard to emissions from incinerators. Many US MSW incinerators had either been tested only once or had never been tested at all. Although this situation appears to be improving, operators and regulators in the past seemed quite happy to deem a plant's emissions to atmosphere acceptable based on one set of measurements derived from a pre-commissioning test-burn. Even now, the frequency and intensity of stack sampling and analysis for dioxins carried out at most incinerators is unacceptably low. Monitoring: Research has shown that taking only a limited number of measurements is not likely to accurately reflect dioxin emissions to atmosphere from incinerators over the full spectrum of operational conditions. That dioxin emissions from combustion sources may change considerably over time is well illustrated by an UK study (Alcock et al. 1998). The study showed that air emissions indexed by samples collected from a cement kiln stack on the same day were found to vary considerably. The first sample collected measured 4.2ng I-TEQ m- 3and the second sample taken 5 hours later was determined as 0.06ng I-TEQ m-3. A more accurate estimate of atmospheric dioxin emissions can only be established by continuous monitoring of emissions for extended periods of time. Start-up and shutdown periods in the operation of MSW incinerators are particularly prone to result in high dioxin emissions. A studyon a Belgian incinerator, using continuous monitoring, wasundertaken in an attempt to demonstrate that retro-fittedmodern pollution control equipment would prevent excedence of the 0.1 TEQ/Nm 3regulatory limit at all times. In fact the results revealed that monitoring over a period of6 hours gave an average emission concentration of 0.25 ng TEQ/Nm 3. However, the average over 2 weeks in the same period gave a result of 8.2 to 12.9 ng TEQ/Nm3which was substantially greater and clearly exceeded the regulatory limit (De Fre and Wevers 1998). The above study shows, in a convincing manner, that taking measurements from individual incinerators under the normal regulatory protocols (i.e. point measurements),can significantly under-estimate the dioxin emissions to air from incinerators. In this case, point measurement under-estimated the average dioxin emissions by a factor of 30 to 50. The significance of this finding to other incineration facilities is simply not known. Dioxins in ash are not considered: Most mass balance inventories consider only dioxin emissions to atmosphere (Fiedler 1999); The output of dioxins in ash from incinerators is not included and Webster and Connett (1998) consider that the fate of dioxin captured in ash receives insufficient attention. A recent study on aSpanish incinerator showed that stack gas emissions were only responsible for a minor contribution to the total dioxin emitted compared to amounts present in fly ash (Abad et al. 2000). The fact that dioxins formed in incineration have become more concentrated in ashes as air pollution control technologies have evolved, thereby generating other hazards, is further discussed insection 5.3.1. Considered together, the generally flawed sampling methodology employed in regulating releases from incinerators coupled with failure to consider the dioxin mass balance in an holistic manner suggests that it is highly probable that most, if not all, dioxin inventories greatly underestimate releases from incinerators. Performance of Updated and New Incinerators As indicated above, most monitoring of atmospheric dioxin releases carried out at incinerators in Europe and reportedin the scientific literature has been derived on the basis ofpoint measurements rather than continuous monitoring.This can lead to an underestimate of air emissions. This situation seems set to continue under the proposed EC legislation which specifies compliance monitoring basedonly two point measurements per year taken over a periodof six to eight hours (EC 1999). This basis for regulation andcontrol, as opposed to continual monitoring is unlikely to accurately describe dioxin emissions to air from these facilities.INCINERATION AND HUMAN HEAL TH 47In many cases, studies carried out on the basis of point measurements have reported that dioxin emissions to airfrom some European incinerators fall within the new proposed EC limit of 0.1 ng I-TEQ/m 3. For instance, a series of monthly to two-monthly point measurementstaken between 1994 and 1997 from a newly constructedGerman MSW incinerator were below the specified limit(Gass et al. 1998). Two point measurements, taken within a day of each other, subsequent to initial testing of a newlyconstructed MSW incinerator in Venice were below the 0.1 ng I-TEQ/m 3limit (Pietro and Giuliana 1999). A study on a German hazardous waste incinerator was performed which,in fact, used continuous long-term monitoring. Results of 11long-term monitored samples taken between 1998-9showed that air emissions were well within the 0.1 ng I-TEQ/m 3limit (Mayer et al. 1999). Not all studies, however, have returned data indicating compliance with the 0.1 ng I-TEQ/m3regulatory limit. For example, point measurements taken at 1 to 4 monthlyintervals, January 1997 to April 1999, from 8 Spanish MSWincinerators revealed that 2 incinerators failed to comply(Fabrellas et al. 1999). Emission values were 0.7 and 1.08 ng I-TEQ/m3. In Poland, analysis of stack emissions from 18 new or updated medical waste incinerators in 1994-7 found that almost half had emissions below 0.1 ng TEQ/m3, but others exceeded the limit (Grochowalski 1998). For 5 of theincinerators, the limit was considerably exceeded with concentrations ranging from 9.7 to 32 ng TEQ/m3. As discussed previously, a Belgian incinerator exceeded the EC regulatory limit when emissions were measured by continuous monitoring (De Fre and Wevers 1998). The emissions were 8.2 to 12.9 ng TEQ/Nm 3. It is important to note that the scientific literature reporting air emission levels from new and old incinerators presentlyoperating in many countries, including developing countriesis extremely limited. One study of dioxin emissions toatmosphere from the ten incinerators reported to be operating in Korea (Shin et al. 1998) noted a wide variation between different incinerators. Emitted levels ranged from 0.07 to 27.9 Ng TEQ/Nm3of dioxin in the stack gases. Even fewer data have been published on incinerators burning wastes other than MSW. Nonetheless, in Japan,one study reported point measurements on nine industrialwaste incinerators (Yamamura et al. 1999). Dioxin emissions to air were below 0.1 Ng I-TEQ/Nm3for two of the incinerators but were above this level (0.13 to 4.2 Ng I-TEQ/Nm3) for six of them. Cement kilns in the US that were operated using coal as fuel were found to emit0.00133 to 3.0 ng I-TEQ/dscm (Schrieber and Evers 1994).In the US, a further study reported on dioxin air emissionsfrom mobile incinerators. (Meeter et al. 1997). The on-siteremediation of soils at hazardous waste sites by such incinerators is carried out where sites contain compoundsthat are regarded as difficult to destroy. Data collected primarily from trial burns of 16 incinerators showed that 10of the incinerators failed to meet the proposed USEnvironmental Protection Agency (EPA) standard of 0.2 ngTEQ /dscm. The authors commented that a significantnumber of mobile incinerators used in these applicationscould have problems meeting the proposed future EPA limit. 5.1.2 Other Organic Compounds With a very few exceptions, very little research has been carried out on the other organic chemicals known to beemitted to air from incinerators. Of the compounds, whichhave been studied, the focus has largely been directed athigher molecular weight compounds rather than the lesspersistent volatile organic compounds that are known to beemitted (Leach et al. 1999). Compounds for which data have been reported include polyaromatic hydrocarbons(PAHs) and several groups of highly toxic of 209 different individual congeners. Around half this number has been identified in the environment. PCBs are persistent, toxic and bioaccumulative. Accordingly, like the dioxins they have atendency to build up in the fatty tissues of animals andhumans where they can persist almost indefinitely. Themore highly chlorinated PCB congeners are the most persistent and account for the majority of those found asenvironmental pollutants. PCBs have become globally ubiquitous chemicals, and they are even found at highlyelevated concentrations in the tissues of animals living in what have traditionally been regarded as pristine environments. Arctic marine mammals, such as whales,seals and polar bears have been studied and the presenceof PCBs together with other organochlorine contaminantsconfirmed (see Allsopp et al. 1999). PCBs are known to exert a wide range of toxic effects on health includingreproductive, neurological and immunological effects. Theyare suspected of causing many deleterious health effectsboth in wildlife and in humans (see Allsopp et al. 1997,Allsopp et al. 1999). Some PCB congeners also cause \"dioxin-like\" effects on health since they are structurallysimilar chemicals. PCBs produced as industrial chemicals were mainly used for insulation in electrical equipment. Production of PCBshas almost totally ceased worldwide, although there arereports of it continuing in Russia. At least one third of thePCBs that have been produced are estimated to haveentered the environment (Swedish EPA 1999). The otherINCINERATION AND HUMAN HEAL TH48two thirds remain in old electrical equipment and in waste dumps from where they continue to leach into the environment. Although this is by far the major source ofPCB pollution in the environment today, some PCBs are also produced as by-products of incineration and certainchemical processes involving chlorine. PCBs are known to be formed in incinerators (Blumenstock et al. 2000, Wikstrom et al. 1998, Sakai et al. 1996, Fangmark et al. 1994) and are present in stack gases released to the atmosphere (Miyata et al. 1994, Wilken et al.1993, Magagni et al. 1991). Data on levels of PCBs in stack gases are, however, somewhat sparse in the scientificliterature. A study on MSW incinerators in Japan in 1992found that emissions of the highly toxicologically significantcoplanar PCBs varied considerably between different incinerators (Miyata et al. 1994). The mean level (1.46 ng TEQ/m3) was greater than the guideline (0.5 ngTEQ/Nm3) for newly constructed incinerators in Japan. The study concluded that waste incinerators were a source of PCBcontamination in humans, food and environment. PCNs: are a group of chlorinated compounds that are also persistent, bioaccumulative and toxic. When originally produced they were used in similar applications to PCBswhich eventually superseded them. PCNs are known to be produced as unintentional by-products of thermalprocesses involving chlorine including incineration andmetal reclamation (see: Falandysz and Rappe 1997). PCNshave similar properties to dioxins and PCBs and many ofthem have high toxic potential even at small doses (see:Abad et al. 1999, Abad et al. 1997). PCNs have been found to be present in the stack gas of MSW incinerators. The concentration of PCN (mono-to to 21.36 ng/Nm3in five MSW incinerators in Spain, while levels of dioxins varied from 0.01 to 5 ng ITEQ/Nm3(Abad et al. 1999). In addition, PCN congeners exhibiting dioxin-like toxicity have beenidentified in the from municipalwaste incinerators (Falandysz & Rappe 1997, Takasuga et al. 1994). PCNs from incineration and other combustion sources are present at detectable levels in wildlife and these processesmay contribute a significant loading of these highly toxicand persistent chemicals to the environment (Falandysz and Rappe 1997, Falandysz et al. 1996) in addition to the environmental burden resulting from historical manufacture. Chlorinated Benzenes: Chlorinated benzenes are formed in incinerators (Blumenstock et al. 2000, Wikstrom et al. 1998, Fangmark et al. 1994) as are the chlorinated phenols (Wikstrom et al. 1999). It has been shown that these chemicals are released in stack gases (Wilken et al. 1993).The production of hexachlorobenzene (HCB), the fully substituted form of benzene is of particular significance.HCB is persistent, toxic and bioaccumulative. It is toxic toaquatic life, land plants, land animals and humans and hasbeen used extensively as a pesticide and seed dressing.Recent research indicates that HCB can contribute significantly to the dioxin-like toxicity caused by organochlorine chemicals in human milk (van Birgelen1998). It is listed by the IARC as a Group 2B carcinogen, i.e. it is possibly carcinogenic to humans and also appearsto be a tumour promoter. HCB may damage the developingfoetus, liver, immune system, thyroid, kidneys and CNS. Theliver and nervous system are the most sensitive organs toits effects (ATSDR 1997, Newhook & Meek 1994). Halogenated Phenols: including 14 chlorinated, 3 brominated and 31 mixed bromo-chloro phenols have been identified in in MSW incinerator flue gas (Heeb et al. 1995). These chemicals are of considerable importance since dioxins can be formed by condensation reactions of twohalogenated phenol molecules. The concentrations ofmixed brominated and the raw 3; 1.2ug/Nm3) and stack gas (1 nmol/Nm3; 0.5ug/Nm3) exceeded typical raw gas concentrations of the dioxins (0.2nmol/Nm3; 0.1ugNm3) in MSW incineration plant. Brominated and Mixed Halogenated Dioxins: In addition to chlorinated dioxins and furans numerous other halogenated compounds will be formed during incinerationincluding brominated and mixed chlorinated-brominateddioxins and furans. Polychlorinated dibenzothiophenes (PCDBTs): are sulphur containing compounds that are structurally very similar to dibenzofurans. The sulphur substitutes for theoxygen atom found in the furan moiety of dibenzofuranstructure. Little is known about their toxicology, but due totheir structure they are suspected to be toxic. PCDBTs havebeen detected in the stack gas of waste incinerators(Sinkkonen et al. 1991). PAHs: are a group of compounds which are produced as by-products of incomplete combustion of organic substances. Some are persistent, toxic and bioaccumulative.Others are carcinogenic. PAHs are emitted by incinerators in stack gases (Yasuda and Takahashi 1998, Magagni et al. 1991). Waste composition, temperature and excess air during the incineration process determine the quantity ofPAHs emitted by a given facility. High emissions to air ofPAHs have been shown to occur during start-up of incinerators (see Yasuda and Takahashi et al. 1998). Measurements of total PAH incinerator emissions to atmosphere reported in one study were 0.02 to 12 mg/Nm3 (see: Marty 1993). INCINERATION AND HUMAN HEAL TH 49VOCs: Few studies have been conducted on the vast array of other chemicals emitted from waste incinerators. However, one study has been undertaken specifically toidentify and quantify volatile organic compounds (VOCs) inthe stack gas of a MSW incinerator (Jay and Stieglitz1995). This study identified a total of around 250 differentVOC compounds for which concentrations ranged from 0.05 to 100 mg/m 3. The compounds are listed in appendix B. The list includes highly toxic and carcinogenic compounds such as benzene and the substituted phenols,together with other known toxic compounds such as phthalates. Data on the environmental and toxicological significance of many of the VOCs emitted are very limited,but VOCs are known to contribute to ozone formation in the lower atmosphere (see below). Organic compounds emitted by incinerators are generally monitored on the basis of a group parameter which sumsthe total amount present in a sample of the flue gas: Totalorganic Carbon (TOC). In the study reported by Jay andStieglitz (1995), the 250 compounds identified were foundto account for about 42% of the TOC. The remaining 58%were shown to consist of aliphatic hydrocarbons ofunknown identity. Leach et al. (1999) have noted that processes which generate large quantities of VOCs are of environmental significance since, mixed with nitrogen oxides and exposedto sunlight, they aid in the formation of photochemical oxidants (ozone and peroxyacyl nitrates), with deleteriousimpacts upon ambient air quality. The proposed new EC limit for total VOC (expressed as carbon) is 20 mg/ Nm 3. 5.1.3 Heavy Metals Heavy metals are emitted from all types of incinerators. Many heavy metals are known to be toxic at low concentrations and some are persistent and bioaccumulative. Further information on the toxicity of some heavy metals is given in appendix A. Heavy metalsenter the incinerator as components of various materials inthe raw waste. The process of incineration leads to theirbeing concentrated by a factor of up to 10 in the wasteresidues (ashes) as the volume of waste is reduced throughcombustion (Buchholz and Landsberger 1995). A proportionof these toxic trace metals is emitted in the stack gases ofincinerators to atmosphere. The major proportion is generally present in fly ash and bottom ash with the exception of mercury where the greater proportion is vented via the flue stack. Each metal has its own major source in the raw waste. Mercury is present due to the disposal of batteries, fluorescent light bulbs and paints (Carpi 1997). Cadmiumis present in paints, PVC plastics and the pigments used tocolour plastics. Lead is present in batteries, plastics andpigments (Valerio et al. 1995, Korzan and Heck 1990), and antimony is present in flame-retardants (van Velzen andLangenkamp (1996) used in plastic items. On a global scale, incineration contributes significantly to atmospheric emissions of many heavy metals, as shown in table 5.1 (EEA 2000). Within the EU, figures for 1990estimated incineration to be responsible for 8% (16t/yr) of all cadmium emissions and 16% (36t/yr) of mercuryemissions. Emissions of chromium amounted to 46 tonnesand over 300 tonnes of lead in addition (EC 1998). A variety of flue gas treatment systems have been devised in order to reduce stack emissions of heavy metals (EEA2000). Stack gas data for hazardous waste incineratorsindicate that the fabric filter removal efficiencies (with themetals retained in the ash arisings) are in the order of 95%for most metals except mercury. The EEA (2000) note that control of mercury releases constitutes a special problem in incineration. Almost 100%of the elemental mercury present in waste is emitted via thestack gases because it does not adsorb to filter dusts orashes. Elemental mercury comprises about 20-50% of thetotal mercury emitted. The remainder is in the form of divalent mercury which may be predominantly mercurychloride (HgCl2). After emission to the atmosphere, divalentmercury, which is water soluble, may be deposited close tothe incinerator. On the other hand, elemental mercury maybe transported for long distances by atmospheric currentsbefore it is eventually converted to the divalent form. Thiscan then become deposited on the ground (Carpi 1997). Despite the acknowledged significance of the fate of toxic heavy metals present in the waste-streams, published dataon the concentrations of heavy metals in stack emissionsappears to be very limited. Nonetheless, according to anemissions inventory in the Netherlands, stack emissions ofcadmium and mercury were reduced considerably between1990 and 1995 from MSW incinerators as a result of modernisation (Born 1996). During this period, the contribution to the total Dutch air emissions of cadmiumreduced from 44 to 13% and mercury from 53 to 11%. Thereduction of atmospheric emissions (assuming the data are reliable) means that metals retained in the facility by pollution control devices will be retained in fly ash residues. INCINERATION AND HUMAN HEAL TH505.1.4 Particulate Matter Minute particles of matter suspended in the air, often called particulates, are present as a result of both natural andhuman activities. Those of natural origin are derived fromwind blown soil particles, sea salt, dusts from volcaniceruptions, spores from fungi and pollen grains from plants.Those from human activities are the result of combustionprocesses, such as coal-burning, incineration and vehicleexhaust. As a broad generalisation, natural particulates aregenerally larger in size (>2.5\u00b5m) than combustion processes (<2.5 \u00b5m), (QUARG1996, COMEAP 1995, EPAQS It is particulates, known as \"respirable particles\" which are ofgreat concern in relation to human health. Particulate pollution is implicated in the worsening of respiratory illnesses such as asthma, and increasing premature mortality from respiratory and heart diseases. This isbecause the respirable particulates are small enough to be inhaled into the extremities of the lung airways, whereaslarger particles are prevented from reaching the deep airways by the respiratory system's protective mechanisms.In particular, those particulates sized <0.1\u00b5m, termed ultrafine particles, are of greatest concern in regard toadverse effects on human health. A more detailed description of particulates and their health impacts is given in appendix A. Incineration gives rise to atmospheric emissions of particulates (EC 1998). Poorly controlled incineration plantscan emit high levels of particulate matter and contribute tolocal environmental problems. Modern incinerators emitlower levels, but data suggests that the particulates emittedare fine in size and therefore would be contributing toadverse health effects (EC 1998). Indeed, the majority ofparticles formed from combustion processes, including all types of waste incineration, are ultrafine particles that areless than 0.1 mm in size. Even the most modern MSWincinerators do not have technology that prevents therelease of ultrafine particles. Collection efficiencies for respirable particles (less than 2.5 \u00b5m) are between 5 and30 % using current bag filter technology. For particles lessthan 1 mm in size, which includes all ultrafine particles,most will pass through incinerator filtration systems unabated. Furthermore, there are indications that some of the modern pollution abatement equipment installed inincinerators, particularly ammonia injection, which attemptto reduce oxides of nitrogen, may actually increase the airemissions of the finest, most dangerous particles (Howard 2000). At present, there is only limited information on the chemical composition of particulates. Emissions to the atmospherefrom incinerators include, for example, particles formed of mineral oxides and salts from the mineral constituents in the waste (Oppelt 1990). Heavy metals and organicchemicals such as dioxins, PCBs and PAHs can adhere ontothe surface of the particles. Metals may absorb in a numberof different forms including metal oxides, soluble salts andmetal carbonates. The chemical nature of particulates, forinstance, the form of metal, or the type of other potentiallytoxic chemical adhered to the particle surface, may ultimately influence the effects on health resulting fromexposure (QUARG 1996, Seaton 1995, Marty 1993). Ultrafine particles have been found to be highly chemically reactive, even when they originate from material which itselfis not reactive. This is solely due to their minute size.Research has shown that a proportionally higher number ofMetal Emissions (1000 tonnes/year) Emissions (as a % of total emissions) Antimony ArsenicCadmiumChromiumCopper LeadManganeseMercuryNickelSeleniumTinVanadiumZinc0.670.310.750.841.582.378.261.160.350.110.811.155.9019.03.09.02.04.020.721.032.00.611.015.01.04.0Table 5.3. Worldwide Atmospheric Emissions of Trace Metals from Waste IncinerationINCINERATION AND HUMAN HEAL TH 51surface atoms are present as the particles size decreases. This leads to their surface becoming highly charged andtherefore chemically reactive. In addition, ultrafine metalparticles have been shown to be especially chemically reactive (Jefferson and Tilley 1999). MSW incinerators typically have a mixed waste input containing heavy metals and halogenated organic compounds. They emit ultrafine metal particulates. Sincethese particles are especially reactive, it can be argued thatMSW incinerators will therefore produce a more toxic ultrafine particulate aerosol than for example a coal-firedpower station (Howard 2000). In this regard, incineratorsare of utmost concern regarding health of the general public. The new EC directive on incineration of waste does not give any limits for PM10, or perhaps even more appropriately,PM 2.5, that is respirable particles, less than 2.5 \u00b5m. In thisway the directive ignores the particulate pollution fromincinerators which is of most relevance to public health. Thedirective does specify a limit for total dust emissions to air of 10 mg/m 3from incinerators. Data published in the 1980s gave air emissions of particulate from UK MSW incinerators ranging from 18-4105 mg/m3(Williams 1990), and from US hazardous waste incinerators ranging from 4-902 mg/m3 (Dempsey and Oppelt 1993). A recent report on MSW incinerators in Sweden reported particulate emissions of 0.003 to 64 mg/m3. Four out of 21 Swedish incinerators exceeded the EC limit on dust emissions (GreenpeaceNordic 2000). 5.1.5 Inorganic Gases (HBr), sulphuroxides (SO x), and nitrogen oxides (NOx) are formed and emitted by incinerators. These gases arise as a consequence of the elements chlorine, fluorine, bromine,sulphur and nitrogen being present in waste (Williams1990). NO xare also formed as a result of the direct combination of nitrogen and oxygen, a process that is accelerated at high temperatures. HCl is emitted in greater quantities from incinerators than from coal-fired power stations. This is due to chlorine in thewaste, notably in the form of plastics such as PVC (Williams1990). The new EC directive sets a limit (daily average value) of 10 mg/m 3for HCl and 1 mg/m3for HF (EC 1998). study of 21 Swedish MSW incinerators reportedthat HCl emissions to air from 1 7 of them exceeded the EC limit, often to a substantial degree (Greenpeace Nordic2000). The average release from the 21 incinerators was 44 mg/Nm 3with a range of 0.2-238 mg/Nm3. Oxides of nitrogen (NOx), including nitrogen dioxide (NO2), and oxides of sulphur (SOx), including sulphur dioxide (SO2), are emitted from industrial combustion processes including all types of incinerators. These gases can also influence the pH of rain, making it acidic. Over time, acidrain can have deleterious effects on soil and water quality,and adversely affect ecosystems. Like exposure to particulate air pollution, exposure to NO xand SOxis also linked to adverse effects on respiratory health of individuals with pre-existing respiratory disorders. For instance,research has shown associations between increased air pollution levels of SO 2and increased premature deaths in individuals who had pre-existing respiratory or cardiovascular illness. Similarly an association is evidentwith increased hospital admissions in individuals with pre-existing respiratory illness such as asthma or chronicobstructive pulmonary disease. Studies have also shownassociations between exposure to NO 2and worsened symptoms of respiratory illness although the data is not consistent or conclusive (Ayres 1998). NOxand SOxemissions also result in the formation of particulates, known as secondary particulates. The formation of secondary particulates occurs as a consequence of these gases undergoing chemical reactionsin the atmosphere. They originate from the chemical oxidation of sulphur and nitrogen oxides in the atmosphereto acids, which are subsequently neutralised by atmospheric ammonia. The particles formed include ammonium sulphate and ammonium nitrate. These particles, which are generally soluble in nature, persist inthe air for long periods of time. A less abundant type ofsecondary particle is ammonium chloride which originatesfrom HCl gas. Like primary particles, secondary particlescan have a wide variety of other potentially toxic organiccompounds adsorbed onto their surfaces such as PAHs,and dioxins 1995, EPAQS 1995).Like primary particulates from incinerators, secondary particulates are also thought to have adverse impacts on human health (e.g. see EC 1998) Presently, NOx emissions from incinerators are not regulated through EC limits although limits are proposed in the new EC directive. A limit (daily average value) fornitrogen monoxide and nitrogen dioxide, expressed as nitrogen dioxide, of 200 mg/m 3is proposed (for existing incineration plants with a capacity exceeding 3 tonnes perhour, or new incineration plants). A recent study of 12Swedish MSW incinerators documented emissions ranging from 1.2 - 236 mg/Nm 3. 4 of the 12 exceeded the EC limit. INCINERATION AND HUMAN HEAL TH52The EC directive on incineration of wastes proposes a limit (daily average value) for sulphur dioxide of 50 mg/m3. A recent report on 10 Swedish incinerators found that emissions ranged from 1.2 to 236 mg/Nm3. Of the 10 incinerators, 9 of them had emissions that exceeded the EClimit (Greenpeace Nordic 2000). 5.1.6 Other Gases Carbon dioxide (CO2) is emitted by incinerators. Municipal waste contains around 25% by weight of carbon and this is released as CO2when waste is burned. Approximately one tonne of CO2is produced per tonne of waste incinerated. CO2is a greenhouse gas that affects climate change and releases have to be kept as small as possible (EEA 2000). There is no EC limit on emissions of CO2from incinerators. Carbon monoxide is also released from incinerators. It is potentially toxic and is also a greenhouse gas. Researchsuggests that increases in CO levels in the air may be linkedto health impacts in certain susceptible individuals with pre-existing heart disease (Ayres 1998). A recent study onSwedish incinerators found that of the 15 incinerators whichrecorded emissions, 10 exceeded the new EC limit of 50 mg/Nm 3(Greenpeace Nordic 2000). Emissions ranged from 2.6 to 249 mg/Nm3. 5.2 Releases to Water Incinerators emit wastes to water from cleaning equipment. Published scientific data on these emissions is very limited.Wastewater from wet exhaust gas cleaning contains heavymetals, the most significant in terms of quantity emittedand toxicity being lead, cadmium, copper, mercury, zincand antinomy. Wastewater from wet slag removal equipment contains high levels of neutral salts and alsocontains unburned organic material from the residue (EEA 2000). 5.3 Releases to Ashes Ashes from waste incineration generally contain the same pollutants as air emissions, but may differ in concentrationand composition (EEA 2000). Fly ashes and bottom ashescontain dioxins and heavy metals although, as for air emissions, little is known about many other compoundspresent in fly ash. 5.3.1 Organic Compounds Information about the contents of organic compounds in bottom ashes is scarce, with the exception of dioxins forwhich there are some data (EEA 2000). Dioxins Dioxin emissions from incinerators to air and water have decreased in recent years due to improvements in pollutioncontrol equipment. However, it is difficult to tell whether the total releases of dioxins from incinerators have declined atthe same time. It is highly probable that while emissions toair via stack gases have decreased, releases with the asheshave increased. Indeed, it has been proposed that the totaldioxin releases from incineration probably have not beenreduced greatly in recent decades (Wikstrom 1999). A theoretical assessment of the total emissions from a MSWincinerator in Sweden also found that a reduction of dioxinsemitted in flue gases would result in an increase in ash(GRAAB 1996). Thus, the total dioxin releases from theplant would remain the same, regardless of improvementsin air pollution abatement technology. There are relatively few data about dioxins in fly ashes and bottom ashes because many installations are not obligatedto control them (Fabrellas et al. 1999, Greenpeace Nordic 1999). A theoretical assessment of releases from an incinerator in Sweden suggested that 97% of the total dioxin emissions from an incinerator would be present in the ash. This is in close agreement with direct measurements from an incinerator (Spittelau) in Austria,which showed that 99.6% of the total dioxin releases werein ash residues (Greenpeace Austria 1999). A study on aSpanish incinerator also noted that only a minor proportionof dioxin emissions is through stack gases, the majoritybeing in ashes (Abad et al. 2000). In addition to chlorinated dioxins, it is also likely that other halogenated dioxins andfurans are present in ashes, as in flue gases, such as brominated and mixed chlorinated/brominated compounds.A study on medical and MSW incinerator fly ashes foundresults suggesting that iodinated dioxins are also likely to be present (Kashima et al. 1999). With regard to levels of dioxins in incinerator residues, the highest levels have been found in fly ash. Levels characteristically range from parts per trillion (ppt) to partsper billion (ppb), (EEA 2000). Research on eight MSWincinerators in Spain found mean levels in fly ash between0.07 and 3.5 ng I-TEQ/g (ppb) (Fabrellas et al. 1999). Another study on a MSW incinerator in Spain reported levels which fell within this range from two measurements,which were 0.37 and 0.65 ng I-TEQ/g (ppb) (Abad et al. 2000). Particularly high levels were reported for one Spanish incinerator in 1997 (41 ppb TEQ) although levels in 1999 were lower (Stieglitz et al. 1999). Lower concentrations are apparent in bottom ash samples, typically ppt levels (EEA 2000). For instance, mean valuesfor 6, 13 and 98 ppt TEQ),(Fabrellas et al. 1999). Similarly, levels in bottom ashes from five MSW incinerators in Bavaria, Germany ranged from 1.6to 24 ppt TEQ (Marb et al. 1997). Ash from 18 new or updated medical waste incinerators in Poland INCINERATION AND HUMAN HEAL TH 53sampled in 1994-7 had substantially higher levels of dioxins ranging from 8-45 ppb TEQ (Grochowalski 1998). Based on limited sampling, Abad et al. (2000) noted that although the highest concentrations of dioxins are presentin fly ash, the high production of bottom ash in incineratorsmeans that the annual output of dioxins in bottom ash iscomparable to that of fly ash. However, a study of eightMSW incinerators in Spain calculated that the overall outputof dioxins was higher for fly ash (Fabrellas et al. 1999). The total yearly output of dioxins from 8 MSW incineratorsreported to be operating in Spain, based on point measurements, was flue gases 1-1.2, fly ashes 46.6-111.6and bottom ashes 2-19 g I-TEQ/y (Fabrellas et al. 1999). As mentioned in the previous section, dioxin inventories most often underestimate releases from incineratorsbecause ashes are not included in calculations. A report onoutput of dioxins from Swedish incinerators has proposedthat the Swedish EPA have grossly underestimated totalincinerator emissions by underestimating ash contaminationin ashes (Greenpeace Nordic 1999). Other Organic Compounds As previously discussed in this report, emissions of organic compounds to stack gases are multitudinous and fly ashesare similarly laden with numerous compounds. The EEA(2000) note that fly ash contains concentrated organiccompounds, such as PAHs and soot as well as chlorinatedorganic compounds. PCBs are known to be present in flyash (see e.g. Sakai et al. 1996). PCBs were reported to be detected in fly ash of hospital and MSW waste incinerators(Magagni et al. 1994), and in sewage sludge incinerator fly ash and bottom ash (Kawakami et al. 1998). The level of PCBs in fly ash from sewage sludge incinerators was 7 .1ng/g with the proportion of PCBs to dioxins being similar to that found in MSW incinerators. PCNs have also beenidentified in incinerator fly ash (Schneider et al. 1998). A study on fly ash from MSW incinerators identified 72 different phenolic compounds in the ash including manyunknown ones (Nito and Takeshita 1996). Most of the compounds were hydroxy compounds of PAHs, polychlorinated PAHs, PCBs and dioxins. The study notedthat some of these halogenated hydroxy compounds maybe persistent and toxic and their toxicities should be evaluated because they will be leached from fly ash into the environment after disposal in landfill. Another studyidentified many new kinds of aza-heterocyclic hydrocarbons(azaarenes and other basic compounds in fly ash (Nito and Ishizaki 1997). These compounds are produced byincomplete combustion and this study confirmed that incinerators are a source of them. The study identified 63and 18 kinds of azaareness from two different fractions offly ash respectively. phenylpyridine, biphenylamine and theirisomers comprised the majority. Of concern is that many of them are known to be carcinogenic or mutagenic compounds. Leaching of such compounds from fly ash in landfill would release these toxic chemicals into the environment. 5.3.2 Heavy Metals Both fly ash and bottom ash residues from incinerators contain many heavy metals. Fly ash generally has highermetal concentrations than bottom ash if the large, unburnedmetal fragments from the bottom ash are excluded(Bucholz and Landsberger 1995). Table 5.4 shows concentrations of heavy metals detected in fly ash and bottom ash from two Spanish MSW incinerators (Alba et al. 1997) and table 5.5 shows concentrations detected in ashes from a US incinerator (Bucholz and Landsberger1995). The concentrations of heavy metals in incineratorashes are very high compared to background levels in theenvironment. For instance, if concentrations in bulk ash(combined fly + bottom ash) are compared with averageconcentrations of heavy metals found in soil globally, it isclear that bulk ash contains elevated amounts of many metals (Bucholz and Landsberger 1995). In addition, theprocess of incineration greatly enhances the mobility andbioavailability of toxic metals compared with raw municipalwaste (Schumacher et al. 1998). Consequently, there is greater potential for leaching of metals into the environmentfrom ashes dumped in landfill than from ordinary waste(see section 5.4.1). A study on incinerator ashes from veterinary college incinerators in which animal carcasses are burned foundthat levels of metals varied considerably between incinerators (Thompson et al. 1995). Generally levels of metals in the ashes were much lower than levels found inMSW incinerator ashes. One exception was zinc, whichwas at a similar level. It was noted that burning of plasticsin the waste may contribute to lead and zinc content in the ashes. Given that incinerator companies are not required under national laws in many countries to routinely monitor ashes,published data on heavy metal levels in ashes and exceeding of those regulatory limits which are in place are sparse. One study in the US of hazardous waste incinerators that the metals which most frequently exceeded regulatory limits were arsenic, nickel and lead (Dempsey and Oppelt 1993). 5.4 Disposal of Ashes Fly ashes are potentially toxic because of their heavy metal and salt content and consequently they require propermanagement (Alba et al. 1997). They also contain other organic toxic chemicals including dioxins. According to theEEA (2000), the disposal of fly ash from waste incinerationplants is a serious problem. Under some regulations flyashes could be classified as hazardous waste (Alba et al. 1997). Indeed, due to the high content of lead and cadmium in fly ash, it is classified as toxic waste underItalian law (Magagni et al. 1994). In response to concerns regarding incinerator ash disposal, theInternational Ash Working Group was established to compile and evaluate available information (Sawell et al. 1995) and has subsequently published its findings (Chandler et al. 1997). Unlike fly ash, bottom ash is generally not classified as special waste. Nevertheless, bottom ashes also containtoxic substances and according to information cited byBrereton (1996), the potential leaching rates of metals from bottom ashes are such that there is clearly an environmental concern attached to their disposal. Presently, fly ash is usually disposed of in landfill whilst bottom ash is disposed of in landfill or is used in INCINERATION AND HUMAN HEAL TH54Element Fly Ash Bottom Ash Soil Ag AlAsBrCdCoCrCuHgInMoPbSeSnThTiVZn46-55.33.19-7 .84%269-3553830-3920246-26611.3-13.5146-169390-53059.1-65.01.50-1.6714-263200-43206.7-11.2470-6302.85-3.213300-630027-3613360-134901 7 .5-28.56.20-6.68%47 .2-52.0676-83047 .6-65.565.2-90.3623-8071560-21109.1-9.70.45-0.7 1100-1812090-2860<2.52300-4104.31-4.867500-1810046-1376610-67900.17.1 %650.068100200.030.072100.2105500010050Table 5.4 Ranges of elemental abundance in MSW incinerator ashes and in soil.

In Canada, most European countries and Japan, bottom ash is handled separately from fly ash,whereas the current trend in the US is to combine all theresidues and dispose of this waste in dedicated landfills(Chandler et al. 1997). The cost of disposal of ashes is a significant impact on the total cost of incineration (Brereton1996). Utilisation of ash for construction purposes reducesthe costs of ash disposal. However, the hazardous nature ofincinerator ashes, and the eventual release of hazardouscompounds such as persistent chemicals or heavy metalsback into the environment calls into question this use.Furthermore, Shane et al. (1993) showed that the extent to which ashes were mutagenic varied with time. For example,samples taken at different times from the same incineratorvaried in their mutagenic potential. Since it is unlikely thatincinerator ashes are regularly checked for mutagenicity thisagain raises questions about further uses. It has been notedthat another possible use for incinerator ash is as a fertiliser.However, the uptake of certain metals such as cadmiumfrom MSW ash amended soil into edible plants, and thusinto the human food supply, often precludes the use of flyash in this manner (see Shane et al. 1993). The uses of fly ash and bottom ash for construction and other purposesare further discussed in section 5.4.1 below. 5.4.1 Disposal of Fly Ash In the UK, it has been reported that fly ashes are disposed of in ordinary landfills, some of which are unlined (Mitchell et al. 1992). This is of great concern because toxic components in the ashes, in particular heavy metals, willcontaminate subsoil above background levels. Dependingon the pH of the soil, rainfall can leach metals from thelandfilled ash into groundwater used for drinking. Leachingis greatest under acidic conditions. Since the ashes are frequently co-disposed with ordinary municipal waste, thesurrounding soils can be acidified through organic acidswhich are the breakdown products of landfilled waste. This leads to greater leaching of heavy metals (Marty 1993).Furthermore, dumping of incinerator ash in landfills is ofgreater significance than normal waste going to landfillbecause not only is the concentration of metals higher inash than normal waste, but it is also likely to be in a moresoluble form and therefore more likely to leach. In one UKstudy, it was noted that levels of zinc, lead and cadmiumwere of particular concern in incinerator fly ash (Mitchell et al. 1992). With regard to dioxins, according to the EEA (2000), these chemicals are strongly bound to the surfaceof ash residues, are highly insoluble in water, and consequently they will not leach to a significant extent from landfills to groundwater. Tests on leaching of metals from incinerator ashes have shown that the quantity of elements/heavy metals, whichleach, is determined in particular by pH. The more acidicthe solution used, the greater the amount of leaching (e.g.Fleming et al. 1996, Buchholz and Landsberger 1995). Significant releases of cadmium, lead and chromium however have been found to leach under neutral conditionswith distilled water (Mangialardi et al. 1998). Lead has been deemed the most leachable heavy metal from fly ash(Chandler et al. 1997). Studies on the leaching of heavy metals from incinerator ash with water that simulates acidrain, has shown that leaching of metals to a significantdegree occurs most readily with the first washing of theashes (Buchholz and Landsberger 1995). This study notedthat from this initial leaching, the metals/elements Ag, Ba,Be, Cr, Cu, Mo, Pb, S, Ti, and Zn appeared to pose thegreatest threat to groundwater. Leaching over longer timeperiods was much less, but As, Cd, Cu, Hg, Pb, S and Znwere identified as potential long-term hazards over the lifetime of ash dumped in a landfill. In terms of very longtime periods over hundreds to thousands of years, it hasbeen noted that little is known about the long-term leachingbehaviour of incinerator residues (Chandler et al. 1997). This is of immense concern given that landfills are unlikelyto be managed indefinitely. Currently, at landfills where leachate from the waste is collected, it is generally disposed of to municipal wastewater treatment plants. Such leachates from fly ash in landfills may be particularly high in lead and cadmium(Chandler et al. 1997). These and other trace metals will thus be directly discharged to the environment whereleachate is disposed of via the general wastewater treatment system. In addition to leaching of chemical contaminants from landfills, pollutants may also re-enter the environment vialandfill fires. Landfill fires have been reported to be commonin Finland and research has shown the release of dioxins,PCBs, PAHs and other contaminants from such fires inSweden and Finland (see Ruokoj\u00e4rvi et al. (1995). Pre-treatment of fly ash before disposal is being used increasingly in an attempt to reduce leaching. In their document on dangerous substances in waste, the EEA stipulate that fly ash cannot be landfilled without pre-treatment (EEA 2000). The focus on pre-treatment hasbeen towards a minimum cost treatment which bringsleachability into conformance with guidelines for disposal.This most commonly involves stabilisation of the ash incement. According to Brereton (1996), the stabilised wastemay then be suitable as some form of fill, or should be suitable for regular landfill. Chandler et al. (1997) report that some incinerators in Germany, Sweden, Switzerlandand Austria stabilise fly ash using cement. Once stabilised,the use of fly ash in construction materials is not commonin many countries. Exceptions are the Netherlands whereabout 50% of fly ash is used as filler in asphalt and Austriawhere the ash is used in concrete constructionINCINERATION AND HUMAN HEAL TH56(Greenpeace Austria 1999). On this note, it is of concern that a study on the use of fly ash for construction materialhas shown that these materials may subsequently leachmetals (Fleming et al. 1996). Furthermore, whether fly ash is directly landfilled, is stabilised and then landfilled, or isstabilised in construction materials, it is important to realisethat weathering and erosion will eventually result in the re-entry of persistent pollutants from the ash, includingheavy metals, back into the environment. Another treatment of fly ash has involved further thermal treatment in an attempt to reduce dioxin content. This hasbeen successful under experimental conditions (e.g.Buekens and Huang 1998). However, nothing appears tohave been reported on the formation of other potentiallytoxic chemicals as a result of the process. Moreover, heavymetals will remain in the waste. 5.4.2 Disposal of Bottom Ash Like fly ash, bottom ash from incinerators is either land-filled or is used for construction purposes. Tests onleachate from bottom ash in landfills has revealed leachingof inorganic salts, but negligible leaching of heavy metals in the short term (Chandler et al. 1997). In some European countries, including, Denmark, France, Germany, TheNetherlands, significant quantities (40 to 60% or more) ofbottom ash from incinerators is being used in constructionpurposes (Chandler et al. 1997). It is largely used as base and sub-base for road construction. It is also used undercycle paths. Research on the use of bottom ashes in concrete has determined that such concrete has a lowercompressive strength than concrete made with conventionalaggregate (Chang et al. 1999). It is important to note that there are serious and legitimate concerns regarding the useof bottom ash in construction materials due to the presenceof toxic components in the ash which could later enter theenvironment. The future release of these compounds due to weathering and degradation may have detrimental consequences for man, particularly in cases where the substances may enter the food chain (Korzun and Heck 1990). Some of the possible dangers of utilising fly ash and bottom ash have recently become apparent in the UK(ENDS 2000a). Many MSW incinerators were compulsoryclosed in the UK by the end of 1996 to comply with the EC\"Air Framework Directive\" (84/36/EEC) and the\"Incineration of Municipal Wastes Directive\" (89/429/EEC),(see Leach et al. 1999). One of the remaining and presently operating incinerators that was deemed to comply with theEC directives was the Byker incinerator, sited in Newcastle.From 1994 to 1999, a mixture of fly ash and bottom ashfrom the Byker incinerator in Newcastle has been used onallotments and on paths. Concern by local residents aboutpossible toxic substances in the ash prompted the localhealth authority and council to organise an analysis of dioxins and heavy metals in the ash. Initial results showedhigh levels of dioxins in the ash and residents were advisedthat children under two years of age should not play on theallotments, eggs and animal produce from the allotmentsshould not be consumed, and all vegetables should bewashed or peeled before eating. The final results of theanalysis showed that levels of several heavy metals in theash and dioxins were far higher than usual background levels. The average concentration of dioxin was very high,1373 ng TEQ/kg, with a maximum concentration of 4224ng TEQ/kg. These levels exceed the relevant German regulatory guidelines for dioxins. For instance, restrictionson growing of agricultural crops are recommended above40 ng TEQ/kg, and it is recommended that remediationshould be carried out if playgrounds exceed 100 ng TEQ/kgand if residential areas exceed 1000 ng TEQ/kg. With theexception of mercury, all the other heavy metals testedexceeded the Dutch trigger values for soils, as shown intable 5.6. The Dutch guidelines are used by planningauthorities in Britain. As a consequence of the high levels of toxic substances in the ash, all of it had to be removed.This was at a cost to the local council of \u00a350-70,000. It isof great concern that the use of this ash for paths and allotments was permitted to happen by the regulatoryauthorities and begs the question whether similar incidences have occurred but remained unnoticed in the UK or in other countries. The new EC directive (EC 1999) does not propose any limits for the quantity of heavy metals in fly ash or bottomash. This is of concern given the fact that most heavy metals from incineration are sequestered in the ashes andpose an environmental contamination problem. The directive does state however that \"appropriate tests shall be carried out to establish the physical and chemical characteristics and polluting potential of the different incineration residues. The analysisshall concern in particular the total soluble fraction and heavy metals soluble fraction\". It also states that \"residues shall be recycled as far as possible directly in the plant or outside in accordance with relevant Community legislation and national provisions\". Thus the EC condones the use of ashes for other purposes, which could lead tofuture environmental contamination and threats to health asdiscussed and exemplified above.

Presently, 60% of waste generatedthroughout countries in the European Union goes to landfill(Hens et al. 2000). This situation is made worse by the growing amount of waste being generated. For example: Total waste production in the EU rose by nearly 10% between 1990 to 1995 and a further 20% increase has been predicted to occur by 2010 (EEA 1999). In Estonia, Slovenia, Lithuania, Slovak Republic, Bulgaria, Hungary, Czech Republic, Romania, and Poland, economic growth may lead to a doubling of municipal waste generation by 2010 (EEA 1999). In Asia, municipal waste from urban areas is predicted to double by 2025 (World Bank 1999). One of the methods being chosen to deal with the current waste crisis is incineration, a method which is promoted asreducing the volume of solid waste thereby lessening theburden on landfill. However, incinerators are not the solutionto the waste problem. Indeed, they are symptoms of non-existent and/or ill-conceived policies for the management of material resources. In a world of shrinkingresources, it is irrational to let valuable resources \"go up insmoke,\" and doubly so when the smoke is known to carrypersistent and other hazardous chemicals. Incineration cannot be regarded as a sustainable technology for wastemanagement and has no place in a world striving tochange towards zero discharge technologies. It is notable that incineration has already been banned by the government of the Philippines, a move primarily instigated by public opposition to incineration. ThePhilippines is the first country in the world to ban incineration on a national scale. The Philippine Clean Air Actof 1999 specifically bans the incineration of municipal,medical and hazardous wastes and recommends the use ofalternative techniques (for municipal waste) and non-burntechnologies. Waste reduction, re-use and recycling arebeing promoted. The Clean Air Act mandates a three-yearphase out period for existing medical incinerators, and during this time, limits hospitals to incineration of infectious waste. 6.1 Problems of Incineration 6.1.1 Environment and Health No matter how modern an incinerator is, these facilities inevitably result in the release of toxic emissions to air andthe production of toxic ashes and residues. This leads tocontamination of the environment and to potential exposureof animals and humans to hazardous pollutants. Many hazardous compounds are released from incinerators including organic chemicals such as chlorinated and brominated dioxins, PCBs and PCNs, heavy metals, sulphurdioxide and nitrogen dioxide. Furthermore, innumerablesubstances are emitted which are of unknown toxicity. Theentire impact on human health of exposure to the wholemixture of chemicals emitted from incinerators is unknown.However, studies imply that individuals who work at waste incinerators and who live near incinerators have sufferedfrom increases in the rate of mortality as well as many otherdiseases and effects that diminish the quality of their lives.Moreover, a prestigious scientific body has recentlyexpressed \"substantial\" concern about the impacts of incinerator-derived dioxin releases on the health and well-being of broader populations, regardless of the implementation of maximum achievable control technology(NRC 2000). 6.1.2 Economics The economics of waste management in general, and in particular incineration, are extremely complex and are outside the scope of this report. Briefly, it has been notedthat incineration is a technology of the previous industrialera and is only economically feasible if much of its cost isexternalised ie. borne by the general public. Pollution control constitutes a major proportion of the cost, but using such technology to reduce the toxics entering the air cannot help but redistribute them back to deposits in the ash. A recent trend has been to generate electricity from burning waste in MSW incinerators. This can only be seenas a by-product of incineration and not a contributor to sustainable energy production. Indeed, incinerators such as MSW incinerators, are inefficient energy producers withonly 20% of the energy generated by the waste usuallybeing captured. Murray (1999) has described incinerationas inefficient both as a disposal option and as an energygenerator. It leads not to material conservation and hazardreduction but to material destruction and hazard creation. In the UK, a situation has arisen whereby contracts with incinerator operators lock local authorities into long termcommitments to provide huge amounts of waste each year.This works against waste prevention, re-use and recyclingsince local authorities would have to pay financial penaltiesto incinerator owners if waste was reduced and diverted tore-use/recycling schemes. 6.1.3 Sustainability The Convention for the Protection of the Marine Environment of the North East Atlantic (the OSPARConvention, formed from the amalgamation of the formerOslo and Paris Conventions) entered into force in March1998 and covers the 15 States of the North East AtlanticINCINERATION AND HUMAN HEAL TH60Region and the European Union. At the OSPAR meeting held in Sintra in June 1998, Ministers at OSPAR agreed on a clear commitment for the cessation of release of hazardous substances within one generation (by 2020). Inessence, the commitment means that a target has been set for the cessation of discharges, emissions and losses of hazardous substances (or the processes that generatethem) and their substitution with non-hazardous alternatives. In practice this means a shift away from dirtytechnologies towards clean production and zero emissionstrategies. Incinerators can never comply with the zeroemissions strategy or be classed as a clean productiontechnology. This old, dirty technology is not in agreementwith sustainable development or political commitmentsalready made within Europe. In effect, under the provisionsof the OSPAR agreement, incineration is finally and irrevocably made obsolete. 6.2 Current EU Policy and Waste Management Waste policy in the EU widely accepts the hierarchy of waste management to be (in order of priority): waste prevention - re-use - recycling - thermal decompositionwith energy recovery (i.e. incineration with energy recovery).In spite of this general consensus, and a growing coherence of this hierarchy in policy lines of individual EU member states as a consequence of EU-Directives, the majority of waste in Europe is either landfilled or incinerated. Importantly, these are the methods which alsoentail the highest and most serious environmental andhealth risks (Hens et al. 2000). A move towards a waste policy aimed at reducing health effects should put more emphasis on prevention and re-use. Presently, EU waste policy is not founded uponhealth data. Fortunately the available data on health effectsfrom waste management do not conflict, and in importantaspects even coincide with the hierarchy proposed by theEU (Hens 2000). For example, waste prevention is deemedto be the most important (no waste equals no healtheffects), followed by re-use and recycling. Despite this, thelack of consideration of the environment and human healthis clearly visible in EU policy. For instance, regulations put in place for incineration by the EU together, with nationallimits on this issue, are based on what is technically achievable rather than on health and environmental data. Although emission limits set in the new EU directive have resulted in the closure and upgrading of some olderincinerators in European countries, the policy itself isalready outdated with regard to the OPSPAR agreement to phase out the releases of all hazardous substances within one generation. The EU directive is based on theconception that small releases of hazardous substances are acceptable. This is the conventional (though misguided)approach which proposes that chemicals can be managedat \"safe\" levels in the environment. However, it is already known, or is a scientific opinion, that there are no \"safe\"levels of many environmental chemical pollutants such as dioxins, other persistent, bioaccumulative and toxicchemicals and endocrine disruptors. In addition, the abandonment of the principle is increasing in political circles. For instance, with regard to incineration, the UKenvironment minister, Mr. Michael Meacher, recently recognised the futility of the conventional approach tochemicals regulation when he said: Q440...\"I repeat that emissions from incinerator processes are extremely toxic. Some of the emissions arecarcinogenic. We know scientifically that there is no safethreshold below which one can allow such emissions\"(cited in Howard 2000). Despite the commitment by the OSPAR Convention for the cessation of all hazardous substances by 2020, a recenttrend for plans to build new incinerators by the governmentin the UK and other European countries continues. 6.3 The Way Forward: Adoption of the Precautionary Principle and Zero EmissionsStrategy 6.3.1 Adoption of the Precautionary Principle The precautionary principle acknowledges that, if further environmental degradation is to be minimised and reversed,precaution and prevention must be the overriding principlesof policy. It requires that the burden of proof should not belaid upon the protectors of the environment to demonstrateconclusive harm, but rather on the prospective polluter todemonstrate no likelihood of harm. The precautionary principle is now gaining acceptance internally as a foundation for strategies to protect the environment andhuman health (Stairs and Johnston 1991). Current regulation for incinerators is not based on the precautionary principle. Instead it attempts to set limits forthe discharge of chemicals into the environment which aredesignated as \"safe\". In the current regulatory system theburden of proof lies with those who need to 'prove' thathealth impacts exist before being able to attempt to removethe cause of the problem and not with the polluters themselves (Nicolopoulou-Stamati et al. 2000). Based on knowledge regarding the toxic effects of many environmental chemical pollutants, which has accumulatedover recent decades, a more legitimate viewpoint is that\"chemicals should be considered as dangerous until proven otherwise\". We have now reached a situation, and indeed did some time ago, where health studies on incineration have INCINERATION AND HUMAN HEAL TH 61reported associations between adverse health effects and residing near to incinerators or being employed at an incinerator. These studies are warning signs which shouldnot result in government inactivity, but rather to decisionsbeing taken which implement the precautionary principle.There is already sufficient human health and environmentalcontamination evidence to justify a phase out of the incineration process based on the precautionary principle.To wait for further proof from a new generation of incinerators from an already harmful and dirty technologywould be a blatant disregard for the environment and human health. 6.3.2 Adoption of Zero Discharge The aim of \"zero discharge\" is to halt environmental releases of all hazardous substances. Although it is sometimes discussed as being simplistic or even impossible, it is a goal whereby regulation can be seen asresting places on the way to achieving it (Sprague 1991). Zero discharge necessitates the adoption of clean production techniques both in industry and agriculture. It isessential that the change to clean production and materialuse should be fully supported by fiscal incentives andenforceable legislation. The principle of clean production has already been endorsed by the Governing Council of the UNEP and has received growing recognition at a wide range of international fora. For instance, the adoption of the one generation goal for the phase out of all hazardous substances by the OSPAR Convention in 1998 necessitatesinstigating clean production technology under a zero discharge strategy. In terms of waste management strategies, incineration is a dirty technology that can never fulfil the criteria of zero discharge. The way forward for waste management in line with a zero emissions strategy and hence towards sustainability, lies in waste prevention, re-use and recycling.In other words the adoption of the already well known principle of \"REDUCE, RE-USE AND RECYCLE\". 6.3.3 Implementation of REDUCE, RE-USE AND RECYCLE We live in a world in which our resources are generally not given the precious status by industry and agriculture whichthey deserve. In part, this has led to the creation, particularlyin industrialised countries, of a \"disposable society\" inwhich enormous quantities of waste, including \"avoidablewaste\" are generated. This situation needs to be urgentlychanged so that the amount of waste produced bothdomestically and by industry is drastically reduced. Ways to help waste reduction include the use of economic instruments and environmental taxes. The use of these measures is supported by the EC and a numberenvironmental taxes are already in place in several Europeancountries (Steenwegen 2000). However, far more action ispresently required to stimulate the change needed for muchmore waste reduction to become a reality. Current levels of recycling in European countries vary considerably. For instance, The Netherlands recycles 46% of municipal waste whereas the UK only manages 8%.Intensive re-use and recycling schemes could deal with80% of municipal waste. It is recognised that fiscal measures can play a considerable role in encouraging re-use and recycling schemes whilst discouraging leastdesirable practices such as incineration and landfill(Steenwegen 2000). Measures to be taken in the drive towards increased waste reduction, re-use and recycling, and therefore towards lessening the adverse health effects from waste management should include: The phase out of all forms of industrial incineration by 2020, including MSW incineration. This is in line with the OSPAR Convention for the phase out of emissions, losses and discharges of all hazardous substances by 2020. Financial and legal mechanisms to increase re-use of packaging (e.g. bottles, containers) and products (e.g. computer housings, electronic components). Financial mechanisms (such as the landfill tax) used directly to set up the necessary infrastructure for effective recycling. Stimulating markets for recycled materials by legal requirements for packaging and products, where appropriate, to contain minimum amounts of recycled materials. Materials that cannot be safely recycled or composted at the end of their useful life (for example PVC plastic) must be phased out and replaced with more sustainable materials. In the short term, materials and products that add to the generation of hazardous substances in incinerators mustbe prevented from entering the waste stream at the costof the producer. Such products would include electronicequipment, metals and products containing metals, suchas batteries and florescent lighting, and PVC plastics INCINERATION AND HUMAN HEAL TH62(vinyl flooring, PVC electrical cabling, PVC packaging, PVC-uwindow frames etc) and other products containing hazardous substances. and more generally: Further the development of clean production technologies which are more efficient in terms of material and energy usage, produce cleaner products with less wastes and which ultimately can operate in a \"closed loop\" configurations to serve the needs of society in a more equitable and sustainable manner; Implement fully the Precautionary Principle, such that, in the future, we may be better able to avoid problems before they occur. The continuation and further development of scientific research has a fundamental role to play in identification of potential problems and solutions, but we must be ready to take effective precautionary action to prevent environmental contamination and degradation even in the face of considerable and often irreducible uncertainties.INCINERATION AND HUMAN HEAL TH 637 .

INCINERATION AND HUMAN HEAL TH 69APPENDIX A HEALTH EFFECTS OF SPECIFIC POLLUTANTSEMITTED FROM INCINERATORS1 Particulate Matter 1.1 Introduction Animal and plant life as we know it evolved in the presence of particulate matter (Howard 2000). This matter consists ofminute particles, sometimes called particulates. Naturalsources of particulates include soil particles which areblown into the air by the wind, dusts from volcanic eruptions, particles of sea salt ejected into the air by breaking waves on the sea, spores from fungi and pollengrains from plants. These particles vary in size from thosecoarse-sized particles that are visible to the naked eye totiny microscopic particles, measured in micrometers (\u00b5m).The finer particles tend to remain airborne for long periodsof time whereas coarse particles, such as wind blown soil,and plant pollens, tend to fall rapidly and remain airbornefor only short periods of time. Most naturally produced particles are generally greater than 20 \u00b5m in size (QUARG1996, COMEAP 1995, EPAQS 1995). The human respiratory system has evolved to cope with an environmental loading of such naturally produced aerialparticles. The muco-cilary lining (mucus and fine hairs) ofthe airways operates to protect the deeper regions of thelung. Fine particles of less than 10 \u00b5m do occur naturally,mainly in the form of re-suspended sea salts. In this form,the fine particulates pose no threat to health and, if inhaled,are simply absorbed into the body (Howard 2000). Particulates are also formed as a consequence of human activities. When humans started to use fire domestically,exposure to fine insoluble particles of material, less than 10\u00b5m in size, must have occurred on a regular basis (Howard2000). However, the advent of industrialized society hasseen a vast increase in the level of industrial combustionprocesses around the world. The major source of man-made particles arises from combustion processes such as incineration of wastes, coal-burning and vehicle exhausts and to a lesser extentfrom metallurgical and other industrial processes. All ofthese processes inevitably result in the direct emission ofparticles into the atmosphere. Such particles which aredirectly emitted into the atmosphere are called primary particles. Furthermore, as well as this direct emission of particles from combustion processes, some pollutant gaseswhich are released from combustion processes, such assulphur dioxide and nitrogen dioxide, undergo chemicalreactions in the atmosphere in which particles (known assecondary particles) are also formed. These particles aremainly comprised of ammonium sulphate and ammoniumnitrate. Secondary particles can also have a wide variety of other toxic organic compounds adsorbed onto their surfaces such as PAHs (QUARG 1996, COMEAP 1995,EPAQS 1995).Particulates formed from human activities are generally fine particles (less than 10 \u00b5m) and even smaller ultrafineparticles (less than 0.05 \u00b5m i.e. 50 nanometers (nm) insize). There is much scientific evidence which indicates thatthat particles less than 10 \u00b5m, have adverse effects uponthe human health. Most notably, the most recent views anddata suggest that it is the number of ultrafine particles, andpossibly their chemical composition, which causes healthimpacts (QUARG 1996, Seaton et al. 1995). Ultrafine particles may be acidic in nature and an irritant to the lungs or carry toxic substances on their surface such ashalogenated organic materials, including dioxins, metals and PAHs (COMEAP 1995). The respiratory system has mechanisms to expel particulates to protect the deep lung regions. Naturally produced particles are generally of sizes 2.5 to 10 \u00b5m orlarger. All particles below 10 \u00b5m may reach the furthestparts of the lungs but, in general, those particles sizedbetween 2.5 and 10 \u00b5m are most likely to be deposited in the upper airways of the lungs. From here they are efficiently removed. Only a small fraction of naturally produced particles will be deposited in the deepest regionsof the lungs. The body does have mechanisms which clearparticles from the deep parts of the lungs, although they areless efficient than in the upper airways. However, unlikenatural particles, a high proportion of particulates fromindustrial combustion processes are less than 2.5 \u00b5m in size. These \"respirable\" particles can reach and bedeposited in the deep regions of the lungs and are thought to have the most significant impacts on health. While it is recognized that there would have been naturally and man-made combustion processes in the pre-industrialage, the level of particulate production would have beenvery small by comparison with today. Recent studies in theUK, estimated that primary and secondary particles derivedfrom industry each constitute about a third of the totalPM10 burden in air, with the remaining third coming frommarine aerosol (see Howard 2000). Differences in the levelsof particulates in air are clearly influenced by local sources.For instance, a study in the city of Birmingham, UK, showedthat the number of particles present in urban air ranged from 1000 to 100,000 particles per cm 3. Rural air contained lower numbers of particles, averaging 5000 to 10,000 per cm3but rose when influenced by nearby traffic. Less polluted air such as that over the North Atlantic Ocean typically contains around 200 particles per cm3 (QUARG 1996, Seaton 1995). Since the size of particles has a direct bearing on health impacts, measurements made in recent years havequantified particles in the atmosphere according to size. The most commonly used measurement is known as PM10,which estimates the mass of particles in air which are less INCINERATION AND HUMAN HEAL TH70INCINERATION AND HUMAN HEAL TH 71than 10 um in diameter. PM10 reflects the size of particles which are considered to be most likely depositedin the lung. It has been used to quantify particulate concentrations in many studies on health impacts of particulate air pollution. 1.2 Health Effects of Particulates From the 1930s to the 1950s there were a series of severe air pollution disasters in industrialized cities includingLondon, Meuse Valley Belgium and Donora, Pennsylvania.Dense winter smogs, caused by particulate pollution andsulphur dioxide from coal combustion, resulted in substantial increases in the death rate from respiratory andcardiovascular diseases. These incidents proved that highlevels of particulate air pollution in smog caused anincrease in daily death rate (see Schwartz 1994a). Suchincidents became a thing of the past by the 1960s in western industrialized countries, due to changes in thetypes of fuel and better pollution control. The nature of airpollution also changed as a result of increases in vehicleemissions. Since the mid-1980s, much research has beencarried out to determine whether the lower levels of particulates and other air pollutants to which populationsare exposed nowadays also cause an increase in death rate and disease. It has been shown by many human epidemiology studies on this subject that particulate pollution is indeed linked to worsening respiratory diseasesand increasing premature mortality from respiratory andheart diseases (see Pope et al. 1995a). Studies on short-term fluctuations in the level of air pollution in a region and the daily death rate of the regionhave consistently found that small elevations in the dailydeath rates are associated with short-term increases in particulate air pollution (e.g. see Pope et al. 1995a, Schwartz 1994a). Importantly, these studies have notrevealed a \"safe level\" of particulates, that is a threshold,below which the death rate did not increase. Thus, theassociation between increasing mortality with increasingparticulate pollution was apparent in studies even in areaswhere air pollution was relatively low and was well withinUS air quality standards. It was estimated from the study data that for every 10 mg/m 3increase in PM10 there was an associated 0.5-1.5% increase in daily mortality. The premature deaths were due mainly to an increase in deathsfrom respiratory diseases and secondarily from cardiovascular diseases. Researchers have reviewed the studies and concluded that it is unlikely the observedincreased death rates were due to confounding factors thatcould also affect the death rate such as weather conditionsor other air pollutants. It has therefore been suggested thatit is reasonable to interpret results from the studies asshowing a causal relationship between PM10 and dailymortality (e.g. Pope et al. 1995a, Schwartz 1994a).In addition to research on short-term changes in particulate pollution and mortality rates, studies have also been conducted on the effect of exposure to long-term air pollution on mortality. These studies compared the annualaverage mortality rates of populations living in differentareas, with the annual average concentrations of air pollution in those areas. They again revealed an associationbetween particulate pollution and increased mortality. Deathrates were found to be higher in cities with higher levels offine or sulphate particulate pollution than those with lowerlevels. In fact, results showed that between 3 and 9% of allurban deaths appeared to be due to particulate air pollution(Pope et al. 1995b). Since this figure is so high, these studies have come under criticism for inadequate control of confounding factors. However, two further studies whichovercame the problem of confounding (Pope et al. 1995c, Dockery et al. 1993), including one study on a 8-year follow up of over half a million US adults (Pope et al. 1995c), also found that average long-term levels of fine particulate andsulphate air particulate pollution were linked with mortality.The risk of mortality was about 15-25% higher in cities withthe highest particulate pollution compared to cities with the lowest levels. The causes of death associated with particulate pollution were respiratory diseases, includinglung cancer, and cardiovascular diseases, particularlyamongst the chronically ill or elderly. Therefore, studies onboth short-term changes in air pollution, and long-term levels of air pollution have indicated an association betweenmortality and particulate air pollution. If the relationship between particulate pollution and mortality is causal, then it would be expected that morbidity(ill-health) would also be associated with particulate pollution levels (Pope et al. 1995b). This is indeed the case. Many studies have been conducted using a variety of endpoints to monitor health effects and have found anassociation between short-term changes in particulate airpollution and illness. The results are illustrated in the list ofbullet points given below. Overall, these studies suggestthat particulate pollution is able to cause temporary worsening of already existing respiratory illnesses. Particulate air pollution has been associated with: Increase in hospital admissions for respiratory illness in winter (e.g. Schwartz 1994a, Pope 1991, Pope 1989) and in summer (e.g. Schwartz 1994a b, c and d, Thurston et al. 1993). Increase in hospital emergency department visits for respiratory diseases (see Pope 1995a, e.g. Schwartz et al. 1993, Sunyer et al. 1993). Exacerbation of mild and severe asthma attacks in adults and children (e.g. Pope et al. 1995b, Walters et al. 1994, Ostro 1993, Roemer et al. 1993, Thurston et al. 1993, Pope 1989, Bates and Sizto 1987, Whittemore and Korn 1980). Increase in respiratory symptoms (particularly lower respiratory symptoms, such as wheezing, dry cough, phlegm, shortness of breath, chest discomfort/pain), (e.g. Sram et al. 1996, Schwartz et al. 1994b, Braun-Fahrlander et al. 1992, Pope and Dockery 1992). Small decreases in lung function (e.g. Hoek and Brunekreef 1994 and 1993, Koenig et al. 1993, Neas et al. 1992, Pope and Dockery 1992, Pope et al. 1991, Dassen et al. 1986, Dockery et al. 1982). Work and school absenteeism through ill health (Sram et al. 1996, Ransom and Pope 1991, Ostro 1990, Ostro and Rothschild 1989). Results of epidemiology studies discussed in this section provide evidence that day-to-day variations in current airparticulate concentrations are associated with transienteffects on health and increases in the daily death rate. This has provoked a great deal of controversy. Critics have argued that results were artefactual and contrary tocommon sense and established doctrine. However, a number of independent experts have also reviewed the evidence and have suggested that the associations arecausal. This view has been accepted by the UK Department of Health (Maynard 2000). In addition to transient health effects due to short-term changes in particulate air pollution, research has also beenconducted to investigate whether long-term exposure to particulate pollution over one year or more has any long-lasting or cumulative effects on health. Several studieshave showed an association. For example, some studiesfound an association with reduced lung function (e.g. Sram et al. 1996, Chestnut et al. 1991, Schwartz 1989) and increased respiratory symptoms especially bronchitis(Abbey et al. 1995, see Pope et al. 1995b). In sum, epidemiology data indicates that the link between fine particulate pollution and adverse effects on health ismost likely causal (see e.g. Pope 1995b, COMEAP 1995).Less is known about the mechanisms by which particulatesimpact on health. Presently, it is thought that ultrafine, possibly acidic particles could cause inflammation of tissue in the lung extremities which in turn may provokerespiratory and heart related illnesses and death (e.g.Seaton 1995, see Howard 2000 and 2000b). Researchsuggests that it may be the smallness of ultrafine particlesthemselves, their high surface area for the release of transition metals, their insolubility and their possible generation of free radicals which may be the most important factors contributing to make the particle cause inflammation (Donaldson et al. 2000).2. Dioxins Dioxins are toxic, persistent in the environment and they are bioaccumulative, i.e., they build up in the tissues of animals and humans alike. Dioxins are the unintented by-products of human activities that involve the manufacture and use of elemental chlorine and the combustion of materials that contain any form of chlorine.Dioxin levels in the populations and environments of industrialised regions began increasing markedly followingWorld War II, with the manufacture and dispersal of chlorinated pesticides and other chemicals and their associated wastes. By the late 1970s and early 1980s, some scientists were beginning to recognize that dioxins were ubiquitous in thepopulations and environments of industrialised regions.Moreover, they discovered that waste incinerators werereleasing dioxins in their stack gases and ashes. By thistime, however, the technology was well entrenched. Oncepolicymakers were finally convinced of the widespreadnature of the dioxin problem and its link to incineration,some regions had come to depend on incineration, both asa waste disposal option as well as an economic enterprisefor the industrial sector. As a consequence, these regionshave become even more heavily invested in incinerator control technologies. Unfortunately, these methods primarily change the nature of the dioxin problem but donot solve it. i.e., a larger share of the dioxins that were oncereleased into the air are captured in stack filters or in bottom ashes and placed in landfills. This will retard thedispersal of dioxins into the environment but will not, in thelong-term, prevent it. Dioxin contamination is not restricted to the local areas surrounding incinerators and other sources. Like other persistent organic pollutants, they are transported for thousands of kilometres on air currents and have consequently become globally ubiquitous pollutants. It is thought that every man, woman and child on the planet now carries dioxins in their body tissues. The toxicology of dioxins, in particular TCDD, has been extensively researched. A considerable amount of work has also been put into conducting research on wildlife and human health effects of dioxin exposure. TCDD was recently classified as a human carcinogen by the International Agency for Research on Cancer (McGregor et al. 1998). Dioxins exert a plethora of toxic effects because they act on a fundamental biochemical regulation system in thebody, a system that is common to animals and humans.Dioxins exert their effects through binding to the \"Ah receptor\", the outcome of which affects several genes(Webster and Commoner 1994). Their toxicological effects are summarised in table 1. INCINERATION AND HUMAN HEAL TH72INCINERATION AND HUMAN HEAL TH 73Occupational studies have reported that exposure to dioxin has been associated with a wide range of effects includingchloracne (skin lesions), changes in the levels of liverenzymes, changes in the levels of thyroid hormones, sexhormones, and cells of the immune system (reviewed bySweeney and Mocarelli 2000). Exposure to dioxins in theworkplace has also been associated with an increased riskof cancer when all cancers together are considered (eg.Fingerhut et al. 1991, Manz et al. 1991, Zorber et al. 1990). For the general population of industrialised countries, research indicates that dioxins are exerting effects on people at current background levels found in the environment. For instance, dioxins can affect the levels of certain hormones, enzymes and immune system cells, at body concentrations at, or near to, the levels currentlyfound in the human populations of industrialised countries.According to DeVito et al. 1995: \"Subtle changes in enzyme activity indicating liver changes in levels of circulating reproductive hormones in males, in reduced glucose tolerance potentially indicative of risk of diabetes, and in cellular changes related to immunefunction suggest the potential for adverse impacts onhuman metabolism, reproductive biology, and immunecompetence at or within one order of magnitude of averagebackground body burden levels... Individuals at the highend of the general population range may be experiencingsome of these effects. Some more highly exposed members of the population may be at risk for franklyadverse effects including developmental toxicity, reduced reproductive capacity based on decreased sperm countsand potential for increased fetal death, higher probability of experiencing endometriosis, reduced ability to withstandan immunological challenge and others.\" Intake of dioxins in the diet of populations in Europe is frequently in excess of the tolerable daily intake (TDI) set by WHO (1-4 pg ITEQ/kg/day), particularly when dioxin-likePCBs are included (WHO 1998, see Allsopp et al. 2000). WHO experts acknowledged that subtle effects on healthmay already be occurring in the general population and thatefforts should be made to ensure that intakes are at thelower end of the TDI range. Intake by breast-fed infants is very high compared with the TDI. This is of particularconcern because the developing stages of life are most vulnerable to toxic insult from such chemicals. Studies carried out during the past decade in the Netherlands have investigated the impacts of current background levels of dioxins and PCBs on foetal development, during infancy and childhood. Healthywomen from the general population were selected for these studies. Results have revealed undesirable impacts on health of the immune system and nervous system during development that are associated with exposure to dioxins and PCBs during development. For instance, some of the women had higher levels of PCBs and dioxins in their bodies and breast milk than others.

It isnot known what effect such changes could have on theirhealth (Weisglas-Kuperus et al. 1995). Regarding effects on the nervous system, there was a slight adverse effect onpsychomotor development in infants who were exposed tohigher levels of PCBs and dioxins in the womb and duringbreastfeeding (Koopman-Esseboom et al. 1995). There was also a slight adverse effect on neurological development inthe children detected at 18 months of age. Tests on neurological development looked at movement co-ordination, (eg. sitting, crawling, standing and walking), and are a way of measuring the quality and integrity ofbrain function (Huisman et al. 1995). At the age of 2 years and 7 months, tests on a subgroup of infants found slightchanges in some measures of neurological development in the more highly exposed individuals. These changeswere regarded as \"unwanted\" by researchers, and it wasproposed that they could be due to the action of dioxins on thyroid hormones during development (Ilsen et al. 1996). A summary of the effects of perinatal exposure to dioxins and PCBs is presented in Table 2. Central nervous system Immune system Growth, sexual development and reproductive healthDelayed cognitive development, mildly disordered behavior, and increased activity in children of mothers who were accidentally exposed to extraordinary levels of dioxins/PCBs.

Lower weight at birth and continued diminished height and weight at school age amongchildren whose mothers had extraordinaryl exposure. Reduced penis length among boys who were conceived in the earliest years after theirmothers had extraordinary exposure. Altered birthweight and gestational age among infants of mothers who had occupationalexposure to PCBs. Lower birthweight and smaller head circumference among infants of mothers whose dietsincluded fish from the Great Lakes.More frequent ear infections and altered levels of certain cells that have roles in warding off diseases in Inuit infants whose mothers had elevated exposure through their diet of traditional foods. Altered levels of certain cells involved in resisting diseases among children whose mothershad background exposures.Table 2: Effects of Perinatal Exposure to Dioxins and PCBs on Infants and Children INCINERATION AND HUMAN HEAL TH 753. Heavy Metals 3.1 Lead Lead has no known nutritional biochemical or physiological function (Goyer 1996). The toxic effects of lead are thesame, irrespective of whether it is ingested or inhaled, andblood levels less than10-100 mg/dl in children, and 10-100mg/dl in adults have been associated with a wide range ofadverse effects. These include nervous system disorders,anaemia and decreased haemoglobin synthesis, cardiovascular disease, and disorders in bone metabolism,renal function and reproduction. Of particular concern, is the effect of relatively low exposure on cognitive andbehavioural development in children (Pirkle et al. 1998, USPHS 1997, Bernard et al. 1995, Goyer 1993, Nriagu 1988). It is clear that increased body burden of lead resultsin decreased scores on measures of intelligence from earlyinfancy through school age. It also results in effects on behaviour of school children, including increased distractibility, short attention span and impulsivity (Rice 1996). In 1975 the Centre for Disease control (CDC) in Atlanta recommended that the maximum permissible level ofblood-lead be 30 ug/dl (for both adults and children). Thislevels was revised downward in 1985 to 25 ug/dl, andagain in 1991, defining a blood-lead of 10 ug/l as an actionor intervention level (USPHS 1997). Perhaps even moreimportantly is the now suggested recommendation thatthere may be no level of blood-lead that does not producea toxic effect, particularly in the developing central nervoussystem (USPHS 1997, Goyer 1993). 3.2 Cadmium Cadmium has no biochemical or nutritional function, and it is highly toxic to both plants and animals (USPHS 1997,WHO 1992, Alloway 1990). In humans and animals, there isstrong evidence that the kidney is the main target organ ofcadmium toxicity, following extended exposure (USPHS1997, Elinder and Jarup 1996, Goyer 1996, Roels et al. 1993, Iwata et al. 1993, WHO 1992, Mueller et al. 1992). Renal damage includes tubular proteinuria (the excretion oflow molecular weight proteins) and a decrease in theglomerular filtration rate. The latter results in a depressedre-sorption of enzymes, amino acids, glucose, calcium, copper, and inorganic phosphate. Furthermore, studies haveshown that even when cadmium exposure ceases, proteinuria does not decrease, and renal tubular dysfunction and reduced glomerular filtration increase inseverity (USPHS 1997, Elinder and Jarup 1996, Goyer1996, Iwata et al. 1993, WHO 1992, Nriagu 1988). Other toxic effects of cadmium, based on findings from occupation, animal, and epidemiological studies, can besummarised as follows: Case studies indicate that calcium deficiency, osteoporosis, or osteomalacia (softening of the bones) can develop insome workers after long-term occupational exposure tohigh levels of cadmium. A progressive disturbance in therenal metabolism of vitamin D and an increased urinaryexcretion of calcium is often seen, suggesting that bonechanges may be secondary to disruption in kidney vitaminD and calcium metabolism (USPHS 1997, Goyer et al. 1994, WHO 1992). In the Jinzu River Basin, a cadmium-contaminated area in Japan, a cadmium inducedskeletal disorder known as Itai-Itai disease disabled manychildren born to women of middle age and poor nutrition(Alloway 1996). The inhalation of high levels of cadmium oxide fumes or dust is intensely irritating to respiratory tissue, and acute high-level exposures can be fatal. Typical non-fatalsymptoms can include severe tracheobronchitis, pneumonitis, and pulmonary oedema, developwithin hours of exposure (USPHS 1997b, Goyer 1996,WHO 1992). At lower levels, lung inflammation have beenknown to cause emphysema (swelling of the lung air sacsresulting in breathlessness) and dyspnoea (difficult andlaboured breathing) (USPHS 1997, Goyer 1996, WHO1992). Animal studies have confirmed that inhalation exposure to cadmium leads to respiratory injury (USPHS1997b, WHO 1992). There have been a number of epidemiological studies intended to determine a relationship between occupational(respiratory) exposure to cadmium and lung and prostaticcancer, and these along with animal studies have providedconsiderable support for the carcinogenic potential of cadmium (Goyer 1996). Cadmium and certain cadmiumcompounds are therefore listed by the International Agencyfor Research on Cancer (IARC) as carcinogenic. The USDepartment of Health and Human Services in its 8th Reporton Carcinogens, lists cadmium and certain cadmium Growth, sexual development and reproductive health Thyroid functionLower birthweight and slower postnatal growth until 3 months of age among infants whose mothers had background exposure. Subtle alterations in levels of thyroid hormones in pregnant mothers and their infantsexposed to background levels of PCBs and dioxins.INCINERATION AND HUMAN HEAL TH76compounds as Reasonably Anticipated to be Human Carcinogens (USPHS 1998). In addition to these toxic effects, it has also been suggested that cadmium may play a role in the development of hypertension (high blood pressure) and heart disease(USPHS 1997, Goyer 1996, Elinder and Jarup 1996). It isalso known that severe oral exposure can result in severeirritation to the gastrointestinal epithelium, nausea, vomiting,salivation, abdominal pain, cramps and diarrhoea (USPHS 1997b). 3.3 Mercury Mercury is an extremely toxic, non-essential trace metal, having no biochemical or nutritional function. Biologicalmechanisms for its removal are poor, and, mercury is the only metal known to biomagnify, that is, progressively accumulate as it passes though the food chain (WHO 1989). Acute inhalation of high levels of mercury vapour may cause nausea, vomiting, diarrhoea, increases in blood pressure or heart rate, skin rashes, eye irritation, corrosivebronchitis and pneumonitis. And, if not fatal, may be associated with central nervous system (CNS) effects suchas tremor or increased excitability (USPHS 1997, Goyer1996). With chronic exposure, the major effects are on the CNS (tremor, spasms, loss of memory, increasedexcitability, severe depression, personality changes, evendelirium and hallucination), although renal damage, associated with chronically exposed workers, has also beenshown (Ratcliffe et al. 1996, Goyer 1996). These effectshave also been reported in animal studies (USPHS 1997) Acute exposure to high levels of mercury salts, or chronic low-dose exposure, is directly toxic to the kidney (Zalupsand Lash 1994). In addition, nausea and diarrhoea mayresult after swallowing large amounts of inorganic mercurysalts, and some nervous system effects have also beenrecorded (USPHS 1997, WHO 1989). Once metallic mercury has entered the environment it can be methylated by micro-organisms, found for instance inaquatic sediments, to organic forms of mercury, most commonly methylmercury. In this form, it is able to crosscell membranes easily and quickly enters the aquatic foodchain. From here it may enter the human food chain.Exposure to methylmercury has resulted in permanent damage to the CNS, kidneys, and the developing foetus. The levels of methylmercury that result in these effects arenot usually encountered by the general population, howeverthey were encountered by the population of Minamata, inJapan, who were exposed to high levels of methylmercuryfrom eating contaminated fish and seafood collected fromthe Bay (USPHS 1997). Symptoms such as brain damage,numbness of extremities, and paralysis, along with the loss of hearing, speech and sight were reported (D'Itri1991). However even today, the full range of neurologicalsymptoms caused by the ingestion of methylmercury in fishand shellfish has not been fully characterised, and the totalnumber of Minamata Disease sufferers has not been determined (D'Itri 1991). Furthermore, whilst only theJapanese cases have been confirmed as MinamataDisease, other populations in Canada (from chlor-alkali discharges) and Brazil (from gold mining) are potentially at risk. The problem of methylation of past and presentinorganic mercury discharges continues, and the long retention time of mercury by sediments delays the elimination of contamination for many years (Harada 1997,Akagi et al. 1995, Bryan and Langston 1992, D'Itri 1991).INCINERATION AND HUMAN HEAL TH 77References for D.E., Ostro B.E., Petersen F. and Burchette R.J.
