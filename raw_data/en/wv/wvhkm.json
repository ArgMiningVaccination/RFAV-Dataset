Countries and GPEI partn ers must stop transmission of poliovirus within 120 days of confirmation of any new outbreak. Both wild poliovi rus (WPV) and vaccine-derived polioviruses (VDPVs) can cause clinical illness, including acute flaccid par alysis (AFP), and outbreaks. 1 The Emergency Committee (EC) for polio, convened un der the International Health Regulations (IHR), continues to monitor both WPV and VDPVs with height ened concern. VDPVs capable of causing paralysis continue to emerge and circulate. To respond to thi s threat, the IHR EC has included circulating VDPV (cVDPV) polioviruses in their remit for monitoring action and progress. cVDPVs are a particular risk i n under-immunized populations. The continued use of o ral polio vaccine (OPV) type 2 component (OPV2) is responsible for most cVDPV cases and outbreaks. The outbreak response for cVDPV follows the same principles as for WPV. In response to the increased concerns of VDPV-related outbreaks, the May 2014 WHA endorsed a strategy to reduce the risk associat ed with attenuated poliovirus (Sabin strains) used in oral polio vaccine (OPV). The GPEI Standard Operating Procedures (SOPs) recom mend that supplemental immunization activities be implemented within 14 days of identification of a p oliovirus that requires an immunization response, f or each type of isolate. GPEI must fulfil six critical functions in support of an event or outbreak respo nse: event/ outbreak confirmation, grading, response assessment and closure; and advocacy; technical and human resources; information management; extern al communication, social mobilization and behaviour change communication; and finances and lo gistics. Response must be built upon a deep understanding of community needs, positive attitude s and behaviours of parents to agree to give their children the vaccine repeatedly. This set of C4D po lio outbreak response guidelines updates earlier standards issued in October 2015. The C4D guideline s are based on the UNICEF's 2015 Global Polio Communicate Guide and April 2016 SOP. A. COMMUNICATIONS FOR DEVELOPMENT (C4D) FRAMEWORK C4D for Polio is a systematic, planned and evidence -based strategic process that aims to promote posit ive and measurable social and behavioural change for ma ximum coverage of OPV. It relies on a foundation th at social and behavioural change is rooted in local co ntext, as well as the consultation and participatio n of children, families, communities and networks. These principles also apply to communication in a polio response, though the process must be accelerated fo r an outbreak context. 1 GEPI 2016. 4 Previous polio communications strategies commonly targeted individual caregivers with facts about polio and polio vaccination. The new polio strategy is specifically designed to address the dynamic perceptions and social norms that deter caregivers from vaccinating their children. It builds on the critical first step in any outbreak of raising awareness, and urgency but also goes beyond this to establish a strategic emphasis on building trust for health workers and the vaccination services they bring. In all phases of an outbreak, our communications must address each of the decision points in this diagram. These factors together will determine whether or not a caregiver decides to give their child repeated doses of OPV. The Polio C4D response is based on the Social Ecological Model (SEM) developed and used by UNICEF to understand and address norms that influence individual and collective behaviours, such as the acceptance or rejection of the polio vaccine and the vaccinator who delivers the vaccine. The SEM model (as depicted in the diagram below) should be used to develop a comprehensive plan to engage with all actors who wi ll ultimately influence a parent's decision to vacc inate repeatedly. During the development of your outbreak response plan, it will be important to consider re levant interventions at all of the framework's levels. Uti lizing a multi-faceted approach will help ensure communities and decision-makers at local, national, and regional levels are engaged in dialogue toward promoting vaccination. The polio outbreak communica tions strategy has two distinct phases: Immediate Response Communications (IRC) and Adaptive Phase Co mmunications (APC). Immediate Response Communications (IRC) Immediate Response Communications is employed immed iately after an outbreak is declared and focuses on building (or rebuilding) caregivers' critical aw areness about polio, OPV, and fact that there is an urgent outbreak in a local community that puts children at risk. At the beginning of an outbreak, the goal is immediate mass response to communicate to the popul ation about the outbreak, the planned response to the outbreak, information about polio and the vacci ne, and the health workers who will administer deli very 5 of the vaccine. Within the immediate response phase , communications should be straightforward, clear, and illicit an urgent response from parents and the community at large. The primary goal is to raise awareness of the outbreak, the disease, the vaccine , vaccination dates, and the response to a threshol d of at least 90% awareness as quickly as possible. Adaptive Phase Communications (APC) Adaptive Phase Communications (APC) begins once the awareness threshold has been achieved. This could be after one month or up to four months, depending on the local context. In this phase, communications will shift to more closely supporting the goal of r eaching missed children. Communications will addres s social barriers and opportunities for promoting vac cination, and will leverage these, respectively, th rough our communications and engagement approach. Uncover ing these barriers requires research and analysis of caregivers and their knowledge, attitudes, and p ractices about polio that should be conducted as IR C progresses. As barriers are identified, new communi cations will be required to address them. The APC lasts until the outbreak is concluded. B. PHASE I- IMMEDIATE RESPONSE COMMUNICATION: 24 HOURS TO ONE MONTH B.1 Epidemiological and social investigation As soon as a notification is made, a critical first step is to conduct an epidemiological and social i nvestigation of the infected case. This joint investigation is undertak en between MOH, UNICEF and WHO and aims to rapidly assess the management, operational, and social environment in the area affected by the virus. This tool includes an assessment at community, sub-district and district level. UNIC EF is generally responsible for the community asses sment, but also participates in each part of the assessment. If UNI CEF is unable to attend the assessment, WHO and MOH team must 6 ensure filling out the social investigation compone nt of the form. Direct observation and interviews i n the local area can quickly lead to meaningful insights about the f amily and the affected community 2. If feasible, it's important to review existing data of knowledge, attitudes, pract ices and behaviour (KAPB) surveys, or conduct a rap id assessment, to learn about the social norms that can affect vac cination. Such reviews should be done in parallel, in order to initiate the response quickly. B.2 Media response in a polio outbreak context Monitoring and engaging with different forms of med ia is critical from the onset of the case. Media ca n pick up the confirmation of polio virus and disseminate it in a n unproductive manner if not well-managed. The Mini stry of Health, with WHO, will always be the first to announce an o utbreak, and they should take the lead in this area . You should immediately establish which agency is leading in th e Media response: WHO or UNICEF. This leadership ro le will depend on capacity in each country, but generally U NICEF leads the media response in addition to the C 4D response. However, irrespective of which agency leads, there should be close collaboration and consultation betw een the two agencies and RO and HQ levels of the two organizati ons. Joint teleconferences to establish the media s trategy should be initiated immediately by the leading agency. To effectively manage the media response, it would be important to ensure thorough understanding of th e media landscape and media influencers by closely monitori ng coverage about the outbreak and its tonality. Su bsequently, a list of media reporters that cover health, as well as programs with high viewership and listenership s hould be developed, and continuous communication should be m aintained with them to build trust. Ensure the prog ramme and UNICEF have spokespeople identified who have the ca pacity to work with media, who send the right messa ge about ownership and the 'public face' of the response, an d who are media-trained. B.3 Understanding the communication landscape It will be important to conduct a thorough communic ations landscape assessment that will help to make the right choices about which communication tactics to employ . This includes information on media consumption pa tterns (TV, radio, press, outdoor, transit, social media, magaz ines, etc.); highly viewed / listened-to programs a nd channels; influential media personnel who are \"public social leaders\" and can help the polio cause; available so cial mobilization committees at national and subnational levels; avai lable community engagement networks in the country, especially in high-risk areas, as well as their readiness and capacity to be deployed...etc. B.4 Coordination of communication interventions Creating or reinvigorating a national communication or social mobilization taskforce is critical, star ting with the early days of the outbreak. In many contexts, the Nationa l Interagency Coordination Committee (ICC) for immu nization can create or activate an existing Social Mobilization Committee (SMC). 3 The role of the SMC is to plan, coordinate and ensure the successful implementation and management of media and C4D interventions to support suppleme ntary immunization activities and routine immunization. T he SMC should meet regularly throughout the outbrea k and should be represented on the ICC or another managem ent taskforce created by the GPEI/MOH. It should al so regularly report on key milestones. The SMC and coordination mechanisms above it should be applied to sub-nation al level to improve the response all the way to the lowest peri pheral level. Either way, external communications a nd social mobilization should always be joined up and underta ken through a cohesive strategic approach. B.5 Communication for development within the nation al outbreak response plan The SOPs require deploying a GPEI team, as soon as an outbreak is confirmed in any country, to support the response. Once the outbreak is assessed and all available dat a and capacity reviewed, the GPEI team initiates th e development of a comprehensive plan that includes C4D. Within t he C4D plan, you will need to include the following components: 2 The methodology for special investigation tools to identify reasons for missed children is included in Annex 1 3Adapted from Communication Handbook for Polio Eradi cation and Routine EPI, Annex 8 (UNICEF/WHO/Polio P artners, November 2000), and Briefing Guide on Planning, Management and Implemen tation of Communication for EPI/NID, Annex 1, DR Co ngo (UNICEF, March 2000). 7 B.5.I Communication objectives and indicators While it will be important to indicate expected cha nges in knowledge, attitudes, practices and behaviour (KAPB) of the targeted group, it is equally important to l ink the communication objectives to the programme indicators the full campaign response aims to achie ve. For example, the communication objectives shoul d reflect how the C4D interventions would achieve som e of the following: /checkbld Proportion of children missed due to refusal or abs ence in high risk districts among all targeted children during last SIA is minimal. /checkbld Percent of caregivers aware of polio campaigns prio r to the arrival of vaccinators especially in high risk districts during last SIA is maximized. /checkbld Percent of high risk districts where the district-l evel micro-plans incorporate the minimum required social data and sending a complete communication an d social mobilization reports from last campaign is high. /checkbld Percent of districts where IPC training for Social Mobilizers and Vaccinators has been conducted during the last 2 months. B.5.II Audience analysis It is important to segment the audience into primar y and secondary groups. The audience analysis shoul d also include a list of stakeholders or people who can be mobilized to support the programme, or with whom it is important to advocate to get their support. These may include religious and community leaders; teachers; and/or youth volunteers. It is also vital to analyz e the barriers that can block triggering the decisi on by the target audience. Some of these barriers can be soci al, access or related to the service. In the contex t of polio outbreaks, and based on analysis of different count ry and regional experiences, the target audience ma y fall under one of the following categories: 1. Acceptors 2. Vulnerable acceptors 3. Rejectors 4. Transient Acceptors represent the majority of a typical country's popu lation. They are motivated to vaccinate their children since they accept vaccines. They trust the health care workers and system, and are aware of t he risk of polio as an implication of non-vaccination. This group also has the self-efficacy to accept the vac cine, even in a situation where there are rumors or waves of r efusals at the community levels. Vulnerable Acceptors may lapse in acceptance over time. They could be m oderately accepting immunization and the service. However, in the case of anti-vacci ne rumours or a community push towards refusals for some other reason, they may become rejectors. Rejectors are usually a minority of the population. But they often cluster in communities that provide a supportive social and cultural environment for thei r disbeliefs and suspicions about immunization serv ices, vaccine safety, or the value of vaccination. Reject ors may not always be caregivers. They may be influ ential community leaders or members, or even vaccinators w ho are not fully convinced that what they are promoting is right. 4 Transient populations are on the move, whether because they h ave been displaced from their homes or are traveling for livelihood or other reasons. For thos e who are on the move and are not able to go to a p ermanent vaccination point, the program organizes transit va ccination points. To support this effort, targeted communication is usually carried out for a limited time. B.5.III Developing key messages and materials As a principle, existing relevant materials should be the first place to start. Some can be reproduced , with 4 Polio Communication Global Guide. UNICEF NYHQ. 201 6. 8 modifications to adapt to the new outbreak event. S hould additional new materials be needed, all new C4D materials or production should be linked to the ove rall strategic objectives identified in the C4D str ategy. There are three principles that all polio materials and communications seek to adhere to 5: 1. Understand and leverage social perceptions, norms, and beliefs related to polio and polio vaccination. 2. Humanize health workers by emphasizing their social and emotional depth. 3. Continuously refine communications to maintain auth enticity and credibility for the target audience(s) B.5.IV Strategic channel mix and activities in polio o utbreak 6 Various communication channels should be used in a polio outbreak context. The choice depends on sever al factors. For example, patterns of media consumption ; reach and penetration of different media form; pr ofile of audience; and cost may be considered alongside o ther factors. It is important to use a well-balance d media mix that is cost effective and has the broadest rea ch. Communication channels most often used in outbr eak contexts include: mass media; interpersonal community outreach networks; community folk media; and IEC materials. During the Immediate Response Communication phase, the following key C4D activities could be possible to undertake: /checkbld Communicating the importance, safety, and efficacy of vaccination from the onset will dispel potential campaign-threatening rumors. /checkbld Analyze existing Knowledge, Attitudes, and Practice s (KAP) study data regarding vaccines, immunization service, and polio to guide message de velopment. /checkbld Inform the target population about polio, the vacci ne, and the health workers who will provide support to vulnerable children. /checkbld Activate social and community mobilizers in the hig hest risk areas. /checkbld Analyze the media landscape to identify how to quic kly reach the largest number of people as possible within the target population. /checkbld Frame the vaccination effort and health workers as heroic and mission-driven to create a supportive environment for the campaign. Meanwhile, during the Adaptive Phase Communications , the following are some of the key actions that ar e important to consider: /checkbld Identify population unreached or under-reached by p revious communications. /checkbld Retarget and refine communications to said populati ons. /checkbld Shift communications to address the root causes of refusals and access issues, as identified through KAPs data. /checkbld Begin targeting and addressing harmful social perce ptions and norms. /checkbld Identify and capitalize on previous communication s uccesses. /checkbld Close the loop by creating means for caregivers of missed and absent children to get in touch with UNICEF/other parties directly in order to get the v accine. /checkbld Shift from an emphasis on the individual consequenc es of polio to the importance of community protection and social action. /checkbld Continue to support social and community mobilizati on and evolve IPC messages to align with mass communications and vice versa. The continuous discussion with community members af ter the vaccination process is vital to reinforce n orms supportive of vaccination. A comprehensive training package for Front Line Workers (FLWs) is available for RO and CO teams to utilize in order to improve vacc inations capacity, especially for IPC. 5A sample of creative materials for initial response and adaptive phase communications is available as part of Polio Communication Global Guide. UNICEF NYHQ. 2016. 6 Extracted from Behaviour Change Communication in E mergencies: Tool Kit. UNICEF ROSA, 2006. 9 B.5.V Monitoring and evaluation Having set the behavioural outcomes, outputs and th eir corresponding indicators, it is imperative to f ind out whether or not the results are achieved. Typical in dicators for monitoring activities include process indicators, such as the number of communication media materials produced and disseminated (posters, flip charts, TV/radio spots, etc.); and/or the number of trainin g workshops conducted (TOT, peer education, etc.). B.5.VI Managing the plan The national plan for a polio outbreak response sho uld include a clear budget and surge capacity plan to support the implementation of interventions at both national and field levels. The plan should be deve loped jointly among all partners and based on the GPEI Fi nancial Resource Requirement (FRR) process. General ly, there are two categories for budgeting communicatio n and social mobilization activities in the FRR. On e is Campaign Social Mobilization and the other is On-go ing communication activities. The former encompasse s activities specifically planned and undertaken arou nd the National Immunization Days (NIDs) and Sub- National Immunization Days (SNIDs) or Supplementary Immunization Activity Days (SIADS). While the latt er are activities implemented during the entire period of the outbreak response and are not dependent on SIA dates. Additionally, the budget may also include the follo wing: /checkbld Costing for various activities like training, advoc acy and social mobilization, production and distribution of various media materials. /checkbld Costing for human resources and the recruitment pla n and duration. B.6 Surge support to communication interventions 7 Recognizing the challenges of meeting surge require ments, the GPEI will follow a two-phase surge proce ss: Rapid Response Phase (Rapid Response Team - \"Team A\"): Within 72 hours o f the outbreak notification, on a no-regrets basis, the GPEI surges pre-identified, trained and experienced professionals with multiple expertise. The team is drawn primarily from existing GPEI staff on a rapid respo nse deployment roster with pre-negotiated approval for deployment of up to one month. Surge Response Phase (Surge Team - \"Team B\"): Within three weeks of the outbreak notification, the GPEI makes available, consistent with the outbreak grade, a mu ltidisciplinary and trained surge team and addition al surge staff as needed and outlined in the outbreak response plan. Key roles for both the Rapid Response Team and the Surge Team include: a polio outbreak technical lead a C4D lead 8 an operations expert (administrative, finance and o perational support) (national level) polio SIAs and surveillance experts (subnational le vel) A training specialist will be also deployed as part of Team A and possibly Team B to initiate the trai ning of front line workers using global tools which would enhance SIA quality. 7 For a detailed surge timeline please refer to Anne x 2 8 A detailed Terms of Reference is available in Anne x 3 10 C. PHASE II- ADAPTIVE PHASE OF COMMUNICATION: ONE TO T HREE MONTHS Within one month, C4D plans should be in motion to support immunization activities. Monitoring of resu lts, and modification of interventions accordingly, is c ritical to effectively reach targeted children. C4D and communication indicators are included as part of th e independent monitoring forms. Independent monitorin g or LQAS data provide an objective assessment of the achieved results, especially coverage; reasons for missed children; and reaching hard-to-reach and mobile populations. Therefore, it will be important after the initial response to: /checkbld Collect observations and data on campaign performance. /checkbld Conduct disaggregated analysis to assess community acceptance and understanding of the polio program. /checkbld Analyze root causes for refusals and access issues and identify key issues underlying barriers to immunization. Barriers can be due to different reasons such as re peated campaigns over short intervals, mistrust in vaccine or frontline workers or several others shown in the ab ove slide. For each there is a recommended set of i nterventions as per the global communication guide. It is of most i mportance that the IPC skills of health providers a re up to standards to be able to respond to the SIA activities in comp lex contexts. At the three- and six-month markers after an event / outbreak is confirmed, the SOPs require an assess ment of how successful applied activities have been in interrup ting virus transmission. At this stage, qualitative assessment may be required to gain a better understanding of the reas ons behind missed children and any resistance to va ccination. Monitoring of planned activities and inclusion of s ocial data as part of independent of monitoring and other forms is a required activity. D. PHASE III- CLOSING THE OUTBREAK AND MAINTAINING SUC CESS: THREE TO SIX MONTHS AND BEYOND By this time, the outbreak intensity should be decr easing and it should be moving towards complete clo sure. However, continuing to focus on SIA quality, strengthening s urveillance, and reaching missed children is critic al. Meanwhile, supporting routine immunization will be the backbon e to maintaining the interruption of virus transmis sion. In this regard, the outbreak response plans should indicate how routine immunization services will be promoted , especially for low coverage areas. This should include the tra ining of frontline workers, production and dissemin ation of IEC materials, and monitoring of services. A plan shoul d be made to integrate polio assets that were speci ally recruited to support polio activities into the health program. T hey can, for example, support routine immunization and other community health services. It is equally important to develop preparedness plans that can mitigate the risk of future outbreaks. The final outbreak assessment reviews co untry improvement plans for routine immunization an d longer- term preparedness plans. The maintenance chapter of the Global Polio C4D Strategy provides additional details for this critical phase. Finally, it's important to document the achievement s and lessons learned from social mobilization, adv ocacy and media and partnership activities at the national, p rovincial and district levels. Use of photos, anecd otes, testimonials, 11 press reports and media coverage is critical to mai ntain national political support and generate donor interest in continuing to support health and immunization progr ammes.

C4D RESOURCES FOR ADDITIONAL INFORMATION & GUIDANCE - http://www.rhizome.work - http://www.polioeradication.org/ 12 ANNEX 1: METHODOLOGY FOR SPECIAL INVESTIGATION TOOL TO IDENTIFY REASONS FOR MISSED CHILDREN A. Description of the tool What is it and why do we need it? Objective of the tool The objective of the special investigation tool is to help the GPEI identify the underlying reasons th at lead to chronically missing children with OPV in high risk areas for po lio transmission. The tool is composed of 3 distinc t sections, which need not be administered sequentially, but doing so would enhance the investigators' depth of understa nding. PARTS A and B are designed to evaluate the planning of SIAs, sta ff capacity, accountability, and leadership at the district (PART A) and sub-district levels (PART B). These parts review microplans and documents relate d to planning and preparatory activities (e.g. funding, meetings, tra inings) conducted prior to the most recent polio SI A and 2) also include rapid interviews with selected field staff. PART C is designed to assess community perceptions and at titudes towards the polio programme and the vaccine , as well as the wider routine immunization system. It f ocuses on the community which triggered the investi gation, and includes 1) rapid interview with one local, traditi onal or religious leader of that community and 2) a cluster survey of 20 households in the community. When is it used? A special investigation can be initiated by nationa l/state/provincial authorities in response to one o r more of the following triggers that identify a potentially seri ous problem of children being missed with OPV: 1. WPV or cVDPV case/cluster Within 3 days of confirmation of the index case as positive for WPV or cVDPV. This investigation shoul d be conducted in conjunction with the \"detailed epidemiological c ase investigation\" of the case. 2. Zero-dose AFP case/cluster Within 7 days of an AFP case investigation identify ing any children as never having received any dose of OPV (excluding the birth dose). 3. Cluster of missed children as identified by indep endent monitoring/LQAS Within 7 days of the identification by external mon itors of a community with a predetermined percentag e of missed children through post-SIA independent monitoring or LQAS. Depending on the level of risk associated wi th the area and/or the severity of the problem, the special inv estigation may be conducted not only once but also immediately after 1 to 3 of the subsequent rounds of SIAs in or der to track change. Countries may have different t hresholds to classify an area as 'poorly covered' or 'chronicall y missed'; these should be determined immediately w hen contextualizing these guidelines for local use. 4. Cluster of refusals during SIAs as identified th rough supervision or monitoring (IM/other): Within 7 days of the identification of a community with a predetermined percentage or number of missed children due to refusal during the most recent SIA. Depending on the level of risk associated with the area and/or the severity of the problem, the special investigation may be conducted not only once but also immediately after 1 to 3 of the subsequent rounds of SIAs in order to track change. Countries may have different thresholds to classify a 'cluste r of refusal' the definition of a cluster should be determined immedi ately when contextualizing these guidelines for loc al use. 5. Other reasons Any other reason as identified by the country such as \"low campaign awareness levels\" as identified th rough locally established thresholds gathered by independent moni toring. B. Usage of the tool How should it be conducted? Once one of the above 5 triggers is reported, a dec ision is made at the national or state level to con duct a special investigation using the standardized tool that has been adapted to the country/local context. The MOH and its partners, primarily WHO and UNICEF, should be part of each in vestigation. Any one agency may take the lead in co nducting one part of the exercise (e.g. UNICEF conducting Part C ) and in consolidating the results and finalizing t he report in consultation with the investigation team. The absen ce of any one partner should be justified and docum ented (in the cover of the tool). All members of the team taking part in the investigation should be trained on the tool beforehand. 13 PART A: District/LGA assessment 1. It is conducted by a joint MOH/WHO/UNICEF team a ppointed by the State/Province 2. Key informants are; 1) The senior District Official (or equivalent) who is accountable for polio (e.g. the District Coordinat or in Pakistan, or the LGA Chairman/deputy Chairman in Ni geria) 2) The District/LGA Polio focal point (either MOH and Partner agency) 3) The District/LGA Communication Supervisor (or equiv alent, such as supervisor for the communication network) 3. Documents to review include the most recent: 1) District/LGA micro-plans, including logistics and s upply plan 2) District/LGA social mobilization plan 3) Minutes of the most recent Task Force meeting 4) Any pre/post-campaign dashboards, SIA data PART B: Sub-district assessment 1. This assessment is to be conducted by a joint MOH/W HO/UNICEF team appointed by the State/Province 2. 2. Key informants include: 1) The sub-district polio focal point (such as EPI Man ager) 2) The Team Supervisor for the most recent campaign fr om the target community to be surveyed 3) The sub-district Communication Supervisor (or equiv alent, such as Supervisor for the communication net work) 3. Documents to review include, the most recent: 1) Sub-district micro plans, including logistics and s upply plan 2) Sub-district social mobilization plan 3) Minutes of the most recent Task Force meeting 4) Any pre/post-campaign dashboards, SIA data 5) Training plan, attendance records and materials PART C: Community assessment 1. Conducted by: a joint MOH/WHO/UNICEF team appointed by the State/Province in the case of one of the tr iggers mentioned above or a stand-alone social barrier eme rging in a community. 2. Key informants include: 1) Local, traditional or religious leaders for the \"co mmunity risk assessment\" 2) One caregiver (ideally the mother) from each of 20 randomly selected households for the \"Community household survey\" 3. Selection methodology 1) Local leaders: Request a social mobilizer (or local health worker if no social mobilizers are present) to identify the top 3 influential leaders for the community. Se lect one at random for the interview. 2) Community household survey: 20 households must be selected for the community su rvey, and the selection must include: a) all households with a child meeting the trigger criteria (WPV/cVDPV case, AFP zero dose, missed children, or refusal) AND/OR b) additional randomly selected households with chi ldren under 5 years of age until 20 households are reached In the case of a zero-dose AFP, WPV/cVDPV case, inc lude the index house and randomly select 20 households with children under 5 yrs of a ge in the immediate area around the index case. C. Analysis and reporting For each investigation conducted, one organization (MOH, WHO or UNICEF) will be made responsible for c ompiling and analysing the data, using the locally adapted repor ting templates. A comprehensive report should be co mpleted and available for sharing within a suggested 1 week of the end of the investigation. The report shall be s hared with all partners in country, and to UNICEF/WHO focal points at Regional and HQ. The status of implementation o f the actions taken against the recommendations laid out in the r eport will be tracked according to each country's c urrent monitoring arrangement as defined in the emergency action plans. Additional monitors should be deploye d during the next SIA, and results compared to the previous roun d data. If there is no improvement, an additional s pecial investigation should be supported. 14 ANNEX 2: RHYTHM OF BUSINESS FOR PRE TEAM A TO TEAM B 15 ANNEX 3: TERMS OF REFERENCE FOR C4D TEAM B TERMS OF REFERENCE: OUTBREAK COMMUNICATION OFFICER (C4D and External Communication) Introduction: The Global Polio Eradication Initiative (GPEI) seek s to ensure that future generations of children wil l be free from the threat of polio virus infection and paralysis. Achi eving this goal depends on interrupting poliovirus transmission in the remaining endemic countries and on ensuring rapid a nd effective responses to poliovirus outbreaks occu rring in polio- free countries. The GPEI has recently revised its S tandard Operating Procedures (SOPs) for the respons e to new polio outbreaks in polio-free countries. i This document describes the Terms of Reference for the Outbreak Communication Officer in the context o f the new SOPs. Purpose of the position: The Outbreak Communication Officer will lead the po lio communication support provided to the country d uring the response to a poliovirus outbreak, working under th e supervision of the Head of the WHO/UNICEF Country Offices and in collaboration with the communication teams of th ose organizations. The communication officer's support to the team at the country office will ensure that the response is : 1. Aligned with the government/Ministry of Health (MOH ) plans and strategies, and 2.
