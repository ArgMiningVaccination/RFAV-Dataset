New Offerings by Established Practitioners and Businesses Rena Basch recently founded Locavorious, a new frozen produce subscription service. Rena's business collects fruit and produce from small farms in the area and freezes them at -15 degrees Fahrenheit in deep freezers at a space near the Ann Arbor airport. Like a community supported agriculture farm (CSA), Locavorious splits up their yield between members who subscribe to receive portions of the food throughout the winter. Rena, who worked in the auto industry for 15 years and spends part of her time working as the Township Clerk for Ann Arbor Township, \"had a CSA farm share myself before starting the company and I loved it. I also love the Farmer's Market. I've always had a particular interest in cooking and food,\" she says. \"I was disappointed at the end of the season when I had to go back to the grocery store to find food,\" and she was pickling a lot of food to last her family through winter. One day, she was talking with her friend, Dawn White, whom she calls the \"Godmother\" of the project. When she was coming up with an idea for a business, her \"head slapping moment happened when Dawn told me to preserve,\" she says. Rena saw a niche market open up ahead of her and decided to start freezing away . Subscribers pick up their fruits and produce on distribution days throughout the winter months. She currently doles out food at the Ann Arbor Farmer's Market, Morgan & York fine wine and specialty food store, and the Corner Brewery in Ypsilanti. As a special treat, Rena sticks copies of her own recipes into her members' shopping bags, and shares tons of recipes on her blog, www.locavorious.wordpress. com. One of the biggest benefits of the way Rena deep freezes her fruits and produce is that the food doesn't thaw and refreeze over and over again, like your fridge at home. \"Our freezers are not self-defrosting. It freezes fast and stay frozen in bags and Tupperware. Fruits and vegetable ruin faster in a traditional fridge - they get mushy and lose taste,\" she explains. Keeping food constantly frozen at a low temperature avoids mushy, tasteless frozen food. \"You can smell how good it still tastes as soon as you open the bag,\" she says. Rena reports that some people seem concerned about what running freezers all day and all night long does to the environment. \"People are concerned about our carbon footprint. But compared to flying in berries from South America all winter, long-freezing of fruit from Michigan saves a lot of fuel and energy,\" she explains. She found a farmer in Ohio who grows edamame soy beans. \"Most of the edema me you buy is shipped all the way from China, but ours is from 90 miles away in Ohio!\" Find out more about Rena Basch and Locavorious, at . Phone Rena at (734) 276-5945 or email rena@locavorious.com New Farmer Fund micro loans are allowing Selma Cafe to fund more hoop house builds than ever before. Jeff McCabe and Lisa Gottlieb, the Old West Side couple who host weekly neighborhood breakfasts at their home every Friday , have already raised money for 10 hoop house builds on small farms in the area. The new Farmer Fund micro loans will build an additional 25 to 30 hoop houses in 201 1, Jeff hopes. One of the biggest benefits that hoop houses offer farmers is that they extend the growing season. You cannot grow everything during Michigan's freezing Winter months, but you can still grow many varieties of leafy greens and other produce in a hoop house as the temperature drops. Their cost varies, but Jeff says the average cost of the ones that Selma money has paid for is about $8,500 a pop. The Farmer Fund officially launched in September 2010, with a fundraiser at Grange Kitchen and Bar. Since then, donors from the community have pledged approximately $40,000 to the fund (as of November 2010), which accounts for 70% of the project' s initial coffer. Donations collected at Selma breakfasts will account for 30%. Jeff has a plan to build 20 hoop houses in the 20 days leading up to July 4th, 201 1. \"Scheduling to build them by the 4th of July was intentional. It's a good time of the year to celebrate, but also it's a good time for the farmers to have the hoop houses and start using them,\" he says. Another ambitious project on the horizon -- \"We are establishing a business incubator for farmers,\" Jeff is excited to report. Speaking with him in late People aren't necessarily sick when they visit Bio Energy Medical Center . \"What we do is really promote wellness, and we're about preventative medicine,\" Patricia Neuenschwander explains. Jeff McCabe has a plan to build 20 hoop houses in the 20 days leading up to July 4th, 2011. \"Scheduling to build them by the 4th of July was intentional. It's a good time of the year to celebrate, but also it's a good time for the farmers to have the hoop houses and start using them.\"The Bio Energy Medical Center Staff In front, from the left: Dr. Uma-Umangini Desai, Dr. Weili Wang and Brandy Boehmer.

(See page 10)Photo by Doug RussellWhat 's New in the CommunityThe Crazy Wisdom Community Journal January - April 2011 Page 10 Continued from page 9 November, Jeff tells me he is still looking for property for the \"farm campus,\" but the project has already received grant funding from the USDA. The incubator \"won't teach people how to farm,\" he explains. Rather, it will be geared toward small farmers who need support learning the ins and outs of \"farmer ownership and creating their own businesses,\" he explains. Keep an eye on the local news for updates in early 2011. Find out more about the Farmer Fund and Selma Cafe online, and keep updated on their blog, at www.RepastsPresentandFuture.org Bio Energy Medical Center husband- and-wife owners Dr. James and Patricia Neuenschwander - along with their staff of diverse wellness practitioners - are enjoying being in their new building, at 3131 Professional Drive. Patricia, who works as the office manager says, \"We were looking to expand our size, but we were also really interested in improving the environment we were in.\" The new office's design is more environmentally-friendly and inviting,\" according to Patricia. The move has also allowed them to update some of their equipment and leave room to expand their services in the future. People aren't necessarily sick when they visit Bio Energy Medical Center. \"What we do is really promote wellness, and we're about preventative medicine,\" Patricia explains. They designed the new space to have \"a spa-like feel,\" with soft lighting and relaxing music and nature sounds. \"The feel is really welcoming and warm, which I think is really important to people who are looking for more of a wellness or preventative type of care. They don't want to walk into tile floors and florescent lighting like you see at the hospital. If they are not ill, they don' t want to go into a place that will make them feel like they are ill. \"Keeping the design green also makes the space more inviting and comfortable for people, according to Patricia. For example, people with allergies and sensitivity to strong smells and chemicals can breathe easy. \"We use all natural flooring, like our linoleum (which is all natural and non-toxic) is set in a water-based glue that doesn't have the high level of toxicity that many types of glue have,\" she explains. The floor in the foyer is polished concrete with a stone-like appearance. \"The concrete was already there, so we took advantage of the opportunity to 'recycle' the floor,\" she says. Bamboo flooring in many of the rooms doesn't only add to the center's spa-like feel, it is also \"breathable and environmentally-friendly,\" she adds. Bio Energy Medical Center offers a wide range of holistic services. Dr. James Neuenschwander M.D. takes a holistic approach to health, offering homeopathic and herbal solutions, and a long list of wellness therapies. He also has been doing a good deal of work treating childhood autism, and the Center also is involved in helping patients with infertility issues. Dr. Weili Wang offers Chinese Acupuncture. Dr. Umangini Desai is an E-map Supervisor and practices Constitutional Homeopathy. Brandy Boehmer offers Colon Therapy, Massage Therapy, and Bio-Cleanse Detoxification. Karen Perkins is a paramedic who helps with IV Therapy. The center also has two Nurse Practitioners, Mary Markle and Laura Goldman, who assist Dr. Neuenschwander with his patients. During the move, the Center updated some of its equipment. \"We haven't really added new services since moving, but we've improved on our services,\" Patricia says. They bought new \"top of the line\" Colon Therapy equipment, upgraded other types of equipment, and installed new reclining chairs and pillows in the IV Therapy room. In the future, Patricia would like to see the center add a new practitioner - perhaps another Nurse Practitioner who \"specializes in pediatrics and takes a more 'integrated approach' to patient care,\" she says. Bio Energy Medical Center is now located at 3131 Professional Drive. Find out more about the Center at (734) 995-3200 or email DrNeu@BioEnergyMedicalCenter.com Yoga and meditation teacher, colonic hydrotherapist, and detox specialist Nancy Gurney is teaching new Restorative / Yin Yoga classes and adding \"ear coning\" treatments to her wellness business, Creative Life Flow . Restorative Yoga and Yin Yoga can be paired together, as in Nancy's new class. However despite some similarities, they also offer different benefits. Restorative Yoga, \"is generally used when people are recovering, or they have an injury or chronic ailment,\" she says. On the other hand, Yin Yoga \"mostly stretches the deeper connective tissues in the lower part of the body, from the belly down. Restorative Yoga uses more props, while Yin Yoga requires long poses that you hold for a while, which requires some endurance,\" Nancy says. Despite their differences, Restorative and Yin Yoga are a good pair, because \"they both stimulate and nourish the energy body,\" and \"complement each other well,\" she thinks. Nancy teaches Restorative/Yin Yoga classes at A2 Yoga (2030 Commerce Blvd.) on Fridays from 7:15 p.m. to 8:15 p.m. Nancy also recently added \"ear coning\" or \"ear candling\" to her list of services. \"It is intended to remove earwax (cerumen) and toxins from a person' s ear by means of a hollow candle placed in the ear,\" according to her website write-up. She is looking forward to seeing how her clients will benefit from the treatment, but \"from what I've heard so far, mostly people report being able to hear better,\" she says.

Phone her at (734) 674-0922 or email n_gurney@yahoo.com New Books by Area Authors Ecofrugal Baby: How to Save 70% Off Baby's First Year, a new book by local author and editor, Laura K. Cowan, is packed full of practical advice for how to stay environmentally-friendly and save tons of cash on baby supplies at the same time. The recent first time mom quickly \"got a reputation for knowing how to save money on baby supplies and seeming like I never paid for anything,\" among her friends, she says. Having a kid is expensive - around $10,000 a year by Laura's estimate. Aside from being a brand new mom, she was also newly laid off from her job as a book and magazine copyeditor a month before she got pregnant. \"My job became saving money. I made couponing a game. I didn't just want to find 20% off, I wanted to combine it with something to make it 40% off and maybe something else that would make it 60% off,\" Laura says. All the money she saves goes towards her daughter's education fund. \"You can smell how good it still tastes as soon as you open the bag.\" (See page 9) Rena Basch of Locavorious Yoga and meditation teacher, colonic hydrotherapist, and detox specialist Nancy Gurney Having a kid is expensive - around $10,000 a year, according to Laura K. Cowan, local author of Ecofrugal Baby . Aside from being a brand new mom, \"My job became saving money. I made couponing a game. I didn't just want to find 20% off, I wanted to combine it with something to make it 40% off and maybe something else that would make it 60% off.\" All the money she saves goes towards her daughter's education fund.Then, Laura got the idea that she should put all of her \"green money-saving tips\" into a book. \"I wanted to help other new parents avoid that mystified dazed feeling of what do I need and how do I get it and then how do I save money. I know that most people aren't as obsessed about research as I am - as a writer and editor, that's what I do. I wrote the book so that other people don't have to repeat the research I've done,\" she says. To prepare to write her book, she needed a way to compile her thoughts and start getting her advice out there. In April 2010, she launched www.29diapers.com , a blog that gives advice about \"ecofrugal\" budgeting methods like using cloth diapers instead of disposable ones. \"Even before I started the website and book, I found myself sending the same email over and over again to my friends who were pregnant or new moms. I also got a reputation for always trying to convince my friends to use cloth diapers,\" she says. Laura discusses cloth diapers in the book. \"It's one of the rare green products out there that is actually cheaper than the alternative. They are way better for the environment and you can argue that they are healthier. There's really no downside,\" she says. You can save about $1,000 dollars a year and keep one ton of trash out of the landfill,\" she reports. Ecofrugal Baby covers a range of topics from car seats, to food, to entertainment, and beyond. It gets very specific about how to save money and stay green, by packing in tons of links to useful websites and stores. She includes a \"Baby's First Year Savings Calculator\" at the end of the book that can serve as a shopping checklist. The book also discusses ways to save money by trading hand-me-downs through \"Free Cycle\" email groups, combine sales by finding promo codes and coupons online, and taking advantage of blog give-a-ways. Her advice; \"Don' t settle for a typical sale. Throw everything you've got at it!\" she laughs. Laura regularly does blog give-a-ways on her www.29diapers.com website. Laura will host a \"mom and baby tea\" at Crazy Wisdom, on April 19th beginning at 3:30 p.m., entitled \"5 Ways to Save $7,000 Off Baby's First Year.\" She will give attendees advice about \"ecofrugal\" spending habits and sign copies of her new book. Buy copies of the book online or download a PDF version, at www.lulu.com/ spotlight/laurakcowanatgmaildotcom Upcoming Events Crazy Wisdom's own Chris Bednash is organizing his fourth installment of \"Dream Seeding,\" an all-ages art exhibition at the Michigan Union , which will be on display March 1 - 31, 2011. This year's exhibition, \"Dream Seeding: For Changing Realities,\" asks any artist who wants to participate in the show to \"envision a better world, whatever that means to you,\" Chris says. If you are an artist working in any medium at any skill level, you can sign up to be in the show until February 14th (Chris will consider late submissions, if there is room left over). Chris considers himself \"a big peace and justice activist,\" he says. However, he is seemingly much more positive than many activists. \"We can't only point out what is wrong in the world. We have to actively think and talk about what we want to see for the world. That's not meant to disrespect activists who point out the bad stuff, but one of the more difficult things someone can do is point out how they want to see it solved,\" he says. The U of M Art and Design school grad, puppet-maker, and long-time Assistant Manager at Crazy Wisdom Book Store, got hooked up with the Michigan Union space through his long-time connection to Deb's House, an Ann Arbor co-op where he lived since graduating from art school in 1999 (he doesn't currently live there, but he maintains strong ties to the co-op). The co-op is a member of the Inter Co-operative Council, which has a good deal with the U of M to use spaces on campus for arts programming. In 2003, Chris threw his first \"Dream Seeding\" show on North Campus, and he really enjoys using the Michigan Union now. Adults, college students, and K-12 kids will show work in the exhibition. The point is not to limit the exhibition to professional or advanced artists, although some will participate. Rather, Chris hopes participants will focus on sharing their dreams and visions of a better world from their own personal perspectives, regardless of their level of skill or life experience. The meaning behind the title, \"Dream Seeding\" is the \"idea of creating a new world. We have to seed our dreams and thoughts we share in the collective un-conscious. It starts as a dream and, if we are lucky, it manifests in reality,\" he says. Chris thinks art is a great way to \"share our solutions with each other,\" because \"it's a relatively safe way to express our thoughts and opinions in a tangible, visual form.\" Chris reaches out to a lot of schools and encourages teachers in Washtenaw County, metro Detroit and the surrounding area to plan class projects for \"Dream Seeding.\" He is looking forward to seeing what middle school students at the Ann Arbor Learning Community are making for the upcoming 2011 show. Not wanting to be left out of the fun, Chris is working on a six foot tall turtle to show in the exhibition. Over the summer, around 300 kids helped work on it at the Ann Arbor Art Fair, and Chris has collaborated with even more artists on the turtle at \"Art Nights\" at Deb's House Co-op. Find out more about \"Dream Seeding: For Changing Realities\" and view submission guidelines, at http://dreamseeding.org/art The first annual \"Michigan Good Food Film Festival\" will screen short films by Michigan residents, college students and K-12 kids, on February 28th beginning at 6:15 p.m. in Washtenaw Community College's (WCC) Morris Lawrence Building. Lead organizer, Victoria Bennett, is an Academic Administrative Associate to the Dean of Business and Computer Technologies at WCC. Victoria plans special projects and events, and she has \"a strong personal interest in food,\" she says. The Crazy Wisdom Community Journal January - April 2011 Page 11 Continued on page 12 This year's exhibition, \"Dream Seeding: For Changing Realities,\" asks any artist who wants to participate in the show to \"envision a better world, whatever that means to you,\" Chris Bednash says. What 's New in the Community Continued from page 11The Crazy Wisdom Community Journal January - April 2011 Page 12 The event is supported by the Food System Economic Partnership, WCC's Digital Video department, Slow Food Huron Valley, and Whole Foods. Victoria says the idea to host a film event about food came together when WCC was looking for ways to get the word out about their strong digital video program, which recently acquired one of the only green screens available to college students in Michigan. She says she also had a conversation with Slow Food Huron Valley's Director Kim Bayer about \"how it would be great to do a film festival highlighting food, and how we needed to have one in town.\" The program will run for about 2 hours and feature a boatload of 30 second and 3-5 minutes shorts produced by adult Michigan residents, college students, and K-12 kids. Victoria expects to see a wide range of subjects, styles, and skill levels among the films people are submitting to the new festival. But in general, the film festival poses a basic question, what does good food mean to you? \"I expect to see everything from a memory of your grandmother's cooking to a political statement about food systems. It could really be anything,\" Victoria says. Posing a broad question and \"leaving it wide open\" for interpretation was very intentional. \"We hope the films people submit will help us survey what members of the community are thinking about [when it comes to good food], which teaches those of us involved in the food movement what good food really means to people out there in the community,\" Victoria says. Plus, the best thing to do with a brand new event is to \"put out ideas for things we'd like to see and then see how people respond. We could end up really surprised with the result - who knows,\" she explains. A panel of judges, comprised of film experts and food experts, will select winning films. Attendees will also be able to vote for their favorite film at the festival and the winner of the \"Viewer's Choice\" award will be announced the following day at HomeGrown's annual \"Local Food Summit\" on March 1st. Find out more about the \"Michigan Good Food Film Festival\", at http://migoodfoodfilmfestival.blogspot.com Save the date: The annual \"HomeGrown Local Food Summit\" is scheduled for March 1, 2011. For the last few years, the summit has been bringing together local food experts, farmers, restaurateurs, community leaders, and anyone who holds a stake in the local food movement. Last year, over 200 people attended The event includes brainstorming sessions, workshops on a wide variety of issues related to food and farming, and tasty local food to eat during the day-long event. Keep an eye out for the latest updates about the HomeGrown Local Food Summit and link to their vast list of participants (which constitutes a heaping list of local foodies who are very active in the local food movement), at http://localfoodsummit.org Don't forget about \"The Ark's Annual Storytelling Festival.\" The event, now in its 24th year, will be held at the Ark on February 19 at 7:30 p.m. and a \"Story Telling for Kids\" will be held on February 20 at 1 p.m. The upcoming Saturday night event will feature \"talespinners from far and wide,\" as always, according to the website. Author, theologian, and banjo player Ed Stivender from Philadelphia will perform at the event this year, along with others TBA. On Sunday, storytellers featured in the show the previous night will do a \"family edition\" with \"tales tailored to young listeners.\" The Ark is located at 316 South Main Street. Find out more about The Ark and the annual \"Storytelling Festival,\" at http://www.theark.org New Classes Writer and writing coach Jeannie Ballew is offering a new non-fiction writing workshop, \"Author's Boot Camp.\" Five week sessions meet on Thursday nights from 6:30 p.m. to 9:00 p.m., from January 13 to February 10 and March 17 to April 14. Jeannie is a professional writer with over 20 years of teaching and training experience, and she facilitates the \"Ann Arbor Writer's Workshop\" writers' group. Aside from running workshops, she coaches writers one-on-one and in small groups through her business Edit Prose. She prefers to keep her workshops small, six people, to make sure there is enough time for ample individual attention. Jeannie takes her non-fiction writing workshop students through various steps involved in the writing process to get them to \"the point where they feel confident to finish an outline of their entire manuscript and feel ownership of the big picture,\" she says. They are exploring \"how to flush out your market audience and identify your purpose, goals, style, tone, and all of that before even beginning the actual manuscript,\" she explains. The workshop begins with a group exercise. Everyone works together on the same story, at first. \"I give them a case study for a book idea and lead them through the steps all together. For example, I have them pretend they are an investigative journalist and they are writing a book on cell phone safety,\" she explains. After working through the steps together, Jeannie gives her students time to apply what they have learned to their own book outlines and manuscripts. \"Then I rotate around and work with people individually, so there is a lot of one-on-one attention,\" she says. The writer throws out a great analogy: \"It's like I take them on a helicopter ride over the territory, and they get to look down and see it for miles. They can think, wow, is all this mine? I hope they will feel excited to get out of the helicopter and go explore on foot!\" Mental health counselor Melissa Gratzinger uses \"expressive therapies\" to address her clients' challenges. Beyond using talk therapy to work through clients' issues, Melissa likes using a number of creative and expressive methods - like Sandtray Therapy, MARI assessments (a Jungian tool), and art therapy using Mandalas, as well as other types of \"therapeutic creativity,\" like mask-making and journaling. Sandtray Therapy seems like her favorite. The method uses a literal tray of sand, into which you place small objects and create a scene. (See page 13) It seems a little bit reminiscent of how I used to play with dolls and action figures in the sandbox as a kid, but \"play therapies\" like Sandtray Therapy work just as well for adults as they do for children, according to Melissa. She has found the method is quite effective when counseling young people. \"It's easier for kids to express themselves when they don't need to use words.\" However, she stresses, \"That's true for a lot of adults too.\" \"Doing something creative creates a visual image for thoughts, emotions, and family dynamics that are usually intangible or subconscious. You can talk about the issues you are having from the objects' perspectives rather than your own, which means keeping it in the tray at a safe distance. You really don't even need to talk about what you make in the sand tray with me at all. The act of doing it and processing it silently is enough sometimes,\" Melissa explains. Melissa also likes to use Mandala art therapy and MARI assessments - a Jungian tool using a deck of symbolic cards and a board. These various methods of mental health counseling require a person \"to intuitively choose symbols or colors. When you are making a Mandala, you choose certain colors that you are drawn to, just like you choose objects to put in a sand tray.\" To do a MARI assessment, she asks clients to choose symbolic cards based on some of Jung's archetypes. \"Colors, objects, and symbols frequently carry universal meanings that most people associate with particular thoughts or feelings,\" she says. Although every individual attaches their own personal meaning to things, Melissa says at least half the time people attach similar meanings to certain objects, symbols, or colors. But ultimately , \"their own personal meaning is the most important meaning,\" she explains. Sarah Love, a buddy of Melissa's since college, is helping develop Creative Mind Counseling \"behind the scenes\" right now - until she finishes her MA in community The Crazy Wisdom Community Journal January - April 2011 Page 13 Many of the writers Jeannie works with are looking to get published. \"I try to help people think about the business end of things and keep their goal of getting published in mind when they are writing,\" she says. However, writers working on personal memoirs that only their families might ever read have attended the workshop. Although she mostly works with non-fiction writers, she also welcomes interested fiction writers to inquire about her coaching services and workshops.

Tai-Ki website! http://sedgeofcranes.org Nigel Kerr, Sensei: 734-845-7917Milford-based media and marketing specialist and healing practitioner Roberta Peterman recently opened a new holistic business, Light Plus Wisdom Consulting. Roberta launched her business last fall, by beginning to offer workshops on \"Mind Nutrition\" that explore how the media - news, T.V . shows, movies, books, etc. - have \"vibrational consequences\" on people's stress levels, emotional state, and general well-being, she explains. She also does esoteric healing, Reiki, and Quantum Touch. She has two workshops on \"Mind Nutrition\" scheduled for January 201 1 with plans to do more down the road. She is also looking forward to working with people one-on-one or in groups to help them plan \"a nourishing media diet,\" she says. Roberta's \"Mind Nutrition\" workshops will be held at the Center for Integrated Well- Being, in Plymouth. Level I, entitled \"Think about what you are thinking about (or what are you feeding your Mind?),\" will happen January 15 from 1 p.m. to 3:30 p.m. and Level 2, entitled \"Think about what you are thinking about next steps (or tools to feed your mind a healthy diet!), is scheduled for January 29 from 1 p.m. to 3:30 p.m. Just as a food pyramid suggests eating ample servings of foods like bread, fruits, and vegetables, while snacking on sugary treats sparingly, \"Mind Nutrition\" encourages people to consider what types of media exposure are \"the most nourishing\" to their emotions, psyche, and spirit and what types are \"best consumed sparingly ,\" according to Roberta. She even has her workshop participants fill out a \"Mind Nutrition\" pyramid and encourages them to consider how \"the diet that they feed their minds impacts the way they feel and a lot of other aspects of daily life.\" \"Everyone reacts differently to certain types of imagery - like violent imagery in a horror movie, for example. Some people can watch violence and they are fine, but if you watch a really violent movie, then it will have some effect on how you feel. Many people get really disturbed,\" Roberta says. You can think about it \"like chocolate cake,\" she smiles. \"It's fine to consume sometimes, but if you have a steady diet of eating chocolate cake, you're going to have a problem,\" she explains. Her workshops also give participants \"historical background - the history of television and communications leading up to what the media is like today,\" Roberta explains. She uses a T.V . to screen clips, creates PowerPoint presentations, and pulls video from Youtube and other sources to show during her workshops.

Lynda offers one-on-one personal training and group classes including kickboxing and yogalates, as well as a number of other classes that cover \"cardio, strength training, and stretching - I like to combine these things,\" she says. Lynda was certified by the American Council of Exercise, in 2008. Before opening BalancePoint Fitness, last Fall, she rented space from the Meri Lou Murray Recreation Center and did in-home personal training. She also teaches Tang Soo Do Karate and self-defense at the Professional Karate Schools of America (PKSA) school in Ann Arbor, with which BalancePoint Fitness shares space. She taught kickboxing at PKSA until opening her business. \"BalancePoint point is definitely separate from PKSA even through some of the space is shared,\" she explains. Fellow PKSA martial arts and kickboxing instructor Jibril Naeem also teaches classes at BalancePoint Fitness and he has also done \"Boot Camps\" at the studio. Lynda says her kickboxing classes \"are good exercise, but it's not just about exercise. I incorporate martial arts moves, I cover a little self-defense in class, and there is strength training thrown in, too,\" she says. \"I think most people probably come for the workout and end up finding the martial arts and self-defense stuf f really valuable,\" Lynda explains. Some of the other classes offered at BalancePoint Fitness include \"Boot Camps,\" which are \"intense and very loosely based on a military boot camps. We jump over things and climb under things and do pushups. But I'm not a drill ser geant. I don't bark at people but try to push them,\" Lynda says. Also, \"Group Circuit Training\" and \"Fitness Mix\" classes incorporate many different kinds of exercise. Lynda likes to \"change things up a lot,\" she says. For example, \"Group Circuit Training\" rotates people through different stations, which change from session to session. \"Changing up your workout without resting in between keeps your heart rate up the whole time. It's about 'muscle confusion'. When you change things up, you avoid plateaus because your body is always being challenged in new ways to keep getting stronger and stronger,\" she explains.

He is currently teaches classes at the Phoenix Center (220 South Main Street) on the art of Tai-Ki. Tai-Ki is Japanese martial art created by the founder of Juko-Kai International (JKI), Rod Sacharnoski. Nigel started his martial arts studies at JKI's White Crane dojo in Ann Arbor, before it moved to Dallas where JKI is headquartered. Now he travels to Dallas to continue his own study of Tai-Ki and other martial arts styles. A computer programmer by trade, \"back in 2008, I was in need of exercise,\" Nigel says. He has tried yoga and pilates, but \"I had trouble sticking with anything,\" he adds. After discovering the art of Tai-Ki, he was hooked. \"Then I got to a point when I knew that in order to get better at it myself, I would need to help others apply it - you learn a lot from teaching someone else.\" What Nigel particularly likes about Tai-Ki: \"I find it very meditative. The moves are very precise but flowing at the same time. There are a lot of health benefits and it's good for stress. Its good exercise, but not like aerobics - it's slower and you hold things for a long time. It can be very relaxing.\" Although, \"all forms of martial arts [have] some sort of self-defense aspect at their root,\" doing martial arts \"isn' t always about learning how to fight,\" he says. In Japanese, Tai-Ki means \"Body Energy,\" and the style \"focuses a lot on breathing along with the movements you are doing\" and \"bringing balance to the body and the body's energy,\" he explains. Nigel plans to teach other types of martial arts in the future. \"The art that I'm studying intensively right now is Shorin-ryu Karate Jutsu,\" another style developed by JKI. \"I have a ways to go,\" but after he achieves his black belt, he will be ready to start offering the style to his students.

In addition to being our Sustainable Health columnist, Judy Stone is also a board member of the Michigan Nutrition Association.) By Judy Stone I wonder if it's universal among baby boomer 50- and 60-somethings in a place like Ann Arbor? We hold fast to the idea that all our efforts toward staying healthy will buy us more time, will insure that we stay ahead of the wave. We pay attention to what we eat, we exercise, we meditate or practice yoga, we detox, and we take whatever supplements we think will keep the noodle functioning and our heart pumping. Yet sooner or later, the wave hits. There is an \"event,\" a symptom, a test result. If we're lucky, we only get drenched \u2014 rather than being tossed around by the wave or, worse, dragged under, where we have to fight to get to the surface to find air and catch our breath. But the illusion that our body can keep going and going and going is shattered; our attention is called inward. In my parents' generation, there was an expectation that something would go wrong with health; it was just considered part of aging. There were fewer treatment options, less understanding of disease, and certainly less of an expectation of the longevity we see possible now. With few exceptions, there was no question that one would follow a doctor's recommendation for drugs, surgery, chemotherapy, radiation, or whatever was considered the standard of care for the condition. But among many boomers and beyond, there is a vastly different ethos that guides how we meet health challenges. Broadly stated, it's the idea that when something goes wrong, we are not simply passive victims of our genes or of cells gone rogue. Illness provides an opportunity to examine life choices, as well as choices in how we respond to a diagnosis. It's not the route for everyone. In Love, Medicine, and Miracles, Bernie Siegel, MD, says that, given a choice between lifestyle change and surgery, eight of ten will opt for surgery. But for the other two, what makes traveling that least-taken-path more possible? Recently I was advised that, due to high eye pressure, I needed laser eye surgery as soon as possible, to avoid the possibility of glaucoma and vision loss. You can be sure that my first question was not, \"Can't I just eat more carrots?\" I'd like to say that I had the presence to think about why eyes that had been stable for decades now suddenly needed holes poked in them with lasers, but I didn't; I made the appointment for 48 hours later.The day between the eye exam and my appointment with \"Dr. Power Ranger,\" I saw an energy healer. And it was she who helped me to reconnect with my inner knowing. We did energy work on my eyes and the energy meridians connected to them. But, probably more importantly, we talked about life choices I had made recently that conflicted with my life vision, and in an instant I saw one aspect of the problem \u2014 I was physically manifesting the pressure to limit my vision. When I went for my surgery the next day with \"Dr. Power Ranger,\" my eye pressure was normal. I felt that, given this news, I'd bought some time to reflect and investigate choices, and I declined the surgery. I started to explain this to the surgeon; I guess I wanted him to know I wasn't being careless. But he couldn't have been less interested. \"It's your decision,\" he interrupted, \"but I strongly urge you to have the surgery\" \u2014 a phrase he repeated two more times before I left. Fear of losing my eyesight had caused me to lose sight in a different way. I \"forgot\" what I know and believe about the nature of illness and the nature of healing. It was only 24 hours between making the decision to have the surgery and stepping back from it, but, in that time, I came close to having a procedure with significant risks -- without a process of inquiry that was true to my self. I started thinking concretely about what people need in the face of alarming medical news, in order to make thoughtful, well-examined decisions that may or may not lead us away from the medical standard of care. We're often alone in a doctor's office, being presented one point of view very persuasively, as if it's the only point of view. They are so certain, and we \u2014 while being flooded with information that is new to us, usually out of our realm of knowing, and delivered when we are most vulnerable \u2014 are expected to make life-altering decisions. How do we create space for ourselves to make good decisions? What is the role of fear? What can we, or should we, expect or ask for in our doctors? I began speaking about this with other people \u2014 two of whom had faced, in my mind, probably one of the hardest diagnoses with which to go against the tide: the big C. To honor their privacy, I will call them Carol and Doug (instead of their real names). Carol, a senior citizen, was diagnosed with invasive, stage two breast cancer that had not metastasized beyond the lymph nodes. Doug, age 56, was diagnosed with prostate cancer. Carol's doctor wanted her to have a mastectomy, but she knew right away that she only wanted to pursue alternative care. Her doctor, while saying he didn't recommend her choice, said that he would support her and would order any supportive diagnostic tests. As physicians are the gatekeepers of most lab work, this was a huge gesture of collaboration from Carol's doctor, which helped empower her in putting together her own plan of care. In contrast, Doug had a very different experience. Initially he was \"offered\" either surgical removal of the prostate or radiation, and the likely side effects of impotence and incontinence. He immediately began researching, took some time to evaluate, and pursued any alternative modalities with which he \"felt a resonance.\" He also decided to schedule the radiation for a few months away. Just before the radiation, while meditating, Doug felt strongly that something had shifted, and requested repeat blood work for Prostate Specific Antigen, a marker for prostate cancer. The number had dropped dramatically. His urologist told Doug he no longer needed radiation. When Doug cancelled it, the radiation oncologist delivered the threat, \"You'll be sorry; you'll be back within a year.\" (That hasn't happened; it's been over three years.)As Carol expressed, when we choose to see MDs as experts in their field, rather than Medical Deities, we retain our power. Recognizing the difference between the doctor who sees him- or herself in service to you as a consultant, rather than as a parent to an uncooperative child, can help to ensure you have a good match. When we're scared, it's easy to let the doctors do the driving, but it's always our choice. And if it's a collaboration you're after, find the doctor who will honor that. \"Are you willing to take the time to look at alternatives?\" \"Are you worth it?\" and \"Do you have the strength to do it?\" are three questions that Carol suggests we ask ourselves. \"Don't make a snap decision; take time to look at who you are and what you think is going on.\" When we are confronted with a diagnosis that has potentially serious, life-altering or life-threatening outcomes, fear can play a big part in how we make decisions. Our faith is tested, not the least of which is our faith in whatever non-traditional healing modalities we so nonchalantly rely on when turning down flu vaccines or eschewing the latest blockbuster medication. It's easy to be unconventional, self-reliant, and even somewhat cocky about standing outside traditional medicine when the stakes are low. But when life raises the ante, where do courage and clarity come from? Though expressed differently, both Carol and Doug noted similar elements that made their journeys outside the mainstream possible. For both, their deep spiritual connections guided them (they are both spiritual teachers). Doug spoke about fear as a visitor. \"I meet fear when it comes, but I don't submit to it.\" Sometimes the fear we meet comes through the people close to us. Carol's husband and daughter support her, but are not always happy with her path. Doug's family wants him to \"just get it taken care of.\" And both spoke strongly about calling on themselves to step up, which, for each of them, meant not just searching outside themselves for alternative treatments, but opening fearlessly to what was inside, even reconciling with the possibility of dying. Carol told me of an incident that happened to her the day she left her oncologist's office, having decided to chart her own course. \"It was a drizzly day. When I came out from my appointment, my left car window was smashed and my GPS had been stolen. After my initial reaction, I realized the lesson: 'You do not have to rely on an automated [guidance] system; you can rely on your own intuition.' \" At her 6-month check-up, Carol's oncologist told her, \"Keep doing what you're doing; you could probably live another 30 years this way.\" ### (Judy Stone can be reached at 734-994-5549 or at: cfninA2@gmail.com.

She grew up on a family farm, and received a BS in Sustainable Business from Aquinas College in Grand Rapids. Before coming to the Ecology Center, she worked at a hospital in Grand Rapids, where she started a farmers market, created sustainability education materials and monitored storm water runoff from green roof and rain gardens. Hillary also served on the Executive Board of the Greater Grand Rapids Food System Council. She's been at the Ecology Center since April 2009.) Bill Zirinsky: Hillary, you are the Ecology Center's Healthy Food in Health Care Coordinator. Right now you're very involved with trying to bring healthy food into hospital systems and support sustainable food systems. Give us a brief overview of this program. Hillary Bisnett: Our program works with hospitals across the state that are interested in purchasing locally and sustainably-produced foods for their patients and staff. Health care facilities are recognizing that our entire food system - the way our food is produced and distributed - is misaligned with dietary guidelines, and is largely reliant on methods of production and distribution that harm public and environmental health. Hospitals around the country have been signing a \"healthy food pledge\". What is it? Is hospital participation growing in Michigan? The pledge commits hospitals to implement policies and programs that demonstrate a commitment to a food procurement system that is based on the Hippocratic Oath of \"first, do no harm.\" The philosophy of the pledge is to consider food and its production and distribution as preventative medicine that can protect the health of patients, staff and communities. The pledge has helped hospitals demonstrate leadership by sending a strong signal to the marketplace encouraging local, nutritious, sustainable food production, and by modeling healthy food practices for patients and the community. To date, over 300 hospitals across the nation have signed the pledge including 28 facilities in Michigan. Just two years ago, only three hospitals were participating in our state. BZ: Hospitals have been hosting farmers markets. How many in Michigan? Tell us more. Bisnett: More than ten Michigan hospitals hosted a market last year and many have expressed interest in hosting one next year. Bronson Methodist Hospital in Kalamazoo and Henry Ford West Bloomfield Hospital even host indoor winter markets. This has been a great way for hospitals to provide a service to patients, employees and visitors, while supporting local food producers. As many communities have limited access to fresh produce, it's logical for hospitals to want to provide a foundation for good health: good food. Hospitals are in a unique position to both treat diet-related illnesses and address their root causes by hosting a farmer 's market. Markets also strengthen staff morale, while increasing the likelihood that patients, visitors, and staff will eat nutritious fresh foods. They are also a fun venue for educating about nutrition, food preparation and the benefits of eating fresh and local, all of which further contribute to the long-term development of healthy eating habits. Additionally, this provides another avenue for family farmers to sell directly to the public, often resulting in farmers receiving a fair wage and food dollars staying in the local economy. BZ: What's been happening in southeast Michigan?Bisnett: We have a leader in Washtenaw County -- Joseph Mercy Hospital! In April 2010, St. Joseph installed a hoop house and prepared a few acres of land for growing vegetables. In early September, a second hoop house was built. This is 'phase one' of a long-term plan, according to 'Farmer Dan' Bair, the farm manager for St. Joseph. The current focus is providing produce to the hospital's farmer's market, with a goal to farm up to thirty acres to supply patient and cafeteria meals. St. Joe's CEO Rob Casalou's hope of a paradigm shift, not only for his hospital, but also for the health care sector at large, aligns nicely with their reason for signing the Healthy Food Pledge and onsite food production. He's been quoted saying, \"When people think of St. Joe's, they're thinking of sick care, but we're really a health provider. So we decided to take a significant part of our land and turn it into production for health and wellness.\"At the University of Michigan Hospital, they are sourcing nearly all of their dairy products from a farm in west Michigan while working to purchase compostable take-out containers as well as working to increase local produce purchases. Allegiance Health in Jackson has been in conversations with a new farmer co-op hoping to supply two institutions in their area. Also, the Henry Ford Health System partnered with Detroit's Eastern Market to host a traveling farm stand throughout the health system while piloting an employee CSA (community supported agriculture) program at their administrative building - to increase the amount of fresh produce their employees take home - to encourage healthy eating habits among employees. These are just a few examples in southeast Michigan. BZ: Can you tell us about the Michigan Healthy Food Workgroup? How many hospitals participate? What was their most recent project and how is the Ecology Center involved? Bisnett: The Michigan Healthy Food Work Group is an advisory subcommittee of the Michigan Hospital Association's Michigan Green Healthcare Committee. Currently, there are nineteen hospital members who have committed to collaborating on healthy food initiatives, and to leveraging their purchasing power to support local, sustainable food. Starting in April 2010, the committee recognized the amount of expertise in the state already , and felt meetings should include peer-to-peer learning. Participating hospitals also collaborate on a yearly healthy food initiative. Last year's focus was on the Michigan Apple Campaign, an initiative to create a baseline of Michigan apple purchases and to demonstrably increase these purchases the following year. The Ecology Center's role has been to facilitate the work of the Michigan Healthy Food Work Group. BZ: What's the Ecology Center's vision for this work over the next few years?Bisnett: We will continue to support the purchase of sustainable foods in the health care sector, but we also hope to expand our work to clinician education. We see many benefits in working with health care clinicians as they play a vital role in educating their patients, community and institutions. Clinicians are recognized as trusted experts and have an influential role, not only in the clinic, but in society as well. Our focus will be on talking about the interconnections between our entire food system and our health, and advocating for clinician involvement in interventions that can be considered true prevention. We also hope to work with regional food distributors to increase their offerings of sustainable, local food. ###Bringing Healthy Foods into Michigan's Hospitals ~ Questions for Hillary Bisnett of the Ecology Center A hoop house at St. Joe's Hospital. In April 2010, St. Joe's installed a hoop house and prepared a few acres of land for growing vegetables. In early September, a second hoop house was built.

BZ: Please tell us about Sri Sri Ravi Shankar. Dr. Aditi Dave: Sri Sri Ravi Shankar has dedicated his life to serving humanity. He personally travels to 30-40 countries every year inspiring service for the disadvantaged and traumatized who need basic aid and comfort. To those lucky enough to have all their basic needs covered, he brings wisdom. This wisdom is shared through the Art of Living programs. BZ: And is Art of Living completely separate from the Transcendental Meditation community founded by Maharishi Mahesh Yogi? Dr. Aditi Dave: Yes, there is no working relationship between these two organizations; they are independent of one another. BZ: I understand that the Art of Living's introductory course teaches Sudarshan Kriya. Please tell us what Sudarshan Kriya stands for, and what it is. Dr. Aditi Dave: Sudarshan Kriya is a unique practice that quickly calms the mind and flushes stress out of the system. It is also a gateway into deep, silent meditation. It is the cornerstone practice of the Art of Living Course and is only taught by teachers trained by Sri Sri Ravi Shankar. Once learned it is practiced at home for just 10 minutes. It provides great benefits on its own but is ideally included as part of a set of practices along with yoga asanas, pranayama, and silent meditation. BZ: You have said to me that \"the breath is in the present moment - you can't breathe in the past or the future.\" Say more, please. Dr. Aditi Dave: The mind constantly wanders to the past or future without even being aware that it is happening. You cannot control this by using the mind. Try to concentrate and keep your mind in the present and you will see it drift away in less than a minute. But by using a skillful breathing practice the mind will automatically come to the present moment. This is when meditation can happen. Taking the time to perform practices daily reduces this tendency of dwelling on the past and future. Then, life spontaneously becomes better because of the richness of the present moment. BZ: Aditi, tell me what you mean when you say \"the breath is the link between the outer world of activity and the inner world of silence?\" Dr. Aditi Dave: Using breathing practices is the most effective way to restore quietness to the hyperactivity of thinking. For a busy mind to attain the silence of meditation the breath is best used first to bring some calm and increase energy (prana). BZ: Will you talk about our breath as a kite?Dr. Aditi Dave: Without a string a kite can be blown in any direction by the wind. The mind also is blown around to the past and future by the many impressions, stresses, memories and habits inside us. The breath is like a string, using the breath the mind gains some focus, it comes back to its center, to the present where we can experience peace and become aware of the joy inside us. BZ: How does the sudarshan kriya practice refresh an individual?Bill Zirinsky: Dr. Aditi, I know you as a deeply compassionate physician, as someone who was kind to our family when our daughter, Juliana, was facing end-of-life issues, both medical and human. You are a doctor working at the U-M Hospital, and you also work, independently, as a meditation instructor connected to the Art of Living community. Before you talk about the Art of Living programs that you lead, please briefly describe your medical training and credentials. Dr. Aditi Dave: I received my medical degree in Florida, and completed a dual residency in Internal Medicine and Pediatrics at the University of Michigan. I am now 3 years out of residency, serving as a hospitalist and faculty member in the division of Internal Medicine at the University of Michigan. As such, I take care of patients hospitalized, many of whom need tertiary care medicine. Bill Zirinsky: You mentioned to me that the Art of Living program is not just a meditation program... Please tell us what it is. Dr. Aditi Dave: The goal of the Art of Living program is to help people improve the quality of life. To accomplish our goal we use several approaches: providing training in mind-body practices; education of the negative habits and tendencies in the mind that directly affect everyday life; encouraging service programs to help those in need because service directly helps the recipients while also uplifting and transforming those who provide the service; and providing regular group events and retreats to delve deeper into mind-body practices and spiritual knowledge. The mind-body practices we teach include yoga asanas, pranayama breathing, and several methods to achieve deep meditation. Meditation is a key component of the program because the rejuvenation of the mind that occurs in deep mediation is essential to establish peacefulness and expand awareness. True meditation allows the mind to settle into a state of stillness. It is different from the sleep state, it is not contemplation, and it is well beyond simple relaxation. While stillness is a natural state of rest, the extreme stress and over-stimulation common today makes it difficult for people to attain it. This is why proper training and technique is critical. Unfortunately, meditation is widely misunderstood. Many have tried meditation and given up because they were not consistently having a deep experience. Others practice relaxation techniques that are called mediation, and while helpful, they do not offer the same opportunity for rejuvenation. When the mind does not rejuvenate periodically through stillness in meditation the awareness gradually shrinks and the mind becomes hyperactive. What is thought of today as normal thinking is really hyperactive because very little time is spent aware of the present moment. Clarity is reduced and the feeling level of life, the joy and love, is over-shadowed by incessant thinking. Children start off living in the present moment but as they age stress accumulates and habits develop that cause the mind to constantly think about the past or future. The result is that we rarely see the same level of joy, peace, enthusiasm, unconditional love, authenticity, and connection in adults that is natural to young children. Children show us that these qualities are the truest, unadulterated essence of humanness. Not knowing how to maintain these qualities into maturity our society accepts their loss as normal and life becomes more about coping than truly enjoying. Fortunately there are now many speakers and authors bringing Questions for Dr. Aditi Dave about Meditation, Medicine and Consciousness Dr. Aditi Dave is a hospitalist and faculty member in the division of Internal Medicine at the University of Michigan. She also leads Art of Living meditation programs and workshops. \"True Listening means being fully present in that moment, and when this is combined with a clear, stress-free mind, the quality of your work is much more effective.

There are already individual staff at the University of Michigan who are doing this in their own way, and already practicing medicine with increased mindfulness and awareness. The next step would be to make these practices available for everyone interested. BZ: What is the power of telling a patient to \"keep her spirit up\"? Questions for Dr. Aditi Dave about Meditation, Medicine and Consciousness \"We all know the years in life go by fast and if we can just incorporate a half hour per day to sitting comfortably and doing some practices, the difference in our life will be tremendous.\"Dr. Aditi Dave: Tension, stress, and anxiety leave the system, energy is increased, and the mind becomes clear and calm. BZ: Aditi, along with many doctors and nurses and health care professionals who are trying hard to react in a human way in institutional settings, you also certainly encounter a good deal of \"unawareness\". How do you bring your own conscious awareness to medical situations you face at the hospital? What are the small things you do each day, what are the challenges you face? Dr. Aditi Dave: Yes, in a large institution, where patients are often extremely sick, skillful coordination of many services and specialties is required to get the patient better. Patients and their families come to us at a vulnerable time, often very stressed. In taking care of their needs, health care professionals can also encounter stress, which is then amplified if there is stressful interpersonal communication between health care professionals. In a field where effective, timely coordination of many services is vital in getting the patient better, I find being centered and aware, allows me to respond to stressful situations rather than REACT to them. The latter can often set off a chain reaction of stress in others. I find this happens a lot around the hospital: a 'domino-effect' of unnecessary stressful communication. In recognizing this as it happens, one can easily diffuse it instead of taking it into one's own system. For example, recognizing that someone spoke to you unpleasantly because they are stressed (that comes out in their communication), allows you to still be harmonious in your communication. I can 'save' my own mind from outside stress in real time, rather than have to do extra-curricular activities to relieve stress after it has already happened. For example, if a nurse is stressed due to something someone said to him/her, this may be carried over to the way I am spoken to, and so on. By being more aware, one helps diffuse this, rather than react to it or take on stress. It could be as simple as saying to the nurse, \"It sounds like your day has been difficult, let me see what I can do to help.\" Then his/her consciousness shifts from stress, back to the present moment of taking care of the patient. BZ: You said to me that you wished there were greater efforts at the hospital to involve the medical staff in destressing the environment. What kinds of efforts would you like to see? And do you feel hopeful about strides being made in the medical setting, in terms of staff trying to be more conscious?... If so, please give us examples. Dr. Aditi Dave: One of the challenges within the health care services is how to effectively take care of patients. Removing stress from the hospital environment means giving health care professionals an effective tool of distressing. I would like to see an established system within the hospital of taking care of the wellness and mindfulness of all health care professionals - from doctors, to nurses, to other allied health care workers. Bringing breathing practices such as Sudarshan Kriya and meditation into the hospital as opportunities for health care professionals to seize would create a de-stressed environment. Industry and large organizations have already done this. For example, companies such as IBM, and organizations such as the World Bank, have arranged for Sudarshan Kriya to be taught at the workplace because they see the value of having their employees less stressed. It would be nice to bring such powerful techniques to the \"My experience helped me recognize how important it was to stay centered when helping others.

Free 8 week course - Creating Space: Clarity and Insight through Meditation Free with mention of this ad, begins January 10Dr. Aditi Dave: When a patient is sick, they have lost much of the \"control\" they have of the outcome. The one thing they do have control over is keeping their spirit up, and centering the mind on the positive rather than dwelling on the entire negative in the situation. At a time when the patient feels scared, or despondent, encouraging them to keep their spirit up, the one thing they do have control over, and to stay positive. Often they are very appreciative of this supportive reminder. This is reassurance that I am doing everything I can medically, while they do everything they can to remain positive and centered despite a tough situation. BZ: Aditi, recently you said to me: \"True Listening is a skill. Combined with compassion and clarity of mind,\" and also combined with the skills and knowledge of a doctor, \"doctors could be very effective.\" Would you like to elaborate on that? Dr. Aditi Dave: 'True Listening' means being fully present in that moment, and when this is combined with a clear, stress-free mind, the quality of your work is much more effective. One's interpersonal communication skills become refined. True listening really makes the patient and families feel you are working with compassion and that you care. BZ: You grew up in very interesting places. Can you tell us where you grew up, and a bit about how the experience of growing up in those places still influences and affects your perspective, and your life? Dr. Aditi Dave: I was born in Kenya, and my first language was Swahili. I have picture memories of Kenya, of the immense generosity of the people and of course the wildlife. We moved when I was 5 years old to Belize, at a time when it still had not been discovered as a tourist destination. I spent my childhood there until age 12, and enjoyed the unspoiled nature and complete simplicity in life. I recognized just how happy and content people are without much of modern day amenities. I then moved to Canterbury, England, where I had my formative years, and later lived in London for college, before moving to the U.S. All these places hold a special place in my heart, and each make up a part of where I am from. It has made me realize that home is wherever you are. Each place offered a diverse array of experiences that definitely contributed to my desire to do International Health Care volunteer work. I recognized how we are not so different regardless of culture, the universality of Human Values and the need to give service to global needs even if we think of our place in society or on earth as insignificant. BZ: I know that you experienced a significant hospitalization at a young age, and a lengthy rehabilitation. Your rehabilitation was, to me, a remarkable story of determination. How was that experience important to your path --- both in terms of becoming a doctor, and in terms of becoming someone who teaches people about conscious awareness? Dr. Aditi Dave: It ultimately inspired me to become a physician. Doing rehab to be able to walk again also fueled my interest on the importance of mind-body connection in overcoming adversity. Raising one's consciousness and being more mindful allows one to get through adversity more positively. My experience helped me recognize how important it was to stay centered when helping others. The process of surgery and rehab in learning to walk again without pain gave me valuable perspective on what it is like to be a patient. As a doctor, this helps me empathize. My experience also inspired me to become a physician. I remember thinking, \"If I can help even one person the way my surgeon had, or encourage one person through a trying time, then the hard work in becoming a doctor will be more than rewarded.\" As a teacher of Art of Living programs, my experience also allows me to give more of a personal inspiration to those who are in stressful situations in life. BZ: And your spiritual upbringing? You were brought up as a Hindu and as a Roman Catholic? Tell us about that, please, and how did your parents help you to reconcile those religious elements? Dr. Aditi Dave: My mother raised me with Hinduism, and I went to Catholic and Anglican schools. As a child, I wondered why prayer was through multiple, different methods. My mother reconciled these different religions when she said: \"true religion is when you can see the divine in every human being.\" She also said that all these religions were like paths up the same mountain. She focused on the universal spirituality that remains the same through all religious beliefs. This was invaluable. This resonates with the Art of Living Programs which are taught in over a 140 countries, crossing over all religious or cultural belief systems, because it focuses on raising the individual's consciousness, his or her ability to live in the present moment, and servicing one's spirit.\"Children start off living in the present moment but as they age stress accumulates and habits develop that cause the mind to constantly think about the past or future.\" BZ: How did you become involved in the Art of Living programs? Dr. Aditi Dave: My brother took the course through a co-worker and loved it. I was in college at the time, and my brother arranged for the course to happen in our family home during my winter break so that I could take it. It was very sweet of him to give this to me as a gift. At the time, I knew I had done something very special for myself, but the effectiveness of the practices became apparent during medical school when my fellow students began asking me what I do to handle the stress as I seemed \"so calm and happy at a stressed time.\" They asked me to arrange a course for them. It was a huge success, and soon it became a volunteer activity to bring courses to Tampa, FL, during medical school. I found it very gratifying to see how positively this program affects people's wellness. BZ: And you've been leading programs and workshops? What programs are upcoming this fall? And how can people find out more about your programs, and about Art of Living programs? Dr. Aditi Dave: The schedule of programs can always be found at www.artofliving.org by selecting the menu of courses for Ann Arbor, Michigan. All of our programs are run by volunteers and we do not have a physical office space so we do the best we can to offer the programs locally every other month. The next course will be offered in October, and are posted at: secure.artofliving.org (choose MICHIGAN). BZ: Tell us about the Art of Living's youth programs, and also about bringing sudarshan kriya to inner city kids. Dr. Aditi Dave: The Youth Empowerment Seminar (YES) is currently being taught to inner city high school children ages 14-18, with programs in Chicago, Los Angeles, New York to name a few. Neither at school, nor at home, are children taught how to manage their mind or their emotions. Can you imagine how much empowerment can be given for kids to learn a practice they can do at anytime to handle stress at an early age. Often inner city youth have little to no mentorship at home or at school. Our public schools are in crisis, and our teachers are stressed from being given limited resources to help children reach their full potential. Having YES programs in schools transforms youth but also positively influences the teachers and administrators exposed to it. BZ: You've said that \"the emotions affect breath, and the breath affects emotions\". If there were one thing you'd like to get across, to help encourage someone to begin a breath practice, what is it? Dr. Aditi Dave: These practices are not hard to do and the results are seen quickly. We all know the years in life go by fast and if we can just incorporate a half hour per day to sitting comfortably and doing some practices, the difference in our life will be tremendous. ### \"I find this happens a lot around the hospital: a 'domino- effect' of unneces- sary stressful communication.

We asked Dr. Monica Turenne of the Washtenaw Veterinary Hospital to write this first one. She is a Doctor of Veterinary Medicine, and a Certified Veterinary Acupuncturist.) Acupuncture is a treatment modality that has become more mainstream in the past few decades. As part of the care I provide for dogs and cats, I have found veterinary acupuncture to be incredibly rewarding. To help you understand more about this therapy, I have compiled several questions and answers, and shared details about several cases. How long has acupuncture been used in veterinary medicine? For about 3,000 years. The first \"needles\" were actually made of stone and evidence shows their use in humans dating back 8,000 years! Why is veterinary acupuncture gaining popularity? Because of its efficacy and minimal side effects. This is also true for herbal medicine. And I also think that pet owners want their pets to live as they live - organically, free of preservatives and toxins. We see this is in how owners feed their pets, and in veterinary medicine, we are seeing this in how owners want to treat illnesses in their pets. What diseases can veterinary acupuncture treat? Almost any disease, including but not limited to arthritis, muscle soreness, disc problems, skin allergies, epilepsy, anxiety, asthma, kidney failure, cancer support, diarrhea, vomiting and more. How does acupuncture work? There are two ways of looking at acupuncture. One approach emphasizes the body's physiologic response to the needles. With this approach, evidence shows that as needles are inserted into the skin, blood flow increases to that area which speeds healing. Placement of needles also decreases muscle spasms and causes endorphin release which alleviates pain and makes the animal feel good, respectively. The second way of looking at acupuncture is the Chinese/Eastern medicine approach, which views disease as an imbalance in the body. In Chinese medicine, the belief is that energy flows along channels or meridians in the body so if there is imbalance, there is disruption of energy flow which leads to illness and pain. With detailed history taking, and Chinese examination, which involves looking at the tongue color and feeling the pulses, we are able to make a Traditional Chinese Veterinary Medicine (TCVM) diagnosis. Once the imbalance and diagnosis are known, our goal is to re-establish balance, energy and harmony in the body, thereby restoring health and allowing the body to heal. We can accomplish this by knowing what acupuncture points to select and which herbal medicines would be most appropriate. How does Chinese medicine differ from Western medicine?If we had three patients who are the same age, sex and breed and who all had the same medical condition, they would be treated in the same way in Western medicine. In Chinese medicine, each one of these patients may have a different imbalance and may be treated very differently depending on their TCVM diagnosis. For example, one patient may have a deficiency in heat but another may have a deficiency in coolness. Nevertheless, once the underlying imbalance has been corrected, acupuncture and herbal medicine are used to keep the patient balanced. In doing so, Chinese medicine focuses more on prevention. Can you combine veterinary acupuncture and Western medicine? Absolutely. Some patients are on medications such as steroids or non-steroidal anti-inflammatories. Some owners are interested in weaning their pets off medications and others want additional pain control. I work with owners to achieve their goals for their pet. In many cases, acupuncture and Chinese herbal medicine can replace Western medicines. And in some cases, patients may have liver or kidney disorders that prevent them from being able to use Western medications. One patient of ours is an 8 year old Brittany Spaniel. She had an injury and arthritis and was potentially going to need medications in order to continue her hunting career. We started acupuncture and she responded very well. Even her owner (an initial skeptic) is now a believer! We were able to avoid non-steroidal anti-inflammatories. She is on herbal medications and is hunting with the best of them! I also treat a Labrador Retriever for neck pain. His pain is alleviated with not just acupuncture alone but with a combination of acupuncture and muscle relaxants. This is what works for him and the owners are very pleased with the results. Acupuncture for Dogs and CatsAll creatures great and small By Dr. Monica Turenne \"I had a mix breed dog coming to see me for an injury to the knee. The owner would bring a giant bulk size jar of peanut butter. During the whole acupuncture session, the dog would have his entire nose inside the peanut butter jar eating the peanut butter!\" You're welcome here!Harmony Yoga of Ann Arbor Certified Iyengar Yoga teacher, Karen Husby-Coupland. 1955 Pauline Blvd. Suite 100 B Ann Arbor MI 48103 734-222-9088 www.HarmonyYogaAnnArbor.com The Crazy Wisdom Community Journal January - April 2011 Page 21 How many appointments are necessary to see results? This depends on the case, but usually weekly sessions for 4-6 weeks are necessary to see results. If there is no improvement by 6 weeks, the patient may be a non-responder. While this can happen, most patients show some type of response. We then increase the time between appointments, with the goal of eventually having one appointment every 4-6 months. How do the dogs and cats handle needles? Dogs typically tolerate the acupuncture needles well, and often relax and even fall asleep during the appointment. With cats, the response varies, depending on their personality. One case I had was a male Beagle who had to be muzzled for acupuncture. The owner knew he would not tolerate the needles and that he would attempt to bite if not muzzled and she was right. But muzzled, we were able to complete his sessions. As we treated him, he slowly improved. He started to become more mellow at home and less aggressive, and eventually, after a few months of acupuncture and herbal therapy, we were actually able to do the sessions without a muzzle and could even pet him. Another case I had was a cat who was having problems with constipation. She was not normally a very nice cat but she presented very ill so she was allowing us to do anything. The owners were interested in alternative therapies so after we performed the necessary treatments to relieve her constipation we started acupuncture and herbal therapy. She tolerated the needles very well and began to improve at home. Her appetite got better and she was using the litter box more normally. After 2 treatments, she made it very clear that she was no longer interested in acupuncture! So we no longer attempted acupuncture, but continued herbal therapy, which kept her regular and the owners were happy. And I have to share the funniest case I have had. I had a mix breed dog coming to see me for an injury to the knee. The owner would bring a giant bulk size jar of peanut butter. During the whole acupuncture session, the dog would have his entire nose inside the peanut butter jar eating the peanut butter! There are some patients who will not tolerate needles. It is ironic that my own dog is an example of one of them! He was simply too sensitive and there are dogs and many cats that are like this. In these cases we can use herbal therapy and food therapy to treat the patient. What are some cases you have treated with veterinary acupuncture? I treated a Chihuahua who became paralyzed on all 4 limbs due to a disc problem. The owner was tapering medications because of lack of response and side effects. We did every other day acupuncture and slowly, he regained the use of his legs and returned to normal function! I have been treating a Brittany Spaniel who had a benign but invasive mass removed from his face at a specialty clinic...twice. After the second surgery, the owners started alternative treatment to prevent recurrence. After the first surgery, it came back after one year. We have been doing food therapy, Chinese herbs and regular acupuncture. It has now been more than a year and no sign of recurrence. He is doing great!! A six year old Pug was prone to allergies in the summer months. Unfortunately, we were unable to extend his time between acupuncture visits by more than one week, so for the summer, he came to see me weekly. But we were able to avoid steroids. I am currently treating a young Golden Retriever who has multiple orthopedic issues that cannot be dealt with surgically. The owner has chosen not to put him on medication but instead comes in once monthly for acupuncture. She sees acupuncture as his \"medicine\". He has done very well and is very comfortable! ### (Dr. Monica Turenne can be reached at the Washtenaw Veterinary Hospital, 2729 Packard Road, Ann Arbor, MI 48108; their phone number is 734-971-5800 and their website is: www.washtenawveterinaryhospital.com)\"Some owners are interested in weaning their pets off medications and others want additional pain control.

I'll leave the curtains closed against the day until... ...until some new reality extends itself from outside into the house, acting like a bug-eyed giant reaching in to grab the innocent occupant. How would he (naturally) get the captured damsel back out? Would he squeeze her small just for the fun of it? \"Cut with the thinking, would you!\" She (Solitude, naturally) says. \"I saw you as gray this morning,\" I admit, \"and I didn't think much about that. It's winter in Michigan.\" \"Correct. Then you sat down at the computer to start writing,\" She adds. \"Let's see what comes out on the page.\" She's taunting me, I think. Well, I can't help it. I am thinking. Solitude does that to me. Maybe I just want to hibernate and say, leave me alone! I'd take a serious attitude cartusienne , wearing a robe as monks do at La Grande Chartreuse monastery, deep in the French Alps, where people have chosen to isolate themselves so that nothing can trouble their connection with the Divine. I remember a one-time visit to the section of this French monastery that was now a museum. I walked alone down a shadowed corridor with cubicle-like portholes outside the cells into which meals were placed twice a day. From here the monk would retrieve his food. Oppressive stone walls, isolated cells and high-walled garden spaces. Why would anyone choose this? I longed for a retreat back out into the world. Only a few years later I saw the film Into Great Silence, a two and a half hour display, without dialog or music, of life in this voluntary retreat into prayer. In silence I watched the winter sunlight change across the floor of a stark cell and then move to rest for a moment on an orange in a wooden bowl by the single window. In silence I looked directly into the faces of individual monks, some young and some old, who stood one by one in front of the camera. In silence I watched people seated in prayer, then standing in a kitchen preparing food. I could see that this condensed life was not hibernation, for it appeared to expand beyond the confines of thought or meaning. Did they understand something I didn't? Help! Too much! Thinking. Solitude. Thinking about solitude. The nuances of seclusion lead to an unfrequented place, surely some wilderness. I could go live in a yurt in the Himalayas. Get away from the noise, the cacophony, of the man-made world. I feel like a clam closing tight to create the most luminous pearl...the soul, only, one. Can I get squeezed pure in solitude? Is there a voice I want to hear? Or none at all? I don't know. I'm just going to don my alpaca sweater, brew some tea, and take a look outside to see what winter really is. ### (Diane Kimball can be reached at lilydetang@hotmail.com .

It can be a time of great fear, or a time of transcendent clarity. In order to facilitate the ease of our transition, we need to change our narrative of birthing. We are invited to move irrevocably beyond the narrative that holds Birth - this emergence of something new - as necessarily painful, dangerous, unsafe, even terrifying. We need to understand the difference between awe and terror. Terror is sourced in the past, whereas awe exists in the expansive present. Birth is awesome. The phrase 'Birthing the New' is not about building new bridges or new ways to boil eggs - these are the bringing into form of what is already in creation, the implementation of an existing design. Birth is always transformational, for it is a portal between what was and what will be. Birth brings the New that is nameless into form so that it can be named. The New can seem frightening - it has never been before, and no matter how we prepare for it, we cannot yet conceive of it except in whispers, little tendrils of possibility that we sense but cannot yet know. It is tempting to want to label this Newness, to define it, and describe it in terms of what we already know, but thankfully all such attempts must fail. Our challenge is to let the future be new, and not limit or distort it by loyalty to the past which is all we yet know. To birth the New, we need to embrace transition, the transition in consciousness in which we are all engaged. Some practice for this transition with war drills and austerities, some by drawing into the intimacy of family and friends; others choose to stay focused on what is now and what the next best steps seem to be, trusting both the outcome and the guidance. We each in our own way contribute to the collective outcome of the future we are imagining into being. In these times of transition, we are asked to reach beyond what we yet know or understand to new possibility - to the Unknown. The Unknown is not a singular domain - there are worlds of Mystery yet unknown, of Beauty we cannot yet imagine, and Silence that we cannot even begin to parse into meaning. We can reach for the Unknown, not in fear, but in confident awareness that there is Goodness, Truth, and Beauty beyond where our imaginations can presently reach. We can allow ourselves to savor the delicious feeling of what this might be like. To facilitate ease-filled transition, we consciously open ourselves to Wonder, and to that pure state that is true Innocence. By opening to Wonder and Innocence, we invite and invoke Thalia, first of the Muse of Awakening; we step into her field of resonance, and let her be the inspiration that opens us to New Possibility. She will activate the Initiation that brings us in confident awareness through the Portal of Birth into the domain of manifestation. We ask wonder-filled questions. I wonder ..... Will we release what no longer serves the emerging new and be in gratitude for all that has brought us this far? Will we surrender to a wonder-filled future we cannot yet know? Will we change our conception of Birth to being awesome, ecstatic, orgasmic? Are we willing to feast on the daily miracles of life? Will we learn how to be in suspense, in healthy expectation and anticipation? Will we learn to script our real-life movies with magical story lines full of amazing synchronicities, serendipitous encounters and miraculous happenings? So much wonderment. Sometimes it seems we imagine this might be boring, or that if we don' t control it by imposing our limited concepts of the past, it will be saccharin. Rather the contrary - life that is not sourced in this open hearted embrace of the Unknown will turn out to be empty of true nourishment, rather than full of the sweetness of Life, with all its wonder and innocence. So practice the discipline of Wonder and Innocence each day; open to the eternity of Beauty in a moment - red berry against winter's blue sky; needle of pine green with life in crystalline cold; the exquisite vulnerability of a loved one' s face. And then when you return from your moment out of time - for wonder and innocence are both timeless - both you and the world will be changed, for wonder brings you to a whole new perception. Let us engage wonder as we embrace transition and open joyously to Birthing the New . We each become conscious players on the great screen of each other's lives. There are no good or bad players, only more or less willing participants. Take time to welcome transition in this time of New Birth. Transformation awaits. And so it is. ### (Bronwen Gates, PhD, is an herbalist, teacher and healer.

The Crazy Wisdom Community Journal January - April 2011 Page 24 by Robert Thibodeau of Mayflower (Editor's Note: Robert Thibodeau is the highly regarded, long-time owner of one of the country's great metaphysical bookstores, Mayflower Bookshop, in Berkley, Michigan. He is also an organic backyard gardener, spiritual researcher, author, and a folk rock 'singer-songwriter' with 2 new cds just released: 'Wonderland, Songs of the Wild Midwest' and 'Second Chance Moons, Songs of the Wild Midwest of the Heart'.) \"May the rains of lava, blazing stones and weaponsFrom now on become a rain of flowers,And may all battling with weapons From now on be a playful exchange of flowers.\"-Shantideva, A Guide to a Bodhisattva's Life, 10:9. It is a Promethean task to wish that all beings find happiness and the wisdom knowledge of the causes of happiness. This is and was the goal of all sages in all ages, to awaken the compassion mind, to awaken the mind light of the spirit self, to awaken co-creativity with the whole of earth, even the future destiny of the world. To participate and be interactive, co-conversant with all the world in freedom and loving kindness, wisdom and compassion, truth and love has always been the highest goal. What happened?!? Maybe Halloween and winter have it right. Maybe the secret is in the dark time, the dark space/time, silence and emptiness. \"The people who sat in darkness saw great light; and to them which sat in the region and shadow of death, light is sprung up.\" -Gospel of Matthew , 4:16 Metaphysically speaking, darkness comes first, then light. It's more than my goddess gave birth to your god. It's more like, how can we converse if there is no silence? Even the gardener knows that, without light, nothing blooms or comes to fruit. But without darkness, nothing germinates, roots, and holds ground. Listening stillness is perhaps selflessness. Open centered emptiness may be the willingness to learn. Silent contemplation and yogic concentration may well be the golden key to unlocking the seven seals or chakras of enlightenment. When we recognize and acknowledge trouble, conflict, and suffering, a compassionate space can be created for compassionate action to arise. Think of the darkness of the garden compost and pulling weeds. \"Hello Darkness My Old Friend, I've Come T o Talk With You Again...\" -Song 'The Sound of Silence' by Simon and Garfunkel It's reminiscent of the first rule of yoga from the first book on yoga by Patanjali: 'Listen NOW, YOGA is the ceasing of the modifications or changes of the mind'. Meditation begins here. In the dark silence, the quiet mind sits still in the heart awaiting the voice of the silence, only then new light emerges, unconditional re-orchestration of the whole life emerges. 'Guru' means from dark to light; you have to get to the dark first. The ancient India Upanishad invocation speaks: Lead me from the unreal to the Real; Lead me from darkness to Light; Lead me from death to Immortality. Have we been going the wrong way all this time? Looking forever for light and love when in darkness of night every garden dreams better futures? In the Gnostic Gospel of Pistis Sophia, Jesus reveals to his disciples, \"the mysteries of the Light of the Father,\" and tells them: \"Do ye seek after these mysteries? No mystery is more excellent than they which shall bring your souls unto the Light of Lights, unto the place of Truth and goodness, unto the place where is neither male nor female, nor form, but Light everlasting\". Many sacred scriptures speak of darkness or ignorance alchemically transforming into the light of love and wisdom. 'Dark Night of the Soul' is one. Or is it an injunction to transcend opposites? Carl Jung's evocative title to his great work, 'The Mysterium Coniunctionis: An Inquiry into the Separation and Synthesis of Psychic Opposites in Alchemy'. Think of it as the mysterious conjunction of the sun and moon, inner and outer, spirit and matter, purusha-prakriti. Jung knew the secret processes of alchemy, yoga, and healing. First you separate the gross, dark matter, prima materia, from the subtle body; then purify; then a re-uniting or communion takes place at a higher level. Goethe speaks in Faust:\"W edded couples seeking bliss Let this wisdom guide you;The recipe for love is this,that first we must divide you.\" The Secret of Light - Crazy Heart Wisdom \"In this noisy bright bling world, dark silence is in. So let's bring on the dark, turn off the light, and wait for the stars.\" \"After that, it's all about rising and opening to the light. Making sense, making magic, making wisdom out of this crazy world; that is crazy heart wisdom for sure.\" \"May each of us discover and find our unique way, and may the world find peace and wholeness. Om Tat Sat! May we be that!\" The Crazy Wisdom Community Journal January - April 2011 Page 25 Patanjali's Yoga Aphorisms calls for a ceasefire, a quieting and silencing of the mind. This first step in yoga is to stop 'going through changes' and sit still at the center. If full of light, go dark; in stillness, listen. Yes, and if you are too dark, turn on the light of common sense and reason. Look for a new balance. In this noisy bright bling world, dark silence is in. So let's bring on the dark, turn off the light, and wait for the stars. \"In darkness we do all we can, in daylight we're oblivion; our hearts so raw and clear.\" -Dougie MacLean, 'Turning Away' The heart is the seat of the soul and throne of true mind. Stopping the noise and chatter of the head-mind and 'world-go-round' is the beginning. Listen to the listening heart for new work, wonders, and powers of 'wish'. The mind asana of the heart, sitting still in the heart, while observing a spark of starlight at the brow or forehead ( See Robert Thibodeau's cd talk: 'Heart Meditation' or his cd talk 'Divine Yoga Sutras', soon in book form). Here is an intimate relationship and dance of life. Between head light and the crazy dark wisdom of body, the rainbow appears in the open heart. Many spiritual practices consist of discriminating between the two, purification, and then later, a conversing, re-acquainting, a uniting. There is no need to wait, the time is now. Quick, breathe into your heart, empty everything there and listen! \"With half-closed eyes focused on the tip of the nose, the mind steadily fastened [on its object], and the active prana current of the ida and pingala nadis suspended [by guiding it into the heart's sushumna], thus the yogi reaches the state of realization of Truth in the form of a radiating light which is the source of all things, and the highest objective to be reached. What higher state is there that one might expect?\" -Hatha Yoga Pradipika with Tsongkapa's wisdom insight. It is in the re-creating of heaven (star) and earth (spells heart) that new worlds are born, new opportunities and insights emerge. Breathe in and let go! Winter Solstice, in the cycle of the year, is the deep breath within. It is a journey into the birth of light. Perhaps even the awakening of the old Greek 'Christos', the Solar Logos, the wisdom/love/will of the sun which is a spark awakening in the dark womb of the heart. It is the Festival of Lights, the birth of Krishna, Mithras, Horus, the sun hero. \"On earth as it is in heaven...\" -Jesus the Christ, The Our FatherHow can one ascend if one hasn't descended yet. All the great ones went down to help those less fortunate. This is why I AM into the descended masters, not the ascended ones. How can one climb the tree unless one' s feet are firmly on Malcuth, earth. The way up is the way down sayeth the old Greek philosopher Heraclitus. Only then, from the ground of emptiness, heart, can one then rise. \"Direct your [inner] gaze upon 'light' by slightly raising the eyebrows. Then perform shambhavi mudra as you have learned it. This induces samadhi. Some confuse themselves by the alluring promises of the shastras and tantras, others by the Vedic Karmas, and still others by logic. None of them recognize the real value of this mudra, by the aid of which one can cross the ocean of existence.\" -Hatha Yoga Pradipika Until then, crossing, or making the proper passage or 'passover' from head to heart necessitates that you have a head to start with. Seeing the future is seeing the promised land, the heart of wisdom and compassion, the interlaced triangles of spirit and matter, heaven and earth meeting in the heart to birth mindfulness, light, bodhimind, Mana, Spirit-Self (call it what you will). To see, incarnate, manifest such ideal is a first step to root. After that, it's all about rising and opening to the light. Making sense, making magic, making wisdom out of this crazy world; that is crazy heart wisdom for sure. \"He was not that Light, but was sent to bear witness of that Light. That was the true Light, which lighteth every man that cometh into the world.\" -Gospel of St. John, 1:8. I am not pushing any particular religion. I think that when the crazy heart wisdom awakens, all the religions make sense. Our job is to put virtuous ideals into our will, our actions. Our job is to willfully think. Our job is to be heart-centered in our going, coming, flowering; in our ability to still listen. The eastern way is a unity. The western schools all taught a trinity, a three-foldness. Me, you, and the intelligent space between and around for starts. Atma, the highest God (Father Archetype), the causeless cause and rootless root of H. P. Blavatsky. The second was the Word, Christos, Logos, Buddhi-Manas, Life Spirit, the love of Dharma or duty. The third was the Holy Spirit, the Spirit-Self of Rudolf Steiner, the Manas of Blavatsky, the light of dharma for the Tibetans. Each of us is the Fourth Way. We are the four-fold initial ordering revealed in the gospel of St. John the Divine, the Four Noble Truths of Buddha, and Steiner's 4 fold Foundation Stone Meditation. It is hidden and revealed everywhere in sacred scripture: open always and all ways to the wisdom eye of the heart. It is the Tetragrammaton, Pythagoras' Tetraktis. It is Plato's cross upon which the World Soul, humankind, is hung, strung, and en-nobled. It is the Native American's four directions, the four Vedas, the four elements. Plato said, circa 500 BC: \"The World Soul is crucified in time and space within each individual\". Thus, the World Spirit/Soul is rose rooted or rosy crossed in every human heart, in every mindstream continuum. We are spiritual beings with a body and soul. May the physical body find its soul in the world of virtuous merit. May the soul find its light in the Spirit of the World. May the World find itself in each and every Heart awakened in love and truth. \"Words are mere sound and smoke, dimming the heavenly light.\"GOETHE, Faust \"The terrible truth is, until everything disintegrates, unless one truly meditates, one can't see the light. Let your virtuous deeds melt the world in truth and love.\" -Trebore Tau Bodhi Yoga and Meditation can quiet the mind into the heart of understanding. Here, light and universal word (logos) kiss in the dark. Here, World Word vibrates in the heart of darkness, matter. Spiritual psychic surfers, dharma verb bums in akashic science and arts, write the poetry of eternity on each moment. The voice of the silence reverberates orgasms of insight and future proclivities of art, science, and the religion of street reality, as well as in kings and queens. Here, one cannot err, one always converses with plants, trees, the total environment. Sleep reiterates the spirit verbatim, the resonance, the truth of a love making all meaningful. There is a worldly materialistic light wherein we see dif ferences and act out of separateness causing unnecessary suffering due to not understanding the true nature of self. The self being the MIND of light and love, wisdom and compassion, always dancing in a mother/father relationship of redeeming the past and birthing the future - here now is crazy heart wisdom. Think as fast as you can, it's always past. Everything one does with the lower third of the body, food/exercise/sex/limbs/metabolic/will, is the future. The heart is NOW, the present; the child of the past and father/mother of the future. Be here now is the power of now. There is a light born within the dark that awakens the light of virtue and joy . There is a holy quiet listening spiritual darkness within that can be betrayed by anger, jealousy, hatred, ignorance and delusion. There is a rainbow of possibility open to each of us to explore our own spirituality in freedom and joy. There is an open road, and dharma for limitless joy and compassionate truth. It is each of us waiting in the stillness, the dark, the crazy heart. May each of us discover and find our unique way, and may the world find peace and wholeness. Om Tat Sat! May we be that! May the Light of Truth Eternal, whose echo throughout the ages keeps alive each heart, enkindle spiritual imagination and inspiration of the way . May the highest intuitive truths enlighten our mind and quicken our hands and feet, incarnating compassion's loving kindness in this dark world of electric lights. May all beings find joy, happiness and dharma (freedom) mind. May the Light of Truth Eternal, whose echo down the ages keeps alive the spark of Spirit, enkindle our soul minds with spiritual courage and crazy heart wisdom energizing our each unique way to the party.The secret of light is that we make it shine. Be still and know... ### (Robert Thibodeau can be reached at 248-547-8227, and his website is: http://web.mac.com/mayflowerbookshop.)\"Metaphysically speaking, darkness comes first, then light.

We had been friends for 54 years. I moved to Burlington, Iowa from Chicago with my family when I was 16. Paul and I became friends almost immediately in that summer of '55. Paul and his family had come to Burlington a few years earlier from St. Louis. We were both kids who had been displaced from a big city and had a shared and, we thought, superior cosmopolitan attitude toward small town Burlington. We both listened to blues radio from Louisiana and sent away for boxes of 45s by the likes of Muddy Waters, Little Willie John, and Joe Turner. Paul was very cool. He was handsome. He had a distinctive dancing style made all the more impressive by his large body which he moved gracefully. He had an infectious laugh and, how shall I put it, a Rabelaisian (which means lustily humorous) sense of fun. He had a steady girlfriend and their relationship was, how shall I put it, more advanced than anything I had yet encountered personally. Paul had been a Golden Gloves boxer and could throw impressive punches with his large hands. Before I arrived in town he, unfortunately, received a broken jaw in the ring from a local fighter named Cowboy Carlson. That incident was part of the folklore of Burlington High School. But Paul was never a bully. On the contrary, at times he himself suffered racial insults because of his dark skin color inherited from his Cherokee mother . Once a motorcycle gang leader tried to push Paul around. Students gathered in a vacant lot to watch the confrontation. A few punches were thrown and the motorcycle tough guy came away with a bloodied face. To me it was something right out of Rebel Without a Cause. Paul's family lived in the upper floor of a large house with a view of the Mississippi. We spent much time there hanging out. I remember going over there late on the night I lost my virginity and telling Paul the details. Since I've known Paul I have always felt that, wherever Paul lived, from that humble room with a view of the Mississippi to his house in Palos Verdes with a view of the Pacific, I was welcomed with generosity. This was the Big Daddy aspect of Paul. His home was gathering place for old friends. After college and law school, when he had some money, his home was always a place where I felt taken care of with food, drink, and Dionysian laughter .

Paul and Richard at Santa Monica Beach, in 1984.\"What the hell's goin' on? I'm tryin' to get some sleep.\" It is a silly, childish prank but the subtext is sinister: Brando is toying with a guy he' s been hired to hunt down and kill. Sometimes, out of nowhere, Paul would say , imitating Brando, \"What the hell's goin' on?\" It was an example of his absurdist sense of humor and also part of a private language we shared. Paul watched The Wild Bunch almost every year, and so did I. When Sam Peckinpah died in 1984, he sent me an obituary. After Paul moved to southern California in the early 70s, there was a hiatus in our relationship until 1979 when I visited him in Palos Verdes for the first time. He took me twice to a club where the flashy blues saxophonist \"Big J\" McNeely was playing. Paul had gotten to know \"Big J.\" It took me back to our high school days when we danced to live blues on a riverboat that came up the Mississippi from St. Louis. Paul and I revisited the Mississippi at four class reunions over the years and spent time on the river drinking and reminiscing with our high school buddies in a classmate's boat. At the 2002 reunion Paul was selected the funniest classmate, a long overdue honor . In 2004, Paul, Pat, and I went to see my ex-wife Linda in San Diego six months before she died of cancer. When Paul called me in Ann Arbor to tell me she had died he cried uncontrollably. The man with the infectious laugh could also shed large tears. I last saw Paul two years ago. After our 50 th high school reunion in Burlington we drove to Iowa City, where my philosophy mentor Ed Allaire happened to be visiting. Paul had taken classes from Ed as an undergraduate. We all had breakfast together. I felt at the time that this was a wonderful meeting with two men who had a more sustained influence on my development than any others. I also felt that the meeting was not likely to happen ever again. For the past thirty years Paul and I have spoken by phone about once a month. When I wasn't home he left a message on the machine that almost always began: \"Hey, F**k Stick, where the hell are ya?\" For a moment I felt I was sixteen again. It's going to be an adjustment getting used to a world without Paul's large presence in it. (Richard Gull is Professor Emeritus of Philosophy from the University of Michigan. He taught at the University of Michigan-Flint from 1965 until 2007. In January of 2010, he and his now late wife, Sara Schreiber, co-authored and self-published a book about her struggle with cancer, titled Turning Darkness into Light: A Memoir.)The Crazy Wisdom Community Journal January - April 2011 Page 27 Paul was the hope for success in his working class family. He was a serious student. He had confidence. In college, where we took many classes together, he asked questions of his professors and easily got to know them personally. That same confidence made him a good defense attorney. Paul majored in philosophy as an undergraduate and I majored in economics. Then, ironically, he got a law degree and I got a Ph.D. in philosophy. He often sent me articles about philosophers and wanted to know what I thought. I once asked him whether he thought I would have made a good lawyer. He said he thought I would have made a good appellate judge. This meant, I think, that he considered himself more streetwise in court than I could have been. I still feel underestimated on that score but, like I said, the guy had confidence. I was best man at Paul's and Pat's wedding in '62. If Paul was Big Daddy, Pat was his Big Mamma counterpart. It cannot always have been easy being married to such a large personality for 47 years. They raised three children together. But Pat was strong and understated. Paul and I shared a passion for certain films, especially westerns, and lines from them became recurring references in our conversations. Of course, there was the classic \"We don't need no stinking badges\" (from Treasure of the Sierra Madre). But, more obscurely, there was Brando sticking an insect into a sleeping Randy Quaid's open mouth in The Missouri Breaks. Quaid wakes up startled while Brando is now pretending to sleep. Then Brando pretends to be awakened by Quaid's noise and says For the past thirty years Paul and I have spoken by phone about once a month.

Namaste II cd For Hindus and now for many others as well, the greeting of choice is namaste, the two hands pressed together near the heart with the head gently bowed . Namaste means I bow to you, acting like a simple yogic asana, balancing and harmonizing our energies, keeping us cen-tered, inwardly poised and mentally protected. The beautiful music on Namaste II is ideal for contemplation, introspection, and yoga.

Anyone can play a drum and enjoy a drum circle.\" \u2014 Lori Fithian (Pictured above)Drumming Up the Gifts/Drumming Down the Blessings By Mary Runser Photography by Doug Russellince the earliest of times, drumming has been a part of nearly every human culture. Drumming was used as a way to communicate across distances, the rhythms and cadences expressing the news of birth, death, celebration, and war . Throughout the ages, drumming has remained an integral part of those cultures, and now drumming circles are taking on a renewed popularity in many communities around the world. Drumming circles offer gifts and blessings by fulfilling several basic needs of people within a community. First of all, as Lori Fithian of Drummunity explained, drumming and drumming circles are just fun. \"Anybody can play a drum, really . It's not hard to hit a drum with your hand or with a mallet. It's not as difficult as you might think to maintain a beat, and, before you know it, you're having fun and making music.\" Certainly there are rhythms that are more intricate and require more focus and concentration to maintain, but when you are gathered in a group of people and you suddenly realize you're making music together, it's quite a remarkable moment. Curtis Allen Glatter, who leads monthly drumming circles and workshops through the Mind, Body, and Spirit Wellness Center, explained that \"when it comes to drumming circles, there is no requisite level of expertise. Drumming is for everybody , from the absolute novice to the accomplished musician. Everybody has something to offer, from four years old to ninety-nine and over.\" While most of the circles have a facilitator, there is no real leader in the group. The facilitator's job is to get everyone started with a simple beat. As people join the group and gain a bit of comfort, different and varying beats can be added. \"There are people who believe that they have absolutely no musical inclination whatsoever ,\" Lori said, \"but really that just isn't true. Anyone can play a drum and enjoy a drum circle.\" Drum circles can also be intentional. \"One Dance, One Drum, One Heart,\" an event sponsored by Drum4Wellness and the Interfaith Roundtable of Washtenaw County this past fall, was one such event. The goal was for the participants to experience a celebration of self, community, and spirit through drumming, dance, and chanting. The evening opened with community drumming and led into chanting and drumming in the four directions, based on the Native American Medicine wheel. The drumming, the music, and the sound was different for each direction/element. The drumming/chanting/prayer began in the south, which is the element of water and represents all the emotions, both positive and negative (i.e., happiness, sadness), because the body has to experience all of them and learn to keep them in balance, in order to maintain heath. Next, west is the element of earth, which represents the physical and teaches us to hold our spirits in our physical bodies. Earth is the element that keeps us grounded and helps us to be in the moment. North is the element of air , which represents the mental and encompasses all of our thoughts and beliefs. And finally, east is the element of fire, which represents the spirit, the unique life force that is you. While drumming to the four directions/elements, my mind was able to go places and visualize those elements, perhaps in part because I had recently been to see the awesome beauty of Lake Superior (water), and also to appreciate the beauty of the mountains (earth) in West Virginia. Now whether this was an experience of an altered state of consciousness or recall, I'm not sure. But I The Crazy Wisdom Community Journal January - April 2011 Page 31 Drumming offers many blessings, such as: stress release, personal growth and empowerment, cooperation, listening skills, diversity awareness, spontaneity and creativity, musical/rhythmic expression, relaxation, wellness, and community- building and connection.Drumming Up the Gifts/Drumming Down the BlessingsDrum Circles and Classes, and Drum Teachers Drummunity with Loti FithianMonthly drum circles in the Crazy Wisdom Bookstore Community Room.

I just simply allowed myself to be carried away on those rhythms to memories of the things I had recently seen. The Drum4Wellness event demonstrated another basic human need that drumming fulfills, that of achieving the serenity of an altered state of consciousness. The amazing experience of so many people from varying backgrounds joining together , many without ever having drummed together before, to make such wonderful music The Crazy Wisdom Community Journal January - April 2011 Page 32 was incredible. The energy in the room was palpable, rich and focused, with a grateful spirit for the bounty of the four directions. The evening ended with a meditative chant and dance that encouraged the body awareness of the individual and eventually extended out into the community of participants. Another basic need that drumming fulfills is building community. I used the word \"participant\" several times above, and with good reason. Drum circles are about participation, rather than performers and audiences. Drummunity, created by Lori Fithian, is a word that she invented to \"express the community-building that happens when people come together around a circle of drums.\" The energy of the drum circle is vibrant and infectious, and you can't help but want to join in. There are health benefits to drumming, too, as the name \"Drum4Wellness\" implies. Particularly interested in the wellness aspect of drumming, Lori trained under Dr. Barry Bittman, MD, neurologist and co-founder of \"Health Rhythms, \" a drum \"Studies have shown that drumming really does have a measurable and positive impact on the immune system. The Health Rhythms program epitomizes the amazing, versatile power to heal [that is] inherent in music.\" \u2014 Don Allen Drumming Up the Gifts/ Drumming Down the Blessings Continued from page 31Don Allen circle protocol for wellness centers. Research studies have shown that drumming has a direct effect on increasing the activity of white blood cells, the ones that do battle with and destroy cancer and other virally-infected cells. Dr. Bittman believes that drumming is a way of connecting the mind and the body for overall improved health. Drum circles are cropping up in hospitals, health centers, and wellness centers all across the United States and other countries as well. Lori, a graduate of the University of Michigan with a bachelor of fine arts degree, takes her Drummunity program into local schools and universities, private parties, outdoor community festivals, staff meetings, and international conferences, as well as to events such as Michigan Peaceworks rallies and marches, protest demonstrations, and 4 th of July parades. Don Allen of Drum4Wellness is also a trained facilitator of the Health Rhythms Group Empowerment Drumming program. \"Studies have shown,\" Don said, \"that drumming really does have a measurable and positive impact on the immune system. This program epitomizes the amazing, versatile power to heal [that is] inherent in music.\" Don takes his Drum4Wellness program to grief groups in association with St. Joseph Mercy Hospice and the Visiting Nurses Association of Southeastern Michigan. He also works with autistic children and their families through the Mid-Michigan Autism Association, and has worked with people recovering from drug and alcohol addiction, people suffering from chronic diseases, and community mental health workers. In addition to being a professional drum circle facilitator , Don is also a professional musician and teacher. \"It is my interest in and love for music and the healing arts that have led me to the art of drum circle facilitation,\" he explained. Don is also a member of the Tree of Life Drum and Dance Society based in Chelsea, Michigan, which teaches about and performs music of West Africa and the Caribbean at music festivals, special events, and schools throughout Michigan. Drumming also fulfills an individual's need for a creative outlet and self- expression. Drum circles aren't always about following a certain pattern, rhythm or beat; rather, they can be as varied in approach as the people who participate. \"Many people don't understand that there doesn't have to be a certain beat played,\" Curtis said. \"In a circle, we may start out drumming a certain beat, but it' s also okay to play multiple beats over top of that main beat. Drum circles are also about being creative, having fun and finding out what you can do with a drum.\" An accomplished drummer, musician, composer, improviser and poet, Curtis seeks to find as many ways and objects as possible to create his music. His compositions have premiered with Trummerflora Collective, Detroit Symphony, Pontiac Oakland Symphony and the Camarada Ensemble. Once a month, he hosts a drum circle at the Body, Mind, Spirit Wellness Center in Ann Arbor, where he encourages participants to play different styles as well as different instruments, and to just enjoy the amazing creative spirit that is inherent in a drumming circle. Curtis enjoys working with children because they don't tend to have the shyness or hesitance about self-expression that adults tend to display. \"It's fun to mix that child-play with something that adults can play and learn as well. I wish that adults could just let themselves go the way that kids do.\" Drumming is making inroads in areas that one might not expect. Major corporations such as Sprint, Hewlett Packard, and Verizon have all begun to use drumming circles for creative expression and team-building among their employees. \"In many ways,\" Curtis said, \"drumming circles allow you to see and appreciate the beautiful gifts that others have to offer.\" Drumming can be a way to put aside differences and to see and allow commonalities to be born and to thrive within a community. As part of my research for this article, I participated in drum circles sponsored by Lori, Don and Curtis. I am not a professional drummer, but it is something that has held my interest since attending the Womyn's Music Festival in Hart, Michigan several years ago. So, I bought a djembe and set about attending these circles, drumming out music with many people whom I didn't know. But, it didn't matter that I knew no one, or that I was new to the groups, because they were welcoming and encouraged everyone to join in and make music. It still amazes me how easy it is to sit with a group of such diverse people and be able to make such awesome music. The circles were fun and instructional at the same time. Now that I've attended some drum circles, and have my own djembe, I absolutely will go back and drum again! I love it; it's so tribal and instinctive in many ways. Nearly anytime I am listening to music, you will catch me drumming out a beat... on the table, my leg, the steering wheel in my truck. I now drum at home alone, and have found it to be an amazing creative outlet. When I sit down to write after drumming, words and creative thoughts seem to flow more smoothly and readily .

All of the drum circle facilitators I spoke to believe that drumming is a gift that everyone can experience. And as Lori Fithian summed up, drumming offers many blessings, such as: \"Stress release, personal growth and empowerment, cooperation, listening skills, team building, diversity awareness, spontaneity and creativity, musical/rhythmic expression, relaxation, wellness, and community-building and connection.\" If you have an interest in drumming, and even if you don't, I encourage you to try at least one drum circle.

Drum circles are about participation, rather than performers and audiences.Drumming Up the Gifts/Drumming Down the Blessings Continued from page 33 Curtis Allen Glatter The Crazy Wisdom Community Journal January - April 2011 Page 35 By Lindsay Passmore A few years ago, I signed up for a drum class and learned a great secret: playing drums turns out to be a pathway to deep inner presence. Drumming is not an activity of the brain. To hold onto the beat and listen to many rhythms being played at the same time, you let the body take over. Once my hands learned a few basics, I found out why so many people love creating rhythms with others. Free from the chatter of my mind, I found a place of deep inner stillness underneath. I fell into drumming around the same time I started another activity: being with hospice patients near their time of death and singing very softly to escort them along their journey. Apart from these experiences, I had also begun a meditation practice based on consciously connecting my breath. All of these things began working on me in surprising ways. More in tune with the joyful presence within, I began releasing emotional habits that had burdened me in the past. Here is my attempt to describe that opening at the time. I am starting to understand a new way of being, a way of sitting more deeply within myself. At times, I am able to meet others in this place, too. There is aliveness and joy in this way of being that is different from anything I have known. For me, it is a precious place. I think of it as a sacred place. Music is one way I find this connection to deep being. My drum teacher, Paul, described it perfectly. The aliveness, he said, comes from dwelling in your center while at the same time surrendering to the complex rhythms of the drum. Your arms and hands are creating all this movement, and your body is receiving a whole matrix of vibrations; and if you are drumming in a circle, there is the added dimension of weaving your own rhythms with those of the other drummers. And yet within yourself, you can be silent, you can be grounded. You can be in a still place. When the mind and body are able to both create and receive the vibrations, and yet underneath hold onto the stillness, there is an expansion, a quality of joyful spaciousness. There is a way of being united with everything that exists in the present moment, and riding that moment into the next one, and into the next one, and into the next. Paul calls it \"drum awakening.\" I first noticed how music can take me to this joyous state of inner expansion a few years ago when I started singing with some friends on a weekly basis. Even something as childlike as singing in rounds can evoke it. As with drumming, I love hearing my own part while fully opening up to the rich layers of other voices. The more complex the song, the wider I have to expand to experience the stillness of my own voice within the larger tapestry of harmonies. Sitting inside a place of inner quiet while creating with my voice feels something like playing in a drum circle. It stretches me into a vast and beautiful interior space. When I am able to bring this spacious embrace to situations involving emotional pain, the expansion is deeper still, and healing can take place. I think this must be what any good therapist or priest practices regularly. I get to practice it in the Threshold Choir, singing at bedsides with a couple of other women to people who are struggling and often at the threshold of death. When we are at a bedside, we sing very, very softly, re-creating the gentleness that we may have experienced as babies being sung to by our mothers if we were lucky. We do not try to \"send\" healing, but strive rather to embrace what is, moment by moment. Each song we offer contains a universal truth that is sung over and over like a lullaby, getting softer and softer, and slower and slower, so that its message can gradually sink in. We choose songs that fit the belief system and personal circumstances of the person to whom we are singing. If we sense that it is right, we add some softly layered harmonies. Our words, music, and intentions work together to open access to a field of deep peace and safety, a loving place where the dying person and loved ones can be however they need to be. Settling into the emotional space of a bedside, it is possible to fully hold the fear or sorrow of the people in the room, yet sing, at the same time, to their absolute wholeness. There is something heartbreakingly sweet about this. This sweetness is so vast that my heart swells and swells - I have to open wide to contain it. It isn't at all like having sympathy for someone. There is no judgment here about whether what is happening should be happening. There is just a radical acceptance of what is, a complete container for all that exists in the present moment. The music, offered in this way, opens a doorway for release. When Threshold Choir members are not singing at bedsides, we rehearse songs and open ourselves to that field of healing vibrations by singing to one another. We have a reclining chair, and anyone who is struggling with anything can lie in the chair in the middle of our circle and be sung to. Sometimes I have kept my eyes open and looked at my dear friends while they tenderly sang to the truest part of my being. I don't know which touches me more deeply, the giving or receiving of this loving gift. We always allow a moment of silence after a song ends. In the quiet, I often feel shivers down my back. I feel changed. I have had precious experiences in solitude of bringing this fullness of being to my own fear or sorrow. These experiences are imprinted on my soul as episodes of grace, healing moments that brought back to life aspects of my self that I buried long ago. They have occurred during my own meditative practice in which attention to the breath is used to focus awareness in the present moment. When you breathe without pausing, like babies and animals do, the breath begins to move old, unintegrated emotional experiences to the surface. It is challenging, but possible, to breathe through episodes of resurfacing pain, while at the same time offering unconditional love and tenderness to the aspect of your being that originally buried it. Allowing myself to completely re-experience such raw emotions, while simultaneously bringing forth another part of my being that can wholly welcome and embrace my suffering self, is a bit like playing drums or singing at bedsides, but infinitely sweeter. It stretches me into a well of love that is so pure and so deep, I can hardly believe it exists inside me. I do not believe this quality of love is something I can manufacture myself. But I can open to it. Resting in that place of healing, where I can be fully myself in the presence of such sweetness, the old pain can reach a state of completion. It is allowed to be, without judgment... and then it is finished. And where there was once a missing fragment of my being, there is joyous reunion. There is freedom. There is peace. There is overwhelming gratitude. ### (Lindsay Passmore may be contacted at: lpassmore@toast.net.) drum, Voice, and breath thr ee Paths to Wholeness My drum teacher, Paul, described it perfectly.

The Weeping Tree By Colette Anne Gehr We can learn a lesson from the mighty elm in the forestthat bears heartless scars from others but still continuesto blossom and flourish despite its damages.We can trace with our tender fingertips the gaping wounds,some jagged and deep, others delicately drawn,of betrayal, broken promises, and forgotten love,while the humble giant weepsfor comfort, for compassion, for validation.We can witness the large, oval tears dropping to the forest floor,watering the mossy ground and newly sprung violets beneath.And, we can have faith in knowingif a supple sapling can withstand the winds of change,the rain of melancholy, and the torment of quiet isolationwhile still bravely opening their budsto the warm kiss of springafter bearing the bitterness of winter,we too, can be just as resilient.We too, can gracefully endurethe injuries made upon our gentle soul.We too, can escape out of the darkness and bathein the unfailing ray of light sprinkling the forest floor.We too, can experience rebirth once again.All we have to do is rememberthe strength of the weeping tree.Poetr y Artwork by Sara Van Zandt Comprehensive.

As communities of faith, we have a special responsibility to call each other and our society to extend God's Gift of Love to all. We affirm the ultimate value of families: that every child deserves a loving parent, and every person a loving family;that families are people who commit their lives to each other through unconditional love, nurturance, guidance, and mutual support;and include each and every person who makes this sacred commitment to a child or a partner. The Divine Gift of Love comes to all of us equally - to people of all sexual identities, gender identities, and sexual orientations. In loving one another, we cherish and honor God's Gift of Love. When women love men, when women love women, when men love men, and when men love women, we cherish and honor the Divine Gift of Love. (This is a portion of the Washtenaw Faith Action Network's Statement of Values)The Crazy Wisdom Community Journal January - April 2011 Page 38 A Look at Evolving Attitudes and Practices at Ann Arbor's Churches, T emples, Dharma Centers, and Spiritual CommunitiesNote: Those interviewed for this article use different formations of the acronym for \"gay, lesbian, bisexual and transgender\" (GLBT), Q standing for \"queer\" or \"questioning\"). However, I've chosen to use the acronym GLBT throughout, for the sake of brevity and consistency. Finding a spiritual \"home\" isn't always an easy task for gay, lesbian, transgender and bisexual people. Though attitudes in many spiritual and religious organizations have evolved toward members of the GLBT community over the last few decades, many religious groups still have strong prohibitions against homosexuality . Other organizations may be accepting of GLBT members, but won't ordain openly gay and lesbian leaders or perform same-sex marriages. As I was finishing this article, for instance, the leadership of the Presbyterian Church (U.S.A.) approved ordaining non-celibate gays and lesbians, but continued to debate the issue of whether to change the definition of marriage \u2014 thus allowing for same-sex unions \u2014 within the denomination. Those kinds of struggles are going on in a variety of spiritual traditions at the local level as well. However, in Washtenaw County overall, the religious landscape is quite welcoming to members of the GLBT community. There are so many gay- and lesbian-friendly congregations and spiritual organizations in the area that those mentioned in this article don't comprise an exhaustive list, but merely a sampling from a variety of different spiritual paths. Gay and Lesbian Spiritual and Family Life \"Who am I \u2014 who is anyone \u2014 to suggest how love ought to be expressed?\" ~ David Bell, the leader of Ann Arbor's Interfaith Center for Spiritual GrowthBy Sarah Rigg Photography by Doug RussellThe Interweave Group Members, consisting of GLBT and their allies.Definitions of GLBT-friendly As I began my research and interviews for this story, I assumed the greater Ann Arbor area would be a good place for the GLBT community to find accepting spiritual organizations, because it's a university town with a reputation for tolerant and progressive thinking. However, as I talked to spiritual leaders and congregation members, I found that definitions of being a GLBT-friendly spiritual community vary greatly. For some groups, for instance, being GLBT-friendly means having an active outreach program or special services for GLBT members. St. Andrew's Episcopal Church, for example, offers an Oasis Ministry, with a special Evensong service on the first Saturday of each month. \"Oasis provides a safe, welcoming space for people with different sexual orientations and gender identities,\" said Oasis Program Coordinator Joe Summers. He said the group not only serves members of St. Andrew's but also works with other area churches that want to be welcoming and affirming of GLBT members. At the Ann Arbor Unitarian Universalist Church, a social justice group called Interweave welcomes GLBT members and hosts a potluck on the third Tuesday of each month. \"The Unitarian Church in Ann Arbor became a 'welcoming' congregation \u2014 that's the designation that lets people know LGBTQ people are welcome \u2014 in 1992,\" said Joan Burleigh, planning team coordinator for Interweave Ann Arbor. \"Over time, people assumed that LGBTQ people were welcome (at the Unitarian church), but nothing was going on to provide an authentic welcome to people who came through the door,\" Burleigh said. \"As new folks came, what we were hearing was they couldn't find one another and were wondering how 'out' they could be in that space. That's when we started Interweave, in 2007.\" In addition to providing a safe space for GLBT members to meet one another and socialize, Interweave also sponsors occasional programs or forums with breakout discussion groups. The aim of the forums is to educate the rest of the congregation about issues such as gender identity, transgender issues, or how to be an ally to somebody in the LGBTQ community, Burleigh said. At the University of Michigan's Jewish student group, Hillel, a subgroup called \"Ahava\" (Hebrew for \"love\") welcomes GLBT students and their friends, and hosts special events. Rabbi Nathan Martin, Assistant Director at Hillel, said that Ahava has put on \"fabulous programming\" around GLBT issues at the university and holds events in conjunction with the Spectrum Center, the GLBT student group at the University of Michigan. For other spiritual groups in Washtenaw County, being GLBT-friendly means that one's sexual orientation is simply nobody else's business. David Bell, the leader of Ann Arbor's Interfaith Center for Spiritual Growth, called sexual orientation a \"non-issue\" in his community. \"I try to make it as clear as possible, that (sexual orientation) is simply not an issue,\" Bell said. \"Who am I \u2014 who is anyone \u2014 to suggest how love ought to be expressed? We have a few folks who are gay and lesbian and come regularly and feel quite comfortable.\" Bell said that sexual orientation \"can't even begin to be an issue\" because of the organization's view of spirituality, which is that all living beings are an expression of divinity. \"We view the so-called prohibitions that are contained in certain biblical passages or the Koran or whatever document as, simply, very ancient expressions of fear,\" Bell said. \"Most of what passes for religion in the world today is what I consider a fear - based control device, and it's totally antithetical to an understanding of one-ness.\"Rob Henderson, senior druid at Shining Lakes Grove, a gathering of neo-pagans in Ann Arbor, also referred to sexual orientation as a non-issue. \"I think we're friendly,\" Henderson said. \"We don't have a sub-group for GLBT members. We have several GLBT members, but it's not something we make a big deal about.\" Henderson said that his group's tradition doesn't have \"any divine commandment from above saying anything good or bad about homosexuality. It's a non-issue.\" He said that, while the group bases some of its rituals on ancient cultures that were not gay-friendly, Shining Lakes Grove has a modern sensibility. \"We're very accepting, and those ancient (views of homosexuality) just don't apply.\" Sharada Kumar, the acharya (spiritual teacher) at the Chinmaya Mission Ann Arbor, said that while she's not aware of any \"out\" gay and lesbian members, she'd have \"no objection\" to someone from the GLBT community attending. \"Whatever their preferences are fine with us,\" she said, adding that there' s \"no particular opposition\" to homosexuality in the Vedantic organization's teachings.The Crazy Wisdom Community Journal January - April 2011 Page 39 Washtenaw Faith Action Network's How to be a Welcoming Religious Organization\u2014What can a Congregation Do? 1.

There's a strong emphasis on being inclusive congregations that welcome all.\" ~ Joe Summers, Oasis Program Coordinator at St. Andrew's Episcopal Church Continued on page 40 Terry \"Chajang\" Beamsley, administrative assistant and senior member of the Zen Buddhist Temple in Ann Arbor, also called sexual orientation a \"non-issue.\" \"We do not attend in any way, shape, or form to people's sexual preferences,\" Beamsley said. \"One of our precepts refers specifically to not abusing sex. Not abusing sex, to us, means not being unfaithful, not essentially using someone' s body merely for pleasure. However, it doesn't in any way, shape, or form talk about what kind of person your partner should be, only about showing love no matter who that person should be.\" Ann Arbor's Temple Beth Emeth is also GLBT-friendly, in a low-key way. Rabbi Robert Levy said his community is welcoming, but doesn't have a specific outreach program. \"We do have gay and lesbian members,\" Levy said. \"Some churches make announcements that they have an outreach, but we don' t have a specific outreach. We consider ourselves open to all Jewish people in Washtenaw County.\" A third definition of gay-friendly involves actively working on issues of interest to the GLBT community, such as advocating the legality of same-sex marriage and related social justice issues. In Washtenaw County, the Ann Arbor Friends (Quaker) Meeting and the associated American Friends Service Committee have been, and continue to be, advocates for social justice for the GLBT community. For instance, there was a movement in 2002 to remove a clause in the charter of the city of Ypsilanti that prevented discrimination based on sexual orientation. The Ann Arbor Friends, members of St. Andrew's Episcopal Church, and several other area churches were at the forefront of the fight to retain the protections in that clause. These groups were also involved in protesting the passage of an amendment to the Michigan Constitution in 2004 that made it unconstitutional for the state to recognize same-sex marriages or civil unions. In 2008, the Michigan Supreme Court interpreted the amendment to mean that employers could not offer domestic benefits to same-sex partners of employees. \"Ann Arbor is kind of a hub for work around the state within respective faith communities, bringing people together to work toward ending discrimination and prejudice in Michigan as a whole,\" Summers from St. Andrew's said. \"For instance, in February, Oasis worked with the Michigan ACLU (American Civil Liberties Union) to hold forums to talk about how to challenge legalized discrimination from the Supreme Court.\" Changing times, changing attitudes Spiritual organizations in the greater Ann Arbor area also vary in how long they've been GLBT-friendly and where they are in the process of becoming more welcoming. Some religious organizations have been welcoming and affirming of gays and lesbians from the beginning, while others have changed their policies and practices quite recently. Barbara Brodsky, guiding teacher and spiritual director for Ann Arbor's Deep Spring Center for Meditation and Spiritual Inquiry, said the center has been GLBT-friendly from the beginning. \"I see no prejudice within the Deep Spring community,\" Brodsky said. \"I can't say this is a change. Part of our practice is looking deeply at opinions and fixed views and the ways these lead to suffering. So people may arrive with prejudice but do look at it in practice, and I'd guess they either are able to release it, or simply cease to speak of it.\" Many Christian denominations are still in the process of examining how they approach GLBT-related issues. For the Quakers in Ann Arbor, the route to becoming an affirming congregation was a long one. Decisions about welcoming GLBT members and performing same-sex marriages are left up to individual regional organizations in the Friends tradition. U-M Sociology Professor Emeritus Max Heirich is a gay Quaker who has seen attitudes toward these issues change at the Ann Arbor meeting. He has been involved with the Friends Meeting and with the American Friends Service Committee since he was in college, working on peace and social justice issues. The Crazy Wisdom Community Journal January - April 2011 Page 40 (Joan Burleigh is planning team coordinator for Interweave Ann Arbor, a social justice group that is part of the Ann Arbor Unitarian Universalist Church. Interweave is a mix of Gay and Lesbian folks and their straight \"allies\" at the Unitarian Church, and it plays an important role at the church in helping to create a comfortable and welcoming environment for the Church's GLBT members. Many other faith communities have \"allies\" helping to support their GLBT membership and bring along the rest of their faith congregations.) What does it mean to be an \"ally\" to GLBT members of your church?Allies welcome LGBTQ persons and their families to full participation in all aspects of our faith community. The success of our Interweave group comes in large part from LGBTQ folks and allies working together to transform ourselves, the church and the greater community. You mentioned that older members of the Unitarian Church would ask you, \"Well, why are you involved in this?\" What is your answer? I want to be a part of a vibrant, beloved community that honors the dignity and humanity of every person. My participation in Interweave gives me an opportunity to work toward this goal and to celebrate the lives of all of our members. How do allies help to move faith congregations to become more welcoming? And why is it important? Gay folks receive messages of rejection everyday in the media and from some religious groups. They are denied equal rights in our state and country. Allies can help faith communities create a loving space, a refuge that's sustaining, a place of welcome and full inclusion. Active allies have the power to be transformative within their faith communities. ###Why It Matters -- A Few Questions for Joan Burleigh about Being an Ally to GLBT Folks in Your Faith Community\"The national church in the past said yes, you could be a pastor if you are homosexual, but not if you practice. Now, after this decision, it's just much more open. Some of us are very pleased and surprised that it happened, but thankful because some of us have been working for a long time for full inclusion.\" ~ Gretchen Bingea, Pastor of Ann Arbor's Trinity Lutheran ChurchGay and Lesbian Spiritual and Family Life Continued from page 39 In the future, Joe Summers said he'd like to see people stop focusing on terminology \u2014 such as \"union\" vs. \"blessing\" vs. \"marriage\"\u2014 and start focusing on how to support families of all kinds. Photo by Doug RussellTrinity Lutheran Church in Ann Arbor has been ministering to members of the GLBT community for many years, but has only started blessing same-sex marriages in the last year. And, the leadership at the national level has only recently allowed gays and lesbians in monogamous partnerships to be ordained. \"That had always been a sticking point before,\" Trinity Pastor Gretchen Bingea said. \"The national church in the past said yes, you could be a pastor if you are homosexual, but not if you practice. Now, after this decision, it's just much more open. Some of us are very pleased and surprised that it happened, but thankful because some of us have been working for a long time for full inclusion.\" Among Jewish groups, different traditions are further along the path of acceptance, Hillel's Rabbi Martin said. \"Generally, liberal Jewish movements in this country, which form 70 to 80 percent of the Jewish community, are all very welcoming and open to LBGT participation,\" Martin said. He added that some traditions within the Judaism spectrum have been doing it longer than others. \"They're all on different places on the curve,\" Martin said. Ordination and leadership Many spiritual and religious groups in the Ann Arbor area are also friendly and welcoming of gays and lesbians serving in leadership roles. Among Jewish groups, the Orthodox movements do not recognize gay and lesbian clergy, Martin said, but \"All of the liberal Jewish movements ordain gay and lesbian rabbis. That being said, the Reform and Reconstructionist movements have been ordaining gays and lesbians for much longer. The Conservative Jewish groups decided just a few years ago to do that, and it was a big deal for the Conservative movement to make that change.\" Levy of Temple Beth Emeth said that 15 or 20 years ago, the reform movement's seminary opposed ordaining anyone who was gay, but the rabbinical association said it would accept anyone of any sexual preference. Levy said the egalitarian view of ordaining gays was very political a few decades ago, but the support is \"solid\" now. \"Liberal religious groups found it was a foolish prejudice to hold,\" Levy said. \"As people started to question this in liberal religious groups \u2014 including liberal Christians \u2014 barriers melted away.\" Christian groups vary widely in their stance on ordaining gay and lesbian leaders, but the trend has been toward more openness. \"There have always been gay priests, not only in the Episcopal Church but in any other denomination you care to name,\" Canterbury House chaplain Reid Hamilton said. (Canterbury House is a ministry to University of Michigan students, faculty , and staff that is sponsored by the Episcopal Diocese of Michigan.) \"And there have been lesbian priests since we started to ordain women in 1979. We've certainly had gay bishops throughout our history as well. What's changing now is that we're sort of more open about the sexual orientation of our clergy and more prepared to affirm their identity as gay and lesbian people.\" Summers also confirmed that \"in Ann Arbor, a number of our clergy are gay and lesbian. There's a strong emphasis on being inclusive congregations that welcome all.\" However, Summers said the topic is still somewhat controversial nationally. \"We just ratified the second openly lesbian new bishop from Los Angeles and there was some opposition from the Anglican Communion,\" Summers said. Marrying same-sex couples Though same-sex unions can't be legally recognized in Michigan, clergy from a number of faith communities perform same-sex ceremonies. Summers said that in the local Episcopalian diocese, clergy are free to perform same- sex blessings. \"I've been at the church since 1987, and that's gone on at least that long,\" he said. But while same-sex wedding ceremonies are performed at St. Andrew's and other Episcopal churches, the liturgy hasn't been updated. \"At the national convention, they called for development of a litur gy for blessing same-sex unions, but there's no approval of a liturgy at a denominational level,\" Summers said. \"It's left up to individual diocese to determine whether they do same-sex couple blessings or not.\" He said a book by British Friends called \"Towards a Quaker View of Sex,\" published in 1963, was groundbreaking in its acceptance of homosexuality and started conversations at Quaker meetings all over the globe. Locally in Ann Arbor, he said the Friends meeting had attracted gay and lesbian members for years, but those members had been \"very quiet about it, including me,\" he said. Then, around 1985, the questions of welcoming gay and lesbian members and performing same-sex marriages started to come up repeatedly at the national, regional, and local levels. Quakers, Heirich said, make decisions slowly, discussing everything in detail until a consensus or \"unity\" has been reached. When the GLBT-related issues started popping up at the Ann Arbor meeting, a small group was formed to discuss the issues and then take their findings to the whole group. \"We began talking and finally decided to draw up a proposal for consideration in the larger meeting,\" Heirich said. He admits to being a little na\u00efve and thinking approval of the committee's proposal would be easy, and was surprised at the resistance the committee encountered. \"Some of the members were not aware I was gay, and one man said we should be studying our Bible and the Bible doesn't approve of that lifestyle. I was in my 50s at that time, and another man said people in their 50s shouldn't encourage people to follow lifestyles that will bring them great pain and grief.\" \"I was shocked,\" Heirich said. \"I had not outed myself and felt very wounded about these comments.\" Discussions continued for seven years, Heirich said, and some members of the community were beginning to become discouraged, when a new meeting clerk decided the discussion had gone on long enough. (There isn't a strong formal leadership structure in Quaker meetings, but the assemblies elect a clerk each year to serve as a leader.) The new clerk decided that the meeting needed to reach \"unity\" on the subject by finding common ground. \"He said, first, we understand everyone is equal in the sight of God. And second, we understand that we don't marry anyone\u2014 the couple marry each other\" in the sight of God, and members of the meeting are merely witnesses to that commitment. A new proposal was put forth that same-sex couples would go through the same counseling sessions that opposite-sex partners do in the Quaker tradition, and those who wanted to witness the ceremony could do so, and those who didn' t feel comfortable could simply not attend. Heirich said that, while not everybody was enthusiastic, about 80 percent were happy and most said they could live with the decision. Those who were still not convinced decided not to stand in the way, a move the Quakers call \"stepping aside\" on a decision so as not to compromise consensus. Over time, Heirich said, the meeting witnessed more and more same-sex marriages, and became friendlier to out GLBT members. Quaker meeting attendees wear name badges, and today Heirich and some others wear rainbows on their badges, so visitors and new members can find other gays and lesbians at the meeting.

It was nice, and it worked! They've just been very accepting and loving toward me.\" Reid Hamilton of Canterbury House agreed. \"The marriage liturgies need thorough revision and updating,\" Hamilton said. \"The marriage liturgy we have right now just carries forward some assumptions, both with regard to role of men and women in marriage, as well as some sort of built-in heterosexism we simply need to address.\" Other area ministers I talked to for this article who have performed or are willing to perform same-sex ceremonies include David Bell of the Interfaith Center for Spiritual Growth, Rob Henderson of Shining Lakes Grove, Robert Levy of Temple Beth Emeth, Barbara Brodsky of Deep Spring Center, both pastors from Trinity Lutheran, Reid Hamilton of Canterbury House and Haju Sunim of the Zen Buddhist Temple. Bell said he's performed same-sex unions, but only a few, saying it was \"a mystery\" why he didn't get asked to do them more often. He said he's tried to make it clear that all of the ministers at the Center are open to performing these ceremonies for couples, regardless of sexual orientation. Henderson said he's open to performing same-sex ceremonies. \"I've always offered to do same-sex blessings, but no one has asked for it.\" Levy said same-sex celebrations happen \"irregularly\" at Temple Beth Emeth. \"I call them weddings, even though they're not legal,\" he said. \"It's not a question of some sort of lesser ceremony.\" Anna \"Poppy\" G. is a member of the Tsogyelgar Dharma Center in Ann Arbor and was married to her same-sex partner in a ceremony there. (She didn' t want to give her last name, since she works for a conservative law firm and said she \"still lives in a world where not everyone is as accepting\" as the leadership at Tsogyelgar.) She describes the Tsogyelgar community as \"absolutely accepting.\" \"Our teacher married my partner and me, and it was a very joyful celebration, part of a summer retreat,\" she said. \"There was a flower girl, we had a quartet with people playing cellos. The whole community gathered in a big field with a grove. We exchanged vows and they blessed our marriage. It was a beautiful ceremony .\" Not only did the community bless her partnership, but they also were instrumental in helping her find a partner, Poppy said. \"For a long time, I was the only gay person there,\" she said. \"They do practices in the Buddhist tradition to draw you a partner or a lover, and they did that for me. It was nice, and it worked! My partner, who is also Buddhist, started coming (to Tsogyelgar) about 10 years ago. They've just been very accepting and loving toward me.\" At another Buddhist organization in Ann Arbor, the Zen Buddhist Temple, Senior Teacher Haju Sunim said she has performed a Buddhist wedding ceremony for same-sex couples on several occasions. \"The ceremony is the same as for heterosexual couples, except as the partners wish to make any changes or additions to the ceremony,\" she wrote in an e-mail interview. Brodsky said same-sex marriage ceremonies aren't much different than ceremonies for opposite-sex partners at Deep Spring Center. \"The Buddhist sutras do not have any prohibition against same-sex union,\" Brodsky said. \"The prohibition is against that which does harm.\" She said when she's officiated at same-sex ceremonies, she met several times with the couple and talked about what their vows will be, what they envision, and what concerns they might have. \"They were really no different than any other wedding,\" she said. Joan Burleigh said that historically, there have been several same-sex weddings performed at the Ann Arbor Unitarian Universalist Church, adding that the most recent one was last fall. She said members of her congregation have also performed political action work and education at the national level in regard to the issue of same-sex marriage. Heirich said that after the Ann Arbor Quakers came to \"unity\" on the subject of same- sex marriage, it wasn't long before a couple asked to be married at the Ann Arbor Quaker meeting. The couple in question made it a political issue by applying for a marriage license at Ann Arbor City Hall, which garnered media attention and some negative reactions from local people. The Crazy Wisdom Community Journal January - April 2011 Page 42 Heirich said he and other meeting members were worried there might be protests during the marriage ceremony, but everything went smoothly. Since then, the membership has witnessed a number of other same-sex ceremonies. At Trinity Lutheran, Bingea said that she and the lead pastor had always expressed that they were welcoming of all people, but the issue of blessing same-sex unions came to a head last year when they were asked to perform such a ceremony . At the national level, it is left up to the discretion of individual Lutheran pastors and congregations whether to bless same-sex unions, she said. \"We got a request from two of our members, a lesbian couple, to actually perform a same-sex blessing in the church,\" Bingea said. \"It had never been done before.\" That request brought about a congregation-wide conversation that lasted many months, she said. \"So it came to a point where we opened up the discussion and process to talk about what it'd mean, the implications if we allowed for same-sex blessings in the worship space,\" said Bingea. Ultimately, the congregation held a vote last year and same-sex blessings in the worship space were approved. The first ceremony for a same-sex couple was performed last summer. When both pastors came out strongly in favor of performing same-sex blessings, Bingea said she knew there would be some negative fallout. \"We have lost a few families who don't want to raise their children in a church where this is permitted, because of their own personal beliefs and values,\" Bingea said. \"And some congregations have left the Evangelical Lutheran Church of America, too. Lutheran churches around the country have a process they can go through to leave the ECLA. That hasn't been widespread in Michigan, but there was a congregation in Canton that made the decision to leave our denomination over this issue.\" Bingea said the leadership knew they might lose people over the decision, but they also believe they have gained members for the same reason. \"We firmly believe that people have been attracted to our congregation because of that stance and because they want to be a part of a community that's welcoming to all people,\" she said. Toward an egalitarian future Many of the clergy and lay people I talked to for this article have expressed a lot of optimism about how attitudes are changing toward the GLBT community and same-sex marriage. For instance, Summers said that urban areas have typically been the place young gay people go to find acceptance, but even the more rural Episcopalian congregations have started to become more open and accepting in recent years. In the future, Summers said he'd like to see people stop focusing on terminology \u2014 such as \"union\" vs. \"blessing\" vs. \"marriage\"\u2014 and start focusing on how to support families of all kinds. Bingea said that change is coming to Lutheran congregations and other Christian groups slowly but surely. \"It's just a matter of time,\" she said. At Trinity Lutheran, although her congregation ultimately voted to allow same-sex ceremonies, she said the vote wasn't the end of the matter. \"After the vote, some people felt they had 'lost.' As pastors, we always tried to listen to what the concerns were,\" she said. \"If we thought people were having a hard time, we'd listen and have discussions with them.\" She said that in addition to one-on-one discussions, the congregation also had more formal discussions during the Sunday morning education hour , looking at the scripture verses that pertain to the issue. \"There are only seven scriptures that even mention (homosexuality), and none of them talk about monogamous, loving relationships,\" Bingea said. \"Most of those passages are more talking about a negative expression of power through the use of sexuality.\"Gay and Lesbian Spiritual and Family Life Continued from page 41 Over time, according to U-M Professor Emeritus of Sociology, Max Heirich, the Quaker meeting witnessed more and more same-sex marriages, and became friendlier to out GLBT members. Quaker meeting attendees wear name badges, and today Heirich and some others wear rainbows on their badges, so visitors and new members can find other gays and lesbians at the meeting. \"Ann Arbor is kind of a hub for work around the state within respective faith communities, bringing people together to work toward ending discrimination and prejudice in Michigan as a whole.\" ~ Joe Summers, Oasis Program Coordinator at St. Andrew's Episcopal Church Barbara Brodsky, guiding teacher and spiritual director at Deep Spring Center for Meditation and Spiritual Inquiry, said same-sex marriage ceremonies aren't much different than ceremonies for opposite-sex partners at Deep Spring. \"The Buddhist sutras do not have any prohibition against same-sex union,\" Brodsky said. \"The prohibition is against that which does harm.\"Ultimately, Bingea said that her congregation's ministering to those who were still unsure or opposed to same-sex marriages was to emphasize what all Lutherans have in common, instead of the issues that divide them. \"We tried to talk about what our bonds were, what held us together,\" Bingea said. \"The struggle is, how do we stay together when we disagree? The foundation of our beliefs and our faith are greater than any differences with this issue or any other political issue.\" She said she is also pleased that after such a long time, she can describe her congregation as a \"fully accepting and affirming\" congregation for the GLBT community and everyone else. \"Many said this day would come,\" she said. \"I was pleasantly surprised that, in our case, it came last summer.

Currently she is working on her MSW at EMU while teaching at Slauson Middle School. \"The parenting of four children at home and two in college is what I love most.\" She also loves camping, traveling, art, music and being with friends. Her partner, Carol Kennedy, has a home day care license, and she began her home day care business almost 20 years ago. Carol received her degree in Early Childhood Education from Northern University. Carol has always been involved in choirs and loves being a member of the choir at the Unitarian Universalist Church.) Bill Zirinsky: Please tell us about your family. Your partner? And how many children do you have, and their names and ages? Theresa Bassett: My partner, Carol Kennedy, and I met more than 25 years ago. Carol has a home day care license, and she's been doing that for about 20 years. Carol received her degree in Early Childhood Education from Northern University . Our family came together through adoption and birth. Our kids are: Maya (19), Olivia (18), Ben (15), Charlie (12), Sam (7) and Finn (4). Bill Zirinsky: Where were you raised? And what church did you go to? And how do you remember your religious upbringing? Theresa Bassett: I was raised Catholic and attended St. Thomas Catholic Church. I don't have many fond memories of church but then again, I don't know many people who do! I remember being told a lot of things during preparation to go to confession, or for my first communion or confirmation. I don't remember discussing anything and that is probably why I didn't find it very interesting. I am a questioner . Going to college, I left the church, and for five or so years, dabbling, until Carol and I went to the Unitarian Universalist (UU) Church on Washtenaw. We have been attending since 1989. In the last year or so, three of my sons and I have been attending the Zen Buddhist Temple, as well as the UU church. Bill Zirinsky: And where is Carol from and what is her religious background, and what was her relationship to her church? Theresa Bassett: Carol is from Birmingham, Michigan, and she was raised Protestant. She was involved in the group in a religious sense, but like myself, didn't have a sense of 'belonging' to anything in a spiritual sense. Music was important to her then and still is to this day. BZ: Theresa, you mentioned to me that your Catholicism created a \"body memory\". Please elaborate. Theresa Bassett: Even after not being involved in the Catholic Church for 20 years, I remember everything in an almost unconscious way from genuflecting, the smells, what to say, when to say it, when to kneel, it is all an automatic response. Just smelling the incense can take me back to an earlier time. BZ: So, then, what aspects of your Catholic background do you appreciate? Theresa Bassett: More and more, I appreciate the ritual of the mass and the 'bigness' of it all. I also have found that there is much in the lessons that I can appreciate, that at one time was lost in the delivery. I don't remember the church as compassionate or loving. However, I have since had amazing experiences with individuals (like the late Father Bill from St. Mary's) whom have had an impact on me. Father Bill was genuine, compassionate, and seemed dedicated to social justice. BZ: When did you and Carol meet, and when did you venture to the Unitarian Church, and why? Theresa Bassett: Carol and I met at Interlochen where we were both waterfront directors. I think we both wanted something that would give our lives purpose but didn't sense that either of our past practices were the way for us. We had heard a lot about the UU church, and so, in 1989, we decided to try it out. Reverend Ken Phifer was the minister at the time and it proved a great match for us. Ken delivered sermons that we thought were provoking and insightful. We also found that within the church were a growing number of women's circles and we both found a circle to be involved with. Being part of a religious community that also met our spiritual needs. This church was interested in service, justice and was actively working on issues of homophobia and racism. BZ: And were you married within the Unitarian Church (or have a commitment ceremony)? Please tell us about that. Theresa Bassett: Reverend Ken Phifer performed a commitment ceremony for us. Not legally recognized, that commitment to each other was important and is still celebrated to this day. With Ken's help, we made the ceremony our own. We closed with the Apache Blessing : Now you will feel no rain, for each of you will be shelter for the other.Now you will feel no cold,for each of you will be warmth to the other.Now there will be no loneliness,for each of you will be companion to the other.Now you are two persons,but there is only one life before you.May beauty surround you both in thejourney ahead and through all the years,May happiness be your companion andyour days together be good and long upon the earth.The Crazy Wisdom Community Journal January - April 2011 Page 45 Gay and Lesbian Spiritual and Family Life in Ann Arbor An Interview with Theresa Bassett on being a Lesbian Mom with Six Kids and a Fulfilling Spiritual Life in the Unitarian and Zen Buddhist Communities Continued on page 46 \"I would love to know that they value and honor our family for all of the things we bring to the community, but in the end, I think it just comes down to the fact, that we, like all parents, love our kids and want the best for them.\"Theresa Bassett (on the right) and her partner, Carol Kennedy, and their son, FinnIn 2008 we traveled to California with our children in what was an amazing, one month long road trip. We were able to have a legal ceremony performed, with our children present, at the UU church in San Francisco, as the State of California was still recognizing gay marriages. I had wanted to pull something from our original ceremony to link to this ceremony but was unable to find what I was looking for . At the end of the ceremony, the minister read the Apache Blessing . Carol and I were both astounded and felt it was an amazing coincidence or kismet, if you will. BZ: Has the Unitarian Church been welcoming to you and other gay families? Theresa Bassett: Very much so. Gail Geisenhainer, our minister, is an integral part of creating a welcoming atmosphere. We also are involved in a movement called 'Standing on the Side of Love', which is very supportive of the rights of the LGBTQ community, immigrants and their families. Church is a safe haven for us all. The culture is such that our lives, our children, our commitment is honored. The respect for our community is woven into the religious education curriculum, wording, and symbols. The Interweave group (LGBTQ and allies) meets monthly. BZ: At that time, in 1989, commitment ceremonies and gay/lesbian weddings were less common. What do you recall of the community spirit evident at your ceremony at the time, and did you feel supported on that day? Theresa Bassett: We were surrounded by friends, some who are still close friends to this day, who were all wonderful and supportive. It was everything and more than we could have hoped for. BZ: Your parents were initially \"reluctantly supportive\". Has that evolved, and how and why? Theresa Bassett: I think many parents initially struggle with some of their kids and the directions they take. My parents were no different. I think it is doubly hard when parents don't have support in the way of friends, family or their church. Time is this wonderful thing. It allows people to accept new ideas and grow. BZ: You said to me that \"kids are so healing...how can you hold on to that --reluctance\"...please talk about that. Theresa Bassett: It is really hard to not love when it comes down to it, especially a small person who is so dependent and so darn sweet! Many families that I have talked with see a shift in their relationship with their parents once children enter the scene and parents embrace grandparenting. It is more about love and less about judging. All new parents need love and support and I think parents, regardless of where they are in terms of acceptance, don't want to see their children struggle or hurt. This is my experience, but I do know sadly, this isn't everyone's experience. BZ: You are also part of the Zen Buddhist Temple. How did that come about, and how is your involvement there meaningful? Theresa Bassett: Part of the curriculum at the UU church is the 6 th grade class called Neighboring Faiths . In this class, the group visits other places of worship to get a better understanding of other religions. After visiting, Charlie, for whatever reason, really liked the community of people, the meditation and the warmth of the place, both spiritually and physically (they have a wood burning stove in the winter!). Charlie asked if we could go back and we did. Charlie has now found out that there is a children's group so he has left me! I go, work on my meditation and Charlie and his friends work on building forts, meditating, and other fun things. There is much in common between the UU Church and the Buddhist Temple. They share a lot of the same values including community and relationships. The delivery is just different. They are not mutually exclusive. I find much that I enjoy in both. BZ: So, you've managed to blend an interest in Buddhism and meditation with your connection to the Unitarian Church. Please tell us about how you view that blending. Theresa Bassett: If you walk into the UU Church, you are likely to see Glen Thomas Rideout leading us in song together, sometimes with drumming, lots of clapping, our minister singing, ... a raucous affair. There is a small time for reflection. At the temple, it is mostly a time for reflection and some storytelling but it is very grounding, whereas I would say the UU church is very uplifting. The two together give me balance. I love the singing and dancing that goes on in our sanctuary as much as I love the silence of the temple. And I love that my children also get this duality of ways to worship. They are both incredibly spiritual to me in the moment. BZ: You said to me that you \"find the spirituality in any place I go to\". Please say more. Theresa Bassett: Being a UU has given me the opportunity to find respect in ways that others worship. I think there is a spirit or a fire or a light or an ener gy that moves within a group, no matter how that group chooses to worship, and I would like to think I am open enough to find it. Whether it is the Quakers or the Evangelical, the Catholic mass or the pagan ritual....there is something that I can find that I appreciate and enjoy. Something that touches my soul. Something that makes me think and moves me. BZ: You talked to me about wanting your kids to \"spread their roots laterally\". Please elaborate. Theresa Bassett: I didn't invent this idea on my own. If a tree has a strong tap root, just one big root going down, that tree is much more susceptible to being uprooted in a storm. If the roots also grow out, laterally and down, they hold. I want my children to be able to draw on as many faith traditions as possible in a respectful manner so that they have those roots that grow in all directions. Who knows what they might find comfort in, in a time of need? I want them to be healthy and happy and if that includes finding spirituality in other forms, I support that. I don't think we have the one answer. I think the answer comes in many ways. BZ: Does the \"hetero-centeredness\" of our culture weigh on your children at all, as kids with two moms? How? And how have you and Carol worked with that? Theresa Bassett: Being raised in a hetero-centered, racist culture, sometimes I'm not always aware of the ways in which it affects us. Forms, assignments and word usage that assumes that my children have both a mom and dad can be interesting. As a teacher, there may be a concern in the classroom, and it feels like you have addressed it, but then something else comes up and again, something else. At some point, I think to myself, \"this isn't about homework or seating arrangement....this is about something deeper\". Although I do have pictures of my family in my classroom, I am careful to not 'broadcast' or go overboard in my display. I don't want to be accused of promoting a specific agenda, although some of my colleagues could be guilty of that in a heterosexual sense. My children have been lucky to be surrounded by people who are welcoming, not just accepting. There are times, infrequent as they may be, that either as a couple or at times our children, have been overlooked or even excluded. Maybe having a gay couple included would make things awkward? Maybe having my children over to play means that they might have to have a conversation with their children about why we have two moms in our household? There haven't been too many situations where we have been overtly discriminated against. However, there have been many subtle and not so subtle oversights or assumptions made. Our kids are intelligent and can Gay and Lesbian Spiritual and Family Life in Ann Arbor \u2014 An Interview with Theresa Bassett Continued from page 45 \"It is really hard to not love when it comes down to it, especially a small person who is so dependent and so darn sweet!

In a perfect world we wouldn't have to arm them against racism and homophobia but until then, we do. BZ: You teach at Slauson Middle School. Where on the continuum from intolerance to tolerance to acceptance to welcoming do you find the school community, including parents, teachers, students and administrative staff? Theresa Bassett: Our school communities have only grown in moving along in acceptance of all families. My children have been lucky to have had teachers who truly cared about them. I would love to know that they value and honor our family for all of the things we bring to the community, but in the end, I think it just comes down to the fact, that we, like all parents, love our kids and want the best for them. And teachers, should also want the very best for their kids, all kids. We have a common goal. We have to focus on the things that we have in common and less on where we don't see eye to eye. And sometimes, we just need to be civil. We aren't going to necessarily agree with one another but we can be civil. AAPS does include sexual orientation in its non discrimination policy and that is important for not only me but for my kids as well. Those words do offer me some protection and are important. I feel very supported by my colleagues and my administrator, which isn't the case for some people. BZ: How do your kids understand people who are not so welcoming or accepting of your family? Theresa Bassett: We have tried to explain that some people just haven't had some of the same experiences with people of all backgrounds and that is ok. We will still go on trying to become the best people we can be which is understanding that people are in different places. We need to be respectful and caring.\"Although I do have pictures of my family in my classroom, I am careful to not 'broadcast' or go overboard in my display.

That's a spiritual endeavor, yes? Theresa Bassett: Yes. I want to believe that there is good in everyone. Sometimes it is hard to find but I do believe it is there. I also do believe that until we find common ground, whether it be between gay and straight, people of different races, ethnic groups, etc., we will not be able to dwell together in peace. BZ: What gives you the strength to be so generous in your attitude towards people who are less than welcoming to you and Carol and your family? Theresa Bassett: I think everybody is searching. At one point I might not have been so generous. It is a work in progress. I think most of the animosity is based in a lack of understanding and/or fear. As an educator, I always believe people will grow. BZ: What nourishes you? Theresa Bassett: I surround myself by things that give me strength. My family gives me joy and love. The communities at both the UU church and the Zen Temple support me spiritually, offer opportunities for service, and give my life meaning. I look forward to service each weekend to recharge myself. Forays out into nature with my children, meditation, drumming, singing, my women's circle and the sermons that challenge me; these all are food for my soul. It keeps me going all week long. BZ: Anything else you'd like to add? Theresa Bassett: I just am reminded about how rich my life has become since finding the UU church. We have met so many great people, enjoyed so many community events, shared sad times and glad times. We have celebrated Shabbat dinner with another UU family, participated in Seders, Pagan rituals, and more recently have enjoyed attending the Buddhist temple. I feel like my life is still expanding. The following is the chorus to a hymn called 'Gather the Spirit' by Jim Scott. It hits on why I come together with the UU community or the Buddhist sangha. Gather in peace, gather in thanks, gather in sympathy now and then. Gather in hope, compassion and strength. Gather to celebrate once again. ### (Theresa Bassett can be reached at: theresabassett1@hotmail.com.) (Pictured clockwise from left) Sam, Finn, Carol Kennedy, Maya, Theresa Bassett, Olivia, CharliePhotography by Rachael Waring (Debbie Zivan grew up in Rochester, New York. She' s lived in Ann Arbor since 1983, when she arrived to study Social Anthropology at U of M. Since graduating, she has worked in the field of health care satisfaction research. She is the mother of 17 year old twins, Misha and Orrin, who live in Missouri, and 10 year old, Brayan, who lives with Debbie in Ann Arbor, and goes to the Hebrew Day School.) Bill Zirinsky: Debbie, you were raised as a Conservative Jew. How did you feel about your early religious experiences? Debbie Zivan: Mixed feelings, very mixed feelings. Much of my time during weekly Shabbat services was spent flipping through the prayer book in an attempt to figure out how much longer the service would last. Getting dressed up to get more in touch with God didn't make sense to me. Hebrew school was marginally better \u2014 depending on the teacher. And what a range! From Mrs. Rosenfeld, a sweet older woman who invited kids to her home to experience an observant Shabbat; to Rabbi Hyman, who told me that asking why girls couldn't lead services was inappropriate. At home, religious experiences were short (due to my brother and me finding short versions of readings), sweet, and meaningful \u2014 we were all just a little more present for each other during these times. Bill Zirinsky: You described yourself as having had a \"spiritual bent\" early in life. Please explain. Debbie Zivan: Religious life stirred me up. I had strong feelings about services, about Hebrew school, about Shabbat, about holidays. Jewish life offered me the feeling that I mattered and belonged \u2014 good feelings. BZ: You told me that your camp experiences opened up your spiritual life. How? Debbie Zivan: I went to a Jewish sleep-away camp where there was a powerful synergy between religion/prayer and community: prayer created a deeper sense of community and the community took us deeper into prayer. Camp was an opportunity to experience life without a gap between who I felt myself to be and who I thought I was supposed to be. BZ: When did you realize you were lesbian? Well, that was a process. I was 11 when we were vacationing in Florida during the time Anita Bryant was opposing gay rights. I asked my dad for his opinion. He looked me in the eye and, with great sincerity, responded, \"If they are not hurting anybody, they should be allowed to live as they choose.\" That was a moment of realizing. Then, after a conversation with my friend's mom en route to my college interview, my friend told me, \"My mom is wondering if you are a lesbian.\" Another moment of realization. I embraced the lesbian label when my first girlfriend and I broke up, and I began wondering where I should search for community. BZ: Your parents were supportive of your sexual preference. But they wanted you to be with a nice Jewish girl, yes? Debbie Zivan: I can sum up my parents' thoughts simply enough: \"Keep the faith alive!!\" + \"Judaism is of great significance to Debbie\" + \"We want Debbie to have a fulfilling relationship\" = \"Find yourself a Nice Jewish Girl.\" BZ: You indicated to me that your parents really made sure to embrace your choice, and to then find their own spiritual community that would embrace GLBT values? How fortunate you were to have such love from your folks. Debbie Zivan: Incredibly fortunate! After sorting out their feelings, my folks wasted little time in becoming activists: They started a Jewish Parents and Friends of Lesbians and Gays (PFLAG) group, my mom spoke to audiences of educators and students, and my dad joined the national board of PFLAG. When they moved to Manhattan they landed at B'nai Jeshurun \u2014 a synagogue oriented to progressive social activism. Having responded to me with love and respect, they were ready for a community that was expansive in considering the relevance of Judaism in relation to a myriad of social issues.The Crazy Wisdom Community Journal January - April 2011 Page 48 Gay and Lesbian Spiritual and Family Life in Ann Arbor BZ: Your parents were supportive of your sexual preference. But they wanted you to be with a nice Jewish girl, yes?

Can you tell us about that? Debbie Zivan: I have 17-year-old twins who live with their mom, Mary, in Missouri. When the twins were in middle school, both physical and emotional distance was imposed on us \u2014 Mary felt uncomfortable with the twins having a non-traditional family. This distance is difficult and has had significant influence over who I am as a parent. I also have a son who is 10. Cheryl and I adopted Brayan from Guatemala when he was 2-1/2. Since then, Cheryl and I split, and we share parenting. Adoption, living in a trans-racial family, two moms, two houses \u2014 these are some challenges we are tackling. BZ: You veered from a strong connection to your Judaism for a good part of your younger adult life. What brought you back? Debbie Zivan: Instructions from the Beatles... \"Get back, get back, get back to where you once belonged.\" For some years, I'd attended High Holiday services with the same friend. Annually, we'd say to one another: \"This year, we'll find a Jewish community.\" Finally, enough momentum built up \u2014 based on desire for community, motivation to give Brayan a faith, finding the Havurah (see below), and Jewish institutions making strides toward inclusion \u2014 so that I managed to build a bridge back. BZ: You said, \"Being a Jewish parent totally resonates with me.\" Please tell us more. Debbie Zivan: It resonates with the rich quality of Jewish-infused moments we share: singing Hebrew songs, blessing Brayan on Shabbat, and dancing together at bar/bat mitzvah celebrations (clarification to protect my son's image: by \"together\" I mean at the same time, but opposite sides of the dance floor). These moments are potent doses of awareness of our relationship's significance. For me, being a Jewish parent is organic and practical. I have a bag of Jewish values. When I want Brayan to problem-solve or uncover meaning in a situation, I reach into the bag, pull out a value, and I've got the tool I need to begin a conversation. Recently, I was talking with a friend about an Israel-Palestine news item. Brayan piped up with, \"What was that about Palestinians?\" With Brayan listening intently (not something I take for granted) and the values of peace and compromise at the ready, I explained my feelings regarding solutions to the conflict. I want Brayan to possess a clear set of values and a go-to place to fuel up on meaning. Judaism empowers me to empower my kid \u2014 that resonates. BZ: You're involved in the Reconstructionist Havurah. Tell us about that, and is it welcoming to gay and lesbian members, couples, and families? Debbie Zivan: The Havurah is a small, intimate, jean-clad group of Jews (if inclined, it is acceptable to dress more formally for Havurah events). Intimacy is nurtured by a mindful approach to prayer/Torah/history/holidays, with the intent of keeping the faith relevant and vibrant. Torah teaches, \"Orphans are more susceptible to pain, so we must extend extra kindness in our dealings with them.\" The average Havurah member takes some personal responsibility for inclusion. They understand that gay people have been orphaned by our society \u2014 cut off from legal rights, family, and community. BZ: How has it been for Brayan, as best as you can determine, to grow up with a lesbian mom in Ann Arbor? And has the Hebrew Day School been a welcoming environment to you and Brayan as a multi-racial and non-traditional family? Debbie Zivan: The many gay/lesbian-headed families advocating for our families makes it a reality for Brayan to answer \"cool\" in response to the question, \"What is it like to have a lesbian mom?\" That being said, Brayan's biggest identity struggles are yet to come (similar to other kids, soon to enter middle school). I chose Hebrew Day School because I knew he would be treated as an individual, not as a demographic. The teaching staff has lived up to this expectation many times over. Due to the size and culture of the school, each student has a sense of presence in the community. I hope the experience of presence will make it possible for Brayan to feel how his relatively unique demographic serves him. BZ: \"Being a part of good in the world is important to me.\" You said that. How does that manifest in your life? \"Much of my time during weekly Shabbat services was spent flipping through the prayer book in an attempt to figure out how much longer the service would last.\" BZ: You veered from a strong connection to your Judaism for a good part of your younger adult life.

I walked out the door smiling and laughing. When I think about how being a part of good manifests in my life, that experience comes to mind. I walked into the store hearing some random notes and left hearing some harmony. I buy the notion that the energy from one moment is carried on to the next moment, and then the next one after that. \"Big good happens in small moments\" \u2014 a friend shared that with me recently while dutifully watching our sons play soccer in the freezing cold. It's the summary of an Episcopal priest's sermon. Those words speak to me in answer to this question.BZ: What else would you like to add, Debbie? Debbie Zivan: Well, going public by sharing my answers to these personal questions feels awkward, sappy, and preachy. Then I realize, regardless of how this sounds, I need to finish this interview so I can go have some more harmonious moments at the gas station! Other than that...I like the idea of living in a multi-faith and multi-cultural world and I enjoy being a Jew. It still evokes a stronger sense of mattering than I feel as an individual. I recognize this as an experience across all faiths \u2014 that the wisdom of each faith has the power to serve humanity and, in doing so, does a whole lot to keep each faith vibrant and evolving (credit to M. Kaplan, pioneer of Reconstructionist Judaism, for this notion). ### ( Debbie Zivan can be reached at dzivan@datastat.com .)\"Torah teaches, 'Orphans are more susceptible to pain, so we must extend extra kindness in our dealings with them.'

Craig Kukuk and AT Miller: We've been together since January of 2001, and married since June, 2006.BZ: What was your marriage ceremony like? Craig Kukuk and AT Miller: It was a Quaker ceremony hosted by Ann Arbor Friends Meeting, attended by about 300 people in our own chapel on our own land. We walked in to a piper under a large Oak tree, escorted by a Quaker elder and our two flower girls and two ushers\u2014who were all under the age of five. We wrote songs for each other and sang them, and everyone had an instrument under their seat for a large drum circle at the end. Since Quaker weddings were often \"doubted\" in terms of legitimacy in the past (because only God officiates\u2014there are no clergy), there developed the tradition of everyone witnessing by signing the wedding certificate (they are very large) saying that what they saw was a wedding. This is quite meaningful in our case. We also \"jumped the broom\" which is an African-American tradition dating to the times of slavery when the marriages of enslaved people were not recognized nor honored. Photos of the event can be found at: http:// a2host.us/craig-at/ BZ: And how did your parents and siblings and cousins and aunts and uncles respond to your marriage, and to the marriage celebration? Craig Kukuk: My dad has dementia, so he wasn't totally aware of what was happening, although he did sign the letter to the Quaker meeting from all four parents requesting the marriage, and at that time he definitely understood what was being asked, and although grumbling, signed it with my mom. My mom learned a lot from some Oprah shows and is incredibly supportive. Both of my sisters attended, and though they don't fully support \"gay marriage\", their love and support is endless, and they both welcomed AT in the family and consider him a full member. They were great, and a few of my cousins came. Most of my more distant relatives are not supportive and did not attend, though invited. AT Miller: A very large number of my relatives came, but it is a much larger family\u2014 cousins, nieces, nephews, aunts, uncles, and five of six siblings, along with my enthusiastic parents. The four children in the wedding party were my nieces and nephews from two of my brothers. Many members of Ann Arbor Friends Meetings also attended along with our friends and family of choice. BZ: How did you meet, and how would you describe your courtship? Craig: A Quaker friend invited us to dinner and neither of us was too impressed. But, a few weeks later, AT asked me out to go skiing (my favorite sport). AT is not so good at it, but we laughed and really clicked. We went to Africa together with AT's family members a few months later and it grew from there. AT: After the initial \"failed\" introduction (I did not know that I was a sort of blind date, so I did not really interact much with Craig), we had a marathon first date that started with Quaker meeting, then skiing, then lunch, then a dance performance of Pilobolus, and then dinner! During that Sunday, we discovered an incredible amount of things in common. Music was important with a number of \"our songs\" supplied by Tina Turner, Anne Doyle, Beth Nielsen Chapman, and others, and incredible bouts of laughter. BZ: Craig, tell us about your family background. Where were you raised? How big a family? What was your religious upbringing during childhood?The Crazy Wisdom Community Journal January - April 2011 Page 51 Gay and Lesbian Spiritual and Family Life in Ann Arbor \"...God in the broadest sense of the word embraces me, and loves AT and me as a couple. I would say I am a seeker of truth and I am open. God will not disappoint me.\" --Craig Kukuk An Interview with Gay Couple AT Miller and Craig Kukuk on the Evolution of their Spiritually Rich Life TogetherAT Miller and Craig Kukuk Continued on page 52BZ: AT, you were exposed to both Lutheran and Quaker influences and practices....and you also mentioned to me Episcopalian roots. Please talk about those influences and roots. AT: My childhood church was a liberal Lutheran church with lots of intellectual and advanced theology, which made its way into the school we attended, connected to that church. With Quaker cousins and grandparents, I often raised questions in our Lutheran school religious lessons, so I was somewhat of a bother to the teachers. My great grandfather was an Episcopal priest, and his father an Episcopal bishop, along with a close set of cousins. While there was a certain austerity to the Quaker background, the vast majority of my family on both sides are jokers, so lots of teasing and silliness were mixed into a rather religious family. Nearly all of my relatives attended religious services regularly (every week) when we were growing up, and we had nightly devotions in our home at various times, and prayers at every meal and at night. BZ: At what age did you come out, and were your parents accepting of you, at that time? AT Miller: I was out to myself as long as I can remember, and knew at a very early age. I had a boyfriend in high school, but it was a time period when people did not really \"notice\" so much and we were not out to make a point publicly . So, I was out to other gay people in high school and college, and that spread to savvy allies/friends. I did not speak directly to my parents about it until my 30s, and my mom blurted out (to my shock), \"Oh, I LOVE gay men!\" I had thought they would be supportive, but this was a little extreme. Turns out her brother, my uncle, though married, was gay, several of her colleagues, etc. My dad was not as enthusiastic initially, but she brought him around. BZ: Your family was deeply involved with the Swedish Coventry Church in western Michigan. Please talk about your upbringing in that church, and how that church has welcomed gay and lesbians, or not. AT: Harbert Community Church. Our family never attended this church as a family , only my parents did in their retirement. It is a low-key and informal church\u2014the only one in Harbert, and Craig and I regularly sang there as soloists when we visited. Suddenly, the denomination declared, sometime around 2003, that Gay people could not be members, and it was very divisive. Several prominent members left the church in protest at the bigotry, including an elderly deacon, who wrote a very beautiful and eloquent letter that she shared with Craig and me, even though she did not know us well, (but was a friend of my parents). My mom tried to stay and fight in the church for several years, seeking a real explanation. She had been president or chair of the congregation and director of education, etc, and it was very painful for her , since the church was so obviously wrong in her eyes.Craig Kukuk: I grew up in a middle class, white-flight neighborhood in Lutheran, East Detroit. My Dad had been a Marine sergeant, then worked for Detroit Edison. Two sisters and a 50s-style stay-at-home mom. Dad had trouble with alcohol and we had our difficulties. My older sisters left immediately after high school. I think a lot of this caused me to go inward and seek God. My grandmother was a great support and took interest in me, bringing me on outings to Greenfield Village and having me stay over. AT, what about your family background, and where were you raised, and your religious background? AT Miller: My mom's family is all Lutheran, Dad's is Quaker\u2014we attended Lutheran primary school (I have six brothers and sisters) and mainly lived in Oak Park, Illinois, an old established and prosperous suburban Chicago community . We spent a great deal of time on Lake Michigan in Lakeside and Harbert, Michigan, where much of my dad's family has had summer homes for generations. My mother's family has had a similar set up on Pewaukee Lake in Wisconsin, so we grew up with many cousins in a very musical family, with lots of sports (golf, tennis, gymnastics, sailing, swimming\u2014and less formal games almost every night) and performances (school, church, and family events). Because of this attachment to place and to many relatives, surrounded by heirlooms, books, and achievements, we had a very strong sense of family history and influence. The immediate family membership was Lutheran during my youth, but I was influenced by the Quaker part of my family, and I started attending the Quaker meeting more in high school. BZ: Craig, I know you spent some years involved with a Christian community called Jesus People USA. Please tell us about that. Craig Kukuk: Ex-gay ministries are an outreach of the church trying to offer support and \"change\" through Jesus Christ, and they believe God does not create Gay people. I struggled with \"sexually acting out\" and then being tormented with guilt. I moved to the JPUSA Commune in 1985, desperate to change, and I would do anything it took. BZ: So, you spent a long time involved in a Christian way of life which was anti- gay. Please share some of your reflections on that, as you look back, and how those years continue to reverberate in your life now. And also tell us what you remember fondly from those years, and what the \"gifts\" of that strong belief system were, for you? Craig Kukuk: I had a simple clear belief in God as my Father\u2014part of the charismatic renewal in the 70's. While others had their drugs, I had the Holy Spirit. Quite simply, I loved Jesus, not really the church. I wanted to be like Jesus and be a light unto the world. BZ: Craig, how do those years of living and working in an anti-gay r eligious environment impact your spiritual life now, if at all, or impact your point of view? Craig Kukuk: I still have an inner deep love for Jesus, but now I don't have all the answers. God is so much bigger than a book or a church. It doesn' t really matter to me what others think\u2014I know my heart. I continue to seek God, but it' s not limited by Christianity\u2014it's broader. I have to admit that there is a rather deep sadness in me, and some anger towards the church. But I think Jesus would feel the same way . BZ: You mentioned to me that many of the people working in those Christian organizations were deeply sincere in their beliefs. How have you come to understand their faith and their spiritual lives and good works? Craig Kukuk: Their sincerity goes without question. Without a doubt they loved me and that's why they got into that work. Their belief system is completely around the Bible and their interpretation of it. They wanted to help me. But, the bottom line is, I am who I am, and I've come to peace with that. I do not see the Bible as the supreme authority any longer. That's the breaking point with them.\"I still have an inner deep love for Jesus, but now I don't have all the answers. God is so much bigger than a book or a church. It doesn't really matter to me what others think\u2014I know my heart.\" --Craig KukukThe Crazy Wisdom Community Journal January - April 2011 Page 52 ...\"Suddenly, the denomination declared, sometime around 2003, that Gay people could not be members, and it was very divisive.

And how has their experience with their church in Harbert influenced their current outlook, and their current church involvement? AT: They pre-screened possible church affiliations in Ann Arbor for being gay- welcoming and gay-affirming after their struggle in Harbert, actually interviewing the Pastors about it. BZ: When in your life did you get involved with the Quakers in Ann Arbor? And are both you and Craig now members of the Quaker meeting? AT: I moved to Ann Arbor in August of 2000 and immediately attended meeting, and I regularly serve on committees there. In fact, I think I attended meeting during one of the weekends of my job interviews with the university. I'm still officially a member of a Quaker meeting in Philadelphia for historical and family reasons. Craig is not an official member, and has no interest in being a member of any religious organization. BZ: In what ways do you feel that your being a gay couple sets you apart in your Quaker community. Do you feel wholeheartedly a part of the Quaker community? AT Miller: It does not set us apart since there are a number of other gay couples. We attended a couples forum at the meeting several years ago that was very rich, and there were four hetero couples, a lesbian couple, and us. It is nice to be included as one of the diverse people. Craig says, \"I don't want to be set apart\u2014I just want to hold my partner's hand when we are in a place of worship. AT is my husband, not my friend.\" The Quakers honor that. Craig Kukuk: AT holds some high national responsibilities in Quaker organizations and is completely out and accepted. AT Miller: People ask about Craig as my husband. The Ann Arbor meeting at one point got worried at our wedding because they had forgotten to pick up the marriage license\u2014we had to remind them that in Michigan there was no such thing. BZ: More generally, please talk about your own spiritual beliefs, as gay men, yes, but even more so as human beings trying to find meaning and purpose in this life. Craig Kukuk: I do not want to come off as having figured out God or having any great knowledge. But I know in my heart of hearts that God in the broadest sense of the word embraces me, and loves AT and me as a couple. I would say I am a seeker of truth and I am open. God will not disappoint me. AT Miller: As someone who helped organize the Washtenaw Faith Action Network, I work hard to have all people see that God is really love-- for them, no matter how bigoted or mistaken some elements of religious groups may be. I avoid \"Craig says, 'I don't want to be set apart\u2014I just want to hold my partner's hand when we are in a place of worship. AT is my husband, not my friend.' The Quakers honor that.\" --A T MillerBZ: Craig, I know you spent some years involved with a Christian community called Jesus People USA. Please tell us about that.

God is in and with all. BZ: What would you like to add, about your experiences as gay men in our culture, and as a gay couple in our culture, in terms of your spiritual lives and evolution? AT, you first. Then Craig. AT Miller: I have had a powerful and positive spiritual life all of my life, and have had many occasions in the kind of work I do to mentor others on essential life questions. This is a very helpful blessing in a culture where, on a daily basis, people feel free to openly condemn, denounce, and degrade. I use my poetry , music, and teaching as testimony. The Quakers say, \"Let your life speak\". Craig: I am deeply saddened by the divide between homosexuality and the church. It is sad to hear Gay people mock God. And it's sad when some in the church don't do their homework. What is said from the pulpit or read in books is often what people assume to be the truth, when, in many cases, there are centuries of misinterpretations of a book that has been altered and manipulated, and there are now traditions and doctrines to back up what is still being perpetuated as the Truth. I think the churches, seminaries and divinity programs need to know what is truth and what is tradition. People are often misled and then are surprised when they discover what the real story is. I believe people would rather seek what's comfortable for them rather than truly seek God's truth. That works for the person who fits well into that tradition or belief system. But for those who do not, it can be a life of hell and condemnation. I know about the issue of homosexuality because I live it and I know my heart and I have done years of my homework, in order to not give up or lose what' s most precious to me--my faith. This may raise eyebrows or it may close doors in my face and that is what hurts the most. I have found that most churches don't really want my story, my testimony. They would rather have me tell a testa-phony in order to perpetuate what they believe. Usually they want to have their own agenda and want to change you instead of taking the time to truly listen to what my experience has shown me--to how God has actually worked in my life. In closing, let me say that it is the responsibility of every human being to do their homework (cler gy and others) in order to seek out what the real truth is. ### (AT Miller and Craig Kukuk can be reached at: atmiller80@gmail.com.)\"So, I was out to other gay people in high school and college, and that spread to savvy allies/friends. I did not speak directly to my parents about it until my 30s, and my mom blurted out (to my shock), 'Oh, I LOVE gay men!' I had thought they would be supportive, but this was a little extreme.\" --A T Miller The Crazy Wisdom Community Journal January - April 2011 Page 54 Book Reviews ~ January to April 2011 The book reviews below are for the books selected for our monthly book discussion groups at Crazy W isdom. The reviews were written by the Crazy Wisdom staff people who will be hosting the individual book conversations. Our book discussion groups are the second Fridays of each month, at 7 pm. They're free, and open to anyone. Friday, January 14th Ecological Intelligence: The Hidden Impacts of What We Buy by Daniel Goleman The title of Daniel Goleman' s compelling new book is a little misleading. When I first picked up Ecological Intelligence: The Hidden Impacts of What We Buy, I thought I would become further informed of the negative environmental impacts of the products I buy to make better purchasing choices. Goleman does address this topic, but in a broad sense designed to show the reader that even the most eco-minded actions carry unintentional consequences that negatively impact the environment, our health, and society. Of course, this is a disheartening point, but it is made to support a paradigm shift that is occurring in the world of manufacturing: radical transparency. Radical transparency will make the environmental, health and social impacts of every step of the making of a product transparent, giving buyers the power to choose products that most fit their values. And this, according to Goleman, will be the motivating factor for businesses to make more environmentally and socially responsible products. A hopeful snapshot of the potential power of our choices, but the question remains: will these changes be enough? --Rachel Pastiva, Bookstore Manager at Crazy Wisdom _______________ Friday, February 11th The Cow in the Parking Lot --- A Zen Approach to Overcoming Anger by Leonard Scheff and Susan Edmiston. This is an intelligent and mostly interesting book on the Buddhist view of anger . The authors have synthesized the writings of Robert Thurman, Pema Chodron, Jack Kornfield, John Tarrant,Thich Nhat Hanh and others, and written what is, in most respects, a Buddhist/American self-help book. It has chapters on Pride, Honor and Other Buttons -- Our Sore Spots ; Unshakeable Calm -- Dealing with the Anger of Others; To Be or Not to Be Angry -- You Have a Choice; and What Happens When We Give Up Anger. Many of you already know this stuff, but putting it into practice is another story. Living with anger, in ourselves and others, always provides food for thought and material for personal growth, so this book will be an excellent conversation-starter at the Crazy Wisdom Book Discussion Group on February 11th. I like the book's exercises, which are interspersed throughout. They give the book an immediacy that makes it worthwhile. W e live in a world of our own illusions and projections and wayward thoughts. This book nicely reminds the reader of the daily need to be awake, and how one might make small strides in that direction. If you're interested in the topic, it's really fine to come to the book discussion even if you haven't read the book! -- Bill Zirinsky , co-owner of Crazy Wisdom _______________ Friday, March 11th Bring Me the Rhinoceros and Other Zen Koans that Will Save Your Life by John Tarrant John Tarrant, Roshi, a psychologist and director of the Pacific Zen Institute, says right away, \"Usually taken as some sort of riddle or odd question, a koan actually has its origins in sayings or records of conversations between people interested in the secret of life.\" People would come to teachers and \"instead of giving kind advice, or step-by-step instructions, the teachers responded to the students as if they were capable of coming to a complete understanding in that moment.\" For instance, the rhinoceros koan of the book's title: A traveler had given the governor a fan made of rhinoceros horn, and under the Zen rule that expensive, useless objects flow to those who don't care about them, the governor gave the fan to Y anguan (a teacher). Everyone forgot about it, until one summer day , Yanguan asked, \"Bring me the rhinoceros fan.\" case,\" replied Yanguan, \"Bring me the assistant was struck dumb. Tarrant writes, \"When Yanguan asked for the rhinoceros, it was a world-stopping question for the assistant. The glue that connected one thought to another, and that pair of thoughts to another pair, and so on - the glue that made his reality - had failed.\" The book chooses fifteen koans that vary widely and are presented with care. John Tarrant sprinkles in opinions and stories from his own life, entertaining and provocative. He begins the introduction, \"This book offers an unusual path to happiness ....by subverting unhappiness.\" It worked for me. I suggest you read at least the introduction and first chapter, about 20 pages. -- Jonathan Ellis, Honorary Crazy Wisdom Sage _______________ Friday, April 8th Daughters of the Witching Hill by Mary Sharratt In August of 1612 in Lancaster England, twelve Pendle Forest individuals (ten women and two men) were arrested for the crimes of witchcraft and murder. One woman was found guilty of witchcraft, but not murder, and received a sentence of imprisonment. Of the remaining, ten were found guilty of witchcraft and murder and executed by hanging. But what of the twelfth? Elizabeth Southerns, alias Demdike, blind and in her eighties, died in prison before being brought to trial. Nevertheless, she was considered to be a witch on the basis of evidence already given, evidence and testimony presented by her grandchildren. The Daughters of the Witching Hill is Elizabeth's story. Mary Sharratt is an amazing storyteller whose retelling of the story of the Pendle Witches and their lives will stir emotions and deep inner feelings for the fate of these women and their families. The story is told in the first person by Elizabeth Southerns, known as Demdike, a blesser and charmer in Pendle Forest. I was deeply moved by Elizabeth' s account of life in 1600s England. Although I knew this period in time to be dark, I felt heartsick reading their accounts of famine, strife, class separation and constant religious changes enforced by the monarchy which made for more misery in their lives. Life seemed sorrowful, lacking the smallest joys. But these women of Pendle Forest would not be held in darkness, they fought with amazing will, strength and conviction to keep themselves and their families together , fed and safe in dangerous times. These women were true heroines. I consider this book to be a \"must read\". -- Carol Karr, Senior Manager, Crazy Wisdom Children's Book and Media Reviews By Sarah Newland, mother of two (ages four and twelve) and devoted parent of Waldorf education Mommy, Mama, and Me By Katie Leslea Newman, Illustrated by Carol ThompsonThis simple board book happily explores life with two moms for the young child with bright illustrations.

Written as a diary of a girl in 1933 with her correspondence to her beloved aunt, this volume is elaborately illustrated with paintings, collage, photography , script, and found objects. Also includes an amazing pop-up at the back of the book with sound effects. Both of my children loved this book, as it speaks to many ages in different ways.

Rachel Pastiva: Can you summarize the storyline of Aprilmae Gets Carried Away? Diane Friese: Aprilmae is a story about a creative spirit and how a creative spirit can sometimes take us over the top! Most importantly , Aprilmae Gets Carried Away! is the story of a community coming together and celebrating their differences and their individuality. Susan Russell: The storyline follows a well-intentioned Aprilmae on her annual painting mission to fill Fairie Fae with beautiful spring colors. She then attempts to take her talents to the human world, but learned they don' t appreciate all of her colorful endeavors. Aprilmae seeks advice from her fellow fairies and Mother Alannah, the Wise Earth Mother. She learns why her artistry was not welcome, and what she must do to repair the harm she had inadvertently caused. RP: I love the main character's name \"Miss Aprilmae June\". As there are three of you responsible for creating the book, can you speak a little on the process of writing it together?Diane Friese: Eating and laughing was an integral part of the process. Susan Russell: Each one of us contributed in unique ways. The story concept was Diane's, and she asked me to co-write this book with her, knowing I am a word nut. She and I pretty much wrote the story word-by-word. Diane offered her fabulous illustrations, and I was the primary editor. Then we asked Daniele to join us. As a talented graphic designer, she provided the final steps in formatting and preparing the manuscript for publication. The process was fascinating, challenging and rewarding. It was amazing how well our varied abilities meshed together. Not a small factor in the process was all the laughter, singing, and silliness that went into it. Oh, yes, and lots and lots of food. RP: On your website, screendoorpublishing.com, it says you are looking forward to writing a follow up book. Is a new book already underway, and do you imagine there will be even more in the series? Will the next book also focus on Aprilmae, or will there be a new character introduced? Diane Friese: A new fairy book is underway. The story takes place in the western part of our magical land where the fairies help to protect the environment and remind humans that they are a part of an awe inspiring natural world. Aprilmae's friend, July, will make a return appearance. RP: It's no secret that fairies are a very big deal in Ann Arbor. Can you speak on why these magical beings are such good role models for our children? Diane Friese: Fairies have taken many forms in many cultures. We hope our wee fairies tip-toe their way into the hearts and imaginations of children and help them begin to be exposed to some important issues. Susan Russell: This is a very thought-provoking question! Fairies touch and engage the child's imagination. They are tiny replicas of humans, (except for the wings, of course), and children love miniature playthings. Lastly , they have magical powers as we all wish we had. As a little girl, I was fascinated by Peter Pan's Tinkerbell. I was certain she had sprinkled me with fairy dust, and I would be able to fly! RP: How did the idea of Screen Door Publishing come about? What is the meaning behind its name? Diane Friese: My sister-in-law keeps an old green door in her garden. My mother repeatedly encouraged me to write a story about a magic kingdom existing on the other side. After doing a little research on the name \"green door\" I found that it was the name of a song from the 50's which referred to activities inappropriate for children! Still, we liked the idea for Screen Door Publishing and the introduction for our first book, Aprilmae Gets Carried Away! Susan Russell: The title of our company, Screen Door Publishing, came from the introduction of Aprilmae Gets Carried Away, in which the \"screen door\" leads to Fairie Fae, the magical land of fairies. Diane, who conceptualized and illustrated the story, suggested the name and the logo for our company, and Danni and I loved it!A New Fairy Comes to Town ~ A Talk with the Creators of the Locally Published Fairy Book, Aprilmae Gets Carried Away!

Daniele O'Brien: I've known Susan Russell since college. We lived in the same dorm, Goodison, at Eastern Michigan University. We lived together all through our early college years. I met Diane through Susan several years ago. Last summer Suzy, Diane, and I went up north for a long weekend. That was the first time I spent much time with Diane. We spent our ladies weekend singing, shopping, touring, and spitting cherry pits, and a bond was formed! Diane Friese: Susan I have been friends for about 15 years. We met when our sons were running track and cross country at Saline High School. Susan introduced me to her long time friend, Danni, while we were on a women's weekend trip to Glen Arbor. Together we shared a great weekend of singing, dancing and general silliness. We have been fast friends ever since. Susan Russell: Danni and I have known each other since we met in the dorm at Eastern Michigan University. Our friendship developed over dorm water fights, roller-skating derbies, and singing Motown and show tunes. As Diane said, she and I were devoted parents sitting on the bleachers, cheering on our sons in the cold and the rain. There was lots of rain! RP: What do you (or did you) do for a living? Daniele O'Brien: I'm a graphic designer. Diane Friese: I am a retired educator. My area of interest and, really, my heart lies with nurturing our little ones in the school environment. I am a huge proponent of public education and readying our newest little citizens for a better world. Susan Russell: For 33 years, I taught students with significant special needs, as an employee of the Washtenaw Intermediate School District in Ann Arbor. I loved working with these young people, helping them become as independent and responsible as possible. RP: How has collaborating with friends on a children's book transformed your life? Daniele O'Brien: It's been wonderful having these two women in my life. The three of us have common interests and passions. I think we bring out the best in each other, especially creativity with lots of laughter. Diane Friese: Working with friends has taught me lessons in patience, sharing, and appreciation of individual styles. Mostly it has brought a great amount of love and laughter.Susan Russell: When I retired, I had no idea that my life would go in this direction. For me retirement was not just an ending but a beginning. I knew that I was a bit of a wordsmith, but did not envision that would lead me anywhere. I give credit and thanks to Diane, who recognized this and asked me to co-write the book with her. My longtime friend, Danni, fit perfectly into this process with her graphic designing skills. As a result, phenomenal experiences and people have become part of my life. I learned to be true to myself, and be open to the possibilities that life offers. RP: What are some of your hobbies? Daniele O'Brien: I garden, draw, collect glass to make garden totems, paint recycled tile trivets, make jewelry, read, and love walking. My current passion is creating Zentangles. I always have my sketch book with me and talk about Zentangles to anyone who will listen! Diane Friese: Since retiring, I am very fortunate to be living my hobby! Susan Russell: I love being with my family, gardening and nature, reading, walking, crafting, crossword puzzles, and the arts. Not to mention hanging out with the terrific friends who are in my life. Oh, yes, and writing!! ### (Visit www.screendoorpublishing.com for upcoming events and future releases or email the creators individually: Daniele O'Brien: dobriendesign@comcast.net; Diane Friese: dianefriese47@yahoo.com; Susan Russell: rsooz68@yahoo.com)\"They have magical powers as we all wish we had.

What have you seen or felt that you can't quite explain? This magical land of enchanted beings is what Jennifer Styblo and I wish to convey to children of all ages in our workshops, \"Magical Mornings with the Angels and Faeries.\" The idea of faeries captivated Jennifer ever since she was a little girl. She says, \"I found the meadow near my house to be a magical place where the Queen Anne's lace waltzed in the breeze, the rabbits played, and, I was sure, the faeries were dancing. We played there often, and I always felt a playful and loving presence. In Girl Scouts, I sat with rapt attention to the stories of the brownies\u2014 the elves who help their chosen families by performing services at night \u2014 and wished that I could see them. In the backyard pond, mysterious bubbles moved to the surface, and I thought of the water sprites that could be sending signals to each other .\" She continues, \"Faeries are an example of the magic in nature that surrounds us every day that we, as a society, do not take the time to recognize and appreciate. What better time to discover the faerie world than as an innocent child, whose beliefs have not yet been limited by the society we live in? It is important to learn to connect with the earth, to honor her and steward her, while we are still young.\" Jennifer's nine-year-old twins, Kimberly and Christina, like to leave offerings of sweetened milk and honey cereal for the faeries under their hydrangea bush. They also feed the birds and collect acorns for the squirrels, to let the fae folk know that they love and respect the earth and the animals. They would love to meet mermaids, brownies, water sprites, and the faeries that care for the flowers and animals. I, too, know and believe in the faerie kingdom, along with all elementals and angels. I reaffirm this each day as I walk through the fields and woods around my home. Slowly an awareness comes upon me, a feeling that I am being watched, secretly. I sense a feeling of shyness by whoever is watching. With each step I take, this awareness builds until a burst of joyful energy washes over me. I have just entered the realm of the field faeries who live near me! I delight in the exchange of love, joy, and happy energy, along with sensing that I am being invited to play. Keeping this belief alive for children of all ages is important. So often, this connection to fae folk and angels is lost as children mature, because most adults think that these nature spirits are make-believe. When my granddaughter arrived twelve years ago, I made a conscious choice to introduce her to the nature spirits. From the time she was a few months old, we would take walks through the fields and woods, touching plant life to feel their energy . Even at an early age, she expressed that the trees \"tickled\" her when she hugged them. She would talk about the \"shining lights\" she saw when we called out to the faeries. The \"Magical Mornings with the Angels and Faeries\" workshops were designed for children ages four and older. The workshop begins with a story about faeries or angels, and culminates with a colorful, nature-based craft related to the story. At a recent workshop, we made faerie tambourines out of grapevines and decorated them with flowers, ribbons, and bells. Jennifer and I delight in helping children discover the playful, loving, joyful, energy that the faeries and angels share with us. We invite parents and their young children to explore the enchanting world of faeries and angels with us through stories and artistic endeavors. \" Magical Mornings with the Angels and Faeries\" allows us to share our love for children while encouraging their creative talents to come forth. ### (To see a video with beautiful illustrations of the faeries and their world, go to: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-KNS-v2iuAA For more information on \"Magical Mornings with the Angels and Faeries,\" call (419) 283-4344 or send an email from the \"contact\" page at www.thecosmicgoddess.com.) They would love to meet mermaids, brownies, water sprites, and the faeries that care for the flowers and animals. I, too, know and believe in the faerie kingdom, along with all elementals and angels. I reaffirm this each day as I walk through the fields and woods around my home.Teaching children about Na ture through F aeries and Na ture SpiritsThe Crazy Wisdom Community Journal January - April 2011 Page 59 By Annie Zirkel Safe, secure attachment is an essential ingredient to raising emotionally healthy children. How we connect, how we disconnect, and how we reconnect with our children provides a framework for developing their abilities to form strong, healthy relationships now and later on in life. There are many reasons caregivers may struggle with attachment to their children: Having had poor models themselves or a childhood history of neglect or abuse, dealing with postpartum depression or other mental health issues, or extremely challenging stressors such as financial worries, lack of support, or even sleep deprivation. For all these reasons, a parent's ability to attach to their children may be inconsistent or even questionable. And, of course, we can't forget each child's temperamental and special needs for attachment, which add to the complexity of getting it right. The encouraging news is that, despite all these challenges, most parents have enough emotional health and personal support to give their children the reasonably consistent, healthy attachment they need. And even for those who don't, having an understanding of what to strive for can be a good start. What good attachment requires is the ability to find the relationship' s rhythm and move with the beat. It means being conscious enough and open enough to allow your child to set the tone, when possible, and being kind enough when it is you who needs to take the lead. It starts with noticing and honoring both when your child wants to engage and when they want to back away. Paying attention to eye contact, proximity, and the child's level of interest can all give clues to how the connection feels. Especially valuable in gauging that moment's bond is noticing the child's emotional and anxiety limits \u2014 whether they are expressed through shutting down or by becoming irritable. Comments like \"Watch me, Mom!\" and \"Dad, can you help me with this homework?\" or just sitting near you on the couch are requests for attachment. Squirming to get away, averting their eyes, or ignoring you are signals that they would prefer to detach at the moment. Detachment and reattachment can also be tricky. In fact, separation anxiety is about a child working through detachment issues. Later on, that same child might run to the other kids at preschool without looking back, ready to join her peers. And, of course, parents need to pay attention to their own attachment issues. Whether they manifest as needing a break or as an urge to run after that preschooler and hold them tight, it's important to be aware of when it's really your issue. For each parent/child pair, there will be ages and stages that make connection easier or less so. Some parents do well with babies, but struggle with power -seeking two- year-olds. Others hit their stride when kids are in elementary school but lose the beat when they hit puberty. Still others find that attachment flows better in the teen years, when adolescents are able to use reason (occasionally!), or when their kids move out and there is more space between them. Other challenges include who picks the tune \u2014 school, hygiene, diet, behavior , chores? And who chooses the tempo. Is it upbeat? Double-time? Melancholy? Pleasant? Impatient? Given these aspects, it's easier to understand why we (or our partner) might want to sit this one out. For myself, I lost the rhythm with my youngest son when he was dealing with some learning challenges in late elementary and early middle school. How many times had I not noticed that his angry outbursts or his attempts to hide behind his arm or his hair as we worked on a task were his way of telling me that he needed a break? So intent on making one last point, so focused on my goals, I missed these cues.Things are better now. In fact, contrary to the complaints of some parents, texting has been a less intense way for my children and I to connect: Son: I'm downtown. B home by dinner.Me: OK \u2014 how was school?Son: Oh yeah, I got a 60 on my math test. Hmmm...You can see why connecting through text might be a bit easier! And while we do need to talk about that grade, at this point I'm just glad my sons are still reaching out. Honoring our children's attachment needs while teaching them how to be the kind of person that others want to attach to, and helping them push through momentary anxiety so that they can deal with imperfect attachment, are the goals \u2014 and a balancing act. The key is to find the beat, try not to step on each other's toes, and allow each partner to take the lead sometimes. The good news is that when children experience good attachment, even if imperfect or given a late start, they have something to pass on to those with whom they connect with. Which gives hope not only for the future of attachment, but also for overcoming a challenging past and, possibly most importantly, for the \"now\" of every parent-child connection out there. ### (Annie Zirkel, LPC, is a local Parenting & Relationship Consultant and author of You'll Thank Me Later ~ A Guide To Raising Grateful Children (& Why That Matters).

A life coach and doula, Cynthia has attended nearly 100 births. Cynthia's favorite moments ar e when she taps into greater strength than she is aware of possessing. She has found pregnancy, childbirth, art and creative writing to be powerful mediums for women to get in touch with their dreams and wisdom. She is the mother of three and lives in Ann Arbor.) Rachel Pastiva: You recently wrote a book Natural Hospital Birth: The Best of Both Worlds, due out in March through Harvard Common Press. Can you speak a little on the premise of the book, and why you were inspired to write about this particular aspect of childbearing? Cynthia Gabriel: I have interviewed more than 300 women about their birth experiences. Too often women tell their birth stories through tears. While I love to see those women go on to have empowered and more informed second births, I think it is tragic that we have an epidemic of women who desire natural birth in hospitals who can't seem to achieve this meaningful goal.As a doula for women who desire natural births in hospitals, I slowly realized that what made me successful was not my knowledge of breathing techniques or massage, but my ability to team- build with hospital staff. When I helped women and their partners communicate how significant natural birth was to them, I saw that staf f members were more likely to support their goal. Unfortunately, most books and classes do not explain much about team building in the hospital. Without a unified team, women can expect to either be at war with the staff (which doesn't feel good for anyone) or they can expect to receive \"regular\" birth care, which these days includes dozens of medical interventions, and for a third of women even means a cesarean section. RP: What are some aspects of the birth experience that are lost during average American hospital births and why should women want to preserve them? Cynthia Gabriel: I think that most women hope and believe that birth can be sacred. All those reality shows about birth on TV are capitalizing on how beautiful and moving birth is. The reason that I care about preserving natural birth in hospitals is because the experience of giving birth to our babies with our own power is exhilarating, life-changing, and empowering. When we give birth naturally, the hour after our babies are born we are flooded with the most intense hormones we will probably ever experience in life. We don't get this experience when we are drugged up and our babies are pulled out of us. Women who give birth naturally describe a long-lasting effect that positively changes their perceptions of themselves. They say that they are amazed at their own depths. They are stronger than they had ever imagined. They believe they can do anything. They are excited about facing new challenges in life because they are more aware of their full capacities. Not only are they set up to be confident, happy mothers, but also to be more confident in their careers and other relationships, too. RP: Why are some women fearful of home births, and how does having a natural hospital birth help assuage fears? Cynthia Gabriel: I devote a whole chapter in my book to \"Feeling Safe.\" Birth setting, to me, is a secondary concern. Feeling safe is a laboring mother 's first concern. Fear is a normal part of birth. So is overcoming that fear and feeling stronger on the other side. Unfortunately, in the United States, we do not have many cultural messages that reinforce the positive benefits of facing our fears.Many women feel safest giving birth in a hospital. They want the feeling of \"safety\" that all that technology gives them. Other women feel unsafe in hospitals. I believe that women should give birth wherever they feel safest: at home, in the woods, or in a hospital. I do not say this because I believe that most women need immediate access to hospital technology. Actually, they do not. But women need to give birth where they feel safest so that labor can progress well. When a woman (or any mammal) feels unsafe, she releases hormones like adrenaline that can play havoc with labor .

Cynthia Gabriel: This is the most important question that an expectant mother who desires a natural hospital birth can ask. Even when we are not in labor , it is often hard to stand up for what we truly want in life in the face of opposition. The single most effective technique I have seen work in hospitals is to reiterate, over and over again, how meaningful natural birth is for you. You will never win if you try to argue with medical professionals about how unnecessary most episiotomies or c-sections are. You just create more adversity when you argue. But if you stick to what you know, that natural birth is important to you, than the instinctive human ur ge of most doctors, nurses, and hospital midwives is to support you. There are certainly some who stubbornly believe that you are wrong to care about your birth experience, but I have seen many hospital personnel come around because the commitment of a woman is so inspiring. RP: In your research, have you found that doctors are receptive and encouraging to expectant mothers who want to take a more active role in the birth experience? What would your advice be to women who face resistance from doctors? Cynthia Gabriel: Some doctors really love attending active, natural births and some think natural birth is just crazy. And there are a lot of doctors who have not seen many natural births, even in years of practice, because there are generally so few to see (only about two percent of hospital births can truly be considered \"natural.\") Most midwives and doctors work in shifts, so you don't know who will be on call when you go into labor. For this reason, you won't know ahead of time whether your hospital staff will support or resist your plans. So I advise women to bring an experienced doula with them. The laboring mother needs to focus on her body, her contractions, and the baby. If she has a partner, her partner also needs to focus on the labor. But a doula can be a big help in creating the birth experience the woman and her partner are hoping for, even in the face of resistance. RP: What advice would you give to an expectant mother who is struggling to determine what her best option is? Cynthia Gabriel: Look into your heart. No one else will give birth to your baby. Only you will. So you must be at peace with your decisions. If you are not at peace, your body will not produce the right hormones and the whole delicate balance of birth can be upset. Many people will have opinions about what you should do - and they will continue to have those opinions all through the years that you parent this child, too. But for once in your life you can feel fine about basing your decisions on what feels right and true for you. If this is unclear to you, you may need more information or you may simply need a friend who is willing to put aside her own opinions to help you uncover what is in your own heart. RP: What can people hope to learn who attend your event at Crazy Wisdom?Cynthia Gabriel: I am on a mission to empower birthing women and their families to be able to give birth naturally wherever they choose to give birth. In hospitals, we need to advocate strongly for ourselves. Most women, even many women who say they want natural birth, end up with epidurals, drugs to stimulate labor , episiotomies, cesarean sections, and other interventions. Some simple \"tricks\" make a world of difference in the hospital. I am happy to share them with anyone I meet. ### (Cynthia Gabriel can be reached at 734-883-8701 or at cynthia@togrow.org.Her website is at: http://www.togrow.org/index.html.)\"I devote a whole chapter in my book to \"Feeling Safe.\" Birth setting, to me, is a secondary concern.

Adventures in Dreamland: The Wild Ride! by local author Lisa Pollock, tells the lively story of a young boy and his friend, White Kitty, as they encounter exciting adventures on the other side of sleep. Pollock wrote the book from the many stories she told her son, Cameron, as part of his bedtime ritual. White Kitty was a favorite toy for Cameron in early childhood. Dreamland is boldly illustrated, with bright, cartoon-like drawings. Illustrator Mike Ferrin's work punctuates the action-packed style of the text and the ever-changing scenarios in which the main characters find themselves. Pollock captures that somewhat New, Fun, and Just Plain Cool chaotic state that dreams often create, sending the boy and White Kitty on a roller-coaster ride of adventure. Pollock has always enjoyed writing creatively. She notes, \"I love to delve into the world of imaginary characters to create my own entertaining tales. Many of my stories are inspired by family.\" Adventures in Dreamland is part of a continuing series of books based on real life, centering on the adventures of her son. Coming soon is A Special Moment With Grandma. Pollock, an Ann Arbor native and, for the last six years, a Pinckney resident, says, \"It is the little things in life, the cherished moments and daydreams, which help us get through stressful or difficult times. All of it creates an opportunity for inspirational, true-life stories.\" Adventures in Dreamland: The Wild Ride! is available at Crazy Wisdom, and from Polly's Paper Studio in Pinckney and The Candy Trail in Plymouth, as well as online at www.zoelifepub.com and www.amazon.com.

Wilson, who practices from her home, works telepathically with children, engaging \"with the higher self and the unconscious self to resolve the root causes of problems. People see results right away.\" Wilson states that she works with children while \"they are in school or doing other things. I have the parent on the phone.\" She adds that this approach does not involve an office visit for the child. Wilson works with children who have early trauma or hereditary weakness, social or personal challenges, and family conflict or abuse, among other things.

Hoping to quash what sometimes seems like an epidemic of rudeness, anger, and insensitivity that has developed in our society , Lexi's Upstairs manager Jan Engholm has developed a series of manners classes for children, providing etiquette training for ages 3 to 8. Engholm believes that \"even very young children can learn fundamental social skills, giving them confidence to manage almost any social situation.\" The classes, held on the second floor of Lexi's Toy Box at 328 S. Ashley Street in downtown Ann Arbor (see story below), explore etiquette in easy-going and fun-filled ways. Engholm uses storytelling, role-playing, and crafts, among other things, to teach whom she calls \"future ambassadors for a kinder, gentler world.\" Kindness, courtesy toward others, and respect toward people and animals are skills that can be acquired. As she notes, \"Children with basic good manners are not only nicer to be around, but more likely to succeed in life.\" A longtime docent at the University of Michigan Museum of Art, Engholm, who is also a K-8 substitute teacher in Ann Arbor, strongly feels that social skills will help give children confidence to manage almost any social situation. She has seen this in her work life and in her personal life as a parent. Life is just easier, notes Engholm, if one has these skills as a second-nature response to everyday happenings.

A wonderful toy store has at least three key ingredients: oodles of bright color, a sense of style and lively energy, and most of all, that ineffable, unmistakable quality of magical playthings. Lexi's Toy Box in Ann Arbor is just such a wonderful toy experience. Owned and operated by Crystal Metzger, a charming, lively woman, the little shop at 328 S. Ashley is filled with delightful European and hand-crafted toys similar to those that Metzger enjoyed as a child. The business opened in October of 2007 in a wood-frame house that had once belonged to Metzger's grandfather and grandmother. Built in the 1860's, her aunt and uncle lived there during the 1950s. Later, the home was used as offices by members of the Metzger family, who were involved in the restaurant business in Ann Arbor. The house embodies a wealth of family history, and was awaiting a new direction when Lexi's came about. Metzger's experiences and knowledge guide her choices of items for sale in her store. \"I sell Plan Toys from Thailand, a company initially started by an architect, and so they have very crisp geometric designs and bright colors,\" she notes. Metzger likes toys made from natural materials that provide opportunities for open-ended play. Plan makes many different kinds of toys, from a wooden refrigerator with, of course, wooden ice cubes in the ice-maker, to a whole produce section of wooden fruits and vegetables. Space is at a premium, so Metzger looks for the unique and special. There are some Fair Trade items, toys from recycled materials, and handmade toys from Michigan and various other places in the U.S. \"I have three train sets carved by a family in Kentucky\u2014maple, cherry, ash\u2014very sweet, including a set that carries animals.\" Heirloom rattles are made by a gentleman in Texas who trained as a woodworker. As for games, \"It's a Green Life\" is made in Michigan. Wonderful fairy doors \u2014 which, by the way, only open for fairies \u2014 are made in Ohio. Besides discovering toys when traveling near and far, Metzger finds toys or toymakers online and, often, they locate her first. Toymakers will often send a sample toy and, if she likes the piece, she will consider the line for the store. As for the setting for all this magic, Metzger credits her cousin, Sigrid Wittke, with helping her create a delightful environment and beautiful window displays. In her former career life, Metzger earned a master's degree in clinical psychology and worked in the mental health field for many years. When her daughter (for whom the store was named) was a senior in high school, Metzger decided she was ready to reinvent her life. Metzger's daughter went out of state to college and that gave Metzger time to devote to other things. \"I've always loved toys,\" says Metzger. \"If we went on a trip, London or Italy, we always visited toy stores to see what kinds of things they were selling.\" Opening her own store seemed like a natural extension of that love and of her knowledge of interesting playthings for children. \"I enjoy coming to work every day ,\" Metzger says. Lexi's Toy Box is located at 328 S. Ashley in Ann Arbor. The store is open Tuesday through Friday, 11 a.m. to 6 p.m., and Saturday, 10 a.m. to 6 p.m. For more information, call 734-332-1101 or see lexistoybox.com. We all know those moments when our crying child or a bout of poor behavior prompts us parents, perhaps already on edge, to respond in frustration \u2014 or, worse, with sarcasm or anger. In those moments, we are at a crucial juncture to decide to use our intuition, our creativity, and our inner strengths to address the situation \u2014 our \"Mother Wit,\" as Sonja Knighton calls it. Practice in the art of creating healthy families and the opportunity to cultivate inspired and common-sense parenting tools is what Ann Arbor educator Knighton offers parents in a group of \"Mother Wit\" workshops. She developed the workshops from her own parenting experience and her professional work with children and families. \"In my journeys over the last 14 years,\" she says, \"I saw the deep, unfulfilled need parents have for guidance.\" In fact, the term \"Mother Wit\" comes from a remark of a grandmother with whom Knighton once worked. This simple phrase inspired a response in Knighton to \"offer parents support in developing the intuitive aspects of parenting.\" Each family member's growth and well-being is supported by the Mother Wit approach, she notes, and each family's tool box will be unique. The Mother Wit approach also promotes understanding of family dynamics as they evolve and the family encounters new phases of their lives together . Knighton says, \"Mother Wit parenting recognizes that thriving families are part of thriving communities.\" She notes, \"Families need a supportive, knowledgeable, and invested community in which to navigate the tasks of building family unity.\" It is within this framework that a balance can be brought between family identity and the individual identities of each family member . Knighton developed her workshops based on her own experience and education. She has a K-5 teaching certificate with an early education endorsement. Since graduating from Eastern Michigan University in 2004, she has worked as a preschool teacher. Knighton's thinking is, in part, influenced by the Russian psychologist Lev Vygotsky and the Stages of Development of Erik Erikson. Knighton also likes the writing of Gary Chapman and Ross Campbell, as expressed in the Five Love Languages series, such as Five Love Languages of Children, as well as the work of parenting educators Jim Fay, Charles Fay, and Foster W. Cline, authors of Love and Logic: Taking the Stress Out of Raising Great Kids . Mother Wit workshops are currently being held at Naturopathic Women's HealthCare, 220 N. Fifth Street, Ann Arbor. The sessions run about two hours in length and cost $20.00 per person. The workshop schedule for January through April includes: January 9 -- Wit and Wisdom: Parents will explore and develop their intuitive aspects with a mind to developing tools specific to family needs. February 6 -- Shake It Off: This workshop helps families create options to meet interpersonal challenges or external challenges, be they power struggles, tantrums, or resiliency to the vagaries of life.

Mary Light, ND, MH, LMT, and several naturopath interns at the school \u2014 Tricia Bellew, Carole Florence, Gana Wilson and Alycia Schoof \u2014 will see children at professional and student rates. (Student rates run $20-$30.) Parents will find a soothing, orderly setting, free of the distractions of television and cartoonish posters. The suites of the clinic are decorated with quiet earth tones and pastels, in areas washed with natural sunlight. Light, who is a herbalist and naturopath and director of the school, has added some playful touches, like a big exercise ball in the waiting area and several stuf fed animals. Parents will not find plastic toys or unsuitable reading material. Light emphasizes that this is a family clinic. The clinic offers a health care choice for parents and their children, \"by practitioners sensitively trained in communications and touch therapies, in a gentle and non-intrusive manner.\" Light points out that many of the interns are mothers or grandmothers themselves. And most have had training in various holistic practices, such as healing diets, whole foods, meditation, yoga, gardening, and dance. The clinic offers well-baby and well-child visits, and can address sleeplessness and anxiety, hormone balancing for teens, energy imbalances, and immune system concerns, all centered on a path that follows nature. Practitioners assess through intakes and physical exams that are non-medical and non-intrusive. Assessment involves no lab testing, for practitioners are not attempting to identify and isolate specific medical pathology. They are looking for the constitutional patterns of a child. Staff will then discuss with parents the goals for the child and do an intake based upon the goals. \"An understanding of constitution alone is a valuable guide for a lifetime,\" believes Light. She notes that in Chinese medicine and Ayurvedic practice, assessment of constitutions is a revered, ancient pathway to clues that can be later used in treatment. One method for determining constitution that Light uses involves reading of the iris of the eye. \"Iridology is widely used by medical doctors in Germany,\" she says. An herb lab is maintained on the premises, and the clinic utilizes certain tried-and-true formulations as a component of the practice. As Light explains, \"Certain herbs, as used in soup, for example, or teas or brews, might strengthen the immune system or improve sleep quality, as might changes in diet.\" Parents are given demonstrations of the techniques of supportive care, or education on natural therapeutic applications they can use at home. An example of such a treatment is an abdominal castor oil pack, which is applied externally and provides comfort.

Many of us have experienced the sort of \"flashback\" that might arise from an event in our lives, such as a death, accident, or injury. Any kind of trauma that stirs deep emotion and reinforces negative patterns of avoidance, be they sleeplessness, physical complaints, or irrational fears, can trigger a response, including post-traumatic stress disorder. We might, for example, drive five miles out of our way to avoid the scene of a serious accident, be fearful of the dark, or suffer from nausea, pain, or nightmares. Children who suffer from such trauma are vulnerable in the realms of normal development, schooling, and friendships. Shapiro, now a senior research fellow at the Mental Health Institute in Palo Alto, California, discovered that people could be helped by being guided to move their eyes from side to side (bilaterally) while being led through a process of desensitization. In this manner, she helped clients to re-integrate their traumatic experiences in a healthy way, so they could let them go. In this process, the traumatic memory would not necessarily be forgotten, but it loses its power and effect. Trauma then no longer acts as trigger for emotions every time a troubling thought or specific image appears or a related event happens. EMDR was first implemented as an eye movement technique, hence its name, but researchers have found that other kinds of bilateral stimulation such as hand-tapping, drumming, finger-snapping, viewing bars of light or hearing alternating audio tones can be equally successful when used in the process. Frick is trained to use all these in her practice. The approach Frick takes depends on the child and his or her particular needs. Therapy is combined with the bilateral movement in gentle, guided sessions that help children access and process sensations and feelings connected with the trauma. Each session begins and ends on a positive note, and children, not the therapist, determine the content of the sessions. Each child and trauma is dif ferent, says Frick, and so, as with a ball of yarn being unraveled, the individual unwinding is done in its own way. Children usually leave the session relaxed and in a good mood. Frick makes clear that EMDR is not like hypnosis, in that this therapy does not seek to change consciousness. A final piece of the process of EMDR therapy is deepening the child's sense of positive self-regard. In the brain, there is an amazing ability to digest and store memory in a positive way, Frick says.

New, Fun, and Just Plain Cool Crazy Wisdom Kids in the Community In the brain, there is an amazing ability to digest and store memory in a positive way, Frick says. By taking what was once a scary event and then connecting a strength to it, the child is given a way to not only move beyond the trauma but bolster his or her sense of self-worth.way, EMDR is often used for performance enhancement or for dealing with conditions such as ADD (Attention Deficit Disorder) that cannot be cured, per se, but that bring along related issues. Frick can be reached at 734-665-2397 and further information about her services can be found at www.juliefrick.com. In addition, interested persons can go to www.emdria.org or email her at julie@juliefrick.com. Silence sensed that he was overly fond of longing, as he wrote letter after letter on curly birchbark.So begins Book XV of the Superb Owl Series Volume III, \"Longing for a New Home.\" The series, written by area author Peter Riegel and illustrated by Pamela Hoffer, follows the adventures of an owl called Silence as he makes his way around the world and around his own life. Hoffer and Riegel recently discussed their books, explaining a bit about how the series started, its unique story lines, and where they plan to take it next. Hoffer says, \"Silence seems to have sprung full-blown from Peter's mind. The adventures Silence has reflect the experiences and ideas Peter has expressed...they are a very funny and wry commentary on people Peter has met or situations he has encountered.\" She explains that there is not a one-to-one match between a character and his real-life inspiration, but that Riegel offers \"droll or quirky observations\" about people or events in general. \"Silence,\" she says, \"is really Peter!\" The theme of longing returns often in the Superb Owl Series. Hoffer notes that many story titles suggest seeking \u2014 for example, \"Silence Has a Dream,\" \"Silence Digs Well,\" and \"Aimless Expedition.\" In addition, Riegel's interests work their way into story lines, such as his fondness for math, his world travels, and even juggling \u2014 which he does occasionally (as well as walking a tightrope), not for show, he says, \"but as a technical challenge and as a meditative practice.\" The first book started as a project that sprang from a story Riegel wrote. He showed it to Hoffer, who then volunteered to illustrate it. Four more stories followed and the pair put these together as a little book (V olume I) for Christmas presents. \"The fun of illustrating them,\" Hoffer says, \"is to keep from pinning down the meaning and letting the drawings just tickle the reader's mind. They are tiny little books, good for the hip pocket on a mountain top.\" Although not written specifically for children, the books, with their \"Zen-like, crazy wisdom and quirky story lines,\" as Hoffer dubs them, both amuse and delight all ages. Hoffer notes, \"Children are natural philosophers, willing to ask all the hard questions. The vocabulary and ironic observations of the books are adult enough, or sophisticated or just weird enough, to be fun for adults, but children like them because children don't demand everything make 'sense.' \" In addition, children like all the animals that populate Silence' s life. Riegel introduces us, says Hoffer, to \"a bear, worms, dolphins, a companionate gerbil, penguins and bees, a cormorant, a raven, a turtle\u2014even an aplysia, a sea creature used in the study of memory.\" And Silence is a world traveler. Settings for stories range from Portugal to Iceland to the Falkland Islands to Silence's familiar woods, and inspire Hoffer to search out images and information to help her create the pen-and-ink illustrations for those places. Hoffer is a social worker in clinical private practice, in her \"bread and butter life,\" as she calls it. She is mostly retired, except for clients who want to come back for a 'booster shot.' \" From 1980 to the late 1990s, she taught a parenting class called \"Becoming the Parent You Want to Be,\" co-developed and taught with Peggy Lippitt. She is spending more serious time painting lately. She shares a studio with a friend and some of her work can be seen at www.pamhoffer.blogspot.com. Riegel, a software engineer with a mathematics degree from U of M, wrote many Silence episodes \"to relate in some way with issues of writing or performing music, particularly the Silence stories that feature Raven and strands of rope.\" He states, \"Each strand of rope may be considered to correspond to a part of a piece in Paganini's 'Centone di Sonate' for guitar and violin, which totals thirty-six parts.\" The music theme appeared from the first. Riegel states that, in fact, \"the first three words of the first story are the title of an album by Jefferson Airplane, 'The Walking Owl.' \" Trained as a classical guitarist, Riegel has played over 400 free performances at retirement communities in the Ann Arbor and Chicago areas. An impromptu performance of \"Cherry Blossoms (Sakura)\" on a guitar, deftly recorded by his friend, David Berger, can be seen online at www.youtube.com/watch?v=jeni4yq6AIE The Superb Owl series is now available at Crazy Wisdom Bookstore in Ann Arbor. Though new volumes of the books are not appearing annually as they once did, Riegel aims to complete 17 volumes. Hoffer says, \"I can't imagine not being enticed to keep doing this, as long as Silence is wandering about, having such quirky adventures as he does.\" You can contact Hoffer at 734-663-3435 or phoffer@umich.edu.

If this happens to you, it could present a wonderful opportunity to take stock of one's life and one's personal tendencies and relationships. New, healthier choices can be made from these observations. What a marvelous space winter allows for this deeper life reflection! However, if this self-reflection and quietness turns into serious depression, isolation, and fatigue that impedes growth and health, outside interventions may be necessary to promote healing through this time. For the \"winter blues,\" also called Seasonal Affective Disorder (S.A.D.), the following interventions have been found to be helpful for many people. Phototherapy: Typical treatment involves close exposure to a light box that emits 10,000 lux (intensity) of filtered fluorescent light for about 30 minutes each morning throughout the winter season. Spending time outside exposed to sunlight on a daily basis, if possible, is also powerful. Dawn simulator: A great adjunct to phototherapy, this device attaches to light fixtures by one's bedside and simulates an artificial dawn, typically starting 1 to 1-1/2 hours prior to normal waking time. Cognitive-Behavioral Therapy (CBT): This form of psychotherapy examines thoughts, emotions, and behaviors that contribute to depression and trains one to have healthier responses. A 2008 study from the University of Vermont found that participants who received a course of CBT both reduced their depressive symptoms during the winter of their treatment and were less likely to experience a recurrence of depression the following year. These studies also suggested that CBT, and CBT combined with phototherapy, may be more effective than phototherapy alone. Negative ion exposure: These negatively charged particles are emitted in nature and are found near waterfalls, after a rainstorm, near pounding surf, circulating in mountain air, and even from burning beeswax candles. There is some evidence that exposure to negative ions on a daily basis has an antidepressant effect similar to phototherapy. Daily aerobic exercise: This is one of the most powerful treatments for depression and can be combined with any other approach. Social contact: This is critical when one's tendency may be to isolate. Dietary changes: Instead of overloading on processed carbohydrates, include protein-rich foods in your diet such as fish or eggs. Avoid products containing white sugar or white flour and consume a variety of fruits and vegetables. An evaluation from a nutritionist can be helpful. Color therapy: Surround yourself with, and dress in, warm colors like reds, oranges and yellows that reflect the color of the sun. Color therapy can stimulate subtle mood and ener gy shifts. Nutritional/hormonal balance: Get evaluation and treatment for conditions such as vitamin D deficiency or hypothyroidism. Seek help: Meet with a mental health professional who can guide you in an individual treatment plan, especially if your depression is more severe. Whether your response to winter is joy, occasional blues, or serious depression, and whether nurturing your healing using any of the above interventions is necessary, it is important to remember the symbolism of what this season offers. Underneath the dormant ground, the earth is stirring with seeds and life force that will spring with new growth when the timing is right. What is the new growth you wish to see in your life in the coming year? What changes \u2014 inner and outer \u2014 are needed to cultivate this growth? This is the time to reflect on your life, to set forth these intentions for new growth, and to begin to plan for how any personal changes will be nurtured and allowed to bloom in the spring. ### (Marnie Burkman can be contacted at 734-913-0345 or michiganintegrative.com.)By Dr. Marnie BurkmanPhoto by Rachael Waring \"In dark whisperings of new beginnings.\" ~ Mara FreemanGraceful snowfall...icy chill in the air...dim sunlight...long nights. Winter is a quiet, beautiful, inwardly reflective season. For many people, it also heralds a time where one's mood drops into depression. There is a tendency to withdraw from activities that otherwise would be enjoyable. Energy levels and food choices are thrown off-balance, and thought patterns become more negative. The energy of winter is one of quiet stillness and, in that stillness, darker tendencies of the mind and emotions can arise and become more obvious. There are various theories as to why this happens, from low vitamin D levels or release of excess melatonin (a hormone that regulates sleep/wake cycles) to the psychological response of turning a naturally inwardly-reflective time against oneself.

She is board certified in both general psychiatry and integrative holistic medicine and has a private practice treating adults at Aprill Wellness Center.

Call 717-8513 or mpfox@umich.edu.By Nancy Bahlman Have you ever wondered why a person is drawn to one room in a house and not another, or why a person chooses a particular seat in a room? The energetic connection indicated in a person's Local Space astrological chart can answer these questions. A Local Space (LS) chart shows your relationship to the area or building in which you live or work. It is calculated using your birth data\u2014date, time and place \u2014 as is a standard birth (natal) chart. However, the LS chart is based on where you currently live or work, not where you were born. An LS chart shows the exact degrees of the planets around a 360-degree wheel but without house cusps and signs. Instead, the planets are aligned by compass direction (north, south, east or west), as are maps. Lines are drawn through the wheel's center to the planet's location, so that the planetary placements become directional pointers. Once you have your LS chart, it can be copied onto a transparency and placed over a floor plan of a house or office. Place the center of the chart over the center of the building and align them both directionally. To illustrate, included with this article is a copy of the layout of my home with my LS chart super -imposed over the floor plan. The chart shows the planets' locations in relationship to the building, and, therefore, the energy/function/activity associated with the planets that would flourish in those locations. For example, the Moon in a person's chart relates to food, cooking, and nurturing; so it would make sense that the cook's Moon line would align with the kitchen. The Sun relates to performing, self-expression, and visibility\u2014where a person \"shines\"; so the Sun area might align with a person's special chair, study, or area where one would practice a talent. In addition to the Moon and Sun, there are eight planets in any astrological chart. Each of these also relates to particular energies or functions: Mercury relates to information, writing, speaking, learning, and working with hands; so the Mercury line would be a good area for a phone, desk, or office, as well as where a massage therapist could work on clients. Venus is the social planet and relates to beauty, culture, and comfort; so the Venus line would be an area to entertain friends, put on makeup, or work on crafts. Mars is the planet of energy, exercise, and working with tools; so the Mars line would be an effective area for your exercise equipment or work bench. Jupiter is the planet of fun, nature, pets, education, religion, and public relations; so the Jupiter line would be a place for games, pets, prayer or developing marketing campaigns. Saturn is the planet of career, organizing, and management; so the Saturn area would be perfect for an office or place for planning, keeping files, and completing tasks. Uranus is the planet of friends and associates as well as technology and electronics; so the Uranus line is a place for the computer and other electronic equipment. Neptune is the planet of intuition, sleep, meditation, music, and creative writing; so you could happily pursue any of these activities on the Neptune line. Pluto is the planet of control, passion, and elimination and so relates to research, therapy, and sex, as well as being a good location for garbage or toilets. The LS chart also can be used to determine the energy in an individual room. Find the center of the room on a floor plan and then place the center of the LS chart over it. Several years ago, a psychic development group was meeting in the living room of my home. I noticed that each person chose the same seat each week. I ran the LS charts for all of the participants and found that they were each instinctively sitting on their Neptune (meditation) line! LS charts also can be placed on a map of one's city or county. Planetary lines in the LS chart can be extended beyond the house to the surrounding area, to assist in choosing a gym, grocery store, bank, etc., based on the directional ener gy of the planets in your chart.Local Space Astrology - Aligning your Home and Work Space to your Energy An LS chart can also be created for a business, in order to energetically choose the best locations of various business functions within the building.I'm often asked if Local Space is the same as Feng Shui, and the answer is \"no,\" but both can enhance the energetic use of space. Feng Shui deals with characteristics of the compass directions, while Local Space focuses on the functions of the planets. ### Nancy Bahlman is a member of the Southeast Michigan Astrologers' Round Table (SMART).

(Jackson Kaguri was raised in Uganda, graduated from Makarere University, and was a visiting scholar at Columbia University. He is the associate director of development at Michigan State University in East Lansing, Michigan, and the founder and director of the Nyaka and Kutamba AIDS Orphans Schools in Uganda. He will be appearing in the Crazy Wisdom Tea Room on Sunday, April 3 rd at 1pm.) Rachel Pastiva: Your book, The Price of Stones: Building a School for My Village , tells of your journey that led to the founding of the Nyaka AIDS Orphans School. Can you speak briefly on the life events that led to your dream of opening the first tuition free school for orphans? Jackson Kaguri: The turning point was the death of my brother. He died in 1996 leaving three children; then my sister died in 1997, leaving one son. I took over taking care of their children, but each time I took these nieces and nephews of mine to see their grandparents, many grandmothers would bring their orphaned children asking me for a pen, pencil, books, and tuition. I decided I wanted to be an uncle to more than my relatives and save more lives from poverty and systematic deprivation. RP: You faced many obstacles, including opposition from your father and other villagers. Can you explain why they did not support a school for AIDS orphans? Jackson Kaguri: My father educated me and my siblings by selling his chickens, goats, cows, and land. You will have to know that parents send their children to school so that we can take care of them later in life. My dad thought now that I was helping the whole community, his investment was going to everyone.Other people have seen corrupt officials who keep giving them things with a catch. I build a school, you give me a vote. So people thought that I wanted something in return.The last group was the religious people. Uganda has many religious divisions; people thought that I was building a Seventh-Day Adventist school. If I had done that, many people would have even stopped sending their children to this school. Our schools are non-denominational and therefore every child who meets requirements can attend. RP: Can you describe what the Nyaka AIDS Orphans Project offers to students?Jackson Kaguri: Peace, love, and care. On top of that we provide education, uniforms, pens, pencils, two meals a day, healthcare, clean water, housing with grannies and guardians, and a library -- to the whole community . RP: On the Nyaka AIDS Orphans Project website, nyakaschool.org, it states: \"The SCHOOLS program is now supported by the HEALTH, GRANDMOTHERS and COMMUNITY programs.\" Can you discuss what these programs are and how they benefit the schools program? Spotlight on Jackson Kaguri ~ Author of The Price of Stones: Building a School for My Village Jackson Kaguri: All this is a holistic approach to address children's lives and enrich their educational experiences. RP: What are some future goals of the Nyaka AIDS Orphans Project, and what are some ways that people can help reach them? Jackson Kaguri: We are building a secondary school next year. People can give money, time in volunteering, talents in helping us with many tasks, or organize Nyaka friends in their communities. Please consider adding our children in your will. Follow me at http://twitter.com/twejaka ###\"My father educated me and my siblings by selling his chickens, goats, cows, and land.
