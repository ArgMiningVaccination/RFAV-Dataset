CLINICAL PARTICULARS 4.1 Therapeutic indications Treatment of influenza Ebilfumin is indicated in adults and children including full -term neonates who present with symptoms typical of influenza, when influenza virus is circulating in the communit y. Efficacy has been demonstrated when treatment is initiated within two days of first onset of symptoms. Prevention of influenza 3 - Post-exposur e prevention in individuals 1 year of age or older following contact with a clinically diagnosed influenza case when influenza virus is circulat ing in the communit y. - The appropr iate use of Ebilfumin for prevention of influenza should be deter mined on a case by case basis by the circu mstances and the populat ion requiring protection. In exceptional situations (e.g. in case of a mismatch between the circulating and vaccine virus strains, and a pande mic situation) seasonal prevention could be considered in individuals one year of age or older. - Ebilfumin is indicated for post-exposure prevention of influenza in infants less than 1 year of age during a pande mic influenz a outbreak (see section 5.2). Ebilfumin is not a substitute for influenza vaccination . The use of antivirals for the treatm ent and prevent ion of influenza should be deter mined on the basis of official recommendations. Decisions regarding the use of oseltamivir for treatment and prophylaxis should take into consideration what is known about the characteristics of the circulating influenza viruses, available infor mation on influenza drug susceptibility patterns for each season and the impact of the disease in different geographical areas and patient populations (see section 5.1). 4.2 Posology and method of administration Posology Ebilfumin hard capsules are bioequivalent form ulations. 75 mg doses can be ad ministered as either : - one 75 mg capsule or - one 30 mg capsule plus one 45 mg capsule . Commercially manufactured oseltamivir powder for oral suspension (6 mg/ml) is the preferred product for paediatric and adult patients who have difficulties swallowing capsules or where lower doses are needed. Adults, and a dolescents 13 years and over Treatment : The recomme nded oral dose is 75 mg oseltamivir twice daily for 5 days for adolescents (13 to 17 years of age) and adults. Body Weight Recommended dose for 5 days Recommended dose for 10 days* Immunocompromised Patients > 40 kg 75 mg twice daily 75 mg twice daily * The recommended treatment duration in immunocompromised adults and adolescents is 10 days. See Special Populations, Immunocompromised Patients for more information. Treatment should be initia ted as soon as possible within the first two days of onset of symptoms of influenza. Post-exposure preventio n: The recomme nded dose for prevention of influenza following close contact with an infected individual is 75 mg oseltamivir once daily for 10 days for adolescents (13 to 17 years of age) and adults. Body Weight Recommended dose for 10 days Recommended dose for 10 days Immunocompromised Patients > 40 kg 75 mg once daily 75 mg once daily Therap y shoul d begin as soon as possible within two days of exposure to an infected individual. 4 Prevention during an influenza epidemic in the communit y: The recommended dose for prevention of influenza during a community outbreak is 75 mg oselta mivir once daily for up to 6 weeks (or up to 12 weeks in immunocompromised patients , see sections 4.4, 4.8 and 5.1). Paediatric population Children 1 to 12 yea rs of age Ebilfumin 30 mg, 45 mg and 75 mg capsules are available for infants and children 1 year of age or older Treatment : The following weight -adjusted dosing regimens are recommended for treatment of infants and children 1 year of age or older: Body Weight Recommen ded dose for 5 days Recommended dose for 10 days * Immunocompromised Patients 10 kg to 15 kg 30 mg twice daily 30 mg twice daily > 15 kg to 23 kg 45 mg twice daily 45 mg twice daily > 23 kg to 40 kg 60 mg twice daily 60 mg twice daily > 40 kg 75 mg twice daily 75 mg twice daily *The recommended treatment duration in immunocompromised children (1 year old) is 10 days. See Special Populations, Immunocompromised Patients for more information. Treatment should be initia ted as soon as possible within the first two days of onset of symptoms of influenza. Post-exposure preventio n: The recommended post-exposure prevention dose of Ebilfumin is: Body Weight Recommen ded dose for 10 days Recommended dose for 10 days For Immunocomprmised Patients 10 kg to 15 kg 30 mg once daily 30 mg once daily > 15 kg to 23 kg 45 mg once daily 45 mg once daily > 23 kg to 40 kg 60 mg once daily 60 mg once daily > 40 kg 75 mg once daily 75 mg once daily Prevention during an influenza epidemic in the communit y: Prevention during an influenza epidemic has not been studied in children below 12 years of age. Infants 0 - 12 months of age Treatment : The recomme nded treatment dose for infants 0 - 12 months of age is 3 mg/kg twice daily. This is based upon pharmacokinetic and safet y data indicating that this dose in infants 0 - 12 months provides plasma concentrations of the pro-drug and active metabolite that are anticipated to be clinically efficaci ous with a safety profile comparable to that seen in older children and adults (see section 5.2). The following dosing regimen is recommended for treatment of infants 0 - 12 months of age: Body weight* Recommen ded dose for 5 days Recomm ended dose for 10 days ** Immunocompromised Patients 3 kg 9 mg twice daily 9 mg twice daily 4 kg 12 mg twice daily 12 mg twice daily 5 kg 15 mg twice daily 15 mg twice daily 6 kg 18 mg twice daily 18 mg twice daily 7 kg 21 mg twice daily 21 mg twice daily 5 8 kg 24 mg twice daily 24 mg twice daily 9 kg 27 mg twice daily 27 mg twice daily 10 kg 30 mg twice daily 30 mg twice daily * This table is not intended to contain all possible weights for this population. For all patients under the age of 1 year, 3 mg/kg should be used to determine dose regardless of the weight of the patient. Treatment should be initia ted as soon as possible within the first two days of onset of symptoms of influenza. ** The recommended duration in immunocompromised infants (0- 12 months old) is 10 days. See Special Populations, Immunocompromised Patients for more information. This dosing recommendation is not intend ed for premature infan ts, i.e. those with a post- conceptual age less than 36 weeks. Insufficient data are availab le for these patients, in whom different dosing may be required due to the immaturity of ns. Post-exposure preventio n: The recomme nded prophylaxis dose for infants less than 1 year of age during a pande mic influenza outbreak is half of the daily treatment dose. This is based upon clinical data in infan ts and children 1 year of age or older and adults showing that a prophylaxis dose equivalent to half the daily treatment dose is clinically efficacious for the prevention of influenza. The following age-adjusted dosing prophylaxis regimen is recommen ded for infants 0 - 12 months of age (see Section 5.2 for exposure simulation) : Age Recommen ded dose for 10 days Recommended dose for 10 days Immunocompromised Patients 0 - 12 months 3 mg/kg once daily 3 mg/kg once daily This dosing recommendation is not intend ed for premature infants, i.e. those with a pos t- conceptual age less than 36 weeks. Insufficient data are availab le for these patients, in whom different dosing may be required due to the immaturity of physiological functio ns. Prevention during an influenza epidemic in the communit y: Prevention during an influenza epidemic has not been studied in children 0-12 months of age. For instructions on preparing the extemporaneous formulation, see section 6.6. Special popul ations Hepatic impairment No dose adjus tment is required for treatment or for preven tion in patien ts with hepatic dysfunction. No studies have been carried out in paediatric patients with hepatic disorder. Renal impai tment is recomme nded for adults and adolescents (13 to 17 years of age) with moderate or severe renal impairment. Recommended doses are detai led in the table below. Creatinine clearance Recommen ded dose for treatment > 60 (ml/min) 75 mg twice daily > 30 to 60 (ml/min) 30 mg twice daily > 10 to 30 (ml/min) 30 mg once daily 10 (ml/min) Not recommended (no data available) Haemodial ysis patients 30 mg after each haemodial ysis session Peritoneal dialysis patient s* 30 mg single dose *Data derived from studies in conti nuous ambulato carbox ylate is expected to be higher when automated peritoneal dialysis (APD) mode is used. Treat ment mode can be switched from APD to CAPD if considered necessary by a neph rologist. 6 Prevention of influenza : Dose adjus tment is recommended for adults and adolescents (13 to 17 years of age) with moderate or severe renal impairment as detailed in the table below. Creatinine clearance Recommen ded dose for prevention > 60 (ml/min) 75 mg once daily > 30 to 60 (ml/min) 30 mg once daily > 10 to 30 (ml/min) 30 mg every second day 10 (ml/min) Not recommended (no data available) Haemodial ysis patients 30 mg after every second haemodial ysis session Peritoneal dialysis patient s* 30 mg once weekly *Data derived from studies in conti nuous ambulato carbox ylate is expected to be higher when automated peritoneal dialysis (APD) mode is used. Treat ment mode can be switched from APD to CAPD if considered necessary by a neph rologist. There is insufficient clinical data available in infants and children (12 years of age and younger) with renal impairment to be able to make any dosing recommendation. Elderly No dose adjus tment is required, unless there is evidence of modera te or severe renal impairment. Immunocompromised patients Treatment: For treatment of influenza, the recommended duration for immunocompromised patients is 10 days (see sections 4.4, 4.8 and 5.1). No dose adjustment is necessary. Treatment should be initiated as soon as possible within the first two days of onset of symptoms of influenza. Seasonal prophylaxis: Longer durat ion of seasonal proph ylaxis up to 12 weeks has been evaluated in immunoc ompromised patients (see sections 4.4, 4.8 and 5.1). Method of administration Oral use. Patients who are unable to swallow capsules may receive appropriate doses of an oseltamivir suspension. . 4.3 Contraindications Hypersensitivity to the active substance or to any of the excipients listed in section 6.1. 4.4 Special warnings and precautions for use Oseltamivir is effective only against illness caused by influenza viruses. There is no evidence for efficacy of oselta mivir in any illness caused by agents other than influenza viruses (see section 5.1). Oseltamivir is not a substitute for influenza vaccination Use of oseltamivir must not affect the evaluation of indivi duals for annual influenza vaccinat ion. The protection against influenza lasts only as long as oseltamivir is administered. Oseltamivir should be used for the treatment and preventi on of influenza only when reliable epide miological data indicate that influenza virus is circulating in the community. Susceptibility of circulating influenza virus strains to oselta mivir has been shown to be highly variable (see section 5.1). Therefore, prescribers should take into account the most recent infor mation available on oselta mivir susceptibility patterns of the currently circulating viruses when deciding whether to use oseltamivir . Severe concomitant condit ion 7 No infor mation is available regarding the safety and efficacy of oselt amivir in patients with any medical condition sufficien tly severe or unstable to be considered at imminent risk of requir ing hospitalisation. Immunoc ompro mised patients The mivir treatment or proph ylaxis of influenza in immunoc ompromised patients has not been firmly established (see section 5.1). Cardiac / respiratory diseas e Efficacy of oselt amivir in the treatment of subjects with chronic cardiac diseas e and/or respiratory disease has not been established. No difference in the incidence of complications was observe d between the treatment and placebo groups in this population (see section 5.1). Paediatric population No data allowing a dose recommendation for premature children (< 36 weeks post-conceptual age) are currently available. Severe renal impairment Dose adjus tment is recommended for both treatment and prevention in adolescents (13 to 17 years of age) and adults with severe renal impairment. There is insufficient clinical data available in infants and children (1 year of age or older) with renal impairment to be able to make any dosing recommendation (see sections 4.2 and 5.2). Neurops ychiatric events Neurops ychiatric events have been reported during administration of oseltamivir in patients with influenza, especially in children and adolescents. These events are also experienced by patients with influenza without oselta mivir administration. Patients should be closely monitored for behav ioural changes, and the benefits and risks of continu ing treatment should be carefully evaluated for each patient (see section 4.8). Excipient This medicine contains less than 1 mmol sodium (23 mg) per capsule, that is to say essentially 'sodium -free'. 4.5 Interaction with other medicinal products and other forms of interaction Pharmacokinetic properties of oseltamivir, such as low protein binding and metabolism independent of the CYP450 and glucuronidase systems (see section 5.2), suggest that clinically significant drug interactions via these mechanisms are unlikely. Probenecid No dose adjustment is required when co -administering with probenecid in patients with normal renal function. Co- administration of probenecid, a potent inhibitor of the anionic pathway of renal tubular secretion, results in an approximate 2 -fold increase in exposure to the active metabolite of oseltamivir. Amoxicillin Oseltamivir has no kinetic interaction with amoxicillin, which is eliminated via the same pathway, suggesting that oseltamivir interaction with this pathway is weak. Renal elimination Clinically important drug interactions involvi ng competition for renal tubular secretion are unlikely, due to the known safety margin for most of these substances, the elimination characteristics of the active metabolite (glomerular filtration and anionic tubular secretion) and the excretion capacity of these pathways. However, care should be taken when prescribing oseltamivir in subjects when taking co-excreted agents with a narrow therapeutic margin (e.g. chlorpropamide, methotrexate, phenylbutazone). 8 Additional information No pharmacokinetic interactions between oseltamivir or its major metabolite have been observed when oseltamivir warfarin (in su bjects stable on warfarin and without influenza). 4.6 Fertility, pregnancy and lactation Pregnancy Influenza is associated with adverse pregnancy and foetal outcomes, with a risk of major congenital malformations, including congenital heart defects. A large amount of data on oseltamivir exposure of pregnant women from post-mark eting reports and observational studies (more than 1000 exposed outcomes during the first trimester) indi cate no malformative nor feto/neonatal toxicity by oseltamivir . However, in one observational study, while the overall malformation risk was not increased, the results for major congenital heart defects diagnosed within 12 months of birth were not conclusive. In this study, the rate of major congenital heart defects following oseltamivir exposure during the first trimester was 1.76% (7 infants out of 397 pregnancies) compared to 1.01% in unexposed pregnancies from the general population (Odds Ratio 1.75, 95% Confidence Interval 0.51 to 5.98). The clinical significance of this f inding is not clear, as the study had limited power. Additionally, this study was too small to reliably assess individual types of major malformations; moreover women exposed to oseltamivir and women unexposed could not be made fully comparable, in particular whether or not they had influenza. Animal studies do not indicate reproductive toxicity (see section 5.3). The use of oseltamivir may be considered during pregnancy if necessary and after considering the available safety and benefit infor mation (for data on benefit in pregnant women please refer to section 5.1 \"treatment of influenza in pregnant women\"), and the pathogeni city of the circulating influenza virus strain . Breast feeding In lactating rats, oselta mivir and the active metabolite are excret ed in milk. Very limited information is available on children breast -fed by mothers taking oselt amivir and on excretion of oselt amivir in breast milk. Limited data demonstrated that oselt amivir and the active metabolite were detected in breast milk, however the levels were low, which would result in a subtherapeutic dose to the infant. Considering this infor mation, the pathogenicity of the circulating influenza virus strain and the under lying condition of the breastfeedi ng woman, administration of oselta mivir may be considered, where there are clear potential benefits to breastfeed ing mothers. Fertility Based on preclinical data, there is no evidence that oseltamivir has an effect on male or female fertility (see section 5.3). 4.7 Effects on ability to drive and use machines Oseltamivir has no influence on the ability to drive and use machines. 4.8 Undesirable effects Summary of the safety profile The overall safety profile of oseltamivir is based on data from 6049 adult/adolescent and 1473 paediatric patients treated with oseltamivir or placebo for influenza, and on data from 3990 adult/adolescent and 253 paediatric patients receiving oseltamivir or placebo/no treatment for the prophylaxis of influenza in clinical trials. In addition, 245 immunocompromised patients (including 7 9 adolescents and 39 children) received oseltamivir for the treatment of influenza and 475 immunoco mpromised patients (including 18 children, of these 10 oseltamivir and 8 placebo) received oseltamivir or placebo for the prophylaxis of influ enza. In adults/adolescents, the most commonly reported adverse reacti ons (ARs) were nausea and vomiting in the treatm ent studies, and nausea in the prevention studies. The majority of these ARs were reported on a single occasion on either the first or second treatment day and resolved spont aneously within 1-2 days. In children, the most commonly reported adverse reaction was vomiting. In the majority of patients, these ARs did not lead to discontinuation of oseltamivir. The following serious adverse reactions have been rarely reported since oselt amivir has been ychiatric disorders, see section 4.4.) Tabulated list of adverse reactions The ARs listed in the tables below fall into the following categories: Very common ( 1/10), rare ( 0 to < 1/1,000), and very rare (< 1/10, 000). ARs are added to the appropriate catego ry in the tables according to the pooled analysis from clinical studies. Treatment and prevention of influenza in adults and adolescents: In adult/adol escent treatment and prevention studies, ARs that occurred the most frequently at the reco mmended dose (75 mg bid for 5 days for treatment and 75 mg od for up to 6 weeks for prop hylaxis) are shown in Table 1. The safety profile reported in subjects who received the recomme nded dose of oseltamivir for proph ylaxis (75 mg once daily for up to 6 weeks) was qualitatively similar to that seen in the treatment studies, despite a longer duration of dosing in the prophylaxis studies.

Of those, 851 children receiv ed treatment with oselt amivir suspension. A total of 158 children recei ved the recommended dose of oseltamivir once daily in a post-exposure proph ylaxis study in households (n = 99), a 6-week paediatric seasonal proph ylaxis study (n = 49) and a 12- week paediatric seasonal proph ylaxis study in immunoc ompromised subjects (n = 10). Table 2 shows the most frequently reported ARs from paediatric clinical trials. Table 2 Adverse reactions in studies investigating oseltamivir for treatment and prevention of influen za in children (age/weight -based dosing [30 mg to 75 mg o.d.]) System Organ Class (SOC) Adverse reactions according to frequency Very comm on Common Uncommon Rare 11 Infections and infestations Otitis media, Nervous system disorders Head ache Eye disorde rs: Conjunctivit is (including red eyes, eye discharge and eye pain) Ear and labyrinth disorders: Earache Tympanic membrane disorder Respiratory, and atopic dermatitis) Desc ription of select ed adverse reactions Psychiatric disorders and nervous system disorders Influenza can be associated with a variety of neurologic and behavioural symptoms which can include events such as hallucinations, deliriu m, and abno rmal behaviour, in some cases resulting in fatal outco mes. These events may occur in the setting of encephalitis or encephalopathy but can occur without obvious severe disease. In patients with influenza who were receiving oseltamivir , there have been postmarketing reports of convulsions and delirium (including sympto ms such as altered level of conscious ness, confusion, abnor mal behaviour, delus ions, hallucin ations, agitation, anxie ty, nightmares), in a very few cases resulting in self-inju ry or fatal outcomes. These events were reported primarily among paediatric and adolescent patients and often had an abrupt onset and rapid resolution. The contribution of oseltamivir to those events is unkn own. Such neurops ychiatric events have also been reported in patients with influenza who were not taking oseltamivir . Hepato -bilia ry disorders Hepato -biliary system disorders, includ ing hepatitis and elevated liver enzymes in patients with influenza -like illness. These cases include fatal fulminant hepatitis/hepatic failure. Other special populat ions Paediatric populat ion (infants less than one year of age) In two studi es to character ise the pharmacok inetics, pharmacod ynamics and safety profile of oselt amivir therapy in 135 influenza infected childr en less than one year of age, the safety profile was similar among age cohorts with vomiting, diarrohea and diaper rash being the most frequent ly reported adverse even ts (see section 5.2). Insufficient data are available for infants who have a post- conceptual age of less than 36 weeks. 12 Safety information available on oselt amivir administered for treatment of influenza in infants less than one year of age from prospective and retrospective observational studies (comprising together more than 2,400 infants of that age class), epidemiological databases research and postmarketing reports suggest that the safety profile in infants less than one year of age is similar to the established safety profile of children aged one year and older. Older people and patients with chronic cardiac and/or respiratory disease The populatio n included in the influenza treatment studies is comprised of otherwise healthy adults/adolescents and patients \"at risk\" (patients at higher risk of developing complications associated with influen za, e.g. older people and patien ts with chronic cardiac or respirat ory disease). In general, the safety profile in the patients \"at risk\" was qualitative ly similar to that in otherwise healthy adults/adolescents. Immunocompromised patients The treatment of influenza in immunocompromised patients were evaluated in two studies receiving standard dose or high dose regimens ( double dose or triple dose) of oseltamivir (see section 5.1 ). The safety profile of oseltamivir observed in the se studies was consistent with that observed in previous clinical trials where osel tamivir was administered for treatment of influenza in non - immunocompromised patients across all age groups (otherwise healthy patients or \"at risk\" patients [i.e., those with respiratory and/or cardiac co -morbidities]). The most frequent adverse reaction reported in immunocompromised children was vomiting (28%) . In a study in 475 immunoc ompromised patients, includ ing 18 children 1 to 12 years of age and older, the safety profile in the 238 patients who received oseltamivir was consistent with that previ ously observed in oseltamivir proph ylaxis clinical studies. Children with pre-existing bronchial asthma In general, the adverse reaction profile in childr en with pre-existing bronchial asthma was qualitatively similar to that of otherwise healthy child ren. Reporting of suspected adverse reactions Reporting suspected adverse reactions after authorisation of the medicinal product is important. It allows continued monitoring of the benefit/risk balance of the medicinal product. Healthcare professionals are asked to report any suspected adverse reactio ns via the national reporting system listed in Appendix V . 4.9 Overdose Reports of overdoses with o seltamivir have been received from clinical trials and during post - marketing experience. In the majority of cases reporting overdose, no adverse events were reported. Adverse events reported following overdose were similar in nature and distribution to those observ ed with therapeutic doses of o seltamivir , described in section 4.8 Undesirable effects. No specific antidote is known. Paediatric population Overdose has been reported more frequently for children than adults and adolescents. Caution should be exercised when preparing o seltamivir oral suspension and when administering o seltamivir products to children. 5. PHARMACOLOGICAL PROPERTIES 5.1 Pharmacodynamic properties 13 Pharmacothe rapeutic carbox ylate). The influenza virus neura minidase enzy mes, which are glycoproteins found on the virion surface. Viral neuraminidase enzyme activity is important both for viral entry into uninfected cells and for the releas e of recently formed virus particles from infect ed cells, and for the further spread of infectious virus in the body . Oseltamivir carbo xylate inhibits influe in vitro . Oselta mivir phosphate inhibits influenza virus infection and replication in vitro. Oselta mivir given orally inhibits influenza A and B virus replication and pathogenicity in vivo in animal models of influenza infection at antiviral exposures similar to that achieved in man with 75 mg twice daily . Antiviral activi ty of oseltamivir was supported for influenza A and B by experimental challenge studies in healthy volunteers. Neur aminidase enzy me IC50 values for oselt amivir for clinically isolated influenza A ranged from 0.1 nM to 1.3 nM, and for influenza B was 2.6 nM. Higher IC50 values for influ enza B, up to a median of 8.5 nM, have been observed in published studies. Clinical studies Treatment of influenza infection The indication is based on clinical studies of naturally occurring influenza in which the predom inant infection was influenza A. Oseltamivir is effective only against illnesses cause d by influenza virus. Statistical analyses are therefore presented only for influenza -infected subjects. In the pooled treatment study popula tion, which included both influ enza-positive and -negative subjects (ITT), primary efficacy was reduced proport ionally to the number of influen za-negative individuals. In the overall treatment popul ation, influenza infection was confir med in 67 % (range 46 % to 74 %) of the recruited patients. Of the older subjects, 64 % were influenza -positive and of those with chronic cardiac and/or respirato ry disease 62 % were influenza -positive. In all phase III trea tment studies, patients were recruited only during the period in which influenza was circulating in the local communit y. Adults and adolescents 13 years of age and older: Patients were eligible if they reported within 36 hours of onset of symptoms, had fever 37.8 \u00b0C, accompanied by at least one respiratory symptom (cough, nasal symptoms or sore throat) and at least one systemic symptom (myalgia, chills/sweats, mala ise, fatigue or headache). In a pooled analysis of all influenza -positive adults and adolescents (N = 2,413) enrolled into treatment studies, oseltamivir 75 mg twice daily for 5 days reduced the median duration of influenza illness by approxi mately one day from 5.2 days (95 % CI 4.9 - 5.5 days) in the placebo group to 4.2 days (95 % CI 4.0 - 4.4 days; p 0.0001). The propor tion of subjects who develope d specified lower respiratory tract complications (mainly bronchitis) treated with antibiotics was reduced from 12.7 % (135/ 1,063) in the placebo group to 8.6 % (116/ 1,350) in the oseltamivir treated populatio n (p = 0.0012). Treatment of influenza in high risk population s: The median duration of influenza illness in older subjects ( 65 years) and in subjects with chronic cardiac and/or respiratory disease receiving oselta mivir 75 mg twice daily for 5 days was not reduced significant ly. The total duration of fever was reduced by one day in the groups treated with oseltamivir. In influenza-positive older people , oselt amivir significantly reduced the incidence of specified lower respiratory tract complications (mainly bronchitis) treated with antibio tics from 19 % (52/268) in the placebo group to 12 % (29/250) in the oseltamivir treated populat ion (p = 0.015 6). 14 In influenza -positive patients with chronic cardiac and/or respiratory disease, the combined incidence of lower respiratory tract complications (mainly bronchitis) treated with antibio tics was 17 % (22/133) in the placebo group and 14 % (16/11 8) in the oseltamivir treated populat ion (p = 0.597 6). Treatment of influenza in pregnant women: No controlled clinical studies have been conducted on the use of oseltamivir in pregnant women, however, there is evidence from post -marketing and retrospective observational studies showing benefit of the current dosing regimen in this patient population in terms of lower morbidity/mortality. Results from pharmacokinetic analyses indicate a lower exposure to the active metabolite, however dose adjustments are not recommended for pregn ant women in the treatment or prophylaxis of influenza (see section 5.2, Pharmacokinetics, Special Population). Treatment of influenza in children : In a study of otherwise healt hy children (65 % influenza -positive) aged 1 to 12 years (mean age 5.3 years) who had fever ( 37.8 \u00b0C) plus either cough or coryza, 67 % of influenza -positive patients were infected with influenza A and 33 % with influenza B. Oselta mivir treatment, started within 48 hours of onset of symptoms, signific antly reduced the time to freedom from illness (defined as the simultaneous return to normal health and activi ty and alleviation of fever, cough and coryza) by 1.5 days (95 % CI 0.6 - 2.2 days; p < 0.0001) compared to placebo. Oseltamivir reduced the incidence of acute otitis media from 26.5 % (53/200) in the placebo group to 16 % (29/1 83) in the oselta mivir treated children (p = 0.013). A second study was completed in 334 asthmatic childr en aged 6 to 12 years old of which 53.6 % were influenza -positive. In the oselta mivir treated group, the median duration of illness was not reduced significant ly. By day 6 (the last day of treatment) FEV1 had increased by 10.8 % in the oselt amivir treated group compared to 4.7 % on place bo (p = 0.0148) in this population. The European Medicines Agency has deferred the obligation to submit the results of studies with oseltamivir in one or more subsets of the paediat ric popul ation in influenza. See section 4.2 for infor mation on paediatric use. The indication in infants below the age of 1 is based upon extrapolation of efficacy data from older children and the recommended posology is based upon pharmacokinetic modelling data (see Section 5.2). Treatment of influenza B infection : Overall, 15 % of the influenza -positive population were infected by influenza B, proport ions ranging from 1 to 33 % in individual studies. The median duration of illness in influenza B infected subjects did not differ signif icantly between the treatment groups in indivi dual studies. Data from 504 influenza B infected subject s were pooled across all studies for analysis. Oseltamivir reduced the time to allevia tion of all symptoms by 0. 7 days (95 % CI 0.1 - 1.6 days; p = 0.022) and the durati on of fever ( 37.8 \u00b0C), cough and coryza by one day (95 % CI 0.4 - 1.7 days; p < 0.001) compared to placebo. Treatment of influenza in immunocompromised patients : A randomized, double blind study, to evaluate safety and characterize the effects of oseltamivir on the development of resistant influenza virus (primary analysis) in influenza -infected immunocompromised patients, included 151 adult patients , 7 adolescents and 9 children evaluable for efficacy of oseltamivir (secondary analysis, not powered). The study included solid organ transplant [SOT] patients, haematopoietic stem cell transplant [HSCT] patients, HIV positive patients with a CD4+ cell count <500 cells/ mm3, patients on systemic immunosuppressive therapy, and those with haematological malignancy. These patients were randomized to be treated, within 96 hours of symptoms onset, for a duration of 10 days. The treatment regimens were: standard dose ( 75 mg or weight adjusted dose for children) twice daily (73 adult patients , 4 adolescent patients and 4 children ) or double dose ( 150 mg or weight -adjusted dose for children) twice daily (78 adult patients , 3 adolescent patients and 5 children ) of oseltamivir. The median time to resolution of symptoms (TTRS) for adults and adolescents was similar between the standard dose group (103.4 hours [95 % CI 75.4 -122.7]) and double dose group ( 107.2 hours [95 % 15 CI 63.9-140.0 ]). The TTRS for children was variable and the interpretation is limited by the small sample size. The proportion of adult patients with secondary infections in the standard dose group and double dose group was comparable (8.2% vs 5.1%). For adolescents and ch ildren, only one patient (an adolescent) in the standard dose group experienced a secondary infection (bacterial sinusitis). A pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics study was conducted in severely immunocompromised children (12 years of age, n=30) receivi ng standard (75 mg or weight adjusted twice daily) vs. triple dose (225 mg or weight adjusted twice dai ly) oseltamivir for an adaptive dosing period of 5 to 20 days dependant on duration of viral shedding (mean treatment duration: 9 days) . No patients in the standard dose group and 2 patients in the triple dose group reported secondary bacterial infections (bronchit is and sinusitis) . Prevention of influenza The efficacy of oselta mivir in preventing natural ly occurring influenza illness has been demonstrated in a post-exposure prevention study in households and two seasonal prevention studies. The primary efficacy parameter for all of these studies was the incidence of laborator y-confi rmed influenza. The virulence of influenza epidemics is not predict able and varies within a region and from season to season, theref ore the number needed to treat (NNT) in order to prevent one case of influenza illness varies. Post-exposure preventio n: In a study in contacts (12.6 % vaccinat ed against influenza) of an index case of influenza, oselt amivir 75 mg once daily was started within 2 days of onset of symptoms in the index case and continued for seven days. Influe nza was confi rmed in 163 out of 377 index cases. Oseltamivir significantly reduced the incidence of clinical influenza illness occu rring in the contacts of confirmed influenza cases from 24/200 (12 %) in the placebo group to 2/205 (1 %) in the oselta mivir group (92 % reduction [95 % CI 6 - 16; p 0.0001]). The number needed to treat (NNT) in contacts of true influ enza cases was 10 (95 % CI 9 - 12) and was 16 (95 % CI 15 - 19) in the whole populatio n (ITT) regardless of infect ion status in the index case. The efficacy of oselta mivir in preventing natural ly occurring influenza illness has been demonstrated in a post-exposure prevention study in households that included adults, adolesce nts, and children aged 1 to 12 years, both as index cases and as family contacts. The primary efficacy parameter for this study was the incidence of laborator y-confirmed clinical influenza in the households. Oseltamivir proph ylaxis lasted for 10 days. In the total populati on, there was a reduction in the incidence of laborato ry-confirmed clinical influenza in households from 20 % (27 / 136) in the group not receiving prevention to 7 % (10 / 135) in the group receiving prevention (62.7 % reduction [95 % CI 26.0 - 81.2; p = 0.0042 ]). In households of influenza-infected index cases, there was a reduct ion in the incidence of influenza from 26 % (23 / 89) in the group not receiving prevention to 11 % (9 / 84) in the group receiving prevention (58.5 % reduction [95 % CI 15.6 - 79.6; p = 0.011 4]). According to subgrou p analysis in child ren at 1 to 12 years of age, the incidence of laborato ry-confirmed clinical influenza among children was significantly reduced from 19 % (21 / 111) in the group not receiving prevention to 7 % (7 / 104) in the group receiving prevention (64.4 % reduction [95 % CI 15.8 - 85.0; p = 0.0188 ]). Among children who were not already shedding virus at baseline, the incidence of laborato ry-confirmed clinical influenza was reduced from 21 % (15 / 70) in the group not receiving prevention to 4 % (2 / 47) in the group receiving prevention (80.1 % reduction [95 % CI 22.0 - 94.9; p 0.020 6]). The NNT for the total paediatric populat ion was 9 (95 % CI 7 - 24) and 8 (95 % CI 6, upper limit not estimable) in the whole populat ion (ITT) and in paediatric contacts of infected index cases (ITT II), respectivel y. Post-exposure prevention of influenza in infants less than 1 year of age during a pandemic: Prevention during an influenza pandemic has not been studied in controlled clinical studies in children 0-12 months of age. See Section 5.2 for exposure simulation details. Prevention during an influenza epidemic in the communit y: In a pooled analysis of two other studies conducted in unvaccinated otherwise healthy adults, oselta mivir 75 mg once daily given for 6 weeks significantly reduced the incidence of clinical influenza illness from 25 /519 (4.8 %) in the placebo group to 6/520 (1.2 %) in the oselta mivir group (76 % reduction [95 % CI 1.6 - 5.7; p = 0.0006]) 16 during a community outbreak of influe nza. The NNT in this study was 28 (95 % CI 24 - 50). A study in older people in nursing homes, where 80 % of participants recei ved vaccine in the season of the study, oseltamivir 75 mg once daily given for 6 weeks significantly reduced the incidence of clinical influenza illness from 12/272 (4.4 %) in the placebo group to 1/276 (0.4 %) in the oselta mivir group (92 % reduction [95 % CI 1.5 - 6.6; p = 0.0015] ). The NNT in this study was 25 (95 % CI 23 - 62). Prophylaxis of influenza in immunocompromised patients : A doubl e-blind, placebo -controlled, random ised study was conducted for seasonal proph ylaxis of influenza in 475 immunoc ompromised patients (388 patients with solid organ transplantation [195 placebo; 193 oselta mivir], 87 patients with transplantation [43 place bo; 44 oselta mivir], no patient with other immunosuppr essant conditions), includ ing 18 children 1 to 12 years of age. The primary endpoint in this study was the incidence of laborator y-confir med clinical influenza as determined by viral culture and/or a four-fold rise in HAI antibodies. The incide nce of laborator y-confirm ed clinical influenza was 2.9 % (7/238) in the placebo group and 2.1 % (5/237) in the oseltamivir group (95 % CI -2.3 % - 4.1 %; p = 0 .772). Specific studies have not been conducted to assess the reduction in the risk of complications. Oseltamivi r resistance Clinical studies: The risk of emergence of influenza viruses with reduced susceptibility or frank resistance to oselta mivir has been examined during Roche-sponsored clinical studies. Developing oseltamivir -resistant virus during treatment was more frequent in children than adults, ranging from less than 1% in adults to 18% in infants aged below 1 year. Children who were found to carry oseltamivir -resistant virus in general shed the virus for a prolonged period compared with subjects with susceptible virus. However treatment -emergent resistance to oseltamivir did not affect treatment response and caused no prolongation of influenza symptoms. An overall higher incidence of oseltamivir -resistance was observed in adult and adole scent immunocompromised patients treated with standard dose or double dose of oseltamivir for a duration of 10 days [14. 5% (10/6 9) in standard dose group and 2. 7% (2/7 4) in double dose group], compared to data from studies with oseltamivir -treated otherwise healthy adult and adolescent patients. The majority of adult patients that developed resistance were transplant recipients (8/10 patients in the standard dose group and 2/2 patients in the double dose group). Most of the patients with oseltamivir - resistant virus were infected with influenza type A and had prolonged viral shedding. The incidence of oseltamivir -resistance observed in immunocompromised children (12 years of age ) treated with oseltamivir across the two studies and evaluated for resistance was 20.7% (6/29). Of the six immunocompromised children found with treatment -emergent resistance to oseltamivir , 3 patients received standard dose and 3 patients high dose (double or triple dose). The majority had acute lymphoid leukemia and were 5 year s of age. Incidence of Oseltamivir Resistance in Clinical Studies Patient Population Patients with Resistance Mutations (%) Phenotyping* Geno - and Phenotyping* Adults and * Full geno typing was not performed in all studies. Prophylaxis of Influenza There has been no evidence for emergen ce of drug resistance associ ated with the use of oseltamivir in clinical studies conducted to date in post-exposure (7 days), post-exposure within household groups 17 (10 days) and seasonal (42 days) preven tion of influenza in immunoc ompetent patients. There was no resistance observed during a 12-week proph ylaxis study in immunoco mpromised patients. Clinical and surveillance data: Natural mutations associated with reduced susceptibilit y to oseltamivir in vitro have been detected in influenza A and B viruses isolated from patients without exposure to oselt amivir. Resist ant strains selected during oseltamivir treatment have been isolated from both immunoc ompetent and immunoc ompromised patients. Immunoco mpromised patients and young children are at a higher risk of developin g oselta mivir-resistant virus during treatment. Oseltamivir ry strains of influ enza viruses have to contain mutations in N1 and N2 neura minidases. Resistance mutations tend to be viral sub-type specific. Since 2007 naturally occurring resistance associat ed with the H275Y mutation in seasonal H1N1 strains has been sporadically detected . The susceptibili ty to oselt amivir and the prevalence of such viruses appear to vary seasonally and geographicall y. In 2008, H275Y was found in > 99 % of circulating H1N1 influenza isolates in Europe. The 2009 H1N1 influenza (\"swine flu\") was almost unifor mly susceptible to oseltamivir, with only sporadic reports of resistance in connection with both therapeutic and prophylactic regimens. 5.2 Pharmacokinetic properties General Information Absorption Oselt amivir is readily absorbed from the gastrointestinal tract after oral administr ation of oselt amivir phosphate to the active metabolite (oselta mivir carboxylate). At least 75 % of an oral dose reaches the systemic circulation as the active metabolite. Exposure to the pro-drug is less than 5 % relative to the active metabolite. Plasma concentrations of both pro-drug and active metabolite are proportional to dose and are unaffected by co-administration with food. Distribution The mean volume of distribution at steady state of the oselt amivir carbox ylate is approxi mately volume equivalent to extrace llular body carbox ylate distribu tes all sites spread. The bindi ng of the oseltamivir carbox esterases located predom inantly in liver. In vitro studies demonstrated that neither oselta mivir nor the active metabolite is a substrate for, or an inhibitor of, the major cytochrome P450 isoforms. No phase 2 conjugates of either compound have been identified in vivo. Elimination Absorbed oselta mivir is primarily (> 90 %) eliminated by conversion to oseltamivir carbo xylate. It is not further metabolised and is eliminated in the urine. Peak plasma concentrations of oselt amivir carbox ylate decline with a half-life of 6 to 10 hours in most subjects. The active metabolite is eliminated entirely by ren al excretion. Renal clearance (18.8 l/h) exceeds glomerular filtration rate (7.5 l/h) indicating that tubular secretion occurs in addition to glomerular filtration. Less than 20 % of an oral radiolabelled dose is eliminated in faeces. Other special popul ations Paediatric population 18 Infants less than 1 year of age : The pharmacokinetics, pharmacodynamics and safety of oseltamivir have been evaluated in two uncontrolled open-label studies including influenza infected children less than one year of age (n=135). The rate of clearance of t he active metabolite, corrected for body - weight, decreases with ages below one year. Metabolite exposures are also more variable in the youngest infants. The available data indicates that the exposure following a 3 mg/kg dose in infants 0 - 12 months of age provides pro-drug and metabolite exposures anticipated to be efficacious with a safety profile comparable to that seen in older children and adults using the approved dose (see sections 4.1 and 4.2). The reported adverse events were consistent with the established safety profile in older children. There are no data available for infants below 1 year of age for post exposure prevention of influenza. Prevention during an influenza epidemic in the community has not been studied in children below 12 years of age. Post-exposure prevention of influenza in infants less than 1 year of age during a pandemic: Simulation of once daily dosing of 3mg/kg in infants <1 year shows an exposure in the same range or higher than for once daily dosing of 75 mg in adults. Exposure does not exceed that for treatment of infants < 1 year (3 mg/kg twice daily) and is anticipated to result in a comparable safety profile (see Section 4.8). No clinical studies of prophylaxis in infants aged <1 have been performed. Infants and children 1 year of age or older: The pharmacokinetics of oselta mivir have been evaluated in single -dose pharmacokinetic studies in infants, children and adolescents 1 to 16 years of age. Multiple -dose pharmacok inetics were studied in a small number of children enrolled in a clinical efficacy study. Younger children cleared both the pro-drug and its active metabolite faster than adults, resulting in a lower exposure for a given mg/kg dose. Doses of 2 mg/kg give oselta mivir carboxylate exposures comparable to those achieved in adults receiving a single 75 mg dose (approxi mately 1 mg/kg). The pharmacok inetics of oselt amivir in children and adolescents 12 years of age or older are similar to those in adults. Elderly Exposure to the active metabolite at steady state was 25 to 35 % higher in older people (age 65 to 78 years) co mpared to adults less than 65 years of age given comparable doses of oselt amivir. Half-lives observed in older people were similar to those seen in young adults. On the basis of drug expos ure and tolerabilit y, dosage adjustments are not required for older people unless there is evidence of moderate or severe renal impairment (creatini ne clearance below 60 ml /min) (see section 4.2). Renal impai rment Administration of 100 mg oselta mivir phosphate twice daily for 5 days to patie nts with vario us degrees of renal impairment showed that exposure to oselta mivir carbox ylate is inversely proportional to declining renal function. For dosing, see section 4.2. Hepatic impairment In vitro studies have concluded that exposure to oseltamivir is not expected to be increas ed significant ly nor is exposure to the active metabolite expected to be significantly decreased in patients with hepatic impairment (see section 4.2). Pregnant Women A pooled population pharmacokinetic analysis indicates that the Ebilfumin dosage regimen described in Section 4.2 Posology and method of administration results in lower exposure (30% on average across all trimesters) to the active metabolite in pregnant women compared to non-pregnant women. The lower predicted exposure however, remains above inhibitory concentrations (IC95 values) and at a therapeutic level for a range of influenza virus strains. In addition, there is evidence from observational studies showing benefit of the current dosing regimen in this patient population. Therefore, dose adjustments are not recommended for pregnant women in the treatment or prophylaxis of influenza (see section 4.6 Fertility, pregnancy and lactation). 19 Immunocomprom ised Patients Population pharmacokinetic analys es indicate that treatment of adult and paediatric (<18 years old) immunocompromised patients with oseltamivir (as described in Section 4.2. Posology and method of administration) results in an increased predi cted exposure ( from approximately 5% up to 50%) to the active metabolite when compared to non -immunocompromised patients with comparable creatinine clearance. Due to the wide safety margin of the active metabolite, no dose adjustments are required in patients due to their immunocompromised status. However, for immunocompromised patients with renal impairment, doses should be adjusted as outlined in section 4.2. Posology and method of administration. Pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic analyses from t wo studies in immunocompromised patients indicated that there was no meaningful additional benefit in exposures higher than those achieved after the administration of the standard dose. 5.3 Preclinical safety data Preclinical data reveal no special hazard for humans based on conventional studies of safety pharmacology, repeated -dose toxicity and genotoxicity. Results of the conventional rodent carcinogenicity studies showed a trend towards a dose-dependent increase in the incidence of some tumours that are typical for the rodent strains used. Considering the margins of exposure in relation to the expected exposure in the human use, these findings do not change the benefit -risk of o seltamivir in its adopted therapeuti c indications. Teratology studies have been conducted in rats and rabbits at doses of up to 1,500 mg/kg/day and 500 mg/kg/day, respectively. No effects on foetal development were observed. A rat fertil ity study up to a dose of 1,500 mg/kg/day demonstrated no adverse reactions on either sex. In pre- and post -natal rat studies, prolonged parturition was noted at 1,500 mg/kg/day: the safety margin between human exposure and the highest no-effect dose (500 mg/kg/day) in rats is 480 -fold for oseltamivir and 44-fold for the active metabolite, respectively. Foetal exposure in the rats and rabbits was approximately 15 to 20 % of that of the mother. In lactating rats, oseltamivir and the active metabolite are excreted in the milk. Limited data indicate that oseltamivir and the active metabolite are excreted in human milk. Extrapolation of the animal data provides estimates of 0.01 mg/day and 0.3 mg/day for the respective compounds. A potential for skin sensitisation to oseltamivir was observed in a \"maximisation\" test in guinea pigs. Approximately 50 % of the animals treated with the unformulated active substance showed erythema after challenging the induced animals. Reversible irritancy of rabbits' eyes was detected. Whereas very high oral single doses of o seltamivir phosphate salt, up to the highest dose tested (1,310 mg/kg), had no adverse reactions in adult rats, such doses resulted in toxicity in juvenile 7-day - old rat pups, including death. These reac tions were seen at doses of 657 mg/kg and higher. At 500 mg/kg, no adverse reactions were seen, includ ing upon chronic treatment (500 mg/kg/day administered from 7 to 21 days post partum). 6.

Extemporaneous formulation When oseltamivir powder for oral suspension is not available Commercially manufactured oseltamivir powder for oral suspension (6 mg/ml) is the preferred product for paediatric and adult patients who have diffic ulties swallowing capsules or where lower doses are needed. In the event that commercially manufactured oseltamivir powder for oral suspension is not available, the pharmacist may compound a suspension (6 mg/ml) from Ebilfumin capsules or patients can prepare the suspension from capsules at home. The pharmacy preparation shoul d be preferred to home preparation. Detailed information on the home preparation can be found in the package leaflet of Ebilfumin capsules under \"Maki ng liquid Ebilfumin at home\". Syringes of appropriate volume and grading should be provided for administering the pharmacy compounded suspension as well as for the procedures involved in the home preparation. In both cases, the correct volumes should preferably be marked on the syringes. Pharmacy compounding Pharmacy compounded 6 mg/ml suspension prep ared from capsules Adults, adolescents and infants and children 1 year of age or older who are unable to swallow intact capsules 22 This procedure describes the preparation of a 6 mg/ml suspension that will provide one patient with enough medicine for a 5-day course of treatment or a 10-day course of prophylaxis. For immunocompromised patients, a 10-day course of treatment is needed. The pharmacist may compound a 6 mg/ml suspension from Ebilfumin 30 mg, 45 mg or 75 mg capsules using water containing 0.05 % w/v sodium benz oate added as a preservative. First, calculate the total volume needed to be compounded and dispensed to provide a 5-day course of treatment or a 10-day course of prophylaxis for the patient.

Third, follow the procedure below for compounding the 6 mg/ml suspension from Ebilfumin capsules: 24 1. In a glass beaker of suitable size place the stated amount of water containing 0.05 % w/v sodium benzoate added as a preservative. 2. Open the stated amount of Ebilfumin capsules and transfer the content of each capsule directly to the preserved water in the glass beaker. 3. With a suitable stirring device, stir for 2 minutes. (Note: The drug substance, oseltamivir phosphate, readily dissolves in water. The suspension is caused by some of the excipients of Ebilfumin capsules, which are insoluble.) 4. Transfer the suspension t o an amber glass or amber polyethyleneterephthalate (PET) bottle. A funnel may be used to eliminate any spillage. 5. Close the bottle using a child-resistant cap. 6. Put an ancillary label on the bottle indicating \"Shake Gently Before Use\". (Note: This co mpounded suspension should be gently shaken prior to administration to minimi se the tendency for air entrapment.) 7. Instruct the parent or caregiver that any remaining material following completion of therapy must be discarded. It is recommended that this information be provided by either affixing an ancillary label to the bottle or adding a statement to the pharmacy label instructions. 8. Place an appropriate expiration date label according to storage condition (see section 6.3). Place a pharmacy label on the bottle that includes the patient 's name, dosing instructions, use by date, name of medicinal product and any other required information to be in compliance with local pharmacy regulations .

Third, follow the procedure below for compounding the 6 mg/ml suspension from Ebilfumin capsules: 1. In a glass beaker of suitable size place the stated amount of water containing 0.05 % w/v sodium benzoate added as a preservative. 2. Open the stated amount of Ebilfumin capsules and transfer the content of each capsule directly to the preserved water in the glass beaker. 3. With a suitable stirring device, stir for 2 minutes. (Note: The drug substance, oseltamivir phosphate, readily dissolves in water. The suspension is caused by some of the excipients of Ebilfumin capsules, which are insoluble.) 4. Transfer the suspension to an amber glass or amber polyethyleneterephthalate (PET) bottle. A funnel may be used to eliminate any spillage. 5. Close the bottle using a child-resistant cap. 6. Put an ancillary label on the bottle indicating \"Shake Gently Before Use\". (Note: This compounded suspension should be gently shaken prior to administration to minimi se the tendency for air entrapment.) 7. Instruct the parent or caregiver that any remaining material following completion of therapy must be discarded. It is recommended that this information be provided by either affixing an ancillary label to the bottle or adding a statement to the pharmacy label instructions. 8. Place an appropriate expiration date label according to storage condition (see section 6.3).

If possible, mark or highlight the graduati on correspondi ng to the appropriate dose (according to the dosing tables above) on the oral syringe for each patient. The appropriate dose must be mixed by the caregiver with an equal quanti ty of sweet liquid food, such as sugar wate r, chocolate syrup, cherry syrup, dessert toppings (like caramel or fudge sauce) to mask the bitter taste. Home prepa ration When commercially manufactured oseltamivir powder for oral suspension is not available, a pharmacy compounded suspension prepared from Ebilfumin capsules must be used (see detai led instructions above). If the commercially manufactured oseltamivir powder for oral suspension and the pharmacy compounded suspension is also not availab le, Ebilfumin suspension may be prepared at home. When appropriate capsule strengths are available for the dose needed, the dose is given by opening the capsule and mixing its contents with no more than one teaspoon of a suitable sweetened food product. The bitter taste can be masked by products such as sugar water, chocolate syrup, cherry syrup, dessert toppi ngs (like caramel or fudge sauce). The mixture should be stirred and given entirely to the patient. The mixture must be swallowed immed iately after its preparation. When only 75 mg capsul es are availab le, and doses of 30 mg or 45 mg are needed, the preparation of Ebilfumin suspension involves additional steps.

What you need to know before you take Ebilfumin 3. How to take Ebilfumin 4. Possible side effects 5. How to store Ebilfumin 6. Contents of the pack and other information 1. What Ebilfumin is and what it is used for Ebilfumin is used for adults, adolescents, children and infants (including full -term newborn babies) for treating flu (influenza ). It can be used when you have flu symptoms, and the flu virus is known to be going round in your community. Ebilfumin can also be prescribed for adults, adolescents, children and infants above 1 year of age for preventing flu, on a case-b y-case basis - for instance, if you have been in contact with someone who has flu. Ebilfumin may be prescribed for adults, adolescents, children and infants (including full -term newborn babies) as preventive treatment in exceptional circumstances - for example, if there is a global epidemic of flu (a flu pandemic ) and the seasonal flu vaccine may not provide sufficient protection. Ebilfumin contains oselta mivir, which belongs to a group of medicines named neuraminidase inhibi tors. These medicines prevent the flu virus from spreading inside the body. They help to ease or prevent the symptoms of the flu virus infection. Influenza, usually called flu, is an infection caused by a virus. The signs of flu often include a sudden fever (more than 37.8 \u00b0C), cough, runny or stuffy nose, headaches, muscle aches and extr eme tiredness. These symptoms can also be cause d by other infections. True influenza infection only occurs during annual outbreaks (epide mics) when flu viruses are spreading in the local community. Outside epide mic periods, flu-like symptoms are usually cause d by a different type of illness. 2. What you need to know before you take Ebilfumin Do not take Ebilfumin: if you are allergic to oselta mivir or any of the other ingredients of this medicine (listed in section 6). Talk to your doctor if this applies to you. Do not take Ebilfumin. 44 Warnings and precautions Talk to your doctor or pharmacist before taking Ebilfumin . Before you take Ebilfumin , make sure the prescribing doctor knows if you are allergic to other medicines if you have problems with your kidneys. If so, your dose may need adjustment if you have a severe medical condition, which may require immed iate hospitalisation if your immune system is not worki ng if you have chronic heart disea se or respiratory disea se. During treatment with Ebilfumin , tell a doctor immediately : if you notice changes in behaviour or mood (neuropsychiatric events), especial ly in children and adolescents. These may be signs of rare but serious side effects. Ebilfumin is not a flu vaccine Ebilfumin is not a vaccine: it treats infect ion, or prevents the flu virus spreading. A vaccine gives you antibodies against the virus. Ebilfumin will not change the effective ness of a flu vaccine, and you might be prescribed both by your doctor. Other medicines and Ebilfumin Tell your doctor or pharmacist if you are taking , have recent ly taken or might take any other medicines. This includes medicines obtained without a prescription. The following medicines are particularly important: chlorpropa mide (used to treat diabetes) methotrexate (used to treat e.g. rheumatoid arthritis) phenylbutazone (used to treat pain and inflammation) probenecid (used to treat gout) Pregnancy and breast -feeding You must tell your doctor if you are pregnant, if you think you are pregnant or if you are trying to get pregnant so that your doctor can decide if Ebilfumin is right for you. The effects on breast -fed infants are unknown. You must tell your doctor if you are breast -feeding so that your doctor can decide if Ebilfumin is right for you. Ask your doctor or pharmacist for advice before taking this medicine. Driving and using machines Ebilfumin has no effect on your abilit y to drive or use machines.

This pharmacy preparation is the preferred option. If the pharmacy preparation is not available eit her, y ou can make Ebilfumin suspension from these capsules at home. The dose is the same for treating or preventing flu. The difference is how often it is given. Making Liquid Ebilfumin at home If you have the right capsule for the dose needed (a 30 mg or a 60 mg dose), you will open the capsule and stir its contents into one teaspoon (or less) of a suitable sweetened food product. This is usually suitable for children over 1 year. See the upper set of instructions. If you need smaller doses, making Ebilfumin suspension from capsules involves extra steps. This is suitable for younger children and babies: they usually need an Ebilfumin dose of less than 30 mg. See the lower set of instructions. Children 1 to 12 years To make a 30 mg or a 60 mg dose, you need: One or two 30 mg Ebilfumin capsule(s) Sharp scissors One small bowl Teaspoon (5 ml spoon) Water Sweet food to hide the bitter taste of the powder. Examples are: chocolate or c herry syrup, and dessert toppings such as caramel or fudge sauce. Or you can make sugar water: mix a teaspoon of water with three-quarters (3/4) of a teaspoon of sugar. Step 1: Check the dose is correct To find the correct amount to use, find the patient's weight on the left of the table. Look at the right column to check the number of capsules you will need to give the patient for a single dose. The amount is the same whether treating or preventing flu. You should use only 30 mg capsules for 30 mg and 60 mg doses. Do not try to make a 45 mg or 75 mg dose by using the contents of 30 mg capsules. Use the appropriate size capsule instead. Weight Dose of Ebilfumin Number of capsules Up to 15 kg 30 mg 1 capsule 15 kg up to 23 kg 45 mg Do not use 30 mg capsules 23 kg up to 40 kg 60 mg 2 capsules Step 2: Pour all the powder into a bowl 52 Hold a 30 mg capsule upright over a bowl and carefully snip off the rounded tip with scissors. Pour all of the powder into the bowl. Open a second capsule for a 60 mg dose. Pour all of the powder into the bowl. Be careful with the powder, because it may irritate your skin and eyes. Step 3: Sweeten the powder and give the dose Add a small amount - no more than one teaspoonful - of sweet food to the powder in the bowl. This is to hide the bitter taste of the Ebilfumin powder. Stir the mixture well. Give the whole contents of the bowl to the patient straight away. If there is some mixture left in the bowl, rinse the bowl with a small amount of water and get the patient to drink it all. Repeat this procedure every time you need to give the medicine. Infants less than 1 year To make a smaller single dose, you need: One 30 mg Ebilfumin capsule Sharp scissors Two small bowls (use separate pairs of bowls for each child) One large oral dose dispenser to measure out water - a 5 or 10 ml dispenser One small oral dose dispenser showing measurements of 0.1 ml, to give the dose Teaspoon (5 ml spoon) Water Sweet food to hide the bitter taste of the Ebilfumin . Examples are: chocolate or c herry syrup and dessert toppings such as caramel or fudge sauce. Or you can make sugar water: mix a teaspoon of water with three-quarters (3/4) of a teaspoon of sugar. Step 1: Pour all the powder into a bowl 53 Hold a 30 mg capsule upright over one of the bowls and carefully snip off the rounded tip with scissors. Be careful with the powder: it may irritate your skin and eyes. Pour all of the powder into the bowl, whatever the dose you are making. The amount is the same whether you are treating or preventing flu. Step 2: Add water to dilute the medicine Use the larger dispenser to draw up 5 ml water. Add the water to the powder in the bowl. Stir the mixture with the teaspoon for about 2 minutes. Don't worry if not all of the powder dissolves. The undissolved powder is just inactive ingredients. Step 3: Choose the correct amount for your child's weight Look up the child's weight on the left side of the table. The column on the right of the table shows how much of the liquid mixture you will need to draw up.

What you need to know before you take Ebilfumin 3. How to take Ebilfumin 4. Possible side effects 5. How to store Ebilfumin 6. Contents of the pack and other information 1. What Ebilfumin is and what it is used for Ebilfumin is used for adults, adolescents, children and infants (including full -term newborn babies) for treating flu (influenza ). It can be used when you have flu symptoms, and the flu virus is known to be going round in your community. Ebilfumin can also be prescribed for adults, adolescents, children and infants above 1 year of age for preventing flu, on a case-b y-case basis - for instance, if you have been in contact with someone who has flu. Ebilfumin may be prescribed for adults, adolescents, children and infants (including full -term newborn babies) as preventive treatment in exceptional circumstances - for example, if there is a global epidemic of flu (a flu pandemic ) and the seasonal flu vaccine may not provide sufficient protection. Ebilfumin contains oselta mivir, which belongs to a group of medicines named neuraminidase inhibi tors. These medicines prevent the flu virus from spreading inside the body. They help to ease or prevent the symptoms of the flu virus infection. Influenza, usually called flu, is an infection caused by a virus. The signs of flu often include a sudden fever (more than 37.8 \u00b0C), cough, runny or stuffy nose, headaches, muscle aches and extr eme tiredness. These symptoms can also be cause d by other infections. True influenza infection only occurs during annual outbreaks (epide mics) when flu viruses are spreading in the local community. Outside epide mic periods, flu-like symptoms are usually cause d by a different type of illness. 2.

During treatment with Ebilfumin , tell a doctor immediately : if you notice changes in behaviour or mood (neuropsychiatric events), especial ly in children and adolescents. These may be signs of rare but serious side effects. Ebilfumin is not a flu vaccine Ebilfumin is not a vaccine: it treats infect ion, or prevents the flu virus spreading. A vaccine gives you antibodies against the virus. Ebilfumin will not change the effective ness of a flu vaccine, and you might be prescribed both by your doctor. Other medicines and Ebilfumin Tell your doctor or pharmacist if you are taking , have recent ly taken or might take any other medicines. This includes medicines obtained without a prescription.

Ebilfumin may be prescribed for adults, adolescents, children and infants (including full -term newborn babies) as preventive treatment in exceptional circumstances - for example, if there is a global epidemic of flu (a flu pandemic ) and the seasonal flu vaccine may not provide sufficient protection. Ebilfumin contains oselta mivir, which belongs to a group of medicines named neuraminidase inhibi tors. These medicines prevent the flu virus from spreading inside the body. They help to ease or prevent the symptoms of the flu virus infection. Influenza, usually called flu, is an infection caused by a virus. The signs of flu often include a sudden fever (more than 37.8 \u00b0C), cough, runny or stuffy nose, headaches, muscle aches and extr eme tiredness. These symptoms can also be cause d by other infections. True influenza infection only occurs during annual outbreaks (epide mics) when flu viruses are spreading in the local community. Outside epide mic periods, flu-like symptoms are usually cause d by a different type of illness. 2.

Detailed information on this medicine is available on the European Medicines Agency web site: http://www.ema.europa.eu 77 --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Information for the user For people who find it hard to take capsules, includi ng very young children, a liquid medicine may be available. If you need a liquid medicine, but it's not available, a suspension can be made up at the pharmacy from Ebilfumin capsules (see Information for healthcare professionals). This pharmacy preparation is the preferred option. If the pharmacy preparation is not available eit her, you can make Ebilfumin suspension from these capsules at home. The dose is the same for treating or preventing flu. The difference is how often it is given. Making Liquid Ebilfumin at home If you have the right capsule strength for the dose needed (a 75 mg dose), you will open the capsule and stir its contents into one teaspoon (or less) of a suitable sweetened food product. This is usually suitable for children over 1 year. See the upper set of instructions. If you need smaller doses, making Ebilfu min suspension from capsules involves extra steps. This is suitable for younger children and babies: they usually need an Ebilfumin dose of less than 30 mg. See the lower set of instructions. Adults, adolescents 13 years and over, and children weighing 40 kg and over To make a 75 mg dose, you need: One 75 mg Ebilfumin capsule Sharp scissors One small bowl Teaspoon (5 ml spoon) Water Sweet food to hide the bitter taste of the powder. Examples are: chocolate or c herry syrup, and dessert toppings such as caramel or fudge sauce. Or you can make sugar water: mix a teaspoon of water with three-quarters (3/4) of a teaspoon of sugar. Step 1: Check the dose is correct To find the correct amount to use, find the patient's weight on the left of the table. Look at the right column to check the number of capsules you will need to give the patient for a single dose. The amount is the same whether treating or preventing flu. You should use only 75 mg capsules for 75 mg doses. Do not try to m ake a 75 mg dose by using the contents of 30 mg or 45 mg capsu les. Weight Dose of Ebilfumin Number of capsules 40 kg and over 75 mg 1 capsule Not for children who weigh less than 40 kg 78 You will need to prepare a dose of less than 75 mg for children who weigh less than 40 kg. See below. Step 2: Pour all the powder into a bowl Hold a 75 mg capsule upright over a bowl and carefully snip off the rounded tip with scissors. Pour all of the powder into the bowl. Be careful with the powder, because it may irritate your skin and eyes. Step 3: Sweeten the powder and give the dose Add a small amount - no more than one teaspoonful - of sweet food to the powder in the bowl. This is to hide the bitter taste of the Ebilfumin powder. Stir the mixture well. Give the whole contents of the bowl to the patient straight away. If there is some mixture left in the bowl, rinse the bowl with a small amount of water and get the patient to drink it all. Repeat this procedure every time you need to give the medicine. Infants less than 1 year, and children weighing less than 40 kg To make a smaller single dose, you need: One 75 mg Ebilfumin capsule Sharp scissors Two small bowls One large oral dose dispenser to measure out water - a 5 or 10 ml dispenser One small oral dose dispenser showing measurements of 0.1 ml, to give the dose Teaspoon (5 ml spoon) Water Sweet food to hide the bitter taste of the Ebilfumin . Examp les are: chocolate or c herry syrup and dessert toppings such as caramel or fudge sauce. 79 Or you can make sugar water: mix a teaspoon of water with three-quarters (3/4) of a teaspoon of sugar. Step 1: Pour all the powder into a bowl Hold a 75 mg capsule upright over one of the bowls and carefully snip off the rounded tip with scissors. Be careful with the powder: it may irritate your skin and eyes. Pour all of the powder into the bowl, whatever the dose you are making. The amount is the same whether you are treating or preventing flu. Step 2: Add water to dilute the medicine Use the larger dispenser to draw up 12.5 ml water. Add the water to the powder in the bowl. Stir the mixture with the teaspoon for about 2 minutes. Don't worry if not all of the powder dissolves. The undissolved powder is just inactive ingredients. Step 3: Choose the correct amount for your child's weight Look up the child's weight on the left side of the table. The column on the right of the table shows how much of the liquid mixture you will need to draw up. Infants less than 1 year (including full -term newborn babies) Child's weight (nearest) How much mixture to draw up 3 kg 1.5 ml 3.5 kg 1.8 ml 4 kg 2.0 ml 4.5 kg 2.3 ml 5 kg 2.5 ml 5.5 kg 2.8 ml 6 kg 3.0 ml 80 6.5 kg 3.3 ml 7 kg 3.5 ml 7.5 kg 3.8 ml 8 kg 4.0 ml 8.5 kg 4.3 ml 9 kg 4.5 ml 9.5 kg 4.8 ml 10 kg or more 5.0 ml Children 1 year or older, weighing less than 40 kg Child's weight (nearest) How much mixture to draw up Up to 15 kg 5.0 ml 15 to 23 kg 7.5 ml 23 to 40 kg 10.0 ml Step 4: Draw up the liquid mixture Make sure you have the right size dispenser.

Repeat this procedure ev ery time you need to give the medicine. 82 --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Information for healthcare professionals only Patients who are unable to swallow capsules: Commercially manufactured oseltamivir powder for oral suspension (6 mg/ml) is the preferred product for paediatric and adult patients who have difficulties swallowing capsules or where lower doses are needed.

If the pharmacy compounded suspension is also not available, patients may prepare the suspension from capsules at home. Oral dose dispensers (oral syringes) of appropriate volum e and grading should be provided for administering the pharmacy compounded suspension, and for the procedures involved in the home preparation. In both cases, the correct volumes should preferably be marked on the dispensers.
