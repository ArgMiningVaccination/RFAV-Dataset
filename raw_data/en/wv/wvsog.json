[[1]](#cite_note-Nichols2016-1) Among psychedelics, it is known for its unique ability to produce short-lived but intense [visionary states and complete hallucinations](/wiki/Hallucinatory_states). It is thought to produce its effects by binding to [serotonin](/wiki/Serotonin) [receptors](/wiki/Receptors) in the brain, although the precise mechanism is not fully understood. DMT is present in over 65 species of plants and has been identified as being a normal constituent of human metabolism and an endogenous [neurotransmitter](/wiki/Neurotransmitter) in certain rodents. Its presence is also known to be widespread throughout the plant kingdom. [[2]](#cite_note-ott1994-2) [[3]](#cite_note-TiHKAL-3) Although various theories have been postulated, its neurobiological function has yet to be When [vaporized](/wiki/Vaporized) or [smoked](/wiki/Smoked), DMT produces short-lived effects with a very rapid onset that is sometimes described as an \"inconceivably high-speed rollercoaster ride.\" When ingested in combination with a [MAOI](/wiki/MAOI) or [RIMA](/wiki/RIMA) agent, it becomes active [orally](/wiki/Oral) and significantly longer lasting, immersive, and interactive in nature: this combination is known as [ayahuasca](/wiki/Ayahuasca). [[4]](#cite_note-4) Ayahuasca brews have been used traditionally in South America since at least around the year 1500. [[5]](#cite_note-5) Unlike most highly prohibited substances, DMT has not been proven to be addictive or physiologically toxic. [[1]](#cite_note-Nichols2016-1) [[6]](#cite_note-6) However, adverse reactions such as severe [anxiety](/wiki/Anxiety), [delusions](/wiki/Delusions) and [psychosis](/wiki/Psychosis) are always possible, even for experienced users, and particularly for those predisposed to mental disorders. [[7]](#cite_note-7) It is highly advised to use [harm reduction practices](/wiki/Harm_reduction#Hallucinogens) if using this substance. History and culture DMT was first synthesized in 1931 by the German chemist Richard Helmuth Fredrick Manske. [[9]](#cite_note-Manske_R.H.F._1931_592.E2.80.93600-9) [[10]](#cite_note-bdmxab-10) Its discovery as a natural product is generally credited to Brazilian chemist and microbiologist Oswaldo Gon\u00e7alves de Lima who, in 1946, isolated an alkaloid he named nigerina (nigerine) It was unequivocally identified in 1959, when American chemists were provided a sample of Mimosa tenuiflora. [[12]](#cite_note-ott1996-12) [[13]](#cite_note-13) In 1955, a team of American chemists led by Evan Horning isolated and formally identified DMT in the seeds and pods of [Anadenanthera peregrina](/wiki/Anadenanthera_peregrina). [[12]](#cite_note-ott1996-12) [[14]](#cite_note-14) Since 1955, the substance has been found in a host of organisms: in at least fifty plant species belonging to ten families, [[2]](#cite_note-ott1994-2) and in at least four animal species, including one gorgonian [[15]](#cite_note-ReferenceA-15) and three mammalian species. Chemistry DMT, or N,N-dimethyltryptamine, is a member of a family of organic compounds known as [tryptamines](/wiki/Tryptamines). Tryptamines share a core structure consisting of a bicyclic indole heterocycle attached at R3 to an amino group via an ethyl side chain. DMT contains two methyl groups (CH3-) bound to the terminal amine RN at the end of this chain. It has many homologs and analogs from base tryptamines like [MET](/wiki/MET) and [DPT](/wiki/DPT), to four and five Pure DMT is a white, crystalline solid that is often described as smelling like rubber. It is moderately soluble in water, but soluble in organic solvents and aqueous acids. [[16]](#cite_note-16) Pharmacology [Serotonergic psychedelic](/wiki/Serotonergic_psychedelic) DMT's [psychedelic](/wiki/Psychedelic) effects are to come from its efficacy at the [5-HT2A receptor](/wiki/Serotonin#The_5-HT_system) as a [partial agonist](/wiki/Agonist#Agonists). However, the role of these interactions and how they result in the [psychedelic](/wiki/Psychedelic) experience continues to remain elusive. In addition to this, N,N-dimethyltryptamine is believed to be an endogenous ligand for the sigma receptor. However, the significance of the sigma-1 receptor remains the subject of ongoing scientific research. [[17]](#cite_note-17) Subjective effects Depending on the dosage and [method of administration](/wiki/Routes_of_administration), the effects of DMT can range from mild [psychedelic](/wiki/Psychedelic) states to powerfully immersive life-altering experiences which are often described as the ultimate displacement from ordinary consciousness in which users report experiencing ineffable spiritual realms or alternate dimensions. It's also commonly reported to encounter 'beings' of unknown origin after consuming a high dose of [DMT](https://psychedelia.io). Terrence Mckenna and Dr. Rick Strassman have both studied and popularized this phenomenon. [[18]](#cite_note-18) DMT in its smokeable form is reported to be the least mentally inebriating [psychedelic](/wiki/Psychedelic). It is due to a lack of perceived intoxication that many people describe DMT as a genuine experience that is actually happening to them. It is worth noting that many people report that smoked DMT is extremely clear-headed in its style and tends to produce less personal insight in comparison to orally active [psychedelics](/wiki/Psychedelics) such as [ayahuasca](/wiki/Ayahuasca), [LSD](/wiki/LSD) and [psilocybin](/wiki/Psilocybin) due to its short-acting nature. Disclaimer: The effects listed below cite the [Subjective Effect Index](/wiki/Subjective_effect_index) (SEI), an open research literature based on anecdotal user reports and the personal analyses of [PsychonautWiki](/wiki/PsychonautWiki) [contributors](/wiki/Special:TopUsers). As a result, they should be viewed with a healthy degree of skepticism. It is also worth noting that these effects will not necessarily occur in a predictable or reliable manner, although higher doses are more liable to induce the full spectrum of effects. Likewise, adverse effects become increasingly likely with higher doses and may include addiction, severe injury, or death . Physical effects - [Neurogenesis](/wiki/Neurogenesis) [[19]](#cite_note-pmid.3D32989216-19) [Spontaneous bodily sensations](/wiki/Spontaneous_bodily_sensations)- The \"body high\" of DMT can be described as a pleasurable all-encompassing glow. It maintains a consistent presence that quickly rises with the onset and hits its limit once the peak has been reached. It is capable of becoming very powerful at higher doses and can remain for up to half an hour after the experience itself has ended. [Physical euphoria](/wiki/Physical_euphoria)- It should be noted that this effect is not as reliably produced as it is with substances like [stimulants](/wiki/Stimulants)or [entactogens](/wiki/Entactogens), and can just as easily manifest as physical discomfort for no apparent reason. [Changes in felt gravity](/wiki/Changes_in_felt_gravity)- At higher breakthrough doses, physical feelings of being launched across vast distances at incredibly high speeds are commonly reported. [[11]](#cite_note-strassman-11) [Spatial [Nausea](/wiki/Nausea)- This effect is much less common than it is with [5-MeO-DMT](/wiki/5-MeO-DMT)as well as longer-lasting psychedelics like [psilocybin mushrooms](/wiki/Psilocybin#Psilocybin-containing_mushrooms)or [mescaline](/wiki/Mescaline). However, it can still manifest spontaneously and sometimes lead to sudden bouts of vomiting. [Pupil This is a very rare effect but is believed to happen in those who are predisposed to them, especially while in physically taxing conditions such as being dehydrated, fatigued or undernourished. - Visual effects - Enhancements Distortions [Drifting](/wiki/Drifting)( [melting](/wiki/Drifting#Melting), [breathing](/wiki/Drifting#Breathing), [morphing](/wiki/Drifting#Morphing)and [flowing](/wiki/Drifting#Flowing)) - In comparison to other [psychedelics](/wiki/Psychedelic), this effect can be described as highly detailed, slow and smooth in motion and static in its visual geometry encountered can be described as more similar in appearance to that of [psilocin](/wiki/Psilocin)than [LSD](/wiki/LSD). It can be comprehensively described through its [variations](/wiki/Geometry#Variations)as intricate in complexity, abstract in form, equally organic and digital in feel, structured in organization, brightly lit, multicoloured in scheme, glossy in shading, equal in sharp and soft edges, large in size, fast in speed, smooth in motion, equal in rounded and angular corners, immersive in depth and consistent in its intensity. At higher doses, it is significantly more likely to result in states of [level 8B](/wiki/8B_Geometry)visual geometry over [level 8A](/wiki/8A_Geometry). The geometry present with smokeable DMT is considered by many to be the most profoundly intricate and complex set of visual geometry found within the entirety of the [psychedelic](/wiki/Psychedelic)experience. In comparison to orally active DMT ( [ayahuasca](/wiki/Ayahuasca)), it is significantly more digital in appearance and contains a colour scheme which is similar to [LSD](/wiki/LSD)and a structured style that resembles a high dose of [psilocin](/wiki/Psilocin)(4-HO-DMT). Hallucinatory states DMT produces a full range of high level hallucinatory states in a fashion that is more consistent and reproducible than that of any other commonly used DMT produces high level internal hallucinations at appropriate doses more consistently than that of any other [psychedelic](/wiki/Psychedelic). They are more common within dark environments and can be comprehensively described through their [variations](/wiki/Internal_hallucinations#Variations)as lucid in believability, interactive in style, new experiences in content, autonomous in controllability, geometry-based in style and almost exclusively of a personal, religious, spiritual, science-fiction, fantasy, surreal, nonsensical or transcendental nature in their - These are more common within dark environments and can be comprehensively described through their [variations](/wiki/External_hallucinations#Variations)as lucid in believability, interactive in style, new experiences in content, autonomous in controllability, geometry-based in style and almost exclusively of a personal, religious, spiritual, science-fiction, fantasy, surreal, nonsensical or transcendental nature in their overall theme. - Cognitive itself acutely for all classical psychedelics when one to three doses are combined with a psychotherapy treatment program. When comparing meta analyses, psychedelic psychotherapy greatly outperforms \"gold standard\" treatments for several mental problems. of impending doom](/wiki/Feelings_of_impending_doom) [[11]](#cite_note-strassman-11) [Increased music appreciation](/wiki/Increased_music_appreciation)- This typically occurs only at lower sub-breakthrough doses, and is not as prominent of an effect as it is with longer lasting psychedelics like [LSD](/wiki/LSD)or [psilocybin](/wiki/Psilocybin). Many people prefer to have their DMT experiences in complete silence, other than shutting out perceptual distractions this is often done to prevent a muddled or overwhelming experience. [Memory suppression](/wiki/Memory_suppression) [Mindfulness](/wiki/Mindfulness)- This effect tends to occur after the experience has ended and the individual has returned to ordinary waking consciousness, to a sense of presence and sensitivity towards one's inner sensations as well as outer environment. [Multiple thought streams](/wiki/Multiple_thought_streams)- This effect tends to manifest in a much more chaotic fashion, in tandem with the sensation of cognitive overload. [Novelty enhancement](/wiki/Novelty_enhancement) [Personal bias suppression](/wiki/Personal_bias_suppression) [Rejuvenation](/wiki/Rejuvenation)- This effect tends to occur after the experience has ended and the subject has returned to ordinary waking consciousness, often in Near-Death Experience (NDE) variants of a DMT experience. [Autonomous voice communication](/wiki/Autonomous_voice_communication) [Time distortion](/wiki/Time_distortion)- This effect is a very prominent aspect of the DMT experience, which only tends to last under 15 minutes but is commonly reported to subjectively feel as if it had lasted much longer, in some cases \"many lifetimes\" or even an \"eternity\". This particular effect is most prevalent and notable with [\"breakthrough\" experiences](/wiki/DMT#Progressive_stages). [[11]](#cite_note-strassman-11) - Auditory effects - [Enhancements](/wiki/Auditory_enhancement)- Enhancements of one's auditory acuity, often following the end of the experience, have been reported in clinical studies with intravenously-administered DMT. [[11]](#cite_note-strassman-11) [Distortions](/wiki/Auditory_distortion) [[11]](#cite_note-strassman-11) [Hallucinations](/wiki/Auditory_hallucinations) - Multi-sensory effects - [Synaesthesia](/wiki/Synaesthesia)- In its fullest manifestation, this is a very rare and non-reproducible effect. Increasing the dosage can increase the likelihood of this occurring, but seems to only be a prominent part of the experience among those who are already predisposed to synaesthetic states. [Transpersonal](/wiki/Transpersonal) effects - For a number of individuals these effects are consistently more reproducible and powerful with smoked or vaporized DMT than they are with other \"classical psychedelics\" such as [LSD](/wiki/LSD)or [mescaline](/wiki/Mescaline), this is most likely due to its very intense but relatively short-lived effects. These components are unique to DMT in that for a majority of its users they are significantly more likely to manifest during \"breakthrough\" experiences as opposed to sub-breakthrough level experiences. Progressive stages When smoked or vaporized at moderate to heavy dosages, the DMT experience consistently manifests itself in a progressive sequence which can be described as follows: 1. \"Breaking Through\" The first step of a DMT trip is the come up that leads onto an experience commonly referred to as \"breaking through.\" This seems to have at least a few different ways of presenting itself to the user. The first thing that a person notices is an extremely distinct set of visual enhancements such an increase in [visual acuity](/wiki/Visual_acuity_enhancement) and [colour intensity](/wiki/Colour_enhancement). This is followed by a sudden onset of high level 3 [geometry](/wiki/Geometry) which increases in its intensity until it envelopes and covers the external environment. These effects are often accompanied by [auditory hallucinations](/wiki/Auditory_hallucination) such as soft crackling sounds or high pitched extended tones. There is also the possibility of accompanying physical sensations as one \"breaks through.\" These can include feelings of suddenly being pushed through and onto the other side of a membrane or feelings of shooting through space at high speeds. 2. \"The Waiting Room\" Almost immediately after a person has inhaled enough DMT to have \"broken through\", they often find themselves spending a brief amount of time in what is sometimes described as a [psychedelic](/wiki/Psychedelic) \"waiting room\" or \"loading screen.\" The appearance of this space can assume a seemingly infinite variety of forms but generally appears in the shape of an enveloping tunnel comprised of rapidly shifting, interlocking geometry. This lasts approximately 10 - 20 seconds and feels qualitatively different from other stages of the experience. 3. \"The Other Side\" Once the waiting period is over, the user will feel that they have \"broken through\" onto the other side. It is here where users experience intense level 7 [geometry](/wiki/Geometry) and level 3 - 4 [internal hallucinations](/wiki/Internal_hallucinations). It is worth noting that although experiences vary between individuals, DMT trips often follow common archetypes, [scenarios, content, and plots](/wiki/Scenarios_and_plots). These scenarios generally consist of visiting what appears to be an alternate reality that is often described to contain [autonomous entities](/wiki/Autonomous_entities), [settings, sceneries, and landscapes](/wiki/Settings,_sceneries,_and_landscapes) as well as themes a cosmic, transcendental, or [transpersonal](/wiki/Transpersonal) nature. 4. \"Drifting Down\" The final stage is experienced as the sensation of being pulled further and further away from the scenario until it is no longer visible and one finds themselves back in reality. This is typically accompanied by level 3 - 4 [geometry](/wiki/Geometry) as well as a sense of general exhilaration and awe. The moderate to mild [geometry](/wiki/Geometry) stays for a further 10 - 15 minutes before disappearing completely, sometimes leaving a noticeable \"body high\" that lingers for up to an hour.

[[22]](#cite_note-22) However, this view was contested by [David E. Nichols](/wiki/David_E._Nichols) in 2018, who argued that the pineal gland secretes insufficient amounts of DMT to produce psychoactive effects. [[23]](#cite_note-23) In 2019, a study by Jimo Borjigin demonstrated in rat brains that brain neurons with the two enzymes required to make DMT were not just in the pineal gland but also in the neocortex and hippocampus.

You can help by [Responsible use \u00a7 Hallucinogens](/wiki/Responsible_use#Hallucinogens) DMT is considered to be non-addictive, is not associated with any form of neurotoxicity, and has an extremely low toxicity relative to dose. As with other [psychedelic](/wiki/Psychedelic) substances, there are relatively few physical side effects associated with acute DMT exposure. Various studies have shown that in reasonable doses in a careful context, it has little to no negative cognitive, psychiatric or physical consequences. [[11]](#cite_note-strassman-11) However, as with psychedelics generally, DMT is thought to be able to act as a potential trigger for those with underlying psychiatric conditions. Those with a personal or family history of mental illness are advised not to use this substance unless under medical supervision. Despite the lack of physical risks, it is highly advised to approach this substance with extreme caution and [harm reduction practices](/wiki/Responsible_drug_use). Lethal dosage The median lethal dose ( [LD50](/wiki/LD50)) of DMT in humans has never been reached in any setting, nor is this expected to change due to its pharmacological properties. Dependence and abuse potential Like other [serotonergic psychedelics](/wiki/Serotonergic_psychedelics), DMT is considered to be non-addictive with a low abuse potential. [[11]](#cite_note-strassman-11) There are no literature reports of successful attempts to train animals to self-administer DMT \u2014 an animal model predictive of abuse liability \u2014 indicating that it does not have the necessary pharmacology to either initiate or maintain dependence. Likewise, there is virtually no withdrawal syndrome when chronic use of DMT is stopped.[ [citation needed](/wiki/Citation_needed)] Notably, tolerance to the effects of DMT does not appear to occur. The reason for this is unknown. Likewise, DMT does not produce cross-tolerance with other [psychedelics](/wiki/Psychedelics), meaning that after the consumption of DMT, psychedelics will not have a reduced effect. Dangerous interactions Warning: Many psychoactive substances that are reasonably safe to use on their own can suddenly become dangerous and even life-threatening when combined with certain other substances. The following list provides some known dangerous interactions (although it is not guaranteed to include all of them). Always conduct independent research (e.g. [DuckDuckGo](https://www.duckduckgo.com), [PubMed](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/)) to ensure that a combination of two or more substances is safe to consume. Some of the listed interactions have been sourced from [TripSit](https://combo.tripsit.me). [Lithium](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lithium_(medication))- Lithium is commonly prescribed for the treatment of [bipolar disorder](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bipolar_disorder). There is a large body of anecdotal evidence that suggests taking it with [psychedelics](/wiki/Psychedelics)significantly increases the risk of [psychosis](/wiki/Psychosis)and [seizures](/wiki/Seizures). As a result, this combination is strictly discouraged. [Cannabis](/wiki/Cannabis)- Cannabis may have an unexpectedly strong and unpredictable synergy with the effects of DMT. Caution is advised with this combination as it can significantly increase the risk of adverse psychological reactions like [anxiety](/wiki/Anxiety), [paranoia](/wiki/Paranoia), [panic attacks](/wiki/Panic_attacks), and [psychosis](/wiki/Psychosis). Users are advised to start off with only a fraction of their normal cannabis dose and take long breaks between hits to avoid unintentional overdose. [Stimulants](/wiki/Stimulants)- Stimulants like [amphetamine](/wiki/Amphetamine), [cocaine](/wiki/Cocaine)or [methylphenidate](/wiki/Methylphenidate)affect many parts of the brain and alter [dopaminergic](/wiki/Dopamine)function. This combination can increase the risk of [anxiety](/wiki/Anxiety), [paranoia](/wiki/Paranoia), [panic attacks](/wiki/Panic_attacks), and [thought loops](/wiki/Thought_loops).

The proposed changes included other similar blanket bans for other substances, such as a ban on any and all plants containing Mescaline or Ephedrine. The proposal was not pursued after political embarrassment on realisation that this would make the official Floral Emblem of Australia, Acacia pycnantha (Golden Wattle), illegal. The Therapeutic Goods Administration and federal authority had considered a motion to ban the same, but this was withdrawn in May 2012 (as DMT may still hold potential entheogenic value to native and/or religious people).
