These sources include surveys, cohort studies, and administrative data. Surveys may be administered to the general population or specific subgroups such as youth or high risk populations. Information may be collected for defined geographic areas or the province as a whole, and for calendar or fiscal years. This report collects and collates the most recent data available regarding substance use and associated morbidity, mortality and enforcement patterns. This report also includes up to date information on harm reduction strategies used to mitigate these adverse outcomes. We discuss interpretations, comparisons, and limitations of the data to provide the reader with a greater understanding of the bigger picture related to drug use in BC. 1 CHAPTER 1 Demographics\u2014summarizes the demographic characteristics of BC population including geographic distribution, life expectancy and mortality. - In 2013 the population of BC was estimated to be 4,581,978. - Of the five health authorities, Fraser Health has the smallest geographic area but a population of 1,689,875 (about 37% of BC's population). Northern Health is the largest geographic area but is the region with the smallest population (284,000). - Life expectancy at birth in BC continues to increase in all health authorities but disparities between them continue. In 2011, life expectancy at birth was 82.01 years overall in BC; V ancouver Coastal Health was highest at 83.67 years and Northern Health almost 5 years lower at 78.86 years . CHAPTER 2 Substance use trends\u2014 explores substance use trends among the general and high risk populations in BC. A subsection reports drug use patterns among youth - both in the general and high risk populations. Key findings include: - Among people who use illicit drugs in V ancouver (Urban Health Research Initiative) , Crack cocaine use has declined since reaching a high of 70% in 2008, but remains the highest reported drug used (34% in 2013). , Crystal methamphetamine use (injection and non-injection) reached its highest reported level to date in 2013 (17.8%). , The availability (ability to obtain drugs within 10 minutes) of illicit drugs increased from 2005 to 2007 but has remained fairly constant since. - Among clients accessing harm reduction supplies through-out BC in 2013 , Crack cocaine use is highest in the Northern Health region (67%). , Heroin use is highest in the Fraser Health region (54%). , Marijuana use is highest in Interior Health (60%). - Among BC youth in school, self-reported use of all psychoactive substances declined from 2008 to 2013. - Among a convenience sample of street-involved youth in Victoria and V ancouver , Crystal methamphetamine and cocaine are the most widely used illicit drugs after marijuana. , Reported crystal methamphetamine use in Victoria increased from 6% in 2011 to over 50% in 2013 . CHAPTER 3 Morbidity\u2014 analyzes substance related morbidity patterns. Hospitaliza-tions related to tobacco, alcohol, and illicit drugs are analyzed by health authority. Overdoses experienced and witnessed are reported from various surveys. Emergency room visits related to overdoses in V ancouver and overdoses at V ancouver's supervised injection site are reported. Calls to: BC ambulance determined as ingestion poisoning, Drug and Poison Information Centre, and HealthLink BC in 2013, and ambulance administered naloxone events throughout the province over time are shown. Key findings include: - T obacco use results in more hospitalizations than alcohol or illicit drugs in BC; 28,206, 21,542 and 4,326 related hospital-ization respectively in 2011. T obacco-related admissions are declining but those related to alcohol are increasing.~Objective of the Report ~Executive Summary EXECUTIVE SUMMARY7 YBC DOAP REPORT 2014 Y - In V ancouver, alcohol is the main substance responsible for overdose-related emergency room visits; visits appear higher in income assistance and/or disability assistance cheque issuance week. - Experiencing an overdose varied considerably by risk population and site: , About 30% of high risk recreational-use adults in V ancouver and Victoria. , About 18% of street involved youth in V ancouver but 28% in Victoria. , Adult harm reduction clients varied from 10-18% between health regions. - BC Ambulance Service receives between 150 and 200 calls per week which are coded as Ingestion Poisoning calls. - BC Poison and Information Centre receives an average of 70 calls each day about poison exposures. - HealthLink BC received between 400 and 500 calls from the public related to alcohol and other drugs per month in 2013. - In 2013, the BC Ambulance Service reported 2,011 naloxone administration events throughout BC. Over the last 5 years Fraser Health had the highest number of naloxone events (3,211) followed by V ancouver Coastal Health at 2,868 events. CHAPTER 4 HIV and hepatitis C virus\u2014 describes HIV and hepatitis C virus (HCV) disease background and patterns in BC, including case demographics, exposure categories, and testing/treatment strategies. Key findings include: HIV : - Newly diagnosed HIV cases in BC generally declined from 408 cases in 2003 to 237 in 2012; an increase was reported in all health authorities in 2013 (272 total cases); this increase in HIV identification was associated with increased testing. - About 12% of cases were female (33 female and 239 male in 2013) - Over half of cases diagnosed in 2013 were identified as men who have sex with men. - There were 29 new HIV cases among people who inject drugs in 2013 (same as 2012) down from 136 cases in 2003. HCV: - The BC HCV diagnosis rate continues to be higher than the Canadian average; 41.5 and 19.3 cases per 100,000 population respectively in 2012.- After a steady decline since 1997, the number of cases of HCV identified in BC rose in 2013 to 2,105 (from 1,886 in 2012). - HCV testing has increased annually; in 2013 there were more than 200,000 HCV tests performed - From 2008 through 2012, all regional health authorities experienced an overall decrease of 24 month HCV seroconversion in people who had repeat tests. In 2013 rates were similar in all health authorities. - New effective treatments for HCV with fewer side-effects are being developed, are expensive and currently not yet widely available in BC. CHAPTER 5 Mortality\u2014 analyzes deaths in BC related to substance use. - V ancouver Downtown East Side has an overall mortality rate almost five times higher than the province. - In 2011, the tobacco-related death rate was three times the alcohol-related death rate, which was three times the illicit drug rate (87, 23 and 7 cases per 100,000 population respectively). - Illicit drug-related mortality rates in 2011 were highest in Fraser Health - In 2013, illicit drug overdose deaths in BC increased to over 300 deaths , About a quarter of these deaths were female , Males aged 20-29 years had the highest rate followed by males 40-49 years. , The vast majority (90%) of these deaths were determined to be accidental. - Since 2007, overdose deaths due to mixed drugs and multiple narcotics have been the leading cause of illicit drug deaths. - BC is experiencing an increase of fentanyl-detected deaths (15 in 2012 to 51 in 2013). - In 2010 there were 72 deaths identified in people prescribed opioids. CHAPTER 6 Harm Reduction\u2014 describes provincial safer sex, safer injection and safer inhalation supply distribution. V ancouver's supervised injection facility (Insite), BC's T ake Home Naloxone program, methadone maintenance therapy (including the change to Methadose) and the NAOMI and SALOME studies are discussed. Key findings include: EXECUTIVE SUMMARY8 YBC DOAP REPORT 2014 YJBack to T able of Content - 76% of British Columbians support harm reduction - In 2013, the harm reduction program distributed more than 4 million condoms throughout BC. - Needle/syringe distribution throughout BC increased from 4.18 million in 2006 to over 8 million in 2013. - Population rate of needle/syringe distribution varies by health authority. V ancouver Coastal Health had the highest rate and Fraser Health the lowest (at 450 and <50 needles per 100 population respectively). - Almost half of harm reduction clients who inject drugs re-ported difficulty acquiring needles, citing supply distribution center operating hours and distance as the main barriers. - In 2012, there were 376,149 visits to InSite by 9,259 unique individuals. - In its first 2 years, the BC T ake Home Naloxone program has 51 sites, trained 2,214 people, dispensed 1,215 naloxone kits and 125 overdose reversals were reported. - Between April 1, 2012 and March 31, 2013, there were 14,833 patients in BC's methadone maintenance program. - In February 2014, BC changed methadone formulation from a compounded 1mg/ml solution to Methadose - a liquid 10 times more concentrated.CHAPTER 7 Enforcement\u2014 describes drug-related crime and police enforcement prac-tices in BC and explores alternative enforcement practices to incarceration, such as V ancouver's Drug Treatment Court. Drug trafficking patterns are also discussed. - Possession charges comprised almost 80% of Controlled Drugs and Substances Act offences (CDSA) in BC in 2012; trafficking accounted for 14%, production 6%, and importation/exportation 0.5%. - In 2012, four of the top five census metropolitan areas with the highest drug crime rate in Canada were in BC. - The rate of CDSA offences in V ancouver has consistently declined since 2006; in 2013 the rate was less than half the 2006 rate. - Of all BC drug offences in 2012, cannabis represented about 70%, cocaine 17% and heroin 2.9%; but in V ancouver cannabis was 40%, cocaine 37%, and heroin 15%. - There were more pharmacy robberies and break-ins in the first six months of 2014 than in all 2013. - The estimated value of drugs seized by Canada Border Services Agency in 2013 was over $47 million CDN. The wellbeing of people who use drugs (PWUD) is threatened by high-risk drug use, limited access to healthcare and social services, and stigma. Harm Reduction (HR) is a range of public health policies designed to reduce the harmful effects of high-risk behaviours through a range of non-judgmental strategies. HR provides the knowledge, skills, resources and support for individuals, their families, and communities to be safer. The principles of HR, along with prevention, treatment and enforcement, make up the four pillars approach to drug addiction - a coordinated and comprehensive strategy to reduce harms from the use of psychoactive substances to create safer, healthier communities. 2 The four pillars approach was first implemented in Europe and adopted by City of V ancouver in 2000. 2 The BC Drug Overdose and Alert Partnership (DOAP) is a multi-sectoral committee that was established to prevent and reduce the harms associated with substance use (DOAP members are listed on page 1). The group identifies and disseminates timely information about harms related to substance use including overdose, adverse reactions to contaminated products, and other emerging issues. At quarterly meetings, committee members provide context and share insights about data from their respective agency. Provisional data, including monthly illicit drug overdose deaths, and weekly data: ambulance calls for poisonings, V ancouver hospital emergency room attendance for overdose, overdoses at InSite, and Drug and Poison Information Centre calls related to drugs, are available to the DOAP members on a password protected website. Concerns and questions can be posted on the website and communicated to the members who work together to identify the need for alerts and to develop solutions. 3 The BC Harm Reduction Strategies and Services (HRSS) Committee uses evidence-based policy and guidelines to reduce the harms of drug-related events. The HRSS committee has representatives from the five BC regional Health Authorities (HA), the BC Ministry of Health, BCCDC, First Nations Health ~Background ~Harm Reduction Committees and Health Authorities in BC BACKGROUND9 YBC DOAP REPORT 2014 Y Authority (FNHA), and other key harm reduction stakeholders to provide a structure to facilitate coordination of HR in BC.4 Each HA is responsible for providing health services within a defined geographic region 8: Fraser Health (FH), V ancouver Coastal Health (VCH), V ancouver Island Health Authority (VIHA), Interior Health (IH), and Northern Health (NH). Each HA is further divided into three or four Health Service Delivery Areas (HSDAs); for example VCH is comprised of the Richmond, Vancouver and North Shore/Coast Garibaldi HSDAs. These regions are illustrated in Figure 1.1. Each HSDA is made up of smaller geographical units called Local Health Areas (LHAs). Using the example of VCH once more, V ancouver HSDA is further divided into six LHAs: City Centre, Downtown East Side, North East, Westside, Midtown, and South V ancouver. The BC First Nations Health Authority (FNHA) is the first province-wide health authority of its kind in Canada. In 2013, the FNHA assumed the programs, services and responsibilities formerly held by Health Canada's First Nations Inuit Health Branch - BC Region. 5 First Nations people in BC and across Canada experience statistically significant health disparities, including dispropor-tionally high substance addiction/abuse and infection rates of HIV and hepatitis C (HCV). Factors, such as colonization, discrimination, the experience of residential schools, and high rates of unemployment have exacerbated these health inequities. Based on the 2007 BC Tripartite First Nations Health Plan, the three partners of BC First Nations, the Province of BC, and the Government of Canada are working together \"to improve health services, shift the emphasis to wellness and preventing illness, improve performance tracking and the creation of a new First Nations health governance structure\" . 611 12 13213333 43 43 42 4151 1411 East Kootenay 12 Kootenay Boundary 13 Okanagan 14 Thompson Cariboo Shuswap 21 Fraser East 22 Fraser North 23 Fraser South 31 Richmond 32 Vancouver 33 North Shore/Coast Garibaldi 41 South V ancouver Island 42 Central V ancouver Island 43 North V ancouver Island 51 Northwest 52 Northern Interior 53 NortheastFort Nelson Prince George VictoriaKamploops Kewlona 400 kmHealth Service Delivery Areas Interior Health Fraser Health Vancouver Coastal Health Vancouver Island Health Northern HealthBC Health Authorities 25 km3321 22 23Vancouver 32 31NFigure 1.1 Map of regional health authorities and health service delivery areas in BC BACKGROUNDJBack to T able of Content DEMOGRAPHICS OF BC POPULA TION 10 YBC DOAP REPORT 2014 Y CHAPTER 1 DEMOGRAPHICS OF BC POPULA TION The population of BC continues to increase; it was 3.00 million in 1986 and reached 4.58 million in 2013. When broken down by health authority (HA), the smallest geographic region FH has the largest population at about 1.69 million in 2013; VCH has 1.14 million, VIHA 0.75 million, IH 0.72 million and NH, the largest geographic region, has the smallest population with 0.28 million (Figure 1.2). Overall, there are slightly more females than males in BC, with a female to male ratio of 1.01; similar trends exist in all HAs except NH which has more males than females (0.95). 7 Demographic analysis of the general population is useful to understand at-risk populations and compare the rate of occurrence of a disease or event across different regions. NH has a comparatively young population compared to the other health authorities. 9 Age adjusted rates or standardised ratios take into account the age of the population. 0 Population Population Size4 3 2 1 0Figure 1.2 BC population size based on health authority 2014 Y CHAPTER 1 0 Life Expectancy Life expectancy at birth (the average number of years a person may expect to live) can be used to represent the health of a given population; i.e. healthier populations are expected to live longer. As shown in Figure 1.3, life expectancy in all BC regional HAs increased over the past 20 years, with VCH experiencing the greatest improvement. 9 BC has the highest life expectancy of all provinces in Canada at 82.01 years in 2007-2011. However, there are large regional differences within BC. 10,11 0 Housing Housing is internationally recognized as a key determinant of health. BC has a shortage of 'affordable housing' , which is de-fined as shelter that costs no more than 30% of one's income. 12 In 2006, 29.1% of BC households spent over 30% of income on housing, compared to the Canadian average of 24.9%. 13 Paying more for shelter leaves fewer resources for food, clothing, and other necessities. The growing cost of housing in BC has led to increasing rates of homelessness and unstable housing, which is largely concentrated in V ancouver and other urban centres. In BC, the recorded homeless population is disproportionate ly more male, Aboriginal, and middle aged.14,15 Homeless and unstably housed populations have a higher prevalence of drug addiction and mental health problems. 15,16 In 2014, the Metro V ancouver homeless count identified 2,770 people in the Metro V ancouver region as homeless; of these, 957 lived outside or stayed temporarily with others, 200 had no fixed address, and the remaining 1,613 were staying in overnight homeless shelters, transition houses, or safe houses. 16 In Victoria, a 2011 facility YearsFigure 1.3 Life expectancy at birth in BC based on health authority between 1987-201111 84 83 82 818079787675 OF BC POPULA TION 12 YBC DOAP REPORT 2014 Y count found 1,143 people staying in temporary and emergen cy shelters.17 A 2010 count for Prince George identified 287 persons as homeless or unstably housed.15 Homeless counts are cross-sectional (that is they provide a snapshot at a specific time) but may underestimate the total number of homeless and unstably housed persons in these cities.Unstable housing is defined by Urban Health Research Institute (URHI) as living in a shelter or hostel, treatment or recovery house, jail, single room occupancy hotel, on the street, or having no fixed address.18 UHRI reported 60% of people who use drugs (PWUD) in V ancouver 1 were unstably housed in 2011 (Figure 1.5).18 1 Determined from combined data from three longitudinal V ancouver based drug use cohorts; V ancouver Injection Drug Users Survey (VIDUS), At-Risk Y outh Survey (ARYS) + AIDS Care Cohort to Evaluate access to Survival Services (ACCESS) cohorts]Figure 1.5 Patterns of unstable housing, single room occupancy hotel use and homelessness among PWUD in Vancouver, 1996-201118 Note: 'Unstable housing' includes living in a shelter or hostel, treatment or recovery house, jail, single room occupancy hotel, on the street, or having no fixed address.Unstable housing Single room occupancy 30% 20% 10% 0% 1996 1997 1998 1999 2000 2001 2002 2003 2004 2005 2006 2007 2008 2009 2010 201113 YBC DOAP REPORT 2014 Y CHAPTER 2 CHAPTER 2 SUBSTANCE USE TRENDS 0 General Population and Substance Use The Canadian Alcohol and Drug Use Monitoring Survey (CADUMS) is a general population telephone survey, thus participants must have a landline phone and are willing to answer the survey. In 2011, CADUMS found 89.7% of Canadians reported consuming alcohol at some point in their life (78.0% in the past 12 months), and 39.4% have ever used cannabis (9.1% in the past 12 months).19 The Canadi an Centre on Substance Abuse identifies the threshold for low-risk drinking for chronic harms as exceeding 15 drinks per week/3 drinks per day for males and 10 drinks per week/2 drinks per day for females; and for acute harms 5+/4+ drinks on one occasion for males/females respectively.Figure 2.1a and 2.1b show CADUMS risky alcohol use by male and female participants from 2008 to 2012. From 2008 to 2010 males were significantly (p < 0.05) more likely to report drinking in excess of the low risk drinking guidelines for chronic harms than females in BC and Canada (Figure 2.1a). The proportion of males and females reporting risky alcohol use for acute harms are higher in BC than the rest of Canada (Figure 2.1b). 20 Figure 2.1 CADUMS substance use trends in BC and Canada based on gender, 2008-2012; a) Prevalence of risky drinking in past year for chronic harms, b) Prevalence of risky drinking in past year for acute harms18 8 5.423.1 19.9 13.8 13.24.6 4.24.130 25201510 506 420 2008 Year 2009 2010 2011 2012a) Prevalence of risky drinking in past year for chronic* harms among Canadians aged 15+ by gender, 2008-12Risky drinkers for chronic harms (%) BC FemalesRest of CanadaFemalesBCMalesRest of CanadaMales * Having 16+ drinks in men and 11+ in women weekly2008 Year 2009 2010 2011 2012b) Prevalence of risky drinking in past year for acute* harms among Canadians aged 15+ by gender, 2008-12 Risky drinkers for acute harms (%) BC FemalesRest of CanadaFemalesBCMalesRest of CanadaMales * Having 5+ drinks in men and 4+ in women weekly on one occassion atleast once in past 30 daysJBack to T able of Content SUBSTANCE USE TRENDS 14 YBC DOAP REPORT 2014 Y Figure 2.2 presents per capita alcohol consumption for individuals 15 and older in BC and Canada between 1998/99 and 2012/13. Alcohol consumption in Canada and BC steadily increased until 2007/08. Alcohol consumption in BC consistently exceeds the Canadian average. Please note that the Alcohol and Other Drug (AOD) monitoring project estimates of alcohol consumption are higher because they include UBrew and UVin sales. 20 UBrews and UVins are businesses that sell ingredients and equipment used to produce beer, wine, ciders, or coolers. 20 Figure 2.2 Annual per capita age 15+ alcohol consumption for BC and Canada in litres of absolute alcohol, 1998/99 to 2012/1320 Litres of absolute alcohol per person per year Fiscal Year9.5 8.48 8.109.0British Columbia(AOD Y CHAPTER 2 Per capita alcohol consumption based on 2011 alcohol sales data (reported in litres of absolute alcohol) among resident adults (15 years and older) for the 16 HSDA in BC is shown in figure 2.3. The rate was calculated by the sales per resident population, the highest rate at 13.31 litres per adult was in the northern geographic region of North Shore/Coast Garibaldi HSDA (which includes Bella Coola V alley). The lowest rate, 4.51 litre per adult, was in Richmond.

However, cannabis use in both sexes was higher in BC and an increase was reported among BC males in 2012 (Figure 2.4a). Males in BC and the rest of Canada were significantly (p < 0.05) more likely than females to report cannabis use (Figure 2.4b).

Prevalence was estimated using the number of the people who reported using any illicit drugs including cocaine, speed, methamphetamine, ecstasy, hallucinogens, inhalants, heroin, pain relievers, stimulants, and sedatives divided by the sample population. In BC and the rest of Canada, males were more likely than females to use illicit substances and the prevalence of illicit drug use between 2008 and 2012 is significantly higher (p < 0.05) in BC compared to the rest of Canada. 20 0 High Risk Populations and Substance Use CARBC's High Risk Populations survey is a convenience sample of 50 street-involved adults and 50 adults using drugs recreationally, in V ancouver and Victoria every six months. These high risk populations report higher alcohol, cannabis, and other illicit substances use compared to the general population. However, substance use patterns vary between these two high- risk populations. Figure 2.7 shows that in 2012, 1% of recreation al drug using adults compared to 78% of street-involved adults reported crack cocaine use in the previous month, while 88% versus 6% in the same groups used ecstasy. There are also statistically significant differences in crystal methamphet amine, heroin, LSD, and mushroom use.20 The survey also found 36% of the recreational-use adult co-horts in V ancouver and Victoria reported simultaneous alcohol and marijuana use over the previous weekend, and 11% reported simultaneous use of alcohol and cocaine. Using more than one substance at a time (poly-substance use) was lower among street-involved adults, the most frequently mixed substances being alcohol and marijuana (10%) followed by crystal meth and heroin (7.5%). 207 6 5 4 3 2 10Figure 2.6 CADUMS substance use trends in BC and Canada by gender, 2008-2012; Prevalence of other illicit substance use (excluding cannabis) in the past 12 months20 Prevalence of other illicit substance use (excluding cannabis) in the past year among Canadians 15+ by gender, 2008-2012 2008 Year 2009 2010 2011 2012 BC FemalesRest of CanadaFemalesBCMalesRest of CanadaMalesIllicit drug users (%)- 4.7 3.6 1.61.4 BC numbers for females 2011-12 and males 2011 were suppressed due to unstable estimates19 YBC DOAP REPORT 2014 Y CHAPTER 2 Drugs used at least weekly reported by the VIDUS and ACCESS cohorts are shown in Figure 2.8 and 2.9. Figure 2.8 indicates considerable changes in weekly drug use (by any route) over time. Cocaine use declined since 1996, while crack cocaine use increased from 5.1% in 1996 to 70.6% in 2008 but declined to 34% in 2013. Crystal methamphetamine use reached its highest recorded level in 2013 (17.8 %).Figure 2.7 Past month substance use in high risk populations in Victoria and Vancouver, 2012 (Wave 2)20 Alcohol Marijuana Tobacco Cocaine Crack Amphetamine Crystal Meth Heroin Ecstasy LSD Magic MushroomsPercentage Street involved adults 7469 125 6388 5575 651060 40 20 0 Figure 2.8 Weekly drug use* patterns among people who use illicit drugs in Vancouver, Canada, 1996-2013 1996 1997 1998 1999 2000 2001 2002 2003 2004 2005 2006 2007 2008 2009 2010 2011 2012 201380 7060 50 40 30 20 10 0Percentage Cocaine Crack Crystal Meth Heroin Marijuana Prescription opioids (BC Centre for Excellence in HIV/AIDS, personal communication, June 10, 2014)* Note: each category in the graph captures both injection and non-injection use of the specified drugJBack to T able of Content SUBSTANCE USE TRENDS 20 YBC DOAP REPORT 2014 Y Figure 2.9 shows weekly drug use by route of administration; illicit prescription opioid use (i.e. use of prescription opioids without a valid (pentazocine). Most high-risk drug use research in BC is conducted in V ancouver and Victoria. T o gain a better understanding of drug use outside these two cities, over 700 clients using harm reduction distribution sites throughout BC were surveyed in 2012 and 2013 (HR client survey). 22,23 In 2013, drug use was weighted by HSDA population; the three most commonly used substances were marijuana (51%), alcohol (48%), and crack (35%). Substance use patterns vary between regions as seen in Figure 2.10. Crack use was highest in NH (67%) and lowest in VCH (33%). Powdered cocaine use was also highest in the NH region. By contrast, reported use of heroin and crystal meth was lower in NH compared to other regions of BC and highest in FH (54% and 48% respectively). 23 Figure 2.9 Weekly substance use prevalence among people who use illicit drugs in Vancouver, Canada, 2013 Percentage Cocaine Injection Cocaine Non-Injection Crystal Meth Injection Crystal Meth Non-Injection (BC Centre for Excellence in HIV/AIDS, personal communication, June 10, 2014)40 3530 25 19.3 3.414.9 7.934.0 8.6 4.926.1 25.2 20 15 10 5 021 YBC DOAP REPORT 2014 Y CHAPTER 2 0 Substance Availability and Cost The availability of illicit drugs in V ancouver is reported by UHRI as the percentage of PWUD who can obtain the drug within 10 minutes. PWUD in V ancouver were more likely able to obtain crack cocaine (80%), cocaine (70%) and heroin (70%) than cannabis (65%) or crystal methamphetamine within 10 minutes in 2011. URHI cohort participants identified the cost of drugs has been stable over the past 10 years: - Heroin $20 per 0.1 gram since 2001, - Powder cocaine and crack cocaine $10 per 0.1 gram - Crystal methamphetamine $10 per 0.1 gram. The availability and consistent price of drugs in the V ancouver area does not support the claim that law enforcement efforts have reduced the available drug supply and increased the cost of illicit substances. 18 The Centre for Addiction Research of BC (CARBC)'s High Risk Population survey in V ancouver and Victoria shows similar trends in drug prices and availability. Since 2008, cocaine, crack, heroin, and crystal meth have been reported by street-involved adults in both cities as being either \"easy\" or \"very easy\" to obtain. Furthermore, the reported street prices of these substances are very similar to those reported in UHRI's research and have fluctuated little over the years. 20 More information on drug trafficking can be found in the enforcement chapter of this report. The 2014 UNODC World Drug Report identifies Canada as the country with the highest consumption of prescription opioids, with 812.2 mg per capita of morphine equivalence (see T able 2.1); the next highest is United States at 749.79 mg per capita. 24 Canada's high rate of pain medication prescribing and availability has serious implications for drug-related harms and diversion.Figure 2.10 Percent of HR clients reporting substance use in the past week by HA, weighted by HSDA population, 201323 70 605040302010 0 Marijuana Alcohol Meth Cocaine FH VCH VIHA IH NHPercentageJBack to T able of Content SUBSTANCE USE TRENDS 22 YBC DOAP REPORT 2014 Y 0 Oxycontin OxyContin, a patented prescription version of oxycodone used to treat moderate to intense pain, was discontinued in Canada in March 2012. 25 OxyContin was a slow-release narcotic when taken orally as intended; however, users could release high levels of the drug instantaneously by crushing and snorting the tablet. OxyNEO was introduced by the same manufacturer, Purdue Pharma, as a replacement drug that was designed to be harder to crush and dissolve, limiting abuse through snorting and injecting. 25,26 Since its introduction, several provincial health plans altered their drug coverage to restrict coverage of OxyNEO. In BC, only exceptional case-by-base coverage requests for OxyNEO are considered and it is only covered through the palliative care plan. 27,28 There are concerns that the recent lack of OxyContin is leading some opioid dependant users to seek out more accessible and potentially more dangerous opioids. A US-based study found that after the formulation changed, misuse of OxyContin among patients undergoing opioid dependence treatment decreased from 35.6% to 12.8%. 29 However, fentanyl and hydromorphone use increased among these patients, and heroin use doubled. 29 Although the replacement of OxyContin with OxyNEO was intended to address concerns over misuse of the drug, Health Canada's subsequent decision in November 2012 to approve generic production of extended release oxycodone allowed off-brand versions to enter the Canadian pharmaceutical market. 30 These generic versions are not currently covered under BC's provincial formulary.28 0 Medical Marijuana There have been recent developments regarding medical marijuana licensing. Health Canada's 2014 proposed Marijuana for Medical Purposes Regulations (MMPR) required patients to end home production of medical marijuana on April 1, 2014. 31 However, following a consti- tutional challenge to the MMPR, a Federal Court granted an injunction on March 21, 2014. 32 This allows those with personal and designated production licenses (for persons responsible for the patient) to continue home production of medical marijuana until the case goes to trial in spring 2015. 32 The injunction does not affect Health Canada's new medical marijuana licensing system for dispensing prescribed marijuana, and there are concerns that new patients will have difficulty affording the higher marijuana prices projected to result from the federal legislation. 32 On a related note, licensed sales of recreational marijuana began in Washington State on July 8, 2014. 33 This may have implications on illicit cannabis trade with BC, given the U.S. state's close proximity.Table 2.1 Morphine equivalence consumption per capita Canada, CHAPTER 2 0 Fentanyl BC has experienced a recent increase in fentanyl availability and fentanyl-detected deaths. Fentanyl is a synthetic narcotic that is used to relieve intense pain. In BC, fentanyl can be prescribed for pain management as a transdermal patch, which provides sustained release of the drug. 34 However, this formulation is susceptible to abuse through the extraction of patch contents and subsequent intrave-nous injection. 35 Fentanyl is 50-100 times more potent than morphine, which greatly increases the risk of accidental overdose. 36 Early signs of fentanyl overdose include severe sleepiness, slow heartbeat, difficulty breathing, cold/clammy skin, and trouble with walking or talking. 36 The RCMP and municipal police forces in BC have identi - fied illegally manufactured fentanyl as a white powder resembling heroin and in tablet form as counterfeit oxycodone (fake oxy) tablets. 37,38 Illegally-produced fentanyl can be significantly more toxic than the pharma-ceutical-grade. 39 T ablets containing fentanyl are green and are stamped with \"CDN\" and the number 80 on the opposite sides (Figure 2.11). These pills are nicknamed \"green jellies\" and \"street oxy\" in Western Canada. 37 White tablets with \"CDN\" and \"10\" stamped on them have also appeared in British Columbia (Figure 2.11). Seized quan-tities of these two versions tested positive for fentanyl 89% of the time and contain variable, sometimes very high, dose of fentanyl. 37 Individuals using these drugs may be under the assumption that they contain oxycodone only and are therefore at high risk of accidental overdose.On May 30th, 2013 in response to an increase in fentayl- detected deaths in BC, a joint alert was issued by the Provincial Health Officer, BC Coroners Service (BCCS), healthcare and enforcement partners, warning the public of the increase in deaths and availability of fentanyl within the street drug market. After the alert fentanyl- detected deaths declined in June and July 2013, but have since increased. In 2012 there were 15 fentanyl-detected deaths; a total of 51 fentanyl-detected deaths were iden-tified in BC in 2013; most 2013 fentanyl-detected deaths occurred in Metro V ancouver region (15), Island (14), and Fraser (12) (Figure 2.12). Preliminary data from the BCCS indicates 49 fentanyl- detected deaths occurred in the first eight months of 2014 (January 1st to August 31st) of these 10 occurred in the City of V ancouver and 18 in the Fraser region, about a third (16) were female. Please note that 2013 and 2014 data are preliminary and subject to change and these deaths only include fentanyl found in illicit drug-related circumstances, and exclude overdose deaths in persons prescribed fentanyl. 40 In June 2014, the BCCS issued another public warning urging all PWUD to exercise extreme caution when consuming substances that may contain fentanyl. More information regarding fentanyl can be found in the Mortality section. 37 Figure 2.11 Samples of seized counterfeit oxycodone tablets39 JBack to T able of Content SUBSTANCE USE TRENDS 24 YBC DOAP REPORT 2014 Y Number of Deaths16 14 12 10 8 6 42 2012 2013 Jan 1-Aug 31 20140 Fraser 6 323 1 1512 1514 3 7 5118 12 77 5 49Metro Island Interior Northern TotalFigure 2.12 Fentanyl-detected deaths by BCCS region, 2012-201440 Figure 2.13 Fentanyl-detected deaths by sex, 2012-201440 50 40 30 20 10 0 2012 2013 Jan 1-Aug 31 2014 Male Female12 342 933 16Number of Deaths25 YBC DOAP REPORT 2014 Y CHAPTER 2 0 Y outh YOUTH IN SCHOOL The McCreary Centre Society recruits grade 7-12 students in public schools throughout BC to participate in the Adolescent Health Survey (AHS) every five years. Since these participants are in school, they are unlikely to have major substance use problems. The 2013 survey had 259,138 participants and found that self-reported substance use among BC adolescents has declined since 2003 (Figures 2.14 and 2.15). Alcohol was the most commonly used substance in 2013, with 45% of BC youth reporting that they had tried it. 41 Self-reported use of steroids, heroin, inhalants, amphetamines, or cocaine has remained stable or declined since 2003. Adolescent use of prescription pills peaked in 2008.

The most cited reason was \"I wanted to have fun\" followed by \"my friends were doing it\" and \"I wanted to try it/experiment\" . Mental health factors were also reported as reasons for drug use: 'because of stress' or feeling \"down or sad\" . Y outh who reported self-harm in the past year were more likely to use substances compared to those who had not self-harmed (43% vs. 14% respectively). 41 Figure 2.16 Age when BC youth used alcohol or cannabis for the first time41 Percentage Age (years)25 2015 10 5 0 <9 9 10 11 12 for last time substance uses for BC youth41 Males Females I wanted to have funMy friends were doing itI wanted to try it/experimentBecause of stressI felt down or sadI felt like there was nothing else to doTo manage physical painI was pressured into doing it I thought it would help me focus Because of an addictionI didn't mean to do it To change the effects of some other drug(s) Other27 YBC DOAP REPORT 2014 Y CHAPTER 2 About half of youth who used substances in the past year reported negative consequences. The most frequent responses were \"doing something they could Substance use trends from the 2013 East Kootenay Addiction Service Society (EKASS) survey are similar to the AHS data. Since 2005, the proportion of East Kootenay area in-school youth experimenting with substances has declined. In 2013, females reported using fewer substances than males. This is in contrast to prior years; for example, alcohol use was 72.0% for girls and 70.3% for boys in 2007, but was 58.5% and 62.0% in 2013; similarly, cannabis use for girls and boys was 36.2% and 35.4% in 2007, but 27.3% and 33.6% respectively in 2013. 42 The EKASS reports the proportion of students admitting to being in a car with an alcohol-impaired driver reached a high of 60.1% in 2009, but was 46.4% in 2013; a consid-erable decrease but still unacceptably high. Y outh who reported driving after drinking alcohol also dropped from 20.1% in 2005 to 12.0% in 2013. Rate of self-reports of being a passenger in a car with a cannabis-impaired driver was 29.5% in 2011. These declines may also reflect the overall decrease in substance use among youth. 42 HIGH RISK YOUTH The proportion of lifetime drug use among a convenience sample of V ancouver and Victoria area street-involved youth aged 15-24 in the CARBC high risk survey is considerably higher than the in-school youth surveys (Figure 2.17). Although 2013 data is available for Victoria, the most recent data available for V ancouver is 2012. In 2012, marijuana use was more common than alcohol or tobacco, and over 90% of youth reported ever using cocaine at both sites. Reported lifetime use of amphetamines and ecstasy is more prevalent in street-involved youth from Victoria (53% and 95%) than V ancouver (38% and 83%). 20 Table 2.3 Consequences of substance use by BC youth in the rememberPassed outGot injuredArgued with family membersDamaged propertyGot in policeSchoolwork or grades changedGot into a physical fightLost friends or broke up with a girlfriend or boyfriend Had sex when I didn't want to OverdosedHad to get treatment for alcohol or drug abuseUsed alcohol or drugs but none of this things happenedJBack to T able of Content SUBSTANCE USE TRENDS 28 YBC DOAP REPORT 2014 Y Figure 2.18 shows past 30 day substance use in V ancouver in 2012. More recent data (2013) for Victoria (Figure 2.19) shows alcohol use in the past 30 days reached its lowest reported prevalence (59.5%), while crystal meth use (81.1%) shows a steep increase since the second 2011 wave (28%). Crack, LSD, and heroin use declined between the two 2013 waves, however this is a small convenience sample (n=50 per wave per city) so rates may be unstable. 20Figure 2.17 Percentage of Vancouver and Victoria street-involved youth who have ever used substances, 201220Percentage Vancouver Victoria100 90 80 70 60 50 40 30 20 10 0Alcohol Marijuana Tobacco Cocaine Crack Amphetamine Crystal Meth Heroin Ecstasy LSD Magic Mushrooms Figure 2.18 Substance use trends in the past 30 days among street-involved youth in Vancouver, 2008-201220Percentage100 90 80 7060 50 4030 20 10 0 Cocaine Crack Crystal Meth Heroin Marijuana Alcohol2008 Wave 12008 Wave 12012 Wave 229 YBC DOAP REPORT 2014 Y CHAPTER 2 When asked about the perceived benefits of drug use in 2013 reasons most cited were: helping with social connections, alleviating symptoms of mental and physical illness, and making respondents feel happy, calm, and in some cases, more productive. 20 The At-Risk Y outh Survey (ARYS) led by UHRI studies risk factors for 14-26 year old street-involved youth in V ancouver. Figure 2.20 represents drugs used by any route at least weekly among ARYS participants. Reported marijuana use declined considerably be-tween 2012 and 2013. However, crystal methamphetamine use has increased over the past 3 years, similar to that seen in the high-risk youth in Victoria (Figure 2.19). The proportion of ARYS participants reporting weekly crack use in 2013 (16.4%) is considerably lower than the older V ancouver-based VIDUS and ACCESS cohorts (Figure 2.8), for which crack was the most widely used substance that year.

The most responsible diagnosis code from the Ministry of Health Discharge Abstract Database was used to calculate hospitalizations attributable to tobacco, alcohol and illicit drug use. All rates were standardized by age and sex using the 2001 BC population over 15 years of age as the standard. Figure 3.1 shows hospitalizations related to tobacco use exceeded those due to alcohol and illicit drugs. The rate of tobacco hospitalizations dropped significantly, from 601 hospitalizations per 100,000 population in 2002 to 526 in 2011. However, while the rate of alcohol-related hospitalizations significantly increased, those attributable to illicit drugs did not significantly change. 20 Figure 3.1 Hospitalizations related to substance use in BC20 30,000650 601 378 82526 437 95550 450 350 250 150 5028,206 21,542 4,326 2002 2003 2004 2005 2006 2007 2008 2009 2010 201125,000 20,000 15,000 10,000 5,000 0 Tobacco Alcohol Illicit drugsa) Number of BC hospitalizations related to substance use, 2011b) Hospitalizations rates related to substance use in BC, 2002-2011Number of hospitalisations Rates per 100,000 population Tobacco Alcohol Illicit Drugs31 YBC DOAP REPORT 2014 Y CHAPTER 3 In 2011, Northern Interior HSDA had the highest hospitalization rate for tobacco and Richmond the lowest (Figure 3.2a). Similar trends exist for alcohol as seen in figure 3.2b. The highest alcohol-attributable hospitalization rate is in Northwest, while Richmond had the lowest. For illicit drug-attributable hospitalizations (Figure 3.2c), the highest rate was found in Northwest, followed by Northern Interior, Kootenay Boundary, and Northeast. The lowest rates were observed in Richmond, Fraser North, and North Shore/Coast Garibaldi. These data suggest that the interior and northern regions of the province have higher rates of substance-related morbidity. Similar trends are seen in the mortality rates related to tobacco and alcohol use, but not for illicit drugs. This is further discussed in the mortality section. 20 11 East Kootenay (569.18) 12 Kootenay Fraser (648.97) 22 Fraser North (545.67) 23 Fraser South (500.19) 31 Richmond (414.42)32 Vancouver (427.64) 33 North Shore/Coast Garibaldi (457.96) 41 South Vancouver Island (404.40) 42 Central Vancouver Island (527.77) 43 North Vancouver Island (560.76) 51 Northwest (730.15) 52 Northern Interior (752.35) 53 Northeast (656.05)Hospitalization Rate per 100,000 Residents > 749.99 550 - 749.99 550 - 649.99 450 - 549.99< 450 11 (509.29) Fraser (366.51) 22 Fraser North (319.04) 23 Fraser South (334.45) 31 Richmond (315.43)32 Vancouver (321.60) 33 North Shore/Coast Garibaldi (400.89) 41 South Vancouver Island (466.37) 42 Central Vancouver Island (535.73) 43 North Vancouver Island (564.61) 51 Northwest (959.65) 52 Northern Interior (676.65) 53 Northeast (534.88)Hospitalization Rate per 100,000 Residents > 699.99 600 - 699.99 500 - 599.99 400 - 499.99< 400 11 (102.90) Fraser (109.58) 22 Fraser North (57.87) 23 Fraser South (73.07) 31 Richmond (52.97)32 Vancouver (73.80) 33 North Shore/Coast Garibaldi (68.04) 41 South Vancouver Island (88.98) 42 Central Vancouver Island (93.75) 43 North Vancouver Island (98.66) 51 Northwest (171.38) 52 Northern Interior (133.33) 53 Northeast (121.53)Hospitalization Rate per 100,000 Residents > 119.99 105 - 119.99 90 - 104.99 75 - 89.99< 75Figure 3.2 Hospitalization rates attributable to substance use by HSDA in BC in 201120 to Tobacco, 2011BC Health Service Delivery AreasHospitalization Rates Attributable to Alcohol, 2011 BC Health Service Delivery AreasHospitalization Rates Attributable to Illicit Drugs, 2011 BC Health Service Delivery Areas 11 121314 21525153 T able of Content MORBIDITY 32 YBC DOAP REPORT 2014 Y In 2011, among substance-related hospitalizations, most are due to cardiovascular conditions and injury/overdose. Figure 3.3 shows tobacco use was associated with the highest hospitalization rate by cardiovascular events, pulmonary, and cancer. Alcohol contributes most to injury/overdose, mental health, and a third of cancer hospitalizations attributable to substance use. Hospitalizations related to illicit drug use were mostly due to mental health reasons, injury/overdose, and other (e.g. HCV , HIV). 20 Adverse health conditions resulting from the use of tobacco and alcohol are higher in males and as they may take years to manifest, rates are higher in the 65+ age group.

Between 2008 and 2011, 22.6% of V ancouver and 32% of Victoria ED attendees self-reported moderate or high risk alcohol consumption in the previous year (Figure 3.4a and 3.4b). In both V ancouver and Victoria, nearly one-quarter of ED attendees reported moderate or high risk cannabis use, about 5% reported moderate or high risk cocaine and amphetamines use, and approximately 1% in both sites reported moderate risk use of opioids in the past year, with no reports of high risk use. 20 It should also be noted that St Paul's Hospital is the closest to, and most used ED by residents of DTES of V ancouver. 0 Non-fatal Overdoses Overdoses experienced and witnessed in the last six months in the combined VIDUS and ACCESS cohorts are shown in Figure 3.5 and in the ARYS cohort in Figure 3.6. In 2013, the proportion of youth who self-reported overdose was double that of the VIDUS/ACCESS cohorts (17.8% and 8.9% respectively); however the proportion who witnessed an overdose was similar 23% and 24% respectively.

The proportion of respondents who reported overdosing in the last six months was highest in VIHA (18%) and FHA (17%). More than a third of all participants reported witnessing an overdose in the previous six months; FH was highest at 50%. 21 CARBC's High Risk Populations Survey provides self-reported overdose events in past 12 months among recreational-use adults, street-involved adults, and street-involved youth in V ancouver and Victoria (Figure 3.8 and Figure 3.9, respectively). For both cities, overdoses among recreational-use adults are considerably higher than the other two at-risk populations surveyed. Among street-involved youth in both cities, there was a considerable decline in reported overdoses from 2011 through 2012. Available data for Victoria shows that this decline continues into 2014. The most recent data for both cities identify street-involved adults had the lowest prevalence of self-reported overdose. 18Percentage FH VCH VIHA IH NHFigure HR clients reporting overdose and witnessed overdose events in the last six months by HA, weighted by HSDA population, 201321 60 1750 1326 1836 1031 Overdosed months Witnessed overdose in last 6 monthsOverdose event: Overdosed by accident i.e. where you had a negative reaction from using too much drugs (CARBC, personal communication, July 9, 2014)Figure 3.8 Overdose events in the last twelve months among high-risk populations in Vancouver.20 Percentage35 30 25201510 50 2008 2009 2010 2011 2012 Recreational Adults Street-Involved Adults Street-Involved YouthOverdose event: Overdosed on any drug i.e. where you had a negative reaction from using too much drugs including alcoholJBack to T able of Content MORBIDITY 36 YBC DOAP REPORT 2014 Y T able 3.1 summarizes the overdoses witnessed and experienced from the different data sources and the corresponding time period.

These populations should be targeted with appropriate edu cation to reduce the risk of serious harms of overdose. The Public Health Surveillance Unit (PHSU) at VCH monitors injuries and overdoses using data from VCH emergency departments (EDs). 43 Figure 3.10 shows the number of ED visits related to overdose by substance type in the VCH region, based on the epidemiological week in 2013. This data summarizes over-dose visits to the ED of 9 of 13 VCH acute care facilities . VCH experienced overall more overdose episodes in 2013 compared to the historical average, with alcohol as the main cause for patient ED visits. Combination of heroin and other known drugs also represent about a quarter of overdose visits to ED. There is also a noticeable pattern of overdose events within the week that social assistance and disability cheques are issued; the highest monthly overdose rates occur either during this week or the following week.

The ingestion poisoning code is used when the call is thought to be caused by any toxic substance, such as prescribed and over the counter medication, street drug, or chemical. Figure 3.12 illustrates ingestion poisoning counts for BC in 2013. Call data is not confirmed by the responding ambulance crew; the historical average is based on 2004-2012.Weekly ingestion poisoning counts for BC in 2013 were lower than the historic average, with the exception of week 39 where ingestion poisonings surpassed the historical average. Both FH and VIHA had counts consistently below their historic averages. For VCH, weeks 39 and 47 were higher than the region's historical averages. In comparison, the 2013 counts for IH and NH repeatedly exceeded historical averages, on 12 and 13 weeks respectively (data not shown), and also approached or surpassed historical maximums on several occasions. Ingestion poisoning counts are received by BC CDC weekly from BCAS, reported by health authority, health service delivery area and local health area and shared on the password protected DOAP website.

FH had the largest call volume, but VIHA had the highest rate of nursing service calls when adjusted for population size. In over a third of all calls the region was unknown, so it is difficult to make conclusions regarding the geographic distribution of the calls.The largest call volumes for alcohol and drugs occurred between 6:00pm and 2:00am; and call volumes on Saturday and Sunday (18.8% and 19.4% of all calls respectively) were higher than the weekday average (12.4%). Figure 3.14 shows the number of calls in 2013 by month. October and January had the highest call volumes (above 500) while June had the lowest (less than 400). Caller age is recorded but this is not necessarily the person who needed information/assistance. The data do not classify the substance type related to each call.

In BC, emergency medical assistants at licence level 3 or higher are trained and authorized to administer naloxone. All BC Ambulance paramedics are appropriately trained and can administer naloxone. However, most firefighters are level 1 (first responder) or level 2 (Emergency medical responder) and thus are unable to administer naloxone. Figure 3.15 shows the number of events where naloxone was delivered by BC ambulance service crews from 2009 through 2013. If a patient received more than one dose of naloxone it was counted as a single event. These data suggest naloxone events increase in the summer months. Province-wide, the months with the highest 5-year average of naloxone events were in May (188), June (194.4), July (194.6) and August (187.2). The increase in summer months may be due to more frequent opioid use or increased drug use in outdoor and public settings and therefore more likely to be observed and for an ambulance to be called. T able 3.4 displays naloxone events by region, from 2009 through 2013. The overall number of naloxone events reported in 2009 is lower than those given in the subsequent four years. This may be partially attributed to the paramedic strike that lasted from April through November 2009. Ambulance administered naloxone events in BC peaked in 2011 (the year that overdose deaths due to increased heroin potency were also noted see chapter 5) with 2,242 events, and decreased subsequently reaching 2,011 in 2013. The reduction of administered naloxone follows the same trend of decreasing ingestion poisoning counts depicted in Figure 3.12. Figure 3.16 shows the rate of ambulance administered naloxone by HA. Note that IH had the highest rate at 57.4 events per 100,000 population in 2011 while VCH had the highest rate in 2013 at 56.3 events per 100,000 people.

V ancouver has the highest (83.7 per 100,000), which may reflect the prevalent drug use in the Downtown East Side and willingness to call 911. PWUD may be concerned about calling an ambulance if the police routinely arrive; in V ancouver, the V ancouver Police Department (VPD) has a policy to only attend situations where assistance is re quested by ambulance dispatch services.46 More information on naloxone can be found in the harm reduction chapter of this report. Severe neutropenia (agranulocytosis) associated with levamisole in cocaine In 2008, cases of severe neutropenia (low white blood cells) were identified in BC and Alberta associated with the use of cocaine which contained levamisole (a de-worming medication no longer available in Canada). 47 Cases of neutropenia in BC presented with bacterial or fungal infections and fever, which led to hospitalizations. A reporting system was implemented in BC which identified 51 cases of neutropenia associated with levamisole in cocaine between 2008 and 2011. Studies of levamisole-associated neutropenia suggest a genetic predisposition to adverse- drug events. Levamisole in cocaine was also associated with necrosis of the earlobes and face. 47 16.4 - 31.1 31.2 - 42.042.1 - 60.060.1 - 83.8Rate per 100,000 population by HSDA HSDA Rate Cases 11 14 Thompson Cariboo Shuswap 38.6 84 21 Fraser East 36.2 10422 Fraser North 30.3 193HSDA Rate Cases 23 Fraser South 38.9 29831 Richmond 16.4 3332 Vancouver 83.7 550 33 North Shore/Coast Garibaldi 20.7 58 41 South Vancouver Island 41.2 153 42 Central Vancouver Island 52.7 138HSDA Rate Cases 43 North Vancouver Island 39.5 47 51 Northwest 33.1 24 52 Northern Interior 46.5 6653 Northeast 28.8 20 (BC Ambulance Service, personal communication, May 21, 2014)N Figure 3.17 Rate of naloxone events per 100,000 population in BC by HSDA, 2013 25 km30.021.0 58.838.6 36.220.7 km45 YBC DOAP REPORT 2014 Y CHAPTER 4 CHAPTER 4 HIV AND HEPA TITIS C 0 HIV HIV BACKGROUND Human Immunodeficiency Virus (HIV) was identified over 30 years ago. Left untreated, HIV will lead to acquired immuno- deficiency syndrome (AIDS). Untreated individuals become increasingly susceptible to opportunistic infections such as pneumonia, cytomegalovirus, tuberculosis, and various cancers. HIV is transmitted through contact of infected blood, semen, vaginal fluid, or breast milk through mucous membrane, abraded skin, or needle penetration. HIV is most frequently transmitted through anal and vaginal sex, and needle sharing. The virus can also be passed from mother to child, either during pregnancy/delivery or through infected breast milk .1 Once considered a terminal illness, HIV is now regarded as a chronic illness. A 20-year-old HIV-positive individual taking appropriate doses of antiretroviral treatment (ART) can survive through his/her early 70s. Even though there is no cure for HIV , ART can prevent the replication of the virus and suppress the viral load to undetectable levels. This improves the health of the infected individual, as well as minimizing the risk of spreading the infection. 48 Even though HIV is treatable today, it is estimated that 27% of HIV infected individuals in Canada do not know their infection status (not tested or not received their result).49 The BC Centre for Excellence's Seek and Treat for Optimal Prevention of HIV/AIDS (STOP HIV/AIDS) project has expanded HIV testing, treatment, and support services. 50 STOP HIV/AIDS was implemented initially in NH and VCH in 2010, but was expanded in 2013 to include all health regions in BC. 50 This program has led to an increase in HIV testing and increased identification of HIV cases. HIV TREND There are approximately 1.3 million people living with HIV (PLHIV) in North America; 71,300 of these cases are in Canada. 51,52 BC is estimated to have 11,700 HIV-positive individuals, which comprises 16.4% of those infected in Canada.6 Newly identified HIV cases in BC have declined considerably since 2004 (Figure 4.1). In 2010/11, the BC rate was lower than the Canadian rate for the first time. In 2012 BC reported its lowest annual diagnosis count (237); but this subsequently increased in 2013. This increase may reflect the expanded testing.

However most HSDAs outside the BC lower mainland had less than15 cases reported in 2012 so HIV incidence rates may be unstable. 0.0 - 1.4 2.0 - 3.75.3 - 5.519.1Rate per 100,000 population by HSDA HSDA Rate Cases 11 East Kootenay 2.5 2 12 Kootenay Boundary 3.7 313 Okanagan 1.4 5 14 Thompson Cariboo Shuswap 0.9 2 21 Fraser East 2.1 622 Fraser North 3.2 20HSDA Rate Cases 23 Fraser South 2.6 1931 Richmond 2.0 432 Vancouver 19.1 131 33 North Shore/Coast Garibaldi 2.4 7 41 South Vancouver Island 3.7 14 42 Central Vancouver Island 3.0 8HSDA Rate Cases 43 North Vancouver Island 3.3 4 51 Northwest 5.3 452 Northern Interior 5.5 853 Northeast 0 0NFigure 4.3 New HIV diagnosis in BC by Content HIV AND HEPA TITIS C 48 YBC DOAP REPORT 2014 Y HIV AND ABORIGINAL POPULATIONS According to Statistics Canada census data Aboriginal peoples comprise 5% of the BC population, but in 2003 they represented 16.2% of newly diagnosed HIV cases; this proportion reduced to 12.6% in 2012. From 2003 to 2012, between 29 and 60 HIV cases per year were reported among First Nations people and ten or fewer cases annually in people who identified M\u00e9tis or Inuit her-itage. In 2012, there were 29 HIV diagnoses among First Nations people; 18 males, 11 females; 18 (62.1%) were in VCH and 5 (17.2%) in NH. Rates of HIV diagnosis in both First Nations women and men (15.9 and 26.8 per 100,000) exceed those of women and men of all other ethnicities (1.2 and 9.1 per 100,000) in BC. The highest rate of new HIV diagnosis among First Nations people by age group is 30-39 years for men (61.0 per 100,000) and 25-29 years for women (53.6 per 100,000). 55 HIV AND EXPOSURE CATEGORY Figure 4.5 shows new HIV cases by exposure category in BC. It is notable that while injection drug use (IDU) was the most predominant mode of infection in the 1990's, MSM now comprise the largest group of new HIV cases followed by heterosexual contact. 1 Since 2007 there has been a rapid decline in infection rates in people who identify as injection drug users. Despite the increase in HIV diagnosis from 2012 to 2013, detection among PWID remained stable within that timeframe (29 cases for each year).Sex distribution of BC cases is shown in Figure 4.4. Overall, there has been a steady decrease in HIV rate in both sexes, but males continue to exhibit much higher (5-10 times) infection rates compared to females. This is largely explained by higher rates among men who have sex with men (MSM).

This can be explained by several factors including: 1) the expansion of provincial harm reduction programs such as safer injection supply distribution, methadone maintenance programs and the supervised injection site in Vancouver; 2) the shift from injection drugs to non-injection drugs, which has a lower risk of HIV transmission when sharing paraphernalia; and 3) the expanded uptake of and adherence to ART which is associated with a reduction in the community viral load. These public health prevention programs have contributed to the reduction in HIV associated with injection drug use and should be sustained and expanded. 55 200 180160140 120 100 80 604020 0Figure 4.5 New HIV diagnoses in BC by exposure category, 2003-201354 2003 2004 2005 2006 2007 2008 2009 2010 2011 2012 2013* 181 160 173 181 153 153 170 149 150 158 188 125 115 118 65 64 52 34 29 29 136 137 82 73 90 81 92 83 75 52 60 105 104 8 11 7 7 12 6 7 2 12 5 9 4 2 3 11 16 6 2 5 21 4 4 MSM > men who have sex with men IDU > injection drug use HET > heterosexual contact NIR > no identified risk UNK > exposure unknown Other > blood/blood products, occupied perinatal, and other exposures *2013 BC diagnoses and BC rates are preliminary and subject to change (BCCDC Clinical Prevention Services Division, personal communication, May 13, 2014)MSM IDU HET Other NIR/UNK Number of DiagnosesJBack to T able of Content HIV AND HEPA TITIS C 50 YBC DOAP REPORT 2014 Y Research from UHRI shows after 15 years of follow-up unstably housed PWID were nearly twice as likely to become infected with HIV compared to PWID with stable housing (22% and 11.6% respectively) (Figure 4.6). 18 HIV TREATMENT Although there is no cure or vaccine available for HIV today, ART can improve and maintain the health of PLHIV and prevent the spread of infection. Improving HIV testing through healthcare services is a crucial step to ensuring ART success. In 2010 BC adopted the pilot STOP HIV/AIDS program in V ancouver's DTES and NH; in 2013 the program was implemented as an official pro vincial five-year program. The STOP HIV/AIDS program aims to expand HIV testing, treatment, and support services to clinically eligible individuals in BC, and places an emphasis on engaging hard-to-reach. 50 Since the implementation of this program, BC's HIV testing rate has rapidly increased, especial ly in VCH, as illustrated in Figure 4.7. In V ancouver, which has the highest concentration of HIV cases in BC, the expanded uptake is asso ciated with a lower community viral load among all HIV positive patients (Figure 4.8).57Unstable housing Stable housing p = 0.002120% 15% 10% 5% 0% 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15Cumulative incidence of HIV infection Time for enrolment (years)Figure 4.6 Cumulative incidence of HIV infection among PWID in Vancouver, 1996-2011, stratified by housing status57HIV Testing episodes per 100,000 populationFigure 4.7 Rate of HIV testing in BC and HAs, 2009-201358 9000 80007000600050004000300020001000 0 2009 2010 2011 2012 2013 FH VCH VIHA IH NH BC 51 YBC DOAP REPORT 2014 Y CHAPTER 4 Successful treatment outcomes for PLHIV depend on measures to keep viral levels suppressed. These stages of HIV-care can be summarized as follows: 1) HIV diagnosis, 2) Linkage to HIV care, 3) Retention in HIV care, 4) T aking ART and 5) Achieving a suppressed viral load. An interruption between any of these stages can lead to an increase in viral load and risk of HIV transmission. VCH and FH maintained relatively higher levels of HIV suppression in 2013, with over 60% of HIV diagnosed individuals successfully suppressing HIV to undetectable levels; but this suppression rate was below 40% in NH. Individuals with a history of IDU demonstrate lower success rates in maintain-ing HIV suppression (56.9%) compared to non-IDU individuals (69.3%). Success rates are much lower for individuals who do not identify their IDU status (28.3%) 57WestsideCity Centre SouthMidtownNorth EastDTESNorth Vancouver RichmondWestsideCity Centre RichmondVancouver local health areas, since STOP HIV/AIDS July 1, 2010 to current.

Although the total provincial AIDS rate has declined over the last decade, this reduction is not apparent within First Nations subpopulations. This indicates that more resources and strategies for culturally appropriate HIV education and awareness for health promotion and prevention need to be implemented. In addition a focus on reducing stigma and increasing culturally appropriate services and screening to reduce the transmission of HIV would be appropriate. Making early testing, treatment, and care more accessible to this community could help prevent HIV opportunistic infections and progression to AIDS. Barriers for Aboriginal people to access and benefit from health services include stigma, geographic isolation, poverty, racism, issues of confidentiality and other social and systemic barriers. 54 Community ownership and control of HIV and hepatitis C initiatives are essential. Including health care team members, such as Community Health Representatives and Nurses from First Nations communities, in the circles of care in the Regional Health Authorities will foster meaningful engagement and bridge the gaps in the leaky HIV prevention and care cascade for First Nations people living in BC. In 1997, about one person died of AIDS every day on the AIDS ward at St. Paul's Hospital in V ancouver and there were insufficient beds to care for these patients. 59 In May 2014, St. Paul's Hospital closed its AIDS ward citing that there were not enough AIDS patients to require its continued use. 59,60Rate per 100,000 populationFigure 4.9 AIDS diagnosis rate in BC, 1983-201254* 12 10 86 4 2 0 1983 1984198519861987198819891990199119921993199419951996199719981999 2000 2001 2002 2003 2004 2005 2006 2007 20082009 2010 2011 2012 *2013 rates are not available.

About 2% of the world's population (150 million people) are infected with chronic HCV .61 However, HCV prevalence among PWID globally is estimated to be 51% (7.2 million people). 62 About 250,000 Canadians are thought to be infected with HCV , including 21% who are unaware of their infec tion until symptoms appear.63,64 T o date approximately 75,000 people in BC have been diagnosed with HCV since 1992; 1.5% of the BC population 60,000 are estimated to be currently living with HCV . 65 HCV is primarily transmitted through exposure to infectious blood. 60 Before HCV testing was introduced in 1992, HCV was transmitted through blood transfusions and organ transplants1. Sharing HCV-exposed needles/syringes and other injecting equipment (e.g. water, cooker, filter) during intravenous drug preparation and use is the most common risk factor for HCV infection. HCV is more easily transmitted than HIV through needle sharing, which explains its high prevalence among PWID. 66 Sharing drug snorting and smoking paraphernalia such as straws and crack pipes may also transmit HCV but less efficiently than injection. 1 The risk of HCV transmission through vaginal and anal sex increases with multiple partners, STI co-infection, HIV infection, and traumatic sex. 1 T attooing, piercing, pedicure, manicure, medical procedures with unsterilized tools, and sharing of personal hygiene items are also linked to HCV infection. 63 HCV may be transmitted vertically, from an infected mother to her child during birth in 2-5% of cases but is much higher if mother is co-infected with HIV; transmission through breast-feeding has not been established. 1 The incubation period for HCV is 2 weeks to 6 months (usually 6-9 weeks), but most (80%) infected individuals do not experience symptoms of acute HCV infection - including fever, fatigue, de-creased appetite, nausea, abdominal pain and jaundice. 62 About 25% of infections resolve (clear the virus) within several months of infection. 67 Thus the majority of HCV cases develop chronic hepatitis C, which can lead to cirrhosis (up to 20% of chronic HCV cases over 20 years) or liver cancer (up to 6% of chronic HCV cases). 62 1-5% of chronic HCV patients die from cirrhosis or liver cancer following 20-30 years of disease progression.62,68 HCV infection is diagnosed by identifying antibodies against HCV (anti-HCV) using an enzyme immunoassay (EIA). 69 However, this does not differentiate individuals who have cleared the virus (spontaneously or through HCV treatment) from those who are chronically infected. Chronic HCV infection is identified by nucleic acid test (NA T), which detects the presence of HCV RNA (the genetic component of the virus). In BC, the Public Health Microbiology Reference Laboratory performs the majority (95%) of anti-HCV testing, as well as all HCV RNA and genotype test ing.69 Although there is no HCV vaccine available, HCV treatment can eradicate the virus. Treatment success depends on which of the six HCV genotypes an individual is infected with. According to the BC Laboratory Information System, 63% of HCV tested in BC are genotype 1, 36% genotype 2 and 3, and 1% genotype 4, 5 and 6. 1 Pegylated Interferon- and ribavirin combination therapy is currently the main treatment available in BC today: The sustained virological response (SVR), (i.e. no detectable virus six months after treatment completed) for genotype 2 and 3 is 80% but about 40-50% for the other genotypes with this current treatment. In 2011, \"triple therapy\" i.e. a Direct- Acting-Antiviral (DAA) protease interferon-ribavirin therapy was shown to improve SVR for genotype 1 patients up to 75% using reduced duration of the therapy. 70,71 HCV treatment is rapidly evolving and it is predicted that within five years, oral treatments with 90% cure rates and minimal side-effects will be available. 73 Boceprevir and telaprevir, the first DAA agents for HCV in Canada.72 Interferon-free regimens using sofosbuvir and ribavirin have also been found effective. These new treatments are reported to have fewer side-effects but are expensive, potentially costing more than $65,000 per complete course. 73 HCV TREND Newly identified HCV cases are reportable to public health by the laboratory. Although newly reported HCV cases in BC have steadily declined since the 1997 peak, BC still has the highest HCV rate in Canada (see Figure 4.10). Reported cases of HCV include both recent infections and remote infections (past infections that were identified recently). 74 The increase in HCV cases identified in 2013 coincides with an increase in HCV testing (Figure 4.11). As of 2013, over 2 million HCV tests have been performed in BC. Figure 4.11 shows the number of annual anti-HCV tests performed in BC in relation to the annual number of detected HCV cases. V arious local (STOP HIV/AIDS) and international (2012 US CDC guidelines advising HCV testing for persons born between 1945 and 1965 ) testing initiatives have contributed to an increase in awareness and testing, and subsequent increase of cases detected.JBack to T able of Content HIV AND HEPA TITIS C 54 YBC DOAP REPORT 2014 Y Figure 4.10 HCV rates by year in Canada and BC, 2004-201353 2004 2005 2006 2007 2008 2009 2010 2011 2012 2013* BC Hepatitis C Reports BC Hepatitis C Rate Canadian Hepatitis C Rate100 80 60 4020 43.8 41.5 45.9 45.2 40.3 36.9 36.6 35.8 33.3 31.1 28.9 19.3 0.0 *2013 Canadian rates are not available. 2013 BC diagnoses and BC rates are preliminary and subject to change (BCCDC Communicable Disease Prevention and Control Services, personal communication, May 22, 2014) 200 225000 200000175000150000125000100000 750005000025000 0160 120 80 40 01992 1993 1994 199519961997 1998 1999 2000 20012002 2003 20042005 2006 2007 2008 2009 2010 2011 2012 2013HCV RateNumber of Tests HCV Rate per 100,000 population Number of Tests *2013 BC rates are preliminary and subject to change (BCCDC Clinical Prevention Services Division, personal communication, June 19, 2014)Figure 4.11 Total anti-HCV test volumes and HCV cases, 1992-2013, YBC DOAP REPORT 2014 Y CHAPTER 4 When HCV rates were mapped by HSDA for 2013 (Figure 4.12); Fraser East had the highest HCV rate, followed by Northern Interior, V ancouver, and North V ancouver Island. Richmond, Northeast, and North Shore have the lowest rates. Based on age group (Figure 4.13), HCV rates peak in males in the 40-59 age group, but females have higher rates of HCV than males at younger ages. Women generally use health services more frequently than men and are thus more likely to be tested, and HCV detected. Males dominate the HCV cases after age 30. The highest male rate is in the 40-59 age group when it is over twice the female rate, which reflects the age and sex of PWID in BC.

The Public Health Agency of Canada considers seroconversion within 12 months as an acute HCV case; however, 24 month seroconversion can give a clearer picture of new infections, and is a useful indicator for tracking HCV diagnosis. 72 Figure 4.14 illustrates the trend of 12 and 24 month seroconversions among repeat testers in BC. The overall declining trend in rate of HCV seroconversions detected per 1,000 testers continued into 2013.Anti-HCV seroconversion rates have declined in all health regions since 2000; laboratory data for 2013 indicate that 24 month seroconversion rates were similar in all HAs (Figure 4.15). IH has the highest rate (3.48 per 1,000 testers) and FH has the lowest (2.60 per 1,000 testers). However, 24 month serocon-version rates in VIHA may be underestimated because HCV negative test results performed at Victoria General Hospital are unavailable for inclusion in this analysis.125 100 75 50 25 0Rate per 100,000 populationFigure 4.13 HCV rate in BC by Reports - Female Hepatitis C Reports - Male Hepatitis C ReportsHepatitis C Rate - Female Hepatitis C Rate - MaleHepatitis C Rate9.4 0.0 0.0 0.9 12.6 40.8 62.1 41.6 45.4 23.0 4.4 2.2 0.0 0.0 3.4 28.5 44.0 76.9 107.4 59.5 *2013 BC diagnoses and BC rates are preliminary and subject to change (BCCDC Communicable Disease Prevention and Control Services, personal communication, May 22, 2014)6.8 1.1 0.0 0.4 7.8 34.4 53.1 59.1 76.1 40.3 2 0 0 1 17 62 97 127 309 126 1 2 0 0 5 46 68 231 714 296 3 2 0 1 22 108 165 358 1024 42257 YBC DOAP REPORT 2014 Y CHAPTER 4 Figure 4.14 HCV seroconversions per 1000 repeat testers, British Columbia, 2000-2013 2000 2001 2002 2003 2004 2005 2006 2007 2008 2009 2010 2011 2012 repeat testersRepeat Testers All Sero 24 mon sero 12 mon sero (BCCDC Clinical Prevention Services Division, personal communication, June 19, 2014) 25 20 15 10 5 0Figure 4.15 Anti-HCV seroconversion rate by HA, 2000-2013.

Increased time exposed to IDU and increased frequency of injection (e.g. cocaine with a short half-life may lead to frequent injections), requiring assistance for injecting and co-infection with HIV are associated with increased risk of HCV infection. 64 It is estimated that 48% of people who previously injected drugs are infected with HCV . 64 HCV estimated prevalence in various subgroups is shown in Figure 4.16. Prevalence of HCV in PWID varies; 69% in I-Track 2005-2008 in Canadian in Victoria, BC HCV prevalence in PWID is 83-88% of PWID in V ancouver's DTES. 64,75 Although IDU is strongly linked to HCV infection, social determinants of health, such as income, social status, housing, education, and healthcare accessibility are additional factors that can shape HCV risk behaviour. Further-more, stigma can be a deterrent to HCV testing, which increases the risk of transmitting the infection. 73 An Australian study found that after adjusting for the broader social determinants of health, none of the individual risk factors (e.g. needle and syringe sharing) had a significant link to HCV infection. 76 Hence, the need for interventions aimed at improving the broader social determinants of health in addition to harm reduction activities.

Prevalence of HCV among established PWID is high; therefore few are susceptible to new HCV infection. 75 In Canada, 50-90% of HIV-positive PWID are also infected with HCV; in BC, 64% of co-infected males and 73% of co-infected females are PWID. 77, 78 Early initiation of HCV treatment for co-infected individuals can postpone or prevent the development of serious liver problems. About half of co-infected individuals in BC were diagnosed with HCV an average 3.5 years prior to their HIV infection. 79 HIV incidence rate HCV incidence rateRate per 100 person-yearsFigure 4.17 Incidence of HIV HCV infection among PWUD in Vancouver, 1996-201118 199640 353025201510 50 1997 1998 1999 2000 2001 2002 2003 2004 2005 2006 2007 2008 2009 2010 2011JBack to T able of Content MORTALITY 60 YBC DOAP REPORT 2014 Y CHAPTER 5 MORTALITY The BC Vital Statistics Agency is responsible for the ascer- tainment, registration and certification of vital events. It identifies the causes of death according to the World Health Organization's International Classification of Diseases (ICD-10) coding system which has been used since 2000. Death statistics summarize events by calendar year that occurred in the province of BC. Selected vital statistics and health status indicators are reported by Local Health Authority (LHA) in the BC Vital Statistics Agency Annual Report 2011. 11 In 2011 the total number of deaths in BC from all causes was 31,776, of these 371 (1.17%) were coded as drug-induced deaths. This percentage had remained stable over the previous 5-year period (2006-2010). The majority of drug-induced deaths in BC are attributed to accidental poisoning by drugs, accounting for 71.2% of drug-induced deaths. This classification includes not only illicit drugs, but also prescription and over-the-counter drugs. However, it excludes causes indirectly related to drug use such as HIV , HCV , sepsis or motor vehicle accidents. Suicide by drugs accounts for the second largest cause (22.1%) of drug-induced deaths. The distribution of causes of drug-induced deaths is shown in T able 5.1.The standardized mortality ratio (SMR) is the ratio of the observed number of deaths in a population to the number of expected deaths. SMR is often used to illustrate health inequal-ities and excess deaths due to drug use in different geographic regions. Figure 5.1 shows the SMR due to drug-induced deaths throughout BC by Local Health Areas (LHA) in 2011. Figure 5.2 shows SMR in V ancouver LHAs. Statistically significant excess number of deaths was found in V ancouver Island North, Camp-bell River, Cariboo-Chilcotin, South Cariboo, Kamloops, Merritt, Penticton, Mission and V ancouver Downtown East Side. In 2011, the observed drug-induced deaths in the V ancouver Downtown East Side Community Health Area 2 (CHA2) were almost 5 times the provincial rate; whereas the V ancouver Westside (CHA4) had a significantly lower number of deaths compared to the provincial rate. The other CHAs in the V ancouver HSDA were not significantly different compared to all of BC. Compared to previous years, the standardized mortality ratio in the Downtown East Side has declined from 7.36 in 2005 to 4.97 in 2011, but remained significantly higher than the provincial SMR.

All rates were standardized by age and sex using the 2001 BC population over 15 years of age as the standard. Mortality rates attributable to substance use declined for the period 2002-2011, although the decline is more substantial for tobacco than for alcohol and illicit drugs. As shown in Figure 5.3, death rates attributable to illicit drugs are lower than death rates attributed to alcohol and tobacco use. 20Figure 5.4 shows mortality rates attributable to illicit drug use for each HA and for the whole province. VIHA consistently has the highest death rate related to drug use, although the rate shows a downward trend. The rate in NH reached its highest peak in 2010; rates in NH show the greatest variability but may be unstable due to small numbers. The highest decline in death rate was recorded in VCH, falling from 11 per 100,000 in 2005 to 6.26 cases per 100,000 residents in 2011. 20Rate per 100,000 population12 11 10 9 8 7 6 5 4 FH VCH VIHA IH NH BC2002 2003 2004 2005 2006 2007 2008 2009 2010 2011Figure 5.4 Mortality rates related to illicit drugs for BC and health authorities, 2002-201120Figure 5.3 Death rates related to substance use in BC, 2002-201120 120 106 26 887 23 7 2002 2003 2004 2005 2006 2007 2008 2009 2010 2011100 80 604020 0 Tobacco Alcohol Illicit drugsRate per 100,000 populationJBack to T able of Content MORTALITY 64 YBC DOAP REPORT 2014 Y In 2011, there were eight HSDAs with death rates attributable to illicit drug use higher than the provincial rate i.e. above 7 per 100,000 (see figure 5.5).

The cause of death is established based on the information collect ed during investigation at the scene of death and information gath ered from history, autopsy and toxicology results. A post-mortem examination (autopsy) may be required when the cause of death cannot otherwise be determined. An autopsy may not be required if a reasonable and probable cause of death can be deduced on the basis of the deceased's medical history, the circumstances surrounding the death and a careful examination of the body. T oxicological examination may be required when abuse of street drugs is suspected. It can be performed at the Provincial T oxicology Centre or at the RCMP Forensic Laboratory if the case is part of criminal investigation. Screening tests for the most common drugs of abuse (ethanol, cannabinoids, cocaine, morphine, methadone, benzodiazepines) are followed by confirmatory tests. Screening for amphetamines/methamphetamines, LSD, PCP and other designer drugs may be done with specific requests based on history and lifestyle. 81 The BC Coroners Service provides monthly year-to-date illicit drug overdose death statistics, which are available to the Drug Overdose and Alert Partnership, on a password protected website. Deaths occurring in the previous 12 months may still be under investigation and should be considered provisional, thus previously reported data may change as cases are closed. Although subject to change, the information is useful to identify trends and sudden increases. Please note that the BC Coroners Service geographic regions differ from the Health Authority (HA) and Health Service Delivery Area (HSDA) boundaries, making data comparisons difficult. For example, the Coroner's Northern Region contains areas that belong to V ancouver Coastal (Bella Coola V alley) and Interior Health (Cariboo-Chilcotin and 100 Mile House). The Coroners Service shared provisional illicit drug overdose deaths between 2007 and 2012 including township. Sixteen communities had more than 20 deaths in that period. These communities were V ancouver (343), Surrey (182), Victoria (101), Burnaby (61), Kelowna (46), Kamloops (44), Abbotsford (42), Langley (29), Maple Ridge (28), Mission (27), New Westminster (27), Chilliwack (26), Prince George (25), Nanaimo (24), Vernon (22) and Coquitlam (21). 82 Illicit drug deaths reached a peak of 417 in BC in 1998 (191 of these in V ancouver). BC deaths were subsequently below 300 until 2011. Deaths in the City of V ancouver were relatively stable from 2004-2010. The rate of illicit drug deaths in 2013 in the City of V ancouver is higher than the rate in the rest of the province 11.4 per 100,000 in City of V ancouver, compared to 6.7 deaths per 100,000 in the rest of BC. A slight upward trend in the number and rate of illicit drug deaths has been observed in the past three years both in V ancouver and the rest of BC (Figure 5.6 and 5.7).

The greatest number of drug-induced deaths in males occurred in the 20-29 age group. This is a change from the previous report in 2007, which had the greatest number of fatalities in the 30-39 age group, suggesting a trend towards younger age of death. 0 Classification of Illicit Drug Deaths The large majority of illicit drug deaths are classified as accidental and this trend has been consistent since 2005. From 2005-2012, accidental illicit drug deaths accounted for about 90% of all illicit drug deaths. Suicide is determined on the balance of probabilities. The element of intent is a key defining characteristic of suicide (implicit, explicit, or both). The Coroner must be satisfied that the person intended to end his/her own life; thus a determination of suicide is made when there is clear and cogent evidence. A greater proportion of deaths remain undetermined in 2013 and 2014 as cases are still under investigation (Figure 5.10).Figure 5.9 Illicit drug deaths in BC by age and gender, 2013* 25.0 20.015.0 10.0 5.0 0.080 70605040302010 0 Number of deaths for females Number of deaths for males Rate per 100,000 for females Rate per 100,000 for males Number of deaths *Includes deaths that are still under investigation (BC Coroners Service, personal communication, October 3, 2014)Rates per 100,000 20 20-29 30-39 40-49 50-59 60-69 70-79 80+ 6 21 21 13 16 4 0 0 7 69 57 59 43 15 0 0 4.6 1.5 0.0 0.0 1.3 6.8 6.9 3.9 0.0 0.0 1.4 21.8 19.0 18.4 12.5 5.6JBack to T able of Content MORTALITY 68 YBC DOAP REPORT 2014 Y 0 Illicit Drug Deaths by Type of Drug Using data from BC Vital Statistics Agency, Figure 5.11 shows the ten-year trends in illicit drug overdose deaths from 2002 to 2011. Overdose deaths due to heroin/morphine declined 2006 to 2008, but have risen slightly since. Overdose deaths due to cocaine alone have declined steadily since 2004 but those due to mixed drugs and multiple narcotics (opioids) have generally increased over the past 5 years and remain the leading cause of death due to illicit drug overdose. 11 The illicit use of prescription drugs has been a long standing problem which has become more prominent in recent years with the appearance of illicit fentanyl on the street drug market. Illicit fentanyl is manufactured in clandestine laboratories and sold on the streets as oxycodone (fake oxy) pills or heroin powder. 39 Because of its higher potency, the risk of accidental overdose with fentanyl is much higher and may take larger doses of naloxone to reverse. There was an increase in fentanyl related deaths from 15 in 2012 to 51 in 2013, and 49 in first eight months of 2014. 40 More information about fentanyl can be found in the Drug Trends section.Figure 5.10 Illicit drug deaths in BC by classification, 2005-2014* 2005 2006 2007 2008 2009 2010 2011 2012 2013* 2014* Undetermined SuicideHomicide**Accidental5 5 5 1 7 5 10 11 23 12 9 5 10 6 8 12 20 12 8 6 1 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 225 222 199 179 195 206 278 261 299 211350 300 250 200 150 50100 0Number of deaths * Includes cases still under investigation; 2014 only includes deaths reported between January 1 and April 30 ** Death due to injury inflicted by the action of another person.

Deaths where illicit use of prescription drugs was implicated were excluded. The highest rate of overdose death due to prescription opioids was recorded in the Interior Health (2.8 per 100,000 population). Males and females are equally represented (51.1 vs. 48.9 %) with the highest number of deaths recorded in older age groups (40-59 years). In comparison to illicit drug overdose deaths (Figure 5.10), a greater proportion of deaths due to prescription drug overdose are classified as suicide as shown in Figure 5.12. 83Number of deaths *ICD-10 codes for psychostimulants include \"crystal \"ecstasy\"100 90 8070605040302010 0Figure 5.11 Illicit drug overdose deaths in BC by type of drug, 2002-201111 642008 406 832009 44 20 25 13 1 5 662010 44 8 26 306 772011 23 22 24 35 31 68 83 86 95 78JBack to T able of Content MORTALITY 70 YBC DOAP REPORT 2014 Y MORTALITY DUE TO PSYCHOSTIMULANT USE Psychostimulants in the BC Vital Statistics Agency Annual Report are defined as \"crystal methamphetamine\" and \"ecstasy\" , but in recent years these substances have appeared on the market unpurified and mixed with other substances. These substances include New Psychoactive Substances (NPS) such as piperazines and analogues of methcathinone and para- methoxymethamphetamine (PMMA), which are not routinely tested for in BC Coroners' investigations. 84 The BC Coroners Service reports illicit drug deaths where MDMA (ecstasy) is detected alone or in combination with other drugs and includes all deaths due to overdose and other causes (i.e. drowning, fall, carbon monoxide poisoning, aspiration, motor vehicle accidents). T able 5.4 shows the number of MDMA-related deaths for each Coroners Region from 2006 to 2012. 85 The BC Coroner's Office released a bulletin in January 2012 regarding deaths where PMMA was detected and it was implicated as the primary toxic agent causing death. Between August 2011 and April 2012 seven deaths were identified where PMMA was implicated in BC (3 males, 4 females; mean age was 22 years). In Alberta 20 PMMA implicated deaths were reported. Organ failure and serotonin syndrome, with very high temperature, seizures and unconsciousness occurred. In BC public health and law enforcement actively reached out to school and university populations, Dance Safe and online drug-user websites to inform potential users of ecstasy.Figure 5.12 Prescription opioid-related overdose deaths in BC by classification, 2005-201083Number of deaths90 80 70 60 50 40 30 20 10 02005 2006 2007 2008 2009 2010 Suicide Accidental32 26 25 26 20 18 32 44 45 51 50 453 5 1 2 4 9 Undetermined Table 5.4 MDMA-related deaths by coroners regions, 2006-201285 2006 2007 2008 2009 2011 2012 % 2010 Region Fraser InteriorIsland Metro Northern Total5 5 7 2 6 4 4 30.8 1 2 1 5 4 2 1 15.0- 3 1 5 5 3 1 16.8 - 3 11 6 3 5 5 30.8 1 - 3 3 - - - 6.5 7 13 23 21 18 14 11 10071 YBC DOAP REPORT 2014 Y CHAPTER 6 CHAPTER 6 HARM REDUCTION Harm Reduction (HR) is a philosophical and evidence-based approach that strives to keep people safe by minimizing death, disease, injury, and other adverse outcomes associated with high risk behaviour. HR includes a range of non-judgmental strategies that aim to improve knowledge, skills, resources, and supports for individuals, their families, and communities, in order to promote safety and better health. HR takes a partic - ipatory approach, and as such, people who use drugs (PWUD) are vital to planning and implementing successful programs. 1 HR not only benefits PWUD, but the community at large by minimizing the transmission of infectious disease. HR is internationally recognized and supported by the WHO. 86,87 V ancouver experienced a public health emergency in the 1990s, with the highest rate of HIV infection in the western world. The BC government supported HR strategies to deal with the epidemic. 87 The Harm Reduction Strategies and Services (HRSS) is comprised of representatives from the five regional Health Authorities, BCCDC, the First Nations Health Authority, the Health Officer's Council of BC, the BC Ministry of Health, and PWUD from across BC (peers). The HRSS collaboratively develops policies and guidelines with a vision to ensure that British Columbians have access to evidence-based HR strate gies and services.4,74 According to a 2011 BCCDC public telephone survey, 76% of British Columbians report they support HR. Females, younger age groups and persons with higher education are more likely to support HR activities. Fraser Health region has the lowest level of support at 71.5%. The survey found that established HR services such as needle distribution had more support than newer ones such as those related to inhalation equipment for crack-cocaine. 88 The following HR programs are implemented in BC today:89,90 - PEER SUPPORT PROGRAMS: Groups for people who use substances to improve their quality of life and to address gaps in services - NEEDLE DISTRIBUTION PROGRAMS: Distribute clean needles and other harm reduction supplies and educate on their safe disposal - OUTREACH AND EDUCATION: Make contact with people who use substances to encourage safer behaviour - SUBSTITUTION THERAPIES: Substitute illegal heroin with legal, non-injection methadone or prescription heroin - SUPERVISED INJECTION FACILITY (INSITE): Provides a safer, supervised environment for people using substances in V ancouver - TAKE HOME NALOXONE (THN) PROGRAM: Naloxone is an to opioid overdoses. THN program provides training and naloxone kits to people who use opioids. - IMPAIRED DRIVING PREVENTION CAMPAIGNS: Create awareness of the risks of driving under the influence of alcohol and other legal or illegal substancesJBack to T able of Content HARM REDUCTION 72 YBC DOAP REPORT 2014 Y 0 HR Supply Distribution Programs The transmission of blood-borne pathogens including HCV and HIV through sharing drug use equipment, such as needles, cookers, and water can be reduced by providing accessible sterile equipment. This includes male and female condoms, lubricant, needles and syringes, sterile water, acidifier (vitamin C), cookers with filters, tourniquets, alcohol swabs, sharps containers, vinyl tubing and cutters to produce crack pipe mouthpieces, crack pipe screens, and push sticks. Some of these are shown in Figure 6.1 74 BCCDC oversees the BC HR supply distribution. HR sites which receive supplies directly from provincial program (receiving sites) fax their supply order to the BCCDC who tracks supplies distributed to the 233 or so receiving sites across the province. Receiving sites may in turn provide supplies to other (satellite) sites to make available to clients. The following supply numbers are those distributed to receiv ing sites and are therefore an approximation of where supplies are obtained by clients. The HR sites in BC can be located online at the Toward the Heart. 74 SAFER SEX SUPPLIES T otal condom distribution for 2013 is presented in Figure 6.2. In 2013, 4,076,780 condoms were distributed in BC through HR supplies. VCH distributed the largest number of condoms. Few female-condoms are distributed although in drug-involved sexual situations, men often reject using condoms and pressure their female partners into unprotected sex. 91-93 A female condom can be inserted several hours prior to sexual intercourse, increasing a woman's capacity to protect herself during sex. 94 It is therefore important to make sure that female condoms are widely available and that women are informed about them.

The majority (97.6% in 2013) of syringes are 0.5ml and 1ml insulin syringes which include the needles. Separate needles and syringes are also provided as some drugs may be administered intramuscularly, be large volume or viscous such as steroids. About 63% of syringes (5,216,425), were provided to VCH, and of these about 65% (3,402,000) were distributed within V ancouver HSDA. The total number of syringes delivered to the supervised injection site (for use within InSite and as a distribution site) account for 33% (1,745,525) of the VCH total.

The horizontal lines represent the 2012 BC aver-age rate of syringe distribution per 100 population aged 15 years and older. This data illustrates the high rate of syringe distribu-tion in VCH, and more specifically, V ancouver HSDA. Despite a doubling of syringe distribution in FH from 2011 to 2013 (Figure 6.3), Fraser HA has a low syringe distribution rate compared to the other four HAs.

Sterile water in plastic ampoules avoids harms from using unsterile or contaminated sources such as puddle water. Best practice recommends a sterile water ampoule should be used with a sterile needle/syringe for each injection. In 2013, HRSS distributed 4,238,000 water ampoules throughout BC, which represents about half the number of syringes distributed (BCCDC Communicable Disease Prevention and Control Ser-vices, personal communication, May 6, 2014). Programs should strive to distribute as many water ampoules as required so the individual client can use a new sterile water ampoule and sterile needle/syringe for every injection. 74 Distribution of cookers and acidifiers in BC started in 2010. Cookers are used to mix and heat substances such as heroin or crack cocaine to dissolve them before injection; in the absence of cookers, unsterile teaspoons or beverage cans may be used. Providing sterile, disposable cookers decreases sharing and reduces the risk of transmitting blood-borne and bacterial infections from unsterile paraphernalia. Acidifiers are used to dissolve crack cocaine, brown tar heroin, or coated pharma-ceuticals for injection. Lemon juice or vinegar can cause pain and damage to the veins. The HR program provides single-use packets of medical grade vitamin C (ascorbic acid) powder. A tourniquet or 'tie' is an elasticated strip that is tied around the arm to help protrude veins to prevent disrupted blood flow, skin trauma, and other injection-related harms. Elastic, quick release tourniquets are preferable to a cord or belt which may be difficult to release and damage the vein. T ourniquets should not be shared as this can cause transmission of bacterial infections such as methicillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus (MRSA). Sharps containers are a safe and convenient means of dispos-ing of used injection and inhalation equipment. Their use helps reduce injection litter, avoid needle stick injuries, and prevent the spread of infection. 74 Figure 6.6 illustrates the overall distribution of cookers, acidifiers, tourniquets and sharps containers by HA in BC.

Providing safer inhalation equipment can reduce harms and increase engagement. Vinyl tubing is provided in 100ft lengths and is cut to create a mouth-piece, to attach to a glass stem. The mouthpiece avoids direct contact of the mouth and lips with hot or broken glass stems and to reduce the risk of oral lesions, and allows individuals to use their own mouthpiece to reduce the potential transmission of communicable diseases via shared glass stems. Wooden push sticks scrapes the residue from inside the glass stem (pipe), and avoids the inappropriate use of syringe plungers, or metal coat hangers and car aerials, which can melt or chip the glass stems. Crack pipe screens hold the crack cocaine 'rock' in place near the end of the pipe; these brass screens reduce the use of steel wool, which can breakdown so that hot metal particles are inhaled causing burns on the lips, mouth, and respiratory tract. 74Distribution of glass stems (crack pipes) is best practice in harm reduction programs. 95 The VCH Safer Smoking Pilot Project started in 2011 and provided safer smoking kits con-sisting of stems, other safer smoking supplies and educational materials to people in the DTES. 96 From December 2011 through November 2012, the pilot distributed 100,400 kits through five DTES HR service providers. 96 An evaluation found decreased smoking-related cuts, burns, and blisters among people who received the kits and statistically significant reductions in high risk behaviour such as obtaining used stems from the street. 96 Contrary to public concerns about the program, the increased availability of glass pipes in V ancouver was not found to encourage crack use; research by UHRI suggests that crack use among V ancouver area people who use illicit drugs has consistently declined since 2008 (Figure 2.8). Not surprisingly VCH distributed the most tubing, push sticks and screens in 2013. Harm reduction supply distribution in BC is inequitable between and within health authorities and should be addressed.

In 2013, among people who inject drugs, 2.5% of participants reported lending a used syringe in the previous six months; 5.6% reported borrowing a used syringe within the same timeframe, down from 40% of participants who reported lending or borrowing syringes in 1996. The substantial decline is likely multi-factoral: including the BC harm reduction program and local efforts, educational initiatives, the establishment of the supervised injection facility in V ancouver and an experienced surviving cohort. The CARBC Alcohol and Other Drug Monitoring project's high risk survey found street-involved adults from Victoria reported significantly more frequent sharing of needles or injecting equipment* compared to V ancouver participants (Figure 6.8). 20 Please note that CARBC 'needle sharing' includes both lending and borrowing. In BCCDC's 2013 HR client survey, 12% of respondents who had injected in the past week reported lending a used needle in the previous month; this proportion was highest in FH and VCH (14%), and lowest in IH (7%). 23 Furthermore, 8% of those who had injected in the past week indicated that they had injected with a used needle in the previous month; NH was highest at (12%) and IH (11%) and lowest in VIHA (7%). 23 However, among active youth injectors from the ARYS cohort prevalence of needle lending (13.1%) and needle borrowing (8.3%) in 2013 are higher than the adult population (Figure 6.9) indicating a need for appropriate harm reduction messaging for young injectors.

Compared to the adult UHRI cohort, rates in the high risk population and BCCDC HR client survey may be unstable due to small sample sizes. 20,23 Please also note that the time frame varies between studies. The BCCDC HR client survey found that about half of the respondents who inject drugs reported difficulty accessing new rigs (needles) in the previous month; the proportion varied by health authority. It should be noted that perception of difficulty accessing rigs may be influenced by expectations. The most cited barrier to obtaining new rigs in all five HAs was the supply distribution centre not being open when needed; other reported problems included the HR site being too far away and concerns about confidentiality. 23 Half of harm reduction clients report difficulty accessing needles/syringes. Adopting more flexible operating hours and creating mobile distribution sites may reduce some of the barriers to access. Needle/syringe borrowing and lending remains unacceptably high (10%). Strengthening awareness and peer-to-peer education regarding risks of needle sharing is needed.23FH q 57% VCH q q 33% Table 6.1 Needle/syringe lending and borrowing rates in BC, 201320,23 Study (Timeframe) Lending % Borrowing % Sharing % UHRI Vancouver Adults Past 6 Months** AOD Monitoring High Risk Adults VancouverPast 12 Months* AOD Monitoring High Risk Adults VictoriaPast 12 Months* HR Client Survey Adults VCH Past Month HR Client Survey Adults All BC Past Month UHRI Vancouver Youth Past 6 Months**2.5 5.6 - - - 4.3 - - 5.6 14 8 - 12 7.7 - 13.1 8.3 - * Sharing includes lending and borrowing.

Crack pipe sharing among street-involved adults in V ancouver was lower than in Victoria throughout the observed study period. It should be noted that crack smoking was more prevalent among V ancouver street-involved adults than Victoria street-involved adults during this timeframe. V ancouver's lower rates of pipe sharing may be partially attributable to the VCH Safer Smoking Pilot Project. 20 In 2013, half of HR client survey respondents reported difficulty acquiring crack pipes in the previous month, highest in VCH (59%), and lowest in VIHA (39%). However, V ancouver HR sites selected for the survey were not distributing crack pipes at the time, which may partially explain the higher percentages in VCH overall. Among survey participants, the most frequently reported alternative to crack pipes were pop cans (51%) and pipe sharing (50%). The majority (78%) of respondents reported borrowing crack pipes or mouthpieces in the previous month, while 61% indicated that they had lent a pipe or mouthpiece. The HR client survey asked about crack pipe disposal; the most frequently reported method of disposal was regular garbage (61%), followed by sharps container (21%), return to HR site (8%), and unspecified \"other\" (24%). More detailed regional comparisons of needle and crack pipe acquisition, disposal, and sharing behaviour can be obtained from the BCCDC website. 23 High rates of sharing crack pipes and mouthpieces (about 50%) were reported throughout BC, reflecting the general lack of availability of safer smoking supplies.Figure 6.10 Crack pipe sharing in the past 12 months among street-involved adults in Victoria and Vancouver, 2010-201320 100 66.7 51.180 60 40 2010 Wave 12010 Wave 22011 Wave 12011 Wave 22012 Wave 12013 Wave 220 0Percent Note: Data is only available for Vancouver upto 2012 wave 2Vancouver (n=349) Victoria (n=375)JBack to T able of Content HARM REDUCTION 82 YBC DOAP REPORT 2014 Y 0 Supervised Injection Site (InSite) InSite is the only sanctioned supervised injection facility (SIF) in North America. The BC Ministry of Health provides operational funding for InSite through VCH. Since opening in 2003, the facility has had more than 2 million visits. 97 In 2012, there were 376,149 visits to InSite by 9,259 unique individuals.97 VCH and the Portland Hotel Society (PHS) Community Services provide a comprehensive support network at InSite. PHS is a non-profit organization that promotes supportive affordable housing for V ancouver area individuals who are at increased risk of homelessness due to substance abuse and other mental health problems. InSite has 12 injection booths where clients inject pre-obtained illicit drugs under the supervision of nurses and health care staff. There were 1418 overdoses at InSite between 2004 and 2010, and staff successfully intervened each time. T o date there has been no fatality at InSite. In addition to nurses, InSite also has addictions counselors, mental health workers, and peer staff who connect clients to community resources such as housing, addictions treatment, and other supportive services. 97 Research shows that InSite reduced fatal overdose cases within 500 metres of the facility by 35% between 2001 and 2005, and may have prevented up to 51 overdose deaths between March 2004 and July 2007. 98-100 The SIF may have reduced needle sharing and increased condom use; these behavioural changes could translate to about $6 million in annual healthcare cost savings. 101-105 Peer-reviewed research demonstrates other health benefits that InSite has provided for the larger community. 106 - Only one person out of 1,065 reported performing their first injection at InSite, suggesting InSite has not promoted illicit drug injecting, but has attracted individuals with long histo-ries of injection drug use. 107 - Among more than 1,000 InSite visitors, 18% began a detoxi-fication program. There was a 33% increase in detoxification service use compared to the year preceding the opening of the facility. Individuals who used InSite at least weekly were 1.7 times more likely to enroll in a detox program than those who visited the centre less frequently. 108,109 - There is no evidence suggesting InSite is linked to an increase in drug-related crime activities in the surrounding area. 110 - The presence of InSite improved public order in the area around the facility; there w ere significant decreases in the number of publicly discarded syringes, injection-related litter such as syringe wrappers, and people injecting in the area around InSite. 111- Local police are actively referring PWID to InSite, signify- ing that InSite is providing an opportunity to coordinate policing and public health efforts. Police are helping to meet both public health and public order objectives and are playing an important role in supporting V ancouver's supervised injection site. This indicates a disconnect be-tween the views of local police officers working in direct proximity to InSite and those of external law enforcement organizations who remain vocally opposed to the facility. 112 0 T ake Home Naloxone (THN) Program Unintentional deaths from opioid overdose are preventable with overdose prevention, recognition, and response education including naloxone administration training. Naloxone, or Narcan\u00ae, has been used in emergency settings for over 40 years in Canada and is on the WHO List of Essential Medicines. It is a pure opioid antagonist that quickly (in 2-5 minutes) reverses life-threatening respiratory depression to restore breathing. Naloxone is not a controlled substance, it cannot be abused, and in the absence of opioids has no pharmacologic activity. Research also demonstrates that having naloxone available does not increase risk-taking behaviour. Naloxone can be given by injection (into the vein or muscle or under the skin) or intra-nasal (sprayed into the nose). Naloxone for injection is currently the only formulation approved by Health Canada and is a prescription only medication (POM). The intra-muscular injection can be given through clothing into the muscle of the upper arm, buttock, or upper leg. 90 Numerous THN programs exist globally, including more than 180 programs in the US, the first of which was established in 1996. 113 Edmonton started the first THN program in Canada in 2005, Toronto began in 2010 and in 2012 BC and Ontario launched provincial initiatives to provide naloxone education and kits. Ontario's program was implemented at harm reduction distribution sites but was put on hold for six months but recommenced in October 2013. 114 BC's Overdose Prevention Program is modeled on the successes of existing programs and combines education (overdose prevention, recognition, and response) with a THN kit for individuals who use opioids (legally prescribed or illegally obtained) and are at risk of an overdose. 90 Because 85% of overdoses happen in the company of others, having naloxone available offers the opportunity to save a life and reduce harms related to the overdose while waiting for the 83 YBC DOAP REPORT 2014 Y CHAPTER 6 paramedics to arrive. It is not intended to replace emergency care or minimize the importance of calling 911. Mathematical modeling in the US demonstrates that naloxone, in conjunction with overdose education, has a synergistic effect i.e. has greater effect on reducing overdose events than if each was provided individually. As shown in Figure 6.11, in 24 months, 2,214 people have been trained, over 1215 THN kits have been distributed through 51 HR sites in BC and 125 overdoses have been success-fully reversed. The locations of sites in BC providing naloxone are available at the Toward the Heart website. 90 Figure 6.11 BC Take home naloxone program statistics, August 2014 The BC THN pilot program provides kits containing: 2 glass ampoules of 0.4 mg/ml naloxone, 2 safety syringes, 2 alcohol swabs, 2 latex gloves, a one-way rescue breathing barrier mask, THN administration information form and an illustrated guide on how to respond to an opioid overdose (Figure 6.12 and Figure 6.13). In BC prescription only medications must be prescribed to a specific individual with indications for personal use by a physician or nurse practitioner; other Canadian provinces continue to utilize pre-written orders where a nurse can sign-off on a prescription or Medical Directives are in place. Resources for the program including training and administration materials are available at the Toward the Heart website. 90JBack to T able of Content HARM REDUCTION 84 YBC DOAP REPORT 2014 Y Take home naloxone programs save lives and prevent brain damage due to lack of oxygen in opioid overdose situations.

Methadone is a long acting synthetic opiate agonist which does not cause euphoric or sedating effects. When taken orally methadone is readily absorbed, has a slow onset and thus can be taken orally once daily. It should be given at a relatively constant dose in order to reduce heroin cravings and block opioid withdrawal symptoms. 115 Patients on MMT may progress to abstinence, remain on methadone indefinitely, or leave the program perhaps to return at a later date. Studies have found that among opioid addicted patients, those who maintain MMT have a reduced risk of morbidity and mortality and reduced involvement in crime and helps them have control over their lives. In BC, the Methadone Maintenance System regulates the MMT program based on a multidisciplinary approach with three key components: 1) prescribing, 2) dispensing, and 3) counselling. The College of Physicians and Surgeons of British Columbia (CPSBC) and the College of Pharmacists of British Columbia (CPBC) are the professional regulatory bodies accountable for methadone maintenance prescribing and dispensing. The objective of CPSBC's program is to ensure that physicians safely and effectively prescribe methadone for maintenance purposes. CPBC licenses and regulates pharmacists, pharmacy technicians, and their places of practice. CPBC also offers policy guidance and training for pharmacists who purchase and dispense methadone. 117 Recently (2014) the Government of BC has adopted the term 'opioid substitution treatment' (OST) which includes suboxone (buprenorphine and naloxone) as well as methadone. However the vast majority (>94% 14,833 of 15,754 in 2012/13) of patients on OST in BC are prescribed methadone. 116 Figure 6.14 shows patients on methadone maintenance therapy by health authority. Figure 6.14 Methadone Maintenance Therapy patients by health authority, BC 2007/08 to 2012/13 16,000 14,000 12,000 10,000 8,000 6,000 11,385 12,703 13,895 14,833JBack to T able of Content HARM REDUCTION 86 YBC DOAP REPORT 2014 Y In 2012/13 53% of patients received a stabilizing dose of methadone >60mg; and between 34% and 45% of people started on metha done in 2011/12 were retained in treatment at 12 months.116 In 2012/2013 FH had the highest number of new and continuing patients but the number of patients in MMT in NH has remained low and relatively unchanged during over the past 10-years.116 Long travel times to Northern MMT clinics remains a barrier to access. In 2011, about 9% of NH MMT clients lived over 100 km from the nearest methadone prescriber.118The distribution of OST clients in BC varies by LHA. (Figure 6.15) A recent review of FNHA 's National Native Alcohol & Drug Abuse Program found that harm reduction approaches are supported in the majority of residential treatment centres in BC. Additionally about half of the centres accept clients who are receiving methadone. However, accessibility to MMT service providers and pharmacies offering methadone can be limited, 0 0.30 - 1.761.77 - 3.043.05 - 4.904.91 - 8.018.02 - 39.29Figure 6.15 Opioid substitution treatment patients by local health area 2012/1379 Persons per 1000 population 18+ Prince George Kamloops Lower Mainland Downtown VancouverDowntown Eastside South IslandVictoriaKitimat 87 YBC DOAP REPORT 2014 Y CHAPTER 6 particularly in rural and remote areas, which poses challenges for methadone initiation and continued adherence and may require clients to travel considerable distances. 119 The FNHA welcomes future opportunities for dialogue related to harm reduction and other aspects of these programs and services to better meet the treatment needs of First Nations clients, in collaboration with regions, communities and other partners and services providers. METHADOSE In February 2014, BC changed the formulation of methadone from a compounded 1mg/ml solution dispensed as an orange flavored drink, to a standard 10mg/ml, cherry flavored liquid called Meth-adose\u00ae. Benefits of Methadose include 1) longer shelf life and no need to refrigerate 2) quality control and consistent dosing, 3) painful when injected so discourages injection. The new BC guide-lines also reduced home delivery of methadone by pharmacists to only exceptional circumstances (i.e. due to a patient's restricted mobility, and with physician authorization). 120 Alberta changed to Methadose in September 2012 and some US states have used Methadose since the 1970's. Other jurisdictions may permit pharmacists to dilute unflavoured Methadose at their discretion. In BC, only the cherry flavoured formulation is available and if dispensed for carry out is done so in individual doses. Concerns related to the change in BC were expressed by people on methadone, communities, and local health agencies. Concerns included the potential for unintended overdose due to: 1) difficulty in titrating dose changes; 2) diversion (i.e. persons consuming illicitly without a prescription being unaware of 10-fold higher concentration); and 3) accidental ingestion by a child because Methadose looks like Children's Tylenol\u00ae, and a small amount (1 ml) can be fatal in children. 121 Raising public and professional awareness of the new Methadose formulation was important to ensure a smooth and safe transition. All pharmacy managers, staff, relief pharmacists, and pharmacy technicians employed in community pharmacies that provide MMT-related services were required to complete training designed to help them transition patients over to Methadose. Educational pamphlets and posters were devel oped collaboratively by CPSBC, CPBC, and the BC Ministry of Health. Posters developed by HRSS (Figure 6.16) were translated into Chinese and Punjabi to help inform patients of the change. Some MMT patients report the effect of Methadose does not last as long as the previous methadone formulation, needing higher doses or have returned to illicit opioid use. T o assess these concerns more objectively a question was added to the 2014 HR client survey. For further updates and information regarding the change to Methadose in BC, please refer to the Toward the Heart website.

The North American Opiate Medications Initiative (NAOMI) study, which took place between 2005 and 2008, was the first clinical trial to investigate whether providing injectable pharmaceutical grade heroin was more effective than oral MMT in recruiting, retaining, and benefiting chronic treatment resistant opioid users. NAOMI found that participants treated with diacetylmorphine (the active ingredient of heroin) showed improved mental and physical health. After one year, 88% of the diacetylmorphine group remained in treatment, compared to 54% of the MMT group. Many participants in the diacetylmorphine group also successfully transitioned to oral treatment, detox programs, and abstinence. Furthermore, the NAOMI study found that many participants could not tell the difference between diacetylmorphine and hydromorphone (HDM), a licensed pain medication. The Study to Assess Longer-term Opioid Medication Effectiveness (SALOME) study was established to determine if HDM is as effective as diacetylmorphine. 122 In 2013, 75 participants in the SALOME study had completed 12 months in the clinical study. Some of individuals were transferred to methadone, HDM, or drug-free programs. However, some patients did not respond to these treatments and still required diacetylmorphine assisted therapy after the trial. In response to their health needs, doctors with the SALOME project applied to Health Canada's Special Access Programme (SAP) to legally prescribe diacetylmorphine outside of the study. SAP approved the 21 applications. But the federal Health Minister intervened by introducing new regulations identifying dia-cetylmorphine as a restricted substance under the Food and Drug Act. This subsequently barred access to the treatment, despite SAP approval. In response, Providence Health Care and five former SALOME patients launched a constitutional challenge on November 13, 2013 arguing that the Health Minister's actions violated the Charter of Rights. On May 29, 2014 the BC Supreme Court granted a temporary injunction that re-establishes access to diacetylmorphine assisted treatment. This decision will permit prescription diacetylmor-phine for SAP approved cases and future requests made by SALOME until the case goes to trial. 12389 YBC DOAP REPORT 2014 Y CHAPTER 7 CHAPTER 7 LAW ENFORCEMENT A psychoactive substance is defined as \"an intoxicating, stimulating, or narcotic chemical or drug\" .124 The federal government categorizes them based on their potential for abuse or addiction; categories range from illegal street drugs to prescription medications. 125 Drug regulation in Canada goes back to the early 20th century. The first such law was the Opium Act of 1908, which prohibited opium use. 126 T oday the Food and Drug Act and the Controlled Drugs and Substances Act are Canada's federal drug control statutes, which were developed to comply with three United Nations conventions on substance control established in 1961, 1971 and 1988. 126 Production, trafficking, importation and use of illicit drugs are associated with crime at all levels of society. Enforcement, recognized as one of the City of V ancouver's four pillars of drug strategy, is an important component to keep public order and safety. 2 Law enforcement in BC is provided by the Royal Canadian Mounted Police (RCMP) (federal, provincial and municipal forces) and independent police departments, including one First Nations administered police service. The RCMP serves most areas in BC. There are eleven independent municipal police departments which serve twelve municipalities. V ancouver is served by the V ancouver Police Department (VPD), which covers the area from Boundary Road in the east to Point Grey in the west, excluding the University Endowment Lands. Other municipalities include, on V ancouver Island - Central Saanich, Saanich, Oak Bay, Esquimalt and Victoria; and in the rest of BC Abbotsford, Delta, New Westminster, Port Moody, West V ancouver and Nelson. 127 0 Data Collection Data about Criminal Code and Controlled Drugs and Substances Act offences are collected using the Uniform Crime Reporting (UCR2) Survey. Changes made to the UCR Survey that became effective in 2009 enabled police officers to collect more detailed information about each event reported to the police. The three main categories of Criminal Code offences (violent, property and other crime) were revised to better reflect the nature of crime. For example the number of violent crimes now equals the number of identified victims in each violent incident and the number of property crimes and other crimes is equal to the number of distinct incidents. 128 Since 1997, offences involving drugs have been prosecuted under the Controlled Drugs and Substances Act (CDSA). 129 Offences arising from this federal statute are categorized by type of drug: heroin, cocaine, cannabis and other drugs including methamphetamines (crystal meth), methylenedioxyamphetamines (MDMA - ecstasy), and hallucinogens. Drug offences are also classified by type of crime: possession, trafficking, importation/ exportation and production. An amendment to CDSA introduced in 2011 added another violation code for precursor/equipment (crystal meth or ecstasy) making it illegal to possess, produce, sell or import anything that can be used in production of crystal meth or ecstasy. 130 Beside changes in reporting methods, other factors such as demographic changes, police enforcement practices and poli-cies influence the number and rate of Criminal Code and CDSA violations reported by the police. 128 0 Crime in BC According to the latest available publication by Statistics Canada, in 2012 the province of BC had the second highest number of total Criminal Code offences and was ranked sixth by the police- reported crime rate. 131 Drug crime rate in BC was higher than the Canadian average; only Yukon and Northwest T erritories had rates higher than BC. 132 Figure 7.1 shows overall and drug crime in BC in 2012. While drug crimes account for only 6.6% of overall crime in BC, illicit drugs are associated with a range of criminal offences, including murder, attempted murder, break and enter, robbery, car theft, possession of stolen property, sexual assault, uttering threats, prostitution, etc. These crimes may be committed in order to fund drug habits (gainful crimes), offenders may have been under the influence of a drug when committing the crime, or the criminal activity was part of a business transaction in relation to drugs. Although numerous studies support the strong associa-tion between drugs and criminal behaviour, the actual propor-tion of crimes attributable to illicit drugs is difficult to estimate. A study carried out by the Canadian Centre on Substance Abuse (CCSA) in 2002 estimated that the prevalence of substance use among federal inmates was 40%. Approximately half of violent crimes (e.g. homicide, attempted murder, and assault) and half of gainful crimes (e.g. theft, break and enter, and robbery) were associated with alcohol and/or illicit drugs. 133JBack to T able of Content LAW ENFORCEMENT 90 YBC DOAP REPORT 2014 Y Figure 7.2 shows the number and rate of drug crime in BC from 2005 to 2012, categorized by type of crime. The rate is calculated per 1,000 population using BC Stats population estimates based on 2006 Canada Census data. The rate of drug offences decreased from 6.6 per 1,000 population in 2007 to 5.5 per 1,000 population in 2012.

This may result in the police filing a Report to Crown Council recommending charges be laid and this status is reported in the UCR2 Survey, or despite sufficient evidence to support the charges, the police recommend another course of action, i.e. referral to a diversion program as an alternative to prosecution. 128 In 2012, out of the total of 25,432 drug offences, 18,363 (72%) were cleared by charge or other means. The number of persons charged with CDSA offences reached its highest peak in 2007, with 9,919 persons charged, but decreased over the next five years, with 7,634 persons charged in 2012. In 2012, 65% of charges were for possession, 30% for trafficking, 4% for production and less than 1% for importation/exportation offences (Figure 7.3). The proportion of CDSA offences categorized by type of drug is shown in Figure 7.4.

Offences involving cannabis (including hashish or marijuana in powdered, leaf, liquid or resin form) represent almost 70% of all drug offences in 2012. There were 17,670 cannabis offences recorded, with a rate of 3.8 offences per 1,000 population. In 2012, possession represented 86% (15,197) of cannabis (18). of cannabis offences were cleared. Of the 4,420 persons charged with cannabis offences in 2012, 78% (3,465) were charged with possession, 15% (646) with trafficking, 0.1% (4) with importation/ exportation and 7% (305) with production offences. COCAINE and its preparations are Schedule I controlled substances. The number of cocaine offences continues to decrease from its highest point in 2006, with 7,518 offences, to the lowest recorded number of 4,350 offences in 2012. Offences of possession represented 59% (2,572), trafficking accounted for 40% (1,746) and importation/exportation accounted for less than 1% (32) of all cocaine offences. Close to 72% (3,129) of cocaine offences were cleared. Of the 1,997 persons charged with cocaine offences in 2012, 61% (1,216) were charged with trafficking, almost 39% (775) with possession and 0.3% (6) with importation offences.HEROIN and other derivatives of opium are Schedule I controlled substances. Between 2005 and 2012 the number of offences involving heroin peaked in 2006 with 698 offences, then continued to be stable around 500 for four years, only to increase sharply again in 2012 with 730 offences. Offences of possession accounted for 68% (500), trafficking for 31% (224), and importation/exportation accounted for less than 1% (6) of all heroin offences. Almost 80% of heroin offences were cleared in 2012. There were 376 persons charged with heroin offences: trafficking accounted for 53% (200), possession for 46% (174) and importation/exportation accounted for less than 1% (2) of all charges involving heroin. 0 Crime in V ancouver The City of V ancouver is home to more than 650,000 people and is the integral part of the V ancouver Census Metropolitan Area (CMA), which has close to 2.5 million inhabitants. 7 V ancouver is the economic, transportation and export/import centre of the region, with the largest seaport in Canada and the second larg-est airport in the country. 135 According to Statistics Canada, of the five census metropolitan areas with the highest drug crime rate in Canada in 2012, four, including V ancouver, are in BC. 131 7 6543210Rate per 100,000 population Drug offences (rate) Canada average drug offences (rate)Figure 7.5 Rate of CDSA offences by census metropolitan area, REPORT 2014 Y CHAPTER 7 Metro V ancouver's advanced transportation network makes it easy for offenders to commit a crime in one area and quickly move to another. The introduction of Police Records Information Management Environment (PRIME) BC in November 2009, made it possible for police officers to track offenders across different jurisdictions within the City of V ancouver. However, it is challenging to present data for the whole V ancouver CMA because several municipalities within V ancouver CMA are served by independent police departments, which have different practices in publishing their data. Therefore, only V ancouver Police Department (VPD) data is presented in this section. As outlined in the latest Strategic Plan, the major goal of VPD is to make V ancouver the safest major city in Canada. 136 The con- tinuous efforts and partnership projects with local communities have resulted in decreasing numbers of Criminal Code offences in all three categories, although this downward trend has been the most significant in the property crime category (Figure 7.6). V ANCOUVER CDSA OFFENCES A downward trend is also seen when looking at the CDSA offences separately (Figure 7.7). The highest number of CDSA violations was recorded in 2006 (5,183 violations) with the rate of 8.5 per 1,000 population. Since 2006, the number and rate of CDSA offences continued to decrease, reaching the lowest point in the last 15 years in 2013 (drug crime rate was 3.48 per 1,000 population in 1999).1 From the highest point in 2006, offences involving cannabis decreased by 36%, offences involving cocaine decreased by 64%, offences involving heroin decreased almost 60% and offences involving other drugs decreased by close to 75%.

Cannabis was involved in the great majority (70%) of CDSA offences at the provincial level compared to only 40% of drug offences in V ancouver; thus a larger proportion of drug offences involved heroin and cocaine in V ancouver compared to BC. 0 Alternatives to Incarceration Despite the reductions in property crime and drug offences, V ancouver rates are still among the highest in Canada and in BC. A large proportion of property crime is associated with substance use, which is prominent in the Downtown Eastside (DTES) and there are a high number of chronic offenders. In 2004, the V ancouver Police Department created the Chronic Offender Program (COP) to better understand socioeconomic and health issues that led to their criminal behaviour. They found that 379 individuals had more than 12 charges in the past 12 months and 78% of them had drug and/or alcohol addictions. In the follow-up period from 2001 to 2006, one hundred of them (more than 25%) had more than 54 convictions each. 138 Chronic offenders with a range of health and socioeconomic problems represent a challenge to the justice system and a different approach to address their complex needs and interrupt the so-called \"revolving door phenomenon\" (imprisonment-> discharge from prison-> involvement in street crime-> conviction-> imprisonment) was needed. Addressing the root causes of criminal behaviour, namely addiction, homelessness, low education level, unemployment and mental health, is thought to have more sustainable effects on rehabilitation of chronic offenders. Frequent re-offending creates a backlog of adult Revolving Door Phenomenon Discharge from Prison Involvement in Street Crime ConvictionImprisonmentFigure 7.8 Comparison between CDSA Offences in BC and Vancouver, able of Content LAW ENFORCEMENT 96 YBC DOAP REPORT 2014 Y criminal cases in the Provincial Court, so it may take from six weeks to six months for an offender to appear in court. This can lead to a termination of cases due to extensive delays, which further reduces chances for an offender to access treatment and social services and start the path towards recovery. 139 Problem-Solving Courts were developed with the main goal to reduce recidivism and drug use through offering specialized programs instead of imprisonment. Repeat offenders are dealt with in a timely manner and provided with addiction treatment, healthcare, and social support. Of five problem-solving courts in BC, two operate in V ancouver and will be described in the following sections. These are the Drug Treatment Court of V ancouver (DTCV) and the Downtown Community Court (DCC). DRUG TREA TMENT COURT OF V ANCOUVER Drug Treatment Courts (DTCs) were developed based on the integration of addiction treatment services with justice system case processing. The first DTC opened in the US in Florida (1989), and the first Canadian court opened in T oronto in 1998, followed by V ancouver in December 2001. The Federal Department of Justice, through partnership with Health Canada, subsequently provided funding for an additional four sites in Edmonton (2005), followed in 2006 by Winnipeg, Ottawa, and Regina. There are also DTCs in Calgary (AB), Moose Jaw (SK), London (ON) and Durham (ON), which are funded by their municipal governments. 140 The common objectives for all DTCs are reducing substance use, offending and re-offending through the rehabilitation of persons who commit crimes to support their drug addiction. The Crown prosecutor determines eligibility after reviewing applications submitted by offenders. Individual assessment is conducted by treatment personnel who put forward an admis-sion plan to the DTC team. The interdisciplinary team consists of provincial and federal Crown prosecutors, trained judges, court registry staff, defense counsel, psychologists, addiction therapists, case managers, financial assistance workers and probation officers. An offender can start the program after pleading guilty, but has 30 days to withdraw the guilty plea and enter the traditional court system. The program requires intensive participation, including weekly court attendance and counselling sessions, and respecting the strict bail conditions. Over 14 months participants receive 265 clinic hours of addiction treatment that is tailored to their individual needs. Random urine drug testing, incentives and sanctions are used to ensure compliance. Program graduation criteria include abstinence from drugs for three months preceding graduation, no new offences for the last six months, and evidence of social stability (stable housing, school enrolment, employment or volunteer work). The graduate returns to court for sentencing - usually a suspended sentence and a term of probation. Participants are removed from the program if there is a pattern of repeated positive drug testing and lack of compliance with the program. If an offender is not successful in completing the program, he/she is sentenced as part of the regular court process. 140 The first evaluation of the DTCV was carried out in 2006 by the National Crime Prevention Centre. From December 2001 to March 2005, 322 individuals participated in the program, but only 43 (14%) completed it. After six months, among those who completed the program, 30% tested positive for drugs and 10% had new charges; among those who did not complete the program, all had positive urine drug test and 35% had new criminal charges. Results for a comparison group consisted of 166 offenders with a history of drug addiction and were in custody for various reasons, not only drug offences, were not reported. 141 The study was criticized for the lack of randomiza- tion, poorly selected comparison group and failure to provide an intention-to-treat analysis. 142 In 2006 V ancouver Coastal Health took charge of the treatment component and full-time staff members providing Aboriginal care, housing, and financial support were added to the team. A subsequent evaluation looked at 180 DTCV participants enrolled between December 2001 and March 2008, regardless of whether they graduated from the program compared to 180 propensity score matched participants sentenced through the Provincial Court between April 2003 and March 2009. A 'before-after' analysis showed a significant decrease in the percentage of offenders who committed a new offence in both groups, but no differences between the DTCV (78% to 51%) and the matched comparison (72% to groups. CDSA offences pre-treatment (pre-sentencing) differed between (DCTV was 63% and matched comparison 21%); new CDSA offences were 28% and 14% respectively. 143 Drug use in the follow-up period and costs associated with DTCV enrolment versus traditional sentencing were not reported. Debate continues regarding the effectiveness and costs of DTCV . Allared et al. present a comprehensive analysis of method- ological issues in DTC evaluation studies, as well as legal and ethical concerns that arise from DTCs in general. Introduction of DTCs as an alternative to incarceration represents an important step forward in the reform of the Canadian justice system, but there are still many opportunities to improve their functioning in order to reduce drug-related crime and improve public safety. 14497 YBC DOAP REPORT 2014 Y CHAPTER 7 DOWNTOWN COMMUNITY COURT While DTCs focus primarily on offenders whose chronic reoffending is perpetuated by substance use, community courts focus on the integration of the justice system with the local social and health care services within clearly defined geographical boundaries. They apply problem-solving approaches to the street-level crime and safety matters in a neighbourhood, with emphasis on addressing the crime where and when it happens. An offender has the opportunity to see the consequences of his/her behaviour and make immediate compensation to the community in the form of community service. This model was developed in New Y ork City at the Midtown Community Court, which opened in 1993. In the next 15 years community courts sprang across the US and were introduced in other countries such as the UK, Australia, New Zealand, and South Africa. 145 The first Canadian community court opened in September 2008 in V ancouver DTES. It is funded by the BC government and represents the partnership between the Provincial Court of BC and 15 agencies and organizations, including Ministry of Social Development, BC Housing, Legal Services Society, Public Prosecution Service, V ancouver Coastal Health, V ancouver Police Department, Elizabeth Fry Society of Greater V ancouver, V ancouver Aboriginal Transformative Justice Services Society and Watari Counselling and Support Services Society. 145 The team includes a defence lawyer (available at all times), a Provincial Court judge, a case manager, a Crown counsel, court clerks, police officers, probation officers, an occupational therapist, a licensed practical nurse, social workers, employment and income assistance workers, a BC housing support worker, native court workers, and forensic liaison workers. A victim service worker is also available onsite to assist victims through the community court process. Community partners include local residents, merchants, faith groups and schools. 146 The court now processes about 2,500 cases per year, addressing various low-profile offenders in the central business district, Chinatown, Coal Harbour, Downtown Eastside, Gastown, Strathcona, Y aletown, the West End and Stanley Park. 139 DCC operates based on three guiding principles: - Timeliness - reduction of time from charge to conviction (offenders are heard within 2 to 14 days and if assigned to do community service, they start within 24 hours) - Integration - partnership between the justice system, health-care and social services and the community to address the complex needs of offenders - Connection to community - local businesses and organiza-tions provide opportunities for offenders to do community service helping them gain new skills and work experience and develop pro-social behaviour, which increases offender accountability A person charged with an offence discusses the case with a defence lawyer and has an interview with a community court staff. If the accused pleads guilty, the case can be dealt with in the DCC. The judge has several options depending on the severity of the current offence, history of re-offending, and personal history. For minor offences, an \"alternative measure\" in the form of community service may be appropriate or an offender may be referred to addiction/mental health treat - ment or employment programs. For more serious offences, an accused might be sentenced to probation, a fine, time in jail or any combination of these. 145 The effectiveness of DCC was evaluated by researchers from the Faculty of Health Sciences and School of Criminology at Simon Fraser University and by an independent evaluator, R.A. Malatest & Associates. The evaluation focused on three areas: 1. DCC efficiency. Implementation of DCC had neither positive nor negative effect on several measures of efficiency (the average number of appearances per concluded case, the median time to disposition, the proportion of individuals dealt with through alternative measures, the number of post-sentence court appearances, the number of cases awaiting trial, etc.) 147 2. Offender outcomes were evaluated only on the subset of DCC participants who were assigned to the Case Management T eam (CMT) because of their higher risk of re-offending and high needs (n=279, which is 9.5% of total DCC cohort processed between 2008 and 2011). The comparison group consisted of individuals sentenced through the Provincial Court in the same time period (n=4,377). A total of 249 individuals were selected in CMT group and the same number was selected in the matched comparison group (MCG). The greater reduction in total number of offences and property offences was seen in the CMT group compared to MCG, but drug offences were not reported. 148 3. Community engagement was assessed through a series of qualitative studies, focus group discussions and surveys. The results showed that representatives from the community service agencies were supportive of the vision and goals of the Downtown Community Court, but many expressed concerns regarding the commitment of stakeholders, decision-making process within DCC, long term support for clients after their court obligations finish, and transparency about the court's impact in the community. 146JBack to T able of Content LAW ENFORCEMENT 98 YBC DOAP REPORT 2014 Y 0 Drug Thefts From Pharmacies According to Health Canada, all people involved in legal distribution of controlled substances must take appropriate security measures by providing designated space for storage of such substances (i.e. the pharmacy narcotic vault and locked cabinets) and keeping prescriptions and orders for Schedule I, II and III drugs in a secure space, inaccessible and invisible to the public. 149 Each case of theft, loss or forgery must be reported to the police immediately and to the Health Canada, Office of Controlled Substances within 10 days. The College of Pharmacists of BC has collected this information since 2009; however data from 2009, 2010 and 2011 are inconsis-tent and unreliable (for example, there are only 3 entries for all 2010). In the first six months of 2014, there were more robberies/break-ins than in the whole previous year (36 vs. 32). Opioids (oxycodone, Percocet, methadone) were involved in 126 out of 135 cases. When sold on the street, these substances can cause serious problems for people who use who are not aware of the drug content or potency. From March 2009 to July 2014 there were 135 events; - 53 armed robbery - 42 robbery - 30 break and enter - 10 attempted robbery or break and enter About half (68) of the events occurred in Fraser Health: ancouver Coastal Health had 51 reports: the majority were in V ancouver (46) and two each North V ancouver and West V ancouver and one in Richmond VIHA had 4 reports -Victoria (2), Nanaimo (1) and Qualicum Beach (1)Interior Health had 11 reports; 4 of these were in Kelowna and the rest distributed across the health authority. Northern Health had 1 report which was in Fort St John. DOAP collaboratively developed recommendations to respond to pharmacy break-in or robberies. If the police have concerns about the pharmaceuticals stolen and possible action or interactions they are advised to contact the BC Drug and Poison Information Centre which has a 24-hour phone line with pharmacists available. As on all occasions when it is determined necessary to issue a media release or local alert, it is suggested the police (or other alerting authority) discuss with the corresponding medical health officer who in turn may seek input from service providers and PWUD to ensure the wording is appropriate. 0 Drug Trafficking Drug trafficking is a lucrative business on an interna tional scale. Distribution of plant-based substances follows well-established drug-trafficking pathways from their geographical region of cultivation to the consumer markets around the world, including Canada. An import ant part of law enforcement at the national, regional and international level is to interrupt these trade pathways, including eradication of cultivating crops, dismantling of manufacturing labs and seizure of shipments at interna - tional borders. UN Office on Drugs and Crime (UNODC) collects data about cultivation, production, distribution and sale of illicit drugs, which is published each year in the World Drug Report. Data presented in this section are from the latest report published online in 2014. 24 The Canada Border Services Agency reports drug seizures and estimated value of drugs arriving from other countries through air, sea and land routes. Drugs that are trafficked across borders are usually concentrated to reduce the volume necessary to transport. OPIUM AND HEROIN Heroin (diacetylmorphine) is manufactured from raw opium. In order to produce 1 kg of heroin, 7-10 kg of raw opium is needed. Afghanistan continues to be the world's largest producer of opium with an estimated production of 5,500 tons in 2013 (about 80% of global opium production). The second largest producer of opium is Myanmar, with an estimated production of 870 tons of opium (12.6% of global production) in 2013. In recent years, Mexico has emerged as the third largest producer of opium. 24 The latest available data about drug seizures in Canada are from the RCMP Report on the Illicit Drug Situation-2009.150 In 2009, a record of 213 kg of heroin was seized in Canada, plus an additional 6 kg seized abroad en route to Canada; 339 kg of opium and 17 tons of dried opium poppy pods were seized. Despite unavailability of forensic profiling to determine the geographical origin of the seized opiates, it is believed that the majority of shipments originated in Afghanistan and only 2% from Southeast Asia and Latin America. 15099 YBC DOAP REPORT 2014 Y CHAPTER 7 COCAINE The three South American countries - Colombia, Peru and Bolivia - are the world's largest producers of cocaine. According to the UNODC World Drug Report 2014, the cultivation and production of cocaine are in decline due to eradication of coca bush plantations and seizures of illicit laboratories that manufacture cocaine. In Colombia, the area under the coca bush cultivation decreased from 135,000 ha in 2012 to 89,000 ha in 2013, and also decreased in Peru and in Bolivia. Consequently, the estimated production of cocaine chlorohydrate fell from 405 tons in 2012 to 331 tons in 2013 in Colombia. Along with the decline in cocaine production, the decline of cocaine purity was noted in major consumer markets of North America and Europe. Commonly used adulterants are levamisole (anti-parasitic), lidocaine, procaine, benzocaine, caffeine, hydroxyzine (antihistamine) phenacetin (analgesic). Levamisole has been associated with severe neutropenia and other harms as described in the morbidity section. Trafficking of cocaine flows through the Pacific and Caribbean maritime routes to Mexico and then to the US and Canada. Smaller quantities are transported by air cargo, commercial trucks and private vessels. In 2009, law enforcement agencies across Canada seized 2,373 kg of cocaine and 15.6 kg of crack cocaine. 150 CANNABIS Cannabis can be cultivated indoors or outdoors and the scale ranges from a few plants for personal use to thousands of plants intended for exploitation and drug trafficking. There are several varieties available on the market: herb, resin, plant, oil and seed. Cannabis is the most frequently used substance in the majority of countries in the world, including Canada. Cultivation in Canada happens mostly in BC, Ontario and Quebec, predominantly in indoor marijuana grow operations (MGOs). Despite domestic production exceeding demand, different cannabis preparations (marijuana herb, hashish, hash oil) continue to be imported into Canada from Ja-maica, the US, the Netherlands, Thailand, Pakistan, Afghanistan, Morocco, Lebanon, South Africa, Mozam-bique and Kenya. 150 Organized crime groups use mostly air cargo and passenger flights to bring cannabis into Canada, while hashish is usually smuggled concealed in containers on large commercial boats. Canada is also a source country for cannabis intended for trade in the US market. 24In 2009, Canadian law enforcement agencies seized 34,391 kg of marijuana, 1,845,734 marijuana plants, 9,666 kg of hashish and 241 kg of hash oil. SYNTHETIC DRUGS 'Synthetic drugs' refers to psychoactive substances synthe-sized in the laboratory from precursor chemicals that are normally used in the production of legitimate industrial and household goods. In general, synthetic drugs are classified into two major groups: 1. Amphetamine-type stimulants (A TS) include (NPS) are substances \"that are not controlled by the 1961 Single Convention on Narcotic Drugs or the 1971 Convention on Psychotropic substances, but which may pose a public health threat\" . 151 They are often with labels 'not for human consumption' in order to avoid detection and control. Virtually endless possibilities exist for the alteration of chemical structure and synthesis of new molecules. This is supported by the fact that the UNODC identified 348 NPS by 2013, although this number does not take into account substances that are on the market but are not reported. 152 The growing demand for A TS and NPS has led to the expansion of A TS trafficking routes and manufacturing labs to all six continents. Of all A TS, amphetamine and methamphetamine remain the most commonly manufac-tured substances worldwide, while the manufacture of ecstasy and its analogues is less widespread. Since 2008, seizures in A TS have increased globally. This prompted UNODC to initiate the Global Synthetics Monitoring: Analyses, Reporting and Trends (SMART) Programme, which now monitors the synthetic drug situation all over the world. Globally, seizures of A TS reached almost 140 tons in 2012. Although the highest number of dismantled A TS-manufacturing laboratories was reported in 2004 (19,799), in 2009 10,598 labs were dismantled. 153JBack to T able of Content LAW ENFORCEMENT 100 YBC DOAP REPORT 2014 Y It is estimated that Canada produces 0.6-4.6% of the global A TS supply.154 Besides domestic production and distribution, organized crime groups in Canada are involved in international MDMA and methamphetamine trade. In 2009, the RCMP reported seizure of 954,929 units of MDMA, 78.79 kg /62,307 tablets of methamphetamine, kg of ketamine and 210,151 tablets of BZP .

Details regarding prosecutions can be found at http://www.cbsa-asfc.gc.ca/media/prosecutions-poursuites/pac/2013-12-16-eng.html this includes individual's body packing small amounts of heroin and methamphetamine, larger seizures for example 130Kg of cocaine was seized from a large marine con - tainer from Russia in September 2013; and precursor chemicals.Data regarding seizures for 2008 to 2013 was obtained from the CBSA, Pacific Region. This data includes estimated monetary street value of the drugs seized. Where drugs are reported as grams and as dosage e.g. ecstasy and methamphetamine and am-phetamine or as solid, liquid or residue events are summed but no weight or volume amounts are included. See T able 7.5. In 2013 the total street value of drugs seized was estimated as $47 million.

It shows cocaine seized peaked in 2010 and consistently has the greatest value of drugs seized each year by CBSA. In 2013 although the number of seizures of cocaine was less than the previous year the value was higher as larger volumes were seized. Heroin also increased in 2013. Methamphetamine and amphetamine together and ecstasy have remained consistently below $10million per year. PRECURSOR CHEMICALS The 1988 UN Convention against Illicit Traffic in Narcotic Drugs and Psychotropic Substances regulates the trade of chemicals that can be used in the process of manufactur-ing drugs (plant-based or synthetic). Health Canada implemented the Precursor Control Regulations in January 2003. In 2011 amendments were made to the CDSA to include possession and trafficking of precursor chemicals and/or equipment as a new violation code. Currently only 23 chemicals are under strict international control, although the list is constantly monitored and updated. Controlled precursor chemicals are classified as T able I (substances that become incorporated into a new drug at the molecular level during the manufacturing process) and T able II substances (reagents and solvents used in the process of production which do not become incorporated into the newly synthesized molecule). The list is shown in T able 7.6. Table 7.6 The list of internationally controlled precursor chemicals24 Table I Table II Acetic of Canadian Border Services Agency, Pacific Region, selected drug seizures ($CDN) (Canada Border Services Agency, Pacific Region Enforcement and Intelligence Division, Intelligence Section, September 24, 2014)103 YBC DOAP REPORT 2014 Y CHAPTER 7 The International Narcotics Control Board (INCB) monitors the legal and illegal trade of precursor chemicals. The Precursor Incident Communication System (PICS) was implemented in 2012 as an international monitoring system and source of information about trends, amounts and types of precursors legally and illegally transported around the world. In response to stricter control measures and amendments to legislation, drug traffickers and clandestine lab operators continue to introduce new chemicals (precursors and pre-precursors) into the market and move their operations into countries previously unaffected by synthetic drug trade. 152Land cross-border routes are the primary ways of transportation of precursor chemicals and/or lab equipment to and from Canada. The RCMP launched a Synthetic Drug Initiative in 2008 and, with partners from the industry, developed a program called ChemWatch to monitor and investigate incidents of diversion and theft and develop preventative measures. In 2009, most commonly seized chemicals in Canada were ephedrine (92 kg), pseudoephedrine (118 kg) and gamma-butyrolactone (GBL) (close to 2,000 litres), but considerable amounts of other chemicals, such as safrole and L-phenylacetylcarbinol (L-PAC) were seized as well. 150104 YBC DOAP REPORT 2014 YJBack to T able of Content ~Glossary Attributable Morbidity/Mortality The theoretical proportion of the number of cases of hospi- talizations/death that can be attributed to a given risk factor. 20 For this report, the values for the attributable fractions (AF) for tobacco and illicit drugs were taken directly from the report \"The Costs of Substance Abuse in Canada 2002\" by Jurgen Rehms et al. 20 Incidence The risk of developing a condition within a specified time period. The incidence rate is obtained by taking the number of people who have been diagnosed with a particular condition (new cases) within a stated period of time, divided by the number of people at risk for the condition. Life expectancy at birth This is the average number of years a person may expect to live assuming mortality rates remain stable for each age, usually aggregated over five year periods. Morbidity Another term for a disease state or illness. Incidence and prev-alence are two measures used to describe the occurrence of morbidity in a population. Mortality Rate The number of deaths due to a condition divided by the number of persons in the population. Opiate Naturally occurring alkaloids found in the opium poppy e.g. morphine and codeine Opioids (or narcotic analgesic) Psychoactive chemicals which proportion of people that have a condition at a specified time. Prevalence is calculated by taking the number of people with a particular condition and then dividing that number by the total number of people who are at risk for the condition.Rate a measure of frequency with which an event occurs in a specific population in a defined time period. Rates enable comparisons between geographic areas by taking into account different pop-ulation sizes and changes to these populations over time. Ratio A comparison between two numbers, usually separated by a colon. Risk The probability that an event will occur. Standardized Mortality Ratio (SMR) based on the age- and sex-specific rates in a standard popula-tion and the age and sex distribution of the study population. If the ratio of observed to expected deaths is greater than 1.0, there is an \"excess of deaths\" in the study population. 10 GLOSSARY105 YBC DOAP REPORT 2014 Y ~Data Sources ~BC Stats The central statistics agency for BC; it provides population estimates and projections. ~BC Vital Statistics Agency Registers all births and deaths in BC.
