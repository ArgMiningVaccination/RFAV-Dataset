[3](#B3-kjpp-21-197) [4](#B4-kjpp-21-197)]. MMPs can (MMP-2 and -7, addition to MMP-3, MMP-1 and MMP-13 were reported to play important roles in the destruction of cartilage in osteoarthritis. MMP-1 is a commonly detected metalloproteinase in synovial fluid from patients suffering aggrecanase in cartilage of mouse and ADAMTS-5 has been known to be important in cartilage matrix destruction during osteoarthritis acid could enhance cognitive function [ [24](#B24-kjpp-21-197)]. Also, oleanolic acid was reported to attenuate renal ischemia/reperfusion injury through its antioxidant, anti inflammatory and anti apoptotic activities [ [25](#B25-kjpp-21-197)] and inhibit rheumatoid arthritis via modulating T cell immune responses [ [26](#B26-kjpp-21-197)]. Methods Materials Primary cultures of chondrocytes from rabbit articular cartilage [27](#B27-kjpp-21-197)]. Treatment of cells with oleanolic acid Cytotoxicity assay [28](#B28-kjpp-21-197)]. Isolation of total RNA and RT-PCR [27](#B27-kjpp-21-197)]. The signal intensity of each band was analyzed by GelQuant software (DNR Bio-Imaging Systems Ltd., Jerusalem, Israel). Western blot analysis for measuring secretion level of MMP-3 in culture supernatant Casein zymography to measure the proteolytic activity of MMP-3 [27](#B27-kjpp-21-197)]. The signal intensity of each band was analyzed by GelQuant software (DNR Bio-Imaging Systems Ltd., Jerusalem, Israel). In vivo experiments Results Effect of oleanolic acid on MMP-3 gene expression in rabbit chondrocytes [Fig. 1](#F1-kjpp-21-197), oleanolic acid inhibited IL-1-induced MMP-3 gene expression. acid on viability of rabbit chondrocytes [Fig. 2](#F2-kjpp-21-197), oleanolic acid showed no significant cytotoxicity at the concentrations of 1, 10, 50, and 100 \u00b5M. The numbers of cells in oleanolic acid-treated cultures were 100\u00b110%, 91\u00b118%, 102\u00b113%, 107\u00b19%, and control, 1, 10, 50, and 100 \u00b5M oleanolic acid, respectively. Effect of oleanolic acid on the gene expression of MMP-1, MMP-13, ADAMTS-4, ADAMTS-5 or type II collagen in rabbit [Fig. 3](#F3-kjpp-21-197), oleanolic acid showed the suppression of MMP-1, MMP-13, ADAMTS-4, and ADAMTS-5, in rabbit chondrocytes. Furthermore, oleanolic acid showed an additional chondroprotective effect by restoring the compromised gene expression of type II collagen by IL-1, in rabbit chondrocytes. Effect of oleanolic acid MMP-3 from chondrocytes. However, acid reduced the effect of IL-1 on MMP-3 secretion. This result means that oleanolic acid can control the steps of protein synthesis and secretion of MMP-3. Effect of oleanolic acid on in rabbit articular chondrocytes, and this effect was reduced by pretreatment with oleanolic acid. Effect of oleanolic acid on MMP-3 articular cartilage However, been reported to play a pivotal pathophysiological role in osteoarthritis by degrading components of the extracellular matrix, such as proteoglycans. MMP-3 levels were increased more than MMP-1 levels in patients suffering from osteoarthritis in knee joints compared to the control group [ [7](#B7-kjpp-21-197) [35](#B35-kjpp-21-197)]. [36](#B36-kjpp-21-197) [37](#B37-kjpp-21-197) isoquinoline alkaloid extracted from an anti-inflammatory medicinal plant, also inhibited the expression of MMP-3 and MMP-13 through inhibition of NF-B activation in human chondrocytes [ [36](#B36-kjpp-21-197)]. Another natural product, matrine, inhibited IL-1-induced expression of MMPs by suppressing the activation NF-B in human chondrocytes in vitro [ [37](#B37-kjpp-21-197)]. Taraxasterol, a natural product with anti-inflammatory effect, suppressed IL-1-induced expression of MMP-1, MMP-3, [38](#B38-kjpp-21-197)]. Also, Schisandrae Fructus, an anti-inflammatory medicinal plant used in folk medicine, inhibited IL-1-induced expression and activity of MMP-1, MMP-3, and MMP-13 and markedly suppressed the nuclear translocation of NF-B by blocking IB-alpha degradation in SW1353 human chondrocytes [ [39](#B39-kjpp-21-197)]. [39](#B39-kjpp-21-197)]. In the present study, oleanolic acid affected the gene expression, secretion, and proteolytic activity of MMP-3, by directly acting on articular chondrocytes. We found that oleanolic acid inhibited of MMP-3, MMP-1, MMP-13, ADAMTS-4, and ADAMTS-5 and restored the gene expression of type II collagen that had been inhibited by IL-1, in rabbit articular chondrocytes chondroprotective effect of oleanolic acid are supported by its regulation of the gene expression of diverse proteases involved in the destruction of articular cartilage in osteoarthritis, as well as by its promotion of the gene expression of type II collagen at the transcriptional level. Additionally, IL-1-stimulated secretion and the proteolytic activity of reduced by acid ( [Fig. 4](#F4-kjpp-21-197)). This result means that oleanolic acid can regulate the step of protein synthesis and secretion of MMP-3 and affects the proteolytic activity of overproduced of MMP-3 in articular cartilage tissue. This result shows that, in addition to its in vitro effects, oleanolic acid exerts chondroprotective effect in vivo when administered via intraarticular injection. "}
