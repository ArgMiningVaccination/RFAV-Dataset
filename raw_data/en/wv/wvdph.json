European Journal of Integrative Medicine 2014 Acta Medica Academica Objective. The use of complementary and alternative medicine (CAM) among healthy population and in patients with certain health conditions has been investigated in Croatia; however, no studies have been carried out among health studies students and professionals. The aim of the study was to measure the extent of CAM use among health studies students.Materials and Methods.

Torture Quarterly Journal on Rehabilitation of Torture Victims and Prevention of Torture 2012 2010 Background: Interest in and use of complementary and alternative medicine (CAM) in the United States is increasing. However, CAM remains an area of nascency for researchers and western practitioners. Purpose: The purpose of this study was to examine U.S. health educators' attitudes toward CAM and their use of common CAM therapies.

Discussion: Health educators' overall positive attitudes toward CAM are consistent with the limited extant literature. However, important differences were found by various demographic characteristics, not previously identified. Translation to Health Education Practice: The r... This book is the result of many minds, hearts, and souls who have shared a vision of healing with me. It would not exist without them. It began when Lance Sholdt, then at the Uniformed Services University of the Health Sciences, asked if I would work with him to put together a course in complementary and alternative medicine for the medical students. His careful construction of this course helped us outline the contents of the book. This book is the brainchild of Jeff Levin. He was the first to suggest that a textbook like this was needed and could be written. His heartfelt work and attention to detail kept things moving when I was bogged down. Janette Carlucci is the soul of the book, managing both the special features and the day-to-day contact with the many authors. To her, a special thanks on this journey. Ron Chez provided a much needed balance for the book. He was always ready and willing to assist with a critical eye and keep us anchored to how this book could be of benefit for patients. I would also like to thank the editors, Jane Velker, Beth Goldner, and Joyce Murphy, for understanding the complexity of the topic and for a commitment to quality over deadlines. And Tim Hiscock for finally saying that we were going to press\u2014 ready or not. I would just as soon have worked another three years on it as finish.
