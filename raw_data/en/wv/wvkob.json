The most common skincare ingredient of all. You can usually find it right in the very first spot of the ingredient list, meaning it's the biggest thing out of all the stuff that makes up the product. It's mainly a solvent for ingredients that do not like to dissolve in oils but rather in water. Once inside the skin, it hydrates, but not from the outside - putting pure water on the skin (hello long baths!) is drying. One more thing: the water used in cosmetics is purified and deionized (it means that almost all of the mineral ions inside it is removed). Like this, the products can stay more stable over time. [moisturizer/humectant](/ingredient-functions/moisturizer-humectant), [solvent](/ingredient-functions/solvent), [viscosity controlling](/ingredient-functions/viscosity-controlling)| Irritancy: 0 | Comedogenicity: 0 - It's a helper ingredient that improves the freeze-thaw stability of products - It's also a solvent, humectant and to some extent a penetration enhancer - It has a bad reputation among natural cosmetics advocates but cosmetic scientists and toxicology experts do not agree (read more in the geeky details section) [Read all the geeky details about Propylene Glycol here >>](/ingredients/propylene-glycol#details) [Glycolic Acid](/ingredients/glycolic-acid)- superstar - It's the most researched AHA with the most proven skin benefits - It gently lifts off dead skin cells to reveal newer, fresher, smoother skin - It can help skin's own collagen production that results in firmer, younger skin - It can fade brown spots caused by sun damage or PIH - Choose a product where you know the concentration and pH value because these two greatly influence effectiveness - Don't forget to use your sunscreen (in any case but especially so next to an AHA product) - Slight stinging or burning with a stronger AHA product is normal - If your skin is very sensitive, rosacea prone choose rather a BHA or PHA product [Read all the geeky details about multi-functional skincare superstar with several proven benefits for the skin - Great anti-aging, wrinkle smoothing ingredient used at 4-5% concentration - Fades brown spots alone or in combination with amino sugar, acetyl glucosamine - Increases ceramide synthesis that results in a stronger, healthier skin barrier and better skin hydration - Can help to improve several skin conditions including acne, rosacea, and atopic dermatitis [Read Comedogenicity: 1 A handy helper ingredient (a polymer, i.e. big molecule from repeated subunits) that is used to stabilize emulsions as well as to thicken up products. It can also stabilize foam in cleansing products. [Lactic Acid](/ingredients/lactic-acid)- superstar [exfoliant](/ingredient-functions/exfoliant), [moisturizer/humectant](/ingredient-functions/moisturizer-humectant), [buffering](/ingredient-functions/buffering) - It's the second most researched AHA after glycolic acid - It gently lifts off dead skin cells to reveal newer, fresher, smoother skin - It also has amazing skin hydrating properties - In higher concentration (10% and up) it improves skin firmness, thickness and wrinkles - Choose a product where you know the concentration and pH value because these two greatly influence effectiveness - Don't forget to use your sunscreen (in any case but especially so next to an AHA product) [Read all the geeky details about Lactic Acid here >>](/ingredients/lactic-acid#details) [Malic Acid](/ingredients/malic-acid)- goodie Malic acid comes from apple and is an AHA. If these magic three letters don't tell you anything, [click here and read our detailed description on glycolic acid](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/glycolic-acid), the most famous AHA. So malic acid is an exfoliant, that can - just like other AHAs - gently lift off the dead skin cells of your skin and make it more smooth and fresh. There is not much research out there about malic acid itself. We could find one comparative study, that compared the effectiveness of glycolic acid, lactic acid, citric acid and malic acid. The first two ones were the winners while malic and citric acid were less effective. [Mandelic Acid](/ingredients/mandelic-acid)- goodie [exfoliant](/ingredient-functions/exfoliant), [antimicrobial/antibacterial](/ingredient-functions/antimicrobial-antibacterial) - Mandelic acid is an AHA that comes from bitter almond - It can gently lift off dead surface skin cells and make the skin more smooth and even - It has antibacterial properties - It's promising against acne and post inflammatory hyperpigmentation - It's light sensitive, so choose a product with opaque packaging [Read all the geeky details about Mandelic Acid here >>](/ingredients/mandelic-acid#details) [emollient](/ingredient-functions/emollient) A super common emollient that makes your skin feel nice and smooth. It comes from coconut oil and glycerin, it's light-textured, clear, odorless and non-greasy. It's a nice ingredient that just feels good on the skin, is super well tolerated by every skin type and easy to formulate with. No wonder it's popular. [DMDM Hydantoin](/ingredients/dmdm-hydantoin)- icky [preservative](/ingredient-functions/preservative) A controversial preservative that has formaldehyde-releasing properties. It works great against bacteria and also has mild fungicide abilities. Cosmetic chemist, Colin wrote a [great article about formaldehyde and DMDM Hydantoin](http://colinsbeautypages.co.uk/dmdm-hydantoin/). He writes that formaldehyde is the perfect example of \"the dose makes the poison\" principle. It's a natural stuff that can also be found in fresh fruits and vegetables, and eating it in tiny amounts is totally ok. However, in larger amounts ( [according to Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Formaldehyde) 30 mL of a solution containing 37% formaldehyde) it's deadly. The amount of formaldehyde used in cosmetics either neat or through formaldehyde-releasing preservatives is tiny. Probably that is why the [Cosmetic Ingredient Review Broad](http://www.cir-safety.org/) concluded both in 1988 and in 2008 that DMDM Hydantoin is \"safe as used in cosmetics\". However, [Colins argues](http://colinsbeautypages.co.uk/dmdm-hydantoin/) that in the case of formaldehyde-releasing preservatives, formaldehyde is released slowly and the skin has probably not evolved to deal with that. The lingering formaldehyde might be toxic to the Langerhans Cells that are important for the skin's defense system. Another potential issue is that formaldehyde-releasers might also release other things while reacting with amino acids in the skin that is probably the explanation why some people are not allergic to formaldehyde but are allergic to formaldehyde-releasing preservatives. These are all theories, far from proven facts, but we feel that there are some justified reasons why formaldehyde-releasing preservatives and Dmdm Hydantoin count as controversial. All in all, it's up to you to decide if you wanna avoid this preservative group or not. If so, there are other, less risky and more skin-friendly [options](https://incidecoder.com/ingredient-functions/preservative) out there. [Allantoin](/ingredients/allantoin)- goodie [soothing](/ingredient-functions/soothing)| Irritancy: 0 | Comedogenicity: 0 Super common soothing ingredient. It can be found naturally in the roots & leaves of the comfrey plant, but more often than not what's in the cosmetic products is produced synthetically. It's not only soothing but it' also skin-softening and protecting and can promote wound healing. [antioxidant](/ingredient-functions/antioxidant) We don't have description for this ingredient yet. [Tocopherol](/ingredients/tocopherol)- in our skin - Significant photoprotection against UVB rays - Vit C + Vit E work in synergy and provide great photoprotection - Has emollient properties - Easy to formulate, stable and relatively inexpensive [Read all the geeky details about Tocopherol here >>](/ingredients/tocopherol#details) [buffering](/ingredient-functions/buffering) Citric acid comes from citrus fruits and is an AHA. If these magic three letters don't tell you anything, [click here](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/glycolic-acid) and read our detailed description on glycolic acid, the most famous AHA. So citric acid is an exfoliant, that can - just like other AHAs - gently lift off the dead skin cells of your skin and make it more smooth and fresh. There is also some research showing that citric acid with regular use (think three months and 20% concentration) can help sun-damaged skin, increase skin thickness and some nice hydrating things called glycosaminoglycans in the skin. But according to a comparative study done in 1995, citric acid has less skin improving magic properties than glycolic or lactic acid. Probably that's why citric acid is usually not used as an exfoliant but more as a helper ingredient in small amounts to adjust the pH of a formulation. [Fragrance](/ingredients/parfum)- icky [perfuming](/ingredient-functions/perfuming) Exactly what it sounds: nice smelling stuff put into cosmetic products so that the end product also smells nice. Fragrance in the US and parfum in the EU is a generic term on the ingredient list that is made up of 30 to 50 chemicals on average (but it can have as much as 200 components!). If you are someone who likes to know what you put on your face then fragrance is not your best friend - there's no way to know what's really in it. Also, if your skin is sensitive, fragrance is again not your best friend. It's the number one cause of contact allergy to cosmetics. It's definitely a smart thing to avoid with sensitive skin (and fragrance of any type - natural is just as allergic as synthetic, if not worse!). [colorant](/ingredient-functions/colorant) Ci 19140 or Tartrazine is a super common colorant in skincare, makeup, medicine & food. It's a synthetic lemon yellow that's used alone or mixed with other colors for special shades. [FDA says](http://www.fda.gov/ForConsumers/ConsumerUpdates/ucm048951.htm) it's possible, but rare, to have an allergic-type reaction to a color additive. As an example, it mentions that Ci 19140 may cause itching and hives in some people but the colorant is always labeled so that you can avoid it if you are sensitive. [Retinol](/ingredients/retinol)- superstar [cell-communicating ingredient](/ingredient-functions/cell-communicating-ingredient) - Retinol (pure Vitamin A) is probably the most proven anti-aging ingredient available OTC - It has to be converted in the skin to retinoic acid to work its magic - Once converted, it has the same effect as all-trans-retinoic acid, aka tretinoin - A generally accepted ballpark number is that retinol is 10-to-20 times less potent than retinoic acid - It makes skin less wrinkled, smoother, firmer and tighter - It might also be helpful for acne prone skin as it normalizes keratinization and makes the pores produce less sebum - Possible side effects and irritation are also much less than with retinoic acid - Do not use whilst pregnant [Read all the geeky details about Retinol here >>](/ingredients/retinol#details) [preservative](/ingredient-functions/preservative) It's one of those things that help your cosmetics not to go wrong too soon, aka a preservative. Its strong point is being effective against yeasts and molds, and as a nice bonus seems to be non-comedogenic as well. It is safe in concentrations of less than 0.1% but is acutely toxic when inhaled, so it's not the proper preservative choice for aerosol formulas like hairsprays. Used at 0.1%, Iodopropynyl Butylcarbamate has an extremely low rate of skin-irritation when applied directly for 24 hours (around 0.1% of 4,883 participants) and after 48 hours that figure was 0.5%, so it counts as mild and safe unless your skin is super-duper sensitive.
