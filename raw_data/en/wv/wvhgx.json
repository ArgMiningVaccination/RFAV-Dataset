We recommend that patients follow their doctor's guidance in regard to pain relief. BeActive Plus is an FDA-cleared device to provide relief from sciatic nerve pain. The device works by applying targeted compression to pain sites that the brand claims \"turns off sciatic nerve pain signals for quick relief.\" But is acupressure actually proven in clinical trials to be effective for sciatic pain relief, or pain relief generally? Does FDA-cleared mean the device is proven to work? Are there any risks associated with the use of the BeActive Plus device? And how do real users rate it and describe its effects? In this article we'll answer all of these questions and more as we review clinical trials to give our take on whether or not the BeActive Plus is likely to be effective for pain relief. We'll explain whether FDA-clearance means a device is proven to work and what that term even means, and share real, unsponsored user reviews of BeActive Plus. Does Acupressure Actually Relieve Pain? As stated in the intro section, the technology underlying BeActive Plus is called acupressure. This is a broad term that generally refers to targeted pressure applied to specific pain sites in the body that's meant to relieve pain due to energy transfer. A [medical review](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/23415783/) on the effectiveness of acupressure published in the Pain Management Nursing journal analyzed data from 15 clinical trials and concluded that \"acupressure has been shown to be effective for relieving a variety of pains.\" It's worth noting that the above review mostly analyzed trials that involved acupressure applied with the hands and not with a medical device like the BeActive Plus. Another [medical review](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3749058/) published in 2015 also concluded that acupressure can be effective for natural pain relief, but the study authors noted that \"The selection of which point to target is a key step in acupressure practice, and selection of the correct acupuncture point is essential to achieve good treatment outcomes.\" This suggests that acupressure may not be effective without the guidance of a medical practitioner. A [clinical trial](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/12165194/) examined the effectiveness of an acupressure device (not the BeActive Plus) for managing pain associated with menstruation. The researchers found that the acupressure device decreased pain by 50% in more than two-thirds of the trial participants. Overall it appears based on early research that acupressure is effective for reducing pain. We cannot identify any clinical trials proving that acupressure is effective for treating sciatic nerve pain specifically, nor can we identify any clinical trials on the BeActive Plus device specifically. Does FDA-Cleared Mean BeActive Plus is Proven to Work? There is a difference between FDA clearance and FDA approval that consumers should be aware of. FDA clearance does not necessarily mean that a medical device is proven to be effective. As we documented in our [Relief Band reviews](https://illuminatelabs.org/blogs/health/reliefband-review) article that covered another FDA-cleared device, this designation simply means that the device is \"substantially equivalent\" to another device on the market. In BeActive's case, there is likely another acupressure device that is structurally and functionally similar on the market. FDA approval means that the FDA has actually deemed a product, drug or supplement to be effective based on a review of clinical research. This is a different process than FDA clearance, as outlined by the [FDA's website](https://www.fda.gov/consumers/consumer-updates/it-really-fda-approved). It's a good sign that BeActive Plus has gone through the steps to get their device FDA-cleared, and definitely a sign that indicates legitimacy of the brand and safety of the product, however it does not definitively prove that the device is effective at pain relief. How Do You Use BeActive Plus? A YouTube review published by a physical therapist unboxes the BeActive Plus device, explains how it should be properly applied, and the therapist also gives his take on whether the product is likely to be effective or not: Where to Buy BeActive Plus BeActive Plus is sold both on the official manufacturer's website and on Amazon. There is also a product titled \"BeActive Plus\" currently being sold on Walmart, but this product has a totally different design so we would recommend avoiding it as we cannot confirm that this is the official BeActive Plus device. At the time of writing this article, BeActive Plus is cheaper on Amazon. Here's a website: Real, Unsponsored BeActive User Review The only unsponsored YouTube review we can identify is published by a creator named James White. He forgot to set a thumbnail as you can see below, but the video works, is only two minutes long, and is quite informative as he shares his experience after actually using the device for pain relief: Will BeActive Plus Cause Side Effects? We do not believe that BeActive Plus is likely to cause side effects. As stated previously, the device has been FDA-cleared which means it's somewhat similar to other acupressure device(s) on the market that the FDA has safety data on. If one of these devices was causing side effects in many consumers, the FDA would likely not have cleared BeActive Plus. This device is just an acupressure device that's strapped onto a part of the body that's in pain. It's an external rather than internal device, so logically there isn't much risk of injury or side effects. If the device is causing irritation or discomfort, the user can just remove it. We can't envision any scenario where this device could cause long-term adverse effects. Since BeActive Plus doesn't appear to have been studied in any clinical trials it's impossible to say for sure whether it will cause side effects or not, but our educated guess is that it's safe to use. Can Food-Based Supplements Relieve Pain? Cinnamon is a spice that has been studied for its ability to reduce pain and support joint health. A [clinical trial](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/29722610/) published in the Journal of the American College of Nutrition found that cinnamon supplementation at a daily dose of 500 mg reduced inflammation and joint swelling in patients with rheumatoid arthritis. A 2020 [clinical trial](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/32638445/) found that cinnamon supplementation reduced inflammatory markers. The study authors concluded that \"Cinnamon could be regarded as a safe supplement to relieve pain.\" Illuminate Labs manufactures a [Ceylon Cinnamon Extract](https://illuminatelabs.org/products/ceylon-cinnamon-extract) supplement that's potent (standardized to minimum 8% flavonoids) and third-party tested to ensure purity and label accuracy (test results published transparently on the product page). It only costs $15 for a monthly subscription. Interested consumers can check out Illuminate Labs Ceylon Cinnamon Extract [at this link](https://illuminatelabs.org/products/ceylon-cinnamon-extract). Collagen is the core structural protein in joints. The body produces it naturally, but its production decreases with age. [Medical research](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/18416885/) has shown that collagen can reduce joint pain in athletes at a 10 gram (g) daily dose, and can reduce arthritic pain ( [meta-study](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/30368550/), doses ranging between 40 mg and 10 g daily dose). We recommend [Bulletproof Collagen Powder](https://bulletproof.fdf2.net/c/3271428/1278011/9221) as our top collagen product because it provides an effective collagen dose per serving (20 g) and contains one single ingredient: collagen peptides sourced from grass-fed animals. There are no questionable additives. This supplement only costs $45.16 for over a month's worth of product. Interested consumers can check out Bulletproof Collagen powder [at this link](https://bulletproof.fdf2.net/c/3271428/1278011/9221) to the brand's official website. [Cornbread CBD Lotion](https://activation.healthline.com/api/member-offers/8359/redirect?lp=328&tc=120226&subid=rvosubaff_illuminatelabs) is our top pick for a topical CBD product. CBD is [clinically shown](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC9859876/) to be effectively absorbed through the skin, and CBD caused \"significant improvements in pain\" when applied topically in a 2020 [clinical trial](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/31793418/). This lotion also contains menthol, which was shown in a 2022 [clinical trial](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34552033/) to reduce pain scores. Interested consumers can check out Cornbread CBD Lotion [at this link](https://activation.healthline.com/api/member-offers/8359/redirect?lp=328&tc=120226&subid=rvosubaff_illuminatelabs) to the product page on the official brand's website. We do not recommend using dietary supplements to treat any specific medical condition related to pain, and we recommend that individuals speak with their doctor prior to using any supplement for pain relief. BeActive Plus Real Customer Reviews BeActive Plus is sold on Amazon, which is a more objective resource for customer reviews than a brand's website in our opinion. The top positive review from a verified purchaser comes from a user named \"M. Canada\" who claims that the device is effective for pain relief: \"It works for ME! It reduces the pain and stiffness in my lower back. I sleep in it and wear it to work. It's not needed all the time... just when I have symptoms. It's worth it in my opinion!\" The top negative review from a verified purchaser is written by a user named \"ShayMa\" who claims that the device caused some minor benefit but was not effective overall: \"I believe in order for this to work you must be in the beginning stages of having Sciatica. The person I purchased it for is adamant about the fact that it hasn't helped at all. The only thing is that depending on how tight it is adjusted it may numb the pain,but doesn't necessarily stop the "}
