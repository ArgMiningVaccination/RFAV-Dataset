People Editorial Guidelines Published on April 26, 2023 09:00AM EDT One morning last January, film director Kevin Smith awoke in terror, convinced he was losing his mind. The next day Smith, 52, checked into Arizona's Sierra Tucson treatment center where he spent the next month in intensive therapy, learning how several childhood traumas had led him to create and hide behind a \"larger than life\" public persona he calls \"the other guy\" that eventually usurped his core sense of self. \"It was scary,\" he says, speaking about the incident\u2014that he describes as a \"complete break from reality\"\u2014publicly for the first time in this week's PEOPLE. \"At that moment, I wouldn't have been averse to not being around any longer. I called a friend and said, 'I'm in a weird, dark place. I need to go somewhere and get help.'\" Over four decades have passed since the events\u2014the sexual abuse and the shaming over his weight\u2014left a psychological wound in Smith that he has spent his life trying to compensate.

But spending hours a day in private and group therapy sessions, often surrounded by military veterans struggling with PTSD, wasn't easy\u2014at least not at first. \"In the beginning, it was tough to share when somebody's talking about watching their friend get killed and I'm like, 'Well, my fourth-grade teacher told me I was fat,'\" recalls Smith. \"But I learned that there's no differentiation [between levels of trauma] to the human nervous system.
