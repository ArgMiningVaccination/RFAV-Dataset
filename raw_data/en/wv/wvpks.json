Vol. 08-1Preface The Idaho Administrative Bulletin is published once each month by the Department of Administration, Office of the Administrative Rules Coordinator, pursuant to Section 67-5203, Idaho Code. The Bulletin is a monthly compilation of all administrative rule-making documents in Idaho. The Bulletin publishes the official rulemaking notices and administrative rule text of state agency rulemakings and other official documents as necessary. State agencies are required to provide public notice of rulemaking activity and invite public input. The public receives notice of rulemaking activity through the Idaho Administrative Bulletin and the Legal Notice published monthly in local newspapers. The Legal Notice provides reasonable opportunity for public input, either oral or written, which may be presented to the agency within the time and manner specified in the Rulemaking Notice published in the Bulletin. After the comment period closes, the agency considers fully all information submitted in regard to the rule. Comment periods are not provided in temporary or final rule-making activities. CITATION TO THE IDAHO ADMINISTRATIVE BULLETIN The Bulletin is cited by year and issue number. For example, Bulletin 06-1 refers to the first Bulletin issued in calendar year 2006 ; Bulletin 07-1 refers to the first Bulletin issued in calendar year 2007 . Volume numbers, which proceed from 1 to 12 in a given year, correspond to the months of publication, i.e.; Volume No. 07-1 refers to January 2007; Volume No. 07-2 refers to February 2007; and so forth. Example: The Bulletin published in January of 2007 is cited as Volume 07-1. The December 2006 Bulletin is cited as Volume 06-12 . RELATIONSHIP TO THE IDAHO ADMINISTRATIVE CODE The Idaho Administrative Code is published once a year and is a compilation or supplemental compilation of all final and enforceable administrative rules in effect in Idaho. In an effort to provide the reader with current, enforceable rules, temporary rules are also published in the Administrative Code. Temporary rules and final rules approved by the legislature during the legislative session, and published in the monthly Idaho Administrative Bulletin, supplement the Administrative Code. Negotiated, proposed, and pending rules are only published in the Bulletin and not printed in the Administrative Code. To determine if a particular rule remains in effect, or to determine if a change has occurred, the reader should refer to the Cumulative Rulemaking Index of Idaho Administrative Rules , printed in each Bulletin. TYPES OF RULEMAKINGS PUBLISHED IN THE ADMINISTRATIVE BULLETIN The state of Idaho administrative rulemaking process, governed by the Administrative Procedure Act, Title 67, Chapter 52, Idaho Code, comprises five distinct activities: negotiated, proposed, temporary, pending and final rulemaking. Not all rulemakings involve all five. At a minimum, a rulemaking includes proposed, pending and final rulemaking. Many rules are adopted as temporary rules when they meet the required statutory criteria and agencies often engage in negotiated rulemaking at the beginning of the process to facilitate consensus building in controversial or complex rulemakings. In the majority of cases, the process begins with proposed rulemaking and ends with the final rulemaking. The following is a brief explanation of each type of administrative rule. NEGOTIATED RULEMAKING Negotiated rulemaking is a process in which all interest ed parties and the agency seek consensus on the content of a rule. Agencies are encouraged, and in some cases requ ired, to engage in this rulemaking activity whenever it is feasible to do so. Publication of a \"Notice of Intent to Promulgate\" a rule in the Administrative Bulletin by the agency is optional. This process should result in the formulation of a proposed and/or temporary rule.IDAHO ADMINISTRATIVE BULLETIN PREFACE Idaho Administrative Bulletin Page 10 January 2, 2008 - Vol. 08-1PROPOSED RULEMAKING A proposed rulemaking is an action by an agency wherein the agency is proposing to amend or repeal an existing rule or to adopt a new rule. Prior to the adoption, amendment, or repeal of a rule, the agency must publish a \"Notice of Proposed Rulemaking\" in the Bulletin. This notice must include: a) the specific statutory authority (from Idaho Code) for the rulemaking including a citation to a specific federal statute or regulation if that is the basis of authority or requirement for the rulemaking; b) a statement in nontechnical language of the substance of the proposed rule, including a specific description of any fee or charge imposed or increased; c) the text of the proposed rule prepared in legislative format; d) the location, date, and time of any public hearings the agency intends to hold on the proposed rule; e) the manner in which persons may make written co mments on the proposed rule, including the name and address of a person in the agency to whom comments on the proposal may be sent; f) the manner in which persons may request an opportunity for an oral presentation as provided in Section 67-5222, Idaho Code; and g) the deadline for public (written) comments on the proposed rule. As stated, the text of the proposed rule must be published in the Bulletin. After meeting the statutory rulemaking criteria for a proposed rule, the agency may proceed to the pending rule stage. A proposed rule does not have an assigned effective date unless published in conjunction w ith a temporary rule. An agency may vacate a proposed rulemaking if it decides not to proceed further with the promulgation process. TEMPORARY RULEMAKING Temporary rules may be adopted only when the governor finds that it is necessary for: a) protection of the public health, safety, or welfare; or b) compliance with deadlines in amendments to governing law or federal programs; orc) conferring a benefit; If a rulemaking meets any one or all of the above requir ements, a rule may become effective before it has been submitted to the legislature for review and the agency may proceed and adopt a temporary rule. However, a temporary rule that imposes a fee or charge may be adopte d only if the Governor finds that the fee or charge is necessary to avoid an immediate danger which justifies the imposition of the fee or charge. A temporary rule expires at the conclusion of the next succeeding regular legislative session unless the rule is approved, amended, or modified by concurrent resolution or when the rule has been replaced by a final rule. State law requires that the text of both a proposed rule and a temporary rule be published in the Administrative Bulletin. In cases where the text of the temporary rule is the same as the proposed rule, the rulemaking can be done concurrently as a proposed/temporary rule. Combining the rulemaking allows for a single publication of the text. An agency may, at any time, rescind a temporary rule that has been adopted and is in effect. If the temporary rule is being replaced by a new temporary rule or if it has been published concurrently with a proposed rule that is being vacated, the agency, in most instances, should rescind the temporary rule.IDAHO ADMINISTRATIVE BULLETIN PREFACE Idaho Administrative Bulletin Page 11 January 2, 2008 - Vol. 08-1PENDING RULEMAKING A pending rule is a rule that has been adopted by an agency under regular rulemaking procedures and remains subject to legislative review before it becomes a final, enforceable rule. When a pending rule is published in the Bulletin, the agency is required to include certain information in the \"Notice of Pending Rulemaking\". This includes: a) a statement giving the reasons for adopting the rule; b) a statement of any change between the text of the proposed rule and the pending rule with an explanation of the reasons for any changes; c) the date the pending rule will become final and effective; d) an identification of any portion of the rule imposing or increasing a fee or charge. Agencies are required to republish the text of the rule wh en substantive changes have been made to the proposed rule. An agency may adopt a pending rule that varies in content from that which was originally proposed if the subject matter of the rule remains the same, the pending rule change is a logical outgrowth of the proposed rule, and the original notice was written so as to assure that members of the public were reasonably notified of the subject. It is not always necessary to republish all the text of the pending rule. With the permission of the Rules Coordinator, only the Section(s) that have changed from the proposed text are re published. If no changes have been made to the previously published text, it is not required to republish the text again and only the \"Notice of Pending Rulemaking\" is published. FINAL RULEMAKING A final rule is a rule that has been adopted by an agency under the regular rulemaking procedures and is in effect and enforceable. No pending rule adopted by an agency will become final and effective until it has been submitted to the legislature for review. Where the legislature finds that an agency has violated the legislative intent of the statute under which the rule was made, a concurrent resolution may be adopted to reject the rulemaking or any part thereof. A \"Notice of Final Rule\" must be published in the Bulletin for any rule that is rejected, amended, or modified by the legislature showing the changes made. A rule reviewed by the legislature and not rejected, amended or modified becomes final with no further legislative action. No rule shall become final and effective before the conclusion of the regular or special legislative session at which the rule wa s submitted for review. However, a rule that is final and effective may be applied retroactively, as provided in the rule.

Internet Access - The Administrative Code and Administrative Bulletin are available on the Internet at the following address : http://adm.idaho.gov/adminrules/ HOW TO USE THE IDAHO ADMINISTRATIVE BULLETIN Rulemaking documents produced by state agencies and published in the Idaho Administrative Bulletin are organized by a numbering system. Each state agency has a two-digit identification code number known as the \"IDAPA\" number. (The \"IDAP A\" Codes are listed in the alphabetical/numerical index at the end of this Preface.) Within each agency there are divisions or departments to which a two-digit \"TITLE\" number is assigned. There are \"CHAPTER\" numbers assigned within the Title and the rule text is divided among major sections with a number of subsections. An example IDAP A number is as follows: IDAPA 38.05.01.200.02.c.ii. \"IDAPA\" refers to Administrative Rules in general that are subject to the Administrative Procedures Act and are required by this act to be published in the Idaho Administrative Code and the Idaho Administrative Bulletin. \"38.\" refers to the Idaho Department of Administration \"05.\" refers to Title 05, which is the Department of Administrations' s Division of Purchasing \"01.\" refers to Chapter 01 of Title 05, \"Rules of the Division of Purchasing\" \"200.\" refers to Major Section 200, \"Content of the Invitation to Bid\" \"02.\" refers to Subsection 200. 02. \"c.\" c. \"ii.\" refers to Subsection 200.02.c. ii.IDAHO ADMINISTRATIVE BULLETIN PREFACE Idaho Administrative Bulletin Page 13 January 2, 2008 - Vol. 08-1DOCKET NUMBERING SYSTEM Internally, the Bulletin is organized sequentially using a rule docketing system. All rulemaking actions (documents) are assigned a \"DOCKET NUMBER.\" The \"Docket Number\" is a series by a hyphen \"-\", ( 38-0501-0701 ). The docket numbers are published sequentially by IDAP A designation (e.g. the two- digit agency code). The following example is a breakdown of a typical rule docket number: \"DOCKET NO. 38-0501-0701\" \"38-\" denotes the agency's this case the Department of Administration. \"0501-\" refers to the TITLE AND CHAPTER numbers of the agency rule being promulgated; in this case the Division of Purchasing (TITLE 05), Rules of the Division of Purchasing (Chapter 01). \"0701\" denotes the year and sequential order of the docket being published; in this case the numbers refer to the first rule-making action published in calendar year 2007 . A subsequent rulemaking on this same rule chapter in calendar year 2007 would be designated as \" 0702 \". The docket number in this scenario would be 38-0501- 0702 . Within each Docket, only the affected sections of chapters are printed. (See Sections Affected Index in each Bulletin for a listing of these.) The individual sections affected are printed in the Bulletin sequentially (e.g. Section \"200\" appears before Section \"345\" and so on). Whenever the sequence of the numbering is broken the following statement will appear: (BREAK IN CONTINUITY OF SECTIONS) INTERNAL AND EXTERNAL CITATIONS TO ADMINISTRATIVE RULES IN THE CODE AND BULLETIN When making a citation to another Section or Subsection of a rule that is part of the same rule, a typical internal citation may appear as follows: \"...as found in Section 201 of this rule.\" OR \"...in accordance with Subsection 201.06.c. of this rule.\" The citation may also include the IDAP A, Title, or Chapter number, as the TITLE number of the rule. \"01\" denotes the Chapter number of the rule. \"201\" denotes the main Section number of the rule to which the citation refers. Citations made within a rule to a different rule chapter (external citation) should also include the name of the Department and the name of the rule chapter being referenced, as well as the IDAP A, Title, and Chapter numbers. The following is a typical example of an external citation to another rule chapter: \"...as outlined in the Rules of the Department of Administration, IDAPA 38.04.04, \"Rules Governing Capitol Mall Parking.\"IDAHO ADMINISTRATIVE BULLETIN PREFACE Idaho Administrative Bulletin Page 14 January 2, 2008 -

DESCRIPTIVE SUMMARY: The following is a concise explanatory statement of the reasons for adopting the pending rule and amending the temporary rule and a statemen t of any change between the text of the proposed rule and the text of the pending rule with an explanation of the reasons for the change. Public hearing testimony was received on this rule and an amendment to the rule was made based on that feedback: The Idaho Technology Competency Assessment (ITCA) is no longer a relevant measurement of necessary technology requirements in Idaho classrooms. The original intention of the ITCA was to ensure that Idaho educators were proficient with basic technology. All teachers who we re certificated prior to 2006 have passed this exam. Idaho teacher preparation program evaluations include an assessmen t of the integration of relevant technology that covers the intention of the original ITCA. New teachers entering the classroom are far more proficient in technology than is minimally required by the ITCA. Technology competency will be assessed on a case by case basis and mandated only according to individual district requirem ents. It is the state's intent that certificated personnel are technologically competent and integrate technology into the classroom. Based on public hearing testimony, this rule has been amended. Specifically, \"demonstrate profic iency\" has been more clearly defined. The text of the pending rule has been amended in accordance with Section 67-5227, Idaho Code, and is being republished following this notice. Rath er than keep the temporary rule in place while the pending rule awaits legislative approval, the Department has amended the temporary rule with the same revisions which have been made to the pending rule. Only the sections that have changes differ from the proposed text are printed in this bulletin. The original text of the proposed rule was published in the August 1, 2007 Idaho Administrative Bulletin, V ol. 07-8, pages 50 through 52.

DESCRIPTIVE SUMMARY: The following is a concise explanatory statement of the reasons for adopting the pending rule and a statement of any change between the text of the proposed rule and the text of the pending rule with an explanation of the reasons for the change: The Department has reviewed and given due consideratio n to the public comments submitted for this rule. The comments expressed several concerns including new requir ements for prior authorization of speech therapy and occupational therapy, a plan for reviewing the requests for pr ior authorization, the potential for increased cost to the state, as well as the increased potential for fraud and abuse. The Department worked closely with the Idaho Occ upational Therapy Associatio n and the Idaho Speech and Hearing Association to develop rules that will increase access and ensure that participants will receive the right care at the right time, and, at the same time, prevent over-uti lization of therapy services. The Department has conducted research on expected utilization, and there are processes in place to achieve the added responsibilities in a timely manner and to monitor for over-utilization.

The complete text of the proposed rule was published in Book 1 of the Wednesday, October 3, 2007, Idaho Administrative Bulletin, Vol. 07-10, pages 437 through 452. FISCAL IMPACT: The following is a specific description, if app licable, of any negative fi scal impact on the state general fund greater than ten thousand dollars ($10,000) during the fiscal year: This rule change requires updates to Medicaid's automated billing system estimated to cost $125,000. However, no net increase in trustee and benefit costs are anticipated as a result of this rule change. No new services will be implemented with this rule change. Rather, a new provider type will be allowed to bill for therapy services. The improved acces s to therapy services that may re sult from this change may increase utilization of these services. However, the proposed rule change also sets new limits on the amount of therapy services that can be provided without pr ior authorization. It is an ticipated that the increased access to therapy services in conjunction with limitations on therapy visits as a result of the prior authorization review will off-set each other.

AUTHORITY: In compliance with Sections 67-5226, Idaho Code, notice is hereby given this agency has adopted a temporary rule. The action is authorized pursuant to Sections 16-2433, 19-2524, 20-520(i), 20-511A, 39-3137, and 39-309, SCHEDULE: Public hearing(s) concerning this rulemaking will be scheduled if requested in writing by twenty-five (25) persons, a political subdivision, or an agency, not later than January 16, 2008. The hearing site(s) will be accessible to persons with di sabilities. Requests for accommodation must be made not later than five (5) days prior to the hearing, to the agency address below. DESCRIPTIVE SUMMARY: The following is the required finding and concise statement of its supporting reasons for adopting a temporary rule: This new chapter of rules updates the sliding fee scales for the adult mental health, children's mental health, and alcohol and substance use disorders programs and aligns th em with the most current ve rsion of the federal poverty guidelines. This chapter also implements a fee schedule for persons convicted of a felony or serving on probation or parole. TEMPORARY RULE JUSTIFICATION: Pursuant to Section 67-5226(1)(b), Idaho Code, the Governor has found that temporary adoption of the rule is appropriate because legislation passed during the 2007 Legislature (SB 1149) that requires the Department to implement a fee schedule for persons convicted of a felony or serving on probation or parole. FEE SUMMARY: Pursuant to Section 67-5226(2), the Governor has found that the fee or charge being imposed or increased is justified and necessary to avoid immediate danger and the fee is described herein: Felony offenders in need of assessment, evaluation, and tr eatment services are being required to pay for a portion of their treatment based on their ability to pay. This rulemaking sets the schedule for these sliding fees based on federal poverty guidelines. Without this rule, access to serv ices may be limited which increases the risk for offenders to endanger themselves and others. FISCAL IMPACT: The following is a specific description, if appli cable, of any fiscal impact on the state general fund greater than ten thousand dollars ($10,000) during the fiscal year. The fiscal impact of this change is a decrease of $2,1 26 in fee collection for Children's Mental Health services, which must be met by state general funds. The estimated fi scal impact on receipts collect ed for Adult Mental Health services is $33,672. This fiscal impact is a decrease in collection of fees for the Adult Mental Health services. Neither of these funds will be replaced. There is no anticipated fiscal impact to the alcohol and substance disorders program. Changes to the computerized billing system to update the current fee table used by the Daily Activity Report (DAR) automated system will be required. The estimated cost to update the fee table will be an annual cost of approximately $1000.NEGOTIATED RULEMAKING: Pursuant to IDAPA 04.11.01.811, negotiated rulemaking was not conducted because this rulemaking is being implemented to m eet the requirements of newly-passed legislation .

DESCRIPTIVE SUMMARY: The following is the required finding and concise statement of its supporting reasons for adopting a temporary rule and a nontechnical explan ation of the substance and purpose of the proposed rulemaking: In accordance with Executive Order 2006-18, the Department created a new Division of Behavioral Health. This new division is responsible for administering alcohol and su bstance use disorders services for adults and adolescents. Currently, there is no chapter pertaining to the oversight of alcohol and substance use disorders services and this new chapter is needed to fill that void. This rulemaking is primarly being done because there is no formal appeal process in rule for adults or adolescents seeking services from the Department. This rulema king provides this appeal process benefit and outlines how to appeal a denial of services decision made by the Department. This chapter also defines the scope of voluntary alcohol and substance use disorders services and descri bes the eligibility criteria, application requirements, individualized treatment plan, and sel ection of providers under these rules. TEMPORARY RULE JUSTIFICATION: Pursuant to Section 67-5226(1)(c), Idaho Code, the Governor has found that temporary adoption of the rule is approp riate as this rulemaking confers a benefit. FEE SUMMARY: Pursuant to Section 67-5226(2), the Governor has found that the fee or charge being imposed or increased is justified and necessary to avoid imme diate danger and the fee is described herein: N/A FISCAL IMPACT: The following is a specific description, if appli cable, of any fiscal impact on the state general fund greater than ten thousand dollars ($10,000) during the fiscal year. This rulemaking has no anticipated fiscal impact to the state general fund. NEGOTIATED RULEMAKING: Pursuant to IDAPA 04.11.01.811, negotiated rulemaking was not conducted because this new chapter was developed primarily to estab lish the benefit of appeal ri ghts for individuals receiving alcohol and substance use disorders services under these rules. ASSISTANCE ON TECHNICAL QUESTIONS, SUBMISSION OF WRITTEN COMMENTS: For assistance on technical questions concerning the temporary and pr oposed rule, contact Bethany Gadzinski, Division of Behavioral Health, at (208) 334-5756.

AUTHORITY: In compliance with Idaho Code Section 67-5224 and IDAPA 20.01.01, Rules of Practice and Procedure Before the State Board of Land Commissioners (\"Board\"), Sections 830 through 835, notice is hereby given that this agency has adopted a pending rule. This action is authorized pursuant to Section 58-104(6), Idaho Code. DESCRIPTIVE SUMMARY: The following is a concise explanatory statement of the reasons for adopting the pending rule and a statement of any change between the text of the proposed rule and the text of the pending rule with an explanation of the reasons for the change: The new rules are intended to implem ent changes in Section 58-1307, Idah o Code that increased application fees. The increase in fees is intended to cover the departme nt's program costs. The rules also eliminate conflicts with Idaho Code Sections 58-1301, et seq. and the rules are reorganized to make them more understandable. These changes will also reduce the amount of time and money the department spends on the program. Encroachment standards are centralized in the new rule s and expanded to address the issues th at are currently facing the department. These issues include floathome sanitation, demolition, and allowing some amount of private moorage at commercial marinas. These rules are being promulgated in conjunction with changes to IDAPA 20.03.17, Rules Governing Leases on State-Owned Submerged Lands and Formerly Submerged Lands. Some changes were made to the pending rules after the close of comments on October 24, 2007. These changes are largely in response to comments received from th e public. The definition of \"commercial navigational encroachment\" was modified to make it more general. A new definition of \"commercial marina\" was added. The term \"commercial navigational encroachme nt\" was then placed in the standards for encroachment le ngths and in the application section. The standards for community docks an d commercial marinas were mo dified and reorganized to clarify the distinctions between public and private moorage and remove some potential conflicts between paragraphs. Locked gates will be allowed on public moorage to address security concerns. Commercial marinas that convert to community docks must meet all the community dock standards. Parking requirements were modified to apply to all moorage at commercial marinas. Pursuant to Section 67-5 228, Idaho Code, typographical, transcriptional, and/or clerical corrections have also been made to the rule and ar e being published with this Notice of Rulemaking as part of the pending rule.

AUTHORITY: In compliance with Section 67-5226, Idaho Code, notice is hereby given that this agency has rescinded the temporary rule previously adopted under this docket. The action is authorized pursuant to Sections 59- 1314(1) and 72-1405, Idaho Code. DESCRIPTIVE SUMMARY: The following is a concise explanatory st atement of the reasons for rescinding the temporary rule: Section 59-1322(1), Idaho Code, requires the Retirement Board (Board) to establish contribution rates to adequately fund the retirement system, subject to certain requirements. In 2003, the Board adopted proposed rules that provided for a series of three annual contribution rate increases beginning July 1, 2004, through July 1, 2006. The first of those increases went into effect, but favorable ma rket conditions significantly improved the funding status of the plan and in 2005 the board postponed the two subsequent increases for one year, until July 1, 2006, and July 1 2007, respectively. In 2006 the Board again postponed the increases until July 1, 2007, and July 1, 2008, respectively. In 2007 the Board postponed the increases a third time until July 1, 2008, and July 1, 2009, respectively. Due to favorable market conditions and based on actuarial data, the Board has now determined that the two additional increases scheduled for July 1, 2008 and July 1, 2009, are no longer needed to adequately fund the plan. The Board will continue to monitor funding and market conditions and will take addition action if appropriate. The current contribution rates will continue as reflected in a new temporary and proposed rule in docket number 59-0103-0801, effective February 1, 2008. This temporary rule is rescinded the same day, effective February 1, 2008.

DESCRIPTIVE SUMMARY: The following is the required finding and concise statement of its supporting reasons for adopting a temporary rule and a nontechnical explan ation of the substance and purpose of the proposed rulemaking: Section 59-1322(1), Idaho Code, requires the Retirement Board to establish contribution rates within certain constraints. The Board has reviewed and determined, based on actuarial valuation of reserves and liabilities, the contributions necessary to fund the level of benefits auth orized by the plan. In 2003, the Board adopted proposed rules that provided for a series of three annual contribution rate increases beginning July 1, 2004, through July 1, 2006. The first of those increases went into effect, but favorable market conditions significantly improved the funding status of the plan and in 2005 the board postponed, through temporary rules, the two subsequent increases for one year, until July 1, 2006, and July 1 2007, respectively. In 2006 the Board again postponed the increases, through temporary rules, until July 1, 2007, and July 1, 2008, respectively. In 2007 the Board postponed the increases a third time through temporary rules until July 1, 2008, and July 1, 2009, respectively. Due to continued favorable market conditions and based on actuarial data, the Board has now determined that the two additional increases scheduled for July 1, 2008 and July 1, 2009, are no longer needed to ad equately fund the plan. The Bo ard will continue to monitor funding and market conditions and will take subsequent action regarding contribution rates if appropriate. The current contribution rates will continue as reflected in these rules, effective February 1, 2008. Temporary rules published in docket number 59-0103-0701 are being rescinded effective February 1, 2008, by a separate notice in this volume of the Idaho Administrative Bulletin. These rules continue the current rates until further modified by the board. TEMPORARY RULE JUSTIFICATION: Pursuant to Sections 67-5226(1), Idaho Code, the Governor has found that temporary adoption of the rule is appropriate for the following reasons: This rule change will confer a benefit on PERSI employees and employers. FEE SUMMARY: The following is a specific description of the fee or charge imposed or increased: N/A FISCAL IMPACT: The following is a specific description, if appli cable, of any negative fiscal impact on the state general fund greater than ten thousand dollars ($10,000) during the fiscal year: There is no negative fiscal impact. NEGOTIATED RULEMAKING: Pursuant to IDAPA 04.11.01.811, negotiated rulemaking was not conducted because the Retirement Board has exclusive fi duciary responsibility for plan operations.
