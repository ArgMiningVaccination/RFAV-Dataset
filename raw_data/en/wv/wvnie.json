Higher coal prices and a weaker rupee forced them to cut generation. At the same time, plants that use domestic coal saw a 35 percent spurt in imports as they tried to bridge a shortfall in domestic supply. A court order last year barred some Indian power plants that use imported coal and have fixed-tariff contracts from passing on an increase in fuel costs to customers. Adani Power Ltd.'s 4.6 GW plant at Mundra in Gujarat, which runs mostly on imported coal, used merely 6 percent of its capacity during April and May, power ministry data show. Essar Power's 1.2 GW imported coal-fired generator in the same state was closed during the months. Average thermal coal prices at Australia's Newcastle port, considered an Asian benchmark, have risen about 25 percent in the period from a year ago. While the government seeks to discourage imports of thermal coal and sees the decline as an achievement, rising domestic supplies are failing to keep pace with demand. Plants designed to run on Indian coal are now increasingly importing the fuel for blending, as state miner CIL fails to meet requirements. The Power Minister asked state generators, who had earlier been advised to curtail coal imports, to buy from overseas if they needed to as shortages continued to persist. India's power plants imported 8.64 mt of coal in the two months ended May, compared with 10.13 mt a year earlier. Plants that run exclusively on imported coal, accounted for most of the imports at 5.07 mt while those using domestic coal purchased 3.57 mt from overseas during the period this year. The advisory from the power ministry to import coal comes in the wake of states demanding more coal to run their thermal units in face of growing demand. In Tamil Nadu, power demand shot up by 2383 MW this summer. If TANGEDCO is to import five mt of coal to meet the shortage, it would cost the state discom around $5,000. The coal consumption during April 2018 increased by 3.9% compared this year. TANGEDCO started importing coal regularly from 2004-05. The imports started in 2004-05 at one mt but as the demand for power increased and more thermal units were commissioned, the amount of coal imported also increased. In 2016, Coal India Limited requested Tamil Nadu government to advise TANGEDCO to stop imports and use indigenous coal available with CIL. Increasing coal import by power plants to compensate for supply shortages by CIL would lead to a rise in electricity tariffs, analysts said. Absorbing higher imported fuel costs by electricity discoms, instead of raising tariffs, would add to losses of such state-owned entities. Reining in costs of electricity generation at state-owned power plants was a major factor which enabled discoms under the UDAY to halve their financial losses to 173.52 billion in FY18. Power plants which blend domestic and imported coal to increase efficiency imported 3.6 mt of coal in the first two months of FY19, which is 39% more than the same period in FY18. The development comes at a time when global coal prices have gone up by more than 23% CAGR from FY16 to about $100/tonne. Research firm India Ratings estimates that if there is a 6-7% rise in electricity demand, imported coal needs to increase to 62 mt in FY19 from 56 mt, even if coal availability to the power sector increases by the standard 4% rate. Overall coal imports are, however, lower than last year because a number of power plants designed to run only on imported coal have shut down their units after the Supreme Court ruled in April 2017 that imported coal price hikes cannot be passed on to discoms through higher tariffs. However, power plants with supply contacts with CIL can claim compensation for higher costs for coal imported due to less than contracted supply. CIL has increased its supplies to the power sector by 15.4% to 122.8 mt in the first three months of FY19, backed by a 15% growth in rake loading to 217 rakes per day. However, supply shortages remain. CIL said it has registered a 15.2 percent growth in coal production during the first quarter ended June 2018 to 136.87 mt. While the offtake was spurred by higher rake loading, the overall coal offtake zoomed to 153.43 mt at the end of June, translating into a growth of 11.7 percent. CIL announced that the number of power stations having critical stock has come down from 30 at the beginning of the fiscal to 16 as of June 2018. Of the overall coal supplies of the company during the first quarter ending June, supplies to the power sector accounted for 80 percent and CIL said that a request has been made to thermal power plants to boost their coal stocksData available with the Central Electricity Authority shows that seven power projects have less than seven days coal, while eight are operating with less than four days stock. Power sector accounted for 80 percent of coal supplies during the period. CIL has been working with the Coal and Railways ministries for enhanced rake loading of 217.04 rakes per day on an average to the power sector during the first quarter of FY'19 against 189.9 rakes in the same period last year, registering a growth of 14.9 percent. The company produced 44.88 mt in June 2018, reflecting an increase of 5.20 mt in absolute terms over corresponding month of last year. The company liquidated 16.56 mt of its pit head coal stock during the first three months of the current fiscal. Ahead of the paddy season during which power generation at privately-owned case II projects has been hit by shortage of coal, the Punjab government has written to the union ministry of coal to consider these plants at par with the state-owned thermal stations while allocating the fuel stocks. The state government stated that being case II projects, the 1,400 MW Rajpura thermal plant and the 1,920 MW Talwandi Sabo thermal plant sell entire electricity generated to meet the state's demand and forced shut down of these affects the availability of power forcing the corporation to go in for regulatory measures, including power cuts. Punjab State Power Corp Ltd has allowed the Talwandi Sabo plant and the Rajpura plant to import 3 lakh and 2 lakh metric tonnes of coals to meet the fuel requirements during the paddy season. Delhi has warned of blackout in the national capital claiming that in Badarpur and Dadri I and II power plants just two days coal reserve was left. The railways and the Coal India were claiming that the fuel was being supplied. Load shedding faced in June was the \"lowest\" when the city's electricity demand hit an all-time high. The power subsidy scheme for tenants is also likely to be announced soon. Delhi's peak electricity demand had hit an \"all-time high\" of 6,934 MW this summer at 3:28 pm on June 8. The city government has been planning to extend power subsidy scheme to tenants through \"prepaid electricity meters\". Under the power subsidy scheme, the Delhi government provides 50 percent subsidy on electricity tariffs up to 400 units on domestic electricity connections for all residents of Delhi. About 600 transformers have been installed in and \"150 more transformers would be installed till year end\". On the other hand MAHAGENCO, the state-run power generation company that regularly complains of coal shortage is now selling its share of coal to private companies. Its own plants are generating at half load even as private companies are making hay. These claims apart, four power plants of MAHAGENCO\u2014 Bhusawal, Nasik, Paras and Parli \u2014 have alarmingly low coal stock at present. When power plants have very less coal they do not generate at full capacity. Bhusawal has two days stock and its coal is being sold to private companies. Nasik has only one day's stock. A public interest litigation in the high court on coal shortage in Mahagenco power plants, expressed shock over this revelation. Customs, Excise and Service Tax Appellate Tribunal has set aside an order that imposed penalties of 175 million and 12.5 million on Delhi-based Knowledge Infrastructure Systems Private Ltd and its promoter respectively. They are accused of inflating the value of coal imports from Indonesia. In February 2017, the company appealed in the tribunal against the order passed by the adjudicating authority. The GSPCB granted fresh consent to operate to SWPL, a unit of Jindal Steel Work, to handle 400,000 tonnes of coal per month at MPT. The board restricted Adani Mormugao Port Terminal Pvt Ltd to handle 400,000 tonnes of coal per month at the port. The decision to allow coal handling was taken in view of the source appropriation study conducted by IIT-Mumbai to ascertain the cause of pollution in the port town. Coal operations should commence in the port town so that the cause of air pollution in Vasco can be ascertained. The board has permitted SWPL to handle 0.4 mt of coal for next nine months at berths 5A and 6. Adani will also handle 400,000 tonnes of coal at the port. Adani had never exhausted its permissible limit. Adani used to earlier handle 520,000 tonnes. The board has reduced 25% of coal handling of Adani, and they have approached the board to enhance their coal handling limit. The board allowed MPT to handle varied cargo at its offshore cargo handling facility, mooring dolphin, barring coal. GSPCB also allowed the port to handle varied cargo at berth 9. MPT used to handle iron ore at this berth and as a result of iron ore stoppage, the port had approached the board to grant them consent to operate other cargo for financial stability. The government is planning to offload a stake in state-run CIL to speed asset sales. The Department of Investment and Public Asset Management is finalizing the amount of stake to be offered in the financial year ending March 31. If needed, the government could explore the option of staggering the sale offer in two tranches. The government's plan to raise about $12 billion in the current year from asset sales is at risk after a high-profile plan to sell Air India ground to a halt as no prospective suitors emerged. CIL has reported strong shipment numbers in recent months due to demand from power plants. The government holds more than 78 percent in CIL. It had previously sold a 10 percent stake in January 2015, mopping up 225.5 billion. Coal Mine Surveillance and Management System and the mobile App \"Khan Prahari\" designed to prevent pilferage of coal and its illegal mining has been launched. Rest of the World A vessel carrying a shipment of coal from the US switched its destination to Singapore from China, according to ship tracking data, amid an escalating trade row between the world's top two economies. The cargo was loaded on the Navios Taurus in Mobile, Alabama, on May 28 and had been due to arrive in China on July 18, but is now due to land in Singapore on July 13, data shows. One of the other vessels, called Partnership, reached China. China has threatened hefty import tariffs on 659 US products. Duties will start on some 545 items, but the government has not specified when coal and the remaining products could be hit. Earlier, a vessel carrying 164,000 tonnes of coal from the US reached Caofeidian port in northern China, ship tracking data showed. The vessel named Partnership is on schedule, while Beijing plans to impose steep tariffs next month on a list of US products, including thermal coal and coking coal due to mounting trade friction between the world's two leading economies. At least three US coal shipments, including Partnership, are on their way to China, but traders are worried they may end up casualties of the escalating trade dispute. The other two vessels, Navios Taurus and West Trader, are expected to arrive at Jingtang port on July 18 and August 10 respectively, according to data. US coal mining companies are worried President Donald Trump's intensifying trade dispute with China could hurt their booming export business, one of the ailing sector's most important lifelines, according to industry players. Beijing added coal and other energy products to a list of US goods facing import tariffs in retaliation for Trump administration levies. For instance, traders said China National Building Material International, one of the biggest metallurgical coal importers in China, pulled back from supply talks with US coal broker XCoal and miner Consol Energy shortly after Beijing's announcement. Consol had been in talks with China to supply up to 1 million tons per year of metallurgical coal but would not confirm whether the deal would be delayed. The US Energy Information Administration said US coal exports to Asia doubled from 15.7 mt in 2016 to 32.8 mt in 2017. Exports to China totaled 3.2 mt in 2017, up from zero in 2015 and 2016, according to the Energy Information Administration. The coal industry's concerns mirror the unease spreading in US farm country over unintended consequences of the Trump administration's protectionist stance, which has roiled foreign market for American crops. The farm and coal industries are critical Trump supporters that the president and his Republican party are relying on to help them retain control of Congress in the mid-term elections in November. The addition of coal to the list of more than 650 items facing higher tariffs from China also came as a shock to Chinese steel mills and trading firms. Just last month, Beijing had been encouraging them to buy more US coal to narrow the trade gap. Coal operators like Pennsylvania's Consol had been in talks with Chinese buyers, and hope those talks revive. Australian thermal coal prices have broken through $120/tonne for the first time since 2012, driven up by strong consumption in Asia and spot market buying by Japanese utilities to meet demand through the rest of 2018. Thermal coal cargoes for prompt export from Australia's Newcastle port last settled at $120.10/tonne. That's the highest close since November 2012 and up by 140 percent from record contract lows in late 2015/early 2016. The price surge has been driven by strong demand from China to feed healthy power demand and industrial growth, despite a drive to shift industry and millions of households from coal to cleaner natural gas. The major coal producing province of Shanxi in northern China will impose special emissions restrictions on big industrial sectors by October as part of its bid to curb smog. The province produces more than 900 mt of coal a year, a quarter of China's total, and is also a major gas and petrochemical producer. China promised in January to impose \"special emissions restrictions\" on major industrial sectors in 28 cities in northern China, including the four in Shanxi. It said firms that failed to comply with the deadlines would be fined, ordered to renovate or shut down completely. The 28 cities were all part of a special winter anti-smog campaign that began in October last year and imposed tough restrictions on traffic, coal consumption and industrial output. In its air quality plan for 2018, Shanxi promised to close down 22.4 mt of annual coal capacity and 1.9 mt of steel capacity this year. It will also create \"no-coal zones\" and convert thousands of coal-fired boilers to cleaner-burning gas. Coal companies need to make a \"fundamental shift\" in how they control exposure to coal dust in underground mines to address the recent surge in black lung disease rates, according to the National Academies of Sciences, Engineering and Medicine report. The report found that even though coal operators largely comply with recently tightened rules requiring monitoring for coal dust, those measures may not be sufficient. The Government Accountability Office report said that the federal fund to help coal miners disabled by black lung disease will require a multibillion-dollar taxpayer bailout if Congress does not extend or increase the tax on coal production that funds it. The coal industry has been lobbying Congress to ensure that scheduled reduction in the tax it pays into that fund goes forward, arguing the payments have already been too high. The Mongolian government submitted plans to parliament to list a chunk of the state-owned company that holds the giant Tavan Tolgoi coal mine. The IPO comes as the country looks to kickstart the long-delayed development of one of the world's largest coking coal deposits, with international coal prices picking up after years in the doldrums. Mining Minister Sumiyabazar Dolgorsuren presented a bill to parliament proposing the sale of up to 30 percent of the project on domestic and international stock markets. The government said that it would also speed up plans to build a $1 billion coal-fired power plant near the mine, as well as a 247-kilometre railway that would help deliver Tavan Tolgoi's coal to the Chinese border. Tavan Tolgoi, in the Gobi desert about 250 kilometres from the Chinese border, has an estimated 7.4 billion tonnes of reserves and is considered one of Mongolia's flagship mining projects. It is run by state-owned Erdenes Tavan Tolgoi. However, it has been held back by poor infrastructure and weak coal prices as well as disputes over the role foreign investment should play in Mongolia's economic development. KOSPO bought 160,000 tonnes of coal for loading between September and October via a tender that closed, the utility said. KOSPO originally sought to buy a total of 480,000 tonnes of coal but declined to buy 320,000 tonnes due to high prices, the utility said. It had not yet decided whether to re-issue a tender for the cancelled amount. The utility purchased 160,000 tonnes of coal from Indonesia, the source said, without giving price and supplier information. The World Bank said it has not yet decided whether to support a planned 500 MW coal-fired power plant in Kosovo, the first major energy project in the Balkan country in more than two decades. Kosovo's government signed a deal with US based but London-listed power generator ContourGlobal to build the plant at a cost of around \u20ac1 billion ($1.2 billion). Kosovo is struggling with power shortages. Around 90 percent of its electricity is produced in two ailing coal-fired plants that are seen as among the worst polluters in Europe. Environmentalists have complained the plant could lock Kosovo into a future powered by lignite - the dirtiest form of coal.

India's import bill of crude oil and petroleum products swelled 57 percent to $12.73 billion in June as compared to the same month last year. The ballooning of oil import bill comes on the back of a 60 percent rise in Brent, the benchmark for half the world's crude, to $76 per barrel last month. Energy hungry India meets over 82 percent of its crude requirement through imports. The recent surge in international oil prices has resulted in worsening of Current Account Deficit (CAD) and fiscal deficit for the domestic economy apart from an inflated petroleum subsidy and high inflation. The increase in global crude oil prices led to CAD widening by $16.60 billion to a five-year high in June, wholesale inflation shooting up 5.77 percent, a four-and-a-half year high, and retail inflation growing to a five-month high of 5 percent. Total oil import bill in the first quarter of the current fiscal increased 49 percent to $34.64 billion, as compared to $23.18 billion in the corresponding quarter last fiscal. The country's CAD is likely to hover between $22 billion to $31 billion in the current financial year ending March 2019. According to Petroleum Planning and Analysis Cell (PPAC), the statistical arm of the oil ministry, India's crude oil import bill, excluding petroleum products, is expected to increase 24 percent to $109 billion in the current fiscal. Moody's Investor Services has said that the surge in international oil prices will result in the country's petroleum subsidy ballooning to Rs 53,000 crore, putting pressure on the country's fiscal deficit. The Union Budget 2018-19 had allocated Rs 24,933 crore as petroleum subsidy for the current financial year, a mere 2 percent increase over the Revised Estimate of Rs 24,460 crore allocated last financial year. Source: The Economic Times Goa top fuel guzzler, per capita petrol sales 6 times national average of 19 kg 17 July. Goa consumes more petrol and diesel on a per capita basis than any other state in the country, while Bihar uses the least. Per capita sales of petrol in Goa were 119.7 kilogram (kg) in 2017-18, over six times the national average of 19 kg, according to oil ministry data. In diesel, at 225.6 kg, Goans consumed almost three-and-half times the fuel than the national average of 66.9 kg. By contrast, in Bihar, per capita sales were 6.7 kg for petrol and 22 kg for diesel, about one-third the national average. Economic activity, tourist flow and inter-state variation in taxes largely contribute to the differences in per capita consumption of petrol and diesel among states, according to the Indian Oil Corp (IOC). Goa top fuel guzzler, per capita petrol sales 6 times national average of 19 kg Tourism as well as dependence on diesel for power drive up per capita consumption of petrol and diesel in some union territories as well. Puducherry, Andaman & Nicobar Islands, Dadra & Nagar Haveli and Daman & Diu have sharply higher consumption than the national average. A lower economic activity and higher population in Bihar keep it at the bottom of the fuel consumption chart. Some states with lower taxes on fuel benefit from higher fuel sales as vehicle owners from bordering states drive down to filling stations offering cheaper fuel. For instance, a resident of Noida, Uttar Pradesh, is more likely to tank up his car in Delhi as the fuel is relatively cheaper in the national capital. Similarly, a truck driver going to Mumbai from Delhi is more likely to stop at a filling station in Haryana where fuel is cheaper due to lower taxes. This is one key reason Haryana has the second highest per capita consumption of diesel at 203 kg. In overall volume, Maharashtra topped the chart with sales of 3226,000 metric tonnes of petrol and 8673,000 metric tonnes of diesel. Uttar Pradesh was the second-biggest consumer in both petrol and diesel. Source: The Economic Times Petrol, Diesel prices reduced for the first time in July 16 July. Oil Marketing Companies (OMCs) reduced the retail price of petrol and diesel across the nation for the first time, after increasing fuel prices nine times in July. Indian Oil Corp (IOC), the country's largest fuel retailer, reduced petrol prices in Delhi by 11 paise and diesel rates by 14 paise per litre, bringing down the prices of the two automobile fuels to Rs 76.84 and Rs 68.47 per litre, respectively. The price of petrol sold in other cities \u2014 Mumbai, Kolkata and Chennai \u2014 were also reduced to Rs 84.22, Rs 79.51 and Rs 79.76 per litre, respectively. Diesel prices in Mumbai, Chennai and Kolkata were reduced to Rs 72.65, Rs 72.28 and Rs 71.03 per liter, respectively. The retail prices of fuel in Delhi had hit an all-time high of Rs 78.43 per litre for petrol and Rs 69.31 per litre for diesel on 30 May but were reduced later. Source: The Economic Times Battle for ATF pipelines in Mumbai hots up: RIL vs PSUs 15 July. The battle over lucrative pipelines supplying jet fuel to Mumbai airport is hotting up with a powerful formation of Reliance Industries Ltd (RIL) and private airlines Jet Airways and Emirates trying to break the stranglehold of PSU (Public Sector Undertaking) oil firms BPCL (Bharat Petroleum Corp Ltd) and HPCL (Hindustan Petroleum Corp Ltd). BPCL and HPCL built and operate two separate pipelines from their Mahul refineries in Mumbai to supply jet fuel or aviation turbine fuel (ATF) to airlines at the Chhatrapati Shivaji International Airport at Santacruz in the city. RIL, which produces a fourth of India's ATF, wants access to these pipelines to be able to get a pie of Rs 10,000 crore fuel trade that happens at one of Asia's busiest airports. While RIL and airlines feel competition among fuel suppliers would bring down costs, HPCL and BPCL said the pipelines are their \"captive\" infrastructure to take products out of the refineries and giving third party access to them would hurt their operations and profits. The Petroleum and Natural Gas Regulatory Board (PNGRB) supported the RIL idea and sought industry comments on declaring pipelines as a common carrier and giving third parties access. If implemented, it would also an airline to import fuel and use the infrastructure at the refineries situated on the coast to transport it to the airport. A company like RIL can ship the fuel from its refineries at Jamnagar in Gujarat to Mumbai and use pipelines to take it into the airport. RIL said the present ATF demand at Chhatrapati Shivaji International Airport is 1.4 million tonnes per annum and it is \"absolutely essential\" that access to the BPCL and HPCL ATF pipelines is available to other jet fuel marketing oil companies to service this demand. RIL wanted PNGRB to declare the twin pipelines as a common carrier and give access to other entities on a non-discriminatory basis. Also, it wanted \"hook-up\" facility within BPCL and HPCL refinery complexes to be able to feed ATF into the pipelines. The Airports Authority of India said the move would ensure cheaper ATF is available to the benefit of passengers and result in optimal utilisation of existing pipeline infrastructure. Source: Business Standard Can petrol, diesel prices be made same for four wheelers: SC asks Centre 13 July. The Supreme Court (SC) directed the Centre to apprise it as to whether petrol and diesel can have an equal pricing for four wheelers and private cars after the Environment Pollution Control Authority (EPCA) said pollution from diesel vehicles was a cause of concern. A bench of justices Madan B Lokur and Deepak Gupta suggested that the government could contemplate fixing price of diesel and petrol on par for four wheelers, other than goods vehicles. Advocate Aparajita Singh, assisting the apex court as an amicus curiae in the matter, told the bench that the real concern was pollution from diesel vehicles. She said that people go for diesel vehicles since they have high power fuel efficiency. The amicus told the bench that one of the EPCA's report show there was \"leakage\" of funds from environment compensation charge (ECC) which was levied by the apex court for purchase of diesel vehicles. The court then and said that Germany was contemplating banning use of diesel vehicles. The amicus told the court that European countries were trying to fix NOx (nitrogen oxide) pollution standards since they were grappling with pollution and Germany was trying to do away with diesel vehicles. The bench said that government could consider fixing price of diesel and petrol on par for four wheelers. The counsel, appearing for vehicle manufacturers, told the apex court that BS-VI fuel, which is likely to be made available in National Capital Region (NCR) from April 2019, would solve the problem of pollution from diesel vehicles. The amicus said that Indian Oil Corp (IOC) was upbeat about Hydrogen fuel cell-powered vehicles and they have the requisite technology for it. The government had also said that reducing the price gap between petrol and diesel would not be \"economically viable\" and would lead to inflation. Source: Business Standard LPG subsidy jumps 60 percent as government maintains prices to help consumers 12 July. Cooking gas or liquefied petroleum gas (LPG) subsidy has jumped by over 60 percent in last two months as the government maintains price line despite rising international rates, Indian Oil Corp (IOC) Chairman Sanjiv Singh said. All LPG consumers have to buy fuel at market price. The government, however, subsidises 12 cylinders of 14.2 kilogram (kg) each per households in a year by providing the subsidy amount directly in bank accounts of users. The higher subsidy was meant to keep rates of subsidised LPG in check, Singh said. International rates of LPG, which was used as a benchmark for pricing of domestic fuel, have been on the run since June. Non-subsidised or market priced LPG price was Rs 653.50 per 14.2 kg bottle in the national capital in May, which rose to Rs 698.50 (Rs 48 pr cylinder) in June. This month price has further risen by Rs 55.50 to Rs 754 in Delhi. Non-subsidised LPG is the one that consumers buy after exhausting their quota of below market rate fuel. It is also bought by those who have voluntarily given up subsidy and by commercial establishments. As per tax rules, GST (Goods and Services Tax) on LPG has to be calculated at market rate of the fuel. The government may choose to subsidise a part of the price but tax will have to be paid at market rates. This has meant that GST is calculated every month on the rate at which domestic non-subidised LPG is priced. With rates on the rise, the tax has also risen, resulting in a minor increase in rates for subsidised users, Singh said. Subsidised LPG was priced at Rs 491.21 per cylinder in May, which rose to Rs 493.55 in June and Rs 496.26 this month, Singh said. As a result of higher global rates, the price of non-subsidised LPG in Delhi will increase by Rs 55.50 per cylinder. Oil firms revise LPG price on 1st of every month based on average benchmark rate and foreign exchange rate in the previous month. Source: Business Standard India's Iranian oil imports in June fall as sanctions fears bite 11 July. India's oil imports from Iran declined by 15.9 percent in June, the first month after the United States (US) said it would reimpose sanctions on the country, according to data from shipping and industry sources. In June, India imported 592,800 barrels per day (bpd) of oil from Iran compared to 705,200 bpd in May, the data showed. India, Iran's top oil client after China, has asked refiners to look for alternative oil supplies as the nation may have to drastically cut imports from Tehran to comply with the renewed US sanctions. Lower purchases by private refiners dragged down India's June imports from Iran although state refiners stepped up purchases. State refiners, accounting for about 60 percent of India's nearly 5 million bpd of refining capacity, lifted about 10 percent more Iranian volumes in June compared to May, at about 454,000 bpd, the data showed. In April to June 2018, the first quarter of this fiscal year, India's oil imports from Iran rose by about 24 percent to about 647,000 bpd from the previous quarter, the data showed. Imports by state refiners during the period more than doubled to about 413,400 bpd from 191,700 bpd, the data showed. Source: Reuters NATIONAL: GAS ONGC to be taken on board for rerouting gas pipelines passing from Surat airport 14 July. The state government and the Airports Authority of India (AAI) have jointly decided to take the Oil and Natural Gas Corp (ONGC) on board to work out a solution to reroute or cover its gas pipeline in a time bound manner. The buried sour gas pipeline of ONGC passing from Surat airport is proving a major deterrent in the proposed extension of runway from 2,905 metre to 3,810 metre. The decision in this regard was taken at a meeting held between AAI chairman Guruprasad Mohapatra and chief secretary of Gujarat JN Singh in Gandhinagar. It must be noted that ONGC had invited expression of interest (EoI) for safe operation of the buried pipelines six months ago, but things are moving at a snail's pace. There are two 36 inch and 42 inch diameter South Bassein Hazira Trunk (SBHT) pipelines passing through the airport. These pipelines were laid in the year 1985 and 1996 respectively to transport sour dry natural gas from Bassein Platform A (BPA) and Bassein Platform B (BPB) offshore process platforms to onshore gas processing plant located at Hazira in Surat. As on date, the volume of gas being transported is around 33-36 million metric standard cubic metre per day (mmscmd) and 2,500-3000 cubic metre per day of condensate at an operating pressure of 60-80 kilogram per square centimetre.

Leading oil marketing companies such as Petronet LNG Ltd, Indian Oil Corp (IOC), BPCL (Bharat Petroleum Corp Ltd) and the like have huddled together to put up close to twenty LNG (liquefied natural gas) stations on various national highways to provide for LNG fed truck transport movement following instruction from the government, Petronet LNG Ltd Director (Finance) V K Mishra said. That tenders would be issued for this purpose in next 15 days. Addressing a Conference on \"City Gas Distribution in India\" under aegis of PHD Chamber of Commerce and Industry, Mishra clarified that this association of oil marketing companies have fructified on a pilot project base to feed roughly 5,000 trucks with LNG on leading five national highways, beginning 2019. According to him, the necessary permission to put up such LNG distribution center on national highways has already been given since the government has asked the oil marketing companies to put up such stations to attack the twin issues of fuel cost savings as well sufficiently addressing the issue pertaining to increasing fuel pollution. In addition, the higher element of efficiency would also be brought in with large number of trucks running on national highways with LNG as it is deemed to be a cleaner fuel with virtually no element of pollution in it, pointed out Mishra. He also clarified that India is inspired for this initiative partly with China where close to three lakh of trucks are operation on their highways with LNG fuel and the team of oil sector experts is currently visiting China to study there this system. In order to broad base the exercise of running trucks on LNG fuel to begin with and subsequently passenger buses also on the same fuel on national highways, the oil companies have already asked the truck manufacturers such as TATAs and Mahendras to accordingly make such trucks as can be fuelled with cheaper and cleaner fuel such as LNG and the like.

India's trade ministry recommended imposing a 25 percent duty on imports of solar cells and modules from China for one year to try to counter what it sees as a threat to domestic solar equipment manufacturing. Falling prices of solar cells and modules, over 90 percent of which India imports from China, have triggered a decline in the cost of solar power generation and led Indians increasingly to adopt the technology. India plans to make renewable power account for 40 percent of its total installed capacity by 2030, from 20 percent currently. The proposed safeguard duty, which would apply for two years in total to imports from China and Malaysia, would be reduced in the second year to 20 percent for six months and then 15 percent for six months. The proposed duty is less than the 70 percent recommended by Indian authorities in January. The recommendation, contained in a report published by the ministry and to be submitted to the government for approval, is intended to address a serious threat to the domestic solar manufacturing industry from Chinese imports, the directorate general of trade remedies (DGTR) said in the report. Indian solar cell and module manufacturers said cheap Chinese imports were hurting the domestic industry, while Chinese manufacturers say imports are helping India accelerate its renewable energy adoption program.

Efforts from state governments such as those of Maharashtra and Uttar Pradesh (UP) to develop floating solar plants might hit the financial-viability hurdle. Companies like JSW Energy have been planning to get into this business, while the Tatas and NTPC Ltd have already done pilots. Limited domestic availability of floats, however, is a big challenge. The industry has to depend on European or Chinese suppliers, which is not cost effective. The differential between a ground-mounted and a floating solar project does not make it viable in terms of product pricing, JSW Energy said. The company has plans to set up a combined floating solar capacity of 250 MW across various locations. In June, the Maharashtra government said that it had set up a committee for the development of a floating solar plant. UP was another state where the process to call for bids to develop a similar solar capacity on the Rihand dam was underway. Floating solar plants are considered an alternate option to tackle land availability issues. The concept involves setting up solar panels on floats placed on dams, lakes and similar water bodies. However, the indigenous production of floats, which substitutes land in a floating solar power set-up, at present, is minimal. In addition to the cost of imported floats, the logistic costs involved in transporting them to India are seen as a bigger challenge. The group is currently consulting Maharashtra's state power generation company for setting up 250 MW of floating solar capacity. The country is yet to see bids submitted for a floating solar plant from potential power companies.

OPEC (Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries) President Suhail al-Mazrouei said that volatility in the crude market was undesirable and OPEC prefers a more stable price environment, speaking after crude had its biggest one-day drop in two years. OPEC and other large producers are working on a long-term plan to build spare capacity that would cushion the market from unexpected outages, he said. When Libya reopened key oil exporting ports, global oil prices fell sharply, with benchmark Brent futures plunging 6.92 percent, the steepest one-day drop in two years. Tripoli-based Libya National Oil Corp said four export terminals were being reopened after a standoff that had shut down most of the OPEC member's oil output. Source: Reuters Libya's NOC reopens El Feel oilfield 12 July. Libya's National Oil Corp (NOC) said that it was reopening the El Feel oilfield after resolving a dispute with guards over pay and benefits that shut it down in February. Production at El Feel was expected to reach 50,000 barrels per day (bpd) in two days, and 72,000 bpd three days later, NOC said. The restart is a boost for Libya's oil industry, coming one day after an unrelated stoppage at major eastern oil terminals was ended. That disruption, which began in mid-June, had more than halved Libya's national oil production from highs in February of 1.28 million bpd. Operations at fields linked to the eastern ports are gradually resuming, with production restarting at the 70,000 bpd Abu Attifel field. Both El Feel and Abu Attifel are operated by Mellitah Oil and Gas, a joint venture between NOC and Italy's Eni. Libya's oil production has been repeatedly disrupted by blockades and conflict over the past five years. Before a 2011 uprising threw the OPEC (Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries) member into turmoil, it was producing more than 1.6 million bpd.

Source: Reuters Utilities in Europe to use long-distance drones to inspect transmission lines 16 July. Flying robots that can travel dozens of kilometres without stopping could be the next big thing for power companies. Utilities in Europe are looking to long-distance drones to scour thousands of miles of grids for damage and leaks in an attempt to avoid network failures that cost them billions of dollars a year. However the technology faces major safety and regulatory hurdles that are clouding its future in the sector. Snam and EDF's network subsidiary RTE have tested prototypes of long-distance drones that fly at low altitudes over pipelines and power lines. Italy's Snam, Europe's biggest gas utility, said it is trialling one of these machines - known as BVLOS drones because they fly 'beyond the visual line of sight' of operators - in the Apennine hills around Genoa. It hopes to have it scouting a 20 kilometre (km) stretch of pipeline soon. France's RTE has also tested a long-distance drone, which flew about 50 km inspecting transmission lines and sent back data that allowed technicians to virtually model a section of the grid. The company said it would invest \u20ac4.8 million ($5.6 million) on drone technology over the next two years. At present, power companies largely use helicopters equipped with cameras to inspect their networks. They have also recently started occasionally using more basic drones that stay within sight of controllers and have a range of only about 500 metres. Power grid companies are expected to spend over $13 billion a year on drones and robotics by 2026 globally, from about $2 billion now, according to Navigant Research.

ACWA Power said its projects in South Africa would create thousands of jobs in the country. The complex will be built with a CSP central tower that captures sunlight. Using this design will help the plant generate competitively priced electricity compared to other forms of renewable energy that cannot serve evening peak demand unless they are linked to \"extremely expensive\" utility scale batteries, ACWA Power said. Source: Construction Week Online Myanmar urged to review hydropower dam projects seen damaging to rural communities 12 July. Myanmar's government must ensure the protection of ethnic communities amid hydropower projects that have \"weak social and environmental safeguards,\" activists said. The Myanmar government must undertake reforms in its hydropower sector to prevent dam projects from negatively impacting rural ethnic minority communities in southeastern Kayin state, where electrification rates are lowest in the nation, according to a report issued by two ethnic Karen NGOs. The findings of the report, based on information collected in districts in Kayin state, discussions with focus groups, individual interviews with villagers, and legal research, conclude that instead of benefiting local communities, hydropower development in ethnic minority areas has diminished the livelihoods of those who rely on their land to secure their food and income. Residents are usually forced from their land by companies involved in dam-building or by armed forces, are given little or no opportunity to give their input on the projects, and are later permitted limited access to natural, religious, or cultural sites where the dams are constructed, the report said. The report said that hydropower development in southeastern Myanmar often occurs without adequate consultation with ethnic communities or due process of law, and that villagers receive inadequate or no compensation for the land, homes, and possessions they are forced to give up. Myanmar plans to build 50 large hydropower projects, 42 of which will be located in ethnic minority areas of the country, the report says. And of the 26 largest already built, 12 are situated in such regions. Source: Eco-Business Ireland commits to divesting public funds from fossil fuel companies 12 July. Ireland committed to divesting public funds from fossil fuel companies after parliament passed a bill forcing the \u20ac8.9 billion ($10.4 billion) Ireland Strategic Investment Fund (ISIF) to withdraw money invested in oil, gas and coal. Members of Ireland's Dail (Parliament) passed the Fossil Fuel Divestment Bill, which requires the fund to divest direct investments in fossil fuel undertakings within five years and not to make future investments in the industry. The bill said indirect investments should not be made, unless there is unlikely to be more than 15 percent of an asset invested in a fossil fuel undertaking. As of June last year, the fund's investments in the global fossil fuel industry were estimated at \u20ac318 million across 150 companies. Ireland was ranked the second-worst performing European Union country, in front of Poland, in terms of climate change action in June by environmental campaign group Climate Action Network (CAN) Europe. The world's top oil, gas and coal companies face rising pressure from investors to shift to cleaner energy and renewables to meet international greenhouse gas emissions cut targets. Fossil fuel divestment has gained traction over the past few years as pension funds, sovereign wealth funds and universities, have sold oil, gas and coal stocks, especially after the 195-nation Paris climate agreement set a goal in 2015 of phasing out the use of fossil fuels this century. Norway's $1 trillion sovereign wealth fund, the world's largest, is barred from investing in firms that get more than 30 percent of their business from coal and it has also proposed to drop its investments in oil and gas. The government will give its opinion about that broader divestment in October. In the United States, New York City announced a goal earlier this year to divest its $189 billion public pension funds from fossil fuel companies in five years.

Renewable energy sources satisfied more of Germany's power demands than coal during the first half of 2018, marking a shift towards clean power as the Bundesrepublik continues to debate how best to phase out coal. According to data released by the German Association of Energy and Water Industries (BDEW) data, wind, solar, hydropower and biogas met 36.3% of Germany's electricity needs between January and June 2018, while coal provided just 35.1%. Although renewables have hit notable benchmarks in the past, outstripping fossil fuels on certain days or even weeks, this is the first time coal has fallen by the wayside during such a long period of time in Germany. In comparison to the same period in 2017, renewables only met 32.5% in the first six months of last year, with coal generating 38.5%. New Energy Minister Peter Altmaier refused to consider anything above a 32% renewable energy target for 2030, cutting down any hopes that national capitals could be convinced to back the European Parliament's proposed 35% mark.
