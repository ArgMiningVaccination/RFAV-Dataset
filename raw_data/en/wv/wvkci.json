However it manifests - from [anxiety](https://www.vogue.co.uk/beauty/article/how-to-deal-with-anxiety) and depression to more physical symptoms, such as panic attacks - stress impacts us all in different ways. One thing's for sure, though: we all feel it in some form or another. According to [statistics from CIPHR](https://www.ciphr.com/workplace-stress-statistics/), one in five people in the UK feel stressed more days a month than they don't, while those from [Statista](https://www.statista.com/statistics/1134359/common-types-of-stress-in-the-uk/) revealed that 79 per cent of us put this stress down to work. Since, for most of us, there's no escaping the workplace, it's all about finding balance and ways to calm the mind, soothe our senses and generally work on feeling at peace. Yes, getting outdoors and doing some exercise can help, but increasingly many of us are turning to an assembly of talented modern day healers, who work holistically to restore body and mind to its former glory. Naysayers will ask where the proof is, but the clich\u00e9 truth is that it's in the pudding. Below, some of Vogue's favourite practitioners to see now. [\"I Feel Like I Am In Flow\": Kate Moss On The Spiritual Journey That Inspired Her New Wellness Brand](/beauty/article/kate-moss-cosmoss) The fashion world has long belonged to Kate Moss. Next, the supermodel is setting her sights on wellness, by launching a stellar new brand - as she tells Rose Ferguson. Ross Barr Beloved by royalty, all manner of famous faces and the Vogue beauty team, five element acupuncturist [Ross Barr](http://rossbarr.com/) is the man to book in with now. Five element acupuncture works on the ancient Chinese theory that mind, body and spirit are made up of the five elements, including wood, fire, earth, metal and water, and should be in balance for us to be well - and it works. Barr's ability to transform how you feel is one thing, but he is also an excellent practitioner to see if you're suffering from physical and mental problems, whether that's back pain, digestive problems and hair loss or depression and stress - not to mention he is also well known for his expertise in treating fertility issues. Aside from the fact that you walk in one person, and leave quite another, he is also a great listener with excellent energy himself. Book in now. Emma Lucy Knowles Whether you're in need of some guidance or simply at a crossroads in your life, a session with [Emma Lucy Knowles](https://www.emmalucyknowles.com/) will leave you feeling optimistic and ready for whatever comes next. She is a healer, clairvoyant, energy worker and spiritual coach, who also works with crystals, and the beauty of her sessions is that she tailors them to you and your needs. As warm and welcoming as they come, she offers IRL and virtual appointments, and will look after you wherever you find yourself. Trust the hype! Medium Fleur If I asked you to envision a spiritual guide or medium, chances are you'd come up with someone resembling Mystic Meg - certainly not [Medium Fleur](https://www.mediumfleur.com/), a glamorous-meets-boho psychic medium, who has been working in the space since 2008. Seeing herself as a translator who facilitates a connection between her client and the spirit of their loved one (or to their own spirit), a session with her can help you heal, grow and gain closure, as well as process grief - it is meaningful to say the least. \"When we can move past the 'is it real?' question, we enter the much more interesting space of 'what can it do?',\" she says. \"I have personally witnessed the work of a psychic medium being a catalyst for processing grief and depression, as well as for soul-searching.\" Based in Los Angeles, book in with her for a session over video link - you won't regret it. Ada Ooi With many a string to her bow, [Ada Ooi](https://www.adaooi.com/) is a Traditional Chinese Medicine practitioner whose treatments work to balance body and mind from the inside, out. From gua sha and cupping to acupuncture, acupressure, fascia tension release and all manner of skincare techniques, Ooi works to regulate your qi (or energy life flow) by way of the body's meridian networks, and subsequently releases stagnated energy, toxins and emotions. As much a wizard for body and mind as she is for skin, there's a reason she has a big celebrity fan base. Renata Nunes Walk into [Renata Nunes](https://www.rkntherapist.com/)'s therapy room in London's 180 The Strand, and you'll quickly feel a sense of peace. With a deep understanding of the body - internally and externally - she combines her practice in Traditional Chinese Medicine with a background in physiotherapy to address the body's maladies on every level. After a tongue and pulse assessment and a number of different questions about day-to-day bodily functions, she treats you accordingly, but you can expect acupuncture, deeply relaxing massage and neck and scalp mobilisation. An excellent reset. Sarah Bradden From reflexology to cosmetic acupuncture, consider [Sarah Bradden](https://www.sarahbradden.com/) your body (and skin's) new best friend. A big hit with fashion and beauty's big hitters, the caring Bradden tends to your needs with her multi-faceted approach that comprises activated oxygen, LED light therapy, reiki energy healing and massage, as well as the aforementioned reflexology and acupuncture. Situated in Hershesons salon in London's Belgravia, a treatment with her will totally transform how you see the world. Paolo Lai A specialist in reflexology, [Paolo Lai's](https://www.paoloreflex.com/) treatments are as relaxing as they are effective. As well as traditional foot reflexology, in which points on the feet are pressed or massaged to connect to (and treat) certain organs and systems within the body, Lai also offers facial reflexology and sculpting massage. The result? Relaxation, a sense of calm and healing on all levels. "}
