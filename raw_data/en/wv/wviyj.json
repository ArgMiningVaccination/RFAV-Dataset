Working in partnership with our global customer-base, we deliver advanced ingredient solutions that enable innovation, excite today's consumers, and contribute to public health. Rousselot is a brand of Darling Ingredients *Global Gelatin Market Insights Forecast to 2026, Calibre Research, 2020 As the global leader, Rousselot, offers an extensive range of world-class products and solutions ranging from functional gelatins for the pharmaceutical industries to health or biomedical high end solutions, all based on collagen: Through our state-of-the-art operations, extensive technical expertise and sustained scientific research, we help our customers achieve their goals, create world-class products, and we \"Reach further together\". The effectiveness of nutra-, pharmaceutical and medical supplements is closely related to the form in which these supplements are delivered. Gelatin has proven its worth as a natural, safe and highly versatile excipient for most delivery forms in use today. With Rousselot gelatin you can count on best-in-class dosage forms, either hard capsules, soft gels or functional gummies. Because of its unique functional capabilities and excellent dissolution properties, gelatin is by far the main ingredient in soft gelatin capsules. But when working with specific fills, manufacturers may experience cross-linking issues that unfavorably affect soft gel stability. StabiCaps is a range of gelatins tailored to prevent crosslinking in soft gels and thus to increase their stability. It is the perfect solution for the most reactive fills. \u00a9iStock SiMoGel is a new gelatin-based solution for the production of gummies without starch depositing. SiMoGel enables manufacturers to produce gummies in a perfectly clean, hygienic (starch-free) environment. It significantly optimises the production process and lowers the costs. It paves the way for innovative gummies with 3D shapes, stripes and fillings. In 2020, Rousselot invented the \"gummy caps\", a new delivery form based on SiMoGel: Gummy caps combine the benefits of capsules, soft gels, and gummies in a single delivery format. Gummy caps can be used to deliver a broad range of active ingredients at highly accurate dosages.
