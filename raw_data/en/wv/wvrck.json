Early Pain Theories and Remedies Since ancient times, humans have sought to conquer pain using a variety of treatments ranging from the sublime to the bizarre. Although the Greeks and Romans first advanced a theory of sensation\u2014the idea that the brain and nervous system have a role in producing the perception of pain\u2014it was not until the Middle Ages and well into the Renaissance that evidence began to accumulate in support of these theories. In 1664 the French philosopher Ren\u00e9 Descartes described what, to this day, is still called a pain pathway . Descartes illustrated how particles of fire in contact with the foot travel to the brain and compared pain sensation to the ringing of a bell. In the nineteenth century the application of new chemical and scientific techniques led to the development of morphine, codeine, and heroin\u2014potent pain medications derived from opium. In the early 1800s morphine was marketed as a pain medication as well as treatment for opium and alcohol addiction. During this era, another potent pain medication and appetite suppressant\u2014cocaine\u2014was successfully isolated from coca leaves by a German chemist. In the late 1800s and early 1900s, heroin was marketedby Bayer Pharmaceutical Products as a non-addictive morphine substitute and cough suppressant.

Laudanum, a popular tincture containing opium and alcohol and other ingredients such as honey, saffron, or cinnamon, was widely used\u2014and completely legal\u2014until the late 1800s. It was commonly used for pain, menstrual cramps, sleep aid, and a wide variety of other ailments both in children and adults.

Source Wikimedia Commons.Although coca lea ves, opium, and other narcotics had been used for millennia to treat pain, the isolation of the narcotic compounds within these drugs and their subsequent a vailabilit y in tablet and powder forms led to their widespread adoption as pain medications, as well as to their widespread abuse. At the turn of the nineteenth century , \"pure\" aspirin w as isolated from salicylate-rich plants. This disco very represented a major breakthrough in the history of pain medications. T o this da y aspirin is the most commonly used pain reliev er worldwide. During the twentieth century man y opioid and non-opioid medications continued to be dev eloped. In the 1950s, a drug called P ercodan w as appro ved by the F ood and Drug Administr ation. A combination of o xycodone and aspirin, the relativ e ease with which this powerful opioid medication could be obtained, along with the contention that a narcotic prescribed b y a ph ysician could not lead to addiction, exacerbated an ongoing opioid abuse problem that has ebbed and flowed for millennia. The Exp erience o f Pain In our astoundingly complex healthcare system, pro viders are expected to be knowledgeable about pain management across an entire spectrum of diseases and injuries \u2014from tempor ary discomfort to chronic problems. They are also expected to understand the complex psy chological issues related to pain, and to be knowledgeable about div ersion of prescription pain medications and drug-seeking beha viors. Many factors contribute to this difficult picture. The gener al public ma y be surprised to learn that pain education and tr aining is far from comprehensiv e and man y clinicians ma y lack a thorough understanding of the causes and mechanisms of pain. Misinformation about addiction, unnecessarily restrictiv e drug control regulations and pr actices, fear of legal sanctions for legitimate medical pr actice, and the inflated cost of pain treatment complicate this picture. These barriers can be understood not only as a failure to pro vide essential medicines to reliev e suffering but also as human rights abuses (Lohman et al. , 2010).The Institute of Medicine (IOM) estimates that treatment and management of pain costs about $635 billion annually in the United States in direct medical costs and lost productivit y (IOM, 2011). Despite these costs\u2014 approaching two-thirds of a trillion dollars a year\u2014our failure to enact policies on pain treatment, management, and palliativ e care, along with the failure to put in place functioning drug supply systems, has hampered the development of consistent pain policies throughout the United States. Pain Often Undertreated Despite the amount of money spent each y ear on the treatment and management of pain, it is nev ertheless inadequately treated in vulner able populations such as children, older adults, and ethnic minorities. P atients with cognitiv e impairments, cancer patients, and those with activ e addiction or a history of substance abuse are also undertreated. Untreated pain has a profound impact on qualit y of life and can ha ve physical, psychological, social, and economic consequences. Inappropriately managed acute pain can result in immunologic and neur al changes, which can progress to chronic pain if untreated. Clinical outcomes of untreated postoper ative pain include increased risk of atelectasis, respir atory m yocardial ischemia, infarct or cardiac failure, and thromboembolic disease. Common sequelae of untreated chronic pain include decreased mobilit y, impaired immunit y, decreased concentr ation, anorexia, and sleep disturbances (King & Fr aser, 2013). Surprisingly , undertreatment of pain can be an issue for those with diseases and conditions known to cause pain, such as cancer , HIV, and tr auma. Conserv ative estimates b y the World Health Organization (WHO) suggest that 1 million terminal HIV/AIDS patients, 5.5 million cancer patients, and 800,000 tr auma patients ha ve little or no access to treatment for moder ate to sev ere pain (King & Fr aser, 2013). Older adults and those of r acial and ethnic minorities are at higher risk of being undertreated for pain. Studies ha ve shown that minorit y patients with pain are more lik ely to report greater activit y limitations, sev ere pain, and functional impairments compared with non-Hispanic whites. The sources of pain disparities among r acial and ethnic minorities are complex and are related to lack of pro vider education, system-lev el lack of access to pain medications, and cultur al beliefs about pain (Makris et al. , 2015). In the African American population, lower r ates of clinician assessment and higher r ates of undertreatment ha ve been found in all settings and across all t ypes of pain (IOM, 2011). Similar results ha ve been found among Hispanics, Asian Americans, and Nativ e Americans.Gender pla ys a significant role in pain management. A large number of studies indicate that there is gender bias (an unintended and systematic neglect of one gender) in healthcare. W omen are more often neglected than men and medically unjustified differences in the a vailabilit y of examination and treatment of women ha ve been demonstr ated with a number of conditions, including coronary heart disease, neck pain, irritable bowel syndrome, tuberculosis, renal tr ansplantation, and HIV treatment (Hammarstr\u00f6m et al. , 2015). In one study , HIV-infected women with pain were twice as likely to be undertreated as their male counterparts (Lohman et al. , 2010). A Swedish study aimed to understand whether gender pla ys a role in a patient 's access to pain rehabilitation services. R esearchers found that men more often than women were referred to ph ysiother apy and x -ray independent of self -reported pain intensit y, pain activit y, and pain localization. Higher scores on self -reported pain did not trigger referr al to rehabilitation. In fact, a negativ e trend w as found among women. The higher the scores of pain, the less lik ely that women were referred to rehabilitation (Hammarstr\u00f6m et al. , 2015). Not surprisingly , nursing home residents report inadequate pain control. It is estimated that 45% to 80% of patients in nursing homes ha ve substantial pain that is undertreated. This suggests that when nursing home residents ha ve moder ate to sev ere pain, they ha ve only about a 50% chance of obtaining adequate pain relief . People ma y be discour aged from seeking treatment because they lack health insur ance or lack a \"usual\" source of care. Some ma y not seek out treatment due to distrust of clinicians, low expectations of treatment outcomes, language barriers, and communication difficulties (IOM, 2011). Global Health and Pain By an y measure, pain is an enormous problem throughout the world. Globally , it has been estimated that 1 in 5 adults suffer from pain and that another 1 in 10 adults are diagnosed with chronic pain each y ear. The fiv e greatest causes of pain are Cancer1. Osteoarthritis2. Rheumatoid arthritis3. Surgeries and McGee, 2011)5.Clearly , the etiology of pain is a complex, multidisciplinary issue with multiple serious consequences, including depression, inabilit y to work, disrupted social relationships, and suicidal thoughts (Goldberg & McGee, 2011). In dev eloping countries, tr affic collisions, lung cancer , and HIV/AIDS are among the leading causes of mortalit y. Each is lik ely to cause pain that is sev ere, debilitating, and untreated. Conserv ative estimates b y WHO suggest that 800,000 tr auma patients, 5.5 million cancer patients, and 1 million terminal HIV/AIDS patients ha ve little or no access to treatment for moder ate to sev ere pain (King & Fr aser, 2013). Worldwide, medications for the treatment of pain are distributed unev enly. Appro ximately 89% of the total world consumption of morphine occurs in North America and Europe. Low - and middle-income countries consume only 6% of the morphine used worldwide, ev en though they are home to about half of all cancer patients and more than 90% of HIV - infected patients. Despite the a vailabilit y of medications, howev er, inadequate pain management is still prev alent in dev eloped countries (Lohman et al. , 2010). Regulatory Issues r e Pain Management Patients, pro viders, communities, and health systems ha ve struggled to achiev e balance between access to opioid treatment for chronic pain and potential harmful consequences of long-term opioid ther apy\u2014especially misuse, addiction, and o verdose. R egulatory agencies and expert groups ha ve published prescriber guidelines aimed at impro ving evidence-based practices, including: These pr actices are becoming the standard of care for individuals on long-term opioid therapy (Beck er et al. , 2016). In 2016 the U .S. Centers for Disease Control and Prev ention (CDC) issued Guideline for Prescribing Opioids for Chronic Pain . The guideline calls for a dr astic reduction in the use of opioids for the treatment of chronic, noncancer pain. Dosage recommendations for exercising caution are lower than older opioid prescribing guidelines and recogniz e that even doses (20-50 morphine milligr am equiv alents per da y) increase risk (CDC, 2016a).Use of opioid treatment agreements1. Regular monitoring for efficacy , safet y, and misuse using tools such urine drug testing and querying prescription monitoring databases2. Provision of , or referr al to, addiction treatment if recurrent misuse or opioid use disorder is identified.3.Additionally , the CDC Guideline cautions that opioids pose risk to all patients, and currently available tools cannot rule out risk for abuse or other serious harm. It pro vides recommendations on pro viding safer care for all patients. The Guideline also encour ages use of recent technological adv ances, such as state prescription drug monitoring progr ams. The Guideline pro vides more specific recommendations than previous guidelines on monitoring and discontinuing opioids when risks and harms outweigh benefits (CDC, 2016a). The Joint Commission In recent y ears, the Joint Commission' s requirement for assessment and reassessment of pain has tr ansformed how healthcare pro viders approach pain management. The Joint Commission, in collabor ation with the Univ ersity of Wisconsin, Madison, has dev eloped pain management standards for accredited ambulatory care facilities, beha vioral healthcare organizations, critical access hospitals, home care pro viders, hospitals, office-based surgery pr actices, and long-term care pro viders. The standards require organizations to: Recogniz e the right of patients to appropriate assessment and management of pain. Screen patients for pain during their initial assessment and, when clinically required, during ongoing periodic re- assessments. Educate patients suffering from pain and their families about pain management as a part of care. (The Joint Commission, 2013) The Joint Commission' s pain guidelines further state that: Clinicians must be competent in the assessment and management of pain. Pain should not interfere with optimal lev el of function or rehabilitation. Pain and symptom management must be included in discharge planning. (The Joint Commission, 2013) Choice of a pain assessment tool is left to the discretion of an individual healthcare facilit y, but the Joint Commission encour ages a simple 0 to 10 pain scale. Healthcare pro viders are required to address the needs of non-communicativ e patients\u2014including those with dementia\u2014b y using an alternativ e means of assessment.Despite widespread belief to the contr ary, the Joint Commission does not require healthcare organizations to assess pain as a fifth vital sign (The Joint Commission, 2016), although the Commission does require that patients be screened for pain during the initial assessment. Some large organizations, including the V eteran's Administr ation (V A), in an effort to mak e pain a more visible part of patient assessment, decided to describe pain as the \"fifth vital sign\" , to be assessed along with temper ature, pulse, respir ation, and blood pressure. Acknowledging that assessing pain as a fifth vital sign ma y have contributed to the overprescribing of opioids, in June 2016 the American Medical Association recommended that pain be remo ved as one of the vital signs for which patients are assessed. Controlled Substances Act The Controlled Substances Act (CS A) established in 1970 is a system that regulates the manufacture and distribution of certain substances with a potential for abuse. The CS A groups or classifies drugs into fiv e \"schedules, \" based on whether they ha ve a currently accepted medical use in treatment in the United States, their relativ e abuse potential, and the lik elihood of causing dependence when abused (DEA, 2016). The Five Schedules of the Controlled Substances Act Substances in Schedule I have (1) no currently accepted medical use in the United States, (2) a lack of accepted safet y for use under medical supervision, and (3) a high potential for abuse. Examples include heroin, marijuana, LSD , peyote, and ecstasy (DEA, 2016). Substances in Schedule II have a high potential for abuse, which ma y lead to severe psy chological or ph ysical dependence. Examples include Dilaudid, methadone, Demerol, o xycodone, and fentan yl (DEA, 2016). Substances in Schedule III have a potential for abuse less than substances in Schedules I or II. Abuse ma y lead to moder ate or low ph ysical dependence or high psychological dependence. Examples include T ylenol with codeine, Subo xone, substances containing not more than 90 mg of codeine per dosage, k etamine, and anabolic steroids (DEA, 2016). Substances in Schedule IV have a low potential for abuse relativ e to substances in Schedule III. They consist primarily of prepar ations containing limited quantities of certain narcotics such as X anax, Soma, Klonopin, T ranxene, V alium, A tivan, Versed, Restoril, and Halcion (DEA, 2016). Substances in Schedule V include cough prepar ations containing not more than 200 milligr ams of codeine per 100 milliliters or per 100 gr ams (R obitussin AC, Phenergan with Codeine), and ez ogabine (DEA, 2016). The CS A also establishes a national drug control system to distribute appro ved medications to patients. The drug control system is a closed system\u2014that is, all enterprises and individuals in volved in production, distribution, prescribing, dispensing, possession, research, and disposal of prescription-only controlled substances must be registered with the Drug Enforcement Administr ation (DEA) and also the state, if required. Conditions of DEA registr ation include: Adhering to la ws and regulations that limit medication a vailabilit y to legitimate medical uses and patients Implementing safeguards against div ersion Reporting to the DEA amounts distributed to all registr ants at the retail lev el, as well as amounts that are lost or stolen (PPSG, 2014a) Federal controlled substances la ws do not supersede FDA -appro ved uses of medications, and states ha ve the jurisdiction to regulate healthcare professionals and their pr actice (PPSG, 2014a).Physicians can lose their DEA registr ation and be subject to criminal or civil penalties if they issue prescriptions for non-medical purposes or outside the usual course of medical practice. Man y states ha ve policies that acknowledge a pr actitioner 's need to understand and comply with relev ant feder al and state la ws when prescribing controlled substances (PPSG, 2014a). Intractable Pain Treatment Acts Intractable pain is commonly defined as \"a pain state. . . which in the gener ally accepted course of medical pr actice no relief or cure of the cause of the pain is possible. . . \" (PPSG, 2014b). Intractable P ain Treatment Acts (IPT A) are statutes originally intended to impro ve access to pain management b y providing ph ysicians immunit y from regulatory sanctions for prescribing opioids to patients with intr actable pain. The first IPT A was adopted b y Texas in 1989 (PPSG, 2014b). IPTAs are a product of the time in which they were first created, t ypically the late 1980s and 1990s. A t that time, man y physicians felt that their regulatory authorities viewed opioid use for chronic pain as being outside legitimate medical pr actice, and they work ed with legislators to dev elop IPT As to protect their pr actice from disciplinary action b y placing it squarely within legitimate medical pr actice (PPSG, 2014b). A potential consequence of such a policy is that prescribing controlled substances, if viewed as outside the IPT A, could be considered a violation of feder al and state controlled substances la w or regulatory policy . In addition, IPT As were probably not intended to formaliz e the use of opioids for pain as being within medical pr actice only when meeting the IPT A standards. The IPT A language w as often ambiguous and w as not consistent with the recognition that pain management, including the use of opioid medications, is part of gener al medicine and is a legitimate professional pr actice (PPSG, 2014b). A number of states ha ve recogniz ed these contr adictions and ha ve work ed to remo ve confusing language from their IPT As. For example, in 2001 Michigan became the first state to delete the term intractable pain from its statute, thus making its pro visions applicable to pain in gener al. More recently , both California (the state with the second-oldest IPT A) and Rhode Island repealed a number of restrictiv e provisions from their IPT As, including removing the term and definition of intractable pain (PPSG, 2014b).In states where IPT As still exist, state policies can require (without ex ception) the physician to obtain a consultation from a specialist for ev ery patient with intr actable pain as a means to qualif y for immunit y from discipline before prescribing opioids to that patient, regardless of the clinical situation or pr actitioner qualifications. Such a requirement may be inappropriate if the pr actitioner is knowledgeable or has relev ant expertise, and appears to regulate pain management ex cessiv ely as well as the entire class of patients who ha ve \"intr actable\" pain (PPSG, 2014b). Although IPT As are intended to impro ve access to pain relief , such policies ma y instead discour age pain management or limit patient access because of the increased time and administr ative burden for the ph ysician, a lack of a vailable consultation resources, as well as the possibilit y of increased cost for the patient. Also , when a state policy requires a consultation, the liabilit y is unclear for a ph ysician who prescribes an opioid in the course of treating a patient with pain and who does not obtain the consultation (PPSG, 2014b). The Central Principle of Balance The Central Principle of Balance represents a go vernment 's dual obligation to establish a system of drug controls that prev ent abuse, tr afficking, and div ersion of narcotic drugs while ensuring the adequate medical a vailabilit y of needed medications. Opioids, including those in the ther apeutic group of morphine, should be accessible to patients who need opioids for the relief of pain (PPSG, 2014b). The Centr al Principle of Balance encour ages go vernments to ensure the adequate availabilit y of opioids for medical and scientific purposes. This includes empowering medical professionals to pro vide opioids in the course of professional pr actice, allowing them to prescribe, dispense, and administer according to the individual medical needs of the patient, and ensuring that a sufficient supply of opioids is a vailable to meet medical demand (PPSG, 2014b). The ev aluation of state pain policies b y the Univ ersity of Wisconsin P ain and P olicies Study Group has shown continual impro vement in state policies. A state' s grade represents the qualit y of its policies affecting pain treatment, based on the Centr al Principle of Balance, and is calculated from the total number of pro visions in a state fulfilling the ev aluation criteria; higher gr ades mean more balanced state policies influencing pain management, including the medical use of opioid analgesics. In 2013, Alabama, Georgia, Idaho , Iowa, Kansas, Maine, Massachusetts, Michigan, Montana, Oregon, Rhode Island, V ermont, Virginia, W ashington, and Wisconsin receiv ed an \" A\" rating, meaning these states ha ve the most balanced pain policies in the country . The 15 states achieving an A comprise 22% of the total U .S. population (PPSG, 2014a).The Physiology of Pain Pain pla ys an important in the surviv al of all animals. It acts as a signal, alerting us to potential tissue damage, and leads to a wide r ange of actions to prev ent or limit further damage. Physiologically , pain occurs when sensory nerv e endings called nociceptors (also referred to as pain receptors) come into contact with a painful or no xious stimulus. The resulting nerve impulse tr avels from the sensory nerv e ending to the spinal cord, where the impulse is rapidly shunted to the br ain via nerv e tracts in the spinal cord and br ainstem. The br ain processes the pain sensation and quickly responds with a motor response in an attempt to cease the action causing the pain. Nociceptive Pathways The classic nociceptiv e path way involves three t ypes of neurons: Primary sensory neurons in the peripher al nerv ous system, which conduct painful sensations from the periphery to the dorsal root of the spinal cord Secondary sensory neurons in the spinal cord or br ainstem, which tr ansmit the painful sensation to the thalamus Tertiary sensory neurons , which tr ansmit the painful sensation from the thalamus to the somatosensory areas of the cerebr al cortex. Sensory Nerves Entering the Spinal Cord A section of a lumbar vertebra showing the sensory nerves (in yellow, with bulge) entering the dorsal part of the spinal cord.

There are two major classes of nerv e fibers associated with the tr ansmission of pain: Unmyelinated C fibers 1.Destinations of the Spino thalamic and Spinoreticular Tracts in the Brain The thalamus is the destination of spinothalamic tract\u2014the sensory pathway responsible for processing pain, temperature, and crude touch. The brainstem reticular formation, which forms a diffuse, central core within the brainstem is the destination of the spinoreticular tract. Source: 3DScience.com. Used by permission.The C fibers are small and conduct impulses slowly . They respond to thermal, mechanical, and chemical stimuli and produce the sensation of dull, diffuse, aching, burning, and delayed pain. A -delta fibers, which are m yelinated and thus conduct impulses r apidly , respond to mechanical (pressure) stimulus and produce the sensation of sharp , localiz ed, fast pain. One of the most important centr al pain path ways is the spinothalamic tract , which originates in the spinal cord and extends to the thalamus. This spinal tr act tr ansmits sensory information related to pain, temper ature, and crude touch. Another prominent path way is the spino reticular tract , which is in volved in noci ceptiv e processing. The spino - reticular tr act is similar to the spino thalamic tr act in that it is excited b y similar sensory fibers. R ather than ascending to the thalamus howev er, spino reticular neurons terminate within the br ainstem. Mechanisms of Pain Pain can be caused b y a mechanical, chemical or inflammatory , or thermal mechanism. Pain of mechanical origin can be caused b y acute tr auma, injury , or o veruse. It ma y be constant, v ariable, or intermittent in nature and is affected b y movement and position. Pain of chemical or inflammatory origin is associated with arthritis and other inflammatory disorders. It is often constant but responds to positioning, ther apy, rest, and gentle movement. Medications are usually a part of the management regimen for chemical or inflammatory pain. Pain of thermal origin is the result of ex cessiv e heat or cold. If an acute pain sensation is intense enough, it can cause system- wide responses: increased alertness; focused attention; the suppression of feeding, sleep , and reproduction; and increased v ascular tone, respir ation, and blood sugar lev els. If pain persists or becomes chronic it can ev en change the circuitry in the centr al nerv ous system. Using Neuroimaging to Understand PainMyelinated A -delta fibers 2.Our understanding of how the br ain changes in response to chronic pain or to pharmacologic or other ther apeutic interv entions has been significantly impro ved as a result of neuroimaging techniques. Until the adv ent of these techniques, the living br ain was largely in visible to clinicians and researchers. The dev elopment of computed tomogr aphy (CT) and, soon thereafter , magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), allowed researchers to look into the living br ain and gain some understanding of the parts of the brain affected b y certain t ypes of pain. The dev elopment of positron emission tomogr aphy (PET) has allowed researchers, for the first time, to in vestigate neuronal activit y throughout the entire br ain (Casey , 2015). Functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI), ve been used to study the neur al bases of pain. Other magnetic resonance-based measures such as diffusion tensor imaging, spectroscop y, and v olumetric imaging are being used to assess pain-related changes in the br ain's wiring, chemistry , and structure; this will help gain further insights into the neurobiology of pain, particularly chronic pain (Lee & T racey, 2013). As a result, we now know that pain sensation is more complex than previously thought and involves div erse regions of the br ain. Imaging techniques ha ve allowed us to understand that pain results from activ ation of a number of br ain regions such as the am ygdala, insula, or the anterior cingulate cortex. W e are learning that pain is a result of complex interactions between the immune, nerv ous (both CNS and autonomic nerv ous system), and endocrine systems (Z ouikr et al. , 2016). In a study of patients with chronic low back pain, neuroimaging showed significant differences in br ain function. Compared to health y controls, chronic low back pain patients showed activ ation in pain-related br ain regions during administr ation of experimental pain, differences in activ ation during emotional decision-making tasks, and changes in specific brain regions during a simple visual attention task (K ong et al. , 2013). Other imaging studies ha ve reported structur al changes in the br ains of patients with chronic low back pain. One study found that these patients showed 5% to 11% less neocortical gr ay matter v olume than control subjects and that the decreased v olume w as related to pain dur ation. These studies indicate that chronic low back pain is also associated with structur al pathologic changes in the br ain (K ong et al. , 2013).Neuroimaging studies are also being used to predict which patients might tr ansition from acute to chronic pain. Using MRI scans in people with acute low back pain, researchers at North western Univ ersity Feinberg School of Medicine found abnormalities in the white matter in areas of the br ain associated with the processing of pain and emotion. After one year, study participants were scanned again, and those with persistent pain showed the same abnormalities identified at the onset of the injury . In patients with ongoing low back pain, these abnormalities ma y be an indication of which patients will go on to dev elop chronic low back pain (P aul, 2013). In patients with chronic pain, a number of research groups ha ve reported significant changes in pain processing at a functional lev el including allodynia* (a stimulus not normally painful is perceiv ed as painful), functional plasticit y, and alter ations in basic processes in the br ain and br ainstem. Alter ations in neurotr ansmitters ha ve also been reported in chronic pain patients using magnetic resonance spectroscop y. Such approaches have been applied to migr aine, back pain, and spinal cord injury . The approach can be used to define neuronal and ax onal mark ers, including specific and GABA (Borsook et al. , 2007). *Allodynia is a clinical feature of neuropathies, complex regional pain syndrome, post-herpetic neuralgia, migraine, and fibromyalgia. At a macroscopic lev el, a number of studies ha ve shown changes in v olume in br ain regions in patients with chronic neuropathic pain, complex regional pain syndrome, and fibrom yalgia. This insight has been seminal in tr ansforming our approach and thinking on chronic pain, since these changes indicate the potential of chronic pain being a neurodegener ative disease. A t a microscopic lev el, changes in dendritic spine densit y or alterations in neuronal count ha ve been observ ed in pain and stress. Such changes also have implications for the dev elopment of co-morbid disease such as depression (Borsook et al., 2007). Sensitization We can become sensitiz ed to pain. Sensitization is a neuroph ysiologic term that describes the increased responsiv eness of nociceptiv e neurons (the pain path ways become more sensitiv e). This can include a drop in the threshold for activ ating nociceptors and an increase in the frequency of firing for all stimuli (IA SP, 2012). Hyperalgesia (exagger ated responses to stimuli) and allodynia (see abo ve) are clinical mark ers used to detect the presence of sensitization (Z ouikr et al. , 2016). In sensitization, stimuli that would not normally cause pain, such as the light touch of a sheet on the skin, can cause intense pain. Sensitization can also cause tenderness and soreness, particularly when deep tissue such as joints and hollow viscer a are affected.There are two t ypes of sensitization: peripher al and centr al. Peripheral sensitization occurs in response to the release of inflammatory molecules such as histamine, prostaglandins, and pro-inflammatory cytokines. These substances sensitiz e (increase the excitabilit y of) nociceptors b y creating an \"inflammatory soup\" en vironment that enhances pain sensitivit y by reducing the threshold of nociceptors activ ation (Z ouikr et al. , 2016). Under normal circumstances, peripher al hypersensitivit y returns to normal when inflammation subsides or the source of the injury is remo ved (K yranou & Puntillo , 2012). , nociceptiv e-specific neurons ma y progressiv ely increase their response to repeated non-painful stimuli, dev elop spontaneous activit y, and increase the area of the body that is in volved with the pain. The h yperalgesia of centr al sensitization usually dev elops as part of ongoing pathology (ie, damage to peripher al or centr al nerv e fibers, cancer , rheumatoid arthritis) and considered maladaptiv e (Kyranou & Puntillo , 2012). Physiologic Effects of Unrelieved Pain Unreliev ed pain is a stressor that can lead to ph ysiologic changes and negativ e effects on the endocrine, cardio vascular , gastrointestinal, and immune systems. The endocrine system reacts to unreliev ed pain b y releasing an ex cessiv e amount of hormones, ultimately resulting in carboh ydrate, protein, and fat catabolism, poor glucose utilization, and other harmful effects. This reaction combined with inflammatory processes can produce weight loss, tach ycardia, increased respir atory r ate, fev er, shock, and death. The cardio vascular system responds to the stress of unreliev ed pain b y activ ating the sympathetic nerv ous system. F ollowing a surgical procedure, for example, this can include hypercoagulation and increased heart r ate, blood pressure, cardiac workload, and o xygen demand. Since the stress response causes an increase in sympathetic nerv ous system activit y, intestinal secretions and smooth muscle sphincter tone increase, and gastric emptying and intestinal motilit y decrease. This response can cause tempor ary impairment of gastrointestinal function and increase the risk of ileus (intestinal obstruction). Aggressiv e pain control ma y be needed to reduce these effects and prev ent thromboembolic complications. Unreliev ed pain ma y be especially harmful for patients with metastatic cancers. Stress and pain can suppress immune function, including the natur al killer cells that pla y a role in preventing tumor growth and controlling metastasis. Defining and Categorizing PainOne of the most common definitions of pain comes from the International Association for the Study of P ain (IA SP), which describes pain as \"an unpleasant sensory and emotional experience associated with actual or potential tissue damage, or described in terms of such damage. \" When we are exposed to something that causes pain, if able, we quickly or reflexiv ely withdr aw. The sensory feeling of pain is called nociception . In the absence of an objectiv e measure, pain is a subjectiv e individual experience. How a person responds to pain is related to his or her genetic features and cognitiv e, motiv ational, emotional, and psy chological state. P ain response is also related to gender , experiences and memories of pain, cultur al and social influences, and gener al health (Sessle, 2012). Source: Veteran's Health Administration, 2015.Factors Influencing the Experience of Pain Physiologic/biologic factorsSite of injury or source of painful stimuli Intensity of stimulation/degree of tissue damage Type and density of receptors present Biologically based individual differences in pain threshold and sensitivity Psychological factorsEmotional status of the individual Individual beliefs and expectations regarding the experience of pain People's belief regarding their ability to establish control over the pain The individual's history of pain experiences and pain sensations (cultural and learning effec ts) General physical health of the person with pain Acute Pain Acute pain comes on quickly and can be sev ere, but lasts a relativ ely short time (IOM, 2011). It can be intensely uncomfortable. It usually has a well-defined location and an identifiable painful or no xious stimulus from an injury , brief disease process, surgical procedure, or dysfunction of muscle or viscer a. Acute pain alerts us to possible injury , inflammation, or disease and can arise from somatic or viscer al structures.Acute pain is often successfully treated with patient education, mild pain medications, environmental changes, and stress reduction, ph ysical ther apy, chiropr actic, massage therapy, acupuncture, or activ e movement progr ams. Acute pain is usually easier to treat than chronic pain. The Institute of Medicine (IOM) has targeted impro ved treatment of acute pain as an area of significant healthcare sa vings. The IOM states that better treatment of acute pain, through education about self -management and better clinical treatment, can a void its progression to chronic pain, which is more difficult and more expensiv e to treat (IOM, 2011). Chronic Pain Chronic pain gener ally refers to pain that exists for three or more months and does not resolv e with treatment. The three-month time fr ame is not absolute and some conditions may become chronic in as little as a month. Chronic pain is common; it affects 1 in 5 adults, is more prev alent among women and elders, and is associated with ph ysically demanding work and lower lev el of education (King & Fr aser, 2013). Chronic pain is a silent epidemic that reduces qualit y of life, negativ ely impacts relationships and jobs, and increases r ates of depression (Sessle, 2012). Chronic pain is a symptom of man y diseases. Up to 70% of cancer patients suffer from chronic pain and, among individuals living with HIV/AIDS , pain has been reported at all stages of infection (Lohman et al. , 2010). Chronic pain is also costly . A 2011 IOM report places this cost at more than $500 billion per year in the United States, creating an economic burden that is higher than the healthcare costs for heart disease, cancer , and diabetes combined. These economic costs stem from the cost of healthcare services, insur ance, welfare benefits, lost productivit y, and lost tax revenues (Sessle, 2012). Chronic pain is a multidimensional process that must be considered as a chronic degener ative disease not only affecting sensory and emotional processing, but also producing an altered br ain state (Borsook et al. , 2007). Chronic pain persists o ver time and is resistant to treatments and medications that ma y be effectiv e in the treatment of acute pain. Aspects of Chronic PainWhen pain becomes chronic, sensory path ways continue to tr ansmit the sensation of pain even though the underlying condition or injury that originally caused the pain has healed. In such situations, the pain itself ma y need to be managed separ ately from the underlying condition. Other aspects of chronic pain include: Chronic pain ma y express itself as a consequence of other conditions. F or example, chronic pain ma y arise after the onset of depression, ev en in patients without a prior pain history . Chronic pain patients are often defined as \"difficult patients\" in that they often ha ve neuropsy chologic changes that include changes in affect and motiv ation or changes in cognition, all of which r arely predate their pain condition. In some conditions such as complex regional pain syndrome (CRPS), manifestations of dysautonomia, mo vement disorders, and spreading pain (ipsilater al and contr alater al) are all indicativ e of complex secondary changes in the CNS that can follow a relativ ely trivial peripher al nerv e injury . Chronic opioid ther apy results in a h yperalgesic state (an increased sensitivit y to pain) in both experimental and clinical pain scenarios, implying changes in centr al processing. Opioids fail to produce pain relief in all individuals, ev en at high doses. This implies the dev elopment of \"analgesic resistance, \" a consequence of complex changes in neural systems in chronic pain that complicates the utilit y of opioids for long-term therapy. (Borsook et al. , 2007) Chronic pain can be difficult to distinguish from acute pain and, not surprisingly , clinicians have less success treating chronic pain than treating acute pain. Chronic pain does not resolv e quickly and opioids or sedativ es are often needed for treatment, which complicates the clinician-patient relationship . Because medical pr actitioners often approach chronic pain management from a medication perspectiv e, other modalities are sometimes o verlook ed. Chronic pain can affect ev ery aspect of life. It is associated with reduced activit y, impaired sleep, depression, and feelings of helplessness and hopelessness, and about one-fourth of people with chronic pain will experience ph ysical, emotional, and social deterior ation o ver time. Acute pain can progress to chronic pain. Whether this occurs can depend on a number of factors, including the a vailabilit y of treatment during the acute phase. F actors from birth, childhood, adolescence, and adulthood can also affect whether pain becomes chronic. Source: IOM, 2011.Lifespan Factors Affecting the Development of Chronic Pain From birth Genetics Female gender Minority race or ethnicity Parental anxiety Irregular feeding and sleeping Temperament and personality Childhood Childhood physical/sexual abuse Low socioeconomic status Hyperactivity Serious illness or injury Adolescence Learned reactions to pain Injuries Obesity Low levels of fitness Adulthood Vivid recall of childhood trauma Learned reactions to pain Lack of social support Overuse of joints and muscles Occupational exposure, job dissatisfaction Chronic disease Aging Musculosk eletal pain, especially joint and back pain, is the most common t ype of chronic pain (IOM, 2011). Although musculosk eletal pain ma y not correspond exactly to the area of injury , it is nev ertheless commonly classified according to pain location. Howev er, most people with chronic pain ha ve pain at multiple sites (Lillie et al. , 2013). Descr ibing Chronic Pain Acco rding to PathophysiologyWhen chronic pain is classified according to pathophysiology , three t ypes ha ve been described b y the International Association for the Study of P ain (IA SP): Nociceptive pain: caused b y stimulation of pain receptors Neuropathic pain: caused b y damage to the peripher al or centr al nerv ous system Psychogenic pain: caused or exacerbated b y psy chiatric disorders Nociceptive pain is caused b y activ ation or sensitization of peripher al nociceptors in the skin, cornea, mucosa, muscles, joints, bladder , gut, digestiv e tract, and a v ariety of internal organs. Nociceptors differ from mechanoreceptors, which sense touch and pressure, in that they are responsible for signaling potential damage to the body . Nociceptors ha ve a high threshold for activ ation and increase their output as the stimulus increases. Nociceptors respond to physical stimulation or chemical stimulation . In the ph ysical response, the free nerv e endings of the nociceptor (cell A in the diagr am below) will become deformed b y a sufficiently strong and deep stimulus, and in response send a pain signal. An injury triggers a complex set of chemical reactions as damaged cells release certain chemicals while immune cells reacting to the damage release additional chemicals. The nociceptor is exposed to this chemical \"soup ,\" and continues to send pain signals until the lev els of these pain-gener ating chemicals are lowered o ver time as the wound heals. A very similar mechanism is at work with itching sensations (Wikiv ersity, 2015).

Neuropathic pain is \"pain arising as a direct consequence of a lesion or disease affecting the somatosensory system\" (IA SP, 2012). It is usually described as a poorly localiz ed, electric shock -like, lancinating, shooting sensation originating from injury to a peripher al nerve, the spinal cord, or the br ain. It can cause a sensation of burning, pins and needles, electricit y, and numbness. Neuropathic pain can be associated with diabetic neuropath y, radiculopath y, post herpetic neur algia, phantom limb tumor -related nerv e compression, neuroma, or spinal nerv e compression. Neuropathic pain is classified as central or peripheral . Centr al pain originates from damage to the br ain or spinal cord. P eripher al pain originates from damage to the peripher al nerv es or nerv e plexuses, dorsal root ganglion, or nerv e roots (IA SP, 2012). Neuropathic pain tends to be long-lasting and difficult to treat. Opioids can be effectiv e, non-opioid medications as first -line ther apies. Use of SNRIs is common and frequently results in impro vement, but treatment of neuropathic pain is considered an off -label use for these agents. Simple analgesics ha ve not been shown to be effectiv e for this t ype of pain (IA SP, 2012).Psychogenic pain is defined as pain that persists despite the lack of an y identified underlying ph ysical cause. Although still commonly used, the term psychogenic pain it is no longer considered an official diagnostic term. A more correct diagnostic term is persistent somatoform pain disorder (PSPD). PSPD is defined in the ICD-10 V ersion 2016 as the predominant complaint is of persistent, sev ere, and distressing pain, which cannot be explained fully b y a ph ysiological process or a ph ysical disorder , and which occurs in association with emotional conflict or psy chosocial problems that are sufficient to allow the conclusion that they are the main causativ e influences. The result is usually a mark ed increase in support and attention, either personal or medical (ICD-10, Version 2016). Persistent somatoform pain disorder patients suffer from persistent, sev ere, and distressing pain without sufficient explanatory pathology . It is believ ed the pain originates from emotional conflicts or psy chosocial problems. This t ype of pain is usually nonresponsiv e to a v ariety of ther apies because of its unclear pathology . The absence of effectiv e treatment can result in ex cessiv e consumption of medical resources, in addition to social problems. P ersistent somatoform pain disorder seriously impacts the qualit y of life of patients and brings a great burden to societ y (Huang et al, 2016). The identification of PSPD as ha ving no ph ysiologic cause has done a great deal of damage to individuals with chronic pain. Man y healthcare professionals fail to recogniz e the complexit y of pain and believ e it can be explained based on the presence or absence of physical findings, secondary gain, or prior emotional problems. As a result, countless individuals ha ve been informed that \"the pain is all in y our head. \" And if these same individuals react with anger and hurt, clinicians sometimes compound the problem b y labeling the individual as hostile, demanding, or aggressiv e (VHA, 2015). The correspondence between ph ysical findings and pain complaints is fairly low (gener ally, 40%-60%). Individuals ma y have abnormal tests (eg, MRI shows a bulging disk) with no pain, or substantial pain with negativ e results. This is because chronic pain can dev elop in the absence of the gross sk eletal changes we are able to detect with current technology (VHA, 2015).Muscle str ain and inflammation are common causes of chronic pain, y et ma y be extremely difficult to detect. Other conditions ma y be due to systemic problems, tr auma to nerv es, circulatory difficulties, or CNS dysfunction. Y et in each of these cases we ma y be unable to \"see\" the cause of the problem. Instead, we ha ve to rely on the person' s report of their pain, coupled with beha vioral observ ations and indirect medical data. This does not mean that the pain is psy chogenic or has no underlying ph ysical cause. Instead it means that we are unable to detect or understand its cause (VHA, 2015). Actually , how often health y individuals feign pain for secondary gain is unknow able. In addition, the presence of secondary gain does not at all indicate that an individual' s pain is less \"real. \" In this country most individuals with chronic pain receiv e at least some t ype of benefit (not necessarily monetary) for pain complaints. Therefore, exagger ation of pain or related problems is to be expected. Unfortunately , practitioners ma y use the presence of secondary gain or pain amplification as an indication that the person' s pain is not real (VHA, 2015). Chronic Pain Syndromes In deciding how to treat chronic pain, it is important to distinguish between chronic pain and a chronic pain syndrome . A chronic pain syndrome differs from chronic pain in that people with a syndrome o ver time dev elop a number of related life problems bey ond the sensation of pain itself . It is important to distinguish between the two because they respond to different t ypes of treatment (VHA, 2015). Most individuals with chronic pain do not dev elop the more complicated and distressful chronic pain syndrome. Although they ma y experience the pain for the remainder of their lives, little change in their daily regimen of activities, family relationships, work, or other life components occurs. Man y of these individuals nev er seek treatment for pain and those who do often require less intensiv e, single-modalit y interv entions (VHA, 2015). Symptoms of Chronic Pain Syndrome Those who dev elop chronic pain syndrome tend to experience increasing ph ysical, emotional, and social deterior ation o ver time. They ma y abuse pain medications, and typically require more intensiv e, multimodal treatment to stop the cy cle of increasing dysfunction (VHA, 2015). Symptoms of Chronic Pain Syndrome Reduced activit y Impaired sleep Depression Suicidal ideation Social withdr awal Irritabilit y Fatigue Memory and cognitiv e impairment Poor self -esteem Less interest in sex Relationship problemsPain beha viors Kinesophobia* Helplessness Hopelessness Alcohol abuse Medication abuse Guilt Anxiet y Misbeha vior b y children in the home Loss of emplo yment * Avoidance of certain movements or activities due to fear of re-injury or re-experiencing the pain.

Complex R egional Pain Syndrome Complex regional pain syndrome (CRPS) is a gener al term for a sev ere chronic neuropathic pain condition that, in the past, w as referred to b y sev eral other names. Causalgia , from the Greek meaning heat and pain, w as the founding term for the syndrome. Causalgia w as first used to represent the burning nature of the pain, as seen within American Civil W ar casualties suffering tr aumatic bullet wounds (Dutton & Littlejohn, 2015). In the 1940s the term reflex sympathetic dystrophy was introduced when it w as thought the sympathetic nerv ous system pla yed a role in the disease. In 1994 a working group for the IA SP held a conference to dev elop a more neutr al term, to address the widespread inconsistency in terminology , and to a void unsubstantiated theory on causation and etiology . From this meeting came the officially endorsed term complex regional pain syndrome , intended to be descriptiv e, gener al, and not imply etiology . The term w as further divided into \"CRPS 1\" and \"CRPS 2. \" The current terminology represents a compromise and remains a work in progress. It will lik ely undergo modifications in the future as specific mechanisms of causation are better defined (Dutton & Littlejohn, 2015).CRPS I is char acteriz ed by intr actable pain that is out of proportion to the tr auma, while CRPS II is char acteriz ed by unrelenting pain that occurs subsequent to a nerv e injury . The criteria for diagnosing CRPS is difficult because of the v ast spectrum of disease presentations. They can include: Intractable pain out of proportion to an injury Intense burning pain Pain from non-injurious stimulation An exagger ated feeling of pain Temper ature changes in the affected body part Edema Motor/trophic disturbances, or Changes in skin, hair , and nails; and abnormal skin color . The pain in CRPS is regional, not in a specific nerv e territory or dermatome, and it usually affects the hands or feet, with pain that is disproportionate in sev erity to an y known trauma or underlying injury . It in volves a v ariety of sensory and motor symptoms including swelling and edema, discolor ation, joint stiffness, weakness, tremor , dystonia, sensory disturbances, abnormal patterns of sweating, and changes to the skin (O'Connell et al. , 2013). The acute phase of the condition is often char acteriz ed by edema and w armth and is thought to be supported b y neurogenic inflammation. Alter ations in CNS structure and function ma y be more important to the sustained pain and neurocognitiv e features of the chronic phase of the CRPS (Gallagher et al. , 2013). Complex Regional Pain Syndrome (CRPS) in Hand and Wrist Source: Wi kimedia Commons. Used by permission. CRPS usually dev elops following tr auma and is thought to in volve both centr al and peripher al components. Continuous pain is the most dev astating symptom of CRPS and has been reported to spread and worsen o ver time. P ain is usually disproportionate to the severity and dur ation of the inciting ev ent (Alexander et al. , 2013). CRPS has high impact in terms of individual, healthcare, and economic burden, yet continues to lack a clear biologic explanation and predictable, effectiv e treatment. Despite its sizable disease burden, its long history of identification, and a concentr ated research effort, man y significant challenges remain. These relate to issues of terminology , diagnostic criteria, predisposing factors, triggers, pathoph ysiology , and the ideal treatment path. There is also the challenge of the well-guarded notion that CRPS is not a true disease state, but r ather a condition with psy chological foundations (Dutton & Littlejohn, 2015). While acute CRPS sometimes impro ves with early and aggressiv e physical ther apy, CRPS present for a period of one y ear or more seldom spontaneously resolv es. The syndrome encompasses a dispar ate collection of signs and symptoms in volving the sensory , motor , and autonomic nerv ous systems, cognitiv e deficits, bone deminer alization, skin growth changes, and v ascular dysfunction (Gallagher et al. , 2013). Although numerous drugs and interv entions ha ve been tried in attempts to treat CRPS , reliev e pain, and restore function, a cure remains elusiv e. Two analyses ha ve attempted to develop evidence-based guidelines for the treatment of CRPS . One co vers trials in the period between 1980 and June 2005; the second co vers the period from June 2000 to February 2012. The earlier review identified the following treatments that had v arying degrees of cord ph ysical ther apy regimens (Inchiosa, 2013) Positiv e findings to v arying degrees in the more recent analysis were as follows: Low-dose k etamine infusionsBisphosphonates Oral tadalafil and clonidine Intravenous immunoglobulin da y (with morphine) Physical ther apy Spinal cord stimulation and tr anscr anial magnetic stimulation impro ved symptoms, but only tr ansiently (Inchiosa, 2013). In the past it w as common to explain the etiology of complex regional pain syndrome using the psy chogenic model. Now howev er, neurocognitiv e deficits, neuroanatomic abnormalities, and distortions in cognitiv e mapping are known to be features of CRPS pathology . More important, man y people who ha ve dev eloped CRPS ha ve no history of mental illness. With increased education about CRPS through a biopsy chosocial perspectiv e, both ph ysicians and mental health pr actitioners can better diagnose, treat, and manage CRPS symptomatology (Hill et al. , 2012). Video (2:31): What is Chronic Pain? https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GTmE5X8NcXM Pain Management Approaches Stanfor d's Sean Mack , PhD on \"What Chr onic PhD on \"What is Chr onic ......The management of pain can be, and is, approached in a number of w ays. Man y people suffering from pain, particularly acute pain, successfully self -manage their pain. If this fails, a trip to primary care ph ysician, emergency department, pain specialist, or complementary pr actitioner ma y help . If none of these solv es the problem, surgery ma y be considered. Broadly speaking, pain has been managed with either of two models: self -management or pain medicine. The self -management model\u2014especially for chronic pain\u2014is supported b y strong evidence and has the benefit of in volving patients in their own care. The pain medicine model, which includes primary and specialt y care, is supported b y relativ ely weak evidence, particularly in chronic pain care, and often fails to in volve the recipient as an active participant. Although the pain medicine model has weak er demonstr ated efficacy , it is widely used because of a strong business model, industry support, and focus of tr aining in healthcare professionals (NIH, 2013). Three Approaches to Pain Management 1. The Self -Management Model 2. The P ain Medicine Model 3. The Integr ative Medicine Model Increasingly , howev er, pain medicine approaches are being combined with self - management and complementary pr actices into what is referred to as integrative medicine . In this model, pain is viewed holistically , and assessed and treated in conjunction with psy chological, medical, social, spiritual, and en vironmental influences. Currently , an integr ative approach to pain care is encour aged for all patients (PPSG, 2014b). Self-Management of Pain Self-management is defined as a str ategy used b y the patient to manage or minimiz e the impact of a chronic condition on ev eryday life. The basic tenets of self -management include: Active participation b y the patient Treatment of the whole person, not just the disease Empowerment of the patient (NIH, 2013)Although some people seek professional help immediately , most try to self -manage their pain. Self -management approaches include talking to friends, searching the internet, or attending group classes or progr ams intended to educate a person about pain management. Self -management also includes ex ercise, ice, heat, positioning, limiting activit y, over-the-counter (O TC) medications, and education. In man y cases, self - management is highly successful. Pain Medicine Model The pain medicine model is widely accepted and widely used. It is based upon the idea that pain is an acute, treatable disease. This approach usually begins with the primary care physician. Primary care ph ysicians ma y mak e a referr al to a pain specialist or pain clinic. Primary Care Primary care pr actitioners are an early step in the pain care journey , treating 52% of chronic pain patients in the United States based on a national mail surv ey of primary care physicians, ph ysician pain specialists, chiropr actors, and acupuncturists (IOM, 2011). Primary care in volves sev eral management str ategies, usually coordinated b y a gener al medicine specialist. Primary care clinicians pro vide the initial assessment or diagnosis and serve as a starting point for specialt y services, including prescription medications and referr als to imaging, ph ysical and occupational ther apy, or other integr ative practitioners (IOM, 2011). Once the primary care clinician has completed the initial assessment, effectiv e medical management, especially with chronic pain, ideally in volves a multi-disciplinary team. The development of a comprehensiv e treatment plan is important, utilizing appropriate pharmacologic and nonpharmacologic interv entions. T reatments should be regularly re- evaluated for effectiv eness, adjusted as needed, with side effects quickly addressed. The treatment plan should include a complete assessment and a clearly written plan of care (PPSG, 2014b). Primary care clinicians assist patients in making decisions about specialt y services and electiv e procedures. They are also responsible for the majorit y of pain medicine prescriptions. In 2007 analgesics were the drug category most frequently mentioned in data on office visits to ph ysicians. In 2008 analgesics constituted 10.1% of all drugs prescribed for adults (r anking a close second to antidepressants, at 10.8%) (IOM, 2011). Specialty CareSpecialt y practice in pain management is a growing part of the medical profession, and the American Medical Association recogniz es pain medicine as a discrete specialt y. Most pain specialists come from anesthesiology , with a smaller number coming from ph ysical and rehabilitation medicine, occupational medicine, psy chiatry , and neurology (IOM, 2011). Physicians who are board certified in these specialt y areas can become certified in pain medicine. From 2000 to 2009, pain medicine certificates were issued to 1,874 anesthesiologists, 1,337 ph ysiatrists, and 277 psy chiatrists and neurologists, based on a common curriculum and a jointly dev eloped examination administered b y the American Board of Anesthesiology (IOM, 2011). Acute Pain Services Many hospitals ha ve dev eloped acute pain services (APS), the goal of which is to pro vide consistent pain management for individual patients throughout the course of their hospital stay. Hospitals with formally organiz ed acute pain services are more lik ely to follow a formal written post oper ative pain protocol than hospitals without acute pain services (Nasir et al. , 2011). A surv ey of the structure and function of acute pain services in 200 non-teaching and 101 teaching hospitals throughout the United States found that acute pain services v ary significantly , with univ ersity/academic institutions being more lik ely to offer these services than priv ate or V eteran's Administr ation (V A) hospitals. Howev er, even in those hospitals with formal acute pain services, man y lack ed consensus regarding the use of pain management protocols as well as optimal outcome measures for assessing post oper ative pain ther apy (Nasir et al. , 2011). Percentage of Hospitals with Acute Pain Service Percentage of responding hospitals with an organized acute pain service. Source: Nasir et al., 2011. The personnel comprising the t ypical acute pain service included: Anesthesiologists (95%) Advanced pr actice (45%), registered nurses (32.5%), pharmacists (11.3%) Physician assistants (8.8%) Physical medicine and rehabilitation ph ysicians (6.3%) Surgeons (5%) Neurologists (3.8%) Others (oncologists, social work ers, and psy chologists) (Nasir et al. , 2011) Treating Pain in the Emergency Department The emergency department has become a common place to seek treatment for pain. The very nature of the ED means that in most cases the a verage emergency medicine specialist is primarily concerned with differential diagnosis, ruling out life-threatening disease, and providing stabilizing interv entions. F or the patient, though, the priorities are lik ely to include pain management (Thomas, 2013). In a telephone surv ey of 500 adults, the American Chronic P ain Association sought to understand the ED experience of those with chronic or recurrent pain. Almost one-half reported \"complete\" or \"a great deal\" of pain relief during the ED visit, while 78% endorsed as \"somewhat or definitely true\" that \"the ED staff understood how to treat m y pain. \" Although more than three-fourths of patients felt that receiving additional information on pain management or referr als to specialists w as extremely or v ery important, only one-half reported receiving them. A significant minorit y (11%) reported that the \"ED staff made me feel lik e I was just seeking drugs. \" The majorit y (76%) were somewhat to completely satisfied with their treatment, while 24% were neutr al or completely dissatisfied. Age, recurrent pain, w aiting time, imaging, receiving analgesics, and pain relief predicted patient satisfaction (T odd et al. , 2010). When older adults are treated for pain in the ED , the usual issue is less one of assessment than one of concern for side effects; older patients are simply more lik ely than y ounger patients to suffer untow ard side effects of man y popular ED analgesics such as opioids. A balancing of the risks and benefits of analgesia in older patients is important, and should be discussed with patients and families. The challenge of geriatric analgesia can often be overcome through use of opioid-sparing analgesic regimens or emplo yment of specific therapies (eg, regional nerv e blocks for hip fr actures) (Thomas, 2013). Interventional and Surgical Treatments Interv entional techniques are minimally in vasive procedures that place drugs in targeted areas or ablate target nerv es. This category includes some surgical techniques such as laser or endoscopic discectom y, intrathecal infusion pumps, and spinal cord stimulators, used for the diagnosis and management of chronic, persistent, or intr actable pain (Manchikanti et al. , 2010). Epidur al injections, in which steroids and anti- inflammatories are injected directly into the epidur al space of the spinal cord are the most commonly performed procedures in interv entional pain management, comprising 46% of all interv entional techniques. The most commonly performed procedures are lumbosacr al interlaminar or caudal epidur al injections. Facet joint interv entions are the second most commonly performed procedures, constituting 38% of all interv entional techniques in 2011 (Manchikanti et al. , 2010).Steroids are injected into the cerebrospinal fluid in the canal surrounding the spine. Nerves branch out from the spine. The nerve roots, which may be compressed, are at the base of the nerves. Source: Blausen.com staff. \"Blausen gallery 2014.\" (CT-RF) is another minimally in vasive procedure in which a thermal lesion is created b y applying r adiofrequency energy through an electrode placed in the vicinit y of the target neural structure. It has been used for some time in cardiac electroph ysiology and tumor ablation although its use in the treatment of pain is recent. A v ariation\u2014 water- cooled r adiofrequency (WC -RF) ablation\u2014 allows a larger volume of the tissue to be heated and the resultant thermal lesion is substantially larger than with conventional thermal r adiofrequency (Malik et al. , 2011). These techniques are most commonly applied to the interv ertebr al disc and sacroiliac joints. There is growing evidence of a disproportionate increase in these interv entional techniques and the usefulness of some has been criticiz ed. Analysis of v arious spinal interv entional techniques indicates that there has been an overall increase in interv entions of 177% per 100,000 Medicare fee-for -service population with the highest increases seen for sacroiliac joint injections at 331%, facet joint interv entions epidur als at 130% (Manchikanti systematic review of interv entional ther apies interv entional ther apies for back pain ha ve been shown to be effectiv e in randomiz ed, placebo-controlled trials. \" A systematic review of 18 r andomiz ed controlled trials found no strong evidence for or against using injection ther apy to treat subacute or chronic low back pain (IOM, 2011). A review of 30 trials determined that corticosteroid injections (and tr action) were not found to be beneficial and are not recommended for lumbosacr al radicular syndrome (IOM, 2011). Implantation of spinal cord stimulation and intr athecal drug deliv ery systems (so- called pain pumps) require routine monitoring, replacement of devices o ver time, refilling of drug reserv oirs, and a balancing of high costs and maintenance requirements against benefits (IOM, 2011). Although interv entional techniques are often considered to be surgical procedures, more invasive procedures such as joint replacement, spinal fusion, and disc replacement are also commonly and successfully used to reliev e pain. These t ypes of surgeries often occur after other conserv ative treatments ha ve failed to reliev e the pain.Common Pain Conditions Despite the difficult y in classif ying and understanding v arious mechanisms of pain, certain pain syndromes are perv asive. Low back pain, headache pain, post oper ative pain, cancer pain, and pain associated with arthritis are some of the most common reasons patients seek medical care for pain. A National Health Interview Surv ey of adults during 1997-2014 found that in the three months prior to an interview , participants reported: 28% had experienced pain in the lower back 16% had experienced a migr aine or sev ere headache 14% had experienced pain in the neck area (NCHS , 2016) Low Back Pain Low back pain (LBP) is one of the most common t ypes of disabilit y affecting individuals in Western countries. Low back pain affects appro ximately 80% of people at some stage in their liv es, and if it becomes chronic it often results in lost w ages and additional medical expenses and can increase the risk of incurring other medical conditions (Chou et al. , 2016). Chronic low back pain has been estimated to cost 2% of the gross domestic product in dev eloped countries (Sit et al. , 2015). In the United States, the total indirect and direct costs due to low back pain are estimated to be greater than $100 billion annually (W ang et al. , 2012). It is the fifth most common reason for all ph ysician visits. Appro ximately one-quarter of U .S. adults reported ha ving low back pain lasting at least 1 da y in the past 3 months, and 7.6% reported at least one episode of sev ere low back pain in the previous y ear. Clinically , the natur al course of low back pain is usually fa vorable; acute low back pain frequently disappears within 1 to 2 weeks. In some cases acute low back pain becomes chronic and difficult to treat. An y of the spinal structures, including interv ertebr al discs, facet joints, v ertebr al bodies, ligaments, or muscles could be an origin of back pain, which is, unfortunately , difficult to determine. In those cases in which the origin of back pain cannot be determined, the diagnosis giv en is nonspecific low back pain (Aoki et al. , 2012). Assessing Low Back PainThe v ast majorit y of low back pain patients who present to primary care ha ve pain that cannot be reliably attributed to a specific disease or spinal abnormalit y. Spinal imaging abnormalities such as degener ative disc disease, facet joint arthropath y, and bulging or herniated interv ertebr al discs are extremely common in patients with or without low back pain, particularly in older adults, and such findings are poor predictors for the presence or severity of low back pain (Chou et al. , 2016). Low back pain symptoms can arise from man y anatomic sources, such as nerv e roots, muscle, fascia, bones, joints, interv ertebr al discs, and organs within the abdominal ca vity. Symptoms can also be caused b y aberr ant neurologic pain processing, a condition called neuropathic low back pain. The diagnostic ev aluation of patients with low back pain can be challenging and requires complex clinical decision-making. Nev ertheless, the identification of the source of the pain is of fundamental importance in determining the ther apeutic approach (Allegri et al. , 2016). The location of pain, frequency of symptoms, dur ation of pain, history of previous symptoms, previous treatments, and response to treatment should be assessed. The possibilit y of low back pain due to pancreatitis, nephrolithiasis, or aortic aneurysm, or systemic illnesses such as endocarditis or vir al syndromes, should also be considered. Low back pain can be influenced b y psy chological factors, such as stress, depression, or anxiet y. History should include substance use exposure, detailed health history , work habits, and psy chosocial factors (Allegri et al. , 2016). Back pain can be referred or felt at a site distant from the source of the pain. P ain can be local or referred from a painful stimulus occurring in an internal organ. An example of referred pain is when a heart attack occurs and pain in felt in the ja w, shoulder , or arm. Pain ma y also be felt in the territory of a dermatome , an area of skin supplied b y a single sensory nerv e. This is referred to as r adiating pain and can be quite confusing for patients. If the nerv e root is irritated or inflamed, pain can be ev oked by any motion that stretches or compresses the root of the nerv e. This is referred to as radicular pain , which can occur in patients with serious or progressiv e neurologic deficits or underlying conditions requiring prompt ev aluation, as well as patients with other conditions that ma y respond to specific treatments.Patients with back and leg pain ha ve a fairly high sensitivit y for herniated disc, with more than 90% of symptomatic lumbar disc herniation occurring at the L4/L5 and L5/S1 lev els. A focused examination that includes str aight leg-r aise testing and a neurologic examination that includes ev aluation of knee strength and reflex es (L4 nerv e root), great toe and nerv e foot reflex es (S1 nerv e root), and distribution of sensory symptoms should be done to assess the presence and sev erity of nerv e root dysfunction. Imaging tests such as magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) should be considered only in the presence of clinical elements that are not definitely clear or in the presence of neurologic deficits or other medical conditions. The recommendation of the American College of Radiology is to not do imaging for low back pain within the first 6 weeks unless red flags are present. R ed flags include recent significant tr auma or milder tr auma at age older than 50 years, unexplained weight loss, unexplained fev er, immunosuppression, history of cancer , intravenous drug use, prolonged use of corticosteroids, osteoporosis, age older than 70 y ears, and focal neurologic deficits with progressiv e or disabling symptoms (Allegri et al., 2016). Treating Low Back Pain Despite the negativ e impact and increasing prev alence of low back pain, patients are regularly ignored and their complaints are often misunderstood. As a result, they often do not receiv e timely or effectiv e treatment. This issue poses consider able challenges and frustr ations for healthcare pro viders and can create a feeling of mistrust among patients. Ample evidence demonstr ates that clinicians' attitudes and beliefs regarding low back pain seem to affect the beliefs of their patients. Ph ysicians' attitudes and beliefs also appear to influence their recommendations regarding activities and work (Sit et al. , 2015). Multiple treatment options for acute and chronic low back pain are a vailable. Broadly , these can be classified as pharmacologic treatments, nonin vasive nonpharmacologic treatments, injection al. , Nonpharmacologic treatments include ex ercise and related therapy, interferential ther apy, superficial heat or cold, back supports, and multidisciplinary rehabilitation (Chou et al. , 2016). Migraine HeadachesA migr aine is a v ery painful headache thought to result from v asodilation of blood v essels in the br ain. Migr aines cause intense, pulsing or throbbing pain on one or possibly both sides of the head. P eople with migr aine headaches often describe pain in the temples or behind one ey e or ear . Migr aine sufferers ma y also ha ve symptoms of nausea, v omiting, and sensitivit y to light and sound. Some people see spots or flashing lights or ha ve a tempor ary loss of vision that forew arn of an impending headache. If a migr aine occurs more than 15 da ys each month for 3 months, it is considered chronic. Migraines often start in the morning, and the pain can last from a few hours up to two days. These headaches can occur as often as sev eral times per week for some patients or as infrequently as once or twice a y ear. For man y with migr aines, the qualit y of life and activit y is greatly diminished during attacks, and their frequency can interfere with the ability to work or to perform activities of daily living. Migr aine headaches are still under - diagnosed and under -treated because they can ha ve features in common with other t ypes of headache. Over time, episodes of migr aine headache afflict patients with increased frequency , longer duration, and more intense pain. While episodic migr aine ma y be defined as 1 to 14 attacks per month, there are no clear -cut phases defined, and those patients with low frequency ma y progress to high frequency episodic migr aine and the latter ma y progress into chronic daily headache (>15 attacks per month) (Maleki et al. , 2011). Numerous imaging studies of migr aine patients ha ve described multiple changes in br ain functions as a result of migr aine attacks: these include enhanced cortical ex citabilit y, increased gr ay matter v olume in some regions and decreased in others, enhanced br ain blood flow , and altered pain modulatory systems (Maleki et al. , 2011). Migraine has no cure. Drug ther apies are broadly divided into two groups: (1) those designed to treat acute occurrences, and (2) those that are proph ylactic (prev entive) in nature. Man y people with migr aine use both forms of treatment. The goal is to treat migraine symptoms as soon as possible and to minimiz e the number of migr aine occurrences b y avoiding triggers. The treatment of an individual migr aine attack once it has occurred (\"acute treatment \"), is commonly referred to as abortive therapy . Four major medications are used for abortiv e therapy: The triptans1. Ergotamine2. Dihydroergotamine ver-the-counter (O TC) pain medications such as aspirin, acetaminophen (T ylenol), or NS AIDs lik e ibuprofen (Advil, Motrin), ma y be sufficient. Some combination medicines are sold specifically for migr aines (eg, Ex cedrin Migraine, which contains aspirin, acetaminophen, and caffeine) but these are usually not strong enough for sev ere migr aines. The patient needs to understand that taking migr aine medications more than 3 da ys a week ma y lead to rebound headaches \u2014headaches that keep coming back, in part because of the medications. Many migr aine medicines work b y narrowing blood v essels to counter act vasodilation in the vessels of the br ain. Caution is advised if the patient has risk for heart attacks or has heart disease. Ergots should not be giv en if the patient is pregnant or planning to become pregnant. Pain Following Surgery Pain following surgery is v ery common. In the United States, nearly 100 million surgeries take place annually \u2014about 46 million inpatient and about 53 million outpatient procedures. Good post surgical pain management is associated with patient satisfaction, earlier mobilization, shortened hospital sta ys, and reduced costs. Post oper ative pain can be caused b y tissue damage, the presence of dr ains and tubes, post oper ative complications, prolonged time in an a wkward position, or a combination of these factors. P ost oper ative pain is often under -estimated and under -treated, leading to increased morbidit y and mortalit y, mostly due to respir atory and thromboembolic complications, increased hospital sta y, and impaired qualit y of life (EA U, 2013). There is a pressing need for impro vements in post oper ative pain management \u2014about 70% of post surgical patients report pain that is moder ate, sev ere, or extreme (EA U, 2013) and fewer than half of those patients report adequate post surgical pain control (IOM, 2011). F ailure to adequately control post oper ative pain driv es up costs and is thought to be a factor in the dev elopment of chronic pain (Chapman et al. , 2012). Good post oper ative pain management requires good pain assessment and measurement in all post oper ative patients. Assessment should focus on the patient 's response to surgery as well as respir atory and cardiac complications. Assessment should occur at scheduled interv als, in response to new pain, and prior to discharge (EA U, 2013).Midrin, a combination of isometheptene mucate, dichlor alphenaz one, and acetaminophen4.Although much of the focus on post oper ative pain management is on hospitals, about 60% of surgical procedures in communit y hospitals are performed on an outpatient basis, and persistent problems exist with pain management after discharge (IOM, 2011). This ma y be because there is not enough time to assess post surgical pain prior to discharge or to establish a pain management progr am at home. Psychological factors such as anxiet y and depression can be important predictors in the development of post oper ative pain. Age has also been found as a predictor , with y ounger individuals being at higher risk for moder ate to intense pain. P atients at high risk for severe post oper ative pain should be pro vided with special attention. P atients with good analgesia are more cooper ative, reco ver more r apidly , and lea ve the hospital sooner . They also ha ve a lower risk for prolonged pain after surgery (Ene et al. , 2008). Persistent Post Surgical Pain The International Association for the Study of P ain (IA SP) refers to post oper ative pain that continues for more than 2 months and cannot be explained b y other causes \"persistent post surgical pain\" (K ehlet & R athmell, 2010). A percentage of post oper ative patients (10%-50%) dev elop persistent pain following common surgical procedures such as groin hernia repair , breast and thor acic surgery , leg amputation, and coronary artery b ypass surgery , often due to nerv e damage during the procedure (IOM, 2011). Many patients suffer from moder ate to sev ere post oper ative pain despite recent impro vements in pain treatment. Sev ere pain is associated with decreased patient satisfaction, dela yed post oper ative ambulation, the dev elopment of chronic or persistent post oper ative pain, increased incidence of pulmonary and cardiac complications, and increased morbidit y and mortalit y (Ghoneim & O'Har a, 2016). Chronic or persistent post surgical pain is a serious clinical problem. It is a common reason for early retirement and unemplo yment and represents an extensiv e drain on societies' resources. The factors that seem to affect its incidence include the extent of preoper ative pain, tr auma during surgery , and anxiet y and depression. Cancer patients seem particularly susceptible (Ghoneim & O'Har a, 2016). In a systematic review of the psy chosocial predictors and correlates for chronic post surgical pain, depression w as a strong predictor . Comorbidit y of pain and depression provokes worsening of both conditions. It is important therefore to identif y patients at high risk for its dev elopment and optimiz e their management (Ghoneim & O'Har a, 2016).Chronic, persistent post surgical pain influences patients' qualit y of life (ev en after minor surgical procedures) and is currently regarded as an important outcome reflecting the qualit y of perioper ative care pro vided to patients. A recent study just confirmed that moder ate-to-sev ere persistent post surgical pain is common after outpatient surgery (ie, ambulatory and short -stay procedures), and inguinal hernia repair is a v ery common surgical procedure, often performed on an ambulatory base (Bugada et al. , 2016). Among risk factors for persistent post surgical pain dev elopment, the sev erity of acute post operative pain is often mentioned, which implies that individuals prone to suffer intense post oper ative pain ma y be the most vulner able to persistent post surgical pain. Howev er, not ev ery patient with sev ere post oper ative pain will later dev elop persistent post surgical pain (Bugada et al. , 2016). To identif y the scope of a person' s pain following surgery , especially pain persisting more than 2 to 3 months after surgery , a careful clinical ev aluation is needed. This includes history , physical examination, and appropriate special tests in order to identif y or ex clude reversible underlying conditions (Gilron & K ehlet, 2014). Be a ware of risk of persistent pain following surgery in the following instances: If the patient w as previously pain free but has now dev eloped a new chronic pain syndrome If previous pain at the site of surgery still remains If the patient previously suffered from a chronic pain syndrome\u2014unrelated to the surgery \u2014and the pain persists (Gilron & K ehlet, 2014) Pain in the ICU Most, if not all, patients in intensiv e care units (ICUs) will experience pain at some point during their ICU sta y. Pain can be related to injury , surgery , burns, or comorbidities, such as cancer , or from procedures performed for diagnostic or treatment purposes. Some patients ma y even experience substantial pain at rest. Despite increased attention to assessment and pain management, pain remains a significant problem for ICU patients (Kyranou & Puntillo , 2012). Unreliev ed pain in adult ICU patients is far from benign. Medical and surgical ICU patients who recalled pain and other tr aumatic situations while in the ICU had a higher incidence of chronic pain and post tr aumatic stress disorder symptoms than did a compar ative group of ICU patients. Concurrent or past pain ma y be the greatest risk factor for dev elopment of chronic pain (K yranou & Puntillo , 2012). Pain Associated with CancerPain occurs in 20% to 50% of patients with cancer (NCI, 2016). It is one of the most severe, feared, and common symptoms of a v ariety of cancers and is a primary determinant of the poor qualit y of life in cancer patients (Bali et al. , 2013). Cancer - associated pain\u2014particularly neuropathic pain\u2014has been shown to be resistant to conventional ther apeutics whose application ma y be sev erely limited due to widespread side effects (Bali et al. , 2013). Pain from cancer tends to increase in sev erity as the cancer adv ances, and patients often experience pain at multiple sites concurrently . The highest prev alence of sev ere pain occurs in adult patients with adv anced cancer . There ma y be multiple mechanisms with distinct patterns, such as continuous pain, mo vement -related pain, and spontaneous breakthrough pain. As cancer reaches the adv anced stage, moder ate to sev ere pain affects roughly 80% of patients. Y ounger patients are more lik ely to experience cancer pain and pain flares than are older patients (NCI, 2016). Research from Europe, Asia, A ustralia, and the United States indicates that cancer patients are repeatedly undertreated for pain, both as inpatients and outpatients\u2014sometimes receiving no analgesia at all. R egardless of what stage the cancer has reached, it is necessary to determine the prev alence of pain in specific cancer t ypes, both to r aise awareness among clinicians and to impro ve patient management (K uo et al. , 2011). Classify ing Cancer Pain Classif ying cancer pain can be a challenge because the pain often does not ha ve a single cause. P ain can be acute or chronic and can v ary in intensit y over time. Acute pain is typically induced b y tissue injury and diminishes o ver time as the tissue heals. Chronic pain persists after an injury has healed or becomes recurrent o ver months; or results from lesions unlik ely to regress or heal (NCI, 2016). T umors, which occup y space, can also cause pain b y pressing on skin, nerv es, bones, and organs. Breakthrough pain is common in cancer patients. It is a tempor ary increase or flare of pain that occurs in the setting of relativ ely well-controlled acute or chronic pain. Incident pain is a t ype of breakthrough pain related to certain activities or factors such as v ertebr al body pain from metastatic disease. Breakthrough and incident pain are often difficult to treat effectiv ely because of their episodic nature. In one study , 75% of patients experienced breakthrough pain; 30% of this pain w as incidental, 26% w as non-incidental, 16% w as caused b y end-of -dose failure, and the rest had mix ed etiologies (NCI, 2016).Pain can be a side-effect of ther apies used to treat cancer . A systematic review of the literature identified reports of pain occurring in 59% of patients receiving anti-cancer treatment and in 33% of patients after cur ative treatments (NCI, 2016). Some pain syndromes that can be caused b y cancer ther apies 10% to 20% complications and chemotherapy (acute herpetic neur algia, tingling or burning in their palms and soles, r ash) Pain from supportive care therapies (osteonecrosis, a vascular necrosis) Radiation-induced pain (mucositis, mucosal inflammation in areas receiving radiation, pain flares, and r adiation dermatitis) (NCI, 2016) The Pain Ladder Although cancer pain or other symptoms often cannot be entirely eliminated, a vailable therapies can effectiv ely reliev e pain in most patients. Good pain management impro ves a patient 's qualit y of life throughout all stages of the disease. P atients with adv anced cancer may experience multiple concurrent symptoms with pain. In these patients, a thorough assessment of symptoms and appropriate management is needed for optimal qualit y of life (NCI, 2016). The P ain Ladder w as dev eloped b y the W orld Health Organization (WHO) in the context of cancer care. The WHO three-step analgesic ladder presents a stepped approach based on pain sev erity. If the pain is mild, begin with Step 1. This in volves the use of analgesics such as acetaminophen or an NS AID, while k eeping in mind potential renal and gastrointestinal adv erse effects (WHO , 2016). If pain persists or worsens despite appropriate dose increases, a change to a Step 2 or Step 3 analgesic is indicated. Most patients with cancer pain will require a Step 2 or Step 3 analgesic. Step 1 can be skipped in fa vor of Step 2 or Step 3 in patients presenting at the onset with moder ate-to-sev ere pain. A t each step , an adjuv ant drug or modalit y such as radiation ther apy may be considered in selected patients. W orld Health Organization recommendations are based on worldwide a vailabilit y of drugs and not strictly on pharmacology (WHO , 2016).In gener al, analgesics should be giv en \"by mouth, by the clock, by the ladder, and for the individual \" and should include regular scheduling of the analgesic, not just on an as- needed basis. In addition, rescue doses for breakthrough pain should be added. The or al route is preferred as long as a patient is able to sw allow. Each analgesic regimen should be adjusted for the patient 's individual circumstances and ph ysical condition (NCI, 2013). World Health Organization Analgesic Ladder Source: Ad apted from WHO, 1986. Used with permission. Clinical management of cancer pain is complex, driv en by patient 's response, and the need to have both shorter and longer acting prepar ations and equi- analgesic dose r atios. The process of combining or switching opioids is complex for the clinician, who must understand the different half -life, receptors, and con version r atios of these opioids, which can v ary greatly among individuals, opioids, and ev en by opioid dose (Gao et al. , 2014). Adjuv ants medications can enhance the analgesic effect of opioid drugs in patients with cancer . Concurrent use of adjuv ants is recommended b y the W orld Health Organization and has been recogniz ed as one of the effectiv e strategies in impro ving the balance between analgesia and side effects. Howev er, consistent evidence suggests an under -utilization of adjuv ants in cancer pain management, which ma y contribute to unnecessary opioid switching or rotation (Gao et al. , 2014). Pain Associated with Arthritis Arthritis and other rheumatic conditions are a leading cause of disabilit y in adults in the United States. The negativ e consequences of arthritis and other rheumatic conditions, including pain, reduced ph ysical abilit y, depression, and reduced qualit y of life, can impact the ph ysical functioning and psy chological well-being of those living with the conditions (Schoffman et al. , 2013). Treatment of arthritis and other rheumatic conditions is costly , and giv en the growing number of people in the United States o ver the age of 65, arthritis and other rheumatic conditions are expected to be a large burden on the healthcare system in the coming years. The number of Americans with arthritis and other rheumatic conditions is expected to reach about 67 million b y 2030, meaning that 25% of Americans will ha ve arthritis and other rheumatic conditions (Schoffman et al. , 2013). Osteoarthritis Osteoarthritis (OA) is a joint disorder , char acteriz ed by degener ation of joint cartilage. It causes joint pain and stiffness that worsens o ver time. OA is the most common form of arthritis and affects close to 27 million Americans. After the age of 65, 60% of men and 70% of women experience OA (V an Liew et al. , 2013). In a health y joint, the ends of bones are encased in smooth cartilage. They are protected by a joint capsule lined with a syno vial membr ane that produces syno vial fluid. The capsule and fluid protect the cartilage, muscles, and connectiv e tissues. With osteoarthritis, the cartilage becomes worn a way. Spurs grow out from the edge of the bone, and syno vial fluid increases, causing stiffness and pain (NIAMS , 2015). Hip Joint Showing Osteoarthritis Progression Left: Normal hip joint. Right: Hip joint with osteoarthritis. Source: Wi kimedia Commons. Osteoarthritis most often occurs in the hands (at the ends of the fingers and thumbs), spine (neck and lower back), knees, and hips. Source: NIAMS, 2015.Although the prev alence of osteoarthritis increases with age, younger people can also dev elop it, usually as the result of a joint injury , a joint malformation, or a genetic defect in joint cartilage. Before age 45, more men than women ha ve osteoarthritis; after age 45, it is more common in women. OA is more lik ely to occur in people who are o verweight and in those with jobs that stress particular joints. The joints most commonly affected b y OA are those at the ends of the fingers, thumbs, neck, lower back, knees, and hips (NIAMS , 2015). Best pr actice guidelines for chronic osteoarthritis focus on self - management: weight control, ph ysical activit y, and pharmacologic support for inflammation and pain. Although low -grade inflammation underlies chronic osteoarthritis, it has not been a focus of best pr actice guidelines, particularly of its nonpharmacologic management. Obesit y is an independent risk factor for osteoarthritis and there is an inter active relationship among osteoarthritis, obesit y, and ph ysical inactivit y (see figure below). Although the mechanisms for this association are not completely understood, biomechanical loading and metabolic inflammation associated with ex cess adipose tissue and lipids ma y have a role (Dean & Hansen, 2012). Etiology of Chronic Low-Grade Systemic Infection Relationships among osteoarthritis, obesity, and physical inactivity and association with the etiology of chronic low-grade systemic inflammation. Source: Dean & Hansen, 2012. Used by permission. Pain associated with osteoarthritis can lead to decreased ph ysical activit y, which is an independent risk factor for inflammation, lik ely due to the reduced expression of anti- inflammatory mediators. Ph ysical inactivit y also reduces daily energy expenditure and promotes weight gain (Dean & Hansen, 2012). Appro ximately 80% of adults with OA ha ve some mo vement limitations that affect daily activities; this is related to reduced qualit y of life and lower self -confidence. Ha ving high levels of self -confidence is associated with higher qualit y of life, decreased pain, and increased activit y for all people including those with OA (V an Liew et al. , 2013). Physical ex ercise is widely recommended for individuals with OA. A meta- analysis on treatments for OA found that ex ercise progr ams reduced pain, impro ved ph ysical functioning, and enhanced qualit y of life among individuals with OA (V an Liew et al. , 2013). Despite this, close to 44% of adults with arthritis report not engaging in ex ercise.Psychological distress is an important factor associated with ex ercise and qualit y of life among people with OA. Evidence suggests that anxiet y and depression lead to reduced functioning and to lower lev els of ph ysical activit y. Although depression ma y pose barriers to activit y engagement, ph ysical activit y has been shown to impro ve its symptoms and is a common focus vioral ther apies. Con versely , impro vements in are also likely to lead to increases in activit y levels and qualit y of life (V an Liew et al. , 2013). Rheumatoid Arthritis Rheumatoid arthritis (RA) is among the most disabling forms of arthritis and it affects about 1% of the U .S. adult population (about 2 million people). RA is an autoimmune disease that in volves inflammation of the syno vium, a thin la yer of tissue lining the joint space. As the disease worsens, there is a progressiv e erosion of bone, leading to misalignment of the affected joint, loss of function, and disabilit y. Rheumatoid arthritis tends to affect the small joints of the hands and feet in a symmetric pattern, but other joint patterns are often seen. Because of its systemic pro-inflammatory state, RA can damage virtually an y extr a- articular tissue. Cardio vascular disease is considered an extr a-articular manifestation and a major predictor of poor prognosis. T raditional risk factors such as obesit y, dyslipidemia, type 2 diabetes, metabolic syndrome, h ypertension, ph ysical inactivit y, advanced age, male gender , family history of cardio vascular disease, h yperhomocysteinemia, and tobacco use ha ve been associated with cardio vascular disease in RA patients. In fact, seropositiv e RA ma y, like diabetes, act as an independent risk factor for cardio vascular disease (Sarmiento-Monro y et al. , 2012). Joint Affected by Rheumatoid Arthritis In rheumatoid arthritis, the synovium becomes inflamed, causing warmth, redness, swelling, and pain. As the disease progresses, the inflamed synovium invades and damages the cartilage and bone of the joint. Surrounding muscles, ligaments, and tendons become weakened. Rheumatoid arthritis can also cause more generalized bone loss that may lead to osteoporosis (fragile bones that are prone to fracture). Source: NIAMS, 2016. Women are nearly three times more lik ely than men to dev elop rheumatoid arthritis\u2014it can start at an y age (mean age at the onset is 40 to 60 y ears). The precise cause of rheumatoid arthritis is unknown; lik e other autoimmune diseases it arises from a v ariable combination of genetic susceptibilit y, environmental factors, and the inappropriate activation of the immune responses. Multiple genes are associated with disease susceptibilit y, with the HLA locus accounting for 30% to 50% of the o verall genetic risk (Fattahi & Mirshafiey , 2012). Despite the well-documented negativ e impact of chronic pain on qualit y of life and functional outcomes, the best w ay to measure pain in patients with RA has not been adequately studied. Most research on the measurement of pain in RA focuses on the reliabilit y of measures r ather than their utilit y in predicting the course of illness. Therefore, there is little evidence to help guide clinicians and researchers on how best to assess RA pain with a focus on treatment and interv ention in patients who are most lik ely to ha ve impaired function o ver time (Santiago et al. , 2016). Studies that explore the role of pain as a predictor of functional disabilit y typically focus on concurrent pain, or treat pain as a v ariable when examining predictors of future function. Since factors other than pain are the main predictors of interest, these studies fail to fully characteriz e the association of pain with future function and, more important, do not explore how different measures of pain and the time periods they reference ma y impact results (Santiago et al. , 2016). In the context of clinical trials for pain in gener al, the Initiative on Methods, Measurement, and Pain Assessment in Clinical Trials (IMMP ACT) recommendations outline pain intensit y as one k ey outcome measure, recommending primarily the use of a 0 to 10 numerical scale for r ating pain. R ecommendations also suggest use of a v erbal r ating scale that ma y be easier for some patients to complete (Santiago et al. , 2016). Psoriatic Arthritis Psoriatic arthritis is an inflammatory joint disease char acteriz ed by stiffness, pain, swelling, and tenderness of the joints as well as the surrounding ligaments and tendons. It affects men and women equally , typically presents at the age of 30 to 50 y ears, and is associated with psoriasis in appro ximately 25% of patients. Cutaneous disease usually precedes the onset of psoriatic arthritis b y an a verage of 10 y ears in the majorit y of patients but 14% to 21% of patients with psoriatic arthritis dev elop symptoms of arthritis prior to the development of skin disease. The presentation is v ariable and can r ange from a mild, nondestructiv e arthritis to a sev ere, debilitating, erosiv e joint disease (Llo yd et al. , 2012).Psoriatic arthritis affects fewer people in the United States than rheumatoid arthritis. It has a highly v ariable presentation, which gener ally in volves pain and inflammation in joints and progressiv e joint in volvement and damage. There are multiple clinical subsets of psoriatic arthritis: Monoarthritis of the large joints arthritis Spondyloarthritis, or a symmetrical deforming poly arthropath y similar to that of rheumatoid arthritis (Llo yd et al. , 2012) Left untreated, a proportion of patients ma y dev elop persistent inflammation with deforming progressiv e joint damage which leads to sev ere ph ysical limitation and disabilit y (Lloyd et al. , 2012). In man y patients articular patterns change or o verlap in time. Enthesitis (an inflammation of the area where tendons, ligaments, joint capsules, or fascia attach to bone) ma y occur at any site, but more commonly at the insertion sites of the plantar fascia, the Achilles tendons, and ligamentous attachments to the ribs, spine, and pelvis (Llo yd et al. , 2012). Dactylitis , an important feature of psoriatic arthritis, is a combination of enthesitis of the tendons and ligaments and syno vitis in volving all joints in the digit. The sev erity of the skin and joint disease frequently does not correlate with each other . Other manifestations of psoriatic arthritis include conjunctivitis, iritis, (Llo yd et al. , 2012). Nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs help with symptomatic relief , but they do not alter the disease course or prev ent disease progression. Intr a-articular steroid injections can be used for symptomatic relief . Physical or occupational ther apy may also be helpful in symptomatic relief (Llo yd et al. , 2012). Disease-modif ying anti-rheumatic drugs are the mainsta y of treatment for patients suffering from psoriatic arthritis. Currently , the most effectiv e class of ther apeutic agents for treating psoriatic arthritis is the TNF- inhibitors; howev er, these drugs show a 30% to 40% primary failure r ate in both r andomiz ed clinical trials and registry -based longitudinal studies (Llo yd et al. , 2012). Pain in Sp ecial PopulationsThe extremes of age, as well as specific diseases such as cancer , provide special challenges to pain care. Infants and children, older adults, people with dementia, and cancer patients have little in common ph ysiologically , but they share a propensit y tow ard under -medication for pain. There is some evidence that the under -treatment of pain in these patient populations is impro ving, but acute care clinicians should pa y particular attention to pain assessment and care in these patients (Thomas, 2013). Pain in Infants, Children, and Adolescents Although sk epticism tow ards infant pain char acteriz ed much of the twentieth century , it is now well understood that an infant 's pain tr ansmission path ways are fully dev eloped b y 22 to 24 weeks of gestation. In addition, pain inhibitory path ways are not fully dev eloped in infants, suggesting that infants ma y feel ev en more pain than older children (W axman et al., 2016). In spite of its frequency , pain in infants, children, and adolescents is often underestimated and under -treated. It has been shown that infants and children who experience pain in early life show long-term changes in terms of pain perception and related beha viors (Srouji et al., 2010). In infants, improper management of acute pain has been associated with negativ e short - and long-term consequences. Increased metabolic r ate during painful experiences has been associated with increased potential for chronic pain, dela yed wound healing, increased risk of infection, and alter ations in pain sensitivit y. Long-lasting consequences include dela ys in motor and br ain dev elopment, as well as deficits in cognition and emotional regulation (W axman et al. , 2016). In an international surv ey of pain in adolescents, almost three-quarters of adolescents experienced headache, stomachache, or backache at least monthly . These pain conditions commonly coexist and are more prev alent in girls and older adolescents. While there w as some v ariation in pain prev alence across the 28 countries surv eyed, there were no countries where these three pains were uncommon (S wain et al. , 2014). In adolescents, pain is an important predictor of future pain. A Danish twins study found adolescents with persistent low back pain were 3.5 times more lik ely to ha ve low back pain in adulthood. Co-occurrence of low back pain and headache in adolescence further increases the risk of dev eloping future pain (S wain et al. , 2014). Barriers to pain management in children are numerous and include inaccur acies regarding pathoph ysiologic mechanisms of pain, fears regarding the use of pharmacologic agents, and deficits in knowledge of pain assessment. P ersonal v alues and beliefs also prev ent adequate identification and alleviation of pain for all children (Srouji et al. , 2010). Did You Know . . . Pain management in infants and children is an example of the influence of tradition, personal bias, persistence m yths, and resistance to change. There is a substantial gap between evidence and pr actice, and some authors suggest that pediatric nursing, rooted deeply in tr adition and ritual, is particularly resistant to evidence-based pr actice changes (Susan Lacey , 2008). Chronic Pain in Children A significant percentage of children and adolescents (25%-33%) experience chronic pain, with prev alence increasing with age and occurring slightly more commonly in girls than boys. The most commonly reported locations of pain in children and adolescents are: Head Stomach Arms Legs (Carter & Threlk eld, 2012) The most common chronic pain conditions in children include: Migraine Recurrent abdominal pain Gener al musculosk eletal pain (Carter & Threlk eld, 2012) Chronic pain can interfere with dev elopmental functioning, increase lev els of emotional distress, and disrupt school attendance. P arents are also adv ersely affected and must negotiate appointments with multiple pro viders, including both primary and secondary providers. This can lead to missed school for the child, missed work for parents, and depletion of emotional and financial resources (Gorodzinsky et al. , 2012). Families often report a loss of trust in pro viders when treatment fails to address the high levels of pain their child is experiencing. P arents ma y experience frustr ation with inconclusiv e medical tests, decreasing their hopes that an y provider will be able to do anything for their child. With failure to reduce their child' s pain, parents ma y experience reduced expectations for treatment (Gorodzinsky et al. , 2012).A multidisciplinary approach using a biopsy chosocial perspectiv e to assess and treat chronic pain in children is effectiv e in reducing the pain experiences and consequences of pain. F amilies note that pro viders in multidisciplinary settings displa yed an interest in understanding the pain and increasing the comfort of the families during the appointment. Including the family' s perspectiv e during treatment is an example of collabor ative healthcare, which impro ves communication and more effectiv ely implements the plan of care (Gorodzinsky et al. , 2012). Pain in Older Adults Pain is the number one complaint of older adults and 20% report taking a painkiller regularly . Establishing the prev alence of pain in older adults has been difficult, howev er, because of v ariations in pain study par ameters and definitions (Lillie et al. , 2013). Wide variations in prev alence exist in the liter ature due to differences in the studies, including country and date of study , type of study , population studied, t ype of pain examined, pain definitions used, sites of pain examined, methods used, and time period of prev alence examined (Age and Ageing, 2013). Older adults, because of their elev ated chronic disease burden, ha ve a high risk of experiencing daily pain, and their pain experience ma y produce a wide spectrum of unwanted consequences including reduced qualit y of life, reduced engagement in social and recreational activities, and an increased risk of falls. The presence of pain also reduces the lik elihood for older adults meeting ph ysical activit y guidelines ev en when factoring in chronic health conditions. Older adults with chronic pain conditions, such as back pain, are significantly less ph ysically activ e compared with their counterparts who do not experience back pain (Ho et al. , 2016). Because of these difficulties, pain is a persistent and costly problem in older adults, r aising several potential issues associated with pain management. Ph ysiologic and cognitiv e changes, medical liter acy, low income, co-morbid conditions, and adherence affect the success of a pain management progr am. Issues w ith Pain Management in Older Adults Aging is associated with clinically important changes in pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics. Drug absorption is gener ally unchanged, but studies of drug distribution rev eal increased plasma concentr ation of w ater-soluble drugs and increased half-life of fat -soluble drugs in older adults. F or all opioids, half -life of the activ e drug and metabolites is increased in elders (Dalacorte et al. , 2011).Decline in the cognitiv e function is also an area of concern with aging adults, partly because impaired cognitiv e function can lower medication liter acy. This has been associated with a decrease in the lik elihood of reading prescription leaflets or other medication information, a reduction in medication reconciliation (agreement between physicians and patients on what medications are currently being used), patients misinterpreting dosage directions on drug labels, and failure to adhere to v erbal counseling by physicians (T aylor et al. , 2012). Older adults with low income, those without adequate prescription drug co verage, and those using high-cost medications are lik ely to stretch out their medication supply b y skipping doses or extending the interv al between doses. T aking a lower -than-prescribed dose is especially prev alent in patients taking multiple medications, those prone to medication side effects, and people who resist prescribed treatment due to personal or cultur al beliefs. In older adults with multiple co-morbid conditions, polypharmacy is common and increases the risk of adv erse drug reactions, nonadherence, and cost. Sev eral drugs used to treat pain, such as opioids, tricy clic antidepressants, gabapentin, and pregabalin, are among those associated with sedation, dizziness, and falls, particularly in fr ail or vulner able elders (Dalacorte et al. , 2011). Managing Adherence About 20% of communit y-dwelling adults aged 65 and older tak e ten or more medications daily. This is a critical issue because polypharmacy has been associated with a higher risk of non- adherence to treatment. Adherence is the extent to which a patient 's actual drug regimen\u2014dosage, time, and mode of administr ation\u2014corresponds to the prescriptions made b y the doctor . In older people, poor adherence has been reported in 26 % to 59% of cases (depending on the population considered and on the definition of adherence used), and is associated with a decline in clinical status, a greater risk of falls, hospitalization, and death, as well as an increase in health expenditures (Bilotta et al. , 2011). The main barriers to adherence in older adults are: Forgetting to tak e the drug Limited organizational skills Belief that the drug is ineffectiv e or unnecessary Cost (Bilotta et al. , 2011)Managing pain medications is a serious problem for caregiv ers, who ma y be required to manage multiple medications, ma y have difficult y keeping prescriptions filled, and ma y miss giving doses due to their work schedules. A substantial number of communit y- dwelling older adults do not recall receiving an y instructions on taking their medications and rely on family members or caregiv ers for help . In regards to pain management, following the prescribed treatment plan is important for the prev ention and control of pain. If opioids are part of the plan of care, healthcare providers should discuss an y fears related to side effects and risk of addiction. F amily members and patients must be encour aged to tell healthcare pro viders when they are experiencing pain or when the nature or lev el of pain changes. Although complete pain relief ma y not be possible, pro viders can assure patients and family members that they will work to k eep pain at a lev el that allows patients to engage in activities necessary to recover and return home. Adherence can be impro ved by providing additional tr aining for caregiv ers of older adults who are unable to tak e their medications properly . Providers can support caregiv ers by routinely reviewing their patients' medications to ensure that drug regimens are adequate, are being followed, and as simple as possible. There is evidence that better adherence can be obtained if patients and caregiv ers are engaged in decisions about starting, k eeping, or changing a medication. With fr ail older adults, their desire for in volvement is essentially fulfilled b y good communication, which does not necessarily extend to the decision-making process (Bilotta et al. , 2011). Pain in People with Dem entia Pain is a v ery common problem in people with dementia. Its prev alence is high; there is good agreement in both large and small studies that about 50% of the people with dementia regularly experience pain. This is not surprising, considering that adv anced age is an important risk factor for dev eloping pain (v an Kooten et al. , 2015). Pain in people with dementia is associated with neuropsy chiatric symptoms, declines in cognitiv e functioning, as well as declines in the performance of activities of daily living. Next to neuropsy chiatric symptoms, pain is the most cited reason for a decrease in qualit y of life in dementia. Therefore, recognition and adequate treatment of pain in people with dementia should ha ve high priorit y (van Kooten et al. , 2015). Pain in Nursing Home ResidentsBecause cognitiv e impairment is common in man y nursing home residents, assessment and management of pain can be a particularly demanding problem. Communication difficulties in people with cognitiv e decline leads to both the under -diagnosis and under - treatment of pain (Bauer et al. , 2016). There is evidence that people with adv anced cognitiv e decline receiv e pain treatment, notably opioids, less frequently or in lower insufficient doses as compared to their cognitiv ely fit counterparts. Unable to properly communicate their pain, changes in behavior run the risk of being misinterpreted as beha vioral symptoms, pro voking inappropriate prescription of antipsy chotics which, in turn, ha ve been associated with compromised cognition, falls and fr actures, and increased risk of death. There is broad consensus that the failure to accur ately identif y pain in cognitiv ely impaired individuals is the primary cause of sub-optimal management of pain (Bauer et al. , 2016). In 2009 the American Geriatric Societ y recommended a comprehensiv e, disease-specific assessment to establish adequate pain management on an individual lev el. While individuals with mild to moder ate cognitiv e impairment are often able to report pain either verbally or b y use of r ating scales, these options are not applicable for those with adv anced cognitiv e impairment when the abilit y to communicate is sev erely impaired. As a result, self-reported pain ma y not alw ays be reliable in people with adv anced cognitiv e impairment and pain should be indirectly r ated using a v alidated observ ational instrument. Various numerical and visual scales are a vailable for self -reported experience of pain, all of them lacking soundness in persons with cognitiv e impairment, due to their subjection on memory , abstr act thinking, and speech comprehension (Bauer et al. , 2016). Pain at the End of Life Pain control for cancer and palliativ e care is used when pain and symptom control is important for qualit y of life. An integr ated model of care to address the entire patient, body and mind, is the best approach. This ma y serv e as a bridge to hospice care. Oregon P ain Guidance, 2016 When a person is living with an adv anced illness or coming to the end of life, prev enting and relieving pain is often a high priorit y. Effectiv e pain management is important for man y conditions and pain is among the most debilitating and feared symptoms faced b y patients and their families. Despite this understanding, man y sev erely ill patients spend the last days of their liv es in moder ate to sev ere pain.From a pro vider perspectiv e, consistent assessment of pain is critical, as is in volving the patient and family in establishing goals for palliativ e pain management. P atients and family members should be educated about dosing, compliance, addiction, toler ance, and side effects. Good pain management at the end of life in volves listening to the patient 's subjectiv e measure of pain, properly assessing patients with cognitiv e impairment, and overcoming m yths about opioid ther apy related to fear of causing addiction or hastening death. Palliative Care Palliative care is an approach that aims to impro ve the qualit y of life of patients and their families who are facing the problems associated with life-threatening illness. This is accomplished through the prev ention and relief of suffering b y means of early identification, assessment, and treatment of pain and other issues. In 2013 the National Consensus Project (NCS) released updated guidelines for palliativ e care. The guidelines build upon and expand the definition of palliativ e care dev eloped b y the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services. The updated guidelines state, \"The goal of palliativ e care is to reliev e physical, psy chological, emotional, and spiritual suffering and distress of individuals and families (recognizing family as it is defined b y each individual). \" The main tenets of the National Consensus Project guidelines are as follows: Palliativ e care centers on the unique goals, strengths, and needs of each patient and family . An interdisciplinary team\u2014including, but not limited to , chaplains, nurses, ph ysicians, and social work ers with expertise in palliativ e care\u2014pro vides services in a collabor ative manner . The team striv es to promote continuit y of care across v arious settings and pro viders. Equitable access to palliativ e care and the a vailabilit y of palliativ e care from the time of diagnosis on ward is essential. The new guidelines are organiz ed according to the following domains: structure and processes of care; ph ysical, psy chological, and psy chiatric aspects of care; spiritual, religious, existential, and cultur al aspects of care; care of patients at the end of life; and ethical and legal aspects of care. Clinical Practice Guidelines for Quality Palliative Care (3rd edition, 2013) is a vailable at http://www .nationalconsensusproject.org. Cancer Pain at the End of LifeUnder -treatment and inequitable access to pain treatment ha ve been described among many cancer patients presenting with pain. The reported prev alence of moder ate to sev ere pain in adv anced cancer is appro ximately 64%, with a sharp increase to as high as 80% to 90% at the end of life (Gao et al. , 2014). A study ev aluating the char acteristics of patients with adv anced cancer presenting to a palliativ e care service found the primary tumor as the chief cause of pain in 68% of patients. Most pain w as somatic, and pain w as as lik ely to be continuous as intermittent (NCI, 2016). The tr aditional mainsta y of pain management since the 1980s has been the W orld Health Organization' s three-step \"ladder \" approach, in volving recommendation of a single strong opioid for moder ate to sev ere cancer pain. Increasingly o ver the treatment course, patients may be switched (sometimes called rotated ) from one opioid to another because of side effects or concerns regarding effectiv eness of the initial opioid. In addition, patients ma y be prescribed combinations of opioids, usually when they are receiving long- acting and short-acting compounds or compounds b y different routes, especially if one compound is not available in the required formulation or route (Gao et al. , 2014). Musculoskeletal Pain at the End of Life Although palliativ e care has, in the past, focused on cancer , it has recently expanded to include other conditions, including musculosk eletal pain at the end of life. P opulation-based studies indicate that musculosk eletal pain is such a common and significant issue at the end of life that musculosk eletal disease ma y have as much, if not more, effect on whether a person dies in pain than the condition that is the cause of death (Lillie et al. , 2013). Gender Differences in Pain Sensitivity Evidence suggests men and women experience and report pain differently (Horn et al. , 2014). Specifically , women ha ve been shown to ha ve a lower pain threshold and pain tolerance and stronger responses to analgesics than do men. These differences are present in communit y-dwelling and clinical samples. It is often difficult to discern whether well- documented differences in pain reports among women and men are biology based (sex) or shaped b y social and cultur al expectations (gender) (Ho et al. , 2016).Evidence suggests that differing biologic and psy chosocial factors ma y account for gender differences in pain sensitivit y. It is well-known that psy chosocial factors can influence the perception and ev aluation of pain. One commonly studied psy chosocial factor is pain- related fear , which includes fear of the sensation of pain, fear of mo vement or re-injury , and fear of ph ysical activities that are assumed to cause pain. P ain-related fear ma y contribute to the shift from acute low back pain to chronic low back pain, and numerous studies ha ve demonstr ated the association of pain-related fear with disabilit y in patients with chronic and acute low back pain, hip and knee osteoarthritis, and foot and ankle dysfunction (Horn et al. , 2014). The differences in psy chosocial factors (such as pain-related fear) ma y contribute to differences in the pain reports between men and women. Sev eral lines of research using experimentally induced pain ha ve begun to shed light on these sex differences. F or example, an experimental pain study using electrical stimuli found the increased pain experienced b y women during a mo vement task w as accounted for b y higher reports of fear among women compared to men. In addition to pain-related fear , Robinson and colleagues found women to be more willing to report pain and consider themselv es to be more sensitiv e to pain compared to males. Con versely , some males believ e that they ha ve higher pain endur ance than women and as compared to the t ypical male (Horn et al. , 2014). Clinically , gender differences are relev ant because a greater percentage of chronic pain sufferers are women. W omen also gener ally report more areas of bodily pain and more pain-related disabilit y compared to men. Giv en that pain is such a prev alent and debilitating condition with serious health and economic consequences, the Institute of Medicine has stressed the need to impro ve healthcare deliv ery of pain management, including individualiz ed treatment approaches (Horn et al. , 2014). Assessing and Documenting Pain Assessment and documentation of pain, systematically and consistently , guides the identification of pain as well as the effectiv eness of treatment. Since the goal of ther apy is to alleviate pain and impro ve function, assessment should focus on pain and functional status. The most critical aspect of pain assessment is that it be done on a regular basis using a standard format. P ain should be re- assessed after each interv ention to ev aluate the effect and determine whether interv entions should be modified. The time fr ame for re- assessment should be directed b y the needs of the patient and the hospital or unit policies and procedures.A self -report b y the patient has tr aditionally been the mainsta y of pain assessment. F amily caregiv ers can be used as pro xies for patient reports, especially in situations in which communication barriers exist, such as cognitiv e impairment or language barriers. It is important to note that family members who act as pro xies t ypically , as a group , report higher lev els of pain than patient self -reports, although there is individual v ariation. Both ph ysiologic and beha vioral responses can indicate the presence of pain and should be noted as part of a comprehensiv e assessment, particularly following surgery . Physiologic responses include tach ycardia, responses include splinting, grimacing, moaning or grunting, distorted posture, and reluctance to mo ve. A lack of ph ysiologic responses or an absence of beha viors indicating pain ma y not mean there is an absence of pain. Good documentation allows communication among clinicians about the current status of the patient 's pain and responses to the plan of care. The Joint Commission requires that pain be documented as a means of prompting clinicians to re- assess and document pain whenev er vital signs are obtained. Documentation is also used as a means of monitoring the qualit y of pain management within the institution. Pain Assessment Tools Selecting a pain assessment tool should be, when possible, a collabor ative decision between patient and pro vider to ensure that the patient is familiar with the tool. If the clinician selects the tool, consider ation should be giv en to the patient 's age; ph ysical, emotional, and cognitiv e status; and personal preferences. P atients who are alert but unable to talk ma y be able to point to a number or a face to report their pain. The pain tool selected should be used on a regular basis to assess pain and the effect of interv entions; it should not, howev er, be used as the sole measure of pain (AHRQ , 2008). Pain Scales Many pain intensit y measures ha ve been dev eloped and v alidated. Most measure only one aspect of pain (ie, pain intensit y) and most use a numeric r ating. Some tools measure both pain intensit y and pain unpleasantness and use a sliding scale that allows the patient to identif y small differences in intensit y. The following illustr ations show some commonly used pain scales. Visual Analog Scale The Visual Analog Scale. The left endpoint corresponds to \"no pain\" and the right endpoint (100) is defined as \"pain as intense as it can be.\" A 10-cm baseline is recommended for VAS scales.

Indicated for adults and children (>9 years old) in all patient care settings in which patients are able to use numbers to rate the intensity of their pain. The NRS consists of a straight horizontal line numbered at equal intervals from 0 to 10 with anchor words of \"no pain,\" \"moderate pain,\" and \"worst pain.\" Source: Adapted from Acute Pain Management Guideline Panel, 1992 (AHCPR, 1994).

The arrow at the left means \"no pain sensation\" and the arrow at the right indicates the \"most intense pain sensation imaginable.\" The sliding part of the device is moved on a different axis for the unpleasantness scale. The arrow at the left means \"not at all unpleasant\" and the arrow at the right represents pain that is the \"most unpleasant imaginable.\" Source: The Risk Communication Institute.

Some studies indicate that older adults prefer to char acteriz e their pain using the VRS. The description can be tr anslated to a number for charting (see following table) and works particularly well if ev eryone on the unit uses the same scale.Verbal Rating Scale (VRS) Description Points Assigned No pain 0 Mild pain 2 Moderate 5 Severe 10 For patients with limited cognitive ability, scales with drawings or pictures, such as the Wong-Baker FACES scale, are useful. Patients with advanced dementia may require behavioral observation to determine the presence of pain.

Pain Questionnaires Pain questionnaires typically contain verbal descriptors that help patients distinguish different kinds of pain. The McGill Pain Questionnaire, developed by Melzack in 1971, asks patients to describe subjective psychological feelings of pain. Pain descriptors such as pulsing, shooting, stabbing, burning, grueling, radiating, and agonizing (and more than seventy other descriptors) are grouped together to convey a patient's pain response. The McGill Pain Questionnaire combines a list of questions about the nature and frequency of pain with a body-map diagram to pinpoint its location. The questionnaire uses word lists separated into four classes (sensory, affective, evaluative, and miscellaneous) to assess the total pain experience. After patients are finished rating their pain words, the administrator allocates a numerical score, called the \"Pain Rating Index.\" Scores vary from 0 to 78, with the higher score indicating greater pain (Srouji et al. , 2010).The Brief P ain In ventory (BPI), dev eloped b y the W orld Health Organization, also uses the questionnaire format to measure pain. The abilit y to resume activit y, maintain a positiv e affect or mood, and sleep are relev ant functions for patients. The BPI uses a numeric r ating scale to assess difficulties with w alking, gener al activit y, mood, and sleep . Assessing Pain in Children Despite decades of research and the a vailabilit y of effectiv e analgesic approaches, man y children continue to experience moder ate to sev ere pain, especially after hospitalization. Greater research efforts are needed to identif y the factors that facilitate effectiv e pain management. Ov erall, the factors affecting children' s pain management are influenced b y cooper ation (nurses, doctors, parents, and children), child (beha vior, diagnosis, and age), organization (lack of routine instructions for pain relief , lack of time, and lack of pain clinics), and nurses (experience, knowledge, and attitude) (Aziznejadroshan et al, 2016). Pain ev aluation in small children can be a difficult task, since it is a multidimensional experience that possesses sensory and affectiv e components often hard to discriminate b y the existing scores. Previous experiences, fear , anxiet y, and discomfort ma y alter pain perception; thus, poor agreement between instruments and r aters is often the norm. It has been suggested that, in children y ounger than 7 y ears of age and in cognitiv ely impaired children, ev aluation of pain intensit y through self -report instruments can be inaccur ate due to poor understanding of the instrument and poor capacit y to tr anslate the painful experience into v erbal language; therefore, complementary observ ational pain measurements should be used to assess pain intensit y (Kolosovas-Machuca et al. , 2016). Three methods are commonly used to measure a child' s pain intensit y: Self-reporting : what a child is sa ying, using age- appropriate numeric scales, pictorial scales, or v erbal scales.1. Behavioral measures : what a child is doing using motor response, beha vioral responses, facial expression, crying, sleep patterns, decreased activit y or eating, body postures, and mo vements. These are more frequently used with neonates, infants, and y ounger children where communication is difficult.2. Physiologic measures : how the body is reacting using changes in heartr ate, blood pressure, o xygen satur ation, palmar ation, and sometimes neuroendocrine responses. They are gener ally used in combination with behavioral and self -report measures, as they are usually v alid for short -duration acute pain and differ with the gener al health and matur ational age of the infant or child. In addition, similar ph ysiologic responses also occur during stress,3.Children' s capabilit y to describe pain increases with age and experience, and changes throughout their dev elopmental stages. Although observ ed reports of pain and distress provide helpful information, particularly for y ounger children, they are reliant on the individuals completing the report (Srouji et al. , 2010). Assessing Pain in Infants The major challenge with infant pain assessment is that neonates cannot self -report their subjectiv e experience of pain. Moreo ver, there is a lack of agreement on the best pro xy modalit y of assessing infant pain, whether it is cortical, biochemical, ph ysiologic, or behavioral. Recent work has suggested discordance not only among modalities, but also within an assessment modalit y. For example, the v alidity and reliabilit y of ph ysiologic measures of infant pain are presently disputed because these measures are influenced b y additional v ariables that ha ve not been properly tak en into account (eg, infection and respir atory r ate) (W axman et al. , 2016). Cardio-ph ysiologic indices of pain, such as heart r ate and heart r ate variabilit y, are pervasive in the hospital setting. R ecently , a group of Canadian researchers look ed at the development of cardio vascular responses to acutely painful medical procedures o ver the first y ear of life in both preterm and term-born infants. R esearchers noted the following: Extremely pre-term infants (born at less than 28 weeks gestational age) displa yed a blunted heart r ate response to acute pain in the first week of life. In infants born between 28 and less than 32 weeks gestational age, mean heart r ate was found to significantly increase following an acutely painful procedure from birth to four months of age. In infants born at 32 to less than 37 weeks gestational age, mean heart r ate w as found to increase in response to acute pain during the first postnatal week of life; howev er, the magnitude of responses w as variable. During the first four postnatal months of life, full-term infants displa yed an increase in mean heart r ate in response to acute pain; howev er, the magnitude of responses w as variable (W axman et al. , 2016).which results in difficult y distinguishing stress v ersus pain responses (Srouji et al., 2010).The most common pain measures used for infants are beha vioral. These measures include crying, facial expressions, body posture, and mo vements. The qualit y of these beha viors depends on the infant 's gestational age and maturit y. Preterm or acutely ill infants, for example, do not elicit similar responses to pain due to illness and lack of energy . Interpretation of crying in infants is especially difficult, as it ma y indicate gener al distress rather than pain. Cry char acteristics are also not good indicators in preterm or acutely ill infants, as it is difficult for them to produce a robust cry (Srouji et al. , 2010). Assessing Pain in Toddlers In toddlers, v erbal skills remain limited and quite inconsistent. P ain-related beha viors are still the main indicator for assessments in this age group . Non verbal beha viors such as facial expression, limb mo vement, gr asping, holding, and crying are considered more reliable and objectiv e measures of pain than self -reports. Most children of this age are capable of v oluntarily producing displa ys of distress, with older children displa ying fewer pain beha viors (ie, they cry , moan, and groan less often) (Srouji et al. , 2010). Most 2- year-old children can report the incidence and location of pain, but do not ha ve the adequate cognitiv e skills to describe its sev erity. Three- year-old children, howev er, can start to differentiate the sev erity of pain, and are able to use a three-lev el pain intensit y scale with simple terms lik e \"no pain, \" \"little pain\" or \"a lot. \" Children in this age group are usually able to participate in simple dialogue and state whether they feel pain and \"how bad it is\" (Srouji et al. , 2010). Assessing Pain in Preschoolers By the age of four y ears, most children are usually able to use 4- to 5-item pain discrimination scales. Their abilit y to recogniz e the influence of pain appears around the age of fiv e years, when they are able to r ate the intensit y of pain. F acial expression scales are most commonly used with this age group to obtain self -reports of pain. These scales require children to point to the face that represents how they feel or the amount of pain they are experiencing (Srouji et al. , 2010). Assessing Pain in School-Aged Children Healthcare professionals depend more comfortably on self -reports from school- aged children. Although children at this age understand pain, their use of language to report it is different from adults. A t roughly 7 to 8 y ears of age children begin to understand the qualit y of pain. Self -report, visual analog, and numerical scales are effectiv e in this age group . A few pain questionnaires ha ve also pro ven effectiv e for this age (eg, pediatric pain questionnaire, adolescent pediatric pain tool) (Srouji et al. , 2010).Assessing Pain in Adolescen ts Adolescents tend to minimiz e or den y pain, especially in front of friends, so it is important to pro vide them with priv acy and choice. F or example, they ma y or ma y not choose to have parents present. They expect dev elopmentally appropriate information about procedures and accompan ying sensations. Some adolescents regress in beha vior under stress. They also need to feel able to accept or refuse str ategies and medications to mak e procedures more toler able. T o assess pain, specifically chronic pain, the adolescent pediatric pain tool (APPT) or the McGill pain questionnaire are helpful (Srouji et al. , 2010). Assessing Pain in Cognitively Intact Adults For the cognitiv ely intact adult, assessment of pain intensit y in the clinical setting is most often done b y using the 0 to 10 numeric r ating scale or the 0 to 5 W ong-Bak er Faces scale, or the VRS . Once patients know how to use a pain intensit y scale, they should establish \"comfort -function\" goals. With the clinician' s input, patients can determine the pain intensit y at which they are easily able to perform necessary activities with the fewest side effects. The American Geriatrics Societ y (AGS) and the British Geriatrics Societ y have issued guidelines for the management of pain in older adults, which begins with an accur ate assessment and includes the impact of pain on the patient 's daily activities. When analgesic treatment and pain-modulating drugs are used, co-morbidities and other risk factors must be carefully considered. The least in vasive method of administr ation should be used\u2014in most cases the or al route is preferred (Age and Ageing, 2013). Assessing Pain in Cognitively Impaired Adults The assessment of pain in patients with cognitiv e impairment is a significant challenge. Cognitiv ely impaired patients tend to v oice fewer pain complaints but ma y become agitated or manifest unusual or sudden changes in beha vior when they are in pain. Caregiv ers ma y have difficult y knowing when these patients are in pain and when they are experiencing pain relief . This mak es the patient vulner able to both under -treatment and o ver-treatment. In the absence of accur ate self -report it has been necessary to dev elop observ ational tools to be used in both research and pr actice, based on the interpretation of beha vioral cues to assess the presence of pain. This approach has resulted in a prolifer ation of pain assessment instruments dev eloped to identif y beha vioral indicators of pain in people with dementia and other cognitiv e impairment (Lichtner et al. , 2014). The most structured observ ational tools are based on guidance published b y the American Geriatrics Societ y, which describe six domains for pain assessment in older adults:In people with dementia, the interpretation of these beha viors can be complex due to overlap with other common beha vioral symptoms or cognitiv e deficits such as boredom, hunger , anxiet y, depression, or disorientation. This increases the complexit y of accur ately identif ying the presence of pain in patients with dementia and r aises questions about the validity of existing instruments (Lichtner et al. , 2014). As a result, there is no clear guidance for clinicians and care staff on the effectiv e assessment of pain, nor how this should inform treatment and care decision-making. A large number of systematic reviews ha ve been published, which analyz e the relativ e value and strength of evidence of existing pain tools. There is a need for guidance on the best evidence a vailable and for an o verall comprehensiv e synthesis (Lichtner et al. , 2014). In a systematic review of reliabilit y, validity, feasibilit y and clinical utilit y of 28 pain assessment tools used with older adults with dementia, no one tool appeared to be more reliable and v alid than the others (Lichtner et al. , 2014). P atient self -report remains the gold standard for pain assessment but in non- verbal older adults the next best option, from a user -centered perspectiv e, becomes the assessment of a person who is most familiar with the patient in their ev eryday life in a hospital or other care setting; this is sometimes referred to as a \"silv er standard\" (Lichtner et al. , 2014). A thorough review of pain assessment tools for non verbal older adults b y Herr , Bursch, and Black of The Univ ersity of Iow a is available here . Keeping these challenges in mind, three commonly used beha vioral assessment tools are examples of tools that are used in assessing pain and ev aluating interv entions in cognitiv ely impaired adults. Behavioral Pain Scale The Beha vioral Pain Scale (BPS) w as dev eloped for use with critically ill patients in the ICU . It evaluates and scores three categories of beha vior on a 1 to 4 scale:Facial expression 1. Negativ e vocalization 2. Body language3. Changes in activit y patterns 4. Changes in interpersonal inter actions 5. Mental status changes (Lichtner et al. , 2014) 6. Facial expression: 1 for relax ed to 4 for grimacing 1. Upper -limb mo vement: 1 for no mo vement to 4 for permanently retr acted 2.A cumulativ e score abo ve 3 ma y indicate pain is present; the score can be used to ev aluate interv ention, but cannot be interpreted to mean pain intensit y. The patient must be able to respond in all categories of beha vior\u2014for example, the BPS should not be used in a patient who is receiving a neuromuscular blocking agent. Pain Assessm ent differ from pain vior scales in that they do not ev aluate the degree of an observ ed beha vior and do not require a patient to demonstr ate all of the behaviors specified, although the patient must be responsiv e enough to demonstr ate some of the beha viors. These checklists are useful in identif ying a patient 's \"pain signature\"\u2014the pain beha viors unique to that individual. The Pain Assessment Checklist for Seniors with Limited Ability to Communicate (PACSLAC) is a caregiv er-administered tool that into four subscales: checkmark is made next to an y beha vior the patient exhibits. The total number of behaviors ma y be scored but cannot be equated with a pain intensit y score. It is unknown if a high score represents more pain than a low score. In other words, a patient who scores 10 out of 60 beha viors does not necessarily ha ve less pain than a patient who scores 20. Howev er, in an individual patient, a change in the total pain score ma y suggest more or less pain. Advanced Dem entia Scale (PAINAD) The Pain Assessment in Advanced Dementia Scale (PAINAD) w as dev eloped to pro vide a clinically relev ant and easy -to-use observ ational pain assessment tool for individuals with advanced dementia. The aim of the tool dev elopers w as to \"dev elop a tool for measuring pain in non-communicativ e individuals that would be simple to administer and had a score from 0 to 10\" (Herr , et al. , 2008). This tool is used when sev ere dementia is present. This tool in volves the assessment of breathing, negativ e vocalization, facial expression, body language, and consolabilit y. Ventilator compliance: 1 for toler ating v entilator to 4 for unable to control ventilation3. Facial expressions (13 items) 1. Activit y/body mo vements (20 items) 2.

Public domain.Total: Clinical Assessment of Cancer PainPain assessment in patients with pain secondary to cancer begins with a thorough discussion of the patient 's goals and expectations for pain management, including balancing pain lev els and other patient goals, such as mental alertness. Comprehensiv e pain assessment also includes pain history , pain intensit y, qualit y of pain, and location of pain. F or each pain location, the pattern of pain r adiation should be assessed (NCI, 2016). A review of the patient 's current pain management plan and how he or she has responded to treatment is important. This includes how well the current treatment plan addresses breakthrough or episodic pain. A full assessment also reviews previously attempted pain therapies and reasons for discontinuation; other associated symptoms such as sleep difficulties, fatigue, depression, and anxiet y; functional impairment; and an y relev ant laboratory data and diagnostic imaging. A focused ph ysical examination includes clinical observ ation of pain beha viors, pain location, and functional limitations (NCI, 2016). Psychosocial and existential factors that can affect pain must also be assessed and treated. Depression and anxiet y in particular can strongly influence the pain experience. Across many different t ypes of pain, research has shown the importance of considering a patient 's sense of self -efficacy o ver their pain: low self -efficacy , or focus on solely pharmacologic solutions, is lik ely to increase the use of pain medication (NCI, 2016). Patients who catastrophiz e pain (eg, patient reports pain higher than 10 on a 10-point scale) are more lik ely to require higher doses of pain medication than are patients who do not catastrophiz e. Catastrophizing is strongly associated with low self -efficacy and reliance on chemical coping str ategies. Assessing the impact of pain on the individual' s life and associated factors that exacerbate or reliev e pain can rev eal how psy chosocial issues are affecting the patient 's pain lev els (NCI, 2016). A number of factors can help a pro vider predict response to pain treatment in a cancer patient. Specifically , a high baseline pain intensit y, neuropathic pain, and incident pain are often more difficult to manage. Certain patient char acteristics such as a personal or family history of illicit drug use, alcoholism, smoking, somatization, mental health issues such as depression or anxiet y, and cognitiv e dysfunction are associated with higher pain expression, higher opioid doses, and longer time to achiev e pain control (NCI, 2016). Several risk -assessment tools ha ve been dev eloped to assist clinicians, such as the Edmonton Classification S ystem for Cancer P ain (ECS-CP) and the Cancer P ain Prognostic Scale (CPPS) (NCI, 2016).The ECS-CP considers (1) neuropathic pain, (2) incident pain, (3) psy chological distress, (4) addiction, and (5) cognitiv e impairment. The presence of an y of these factors indicates that pain ma y be more difficult to control. The ECS-CP has been v alidated in v arious cancer pain settings. The CPPS (NCI, 2016) considers four v ariables in a formula to determine the risk score: CPPS scores r ange from 0 to 17, with a higher score indicating a higher possibilit y of pain relief (NCI, 2016). Psychosocial Aspects of Pain Management Pain perception \u2014the conscious recognition and a wareness of a painful stimulus\u2014is modulated and modified b y man y psy chological and personalit y-related factors. These can include previous pain experiences, emotions and cognition, somatization and catastrophizing, the presence of acute and chronic stressful life ev ents, fatigue, anxiet y, fear, boredom, and anticipation of more pain. P ain perception is also influenced b y socioeconomic factors such as social support, acceptance, incentiv es, education, occupation, and qualit y of life. In addition, pain perception differs among genders and ethnicities, and v aries with age (Belfer , 2013). Chronic pain in particular carries with it personal and economic costs and psy chological distress, and psy chological factors pla y a significant role in chronic pain. Pre-existing depression, anxiet y, and stress ma y predispose some individuals to progress to a chronic pain condition, while chronic pain in turn leads to anxiet y and depression, creating a vicious cy cle (Rice et al. , 2016). Because of the cognitiv e, emotional, and psy chological effects that ma y be associated with pain, a biopsy chosocial concept of pain has emerged o ver the past two to three decades, along with consider able evidence supporting management approaches that address the psychosocial aspects of a patient with chronic pain (Sessle, 2012).Worst pain sev erity (Brief P ain In ventory) 1. Functional Assessment of Cancer Ther Mixed pain syndrome 4.Within the biopsy chosocial model, research on beliefs shows that negativ e pain beliefs have a detrimental impact on patients' o verall health, self -efficacy , and function. Thoughts can positively influence beliefs about the pain experience if there is control in managing the pain, confidence that potential harm and possible disabilit y are not threatened, and there are expectations of reco very. Thoughts can negatively influence beliefs about the pain experience if control is lacking and reco very is not possible. The consequence can be emotional distress and catastrophizing, as well as ex cessiv ely negativ e and pessimistic beliefs and thoughts about pain (P ons et al. , 2012). Beliefs that contribute to poor compliance, motiv ation, and misunderstanding about pain include catastrophizing, limited control o ver the pain, and emotional distress. Catastrophizing is associated with persistent pain and it is a predictor of poor outcomes in pain interv entions. Although catastrophizing and emotional distress ha ve common characteristics, it is difficult to separ ate their o verall effect (P ons et al. , 2012). Chronic Pain and Depression It has been estimated that 35% of the chronic pain population has comorbid (associated) depression (Bromley Milton et al. , 2013). P ain can be a symptom, a cause, or a consequence of depression. Studies in vestigating the association between pain and depression suggest that the stress of living with chronic pain can cause depression, but there is also evidence that pain dev elops secondary to depression, manifesting as increased pain sensitivit y, and that high depression scores are associated with greater risk of dev eloping chronic pain (Schneider et al. , 2011). The association between depression and pain appears to increase with the sev erity of each condition (Bromley Milton et al. , 2013). Failure to treat pain in depressed patients ma y adv ersely impact depression treatment outcomes. R ecognizing and optimizing the management of pain ma y be important in enhancing depression remission r ates. The presence of sev ere pain at the start of depression treatment has been seen in those who failed to respond to antidepressants, and a lower o verall pain sev erity score at the outset was associated with higher odds of achieving remission (Schneider et al. , 2011).In a systematic review of studies looking at the psy chological factors associated with knee pain, researchers found strong evidence for a positiv e association between depression and knee pain in adults. The emerging evidence on pathogenesis of depression suggests that it is associated with dysfunction in the inflammatory cytokine production as a response to stressors, dysregulation of the autonomic nerv ous system, and destabilizing effect on hypothalamic -pituitary -adrenal axis. Each of these mechanisms also contributes to the development of chronic pain syndrome. These findings indicate that ph ysiologic similarities exist between depression and chronic pain (Ph yomaung et al. , 2014). Another explanation for the association between depression and knee pain ma y be reduced physical activit y, which could be due to fear of pain or as a consequence of depression. The muscle w asting and reduced joint stabilit y resulting from low activit y may have a negativ e effect on function and the disease outcomes of osteoarthritis (Ph yomaung et al. , 2014). Extensiv e data support the v alue of tricy clic antidepressants for the alleviation of pain in chronic pain patients, and the newer serotonin and nor adrenaline reuptak e inhibitors (SNRIs)\u2014dulo xetine, v enlafaxine, and milnacipr an\u2014ha ve shown to be usseful in the treatment of pain and depression. Dulo xetine is a SNRI with pro ven efficacy for painful physical symptoms of depression. Analyses from short -term trials demonstr ated that a greater reduction in pain w as associated with a higher probabilit y of remission. Furthermore, the efficacy of dulo xetine has been pro ven for the treatment of painful diabetic neuropath y (Schneider et al. , 2011). Chronic Pain and Anxiety Anxiet y is common in chronic pain patients and anxious patients ma y interpret pain as being more intense than non- anxious patients. The presence of chronic pain mak es it difficult to recogniz e and treat potential psy chiatric disorders, and this dela y may worsen the prognosis of psy chiatric disorders (Mangerud et al. , 2013). In a cross-sectional study of Norwegian adolescents with psy chiatric disorders, two-thirds reported chronic pain. Adolescents with mood or anxiet y disorders had a significantly higher frequency of chronic pain and pain-related disabilit y than those with h yperkinetic disorders. Adolescents with h yperkinetic and mood or anxiet y disorders had a two- to three-fold increased risk of pain-related disabilit y compared to those with h yperkinetic disorders alone (Mangerud et al. , 2013).Research has shown a link between low back pain and psy chological factors, particularly depression and anxiet y. In relation to low back pain, depression is often described as being atypical and tak es the form of a so-called mask ed depression, often following a tr aumatic event. Individual psy chological interv ention is recommended as the primary treatment, with medical treatment secondary (Ellegaard & P eterson, 2012). Stress Stress is the ph ysiologic reaction that occurs in animals and people due to threatened or actual damage to the organism, including psy chological challenges at the limits of the individual' s coping capacit y. Stress-inducing factors are collectiv ely called stressors (Ellegaard & P eterson, 2012). A study showed that in psy chother apeutic treatment of patients with chronic nonspecific low back pain and moder ate depression, div erse psy chological stressors were identified, relating to both the past and present. The study found that when pain, stress, and depression become o verwhelming and there are few resources a vailable, stress seems to become prominent. Stressful situations can lower a person' s abilit y to cope with back pain (Ellegaard & P eterson, 2012). Non-Opioid and Adjuvant Analgesics A wide v ariety of non-opioid analgesics are a vailable for the treatment and management of pain. Each has a unique profile and differs in onset, peak action, dur ation of action, and side effects. A multimodal approach (balanced analgesia), which includes non-opioids, adjuv ant medications, and opioids, is recommended. Non-Opioid Analgesic Agents The appropriate use of analgesics\u2014the right drug at the right interv al\u2014pro vides good pain relief for the majorit y of patients. There are doz ens, ev en scores, of drugs that can be used depending on the clinical circumstances. F or patients needing \"broadly effectiv e analgesia, \" non-opioid approaches ma y offer o verall safet y and efficacy as compared to opioid analgesics. R ather than immediately mo ving to opioids, a clinician should consider whether non-opioid approaches ma y be appropriate (Thomas, 2013). Nonsteroidal Anti-Inflammatories A multitude of reports ha ve delineated the risks of using nonsteroidal anti- inflammatory drugs but ha ve not been totally congruent. Meta- analyses of randomiz ed controlled trials sometimes concur regarding gastrointestinal risk and cardio vascular risk but r arely report a balance of these risks for an y one drug. Benefits measured in these studies are usually not reported. Observ ational data sets, supposedly reflectiv e of \"real world\" patients, do not always agree with the r andomiz ed controlled trial reports. Clinicians need assessments measuring the balance of harms and benefits so that better decisions based on their patients' unique risk factors can be reached. Lee S . Simon, 2015 Non-steroidal Anti-inflammatory Drugs and Their Benefits and Harms Nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NS AIDs) are medications with anti-inflammatory , analgesic, and antip yretic properties; they are among the most widely used drugs in the world. They are used to reduce short - and long-term pain, decrease stiffness, and impro ve function in patients with acute and chronic conditions such as arthritis, headache, dysmenorrhea, and post oper ative pain. Aspirin, the first NS AID, was dev eloped in 1897. NSAIDs (non-selectiv semi-selectiv e NSAIDs), are most commonly prescribed to reliev e pain and inflammation. They work b y inhibiting cy clooxygenase (CO X) enzymes from making prostaglandins, some of which cause pain and inflammation. Because certain prostaglandins protect the stomach lining from the stomach acid that helps to digest food, NS AIDs can cause gastrointestinal (GI) complications. A history of prior gastrointestinal symptoms or bleeding, the presence of other risk factors such as adv ancing age, higher doses of NS AID, duration of NS AID use, and the fr ailty of the patient all increase the risk for upper GI damage and consequent bleeding (Simon, 2013). NSAIDs can be classified according to their mechanism of action: Non-selective NSAIDs like ibuprofen and napro xen inhibit both CO such as inhibit COX-2 enzymes. affinit y for CO X-2 but tend to inhibit the CO X-1 path way also (Ghosh et al. , 2015). CO X selectivit y is one of the determining factors to consider when giving NS AIDs to a patient. A meta- analysis of more than 700 studies in volving the use of certain NS AIDs for pain w as conducted b y the The Co xib and T raditional NS AID T rialists' (CNT) Collabor ation. Researchers look ed at the risk major v ascular ev ents, major cardiac ev ents, and upper GI complications from high-dose, long-term use of certain NS AIDs. Concerns about the possible heart risks of NS AIDs, man y of which ha ve been on the mark et for sev eral decades, arose after r andomiz ed trials showed that co xibs increased the risk of heart attacks (MRC, 2013). Diclofenac (V oltaren) is the agent currently in use that is most associated with an increased risk of cardio vascular ev ents: a 40% to 60% serious cardio vascular ev ents, compared to non-use of NS AIDs, has been reported. This is a r ate equiv alent to or possibly higher than that of rofeco xib (Vio xx), now withdr awn from the market (McGettigan & Henry , 2013). In contr ast, another tr aditional NS AID, napro xen, has been found to be relativ ely benign, with a cardio vascular risk that w as observ ed to be neutr al or much lower than that of diclofenac (McGettigan & Henry , 2013). The CNT Collabor ation report indicated that napro xen might be safer for patients with cardio vascular risk but that it is one of the worst NSAIDs in terms of risk for a major GI complication (Simon, 2015). Regardless of their mechanism of action, prolonged exposure to an y class of NS AIDs has been shown to ha ve potential adv erse cardio vascular effects in patients with or without pre-existing cardio vascular conditions, depending on the dur ation and dosage of these drugs. P atients with pre-existing cardio vascular conditions such as coronary artery disease, hypertension, and history of strok e are at the greatest risk of cardio vascular ev ents after taking NS AIDs. P atients who ha ve recently had cardio vascular b ypass surgery are advised not to tak e NSAIDs due to a high risk of heart attacks (Ghosh et al. , 2015). NSAID guidelines ha ve been established to increase ph ysician a wareness of the complications associated with NS AID use; howev er, some ph ysicians either do not recogniz e or do not adhere to such guidelines (T aylor et al. , 2012). A recent surv ey of physicians identified six major barriers that affected their use of established NS AID guidelines: Lack of familiarit y with the guidelines 1. Perceiv ed limited v alidity of the guidelines 2.Acetaminophen Acetaminophen, the activ e ingredient in T ylenol, is also known as par acetamol and N- acetyl-p-aminophenol (AP AP), and has been mark eted in the United States as an O TC antipyretic and analgesic agent since 1953. It is widely a vailable in a v ariety of strengths and formulations for children and adults as a single-ingredient product. Although acetaminophen has been in clinical use for decades, its mechanism of action is not fully understood. It is thought to inhibit cy clooxygenases both centr ally and peripher ally. Researchers ha ve suggested that the inhibition of cy clooxygenase in the br ain is responsible for the antip yretic effect of acetaminophen, suggesting a centr al mechanism of action. Some ha ve suggested classif ying acetaminophen as an atypical NSAID (Cha vez et al., 2015). At the same time, research has been conducted showing that acetaminophen is a prodrug,* and indicating that the analgesic effect of acetaminophen arises from the indirect activ ation of cannabinoid CB receptors. Acetaminophen also has an effect on the descending serotonergic path way, and ma y inter act with opioidergic** systems or nitric oxide path ways\u2014and also ma y act as a selectiv e COX-2 inhibitor in humans (Cha vez et al. , 2015). *Prodrug. A prodrug is a medication or compound that, after administration, is metabolized into a pharmacologically active drug (Wikipedia, 2016). **Opioidergic. An opioidergic agent is a chemical that functions to directly modulate the opioid neuropeptide systems (i.e., endorphin, enkephalin, dynorphin, nociceptin) in the body or brain. Acetaminophen is used in combination with man y prescription opioid drugs (Vicodin, Percocet) to giv e more pain relief while minimizing the dose of the addictiv e narcotic component. It is gener ally considered safe at recommended doses, but if more is tak en\u2014 even just a little more\u2014it can cause serious and ev en fatal liv er damage. In fact, acetaminophen poisoning is a leading cause of liv er failure in the United States (Hodgman & Garr ard, 2012).Limited applicabilit y of the guidelines to specific patient populations 3. Clinical inertia4. Anecdotal experiences5. Clinical heuristics (experience-based problem solving, learning b y trial and error rather that following a pre-established formula) (T aylor et al. , 2012)6. 1In the United States, acetaminophen is a vailable as 325 mg and 500 mg prepar ations and as a 650 mg extended-release medication intended for arthritis treatment. It is a vailable in drops, capsules, and pills, as well as v arious children' s dissolv able, chew able, and liquid formulations. T o reduce the risk of accidental o verdose, in 2014 the FDA announced that medications containing a combination of acetaminophen and an opioid can no longer contain more than 325 mg of acetaminophen per tablet or capsule. Video (1:53) Prescription Acetaminophen/Opioid Combinations: Making Pain Medicines Safer (2014) https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gOuSYNuXHRk Although acetaminophen is effectiv e as an antip yretic and analgesic, its anti-inflammatory properties are much weak er than those of aspirin and other NS AIDs. It is therefore less effectiv e for chronic inflammatory pain conditions such as rheumatoid arthritis. Acetaminophen is, howev er, a good choice for osteoarthritis, especially in those patients where aspirin is contr aindicated. Acetaminophen lacks the antithrombotic, blood-thinning properties of aspirin and other NS AIDS and therefore does not inhibit coagulation, an important consider ation for pain ther apy following minor surgical or dental procedures. From both a GI and cardio vascular perspectiv e, acetaminophen ma y not be as safe as previously believ ed\u2014especially at doses higher than 3 g daily . Indeed, a nested case- control study found that use of acetaminophen (an y dose) is associated with a small but significant risk of upper GI complications. In addition, although women from the Nurses' Health Study , who reported occasional use of acetaminophen, did not experience a significant increase in the risk of cardio vascular ev ents, those who reported a frequent use (6-14 tablets/week) had a small increased risk (Scarpignato Prescription Acetaminophen/Opioid Combinations: MPrescription Acetaminophen/Opioid Combinations: M ......Regular acetaminophen has also been associated with an increased risk of h ypertension both in women and men. A t doses of 3 g daily , acetaminophen induces a significant increase in ambulatory blood pressure in patients with coronary artery disease. These findings are not surprising in the light of the recent disco very that acetaminophen is indeed a selectiv e cyclooxygenase (CO X)-2 inhibitor in humans (Scarpignato et al. , 2015). Acetaminophen has been associated with a risk of r are but serious skin reactions. These skin reactions, known as Stev ens-Johnson syndrome, to exanthematous pustulosis , can be fatal. These reactions can occur with first - time use of acetaminophen or at an y time while it is being tak en. Other drugs used to treat fever, pain, and body aches (eg, NS AIDS, such as ibuprofen and napro xen) also carry the risk of causing serious skin reactions, which is already described in the w arnings section of their drug labels (FDA, 2013b). Because the risks of acetaminophen-related liv er damage are so serious and because the public is often una ware of these risks, the National Council for Prescription Drug Progr ams, the FDA 's Safe Use Initiativ e, and other stak eholders met in 2011 to form the Acetaminophen Best Pr actices T ask Group . The T ask Group recommendations, updated in 2013, are intended to mak e it easier for consumers to identif y whether a prescription pain reliev er contains acetaminophen, to compare activ e ingredients on labels, and to tak e action to a void taking two medicines with acetaminophen. The T ask Group recommended coordinating prescription container labeling with the labeling that already exists for O TC medicines, pro viding consistency in labeling across all acetaminophen-containing medicines (FDA, 2013a). Use of NSAI Ds and Acetaminophen in Older Adults Nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs ha ve been a mainsta y for chronic pain management for man y years but should be used with caution in older adults (Age and Ageing, 2013). Adverse reactions associated with NS AIDs including GI, cardio vascular , renal, and hematologic side effects, ha ve been known for a long time. Introduction of new drugs into the mark etplace and the continual stream of new research data ha ve recently called into question the use and prescribing guidelines of NS AIDs in elders, especially \"complex\" older patients (T aylor et al. , 2012). Prescribing NS AIDs to older adults requires knowledge of individual patient risk factors, benefits and risks of the NS AID, and patient education. Monitoring for effectiv eness and side effects is essential. A recent report demonstr ated that more than 50% of patients were not properly informed b y a ph ysician or pharmacist on the side effects associated with prescribed or O TC NSAIDs (T aylor et al. , 2012).For older adults, acetaminophen is the first -line treatment for both acute and persistent pain, particular musculosk eletal pain. Acetaminophen has a good safet y and efficacy profile as long as the maximum daily dose of 4g/24h is not ex ceeded (Age and Ageing, 2013). Nitrous Oxide (NO) Based upon the recent liter ature, N O ma y be poised for something of a comeback in the acute care setting. The agent is well known, self -administered, safe, and at least moder ately effectiv e. It a voids the need for IV access and has a v ery low risk of side effects. It is ex creted unchanged b y the lungs so there are no issues with renal or hepatic disease. When the tr aining, technical, and related ph ysical barriers (eg, external v enting) to NO use in the ED can be o vercome, it mak es sense for an ED to ha ve this inhaled agent available for analgesia and also as an adjunct for procedur al sedation (Thomas, 2013). As an inhaled, r apid-onset short -acting analgesic in doses used in acute care (gener ally 50:50 with o xygen but sometimes at higher concentr ations for cities at higher altitudes), NO has been in effectiv e use in the prehospital and ED settings for man y decades. Its onset and offset times of roughly 3 to 5 minutes contribute to N O's potential utilit y in the acute care en vironment. The gas has been reported useful for analgesia for acute conditions r anging from procedures to acute intensely painful conditions in which traditional analgesia is difficult (Thomas, 2013). Medical Cannabis Cannabis has an unriv aled history of continuous cultiv ation, ha ving started in Neolithic China more than 6000 y ears ago . A thorough scientific ev aluation of the medical use of cannabis goes back to the work of Sir William B . O'Shaughnessy in 1838-1840. Since then cannabis has been intensiv ely in vestigated. In the early 1960s cannabidiol (CBD) the most psy choactiv e cannabinoid delta-9-tetr ahydrocannabinol (THC) were identified. By 2009 more than 525 constituents ha ve been identified, among them about a hundred different cannabinoids (Lanz et al. , 2016). In addition to THC, other cannabinoids (and non-cannabinoids, such as terpenoids*) lik ely contribute to and modulate the o verall pharmacologic effects of cannabis. Numerous recent studies ha ve proven the anti-inflammatory and neuroprotectiv e properties of THC and CBD . Cannabidiol is known to reduce the psy chotropic effects of THC; in addition, THC and CBD (Lanz et al. , 2016). *Terpenoid: a terpene is a hydrocarbon found in the essential oils of many plants, especially conifers and citrus trees. Terpenes are also found in cannabis plants; terpenoids are formed when cannabis is dried and cured. Terpenes are non-cannabinoids and are responsible for the distinctive smell of cannabis.2 2 2 2 2There is growing evidence that the cannabinoid receptor system pla ys a centr al role in the regulation of man y key functions to maintain homeostasis. T etrahydrocannabinol, which is a partial agonist to CB receptors and to a smaller extent to CB receptors, is a vailable in many countries for sev eral indications. It is administered or ally to treat pain, nausea, spasticit y, and loss of appetite. It has pro ven to be effectiv e in patients suffering from cancer , multiple sclerosis, am yotrophic later al sclerosis, chronic pain, and other diseases (Lanz et al. , 2016). All animals ex cept insects ha ve an endogenous (made within the body) cannabinoid system, or endocannabinoid system (ECS). It has been found that humans mak e cannabinoids, similar in structure to those of the cannabis plant; further , humans ha ve receptors for these molecules. This newly disco vered molecular signaling system is essential for life and helps k eep us in balance as we deal with daily stressors (Mathre, 2016). Cannabinoid receptors in the human br ain were first identified in 1988 b y American researcher Allyn Howlett and her gr aduate student William Dev ane. They named these receptors cannabinoid 1 (CB ) receptors. In 1992 researchers in disco vered endogenous cannabinoid neurotr ansmitter , which they called anandamide. By 1993 another group of scientists found cannabinoid receptors in the immune system (CB ). To date fiv e endocannabinoids ha ve been disco vered. The CB receptors are found mainly on neurons in the br ain, spinal cord, and peripher al nervous system, but are also present in other organs and tissues. The low number of CB receptors in the br ain stem ma y help explain the absence of cannabis o verdoses due to the depression of respir ations. CB receptors are primarily found in immune cells, among them leukocytes, the spleen, and tonsils. The effectiv eness of cannabis in decreasing pain is thought to be related to the role of the CB cannabinoid receptor , which suppresses microglial cell activ ation and decreases neuro- inflammation. In addition, cannabinoid receptors ma y couple to other effectors that are critical for the tr ansmission of pain signals (Gadotti et al. , 2013). Pharmaceutical researchers are exploring the potential ther apeutic properties of the cannabinoid system while attempting to minimiz e problematic side effects. A significant problem surrounding the medical use of cannabis-related compounds is a concern regarding their CB -mediated psy choactiv e effects and abuse potential. The interest in developing compounds whose mechanism of action in volves CB receptors without CB involvement remains a goal in medical ther apeutics. F or this reason, selectiv e CB receptor ligands appear as potentially viable compounds for pain management (Gadotti et al. , 2013).1 2 1 2 1 1 2 2 1 2 1 2Several peer -reviewed studies conducted at Univ ersity of California, San Diego ha ve shown the value of cannabis for some pain-related conditions. One study look ed at the effect of cannabis on HIV -related peripher al neuropath y and found that pain relief w as greater with cannabis than placebo . Additionally , mood and daily functioning impro ved among the group using cannabis for pain relief . In another study , researchers look ed at the effect of smok ed cannabis on 30 participants with spasticit y due to multiple sclerosis. R esults indicated that smok ed cannabis w as superior to placebo in symptom and pain reduction in participants with treatment -resistant spasticit y (Corey -Bloom et al. , 2012). The F ood and Drug Administr ation recently appro ved an in vestigational new drug study of purified CBD . The new drug, called Epidiolex, is pro vided b y a British compan y called GW Pharmaceuticals. The drug will be used for the treatment of pediatric epilepsy in small studies at the Univ ersity of California San Fr ancisco and the NYU School of Medicine. Adjuvant Medications Adjuvant analgesics (or co-analgesics ) are drugs with a primary indication other than pain that ha ve analgesic properties. Although not primarily identified as an analgesic in nature, they ha ve been found in clinical pr actice to ha ve either an independent analgesic effect or additiv e analgesic properties when used with opioids (Khan et al. , 2011). This group includes drugs such as antidepressants, anticon vulsants, corticosteroids, neuroleptics, and other drugs with narrower adjuv ant functions. Adjuv ant drugs can be used to enhance the effects of pain medications, treat concurrent symptoms, and pro vide analgesia for other t ypes of pain. Adjuv ant analgesics are particularly useful when evidence of decreased opioid responsiv eness is present (Prommer , 2015). Adjuv ants commonly used to enhance the effects of pain medications include: Antidepressants Anticon vulsants Local anesthetics Corticosteroids Bisphosphonates Using Opioids to Manage Pain Despite low -qualit y evidence supporting pr actice change, use of chronic opioid therapy for chronic non-cancer pain increased dr amatically o ver the past two decades. Concurrently , opioid analgesic o verdose deaths, addiction, misuse, and diversion ha ve increased mark edly. Physicians for R esponsible Opioid Prescribing, 2012 Opioids are chemicals that produce morphine-lik e effects in the body; they are commonly prescribed for the treatment of both acute and chronic pain and for pain associated with cancer . Opioids ha ve a narcotic effect , that is, they induce sedation and are effectiv e for the management of man y types of pain. Adverse ev ents in opioid ther apy can include nausea, v omiting, and constipation, as well as central nerv ous system (CNS) manifestations such as dizziness, confusion, and sleep disturbance. These directly interfere with patient adherence and are attributed to opioid discontinuation in appro ximately 25% of patients (X u & Johnson, 2013). An estimated 20% of patients presenting to ph ysician offices with noncancer pain symptoms or pain-related diagnoses (including acute and chronic pain) receiv e an opioid prescription. In 2012 healthcare pro viders wrote 259 million prescriptions for opioid pain medication, enough for ev ery adult in the United States to ha ve a bottle of pills (CDC, 2016b). Dozens of compounds fall within this class of (Demerol). In addition to their effectiv e pain-relieving properties, some of these medications are used to reliev e sev ere diarrhea (eg, Lomotil, or dipheno xylate) or sev ere coughs (codeine). Opioid receptors are found throughout the nerv ous system, as well as in v ascular , gut, lung airway, cardiac, and some immune system cells. They act b y attaching to specific proteins called opioid receptors . When these drugs attach to their receptors, they reduce the perception of pain (NIDA, 2014a). There are three t ypes of opioid receptors, with similar protein sequences and structures: mu, delta, and kappa. The mu opioid receptors are thought to giv e most of their analgesic effects in the CNS , as well as man y side effects including sedation, respir atory depression, euphoria, and dependence. Most analgesic opioids are agonists on mu opioid receptors. Of all the analgesics used in pain control, the most safet y issues arise with the use of mu opioids, or morphine-lik e drugs such alent for analgesia in the peripher al nerv ous system. The kappa opioid receptors contribute to analgesia in the spine and ma y cause dysphoria and sedation, but do not gener ally lead to dependence.Regulatory agencies and expert groups ha ve encour aged prescribers to rely on evidence- based guidelines when prescribing opioids. This includes: In practice, man y primary care pro viders struggle to follow these guidelines, citing lack of clinical time for opioid management, inadequate tr aining, and low confidence. Use of opioid risk mitigation str ategies has been low in primary care, ev en among patients at high risk for misuse. It is therefore understandable that the most complex cases\u2014those in which individuals on long-term opioids, often at high doses, ha ve persistently poor function, exhibit concerning beha viors such as running out of opioids early , or dev elop a substance use disorder to an opioid or other drug\u2014 are extremely challenging to manage in primary care. Ev en among experts in the field, there is no consensus regarding how to best address these clinical situations (Beck er et al. , 2016). Benefits and Harms of Opioid Therapy Balance between benefits and harm is a critical factor influencing the strength of clinical recommendations. In recent publications, CDC has considered what is known from the epidemiology research about benefits and harms related to specific opioids and formulations, high-dose ther apy, co-prescription with other controlled substances, dur ation of use, special populations, and risk str atification and mitigation approaches (CDC, 2016b). CDC also considered the number of persons experiencing chronic pain, numbers potentially benefiting from opioids, and numbers affected b y opioid-related harms. Finally , CDC considered the effectiv eness of treatments that addressed potential harms of opioid therapy (opioid use disorder) (CDC, 2016b). Specific formulations of opioids ha ve been shown to be harmful. Serious risks ha ve been associated with the use of extended release/long- acting (ER/LA) opioid formulations. ER/LA opioids are used for management of pain sev ere enough to require daily , around-the-clock, long-term opioid treatment in patients for whom other treatment options such as non- opioid analgesics or immediate-release opioids are ineffectiv e, not ated, or would be otherwise inadequate to pro vide sufficient management of pain. Serious risks ha ve also been associated with time-scheduled opioid use, specifically substantially higher a verage daily opioid dosage than as-needed opioid use (CDC, 2016b).Use opioid treatment agreements1. Regular monitoring for efficacy , safet y, and misuse using tools such as urine drug testing and querying prescription monitoring databases and2. Provision of or referr al to addiction treatment if recurrent misuse or opioid use disorder is identified (Beck er et al. , 2016)3.Several epidemiologic studies examined the association between opioid dosage and overdose risk related to high-dose ther apy. Consistent with the clinical evidence review , opioid-related o verdose risk is dose-dependent, with higher opioid dosages associated with increased o verdose risk. A study in volving V eterans Health Administr ation patients with chronic pain found that patients who died of o verdoses related to opioids were prescribed higher opioid dosages than controls. Another recent study of o verdose deaths among state residents with and without opioid prescriptions rev ealed that prescription opioid-related overdose mortalit y rates rose r apidly up to prescribed doses of 200 MME/da y, after which the mortalit y rates continued to increase but grew more gr adually (CDC, 2016b). Epidemiologic studies suggest that concurrent use of benz odiazepines and opioids might put patients at greater risk for potentially fatal o verdose. Three studies of fatal o verdose deaths found evidence of concurrent benz odiazepine use in 31% to 61% of decedents. In one of these studies, among decedents who receiv ed an opioid prescription, those whose deaths were related to opioids were more lik ely to ha ve obtained opioids from multiple physicians and pharmacies than decedents whose deaths were not related to opioids (CDC, 2016b). Regarding dur ation of use, patients can experience toler ance and loss of effectiv eness of opioids o ver time. P atients who do not experience clinically meaningful pain relief early in treatment (ie, within 1 month) are unlik ely to experience pain relief with longer -term use (CDC, 2016b). Patients with sleep apnea or other causes of sleep-disordered breathing, patients with renal or hepatic insufficiency , older adults, pregnant women, patients with depression or other mental health conditions, and patients with alcohol or other substance use disorders have been found to ha ve an increased risk for harm from opioids. Opioid ther apy can decrease respir atory driv e and a high percentage of patients on long-term opioid ther apy have been reported to ha ve an abnormal apnea-h ypopnea index. Additionally , opioid therapy can worsen centr al sleep apnea in obstructiv e sleep apnea patients and it can cause further desatur ation in obstructiv e sleep apnea patients not on continuous positiv e airway pressure (CP AP) (CDC, 2016b). Reduced renal or hepatic function can lead to a greater peak effect and longer dur ation of action and reduce the dose at which respir atory depression and o verdose occurs. Age- related changes in patients aged 65 y ears, such as reduced renal function and medication clearance, ev en in the absence of renal disease, result in a smaller ther apeutic window for safe dosages. Older adults might also be at increased risk for falls and fr actures related to opioids (CDC, 2016b).Opioids used during pregnancy can be associated with additional risks to both mother and fetus. Some studies ha ve shown an association of opioid use in pregnancy with birth defects, including neur al tube defects, congenital heart defects, gastroschisis, preterm delivery, poor fetal growth, and stillbirth. Moreo ver, in some cases opioid use during pregnancy leads to neonatal opioid withdr awal syndrome (CDC, 2016b). Patients with mental health comorbidities and patients with a history of substance use disorders might be at higher risk than other patients for opioid use disorder . Recent analyses found that depressed patients were at higher risk for drug o verdose than patients without depression, particularly at higher opioid dosages, although in vestigators were unable to distinguish unintentional o verdose from suicide attempts. In case-control and case-cohort studies, substance abuse/dependence w as more prev alent among patients experiencing o verdose than among patients not experiencing o verdose (CDC, 2016b). Prescription drug monitoring progr ams (PDMPs) and urine drug testing pro vide potential benefits, including the abilit y to identif y patients who might be at higher risk for opioid overdose or opioid use disorder . These str ategies ma y help determine which patients will benefit from greater caution and increased monitoring or interv entions when risk factors are present. One study found that most fatal o verdoses could be identified retrospectiv ely on the basis of two pieces of information: multiple prescribers and high total daily opioid dosage. Both of these important risk factors for o verdose are a vailable to prescribers in er, limited ev aluation of PDMPs at the state lev el has rev ealed mix ed effects on changes in prescribing and mortalit y outcomes (CDC, 2016b). There is limited evidence a vailable regarding the benefits and harm of risk mitigation approaches. Although no studies were found to examine prescribing of nalo xone with opioid pain medication in primary care settings, nalo xone distribution through communit y- based progr ams pro viding prev ention services for substance users has been demonstr ated to be associated with decreased risk for opioid o verdose death at the communit y level (CDC, 2016b). Concerns ha ve been r aised that prescribing changes such as dose reduction might be associated with unintended negativ e consequences, such as patients seeking heroin or other illicitly obtained opioids or interference with appropriate pain treatment. With the exception of a study noting an association between an abuse-deterrent formulation of OxyContin and heroin use, showing that some patients in qualitativ e interviews reported switching to another opioid, including heroin, for man y reasons, including cost and availabilit y as well as ease of use, CDC did not identif y studies ev aluating these potential outcomes (CDC, 2016b).Finally , regarding the eness of opioid use disorder treatments, methadone and buprenorphine for opioid use disorder ha ve been found to increase retention in treatment and to decrease illicit opioid use among patients with opioid use disorder in volving heroin. Although findings are mix ed, some studies suggest that treatment effectiv eness is enhanced when psy chosocial treatments are used in conjunction with medication- assisted therapy; for example, b y reducing opioid misuse and increasing retention during maintenance ther apy, and ving compliance after deto xification potential side effects, toler ance, and addiction, opioid use can be associated with opioid-induced hyperalgesia , which is defined as a state of nociceptiv e sensitization caused b y exposure to opioids. It is char acteriz ed by a par adoxical response whereb y a patient receiving opioids for the treatment of pain actually becomes more sensitiv e to pain (Suzan et al. , 2013). Opioid-induced h yperalgesia in the post oper ative period has been reported following the administr ation of short -acting opioids during surgery . Additional evidence comes from opioid addicts on methadone maintenance ther apy, in whom decreased toler ance to cold pain has been reported. Mix ed results are found regarding h yperalgesia in patients with chronic pain who receiv e intermediate-term opioid treatment (Suzan et al. , 2013). Opioid Reassessment In an effort to support primary care in the management of patients with complex chronic pain on long-term opioid ther apy, a multi-disciplinary team designed the Opioid Reassessment Clinic (ORC) at V A Connecticut Healthcare S ystem (Beck er et al. , 2016). Located in the primary care setting, the clinic is staffed b y an addiction psy chiatrist, an internist with addiction and pain tr aining, a beha vioral health adv anced pr actice nurse, and a clinical health psy chologist. The clinic has serv ed as a learning opportunit y for management of complex chronic pain and opioids o ver the past three y ears. The following case highlights evidence-based pr actices as well as approaches based on pr agmatic consider ations where evidence is lacking (Beck er et al. , 2016). Case This is a 56- year-old patient with bilater al hip pain due to sev ere osteoarthritis that significantly interfered with functioning, for which the patient w as prescribed morphine for sev eral years. Nine months prior to Opioid R eassessment Clinic (ORC) referr al, the patient successfully completed a residential treatment progr am for his long-standing alcohol use disorder while continuing on long-term opioid ther apy. Presently , the primary care pro vider referred the patient to the ORC after two episodes of running out of opioid prescriptions early (without early refill) and a brief return to alcohol use. In the ORC, clinicians facilitated engagement in outpatient alcohol treatment b y making continued opioid ther apy contingent upon adherence with followup , and required frequent ORC visits including breathalyz er tests and urine drug screens. F ollowing another return to drinking, the patient w as admitted to an intensiv e outpatient alcohol use disorder treatment progr am and w as simultaneously tapered off morphine, transitioning to tr amadol with adjuv ant non-opioid medications including an NS AID, gabapentin, and topical lidocaine. While tr amadol, a weak mu receptor agonist with more prominent serotonin and norepinephrine reuptak e inhibition, w as still a risky medication in this patient in recovery, it is classified b y the DEA as less risky (schedule V compared to o xycodone and morphine' s schedule II designation); plus the patient 's tramadol dose w as mark edly lower in terms of morphine-equiv alent daily dose. Additionally , orthopedics w as consulted and agreed to schedule hip replacement surgery contingent upon sev eral months of documented alcohol abstinence. This motiv ated the patient to adhere to appointments and monitoring as required b y both ORC and addiction treatment pro viders. While the patient continued to request a switch to a \"stronger \" opioid, the ORC repeatedly reiter ated that this w as not an option given the recent history of misuse, the lack of evidence of impro ved functioning on such medications, and benefit of being on the lowest possible opioid dose prior to surgery . After 6 months of abstinence from alcohol, safe use of tr amadol, and engagement in multimodal ther apy including ongoing specialt y treatment, the patient w as discharged from ORC to followup with primary care providers while a waiting scheduled surgery . Epilogue: The patient underwent total hip replacement and receiv ed 2 weeks of full agonist opioid treatment (MSIR 15 mg Q6 PRN) following the surgery . After the 2- week post-oper ative period, the patient w as transitioned back to tr amadol. He remains abstinent from alcohol and participates fully in his hip rehabilitation progr am.Source: Becker et al., 2016. Tolerance, Dependence, and Addiction Thirty years ago , I attended medical school in New Y ork. In the k ey lecture on pain management, the professor told us confidently that patients who receiv ed prescription narcotics for pain would not become addicted. While pain management remains an essential patient right, a gener ation of healthcare professionals, patients, and families ha ve learned the hard w ay how deeply misguided that assertion w as. Narcotics\u2014both illegal and legal\u2014 are dangerous drugs that can destro y lives and communities. Thomas Frieden, MD Director , CDC A number of terms and definitions are regularly used to define beha viors that are associated with the misuse and abuse of drugs. These terms are imprecise and at times confusing and can reflect societal attitudes and beliefs about drug abuse. So it is not surprising that medical terminology associated with drug use and abuse is opaque and at times unclear , particularly in the area of prescription drug abuse. To address this issue and to clarif y the terms dependence and addiction , particularly in opioid-treated patients, new definitions for drug addiction ha ve been included in the 2013 DSM- V update. The term \"substance dependence\"\u2014used in DSM- III and DSM- IV\u2014has been replaced b y the terms \"substance use disorder \" and \"opioid use disorder \" (IASP, 2013). Additional changes in the DSM- V state that two items (not including toler ance and withdr awal) are needed from a list of beha viors suggesting compulsiv e use to meet the criteria for substance use disorder (SUD). T olerance and withdr awal are not counted for those taking prescribed medications under medical supervision such as analgesics, antidepressants, anti- anxiet y medications, or beta-block ers (IA SP, 2013). Tolerance Tolerance is a state of adaptation in which a drug becomes less effectiv e over time, which means a larger dose is needed to achiev e the same effect. T olerance occurs because some drugs cause the br ain to release 2 to 10 times the amount of dopamine than natur al rewards do . In some cases, this occurs almost immediately \u2014especially when drugs are smok ed or injected\u2014 and the effects can last much longer than those produced b y natur al means. The resulting effects on the br ain's pleasure circuit dw arfs those produced b y natur system\u2014the circuit. Source: National Institute on Drug Abuse. Source: National Institute on Drug Abuse, 2018. The br ain adapts to these o verwhelming surges in dopamine b y producing less dopamine or b y reducing the number of dopamine receptors in the reward circuit. This reduces the user 's abilit y to enjo y not only the drugs but also other ev ents in life that previously brought pleasure. This decrease compels the person to k eep abusing drugs in an attempt to bring the dopamine function back to normal, but now larger amounts of the drug are required to achiev e the same dopamine high (NIDA, 2016a). Dependence Dependence is a state of adaptation char acteriz ed by symptoms of withdr awal when a medication is abruptly stopped, the dose is r apidly reduced, or an antagonist is administered. It is a term often misused as a synon ym for addiction, but the two terms are not synon ymous. The seriousness of the withdr awal symptoms depends upon the drug being used and the extent of its use (risks increase with higher doses o ver long periods of time). F or some drugs, such as alcohol or benz odiazepines, withdr awal symptoms can be serious and life-threatening.An example of dependence is a patient who is on morphine for sev eral months for chronic back pain. If the morphine is discontinued all at once, a flu-lik e syndrome will quickly develop, accompanied b y nausea, stomach pains, and malaise. These symptoms of physical dependence will disappear if the morphine is resumed. Once a person has been on opioids for a period of time, the medication must be tapered off to a void withdr awal symptoms. Addiction It is often said that addiction is easy to recogniz e, that it r arely arises during the treatment of pain with addictiv e drugs, and that cases of addiction during pain treatment can be managed in much the same w ay as other addictions, but such gener alizations grossly o versimplif y the real situation. International Association for the Study of P ain Addiction is defined as a chronic, relapsing disease that is char acteriz ed by compulsiv e drug seeking and use, despite the known, harmful consequences. Addiction in volves a psychological cr aving and is considered a br ain disease because drugs change the br ain's structure and function. Br ain changes can be long lasting and can lead to the harmful behaviors seen in people who abuse drugs. Although taking drugs at an y age can lead to addiction, research shows that the earlier a person begins to use drugs the more lik ely they are to progress to more serious abuse (NIDA, 2014c). Addiction The term addiction may be regarded as equiv alent to severe substance use disorder as defined b y the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, Fifth Edition (DSM- 5, 2013) (NIDA, 2014c). Opioids are highly addictiv e and r ates of addiction among patients receiving opioids for the management of pain v ary from 1% to 50%, which suggest uncertaint y about what addiction really is and how often it occurs (IA SP, 2013). Sa vage and colleagues introduced the four \"Cs\" criteria for identif ying opioid addiction in chronic pain population: Impaired Control o ver drug use 1. Compulsiv e use 2. Continued use despite harm 3. Unmanageable drug Craving (Chang & Compton, 2013). 4.A strategy to distinguish between aberr ant or misuse beha viors and addiction in chronic pain patients is to assess the relationship between opioid dose titr ation and functional restor ation. In in response to aberr ant \"drug-seeking\" beha viors (ie, continued complaints of pain or requests for more medication), the clinician increases the opioid dose in an effort to pro vide analgesia. Impro vements in functional outcomes and qualit y of life, with fewer problematic beha viors, indicate that activ e addiction is not present. In this case, drug-seeking beha viors ma y in functional restor ation (Chang & Compton, 2013). Treating Patients with a History of Substance Abuse Treating chronic pain with chronic opioid ther apy in individuals with a history of a substance use disorder (SUD), whether activ e or in remission, presents a challenge to pain clinicians. This is, in part, due to concerns about the patient relapsing to activ e substance abuse. In addition, clinicians ma y confuse \"drug-seeking\" beha viors with addictiv e disease, resulting in poor treatment outcomes, such as premature discharge of patients from pain care (Chang & Compton, 2013). The goal of chronic pain treatment in patients with SUDs is the same as that for patients without SUDs: specifically , to maximiz e functionalit y while pro viding pain relief . Howev er, reluctance to prescribe opioids and poor understanding of the complex relationship between pain and addiction often results in undertreated pain in this population (Chang & Compton, 2013). When estimating the presence of substance use disorder in chronic pain patients, terminology is important. It is increasingly understood that SUD cannot be defined b y physical dependence and toler ance, as these are predictable ph ysiologic consequences of chronic opioid use. R eflecting this, in the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, 5th Edition (DSM- V), toler ance and withdr awal are not counted as criteria for the substance use and addictiv e disorder diagnosis if a patient is taking an opioid analgesic under medical supervision (Chang & Compton, 2013). A systematic review of liter ature synthesizing 21 studies published prior to F ebruary 2012 showed that the o verall prev alence of current substance use disorders in chronic pain patients r anges from 3% to 48% depending on the population sampled. The lifetime prevalence of an y substance use disorder r anged from 16% to 74% in patients visiting the ED, with those visiting for opioid refill ha ving the highest r ate. It has been reported that 3% to 11% of chronic pain patients with a history of substance use disorder ma y dev elop opioid addiction or abuse, whereas only less than 1% of those without a prior or current history of SUD dev elop the same (Chang & Compton, 2013).When screening patients for a history of substance abuse, one of the easiest tools to use is the National Institute on Drug Abuse (NIDA) Drug Use Screening T ool. It begins with a Quick Screen, which recommends that clinicians ask their patients one question: \"In the past y ear, how often ha ve you used alcohol, tobacco products, prescription drugs for nonmedical reasons, or illegal drugs?\" P atients are ask ed to respond on a 5-point continuum: nev er, once or twice, monthly , weekly , or daily/almost daily . A response of \"at least 1 time\" when ask ed about frequency of prescription or illegal drug use is considered a positiv e result. R ecent research has identified that this single-question screening test is highly sensitiv e and specific for identif ying drug use and drug use disorders (NIDA, 2014a). For those who screen positiv e for illicit or nonmedical prescription drug use, clinicians are directed to administer the full NIDA -modified Alcohol, Smoking, and Substance Involvement Screening T est (NM- ASSIST). The NM- ASSIST automatically gener ates a risk level to indicate the lev el of interv ention needed and pro vides additional resources such as scripts on how to discuss drug use with patients and resources to link patients to specialt y care (NIDA, 2016b). Source: NIDA, 2012a.Identifying Risk Level High risk Score 27Provide feed back on the screening results Advise, assess, and assist Arrange referral Offer continuing support Moderate Risk Score 4-26Provide feed back Advise, assess, and assist Consider referral based on clinical judgment Offer continuing support Low Risk Score 0-3Provide feed back Reinforce abstinence Offer continuing support Untreated AddictionIn man y primary care or pain management settings, the abilit y to pro vide the comprehensiv e services necessary to treat patients with both pain and current addiction are sorely lacking. Some clinicians strongly believ e that patients with chronic pain and active addiction, regardless of t ype of substance abused, are not candidates for chronic opioid ther apy (Chang & Compton, 2013). Patients with an activ e substance use disorder should be referred to formal addiction treatment. It is incumbent upon the prescribing clinician to maintain a referr al network of substance abuse treatment pro viders willing to collabor ate on pro viding care to patients with co-morbid pain and substance use disorder . After referr al, a pain clinician should continue to work closely with the SUD treatment pro vider to monitor use beha viors and pain outcomes (Chang & Compton, 2013). Addiction in Remission For individuals with addiction in remission, the goal of treatment is the same as that as for all chronic pain patients: to impro ve pain and maintain functionalit y. Indicators of successful pain management include: The patient 's abilit y to comply with regimens The abilit y to engage in cognitiv e-beha vioral pain management str ategies Utilization of positiv e coping skills to manage stress and The abilit y to establish better social support systems (Chang & Compton, 2013) Management of co-morbid neuropsy chiatric complications is critical to maximiz e functionalit y (Chang & Compton, 2013). Regardless of the t ype of substance previously abused, exposure to psy choactiv e medications can lead to relapse in patients with a recently or poorly treated substance use disorder . Although concerns of relapse ma y contribute to clinicians' reluctance to prescribe chronic opioid ther apy for patients whose addiction is in remission, there is evidence that patients with successfully treated addiction can be effectiv ely treated with opioids for chronic pain (Chang & Compton, 2013). In patients with substance use disorder in remission, clinicians must assess the patient 's relativ e risk for relapse and monitor for its emergence. The abilit y to manage a relapse episode is a necessary skill of an y chronic opioid ther apy prescriber . To assess risk of relapse, a series of questions should be ask ed of the chronic pain patient regarding the status of SUD remission. Asking these questions at each visit allows for early identification of high-risk situations and potential coping responses to these stressors (Chang & Compton, 2013).How long y ou been in reco very? How engaged are y ou in addiction reco very efforts and treatment (ie, supportiv e counseling, 12-step progr am)? What t ypes of drugs ha ve you abused? What are current stressors that might precipitate relapse (unreliev ed pain, sleep disorders, withdr awal symptoms, psy chiatric symptoms, interpersonal conflicts)? What are y our current protectiv e factors against relapse, including impro ved coping responses and a social support system? How stable y ou feel in reco very? (Chang & Compton, 2013) A relapse contr act can be dev eloped early in treatment, which is individualiz ed to the patient and specifies steps or actions that will be tak en by both the patient and clinician if relapse occurs. The patient 's beha viors with respect to the opioid analgesic regimen provide the best evidence for the presence of activ e addiction (Chang & Compton, 2013) The clinician should k eep in mind that seeking a higher dose of a prescribed medication does not necessarily mean that the patient is drug-seeking. Howev er, losing or forging prescriptions, stealing or ha ving others steal for y ou, visiting multiple pro viders for duplicate prescriptions, and injecting or al formulations are signs that the patient is not using the medication appropriately . Management of pain requires a great degree of trust on both sides. Being consistent, open, and fair are important attributes for the pro vider. Providing positiv e feedback, reducing harm through education, and attempting to understand individual circumstances are helpful to the patient. If the patient is approaching the end of life, old habits and fears often resurface and more support ma y be needed. Children and Opioids Thankfully , not man y children experience the t ypes of cancer pain, extensiv e trauma, or surgeries that require long-term pain management. Howev er, few pain management products ha ve specific information on their label about their safet y and effectiv eness in pediatric patients. This ev en includes sev eral new pain medications that ha ve been appro ved for use in adults. To manage pain in pediatric patients, ph ysicians often ha ve to rely on their own experience to interpret and tr anslate adult data into dosing information for pediatric patients. Sharon Hertz, MD , Director FDA, Office of New Drugs Center for Drug Ev aluation and R esearch, Division of Anesthesia, Analgesia, and Addiction Products The use of opioids to treat pain in infants and children presents challenges. First, with r are exceptions, opioids ha ve not been labeled for use in individuals under 18 y ears of age. There is a dearth of qualit y studies on pharmacokinetics, pharmacodynamics, safet y, and clinical effectiv eness. Acute pain problems in pediatrics ha ve man y char acteristics in common with adult presentations. P ersistent, recurrent, and chronic pain in infants, children, and adolescents are often qualitativ ely different from chronic pain problems in adults. T reatment approaches ma y vary accordingly (Oregon P ain Guidance, 2016). In adults, there is a well-recogniz ed epidemic of hospitalizations and deaths related to the increasing use of opioid analgesics. Although there are fewer studies in children, this vulner able population also appears to be at high risk for opioid to xicity. A study of 960 randomly selected medical records from 12 children' s hospitals in the United States identified 107 adv erse drug ev ents with more than half attributable to opioid analgesics. Deaths ha ve been reported in y oung children related to ther apeutic use of codeine and hydrocodone in doses within or moder ately ex ceeding recommended pediatric limits (Chung et al. , 2015). Despite their potential for serious adv erse ev ents, opioids are increasingly prescribed for adolescents. Opioid prescriptions for patients between 15 and 19 y ears of age doubled from 1994 to 2007, with estimates that opioids are prescribed in nearly 6% of ambulatory and emergency department visits made b y adolescents in the United States (Chung et al. , 2015). Given the large number of pediatric patients receiving prescribed opioids, there is an urgent need for fundamental epidemiologic studies to inform the risk -benefit decisions of prescribers and families. An essential component of these studies is the identification of serious adv erse reactions related to opioids. Epidemiologic studies in adults ha ve developed procedures to identif y hospitalizations and deaths related to opioid use. Howev er, similar studies in children are lacking (Chung et al. , 2015). Clinical recommendations for chronic non-malignant pain in children and adolescents include (W alco, 2015): Prescribe opioids for acute pain in infants and children only if knowledgeable in pediatric medicine, dev elopmental elements of pain systems, and differences in pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics in y oung children.Avoid opioids in the v ast majorit y of chronic nonmalignant pain problems in children and adolescents, as evidence shows no indication. Opioids are indicated for a small number of persistent painful conditions, including those with clear pathoph ysiology and when an endpoint to usage ma y be defined. Opioids ma y be indicated for some chronic pain conditions in children and adolescents, when there is clear pathoph ysiology , and no definable endpoint. Consult or refer to a pediatric pain specialist when chronic pain problems in children and adolescents are complicated or persistent. Managing Cancer Pain with Opioids The use of opioids for the relief of moder ate to sev ere cancer pain is considered necessary for most patients. F or moder ate pain, weak opioids such as codeine or tr amadol or lower doses of strong opioids such as morphine, o xycodone, or h ydromorphone are often administered and frequently combined with non-opioid analgesics. F or sev ere pain, strong opioids are routinely used. Although no agent has shown itself to be more effectiv e than any other agent, morphine is often considered the opioid of choice because of pro vider familiarit y, broad a vailabilit y, and lower cost. In one well-designed review , most individuals with moder ate to sev ere cancer pain obtained significant pain relief from or al morphine (NCI, 2016). Effectiv e pain management requires close monitoring of patient response to treatment. In a review of 1,612 patients referred to an outpatient palliativ e care center , more than half of patients with moder ate to sev ere pain did not experience pain relief after the initial palliativ e care consultation. In addition, one-third of patients with mild pain progressed to moder ate to sev ere pain b y the time of their first followup visit (NCI, 2016). For patients with a poor pain prognosis, clinicians ma y consider discussing realistic goals for alleviating pain, focusing on function, and use of multimodalit y interv entions. R epeated or frequent escalation of analgesic doses without impro vement of pain ma y trigger clinicians to consider an alternativ e approach to pain (NCI, 2016). Abuse of Opioid Analgesics Here I lie in m y hospital bed Tell me, sister morphine, when are y ou coming round again? Oh, I don' t think I can w ait that long Oh, y ou see that m y pain is so strong Source: CD C, 2016b.The scream of the ambulance is soundin' in m y ear Tell me, sister morphine, how long ha ve I been lying here? What am I doing in this place? Why does the doctor ha ve no face? Marianne F aithfull, Sister Morphine The United States is in the midst of an unprecedented drug o verdose epidemic. Since 1999 prescription drug o verdose death r ates ha ve quadrupled (CDC, 2016b). In 2009, for the first time in U .S. history , drug o verdose deaths outnumbered motor v ehicle deaths (CDC, 2013a). Since pain w as coined \"the fifth vital sign\" in the 1990s, sales of prescription opioids in the Unites States ha ve quadrupled (see below) (Bartels et al. , 2016). This increase in the prescription of opioids for pain management has been accompanied b y a dr amatic rise in prescription opioid- associated morbidit y and mortalit y. In 2010 more than 16,000 deaths were attributed to prescription opioids, making them a leading cause of injury death in the gener al population (Bartels et al. , 2016). There are now more deaths from opioid-related o verdoses than from all other illicit drugs combined. Emergency department visits, substance treatment admissions, and economic costs associated with opioid abuse have all soared (CDC, 2013a). Some startling statistics illustr ate the magnitude of the abuse problem. Between 1997 and 2011 the U .S. population increased only 16%, howev er the number of prescription pain medications sold b y pharmacies increased significantly more than that. Between 1997 and 2011: Oxycodone sales increased b y 1,259% Hydrocodone sales increased b y 356% Methadone sales increased b y 1,099% Fentan yl sales increased b y 711% Morphine sales increased b y 246% Buprenorphine sales increased from 17 gr ams in 2002 to 1,639 kg in 2011 (McDonald & Carlson, 2013) USA Opioid Consumption (mg/capita), 2000-2014 Sources: International Narcotics Control Board; World Health Organization population data By: Pain and Policy Studies Group, University of Wisconsin/WHO Collaborating Center, 2016. The increased a vailabilit y of opioid analgesics means they are being used in w ays that are unsafe or unintended. OxyContin, for example, which w as designed as a slow -release, or al medication is now being crushed, then snorted or injected, with lethal consequences. T o combat this, new formulations are being designed to deter some of these abuses. F or example, a new formulation of OxyContin releases from 21% to 48% less opioid when tampered with (milled, manually crushed, dissolv ed, and boiled) than the original v ersion (Raffa et al. , 2012). Paradoxically , despite an enormous rise in spending and prescription, there is limited evidence to support the efficacy of opioids in chronic noncancer pain management. In a European surv ey on chronic pain, 15% of respondents felt that their medications were not very, or not at all, effectiv e (Xu & Johnson, 2013). A systematic review b y Chou and colleagues suggested limited efficacy of long-term opioid ther apy over short -term treatment or placebo , while an evidence review b y the Institute of Medicine concluded that the effectiv eness of opioids as pain reliev ers, especially o ver the long term, is somewhat unclear (X u & Johnson, 2013). A surv ey of pain management in sixteen European countries conducted in 2003 found that 28% of surv ey respondents used prescription opioids. Of particular interest, the countries reporting higher percentage of opioid use were no more satisfied with their pain control than those with lower prev alence of use (X u & Johnson, 2013).Prescribing r ates for opioids v ary widely across states. In 2012 healthcare pro viders in the highest -prescribing state wrote almost 3 times as man y opioid painkiller prescriptions per person as those in the lowest prescribing state (CDC, 2016b). Health issues that cause people pain do not v ary much from place to place, and do not explain this v ariabilit y in prescribing. Some factors that ma y influence prescribing r ates include: Healthcare pro viders in different parts of the country do not agree on when to prescribe opioid painkillers and how much to prescribe. Some of the increased demand for prescription opioids is from people who use them non-medically , who sell them, or who obtain them from multiple prescribers. Many states report problems with for -profit, high- volume pain clinics (so-called pill mills) that prescribe large quantities of painkillers to people who don' t need them medically (CDC, 2016b). CDC, 2016b Prescription Drug Abuse Prescription drug abuse is the use of a medication without a prescription, in a w ay other than as prescribed, or for the experience or feelings elicited. According to sev eral national surveys, prescription medications, such as those used to treat pain, attention deficit disorders, and anxiet y, are being abused at a r ate second only to marijuana among illicit drug users. The consequences of this abuse ha ve been steadily worsening, reflected in increased treatment admissions, emergency room visits, and o verdose deaths (NIDA, 2014b).Prescription drug abuse can include taking a drug prescribed for someone else, taking more of the medication than was prescribed, taking medication more frequently than was directed, or altering the formulation (crushing, snorting) so as to obtain a greater amount of active agent than was originally intended (NIDA, 2012b). Opioid pain medication use presents serious risks, including overdose and opioid use disorder. From 1999 to 2014, more than 165,000 persons died from overdose related to opioid pain medication in the United States. In the past decade, while the death r ates for the top leading causes of death such as heart disease and cancer ha ve decreased substantially, the death rate associated with opioid pain medication has increased markedly. Sales of opioid pain medication have increased in parallel with opioid-related overdose deaths. The Drug Abuse Warning Network estimated that >420,000 ED visits were related to the misuse or abuse of narcotic pain relievers in 2011, the most recent year for which data are available (CDC, 2016a). Although clinical criteria have varied over time, opioid use disorder is a problematic pattern of opioid use leading to clinically significant impairment or distress. This disorder is manifested by specific criteria such as unsuccessful efforts to cut down or control use and use resulting in social problems and a failure to fulfill major role obligations at work, school, or home. This diagnosis has also been referred to as \"abuse or dependence\" and \"addiction\" in the literature, and is different from tolerance (diminished response to a drug with repeated use) and physical dependence (adaptation to a drug that produces symptoms of withdrawal when the drug is stopped), both of which can exist without a diagnosed disorder (CDC, 2016a). In 2013, on the basis of DSM-IV diagnosis criteria, an estimated 1.9 million people abused or were dependent on prescription opioid pain medication. Having a history of a prescription for an opioid pain medication increases the risk for o verdose and opioid use disorder, highlighting the value of guidance on safer prescribing practices for clinicians. For example, a recent study of patients aged 15 to 64 years receiving opioids for chronic noncancer pain and followed for up to 13 years revealed that 1 in 550 patients died from opioid-related overdose at a median of 2.6 years from their first opioid prescription, and 1 in 32 patients who escalated to opioid dosages >200 morphine milligr am equivalents (MME) died overdose 2016a). Did You Know. . . Enough prescription painkillers were prescribed in 2010 to medicate every American adult around-the-clock for one month (CDC, n.d.).Several factors have been put forth to explain the rise in opioid prescriptions for chronic noncancer pain that began in the 1980s and became dominant one decade later: Reservations against alternative pain therapies, especially those related to adverse events associated with long-term use of NSAIDs Aggressive and, at times, misleading product marketing by the manufacturers A widespread belief that opioid therapy carries a low risk of addiction potential (Xu & Johnson, 2013) Overdose and Poisoning Poisoning is now the leading cause of death from injuries in the United States, and nearly 9 out of 10 poisoning deaths are caused by drugs. Margaret Warner, 2011 From 1999 to 2011, the age-adjusted rate for opioid-analgesic poisoning deaths nearly quadrupled. However, the increase in rates seems to be slowing. For opioid-analgesic poisoning deaths, there was an 18% increase each year from 1999 through 2006 but only a 3% increase each year from 2006 through 2011 (NCHS, 2014). Deaths from opioid analgesics often involve other drugs. Benzodiazepines have been reported frequently in deaths involving opioid analgesics. Over the past decade, there has been an upward trend in the presence of benzodiazepines in opioid-analgesic poisoning deaths. In 1999 benzodiazepines were involved in 13% of the opioid analgesic poisoning deaths; by 2011, 31% NCHS, 2014. Intertwined Epidemics: Prescription Opioids and Heroin The enormous increase in the a vailabilit y of prescription pain medications is dr awing new users to these drugs and changing the geogr aphy and age-grouping of opiate-related overdoses. Prescription opioid-related o verdoses currently represent the second leading cause of injury -related death in the United States and the leading cause of death for 35- to 54-year-olds. This has led to an increase in healthcare utilization that is troubling for both its high social and healthcare-related costs (Unick et al. , 2013). While man y drugs and medicines ha ve potential for o verdose, the use of both prescription opioids and heroin (often tak en in combination with other medicines and drugs) has increased since 1999. With increased use of opioids, communities ha ve seen increases in overdose hospitalizations and deaths and need for treatment. Data on the sales of legally prescribed medicines (opioids in particular) and data on o verdose hospitalizations and deaths can be used to illustr ate the progression of an epidemic of o verdose hospitalizations and deaths (OHA, 2014).Most of the current cases of opioid-related o verdoses can be tr aced to two fronts: (1) illegal heroin consumption, and (2) the illicit use or misuse of prescription opioids. Giv en the differences in the sources of opioids and the financial and social costs associated with overdose cases, it is important to understand the dynamics of the opioid-related o verdose epidemic and the changing char acteristics of opiate abusers (Unick et al. , 2013). The rise in prescription opioid-related o verdose deaths has been particularly alarming in rural areas; between 1999 and 2004 prescription opioid-related o verdose deaths increased 52% in large urban counties and a staggering 371% in non-urban counties (Unick et al. , 2013). Significant increases in drug o verdose death r ates were seen in the Northeast, Midwest and South census regions. In 2014 the fiv e states with the highest r ates of death due to drug overdose were W est Virginia, New Mexico , New Hampshire, K entucky , and Ohio . States with statistically significant increases in the r ate from 2013 to 2014 included Alabama, Georgia, Illinois, Indiana, Maine, Maryland, Massachusetts, Michigan, New Hampshire, New Mexico , North Dak ota, Ohio , Pennsylv ania, and Virginia (CDC, 2016b). Drug Overdose Increase, 2013-2014 Statistically significant drug overdose death rate increase from 2013 to 2014, U.S. states. There is an ev olving flux between prescription opioid use and heroin use in urban areas. Ethnogr aphic work from Montreal shows that individuals at risk for heroin use ha ve begun shifting to injecting prescription opioids. Additional evidence from Baltimore and Washington State suggests a high prev alence of prescription abuse in injection drug using populations, often preceding heroin use. Interestingly , recent changes to the formulation of OxyContin, the br and name long- acting form of o xycodone, ha ve been link ed to a self - reported rise in heroin use. What these studies suggest is that prescription opioid misuse and heroin use are intertwined (Unick et al. , 2013). Abuse Among Adolescents and Young Adults Adolescents and y oung adults are especially vulner able to prescription drug abuse, particularly opioids and stimulants. According to the Monitoring the Future (MTF) surv ey, an ongoing study of the beha vior and attitudes of American y outh in volving nearly 45,000 8th, 10th, and 12th gr ade students, with regard to illicit drugs, annual prev alence declined for synthetic marijuana, heroin, MDMA (ecstasy , Molly), sedativ es, and nonmedical use of any prescription drug. Annual prev alence of using an y illicit drug remained essentially unchanged in all three gr ades in 2015 (Johnston et al. , 2015). Psychother apeutic drugs now mak e up a significantly larger part of the o verall U.S. drug problem than w as true 10 to 15 y ears ago . This is in part because use increased for man y prescription drugs o ver that period, and in part because use of a number of street drugs has declined substantially since the mid- to late-1990s. It seems lik ely that y oung people are less concerned about the dangers of using these prescription drugs outside of medical regimen because they are widely used for legitimate purposes. (Indeed, the low lev els of perceiv ed risk for sedativ es and amphetamines observ ed among 12th gr aders illustr ate this point.) Also , prescription psy chother apeutic drugs are now being adv ertised directly to the consumer , which implies that they are both widely used and safe to use. F ortunately , the use of most of these drugs has either lev eled or begun to decline in the past few y ears. The proportion of 12th gr aders misusing an y of these prescription drugs (eg, amphetamines, sedativ es, tranquiliz ers, or narcotics other than heroin) in the prior y ear continued to decline in 2015 down from its high in 2005 (Johnston et al. , 2015). Amphetamine use without a doctor 's orders\u2014currently the second most widely used class of illicit drugs after marijuana\u2014continued a gr adual decline in 2015 in all gr ades, though the one- year declines did not reach statistical significance. Use of narcotics other than heroin without a doctor 's orders (measured only in 12th gr ade) also continued a gr adual decline begun after 2009 (Johnston et al. , 2015). Source: National Institute on Drug Abuse, 2015. Abuse Among Middle-Aged and Older Adults Prescription opioid-related o verdoses r ates are increasing the most in middle- aged individuals. Older adults represent another area of concern. Although older adults currently comprise just 13% of the population, they account for more than one-third of total outpatient spending on prescription medications in the United States. Older patients are more lik ely to be prescribed long-term and multiple prescriptions, which could lead to misuse or abuse (NIDA, 2014b). The high r ates of comorbid illnesses in older populations, age-related changes in drug metabolism, and the potential for drug inter actions ma y mak e any of these pr actices more dangerous than in y ounger populations. Further , a large percentage of older adults also use over-the-counter medicines and dietary supplements, which (in addition to alcohol) could compound an y adv erse health consequences resulting from prescription drug abuse (NIDA, 2014b). Gender Differences in Opioid AbuseOverall, adult men and women ha ve roughly similar r ates of nonmedical use of prescription drugs, although some studies suggest that women are more lik ely than men to be prescribed prescription drugs, particularly narcotics and anti- anxiet y drugs. Adolescent females are more lik ely than males to use psy chother apeutic drugs nonmedically . Research has also suggested that women are at increased risk for nonmedical use of narcotic analgesics and tr anquiliz ers such as benz odiazepines (CDC, 2013b). Prescription pain medication o verdoses are increasing among women. Although men are still more lik ely to die of prescription painkiller o verdoses (more than 10,000 deaths in 2010), the gap between men and women is closing. Deaths from prescription painkiller overdose among women ha ve risen more sharply than among men; since 1999 the percentage increase in deaths w as more than 400% among women compared to 265% in men. This rise relates closely to increased prescribing of these drugs during the past decade (CDC, 2013b). Deaths of Women from Prescription Painkillers, 1999-2010 Prescription painkiller deaths among women have increased dramatically since 1999. Source: CD C, 2013b. Prescription Painkillers: Growing Problem Among Women More than 5 times as man y women died from prescription painkiller o verdoses in 2010 than in 1999. Women between the ages of 25 and 54 are more lik ely than other age groups to go to the emergency department from prescription painkiller misuse or abuse. Women ages 45 to 54 ha ve the highest risk of dying from a prescription painkiller overdose.* Non-Hispanic white and American Indian or Alaska Nativ e women ha ve the highest risk of dying from a prescription painkiller o verdose. Prescription painkillers are in volved in 1 in 10 suicides among women. *Death data include unintentional, suicide, and other deaths. Emergency department visits only include suicide attempts if an illicit drug was involved in the attempt. Prescription Painkillers Affect Women Differently than Men Women are more lik ely to ha ve chronic pain, be prescribed prescription painkillers, be giv en higher doses, and use them for longer time periods than men. Women ma y become dependent on prescription painkillers more quickly than men. Women ma y be more lik ely than men to engage in \"doctor shopping\" (obtaining prescriptions from multiple prescribers). Abuse of prescription painkillers b y pregnant women can put an infant at risk. Cases of neonatal abstinence syndrome (NA S)\u2014which is a group of problems that can occur in newborns exposed to prescription painkillers or other drugs while in the womb\u2014grew b y almost 300% in the United States between 2000 and 2009.

Opioid Abuse and Chronic Pain Diagnosed chronic pain patients mak e up less than 1% of the insured population in the United States but consume about 45% of all prescription opioids. It has been estimated that up to 40% of pain patients on chronic opioid ther apy displa y aberr ant drug-related behaviors (R affa et al. , 2012). Chronic pain is defined as pain that t ypically lasts >3 months or past the time of normal tissue healing. Chronic pain can be the result of an underlying medical disease or condition, injury , medical treatment, inflammation, or an unknown cause (CDC, 2016b). Prevention, assessment, and treatment of chronic pain are challenges for health pro viders and systems. P ain might go unrecogniz ed, and patients, particularly members of r acial and ethnic minorit y groups, women, elders, people with cognitiv e impairment, and those with cancer and at the end of life, can be at risk for inadequate pain treatment. P atients can experience persistent pain that is not well controlled. There are clinical, psy chological, and social consequences associated with chronic pain including limitations in complex activities, lost work productivit y, reduced qualit y of life, and stigma, emphasizing the importance of appropriate and compassionate patient care. P atients should receiv e appropriate pain treatment based on a careful consider ation of the benefits and risks of treatment options (CDC, 2016b).Chronic pain has been intertwined with substance abuse: 33% of individuals in a substance abuse progr am reported suffering from chronic pain and individuals in substance abuse treatment progr ams with chronic pain were significantly more lik ely to abuse opioids than those not reporting chronic pain. The term rational abuse has been put forth to describe chronic pain patients who abuse opioids because of undertreated pain, but v ery little is known about this population (R affa et al. , 2012). Sales of opioid pain medication ha ve increased in par allel with opioid-related o verdose deaths. The Drug Abuse W arning Network estimated that >420,000 emergency department visits were related to the misuse or abuse of narcotic pain reliev ers in 2011, the most recent y ear for which data are a vailable. Although clinical criteria ha ve varied over time, opioid use disorder is a problematic pattern of opioid use leading to clinically significant impairment or distress (CDC, 2016b). This disorder is manifested b y specific criteria, such as unsuccessful efforts to cut down or control use, and use resulting in social problems and a failure to fulfill major role obligations at work, school, or home. This diagnosis has also been referred to as \"abuse or dependence\" and \"addiction\" in the liter ature, and is different from toler ance (diminished response to a drug with repeated use) and ph ysical dependence (adaptation to a drug that produces symptoms of withdr awal when the drug is stopped), both of which can exist without a diagnosed disorder (CDC, 2016b). Abuse of Methadone Methadone is a synthetic narcotic first dev eloped b y German scientists during W orld W ar II to address a shortage of morphine. Methadone w as introduced into the United States in 1947 as an analgesic (Dolophinel) and has emerged as a commonly prescribed medication for the management of pain. Methadone is also used for the treatment of opioid dependence, in which case it ma y be dispensed only in feder ally appro ved opioid treatment progr ams. Drug Enforcement Administr ation (DEA) data suggest that abuse of methadone div erted from its intended purpose has contributed significantly to the rise in o verdose deaths. Some individuals who abuse other narcotics ha ve turned to methadone because of its availabilit y.Methadone has been associated with disproportionate numbers of o verdose deaths relativ e to the frequency with which it is prescribed for pain. Methadone has been found to account for as much as a third of opioid-related o verdose deaths in volving single or multiple drugs in states that participated in the Drug Abuse W arning Network, which w as more than an y opioid other than o xycodone, despite representing <2% of opioid prescriptions outside of opioid treatment progr ams in the United States; further , methadone w as involved in twice as man y single-drug deaths as an y other prescription opioid (MMWR, 2016). Source: CD C, 2012. Methadone differs from most other opioids because of its long half -life, dela yed onset, narrow ther apeutic window , and inter actions with drugs such as alcohol and benzodiazepines. Methadone is less expensiv e than other opioids and is increasingly being prescribed as a cost -effectiv e alternativ e, partly due to pressure from insur ance companies. Abuse of Fentanyl Fentan yl is a synthetic opioid analgesic that is similar to morphine but is 50 to 100 times more potent. It is a schedule II prescription drug, and it is t ypically used to treat patients with sev ere pain or to manage pain after surgery . It is also sometimes used to treat patients with chronic pain who are ph ysically toler ant to other opioids. Fentan yl can be absorbed through the skin (fentan yl patch), b y IV injection, b y mouth (for breakthrough cancer pain), and intr anasally . There are two t ypes of fentan yl: Pharmaceutical fentan yl, which is primarily prescribed to manage acute and chronic pain associated with adv anced cancer1.A sharp increase has been noted in the number of fentan yl overdoses in recent y ears. Most of the increases in fentan yl deaths o ver the last three y ears do not in volve prescription fentan yl but are related to illicitly made fentan yl that is being mix ed with or sold as heroin \u2014with or without the users' knowledge\u2014 and increasingly as counterfeit pills. In July 2016, the DEA issued a new nation wide report indicating hundreds of thousands of counterfeit prescription pills ha ve been entering the U .S. drug mark et since 2014, some containing deadly amounts of fentan yl and fentan yl analogs. The current fentan yl crisis continues to expand in siz e and scope across the United States (CDC, 2016b).

Abuse of Buprenorphine (Subutex) and SuboxoneNonpharmaceutical fentan yl, which is illegally made, and is often mix ed with heroin and/or cocaine\u2014 with or without the user 's knowledge\u2014in order to increase the drug' s effect2.Buprenorphine (Subutex) combination of buprenorphine xone) are used to treat opioid dependence. alone and the combination of buprenorphine and nalo xone work to prev ent withdr awal symptoms when someone stops taking opioid drugs b y producing similar effects to these drugs. In recent y ears, buprenorphine has surpassed methadone as a drug of div ersion and abuse (Medline Plus, 2016). Subutex, which contains only buprenorphine, is intended for use at the beginning of treatment. Subo xone, which contains both buprenorphine and nalo xone (to decrease the potential for abuse b y injection), and is used in the maintenance treatment of opiate addiction. The National F orensic Labor atory Information S ystem (NFLIS) collects results from la w enforcement -encountered drug items submitted to and analyz ed by state and local forensic laboratories across the country . In contr ast to methadone, the number of buprenorphine reports in the y ear following its appro val to treat opioid dependence increased from 90 in 2003 (one y ear after it w as appro ved) to 10,537 in 2010. It has increased slowly each y ear since then, reaching a high of 11,992 in 2013 (CES AR, 2014). In 2013 the majorit y of buprenorphine reports were from the Northeast United States census region, while the W est had the lowest number (CES AR, 2014). Curbing Opioid Abuse Medicine and drug use is highly regulated b y the feder al government and the states to protect people from harm. R egulations require pharmaceutical companies to place warnings on packaging of O TC and prescribed medicines. F ederal and state regulations control who is able to prescribe medicines with a high risk for abuse. Medical tr aining institutions teach students to prescribe controlled substances and O TC medicines safely . Schools of pharmacy teach pharmacists to dispense medicines safely . Pharmaceutical boards regulate the pr actice of dispensing medicines (OHA, 2014). Many states require prescriber education on pain and the use of pharmaceutical medicines to control pain. States regulate the age at which individuals can legally purchase and consume alcohol. F ederal and state la ws establish penalties to control and punish infractions of la ws and regulations b y individuals (patients, prescribers, and pharmacists), institutions, corpor ations, and criminal organizations that promote and control drug tr ade. Yet all of these la ws and regulations ha ve not prev ented misuse, abuse, addiction, and overdoses due to the use of prescribed medicines, alcohol, and illegal drugs (OHA, 2014).Source: CD C.The increase in nonmedical use of pharmaceuticals suggests that previous prev ention measures\u2014such as pro vider and patient education and restrictions on the use of specific formulations\u2014ha ve not been adequate to curb widespread abuse and misuse. Giv en the societal burden of the problem, additional interv entions are needed, such as more systematic pro vider education, univ ersal use of state prescription drug monitoring progr ams b y providers, routine monitoring of insur ance claims information for signs of inappropriate use, and efforts b y providers and insurers to interv ene when patients use drugs inappropriately (MMWR, 2010). Preventing Diversion Diversion is the use of drugs for other than medically necessary or legal purposes or for nonmedical or not -medically -authoriz ed purposes. Div ersion in volves, but is not limited to , physicians who sell prescriptions to drug dealers or abusers, pharmacists who falsif y records and subsequently sell the drugs, emplo yees who steal from in ventory and falsif y orders to co ver illicit sales, prescription forgers, and individuals who commit armed robbery of pharmacies and drug distributors (DEA, n.d.). Surveys rev eal that div ersion of prescription drugs is endemic in communities. Div ersion takes place in man y contexts, most often when friends and relativ es share their prescription pain reliev ers. Fift y-four percent of those surv eyed in the United States reported the source of the pain reliev ers that they used nonmedically w as free from their family and friends (OHA, 2014). Under feder al law, all businesses that import, export, manufacture, or distribute controlled substances; all health professionals licensed to dispense, administer , or prescribe them; and all pharmacies authoriz ed to fill prescriptions must register with the DEA. R egistr ants must comply with regulatory requirements relating to drug securit y and recordk eeping. The DEA is obligated under international treaties to monitor the mo vement of licit controlled substances across U .S. borders and to issue import and export permits for that mo vement (DEA, n.d.).Almost all prescription drugs in volved in o verdoses originate from prescriptions; v ery few come from pharmacy theft. Howev er, once they are prescribed and dispensed, prescription drugs are frequently div erted to people using them without prescriptions. More than 3 out of 4 people who misuse prescription painkillers use drugs prescribed to someone else. Most prescription painkillers are prescribed b y primary care and internal medicine doctors and dentists, not specialists. About 20% of prescribers prescribe 80% of all prescription painkillers (CDC, 2013a). More than half of prescription drugs are obtained from a friend or relative. Source: NIDA, 2014 In addition to other drugs of abuse, toda y's illicit drug mark et offers an assortment of purely synthetic drugs, sometimes referred to as designer drugs. The term designer drugs in the context of drug abuse refers to substances chemically similar to and/or that mimic the drug-lik e effects of controlled substances. The term is often used synon ymously with club drugs , party drugs, and synthetic drugs. Designer drugs affect the centr al nervous system and can displa y stimulant, depressant, and hallucinogenic properties (Volkow, 2013). A large number of new unregulated substances are being abused for their psy choactiv e properties, often resulting in violent and unpredictable beha vior. This growing phenomenon is particularly challenging, first because of the speed with which rogue chemists can modif y existing drugs and mark et them. and second because of the ease with which the Internet allows for the sharing of information about and purchase of products such as \"spice\" and \"bath salts\" (V olkow, 2013). Prescription Drug Monitoring Programs Thirty-six states ha ve Prescription Drug Monitoring Progr ams (PDMP) that can help prescribers and pharmacists identif y high-risk patients who would benefit from early interv entions. CDC recommends that PDMPs focus their resources on high-risk patients and prescribers who clearly deviate from accepted medical pr actice in terms of prescription painkiller dosage, numbers of prescriptions for controlled substances, and proportion of doctor shoppers among their patients. CDC also recommends that PDMPs link to electronic health records systems so that PDMP information is better integr ated into healthcare providers' da y-to-da y practices (CDC, 2016b). Source: cdc.gov. New research funded b y the National Institute on Drug Abuse (NIDA) found that state implementation of PDMPs w as associated with a reduction in opioid-related o verdose deaths. The study also found PDMPs that monitored a greater numbers of drugs with abuse potential and updated their data more frequently had greater declines in opioid-related overdose deaths than progr ams without those char acteristics (NIDA, 2016b). Implementation of a PDMP w as link ed to a decrease of 1.12 opioid-related o verdose deaths per 100,000 population. A state with a progr am that monitored four or more drug schedules and updated their information at least weekly w as predicted to ha ve 1.55 fewer opioid-related o verdose deaths per 100,000 population annually than a state without a progr am (NIDA, 2016b). Providing Naloxone to Laypeople For man years, ha ve offered opioid o verdose prev ention services to la ypeople who might witness an o verdose, including people who use drugs, their families and friends, and service pro viders. Since 1996, an increasing number of progr ams pro vide la ypeople with tr h potentially fatal respir atory depression caused b y heroin and other opioids (Wheeler et al. , 2015). In July 2014, the Harm R eduction Coalition (HRC), a national adv ocacy and capacit y- building organization, surv eyed 140 managers of organizations in the United States known to pro vide nalo xone kits to la ypeople. Managers at 136 organizations completed the survey, reporting on the amount of nalo xone distributed, o verdose rev ersals b y bystanders, and other progr am data for 644 sites that were pro viding nalo xone kits to la ypeople as of June 2014. From 1996 through June 2014, surv eyed organizations pro vided nalo xone kits to 152,283 ypeople ypeople who might witness an opioid o verdose can help reduce opioid o verdose mortalit y (Wheeler et al. , 2015). Providing nalo xone kits to la ypeople reduces o verdose deaths, is safe, and is cost -effectiv e. U.S. and international health organizations recommend pro viding nalo xone kits to laypeople who might witness an opioid o verdose; to patients in substance use treatment progr ams; to people lea ving prison and jail; and as a component of responsible opioid prescribing (Wheeler et al. , 2015).Although the number pro viding nalo xone kits to la ypeople is increasing, in 2013, 20 states had no such organization, and 9 had less than 1 la yperson per 100,000 population who had receiv ed a nalo xone kit. Among these 29 states with minimal or no access to nalo xone kits for la ypeople, 11 had age- adjusted 2013 drug o verdose death r ates higher than the national median (Wheeler et al. , 2015). At their annual meeting in June 2016, the AMA adopted new policies that encour age physicians to co-prescribe nalo xone to patients at risk of an o verdose; promote timely and appropriate access to non-opioid and nonpharmacologic treatments for pain; and support efforts to delink pa yments to healthcare facilities with patient satisfaction scores relating to the ev aluation and management of pain (AMA, 2016a). The new nalo xone policies will promote increased access to the o verdose-rev ersing drug for friends and family members of patients at risk of o verdose. The policy also encour ages private and public pa yers to include all forms of nalo xone on their preferred drug lists and formularies with nominal or no cost sharing. The policy supports liabilit y protections for physicians and other authoriz ed healthcare professionals to prescribe, dispense, and administer nalo xone. Delegates called for policies to enable la w enforcement agencies to carry and administer nalo xone, as man y states ha ve done (AMA, 2016a). Probuphine: Fighting Opioid Dependence Medications lik e buprenorphine and methadone ha ve revolutioniz ed the treatment of people with opioid use disorder , including those with sev ere disorders (addiction). By controlling cr avings and withdr awal symptoms without producing a high, these medications enable the patient to engage in treatment and mak e healthier choices while balance is gradually restored in br ain circuits in volved in rew ard and self -control. In people with severe disorders, these circuits are greatly disrupted (NIDA, 2016c). One of the challenges with all addiction medications, howev er, is making sure patients adhere to their prescribed regimen. F or the medication to be effectiv e, the patient must take their prescription or show up daily at the clinic. This can be challenging for an yone managing life' s responsibilities, especially in times of stress. F ailing at this challenge can mean relapse, which ma y dela y reco very (NIDA, 2016c). In Ma y of 2016, the FDA appro ved a long- acting buprenorphine implant called Probuphine . This subdermal implant deliv ers a constant low dose of buprenorphine o ver six months, the first such tool in the treatment of opioid use disorder . The implant is appro ved for individuals with opioid dependence who ha ve already been treated with, and are medically stable on, existing or ally absorbed buprenorphine formulations. It is a valuable new ther apeutic tool for this subset of patients (NIDA, 2016c).Buprenorphine, which in numerous studies has been shown to significantly impro ve outcomes for patients, has previously only been a vailable in products that must be tak en daily. The Probuphine implant, created b y marrying buprenorphine to a polymer , deliv ers the drug steadily in the body at a low dose, eliminating the need for daily dosing (NIDA, 2016c). AMA Recommendations The American Medical Association acknowledges that opioid addiction is a national problem that has reached epidemic proportions. They urge ph ysicians to tak e the following steps to address opioid abuse (AMA, 2016b): Video (9:03) All on the Same Team: Managing Chronic Pain Patients on opioids and providers work to improve their quality of life.

Those tr ained within the traditional, W estern medical model include ph ysical and occupational ther apists, doctors of osteopath y, chiropr actors, psy chologists, mental health pr actitioners, ph ysiologists, and athletic tr ainers and kinesiologists, among others. Man y Western-tr ained pr actitioners are adding alternativ e techniques to their pr actices. Alternativ e practitioners mak e up an ev er larger piece of the pain management univ erse. Most are tr ained in what would be considered complementary and alternativ e medicine and many are being included in W estern medicine under the increasingly popular and effectiv e approach called integrative medicine . Alternativ e practices include tr aditional Chinese medicine, acupuncture, cognitiv e-beha vioral practices, meditation, h ypnother apy, massage therapy, and body -based pr actices such as y oga, T ai Chi, and F eldenkr ais, among others. Approaches o verlap and professions argue about who does what and ev en who can do what. F or example, ph ysical and occupational ther apists are using pain management techniques once ex clusiv ely in the domain of chiropr actors, acupuncturists, and doctors of osteopath y. Nurses and doctors are encour aging patients to use mindfulness meditation, yoga, and other alternativ e practices to manage pain. In almost ev ery profession, the amount and breadth of education and tr aining has increased, and with it man y inno vative approaches and pr actices are competing with the tr aditional, pain-medicine model. The development of interdisciplinary , integr ative pain management progr ams, which dr aw on the expertise of multiple disciplines, is perhaps one of the most encour aging dev elopments in the field of pain management. Interdisciplinary Pain Rehabilitation Interdisciplinary pain rehabilitation progr ams are becoming more common, especially for the treatment of chronic pain. A growing body of liter ature supports the immediate and long-term benefits of the interdisciplinary rehabilitation approach. In this model, healthcare professionals work from the same facilit y, with daily meetings about the patients' progress, sharing the same treatment vision and passing the same message to the patients (Kurklinsky et al. , 2016).In one such progr am at the Ma yo Clinic Comprehensiv e Pain Rehabilitation Center in Jackson ville, Florida, the o verall goal is to impro ve function in people with chronic pain. The physical ther apy component focuses on gener al reconditioning with gr aded exposure to activit y, gradual reduction of fear -avoidance beha viors, and incremental elimination of other pain beha viors. Daily ex ercise sessions include a morning stretch , which incorpor ates 15-20 minutes of whole-body activ e range of motion, gentle dynamic stretching, moder ate static stretching, balance, and coordination tr aining. Cardio and strength groups are also performed. During cardio group , each patient 's goal is to complete 20-30 minutes of moder ate conditioning activities within an age determined target heart rate zone followed b y 5-10 minutes of static stretching. During strength group , each patient uses free weights, resistance bands, or body weight resistance to complete a whole-body strengthening and stabilit y circuit (K urklinsky et al. , 2016). The occupational ther apy component focuses on the role of moder ation and balance in daily activities. The o verall goal is to increase functional independence and impro ve participation in life roles. Group lecture topics include home safet y and modification, body mechanics and ergonomics, cleaning and y ard work str ategies, cognitiv e strategies, driving, fall prev ention, self -care, shopping, time management, and v ocational tr aining. Each Frida y, the occupational ther apists lead a time management session for week end planning to help patients appropriately moder ate their schedule and balance activit y during their time a way from the structured progr am. Midw ay through the progr am, an O T meets with each patient to begin planning his or her da ys immediately after the progr am. There are also three individual biofeedback sessions during which patients learn diaphr agmatic breathing and muscle relaxation and how to utiliz e these str ategies during daily activit y and functional mobilit y (Kurklinsky et al. , 2016). A pain psy chologist leads up to three group ther apy sessions each da y. Discussion topics include anger , anxiet y, fear, apy, identif ying pain cy cles, coping with pain and depression, difficult -day planning, distr action, drug interv entions, forgiv eness, goal setting, grief, lifest yle changes, pain beha viors, perfectionism, personal responsibilit y, problems solving, relationships, relaxation, self -esteem, sleep , stress, and withdr awal. There are also weekly question and answer sessions for the group members with no scheduled topic and weekly sessions for family and friends to learn about the pain rehabilitation progr am and ask questions. There are also work groups for distr action and difficult -day planning, nutrition, posture, and pain rehabilitation progr am tools (K urklinsky et al., 2016).Throughout the three- week progr am, nurses serv e as patient care coordinators. They tak e the lead in medication management and tapering (under the direction of a ph ysician). With patient authorization, nurses in the progr am also communicate with primary and specialt y care pro viders outside of the pain rehabilitation team to assist with continuit y of care into the future (K urklinsky et al. , 2016). Physical and Occupational Therapy Physical and occupational ther apists (PT s and O Ts) have long been in volved in pain management. Starting in W orld W ar I, \"reconstruction aides\" began to dev elop their profession b y tending to soldiers on the battlefield and those returning from w ar. Since that time, PT s and O Ts have significantly expanded their scope of pr actice, education, and training. As mo vement specialists, they pla y a key role in the assessment and management of pain. Physical and occupational ther apists are particularly well-positioned to assume an educational role for patients related to health y lifest yles and ex ercise. They encour age a model of care based on health, which includes initiating and supporting beha vior change, optimal nutrition, weight reduction, reduced sedentary activit y, and increased pr actitioners, ther apists integr ate health education into practice, including initiating and supporting smoking cessation, impro ved sleep h ygiene, and stress management (Dean & Hansen, 2012). Physical and occupational ther apy gener ally in volves one-on-one sessions, which can include manual ther apy, movement analysis, or supportiv e technologies and equipment that assist the client in mobilizing and strengthening muscles, or impro ving motion in tendons, joints, and connectiv e tissue. P atient education pla ys a k ey role in rehabilitation therapy with emphasis on body mechanics and changing habits and patterns of mo vement that lead to pain and dysfunction. Physical and occupational ther apists pro vide expertise in the use of assistiv e devices, orthotics, br aces, as well as positioning devices, which designed to impro ve function, support areas of weakness, and reduce pain. P atients are referred to rehabilitation ther apy following surgery , strok e, accidents, and illness and for education and tr aining, with the goal of helping patients return to or ev en impro ve their prior lev el of function. In some states, a person can see a PT without a doctor 's referr al, a pr actice referred to as direct access .Clinical pr actice guidelines are becoming the standard of pr actice for ph ysical and occupational ther apists. In a review of guidelines for the treatment of low back pain, adherence to ph ysical ther apy clinical pr actice guidelines has been shown to pla y an important role in certain measures of healthcare utilization and costs. With a few exceptions, those patients with low back pain who were treated b y ther apists using accepted clinical pr actice guidelines had lower o verall healthcare utilization including fewer PT visits, shorter dur ation of care, fewer prescription medications, fewer ph ysician or emergency department visits and less use of adv anced imaging and injection procedures. Also, decreased costs ha ve been associated with prescription medications, surgical procedures, and total low back pain related costs for those patients with low back pain treated b y guideline- adherent ph ysical ther apy interv entions (Hanney et al. , 2016). Therapeutic Exercise Both PT s and O Ts mak e extensiv e use of ther apeutic ex ercise in the treatment of pain. Therapeutic ex ercise is an activ e treatment designed to address pain, maintain or impro ve strength and r ange of motion, increase blood flow , impro ve proprioception, and prev ent muscle guarding, spasms, and contr actures. Ex ercise progr ams directed b y a ph ysical or occupational ther apist are tailored to the individual patient, based on assessment of impairments, patient preference, and co-morbidities. Low back pain, neck pain, migr aine, and other musculosk eletal disorders are 4 of the top 10 causes of disabilit y worldwide (Lancet, 2015). By far , the most common reason for a referr al to ph ysical ther apy is for low back pain, and often the pain has no structur ally identifiable cause. Ex ercise ther apy has been shown to be particularly effectiv e for patients with low back pain. R esults indicate that ex ercise ther apy decreases pain intensit y, alleviates disabilit y, and impro ves ph for long period (eg, 12-month followup) (Ishak et al. , 2016). Meta- analyses ha ve also been conducted on the effectiv eness of ex ercise as low back pain treatment. In 2006 researchers systematically reviewed trunk strengthening ex ercise and revealed that this ex ercise can alleviate pain and impro ve functions more effectiv ely than aerobics and other ex ercises. Others ha ve reported that progressiv e resistance ex ercise is effectiv e and safe for patients experiencing muscle force deficiency and pain-related problems and that ex ercise impro ves the abilit y of patients to perform daily life activities (Ishak et al. , 2016).TENS ApparatusProprioceptiv e training, in which passiv e and activ e sensory feedback ex ercises are used to impro ve motor function, ma y be more effectiv e than tr aditional ex ercise in the treatment of low back and neck pain. Proprioception relates to our conscious a wareness of where our body and limbs are in space. Proprioception also has unconscious components, for example it is associated with the control of posture, balance, and muscle tone. In a systemic review of proprioceptiv e training techniques, researchers identified fiv e main categories of proprioceptiv e-based interv entions: For patients with musculosk eletal conditions such as chronic neck pain, knee ligament reconstruction, ankle injury , and osteoarthritis, tr aining consisted of activ e multi-joint or whole body mo vement as well as whole body balance tr aining. Among the musculosk eletal conditions, proprioceptiv e training pro ved most beneficial for impro ving function in knee osteoarthritis, leading to significant functional impro vement (Aman et al. , 2015). Transcutaneous Electrical Stimulation Transcutaneous electrical nerv e stimulation (TENS) is widely used all around the world for relieving a v ariety of painful conditions. Controlled clinical trials ha ve clearly demonstr ated that TENS has a specific antalgic effect (reliev es pain), but the intrinsic mechanism remains largely unknown. F or this reason, clinically TENS is largely used b y trial and error , and the optimal setting of stimulation par ameters is still a matter of debate (Buonocore et al., movement/balance tr passiv e and activ e movements, multi-joint activ e movements, and whole body balance tr aining)1. Passive movement tr aining (passiv e motion appar atus focused either on single- joint or multi-joint mo Somatosensory stimulation tr ation of a single segment, thermal stimulation, multi-somatosensory stimulation, magnetic stimulation, electrical stimulation, and acupuncture)3. Somatosensory discrimination tr aining (activ e explor ation of objects with the hand, tactile discrimination of textures, wrist or ankle joint position discrimination, and wrist joint v elocit y discrimination tasks)4. Combined/multiple system tr aining (multiple components of the three main categories mentioned abo ve or multi-sensory approaches) (Aman et al. , 2015)5.Transcutaneous Electrical Nerve Stimulator. Wi kipedia.The term TENS co vers a v ariety of techniques that use electrical stimulation of the skin for pain control. HF- TPNS (high-frequency tr anscutaneous peripher al nerv e stimulation) is a subt ype of TENS , where the trunk of a peripher al nerv e is electrically stimulated at high frequency using surface electrodes. Accur ate placement of electrodes is commonly considered v ery important for pain relief (Buonocore et al. , 2013). TENS has been shown to reliev e pain effectiv ely in cases of musculosk eletal pain, arthritic pain, low back pain, neuropathic pain, and post oper ative pain. Some studies ha ve reported that the application of TENS impro ves motor function (Suh et al. , 2015). Therapeutic Ultrasound Therapeutic ultr asound is among the most commonly used ph ysical modalities for treating soft tissue injuries and pain. It in volves the use of ultr asonic sound w aves applied directly to a patient 's skin, which causes the underlying tissue to vibr ate and mildly heat, impro ving blood flow to the affected tissue. It is deliv ered using a hand-held, rounded wand in either of two modes: (1) continuous mode, in which the deliv ery of ultr asound is nonstop throughout the treatment period; and (2) pulsed mode, in which the deliv ery of ultrasound is intermittently interrupted (Ebadi et al. , 2012). The ther apeutic effects of asound are classified as thermal and nonthermal. Ultr asonic energy causes soft tissue molecules to vibr ate from exposure to the acoustic w ave. This increased molecular motion gener ates frictional heat and consequently increases tissue temper ature. This thermal effect is thought to cause changes in nerv e conduction v elocit y, increase in enzymatic activit changes in contr actile activit y of sk eletal muscles, increase in collagen tissue extensibilit y,* increase in local blood flow , increase in pain threshold, and reduction in muscle spasm (Ebadi et al. , 2012). * Extensibility means the ability of muscles to be stretched to their normal resting length and beyond, to a limited degree. The nonthermal mechanical effects are proposed to be achiev ed through the application of pulsed, low -intensit y ther apeutic ultr asound. A number of studies using animal models of cartilage injury to ev aluate the effect of ther apeutic ultr asound on the r ate of cartilage degener ation ha ve shown benefits. In some of these in vitro studies, pulsed low -intensit y therapeutic ultr asound\u2014 with tempor al average intensities achiev able using devices widely available in ph ysical ther apy practice\u2014has been used with beneficial effects on cartilage repair (MacInt yre et al. , 2013).In pulsed ther apeutic ultr asound, such as that used in bone healing systems, has been used. V ery-low-intensit y pulsed ultr asound slowed progression of cartilage degener ation in the guinea pig model of idiopathic osteoarthritis\u2014 particularly in those guinea pigs with early r ather than established degener ation. The studies in the animal models suggest that v ery-low-intensit y pulsed ultr asound could stimulate the repair of injured cartilage and, if applied at early stages, ma y slow the progression of knee osteoarthritis (MacInt yre et al. , 2013). Heat/Cold Therapy The application of heat and cold to reduce pain or promote comfort is a common interv ention. Howev er, there are few studies in vestigating the impact of heat or cold on pain or function. A meta- analysis of heat and cold for low back pain concluded that continued intermittent use of heat (o ver a 5-da y period) reduced pain intensit y and impro ved function. Cold ther apy includes cold packs, cold baths, v apocoolant spr ays, cold compression, continuous-flow cold ther apy, and ice massage. Cold alters the pain threshold, reduces local swelling, decreases tissue metabolism and bleeding, and decreases muscle spasm and spasticit y. Cold ma y be contr aindicated in patients who are h ypersensitiv e to cold (as in Raynaud' s phenomenon), ha ve mark ed hypertension, ha ve arteriosclerosis, or ha ve diminished circulation. Heat can usually be initiated 48 hours following an oper ation or injury , and is commonly used in combination with other treatments. Thermal agents are used to apply heat superficially or as deep-heating applications. Superficial methods include hot packs, w arm whirlpools, and par affin. Deep heat, such as ultr asound, can increase the temper ature of the tissues 3 to 5 centimeters in depth. Heat has the adv antage of inducing relaxation and decreasing joint stiffness, muscle spasm, and guarding. It assists in increasing r ange of motion and increases superficial circulation. Dry Needling Dry needling is the penetr ation of a needle through the skin without introduction of an y drug (Chou et al. , 2012). Dry needling uses a thin, flexible needle to stimulate underlying myofascial trigger points,* and muscular and connectiv e tissues for the management of neuro-musculosk eletal pain and mo vement impairments. Dry needling is used b y physical therapists to treat pain and reduce or restore impairments of body structure and function (APTA, 2013). *Trigger point: a hyperirritable nodule or knot in the fascia surrounding the muscle.Although there is strong evidence to support the use of dry needling in the treatment of various neuromuscular pain syndromes, the American Ph ysical Ther apy Association and several state boards of ph ysical ther apy have narrowed their definition of dry needling to an \"intr amuscular \" procedure. More specifically , these professional organizations ha ve equated the procedure of dry needling with the terms intramuscular manual therapy (IMT) or trigger point dry needling (TDN) (Dunning et al. , 2014). In June 2016 the American Medical Association adopted a policy directing that ph ysical therapists and other non-ph ysicians pr acticing dry needling should\u2014 at a minimum\u2014ha ve standards that are similar to the ones for tr aining, certification, and continuing education that exist for acupuncture. \"Lax regulation and nonexistent standards surround this invasive practice. F or patients' safet y, practitioners should meet standards required for licensed acupuncturists and ph ysicians, \" announced AMA board member R ussell W .H. Kridel (AMA, 2016c). Manual Therapy Manual ther apy is an important and specializ ed area within man y professions, particularly physical ther apy, osteopath y, and chiropr actic. Manual ther apists use a v ariety of nonsurgical techniques directed to the patient 's spine and extremities for the purpose of assessing, diagnosing, and treating v arious symptoms and conditions. Manual ther apy techniques can be categoriz ed into four major groups: (1) manipulation (thrust manipulation), (2) mobilization (non-thrust manipulation), (3) static stretching, and (4) muscle energy techniques. The definition and purpose of manual ther apy varies across healthcare professionals (Clar et al. , 2014). Manual ther apists mobiliz e areas of the spine or other painful joints using their hands, forearms, or elbows to apply a force with a ther apeutic intent. Manual ther apy approaches and techniques include massage, joint mobilization/manipulation, m yofascial release, nerv e manipulation, str ain/counterstr ain, and acupressure (Smith, 2007). Spinal manipulation and mobilization are commonly used treatment modalities for back pain, particularly b y physical ther apists, osteopaths, and chiropr actors. Their use has been steadily increasing in the W est. F or example, in the United States, 33% of people with low back pain are treated b y a chiropr actor. A United Kingdom-based study surv eyed the use of chiropr actic/osteopath y services for back pain in a r andomly selected sample of adults aged 18 to 64 y ears living in four counties of England. Of the respondents with back pain, 13.4% had consulted with osteopaths or chiropr actic pr actitioners (Clar et al. , 2010 review of scientific evidence on manual ther apies for a r ange of conditions concluded that spinal manipulation or mobilization ma y be helpful for sev eral conditions in addition to back pain, including migr aine and neck -related headaches, neck pain, upper - and lower -extremit y joint conditions, and whiplash- associated disorders. The review also identified a number of conditions for which spinal manipulation or mobilization appears not to be helpful (eg, asthma, h ypertension, menstrual pain) or the evidence is (NCCIH, 2012). Mobilization Mobilization is a manual ther apy technique applied to painful or restricted joints that uses low gr ade, low v elocit y, small or large amplitude passiv e movement and neuromuscular techniques within a patient 's range of motion. Mobilization is t ypically used b y physical and occupational ther apists and chiropr actors, often in conjunction with patient education, heat/cold ther apy, and ther apeutic ex ercise. One such mobilization technique w as dev eloped b y Geoffrey Maitland, an A ustralian physiother apist who dev eloped a system of manual ther apy for the treatment of joint and back pain. In this technique, joint mobilization is gently applied b y hand following a thorough and detailed subjectiv e and objectiv e physical examination. Mobilization in volves a nearly imperceptible (Gr ade I) or slightly more forceful (Gr ades II, III, and IV) oscillation of the affected joint. The gentle oscillations ma y have an inhibitory effect on the perception of painful stimuli b y repetitiv ely stimulating mechanoreceptors that block nociceptiv e path ways at the spinal cord or br ainstem lev els. These non-stretch motions help mo ve syno vial fluid to impro ve nutrition to the cartilage (K umar et al. , 2012). Gentle mechanical force during mobilization ma y include breaking up of adhesions, realigning collagen, or increasing fiber glide when specific mo vements stress specific parts of the capsule. Mobilization techniques ma y increase or maintain joint mobilit y by inducing biologic changes in syno vial fluid (K umar et al. , 2012). Mobilization has an effect on blood flow in the v essels supplying the nerv e fibers and synovial fluid surrounding damaged, a vascular articular cartilage. This facilitates an exchange of fluid, which increases v enous dr ainage and disperses chemical irritants. Mobilization causes a rev ersal of the ischemia-edema-inflammation cy cle and reduces joint effusion. It also reliev es pain b y reducing the pressure o ver the nerv e endings (K umar et al., 2012).Manipulation The v elocit y of the technique has been the subject of great debate. The merits of high- velocit y techniques (thrust techniques) ha ve been compared to low -velocit y techniques (non-thrust techniques). Some ha ve described high- velocit y techniques as manipulation and low -velocit y techniques as mobilization while others consider these terms synon ymous (Smith, 2007). It is thought that spinal manipulation affects muscles, tendons, ligaments, and fascia, altering orientation or position of anatomic structures, unbuckling some structures, releasing entr apped structures, or disrupting adhesions. In 2007 guidelines, the American College of Ph ysicians and the American P ain Societ y included spinal manipulation as one of several treatment options for pr actitioners to consider when low back pain does not impro ve with self -care. A 2010 Agency for Healthcare R esearch and Qualit y (AHRQ) report noted that complementary health ther apies, including spinal manipulation, offer additional options to con ventional treatments, which often ha ve limited benefit in managing back and neck pain. The AHRQ analysis also found that spinal manipulation w as more effectiv e than placebo and as effectiv e as medication in reducing low -back pain intensit y (NCCIH, 2013). Complementary, Alternative, and Integrative Therapies Complementary , alternativ e, and integr ative health approaches are often used to treat or manage disorders or symptoms associated with acute and chronic pain. Common complementary health approaches include mind and body interv entions such as meditation, spinal manipulation, y oga, massage, tai chi, and acupuncture. A v ariety of natur al products, including herbs, dietary supplements, and prebiotic or probiotic products are also commonly used (NCCIM, 2016a). The most current and comprehensiv e picture of Americans' use of complementary health approaches has been dev eloped under the National Center for Complementary and Integr ative Health (NCCIH) through two National Health Interview Surv eys (NHIS) conducted b y the National Center for Health Statistics at the CDC in 2002, 2007, and 2012. The surv eys showed: Non-vitamin, non-miner al dietary supplements were the most commonly used complementary health approach at each of the three time points. Whether used independently or as a part of other approaches, deep-breathing exercises were the second most commonly used complementary health approach.The use of y oga, tai chi, and qi gong increased linearly o ver the three time points, beginning at 5.8% in 2002, 6.7% in 2007, and 10.1% in 2012. Y oga w as the most commonly used of these three approaches at all three time points. There w as a small but significant linear increase in the use of homeopathic treatment, acupuncture, and naturopath y. The use of chiropr actic care or chiropr actic and osteopathic manipulation w as the fourth most commonly used approach. Meditation w as used b y 7.6% of adults in 2002, 9.4% in 2007, and 8.0% in 2012, keeping it among the top fiv e most commonly used approaches for each time point. Ayurveda, biofeedback, guided imagery h ypnosis, and energy healing ther apy had a consistently low prev alence and had no significant changes across the three time points (Clark e et al, 2015). 10 Most Common Complementary Health Approaches Among Adults\u20142012 *Dietary supplements other than vitamins and minerals. Source: Clarke TC, Black LI, Stussman BJ, Barnes PM, Nahin RL. Trends in the use of complementary health approaches among adults: United States, 2002-2012. National health statistics reports; no 79. Hyattsville, MD: National Center for Health Statistics, 2015. In the United States, more than 30% of adults and about 12% of children use healthcare approaches dev eloped outside of mainstream W estern, or con ventional, medicine. When describing these approaches, people often use alternative and complementary interchangeably , but the two terms refer to different concepts: If a non-mainstream pr actice is used together with con ventional medicine, it is considered complementary . If a non-mainstream pr actice is used in place of con ventional medicine, it is considered alternativ e. True alternativ e medicine is uncommon. Most people who usenon-mainstream approaches use them along with con ventional treatments. (NCCIH, 2016b) Complementary ther apies differ from W estern medicine in at least four w ays: Integrative Pain Management Integrative healthcare brings con ventional and complementary approaches together in a coordinated w ay. Researchers are currently exploring the potential benefits of integr ative health in a v ariety of situations, including pain management for military personnel and veterans, relief of symptoms in cancer patients and surviv ors, and progr ams to promote health y beha (NCCIH, and integr ative medicine pro vide patient -centered care, addressing physical, emotional, mental, social, spiritual, and en vironmental influences that affect a person' s health. They use the most appropriate interv entions from an arr ay of disciplines to heal illness and help people regain and maintain optimal health. Because integr ative medicine is that emplo ys multiple modalities , as opposed to an isolated complementary ther apy, studying outcomes is more challenging than ev aluating an isolated pharmaceutic or al. , 2013). Integr ative medicine is a popular approach to pain management, although for a large, structured healthcare organization, integr ating div erse pr actices can be challenging. Healthcare organizations must balance supply and demand for services as well as combine the integr ative medicine progr am into the established culture of a large hospital (Nate et al., 2015). In an effort to capture data on patient -reported outcomes in integr ative medicine, a number of leading clinics ha ve collabor ated to form the first pr actice-based research network in the field: the Br avewell Integr ative Medicine R aveNet). BraveNet's initial project in volved 4182 patients seeking care at nine clinical sites. The data confirmed the high utilization of integr ative medicine b y chronic pain patients and led to a Study on Integr ative Medicine T reatment Approaches for P ain (SIMT AP). In this study , researchers reported the impact of a six -month integr ative approach on chronic pain and a number of other related patient -reported outcome measures (Abr ams et al. , 2013).They are often not co vered b y health insur ance pro viders. 1. There is limited, but growing, scientific evidence about their safet y and effectiv eness.2. They view the patient as a whole ( holistically ). 3. They view the body as more than the sum of its parts . 4.In the SIMT AP study , practitioners at each of the sites devised treatment plans for participating chronic pain patients. All Br aveNet sites include integr ative physicians, acupuncturists, mindfulness instructors, and y oga instructors; some also incorpor ate massage ther apists, manual medicine ther apists, fitness and mo vement dieticians and nutritionists, psy chologists, healing touch ther apists, and other energy practitioners. The results of this study suggest that the tailored, multimodal approach to treating chronic pain that combined con ventional and complementary ther apies impro ves qualit y of life and reduces pain, stress, and depressiv e symptoms (Abr ams et al. , 2013). How complementary and integr ative ther apies affect the nerv ous system and other physiologic systems such as organs and tissues, remains understudied. Such studies are challenging for both the complementary and integr ative health and the research communities. Nev ertheless, recent adv ances in genomics, neuroscience, stem cells, , neuroimaging, and computational modeling offer ex cellent resources and opportunities for inno vative studies of complementary health approaches (NCCIH, 2016a). For the treatment of chronic pain among activ e-dut y military personnel and v eterans, the National Center on Complementary and Integr ative Health (NCCIH), the U .S. Department of Veterans Affairs and other agencies are sponsoring research to see whether integr ative approaches can help patients with chronic pain. NCCIH-funded studies are testing the effects of adding mindfulness meditation, self -hypnosis, or other complementary approaches to pain management progr ams for v eterans. The goal is to help patients feel and function better and reduce their need for pain medicines that can ha ve serious side effects (NCCIH, 2016b). Some cancer treatment centers are using integr ative healthcare progr ams such as acupuncture and meditation to help manage symptoms and side effects for patients who are receiving con ventional cancer treatment. Although research on the potential v alue of these integr ative progr ams is in its early stages, some NCCIH-funded studies ha ve had promising results: Cancer patients who receiv e integr ative ther apies while in the hospital ha ve less pain and anxiet y. Massage ther apy may lead to short -term impro vements in pain and mood in patients with adv anced cancer . Yoga ma y reliev e the persistent fatigue that some women experience after breast cancer treatment. (NCCIH, 2016b) A growing body of evidence supports the efficacy and safet y of non-drug and complementary health approaches to reduce pain and increase patients' coping abilit y and gener al well-being. Man y of these techniques ha ve the potential to reduce theneed for costly pain medications with harmful side effects. A t a minimum, pro viders should ha ve a basic understanding of the scientific evidence on complementary health approaches so that patients will not be reluctant to disclose their use. Non-drug interv entions for pain management introduced early in the course of an illness are more lik ely to succeed because they can be learned and pr acticed b y patients while they ha ve sufficient strength and energy . Patients and their families should be giv en information about and encour aged to try sev eral strategies, and to select one or more mind-body techniques for regular use. Mind and Body Practices Mind-body techniques (also called cognitive/behavioral techniques ) focus on the interactions among the br ain, mind, body , and beha vior, with the intent of using the mind to affect ph ysical function and promote health. The concept that the mind is important in the treatment of illness is integr al to the healing approaches of tr aditional Chinese medicine (T CM) and A yurvedic medicine,* which are both more than two thousand y ears old (NCCIH, 2016b). *Ayurvedic medicine is a healing system from India emphasizing balance among body, mind, and spirit. Mind-body techniques require that patients understand the information and instructions involved; therefore, these techniques are not appropriate for patients with significant cognitiv e impairment. Cognitiv e ther apies require cooper ation and pr actice and are thus contraindicated for use with patients who are uncooper ative, unable, or un willing to practice the necessary beha viors. Mind and body pr actices include a large and div erse group of procedures and techniques administered or taught b y a tr ained pr actitioner or teacher . The 2012 National Health Interview Surv ey showed that y oga, chiropr actic and osteopathic manipulation, meditation, and massage ther apy are among the most popular mind and body pr actices used b y adults. The popularit y of y oga has grown dr amatically in recent y ears, with almost twice as many U.S. adults pr acticing y oga in 2012 as in 2002 (NCCIH, 2016b). Other mind and body pr actices include acupuncture, relaxation techniques (eg, breathing exercises, guided imagery , progressiv e muscle relaxation), tai chi, qi gong, healing touch, hypnother apy, and mo vement ther apies (eg, F eldenkr The amount of research on mind and body approaches v aries widely depending on the practice. F or example, researchers ha ve done man y studies on acupuncture, y oga, spinal manipulation, and meditation, but there ha ve been fewer studies on some other pr actices (NCCIH, 2016b).Chiropractic Treatment A chiropractor demonstrating an adjustment on the patient's thoracic spine.

F or example, researchers ha ve done man y studies on acupuncture, y oga, spinal manipulation, and meditation, but there ha ve been fewer studies on other pr actices (NCCIH, 2016b). Chiropractic Medicine Chiropr actic is a healthcare profession that focuses on the relationship between the body' s structure\u2014mainly the spine\u2014 and its functioning. Although pr actitioners ma y use a v ariety of treatment approaches, they primarily perform adjustments (manipulations) to the spine or other parts of the body with the goal of correcting alignment problems, alleviating pain, impro ving function, and supporting the body' s natur al abilit y to heal itself (NCCIH, 2012). In the United States, chiropr actic is often considered a complementary health approach. According to the 2007 National Health Interview Surv ey (NHIS), which included a comprehensiv e surv ey of the use of complementary health approaches b y Americans, about 8% of adults and nearly 3% of children had receiv ed chiropr actic or osteopathic manipulation in the past 12 months (NCCIH, 2012). Massage Therapy Massage is a centuries-old healing art, pr acticed in ancient China, Japan, India, the Ar abic nations, Egypt, Greece, and R ome. Massage is sometimes considered a relaxation ther apy because that is one of its major effects. Massage therapy , one of the complementary and alternativ e treatments, is defined as a ther apeutic manipulation using the hands or a mechanical device that includes numerous specific and gener al techniques often used in sequence, such as effleur age (stroking), petrissage (kneading), and percussion. It ma y be the earliest and most primitiv e tool used to impro ve pain. The most ancient references to the use of massage come from China (circa 2700 B .C.). Common t ypes of massage therapy include S wedish massage, Shiatsu, R olfing, reflex ology, myofascial ther , 2013). In gener al, massage ther apists press, rub , and otherwise manipulate the muscles and soft tissues of the body . They use massage not only to reliev e pain but also to rehabilitate sports injuries; reduce stress, anxiet y, and depression; increase relaxation; and aid gener al well-being. Massage is effectiv e in gener al pain management because it mechanically assists in v enous and lymphatic flow , impro ves skin integrit y and mobilit y, desensitiz es tissue, and pro vides comfort and psy chological support. Massage ma y be used to stretch muscles and is gener ally used in combination with other treatments. Massage can also be helpful for older adults. Nurse researchers who reviewed 21 studies on massage in elders found that slow -strok e back massage and hand massage significantly increased relaxation across all care settings (Harris & Richards, 2010). Massage has pro ved effectiv e in reducing pain, anxiet y, and tension after cardio vascular surgery . In a study at Ma yo Clinic, patients were r andomiz ed either to receiv e a massage or to ha ve quiet relaxation time following surgery . Those who receiv ed massage ther apy had significantly less pain, anxiet y, and tension than the control group (Br aun et al. , 2012). Burn victims suffer some of the most sev ere ph ysical and psy chological pain imaginable. Turkish researchers found that massage ther apy reduced pain, itching, and anxiet y levels in adolescents in the burn unit of a large univ ersity hospital. Massage ther apy reduced all three symptoms from the first da y of the study until the last (P arlak et al. , 2010). Researchers in Spain studied the effects of massage combined with m yofascial release therapy* on patients diagnosed with fibrom yalgia. P atients were r andomiz ed to receiv e either the massage-m yofascial release ther apy or a sham treatment during 20 weekly sessions. Immediately after treatment and 1 month later , the researchers found that anxiet y levels, qualit y of sleep , pain, and qualit y of life were impro ved in the experimental group (Castro- S\u00e1nchez et al. , 2011). *Myofascial release therapy is a type of physiotherapy requiring special training that aims to release myofascial restrictions at the sites of certain painful points called trigger points. A 2010 AHRQ evidence report \u2014which summariz ed, critically appr aised, and compared the evidence on clinical benefits, costs, and harms associated with use of complementary and integr ative medicine and other ther apies for the treatment of adults with low back, neck, and thor acic pain\u2014found that massage w as superior to placebo or no treatment in reducing pain and disabilit y immediately post treatment only in subjects with acute/subacute but not in subjects with chronic low back pain (AHRQ , 2014).Monastic Practitioner of Meditation Phra Ajan Wi kimedia Commons.Massage as: Significantly better than relaxation or ph ysical ther apy in reducing chronic nonspecific low back pain intensit y but not r ange of motion, immediately after the treatment Better than no treatment in reducing immediate-term post treatment pain intensit y in subjects with chronic or unknown dur ation of nonspecific pain Better than placebo in reducing neck pain intensit y immediately after the treatment in subjects with acute/subacute or unknown dur ation of nonspecific pain Not different from placebo in impro ving well-being or r ange of motion in subjects with chronic pain (AHRQ , 2014) Meditation Meditation refers to a group of techniques rooted in ancient religious and spiritual tr aditions. It is used to increase calm, promote relaxation, impro ve psy chological balance, cope with illness, or enhance o verall health and well-being. P eople also use meditation for v arious health problems, including anxiet y, pain, depression, stress, insomnia, and ph ysical or emotional symptoms associated with chronic illness and their treatment. Mindfulness meditation is one of the most studied and practiced forms of meditation in America. Pioneered at the Univ ersity of Massachusetts Medical School' s Stress Reduction Clinic in 1979 b y Jon K abat-Zinn, mindfulness-based stress reduction (MBSR) meditation has been shown to be effectiv e in reducing depression and anxiet y, both known to influence pain. Previous research has shown that mindfulness meditation helps reliev e pain, but researchers ha ve been unclear about how the pr actice induces pain relief \u2014specifically , if meditation is associated with the release of natur ally occurring opiates. R esults from a new study , funded in part b y the NCCIH, demonstr ate that mindfulness meditation does not rely on the endogenous opioid activit y to reduce pain, which is an important consider ation for using meditation to treat chronic pain.In this study , conducted b y researchers at W ake Forest School of Medicine and Cincinnati Children' s Hospital Medical Center , researchers recorded pain reports in 78 health y adults during meditation or a non-meditation control in response to painful heat stimuli and intravenous administr ation of the opioid antagonist nalo that blocks the transmission of opioid activit y) or placebo saline. P articipants were r andomiz ed to one of four treatment groups: (1) meditation plus nalo xone; (2) control plus nalo xone; (3) meditation plus saline; or (4) control plus saline. P eople in the control groups were instructed to \"close y our ey es and relax until the end of the experiment \" (NCCIH, 2016c). Researchers found that participants who meditated during saline administr ation had significantly lower pain intensit y and unpleasantness r atings compared to those who did not meditate while receiving saline. Importantly , data from the meditation plus nalo xone group showed that nalo xone did not block meditation' s pain-relieving effects. No significant differences in reductions of pain intensit y or pain unpleasantness were seen between the meditation plus nalo xone and the meditation plus saline groups. P articipants who meditated during nalo xone administr ation also had significantly greater reductions in pain intensit y and unpleasantness than the control groups (NCCIH, 2016c). These findings demonstr ate that mindfulness meditation reduces pain independent of opioid neurotr ansmitter mechanisms. The researchers noted that because opioid and non- opioid mechanisms of pain relief inter act synergistically , the results of this study suggest that combining mindfulness-based and pharmacologic/non-pharmacologic pain-relieving approaches that rely on opioid signaling ma y be particularly effectiv e in treating pain (NCCIH, 2016c). Hypnotherapy In hypnother apy a patient attempts to enter into a tr ance-lik e state in order to cope better with complaints such as pain, anxiet y, and stress b y activ ely div erting their attention tow ards relaxing thoughts. Katja Boehm, Markus Horneber and the CAM-Cancer Consortium Hypnother apy involves the power of suggestion b y a hypnother apist or b y the patients themselv es. Hypnotic techniques ha ve proven to be useful for different kind of pain\u2014 especially pain associated with burns, cancer , invasive medical procedures, headaches, musculosk eletal conditions, irritable bowel syndrome, and fibrom yalgia (Ardigo et al. , 2016). Hypnother apy may help reduce pain, decrease anxiet y, and impro ve immune function. It o verlaps with guided imagery and visualization, creating an altered state of awareness. Hypnosis enhances the abilit y to focus attention to the ex clusion of other stimuli. It ma y take seconds to minutes to achiev e entr ance to a h ypnotic state.The pr actice of self -hypnosis has been shown in studies to be an important element in the long-term control of chronic pain. Self -hypnosis can be taught to the patient as a tool to modif y beha vior regarding nociceptiv e perception. It allows patients to tak e an activ e part in their own pain management using personal resources and experiences (Ardigo et al. , 2016). Hypnosis is thought to be beneficial for: Decreasing perioper ative pain Reducing analgesic and sedativ Decreasing post oper ative anxiet y Impro ving patient satisfaction and mood (Ardigo et al. , 2016) Hypnosis usually requires a tr ained professional, but ev en then it ma y not work for all patients, perhaps because of the social stigma associated with its use. Howev er, the efficacy of h ypnosis in relieving pain has been shown in cancer patients (Boehm & Horneber , 2016), burned children (Ba yat et al. , 2010), in adults with chronic and acute pain, and in older hospitaliz ed adults (Ardigo et al. , 2016). Biofeedback Biofeedback-assisted relaxation uses an external device to help the patient learn to relax specific muscle groups. Applying biofeedback requires special equipment and clinical training. R elaxation techniques ma y prove beneficial b y reducing muscular arousal and distracting the patient from painful sensations. These techniques also reduce anxiet y and increase the patient 's sense of control. Biofeedback is a popular interv ention alone or within cognitiv e-beha vioral or multidisciplinary pain treatments. Biofeedback is a procedure in which patients' bodily responses, such as muscle tension, heart r ate, or skin temper ature, are monitored and reported to the patient through an auditory or visual modalit y. In electrom yographic feedback (EMG-FB), one of the most common t ypes of feedback, patients learn to control and to alleviate their muscle tension (Glombiewski et al. , 2013). Biofeedback is often called a \"psy choph ysiologic interv ention, \" although its mechanisms than ph ysiologic. The effectiv eness of EMG biofeedback is mediated b y cognitiv e changes, such as increases in self -efficacy and coping str ategies induced through biofeedback tr aining, r ather than primarily b y learned ph ysiologic control (Glombiewski et al., 2013).Electroencephalogr aphic feedback (EEG-FB) is referred to as \"neurofeedback\" or \"EEG biofeedback. \" EEG-FB records and reports back EEG w aves. Patients are able to learn to influence ev oked potentials and ev ent-related potentials, and slow cortical and EEG frequencies (Glombiewski et al. , 2013). Biofeedback has been found to be beneficial in the rehabilitation of headache and, in some studies, of chronic back pain and sev eral other pain disorders (eg, temporomandibular or TMJ disorders). Findings on low back pain, howev er, show little to no impro vement. A meta- analysis of the efficacy of biofeedback in fibrom yalgia found that EMG-BFB w as effectiv e for the short -term reduction of pain intensit y in fibrom yalgia patients (Glombiewski et al. , 2013). Music Therapy Music ther apy dates back to Aristotle and Plato . In 1944 in the United States, Michigan State Univ ersity offered the first music -therapy degree progr am worldwide (Schmid & Ostermann, 2010). Sedating or soothing music is instrumental, rh ythmic, and 60 to 80 beats per minute. In much of the research, musical pieces are selected from fiv e types of music: synthesiz er, harp , piano , orchestr a, or slow jazz. Two types of music interv entions are distinguished: liv e music ther apy and recorded music. In live music ther apy a tr ained music ther apist pla ys music and applies ther apeutic techniques to reach a ther apeutic goal. One of these techniques is known as music entrainment , in which the music ther apist first uses music to match the patient 's physiologic and emotional states and then gr adually changes the music to modif y the patient 's state. R ecorded music, on the other hand, implies listening to prerecorded music selected b y a music ther apist or b y patients themselv es, pro vided they are old enough to do so (v an der Heijden et al. , 2015). Research indicates that music ther apy can be effectiv e in reducing both chronic and acute pain in children and adults. A review of r andomiz ed clinical trials found that music ther apy significantly reduced pain, anxiet y, and distress in children undergoing orthopedic, cardiac, and da y surgery procedures (v an der Heijden et al. , 2015). Music also reduced pain, anxiet y, and muscle tension in children during burn dressing changes (T an et al. , 2010). Effectiv e music ther apy requires a professional music ther apist who can tailor the interv ention to the individual patient. Music ma y accompan y other mind-body techniques such as guided imagery , gentle massage, or bodywork. Home-based music progr ams are gaining importance for sev erely impaired or older adults who are unable to attend da ycare centers where music is pro vided (Schmid & Ostermann, 2010).Traditional Chinese Medicine Traditional Chinese medicine (TCM) is a holistic medical system for diagnosis, prevention, and treatment of diseases. It has been an integr al part of Asian cultures for thousands of y ears. T CM uses ther apies such as acupuncture, massage, and herbal medicine and is char acteriz ed by its underpinning theoretical guide\u2014the philosoph y of yin- yang balance (X u et al. , 2013). Traditional Chinese medicine views the body as a system of channels through which energy flows. The Chinese call this energy qi or chi. Disease or illness is caused when the energy gets block ed or stagnates and doesn' t flow freely through the body . Herbs, acupuncture, qi gong, tai chi, and Chinese massage are mind-body techniques to help unblock the flow of chi through normal channels and thereb y restore health. Pr actitioners of tr aditional Chinese medicine devise individualiz ed treatment plans based on each patient 's unique diagnosis rather than following a standard interv ention based on the complaint (Abr ams et al. , 2013). In a seminal r andomiz ed controlled trial of Chinese herbal medicine for treatment of irritable bowel syndrome, in vestigators compared a standard and an individualiz ed Chinese herbal formulation to a placebo . Results showed that, compared with patients in the placebo group , patients in the two activ e treatment groups had impro vements in bowel symptoms as r ated b y both the patients and their gastroenterologists at the end of the 16- week interv ention. Howev er, at follow -up 14 weeks after completion of the treatment, only the individualiz ed herbal medicine treatment group maintained impro vement (Abr ams et al., 2013). In China tr aditional medicine is one of the conserv ative treatments for lumbar disc herniation, and sev eral studies ha ve confirmed that it has certain effects on low back pain caused b y lumbar disc herniation. T reatments include acupuncture, or al administr ation of Chinese medicine, external application of Chinese medicine, Chinese tuina (massage), and TCM-char acteristic functional ex ercise. Clinically , these ther apeutic methods are not used alone but in combination (Y uan et al. , 2013). In the treatment of pain due to lumbar disc herniation, different tr aditional Chinese medicine ther apies ha ve different adv antages. P ain is the main symptom in the acute stage and acupuncture has good analgesic effect. Lumbar dysfunction is the main symptom in the remission stage and Chinese massage has good effect on impro ving dysfunction. Or al Chinese herbal formulae, external use of Chinese medicine, and Chinese herbal injection also showed good effect in relieving pain and impro ving dysfunction caused b y lumbar disc herniation (Y uan et al. , 2013).Acupuncture Sites Source: NCCIH. Application of Acupuncture NeedleAcupuncture The term acupuncture describes a family of procedures in volving the stimulation of anatomic points on the body using a v ariety of techniques. The acupuncture technique most often studied scientifically in volves penetr ating the skin with hair -thin metallic needles that are inserted a few millimeters into the skin. According to The Yellow Emperor's Inner Canon , compiled between 206 B .C.E. and 220 C.E. , there are meridians and collater als in the human body comprising a network of channels through which chi and blood flow . Diseases, or pain, are caused b y chi stagnation or blood stasis in the channels. Acupuncture treats this b y inserting a fine needle into the skin at designated points (acupuncture points) (Zhang et al. , 2013). An appropriate choice of the 361 classic acupuncture points is believ ed to restore balance in the body . Modern acupuncturists use not only traditional meridian acupuncture points, but also non- meridian or extr a-meridian acupuncture points (AHRQ , 2010). Acupuncture promotes the circulation of chi and blood and harmoniz es health y and pathogenic chi in the channels (Zhang et al. , 2013). Acupuncture is not a single standardiz ed interv ention. In routine clinical pr actice, the same patient ma y receiv e acupuncture with different char acteristics from different pr actitioners. These differences include specific char acteristics of treatment \u2014such as the number and frequency of sessions or the additional use of electrical stimulation\u2014 as well as the o verall \"style\" of acupuncture. A distinction is often made between tr aditional Chinese acupuncture \u2014in which diagnosis and treatment are based on a theoretical fr amework in volving patterns of symptoms and concepts such as yin, y ang, and the strength of chi\u2014 and westerniz ed approaches, in volving a neuro- anatomical basis for diagnosis and treatment (MacPherson et al. , 2013).Basic acupuncture. Photo by Kyle Hunter, public domain.Researchers from the Acupuncture T rialists' Collabor ation, a group that w as established to synthesiz e data from high-qualit y randomiz ed trials on acupuncture for chronic pain, conducted an analysis of individual patient data from 29 high-qualit y randomiz ed controlled trials, including a total of 17,922 people. These trials investigated the use of acupuncture for back and neck pain, osteoarthritis, shoulder pain, or chronic headache (Vickers, 2012). For all pain t ypes studied, the researchers found modest but statistically significant differences between acupuncture and simulated acupuncture approaches, and larger differences between acupuncture and no- acupuncture controls. (In tr aditional acupuncture, needles are inserted at specific points on the body . Simulated acupuncture includes a v ariety of approaches that mimic this procedure; some approaches do not pierce the skin or use specific points on the body .) The siz es of the effects were gener ally similar across all pain conditions studied (Vick ers, 2012). These findings suggest that the total effects of acupuncture, as experienced b y patients in clinical pr actice, are clinically relev ant. They also noted that their study pro vides the most robust evidence to date that acupuncture is more than just placebo and a reasonable referr al option for patients with chronic pain (Vick ers, 2012). How acupuncture works to reliev e pain and other symptoms is still incompletely understood, although functional MRI (fMRI) studies are beginning to pro vide some answers. Acupuncture seems to change the w ay the br ain perceiv es and processes pain. Using fMRI in 18 v olunteers, German researchers viewed pain centers in the br ain while applying an electrical pain stimulus to subjects' ankles before and after acupuncture treatment. They reported that \"activ ation of br ain areas in volved in pain perception w as significantly reduced or modulated under acupuncture\" (Theysohn et al. , 2010). Chinese T uina (Massage) Tuina is a form of bodywork or massage ther apy that is gener ally used in conjunction with other t ypes of tr aditional Chinese medicine. Among non-drug ther apies, Chinese tuina is widely used in China for pain management. T uina is thought to reliev e pain b y harmonizing the yin and y ang of the organs. T uina is considered gentle on the body and, as such, patients often prefer tuina o ver pharmaceutical drugs (Zhang et al. , 2015).Cupping Procedure Showing Resultant MarkingsTuina in volves a wide r ange of technical manipulations conducted b y a pr actitioner 's finger , hand, elbow , knee, or foot applied to muscle or soft tissue at specific body locations. It incorpor ates man y of the principles of acupuncture, including the use of acupoints. F or instance, tuina often uses manual techniques such as pushing, rubbing, kneading, or high- intensit y, high-frequency patting to clear energy blocks along specific meridians associated with particular conditions (Y ang et al. , 2014). According to tr aditional Chinese medicine, a state of health reflects an underlying state of balance in the chi and blood of the human body . Pain is usually caused b y obstruction of chi and consequently of blood circulation in the affected body region. P athogenic factors such as blood stasis, chi stagnation, phlegm, dampness, and others can be identified as causativ e factors in the blockage. The centr al ther apeutic goal of tuina is to remo ve energetic blocks which lead to chi stagnation. This leads to increased circulation and reduction of localiz ed edema, which helps to reduce associated pain (Y ang et al. , 2014). The A-Shi point in acupuncture theory is the tender , local dermal or muscular area or site on the body surface which reproduces the specific pain being treated when it is gently pressed. Its location indicates the precise place where chi and blood are block ed. Manipulation at the A-Shi point is done with the intention of remo ving the energetic block there to promote the free mo vement of chi and impro ve blood circulation in the region. Studies ha ve demonstr ated that one mechanism b y which this t ype of massage ther apy appears to be clinically beneficial is b y reducing inflammation and promoting mitochondrial biogenesis for repair of damaged sk eletal muscle (Y ang et al. , 2014). Cupping Cupping therapy (CT) is a tr aditional Chinese medical treatment which has been practiced for thousands of y ears. The W orld Health Organization' s defines cupping as a therapeutic method in volving the application of suction b y creating a v acuum. This is typically done using fire in a cup or jar on the dermis of the affected part of the body (Chi et al., 2016). Man y Americans became a ware of cupping when they noticed the characteristic marks on the bodies of the Olympic swim team.A woman receiving fire cupping in Haikou, Hainan, China. Anna Frodesiak, Public domain. People Practicing Tai ChiCupping, as done b y acupuncturists or other ther apists, utilizes a glass or bamboo cup to create suction on the skin o ver a painful area or acupuncture point. It is mostly used in Asian and Middle Eastern countries and has been claimed to reduce pain as well as a host of other symptoms. There are two t ypes of cupping. Dry cupping pulls the skin into the cup without dr awing blood. In wet cupping the skin is lacer ated so that blood is dr awn into the cup (Kim et al. , 2011). Dry cupping creates a v acuum on the skin, with the ensuing negativ e pressure resulting in capillary rupture. The skin of the localiz ed area becomes flushed and ma y show petechiae and ecch ymosis or bruising, in which the dur is ther apeutically beneficial. Cupping has multiple ther apeutic functions which include (1) w arming the channels to remo ve cold, (2) promoting chi and blood circulation, (3) relieving swelling, (4) acceler ating healing, (5) adjusting body temper ature, (6) treating fibrom yalgia, (7) for stroke rehabilitation, h ypertension, musculosk eletal pain, herpes z oster, (8) treatment of facial par alysis, acne, and cervical spondylosis, and (9) alleviating pain, including chronic neck, shoulder pain, and low back pain (Chi et al. , 2016). Movement-Based Therapies Movement ther apies can include, among others, tai chi, qi dong, y oga, F eldenkr ais Method, and Pilates. Qi Gong and Tai Chi Tai chi and qi gong are centuries-old, related mind and body pr actices. They in volve certain postures and gentle mo vements with mental focus, breathing, and relaxation. The movements can be adapted or pr acticed while w alking, standing, or sitting. In contr ast to qi gong, tai chi mo vements, if pr acticed quickly , can be a form of combat or self -defense (NCCIH, 2015). Qi gong means, roughly , to cultiv ate or enhance the inherent functional (energetic) essence of the human being (Jahnk e et al. , 2010). Qi gong pr actice includes mo vement, body posture, mind ex ercises, concentr ation, relaxation, and breathing ex ercises. It is less demanding, both ph ysically and cognitiv ely, than tai chi. R esearchers reported that 8 weeks of qi gong tr aining significantly reduced pain for people with osteoarthritis of the knee compared with the control group (Selfe & Innes, 2009).Source: NCCIH, public domain. Tai chi in volves slow mo vements emphasizing balanced postures, regular breathing, and concentr ation, integr ating mind and body . The gentle, slow mo vements make it particularly useful for those with limited ph ysical strength. T ai chi is used to help manage stress and anger; to impro ve strength, flexibilit y, and coordination; to impro ve lung function; to impro ve balance; and to reduce pain. Lik e qi gong, tai chi has been shown to reliev e pain and impro ve function in people with osteoarthritis of the knee (Selfe & Innes, 2009). For patients with painful knee osteoarthritis, tai chi w as as helpful as ph ysical ther apy in reducing pain and impro ving ph ysical functioning, according to a new study partly funded by the NCCIH. In this study , 204 patients age 40 or older who had knee pain and pro ven osteoarthritis of the knee were r andomly assigned to standardiz ed group tai chi tr aining (two 1-hour sessions each week for 12 weeks) or standard one-on-one ph ysical ther apy (two 30-minute sessions per week for 6 weeks followed b y 6 additional weeks of home- based ex ercises monitored b y the research staff ). Both groups were then encour aged to continue their tai chi pr actice or home ex ercises for a total of 52 weeks. P atients in the two groups had similar decreases in pain and impro vements in ph ysical functioning after 12 weeks, and the benefits of treatment were maintained for the full 52 weeks of the study . Patients in the tai chi group had more impro vement in depression symptoms and qualit y of life than those in the ph ysical ther apy group (NCCIH, 2016d). Yoga Yoga is a mind and body pr actice with origins in ancient Indian philosoph y. The v arious styles of y oga typically combine ph ysical postures, breathing techniques, and meditation or relaxation. There are numerous schools of y oga. Hatha y oga, the most commonly pr acticed in the United States and Europe, emphasiz es postures (asanas) and breathing ex ercises (pranayama). Some of the major st yles typically combines a series of stretching ex ercises, breathing techniques, and progressiv e deep relaxation.Source: Ph otograph by Kennguru\u2014own Y 3.0.A study in volving ninet y-five people aged 18 to 64 from six health centers in a low -income, predominantly minorit y area of Boston found that once- or twice- weekly yoga classes reliev ed pain, impro ved function, and reduced the need for pain medication in minorit y and low - income populations with chronic low back pain. The participants had moder ate to sev ere chronic low back pain and significant related impairment. Most were non- white, unemplo yed or disabled, with annual household incomes of $40,000 or less. The progr am also included home pr actice, k eeping a log, meditation, and information on yoga philosoph y. Participants were allowed to continue with their usual back care (Saper et al. , 2013). Researchers found statistically significant and clinically meaningful impro vements in pain and back -related function in both the once per week and twice per week groups. The most benefit w as experienced within the first 6 weeks, which may be of interest to clinicians who wonder how much y oga to recommend to patients. Adverse ev ents, mostly musculosk eletal pain, were common; they gener ally resolv ed on their own and were not serious (Saper et al. , 2013). In another study , regular and long-term pr actice of y oga w as shown to impro ve pain tolerance. Findings from the study also showed that y oga pr actitioners ha ve more gr ay matter in multiple br ain regions compared with individually matched people who did not practice y oga. The study in volved 14 experienced y oga pr actitioners as well as 14 people who did not pr actice an y mind-body techniques. P articipants underwent a cold pain tolerance test b y immersing a hand in cold w ater until they could no longer toler ate the pain. R esearchers then ask ed participants about str ategies they used to toler ate the pain. The researchers also conducted br ain imaging scans to examine the structur al differences in gray matter and white matter between the y oga pr actitioner group and the control group (Villemure et al. , 2013). Researchers found that y oga pr actitioners toler ated cold pain more than twice as long as the controls. They found no significant difference in total gr ay matter v olume between groups, but y oga pr actitioners had greater gr ay matter v olume in br ain regions related to pain processing, pain regulation, and attention. Across participants, only the increased gray matter in the mid-insular cortex (a portion of the br ain believ ed to pla y a role in autonomic integr ation) correlated with , 2013).The v olume of insular gr ay matter in y oga pr actitioners also positiv ely correlated with the duration of y oga pr actice, suggesting that y oga experience contributed to these structur al differences in the br ain. In addition, y oga pr actitioners had increased white matter integrit y within the left insula. Finally , the researchers observ ed that, to toler ate pain, y oga practitioners used cognitiv e strategies that are integr al parts of y oga pr actice, such as observing the sensation without reacting, accepting the sensation, using the breath, and relaxation while most control participants did not (Villemure et al. , 2013). Other studies suggest that a carefully adapted set of y oga poses ma y reduce low -back pain and impro ve function. One NCCIH-funded study of 90 people with chronic low -back pain found that participants who pr acticed Iy engar y oga had significantly less disabilit y, pain, and depression after 6 months (NCCIH, 2016e). In a 2011 study , also funded b y NCCIH, researchers compared y oga with con ventional stretching ex ercises or a self -care book in 228 adults with chronic low -back pain. The results showed that both y oga and stretching were more effectiv e than a self -care book for impro ving function and reducing symptoms due to chronic low -back pain (NCCIH, 2016e). Conclusions from another 2011 study of 313 adults with chronic or recurring low -back pain suggested that 12 weekly y oga classes resulted in better function than usual medical care (NCCIH, 2016e). Feldenkrais Method The F eldenkr ais Method (FM) is a t ype of ex ercise ther apy that w as dev eloped o ver a period of decades in the last century b y physician Moshe F eldenkr ais. The basis of the approach w as founded in the human potential for learning how to learn. F eldenkr ais developed an experiential process, or set of processes, whereb y an individual or a group could be guided through a series of mo vement - and sensation-based explor ations (Hillier & Worley, 2015). The purpose of the explor ations is to learn to sense the difference between two or more movement options and discern which feels easier and is performed with less effort. This is compared with experiencing less fa vorable feedback such as pain, str ain, or discomfort. Participants are encour aged to try man y alternativ e movements to increase their awareness of distinctions and impro vements. Thus the process of intention, action, gaining feedback, making decisions, and re-enacting with adaptations constitutes the learning framework in a somatic context (Hillier & W orley, 2015).Because it promotes gentle mo vement within a comfortable r ange of motion, the Feldenkr ais Method is particularly effectiv e for older adults experiencing pain and stiffness from arthritis. It is taught in two par allel forms, A wareness Through Mo vement (conducted as a group ex ercise) and Functional Integr ation (one-on-one approach) (W ebb et al. , 2013). Awareness Through Mo vement lessons are v erbally guided explor ations of mo vement that are about 30-60 minutes long. Each lesson explores mo vement related to a particular function such as w alking, rolling, or sitting to enhance a wareness of how mo vements are performed and in vite the participant to in vestigate how they might expand their action and ability to function. The lessons address habitual patterns of mo vement and expand a person' s self-image. By exploring no vel mo vement sequences, attention is dr awn to parts of the self which the person ma y not be a ware of and ma y have excluded from their functioning. The method aims for a heightened self -awareness, an expansion of a person' s repertoire of mo vement, and impro ved functioning where the whole body cooper ates in movement and where maximum efficiency is achiev ed with minimum effort. Dr . Feldenkr ais described the aim of the method as \"a person who is organiz ed to mo ve with minimum effort and maximum efficiency , not through muscular effort, but through increased consciousness of how mo vement works\" (W ebb et al. , 2013). Video (3:33): Feldenkrais for Everyday Life https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uCM_C0Ly0Dc&index=4&list=PLx83c-HVFBfA5quYOUCc3F0z4ox3K054- Single, r andomiz ed controlled studies of F eldenkr ais ex ercises ha ve reported statistically significant, positiv e benefits compared to control interv entions and include the following impro vements: Feldenkr ais for E veryday Life Feldenkr ais for E veryday Life Impro ved neck flexion and less perceiv ed effort after a single F eldenkr ais lesson for neck comfort Reduced prev alence of neck pain and disabilit y in symptomatic women after Feldenkr ais (individual and group sessions compared to con ventional care or home exercises) and Reduced perceiv ed effort in F eldenkr ais group for people with upper torso/limb discomfort (Hillier and W orley, 2015) The Mo ving with Ease progr am is a selection of A wareness Through Mo vement lessons from the F eldenkr ais Method. Because the lessons are gentle and enjo yable, they ma y enable people with osteoarthritis to mo ve more easily and better manage their pain. The self-explor atory nature of the classes pro vides an opportunit y for participants to become aware of how they mo ve, thus learning to minimiz e their functional limitations. The lessons become a form of self -management that addresses a significant aspect of the process of disablement in people with osteoarthritis (W ebb et al. , 2013). In a small A ustralian study seeking to understand if participation in a Mo ving with Ease progr am impro ved mobilit y and decreased pain in participants with osteoarthritis, feedback was positiv e. When ask ed to describe what they had learned b y participating in the progr am, comments included: \"How ex ercise/mo vement is crucial to managing pain. \" \"To exercise where it is comfortable, not to force it. \" \"To walk with a more fluid, gentle motion. \" \"I learnt to incorpor ate some of the ex ercises into m y daily life. \" Participants were ask ed to comment on their experience of pain and, in particular , the pain associated with their osteoarthritis, after participating in the progr am. T en of the fifteen participants said their pain lev el had impro ved, three were unsure and two said they had not noticed an y difference. Comments included \"The pain is continual, but I manage it better ,\" \"At the end of the session I w as free from pain and felt energiz ed,\" \"I can experience less pain in the knees, which is where the osteoarthritis appears for my body ,\" \"The lessons...eased the pain in m y lower back, \" \"No pain in the knees when going up stairs, \" and \"It is not a cure, howev er it is the best 'ex ercise' I ha ve experienced for managing m y osteoarthritis\" (W ebb et al. , 2013).

Core stabilit y, strength, and flexibilit y are emphasiz ed in Pilates ex ercise, as is control of movement, posture, and breathing. All of these aspects of Pilates ex ercise ma y benefit people with chronic low back pain, as ex ercises with similar features ha ve been successful in reducing pain and impro ving functional abilit y (Wells et al. , 2014). Barriers to Effective Pain Management The [Institute of Medicine] committee [has] identified sev eral important barriers to adequate pain care in the United States. These include the magnitude of the problem, pro vider attitudes and tr aining, insur ance coverage, cultur al attitudes of patients, geogr aphic barriers, and regulatory barriers. Institute of Medicine, 2011 Consider the following barriers to effectiv e pain management. Where are the tools and the time, and how am reimbursed? Those are the issues and barriers in pain management. Giv en the time constr aints in an office setting, how can I impro ve my expertise and how can I be reimbursed? R egardless of the t ype of pain, it 's fair to say that anyone who has chronic, prolonged pain is going to ha ve psy chological issues that must be addressed. Where y ou see a patient on the continuum of their pain is going to influence the pro vider and what sort of treatment modalities y ou offer . We are being slammed with all these new position papers and regulations about abuse of opioids sa ying \"Hey , you guys, this is all y our fault and y ou should ha ve been doing more\"\u2014ev en though the insur ance companies aren' t providing more reimbursement, nor is anyone providing pr actical tools to enhance pro vider tr aining, skills, and all those things. For liabilit y purpose the focus is going to shift onto the pro vider and that 's going to mak e us reluctant to prescribe. The onus is on the prescriber not to prescribe. T reating pain properly and effectiv ely is an order of magnitude more complicated than it used to be because of these issues and barriers.Board Certified F amily Nurse Pr actitioner , California The complexit y of our healthcare system creates significant barriers to effectiv e pain management in all areas of medicine and across all age groups. The sheer magnitude and complexit y of treating pain in a fr agmented healthcare system that is struggling to contain costs means better education and tr aining, better interdisciplinary communication and cooper ation, and better reimbursement for pro ven treatment options are desper ately needed. According to the Institute of Medicine, treatment of pain is often disorganiz ed, ineffectiv e, and inaccessible. Man y members of the public, people with pain themselv es, and man y health professionals are not adequately prepared to tak e prev entive action, recogniz e warning signs, initiate timely and appropriate treatment, or seek specialt y consultation when necessary with respect to pain (IOM, 2011). Several factors influence treatment options, especially when pain is persistent or sev ere (PPSG, 2014b): Costly , inappropriate, or inadequate procedures are sometimes carried out when other approaches\u2014such as counseling, prev ention, and self -management \u2014might be more appropriate. There is still v ariabilit y among clinicians in applying new and ev en existing knowledge about pain and its management. This is reflected in the documentation of inappropriate or indeed lack of treatment for cancer patients, HIV/AIDS patients, and neonates\u2014 and post oper ative pain, among others (Sessle, 2012). To address these issues and barriers, the Institute of Medicine (IOM, 2011) has recommended: Providers should promote and enable self -management of pain. There should be easily accessible and cost -effectiv e educational opportunities in pain assessment and treatment in primary care. Collabor ation must be impro ved between pain specialists and primary care clinicians, including referr al to pain centers when appropriate.Knowledge, beliefs, and attitudes of healthcare professionals1. Patient and family perceptions 2. Inadequate attention to pain in certain patient populations3. Restrictiv e policies go verning healthcare pr actice, as well as concerns about regulatory scrutin y when prescribing controlled substances4.Reimbursement policies must be revised to foster coordinated and evidence-based pain care. Providers must pro vide consistent and complete pain assessments. Education. Education. Education. Educate more ph ysicians on proper diagnosis and proper pain management. Educate the person living with pain and their family on addiction v ersus ph ysical dependency and proper stor age of medication. Educate the public and press about the realities of pain medication and people living with pain. Person with Chronic P ain, IOM, 2011 The inadequate education of healthcare professionals is a major and persistent barrier to effectiv e pain management. Despite the health professions' dev elopment of competencies in pain management, as well as the m yriad guidelines and position articles on pain management issued b y numerous professional bodies, core pain management competencies for pre-licensure, entry -level health professionals ha ve not y et been established. The limited pain education that is currently pro vided ma y be ineffectiv e because it focuses on tr aditional, impersonal topics such as anatom y and ph ysiology that may have little direct relev ance to the complex daily problems faced b y patients, families, and clinicians (Fishman et al. , 2013). In most health professional progr ams, the topic of pain occupies only a minor component of the curriculum. In North America and Europe, for example, dental and medical students receiv e on a verage less than 20 hours of formal education about pain throughout their multi- year progr am. The Institute of Medicine has stated that pain education is critically important and that the feder al government is in a position to contribute to impro vements in patient and professional education about pain. The IOM recommends that the medical professionals (1) expand and redesign education progr ams, (2) impro ve curriculum and education for healthcare professionals, and (3) increase the number of health professionals with adv anced expertise in pain care (IOM, 2011). The American Academ y of P ain Medicine has echoed the IOM recommendations b y publishing a set of inter -professional core competencies for pain management, which are categoriz ed within four domains. These domains address (1) the fundamental concepts and complexit y of pain; (2) how pain is observ ed and assessed; (3) collabor ative approaches to treatment options; and (4) application of competencies across the lifespan in the context of various settings, populations, and care team models (Fishman et al. , 2013).Undergr aduate health science progr ams can pla y a role in impro ving our understanding of pain and its management. Currently , most undergr aduate healthcare progr ams pro vide limited pain content, which does not ensure that gr aduates ha ve the knowledge, skills, or clinical competence to pro vide qualit y pain care throughout the lifespan. Understanding the phenomenon of pain, its immediate and long-term consequences, and its effectiv e management is lacking or is minimal in man y health science curricula, including those for nursing. This lack of knowledge and effectiv e translation into a usable form for practitioners r aises the following question: Do gr aduates ha ve sufficient knowledge and skills to be competent in giving appropriate pain management to their patients (Herr et al. , 2015)? Core competencies in pain management for pre-licensure health professional education have been established, which map well to the International Association for the Study of Pain's inter -professional pain curricula. These competencies delineate expectations for minimally acceptable skills for pain management for gr aduating health profession students, regardless of discipline. They pro vide a basis for preparing students to apply knowledge and skills successfully in a manner that supports inter -professional team contributions in providing qualit y pain care in the real world (Herr et al. , 2015). Concluding Remarks on Pain Although international agreements ha ve mandated that countries pro vide adequate pain medications to reliev e the suffering of their people, pain remains one of the major unaddressed issues of modern societ y, particularly in poor countries. One of the great hopes of modern pain treatment, opioid analgesics, has led to an epidemic of o veruse and diversion in some countries while at the same time being completely una vailable to those suffering from sev ere pain in other countries. Pain management policies ha ve been dev eloped b y a number of regulatory agencies, which provide v oluntary and mandatory guidelines about pain management in healthcare organizations. A balanced multimodal approach to pain and its management is a k ey concept for healthcare organizations and clinicians. Analgesics are important component of pain management: non-opioid, opioid, and adjuv ant medications are a vailable for the treatment and management of pain. Safe use of analgesics is promoted b y utilizing a multimodal approach, using more than one t ype of analgesic to treat an individual' s pain. Howev er, opioid analgesics carry a high potential for misuse, abuse, and div ersion, ev en when prescribed for legitimate medical purposes, and clinicians must educate themselv es about these issues and understand that opioid analgesics ha ve the potential for misuse.Consistent assessment and documentation of pain using an individualiz ed approach is recommended b y a number of organizations. Clinicians should be familiar with a v ariety of pain assessment tools and understand the necessit y for regular assessment of pain based upon the needs of patient. Many nonpharmacologic techniques are a vailable for the treatment of pain. Ph ysical and occupational ther apy, chiropr actic techniques, tr aditional medication, and complementary , alternativ e, and integr ative practices are popular and well-toler ated. Although evidence-based studies are limited, there is increasing evidence that man y of these techniques successfully decrease pain, and more research is underw ay. The Institute of Medicine (2011) sums up the underlying principles related to effectiv e management and treatment of pain, which pro vides a fitting conclusion to this course: Pain is a mor al imper ative. Chronic pain can be a disease in itself . Comprehensiv e treatment is critical. Interdisciplinary assessment and treatment ma y yield the best results. Prevention is important. Existing knowledge must be used more widely . Opioids present a conundrum. The clinician-patient relationship is of utmost importance. Public health and communit y-based approaches are in valuable.
