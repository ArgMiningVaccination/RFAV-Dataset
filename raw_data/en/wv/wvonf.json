You all know the story of how on July 19, 1937 the iconic first female aviator disappeared into the Pacific during her flight around the globe. Well, according to an article covered by Science Daily on March 7th, professor Richard Jantz of the University of Tennessee used his forensic anthropologic expertise to match skeletal remains found in the South Pacific to Amelia Earhart. This injury is the stretching of ulnar nerve that runs through cubital tunnel, which is is the largest unprotected nerve on the body. The nerve can tear when the ulnar nerve is compressed. It is between the medial epicondyle and olecranon, and runs along the ulnar bone. For the muscles, the cubital tunnel is adjacent to to triceps and continues down the forearm between the flexor carpi ulnaris muscle.It can be either chronic or acute, but it typically acute. It is near the medial head of the tricep and the arcuate ligament. Also, the arcade of struthers, medial intermuscular the deep flexor aponeurosis are affected. Osteogenesis Imperfecta is a disorder of the bones which causes the bones to be very weak and fragile. The first element identified for the safety goal is staff and patient education on surgical site infection. Staff at my facility must undergo mandatory training upon hire and yearly regarding policies, procedures and protocols that need to be strictly adhered to in the prevention of surgical site infection. Patient's are educated prior to surgery during the preoperative phone call and asked to bathe the morning of the surgery or the night before using antibacterial soap. For total joint procedures there are additional steps in the The capillary nail refill test is a quick test done on the nail bed. It is used to monitor dehydration and the amount of blood flow to tissue. If there is good blood flow to the nail bed, a pink color should return in less than 2 seconds after pressure is removed. Retrograde amnesia is when you lose all memories from the recent past ( for example you get some sort of brain damage which then leads to the retrograde amnesia and you lose all memories from the past 2-5 years, maybe even less than 2 years and more than 5 ) . You can get retrograde amnesia therapy - ( people purposely get electroconvulsive therapy to get amnesia, but it is most likely to trigger a seizure). The retrograde amnesia happens because you lost important brain cells, and once you lost them you can't get them back, so you will have to re-make them by making new memories. Between 35% and 50% of all women over 50 had at least one vertebral fracture. In the United States, 700,000 vertebral fractures occur annually, but only about a third are recognized. In a series of 9704 women aged 68.8 on average studied for 15 years, 324 had already suffered a vertebral fracture at entry into the study and 18.2% developed a vertebral fracture, but that risk rose to 41.4% in women who had a previous vertebral Fractured wrists are a common injury. In many cases, the accident occurs when people try to prevent themselves from a basic slip and fall or a sports injury. In either situation, the impact on an outstretched hand can create a fracture in one of the numerous bones within the hand or wrist. If the impact is severe, a surgeon for fractured wrist is needed to help reset the bones and repair any damage. Find the best surgeon for fractured wrist by taking the time to research options. In severe infections, you may be very uncomfortable. You can also develop complications such as skin breaks, ulcers, open sores, and cellulitis 1. List two factors that keep bones healthy. Describe in detail how these factors impact bone health. Pain at the site of injury is severe and continue to worsen over time. Individual will experience flu-like symptoms such as nausea, fever, diarrhea and dizziness. Within two to four days after being infected, the affecting area beings to swell and show a purplish rash. The affected area may also develop a blister filled with blackish fluid, skin appears necrotic. Blood pressure drops because the heart isn 't pumping blood sufficiently and the body isn 't getting enough oxygen. The body begins to go into toxic shock from the toxin the bacteria is giving off. Diagnosis depends on how rapidly the skin changes, redness, pain greater than the actual injury, erythema, skin necrosis, bullae and crepitus. Amputation of legs, hands, finger, toes are likely to happen to save the person 's life. Amputation occurs because the immune system can 't fight the bacteria at the A malleolus fracture is a break (fracture) of the tibia, the large bone in your lower leg. The medial malleolus is the lower part of the tibia that you feel as the bump on the inside of your ankle. The posterior malleolus is the lower-rear part of the tibia that is closest to your heel. Head injuries can be fatal or may cause permanent disability or damage to the brain if it is not identified and treated in a timely manner. A CT scan within one hour after a traumatic event will allow for rapid treatment and improve the outcomes for people with head injuries that have damaged the brain. When used appropriately, the benefits of a CT scan far exceed the risks. CT scans can provide detailed information to diagnose, plan treatment for, and evaluate many conditions in adults and children. Traumatic injury accounts for 11% of global mortality and is a leading cause of disability (Sharma, Krug and Lozano, 2000). Trauma affects society on a physical, psychological and economical level (Lyons et al., 2010). Quality trauma care requires an integrated and resourced trauma system. The aim of a trauma system is to facilitate the timely treatment of severely injured patients where resources are available for their optimal management and rehabilitation (Celso et al., 2006). Once the trauma patient has arrived at the trauma centre, in-hospital trauma systems, such as trauma teams, are activated and facilitate systematic clinical assessment and ongoing patient care (Liberman et al., 2005; Teixaeira et al., 2007). Quality and effective initial assessment and resuscitation of trauma patients require a multidisciplinary trauma team led by medical and nursing staff (Cole and Crichton, 2006) "}
