Thank you for considering this important piece of legislation. I can attest to the importance of providing people with more access to food education in the state of Missouri. People are sick and desperately want more options. Access is extremely limited, particularly in rural areas. These professionals do something different from dietitians and they are more than qualified to fill this need. Not everyone wants to work with a dietitian or even has access to one. Allowing more professionals in this field to work far outweigh any argument why they should not. This state is far more restrictive than other states on this issue and people just keep getting sicker. This really should be about consumer choice and providing your constituents with more options.

Dear Representatives,This very important piece of legislation, HB 475, directly impacts me and my ability to work in the state of Missouri. I am a Nutrition Therapy Practitioner. I do not diagnose, treat, or cure disease. However, I have been properly educated to help others make positive changes to their health through diet and lifestyle. We need more qualified professionals working in the state of Missouri to educate our fellow Missourians on how to make diet and lifestyle modifications to improve their health. We need more professionals that can provide individualized support, motivation, and offer strategies to form healthy habits to transform their health. Our existing medical model cannot offer this support.Unfortunately, despite my education, the current Missouri law does not allow me to provide nutrition advice to help fellow Missourians. I ask that you please support HB 475. This legislation is critical to improve the health of those in our state and to create more jobs and tax payers. Thank you,Amanda DaneFenton, MissouriWITNESS 2/24/2021 COMMITTEE: Professional Registration and Licensing FOR INFORMATIONAL PURPOSES IN OPPOSITION TO IN SUPPORT OF TESTIFYING: WITNESS NAME THIS FORM IS PUBLIC RECORD UNDER CHAPTER 610, RSMo. To Whom It Concerns: I am a National Board Certified Health and Wellness Coach, certified via a board exam proctored by the National Board of Medical Examiners. I work alongside two MD's, an ND (Naturopathic Doctor), and a Nurse Practitioner at a pain management practice in St. Louis, Missouri. I do not diagnose, treat, or prescribe. I employ advanced coaching techniques and teach general nutrition and wellness principles to my clients, thereby supporting these licensed providers in their efforts to help their patients create sustainable change with regard to their eating habits and lifestyle choices. Our pain management providers know that their patients can significantly impact their pain levels and reduce need for and dependence on medications by addressing inflammatory food and lifestyle choices. A few years ago, I personally overcame multiple autoimmune diseases, mental health challenges, and painful conditions through diet and lifestyle changes. An MD who was treating me throughout my health issues noticed my transformation and recommended that I become a Health Coach. I hold several certifications in coaching and nutrition, the first of which was obtained through the Institute for Integrative Nutrition. I also have a Master's Degree in Communication. I also host workshops in urban and rural communities, providing education and access to underserved areas for people who otherwise would not be able to afford. Passing this bill would allow me to step more fully into my mission to serve, protecting my right to practice in the state of Missouri. Thank you for your support! With Gratitude, Amanda LaPlante, MA, NBC-HWC, 2/24/2021 COMMITTEE: Professional Registration and Licensing FOR INFORMATIONAL PURPOSES IN OPPOSITION TO IN SUPPORT OF TESTIFYING: WITNESS NAME THIS FORM IS PUBLIC RECORD UNDER CHAPTER 610, RSMo. I ask you today to support HB 475 which allows a Non-RD pathway to practice for those professionals who are NOT registered dietitians. We are asking to be able to practice at the level of our training and education without fear of penalty. I recently obtained a Naturopathic degree and I'm currently enrolled in a nutrition certification program. These degrees will allow me to work one-on-one with clients providing individualized nutrition education, guidance, and daily food recommendations. Everyone is different so having the ability to educate based on individual needs is extremely important. The training I have obtained and those I am seeking do not give me the ability to diagnose, treat, or cure any disease, and I do not claim to be licensed by the State of Missouri nor do I state or imply that I am a dietitian or nutritionist. I chose this profession because of what I see happening to the health and livelihoods of those nearest to my heart. I have a strong desire to help people live purposefully in making choices that give them a healthy lifestyle and hopefully a longer life. Although I still have much to learn, I am hopeful that my future opportunities will allow me to educate clients without fear of punishment.WITNESS APPEARANCE FORMMISSOURI HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES HB 475BILL NUMBER: DATE: 2/24/2021 COMMITTEE: Professional Registration and Licensing FOR INFORMATIONAL PURPOSES IN OPPOSITION TO IN SUPPORT OF TESTIFYING: WITNESS NAME INDIVIDUAL: THIS FORM IS PUBLIC RECORD UNDER CHAPTER 610, RSMo. Dear Representatives,Hello, I am Angelica Bustamante and I live in southeast Kansas City, Missouri. I am proud to support you and am grateful for your service. As one of your constituents, I would like to request your support on House Bill 475, which will allow all formally trained nutrition professionals to work with individuals and groups discussing food selection in the state of Missouri.I have been a licensed massage therapist in Missouri for 20 years, which can take a physical toll on the body so in March of 2020, I registered and paid for a Health Coach certification program, only to find out that it is illegal in my home state of Missouri. 33 of our 51 states allow more qualified people to perform individualized nutrition counseling. Doctors recommend lifestyle changes but they do not have the resources to help their patients put it into practice. The AMA did a study (2017/O'Reilly) and had overwhelming results of better outcomes of health improvement with doctors offices that had Health Coaches in them. The American Health Association and we have allies in Washington, DC with the introduction of the Health and Wellness Coach Resolution in Congress. The U.S. Department of Labor forecast a 16% increase in health and wellness coaching and health education. A Health Coach's scope of practice includes providing: general wellness and nutrition information; options, recommendations, guidance, motivation, skill-building to establish healthier lifestyle routines; and other support mechanisms for achieving client-focused personal health goals. The National Consortium for Credentialing Health & Wellness Coaches further defines health and wellness coaches as professionals from diverse backgrounds and education who work with individuals and groups in a client-centered process to facilitate and empower the client to achieve self-determined goals related to health and wellness. Successful coaching takes place when coaches apply clearly defined knowledge and skills so the clients mobilize internal strengths and external resources for sustainable change. The key to both of these definitions regarding health coaching is that the client (often after consulting a healthcare professional) sets his or her own goals and drives the process to achieve lasting wellness changes. Because health coaching is a client-driven experience, rather than a traditional healthcare patient/client relationship, the application of decades-old dietetics practice laws to Health Coaches would be inaccurate and likely unconstitutional if applied.Personally, I see health issues from lifestyle choices all around me. Many clients do not know how to handle the stress of their jobs and the health toll it is taking on their bodies. In the fall semester (August to December) of 2018, I had strep throat, a sinus infection, a bladder infection, the flu and lastly, walking pneumonia. All from a stress induced, lowered immune system. If only I could have been legally counseled by a Health and Wellness Coach on how to handle my stress, it would have saved me money, time away from work and digestive issues from taking two rounds of antibiotics. I also see it in my family. In November of 2019, my mom was diagnosed with type 2 diabetes. After the education and coaching received from a health coach (in a non-restrictive state), her blood sugar levels remain stable and she's never felt better. Thank you for your time. I pray that you will pass this legislation and allow me and other coaches and nutritiontherapists to help the people of Missouri and be able to educate them on healthy food, lifestyle and wellness.In full faith,Angelica Bustamante, 2/24/2021 COMMITTEE: Professional Registration and Licensing FOR INFORMATIONAL PURPOSES IN OPPOSITION TO IN SUPPORT OF TESTIFYING: WITNESS NAME INFORMATION ON THIS FORM IS PUBLIC RECORD UNDER CHAPTER 610, RSMo.

Dear Committee, My name is Beth Carlton and while I cannot attend the hearing today, I am submitting written testimony to ask that you support the passage of House Bill 475. I am a licensed Occupational Therapist and also Board Certified in Holistic Nutrition by the National Association of Nutrition Professionals (NANP). I was reported by a local dietician to our hospital administration for providing nutrition advice to multiple patients, even after having received physician referrals for these patients. Following thorough chart reviews, I received overwhelming support from the hospital administration. I believe the initial report occurred due to a lack of understanding regarding my nutrition training and scope of practice in the holistic nutrition field. I have local physicians who have voiced the want and need for different nutrition approaches for their patients. I am on the front lines of the health care industry and see the burden that chronic illness has placed on our communities. I possess the skill set to address these needed lifestyle changes but risk losing my OT licensure and credibility due to current state restrictions on who may practice. My scope of practice includes teaching \"how\" not \"what.\" Throughout the grueling training process, I also learned about and adhere to our ethics standards; referring those people who are outside of our scope of practice to a licensed medical practitioner. I ask that you pass HB475 so that I, and many other highly skilled nutrition professionals, may help your constituents thrive.Thank you for your time,Beth Carlton, MOT, OTR/L, 2/24/2021 COMMITTEE: Professional Registration and Licensing FOR INFORMATIONAL PURPOSES IN OPPOSITION TO IN SUPPORT OF TESTIFYING: WITNESS NAME THIS FORM IS PUBLIC RECORD UNDER CHAPTER 610, RSMo.

Committee Members: Brandy Hickman, Springfield, Missouri HB 475Clarifying My name is Brandy Hickman. Thank you for your time. I am here to urge you to pass HB 475. I am not a clinician, yet I can lessen the health industry's burden in our state. It cost nothing; the bill is not asking for licensure and in no way devalues the dieticians' licensure. I do not claim to be a dietician. I do not provide medical nutrition therapy, diagnose, treat or cure diseases. I intentionally chose my path as a Nationally Board Certified Health Coach and am highly trained and within my scope of practice. I still require the ability to assess and individualize as I have been trained. It is not safe not to do this. Searching for dieticians in Springfield, Missouri, and other rural areas shows how underserved Missouri consumers are in this area. What we are doing is not working, and the risk ratio outweighs the health of our state. There is absolutely no objective data to show any harm in my field in our state.Training: I am a National Board Certified Health & Wellness Coach, a small business owner, and the Missouri Nutrition Alliance's Board Chairman. The testing to become Board Certified is done through a partnership with the National Board of Medical Examiners and the National Board of Health and Wellness Coaching (NBHWC). To sit for this 4-hour board assessment at an approved proxy center administered by the National Board of Medical Examiners (NMBE), I had to meet precise criteria that include, but are not limited to, a Bachelor of Science Degree and Nutrition Training with an approved school. Founded in 1915, the NBME is an independent, not-for-profit organization whose mission is to protect the public's health through state- of-the-art assessment of health professionals worldwide. The credentials enable those board-certified to provide evidence of their expertise and quality as competent health & wellness coaches and adhere to a strict Code of Ethics. Why At a young age, over 20 years ago, I was diagnosed with early-stage colon cancer. I am grateful every day for my healthcare team. After multiple colonoscopies and a clean bill of health, I am thankful. I was referred to the Mayo Clinic and saw first-hand an integrative approach to healthcare. Personally, my most challenging time was not the diagnosis; It was being overwhelmed with all that I needed to learn and implement into my life for my health. How was I going to do this? I needed hope and confidence in my health. That is why I chose Health Coaching. To do my job effectively, I need to assess and individualize clients as part of my career. The current law makes it challenging to serve my clients' needs. I am asking that the committee please vote favorably in amending this law by passing HB 475. Thank you for your time.WITNESS APPEARANCE REPRESENTATIVES HB 475BILL NUMBER: DATE: 2/24/2021 COMMITTEE: Professional Registration and Licensing FOR INFORMATIONAL PURPOSES IN OPPOSITION TO IN SUPPORT OF TESTIFYING: WITNESS NAME INFORMATION ON THIS FORM IS PUBLIC RECORD UNDER CHAPTER 610, RSMo. Chair Jeff ColemanCommittee on Professional Registration and LicensingHouse Hearing Room 1201 W Capitol Ave.Jefferson City, Missouri 65101Dear Chair Coleman, Vice-Chair Dinkins, Ranking Member Brown, and members of the Committee:I write to you on behalf of CrossFit LLC to express our strong support for HB 475, which amends Missouri's Dietitian Practice Act to exempt individuals providing basic information, assessment of, and guidance about food from the licensure requirement. We urge the Committee to report HB 475 favorably. If enacted, this bill would immediately allow Missouri's more than 100 CrossFit gyms and the trainers they employ to provide basic nutrition speech and services without fear of onerous fines. The exemption language will allow for these small businesses to expand and help more people live healthy lifestyles. The bill would amend the existing law to read: 324.206. As long as the person involved does not represent or hold himselfor herself out as a dietitian as defined by subdivision (4) of subsection 2 of section324.200, nothing in sections 324.200 to 324.225 is intended to limit, preclude, orotherwise interfere with:(6) Any person [furnishing general nutrition information as] disseminating free literature or providing individualized nutrition assessment, guidance, encouragement, recommendations, or weight control services as to the use of food, food materials, or dietary supplements [nor prevent in any way the free dissemination of literature]; provided, however, no such individual may call himself or herself a dietitian unless he or she is licensed under this chapter.HB 475 would allow individuals to provide basic services to clients and customers, including for remuneration, so long as the individuals do not use protected titles. These services could include meal planning, recipe creation, and encouragement and guidance that many of us require. The professionals that we represent are not medical practitioners, nor do they claim to be. They have a unique set of skills that assist individuals with bridging the gap between their goals, and the advice of their doctors. HB 475 would allow Missourians to provide support so that their clients eat better and live healthier lifestyles. The State Committee of Dietitians (\u00a7 324.203) regulates, in part, who may give diet, nutrition, food, weight loss advice, guidance and recommendations to individuals. Only registered dietitians, along with a very narrow group of nutritionists, may provide these services, artificially restricting the marketplace. The existing law has made it harder for people to choose a path to better health that works for them, from the provider of their choice. According to the Missouri Department of Professional Registration, the state currently licenses 2,314 Dietitian Nutritionists. That amounts to approximately one dietitian for every 2,600 residents, a tremendous deficit in access and results. Enacting HB 475 would increase the number of market participants in the nutrition marketplace, and allow for more access to services. Missouri's Dietitian Practice Act is outdated and does not reflect the realities of the nutrition guidance marketplace. Though the Act's proponents may claim otherwise, there is no empirical evidence that this form of licensure protects the public, nor is there evidence thatthe Act has made Missourians comparatively safer than residents of states that do not require a license to dispense nutrition guidance. There simply is no data that suggests allowing more people to talk about nutrition is dangerous. On the contrary, in states which do not restrict their residents from speaking with each other about nutrition, rates of chronic disease are markedly lower. Health and wellness coaching and training is a rapidly expanding field, and outdated laws which provide little public benefit should not stifle innovation and access to services. Please report HB 475 favorably to reform Missouri's Dietitian Practice Act so that we can support more people's work to improve the health and wellness of Missourians.WITNESS APPEARANCE FORMMISSOURI HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES HB 475BILL NUMBER: DATE: 2/24/2021 COMMITTEE: Professional Registration and Licensing FOR INFORMATIONAL PURPOSES IN OPPOSITION TO IN SUPPORT OF TESTIFYING: WITNESS NAME THIS FORM IS PUBLIC RECORD UNDER CHAPTER 610, RSMo. Thank you for considering this important piece of legislation, which will provide people with more access to food education in the state of Missouri. As someone who is looking for ways to improve my health and the health of my family, I would desire more information and alternative dietary options to consider. Access to such information and options is extremely limited, particularly in rural areas. These professionals do something different from dietitians and they are more than qualified to fill this need. Not everyone wants to work with a dietitian or even has access to one. Allowing more professionals in this field to work far outweigh any argument why they should not. As a Missouri taxpayer, I feel that providing citizens more choice to improve their diet and health will reduce incidents of chronic illness and reduce overall costs to individuals and to the state.

Dear Members of the Committee,My Name is Brigitte Factor. I'm from Ozark, MO. I'm writing to ask for your support for HB 475. I'm a highly qualified and experienced nutrition professional and the current dietetics law prohibits me from practicing to the level I'm trained. I'm Board Certified in Holistic Nutrition from the National Association of Nutrition Professionals with clinical experience working with a Board Certified Neurologist and Functional Medicine Doctor. I'm also Co-Founder and Program Director of the Missouri Nutrition Alliance.My credentials also include a Master of Science degree in Chemistry from Missouri State University and dual Bachelors of Science degrees in Chemistry and Biology from Southwest Baptist University. Plus, additional Ph.D. level education and research experience from the University of Arkansas.I have taught chemistry and nutrition classes at the college level for the past 20 years as an adjunct instructor. Many of my students have become allied health professionals using the nutrition knowledge from my class in their profession. I want to serve the members of my community in a larger capacity by providing professional nutrition services but the exclusive scope of practice restrictions in Missouri prevent me from doing so. However, I can practice in any one of 36 other states that do not have these restrictions, but I want to stay in my home state.The current restrictions prevent me from being able to perform a proper assessment for my clients and provide individualized recommendations unless I become a dietician. I do not want to become a dietitian and I'm not asking for licensure as I do not practice medical nutrition. I have a defined scope of practice put forth by the NANP and I stay within my scope. These restrictions also prevent many qualified practitioners from working in Missouri. We need them to educate our community about how to make healthier diet and lifestyle choices. We need to change the current law so that many health coaches and nutritionists who are unable to effectively work in Missouri can work to make an impact on the millions of Missourians who could develop obesity, diabetes, or any other diet-related health issues.Dieticians should not have a monopoly on nutrition advice. They are not the only ones qualified to do nutritional assessments and give individualized recommendations. I'm asking you to make the common-sense decision that will positively impact the future health of Missourians and vote in support of HB 475.Regards,Brigitte Factor, MS, NUMBER: DATE: 2/24/2021 COMMITTEE: Professional Registration and Licensing FOR INFORMATIONAL PURPOSES IN OPPOSITION TO IN SUPPORT OF TESTIFYING: WITNESS NAME BUSINESS/ORGANIZATION: WITNESS NAME: BRYAN THIS FORM IS PUBLIC RECORD UNDER CHAPTER 610, RSMo. I am writing to strongly support of HB 475. As such this would allow other duly licensed professionals such as Board-Certified Holistic Nutritionists (BCHN) and Nutrition Therapy Practitioners (NTP) amongst others to provide nutrition care in Missouri. As a medical doctor practicing for 34 years and further certified in Integrative medicine, I assess and treat causes of medical issues. Poor food and diet choices cause at least 80 percent of chronic and acute medical problems. At minimum 33% of most states' populations are overweight to the point of prediabetes which further progresses to full diabetes, high blood pressure, stroke, cancer, dementia amongst many other degenerative diseases. America spends 10 times as much money on its health care yet ranks below 40 other countries in health and wellness. States and the Federal government are on the hook to provide medical care way beyond their budgets for medical problems quite preventable. If the market were allowed to grow with more food education services providers then imagine the benefits to our overall health not to mention savings to state and federal budgets. Existing legislation in Missouri allows licensing and diet advice only from registered dieticians. As I hope you can appreciate there exists a much greater need for nutrition guidance than current law allows. Current law also appears protectionist for the Academy of Nutrition and Dietetics. As most monopolistic policy goes, it arguably more benefits those in power than the population it is supposed to serve. I hope to appeal to your capitalistic side opening the market to well qualified nutrition providers who will fill a much-needed void and lower the costs in the medical care of Missourians. Thank you for your consideration and the time spent reading my testimony,Sincerely,Bryan Warner MDHealth By Design MD1034 S Brentwood Blvd Ste 516St Louis, NUMBER: DATE: 2/24/2021 COMMITTEE: Professional Registration and Licensing FOR INFORMATIONAL PURPOSES IN OPPOSITION TO IN SUPPORT OF TESTIFYING: WITNESS NAME THIS FORM IS PUBLIC RECORD UNDER CHAPTER 610, RSMo.

Fortunately, my need is not so serious that I need to see a dietician. I just want some support to eat healthy and have someone in my corner. Someone to teach me to cook healthy meals and organize my kitchen. I have found that in a \"health coach\". Please let these professionals continue to practice. They serve a community of us who just need a little help. In my situation, I would not see a Dietician - too much.

Functional MedicineThe Resurrection of Nutritional HealingBy way of introduction, my name is Douglas Brown, a Missouri licensed Insurance Agent/Broker. I have 23 years of experience in the Insurance industry representing every type of coverage available. For the last 16 years I have been self employed and specialized in group benefits for small businesses.Pertinent to my statement, it is important that I mention I have also served as a Removal Agent, on an As Needed basis, for the second largest Mortuary in St. Louis from 2008 to 2013. During that time span I transported over 1000 bodies. Functional Medicine, while in its' infancy, is one of the fastest growing fields I have ever witnessed. Why? Because the general health of our nation has reached serious and alarming negative status. The financial impact is not any better. How do I know this? Insurance applications. We have reached the point where, for the most part, only people in their twenties can answer \"NO\" to the list of questions regarding chronic or acute medical conditions! The headliners causing either declinations or stiff rate increases are well known because of their widespread presence: Diabetes, Heart and Lung deficiencies, Kidney and Gall Bladder stones, Inflamed bones and the Leader of the Pack...Obesity. From my Mortuary experiences I have noticed stunning realities. People of average height that weigh over 400 lbs will die in their mid- sixties. The oldest morbidly obese corpse I encountered was 65 years old. A statistic I read in an insurance study claimed 60% of our population is obese, meaning overweight to the point of health jeopardy.From a financial perspective, one of the largest health insurance carriers in America stated that the reason for highly inflated insurance premiums was due to the perversion of the basic rule of insurance: Many insured pay low premiums to cover few claims. That basic business principle is now reversed: Fewer insureds pay high premiums to cover outlandish numbers of claims. Functional Medicine is growing wildly by taking the opportunity to be the healing supply to the overwhelming demand of the sick. Basic economics. It is a return to the healing proof of Hippocrates, \"All health comes from the gut'. Just as traditional Western Medicine physicians need specialist support professions, like nursing, so it is with Functional Medicine physicians. They depend on nutritional specialists to teach patients how to form nutrition habits necessary for slower healing methods to accomplish lifelong successes. Universities across our country are answering the clarion call to produce such Nutritional Specialists. Their curriculums focus on how food affects the body's systems so the graduates are equipped to help patients to understand the methodology of eliminating foods that irritate them. I have experimented with Functional Medicine physicians and Nutritional support coaches. My goal was to end the lifelong therapy of medications. To date, these physicians and specialists have helped me stop my GERD condition by eliminating foods my body could not tolerate. Consequently, I have also eliminated the medication. Through the same process I have eliminated a daily nasal spray. My digestive system is working with precision, my energy level is rising steadily and my weight and facial coloring have returned to normal.Functional Medicine will flourishbecause it offers an alternative that works. Instead of using quick response lifelong medication therapies to control conditions, it teaches a discipline of ingestion that removes the irritation...for life.Thank you for considering licensing these Functional Specialists in our great state. It is easy to see the demand here. Having traveled throughout Missouri insuring school districts for traditional healthcare insurance, I watched the birth of \"Wellness Fairs\". It was then and is now a marvelous program teaching employees strategies to improve their health and therefore lower their cost of insurance. I can site numerous examples of organizations that have made large cuts in their costs, not only in insurance premiums but also in significant drops in both absenteeism and presenteeism - employees at work but too sick to be productive.Our State and Our Country need to support this fledgling industry through licensure. Please make Missouri a wellness programmed State and an example of how government can help constituents flourish in health and prosperity.Respectfully,Douglas BrownBenefits Alliance LLC314-610-4015 2/24/2021 COMMITTEE: Professional Registration and Licensing FOR INFORMATIONAL PURPOSES IN OPPOSITION TO IN SUPPORT OF TESTIFYING: WITNESS NAME THIS FORM IS PUBLIC RECORD UNDER CHAPTER 610, RSMo.

My name is Emily Fitzgibbons and I am writing to you in support of HB 475. I am a Certified Personal Trainer, Certified Nutritional Therapy Practitioner, and a Registered Medical Assistant. I know and adhere to a scope of practice that does not involve medical nutrition therapy. I do not treat, cure, or diagnose illnesses or diseases. I chose not to take the Registered Dietician path because I wanted a more whole body approach to health and wellbeing. I did not want to work in a hospital but instead wanted to build a practice that focuses on keeping people out of the hospital. Currently the law prohibits me from providing an individualized approach to nutrition. This restricts me from potentially helping someone to make a food plan based off of their recommendations made by a licensed provider. Our current health system is overwhelmed and we have seen that first hand this past year. There simply are not enough Registered Dieticians in the state of Missouri to provide all the necessary help and guidance that your constituents need to strengthen the health of our communities. By passing this bill we could be part of the answer needed to relieve our over-burdened medical institutions. With the click of a mouse you can do a quick search on the internet and find tons of different articles and blogs with all kinds of misleading nutritional information. Passing this bill will give more people like me the green light to seek quality continuing education in this field, which in turn can improve the health of so many more.

Dear Committee Members hearing HB 475,I ask that you please support HB 475. I am a Functional Nutritional Therapy Practitioner and also both a volunteer and Board member of my local food pantry in Polk County. Due to my weekly exposure to Missourians who are struggling with food security, I can speak directly to the importance of these folks having access to food education. I see a lot of people in our county who are both dealing with poverty and at the same time have chronic lifestyle diseases. It saddens me greatly that I have the education, training, and knowledge to help the people I see every week, but due to the current law, I cannot work with them one-on-one and offer them personalized solutions.That is what people like me do.

Dear Committee Members Hearing HB 475I am a clinical psychologist who has worked with a health coach both personally and professionally. In doing so, I improved nutrition knowledge and dietary options for my family and incorporated this information when working with clients who were seeking to improve their overall health. As a mental health provider, I have come to recognize and value the connection between \"food and mood.\" However, most professionals in my field and also the medical field lack this vital information. This is something I was guilty of before working with a health coach. In fact, more research supports the notion that Food is Medicine, not only for physical but also for mental health and wellbeing.As a professional working to improve the quality of life for others, working with, learning from, and referring my clients to a nutritional health coach is vital. Missourians need more options, access, and resources for food education outside of working with a dietitian. In my experience, underserved individuals could benefit the most from health coaches who have more access to and, perhaps, more training to serve those with chronic lifestyle diseases better. These professionals offer a different stance on food and health and are more than qualified to serve those in need. Allowing more professionals in this field to work far outweighs any argument why they should not.Please support HB 475! Give these professionals the chance to work and those who choose to work with them the chance at better health.Thank you,Erin Maclin, Psy.D.

Thank you for considering this legislation. Access to healthcare is one of the most important benefits for Missourians. Healthcare is as important as food and shelter. If our residents are not healthy, it makes it difficult for them to contribute to their own well-being and to benefit our communities. By allowing health coaches to also educate Missourians on how they can better take care of themselves, you will improve access to this kind of information to more of our residents. In my personal experience in working with health coaches, they are able to help Missourians not only understand what foods to eat but also how to make it easier to access, store, and prepare food. By teaching individuals how to make it easier to eat healthy, they will be more successful in their endeavor to stay healthy. By making this modification, you will be increasing access to knowledge and individualized care for Missourians. This is about providing our Missourians with more resources especially in our rural communities.WITNESS APPEARANCE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES HB 475BILL NUMBER: DATE: 2/24/2021 COMMITTEE: Professional Registration and Licensing FOR INFORMATIONAL PURPOSES IN OPPOSITION TO IN SUPPORT OF TESTIFYING: WITNESS NAME INFORMATION ON THIS FORM IS PUBLIC RECORD UNDER CHAPTER 610, RSMo.WITNESS APPEARANCE FORMMISSOURI HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES HB 475BILL NUMBER: DATE: 2/24/2021 COMMITTEE: Professional Registration and Licensing FOR INFORMATIONAL PURPOSES IN OPPOSITION TO IN SUPPORT OF TESTIFYING: WITNESS NAME FORM IS PUBLIC RECORD UNDER CHAPTER 610, RSMo.

My name is Jen Brown, I live in Ballwin, and I am grateful to the entire committee for this opportunity. I am a National Board-Certified Integrative Nutrition Health and Wellness Coach and a member of the Missouri Nutrition Alliance. I support House Bill 475 and am asking that you please do the same. One of the unique aspects of health coaching versus other health professions, is the understanding and practice that coaching is a client centered relationship. Client focused, client driven, a model not able to be supported currently in our overburdened healthcare institutions. Our professional training makes our scope of practice very clear; we do not seek to diagnose, treat, or prescribe, in fact we refer our clients to licensed professionals for that course of action. We do, however, because of our training and the ability to assess and individualize, seek to educate, inspire, and empower our clients on lifestyle and dietary changes that are beneficial and unique to their own health and wellbeing.There are many roads to any destination, and this could not be truer in the realm of health and wellness. The positive impact of passing HB 475 is twofold at minimum. One, it provides Missourians more options of their choosing on their road to better health and wellbeing, more tools in the tool shed so to speak. And Secondly, it allows non licensed trained health professionals the opportunity to legally provide consistent and science-based nutrition advice reflecting the current dietary/nutrition information so that our clients may thrive. Both of the above contributing significantly to the better health of our fellow Missourians.

Dear Committee Members, I am writing to express my support for House Bill No. 475. I am a licensed Chiropractor in the state of Missouri and have been in practice for close to 12 years now. Throughout my years in practice, I have seen so many patients suffering with everything from traditional neck pain, back pain and sciatica to auto-immune diseases, cancer, diabetes, heart disease, obesity, etc. The truth is that so many people in our state and our county are sick with multiple issues but boil down to similar causes. As I recall statistics that I've learned over the years, such as 5/6 Americans will be diagnosed with either heart disease or cancer at some point in their lives, 1/3 our our population is obese, 2/3 is overweight, along with many others, I'm reminded that our citizens need more help. So many are merely surviving but not really thriving as I believe God intended them to. My chiropractic education has taught me that the body is an incredible organism, capable of functioning, healing and adapting to stressors all on its own. Yet, there are still so many people who are sick and suffering. Why? The cause of the diseases so many struggle with can be reduced down to two causes: 1) a deficiency and/or 2) a toxicity. To function and heal properly, the body needs a positive mindset, proper nerve supply, essential nutrients, movement and a reduction or elimination of toxins. When it has these things, magic happens and healing occurs. But many in our general public don't have the first clue as to how to implement these things in their lives and bodies. The allopathic field recognizes that many disease our citizens suffer with are lifestyle diseases. So both the cause and the solution lie with lifestyle choices, such as proper nutrition. Yet, patients are not being properly coached as to how to make and implement better lifestyle choices. Instead, they are often just given a prescription that will suppression their symptoms, allowing them to keep making the same poor choices that got them sick in the first place for a while longer... but they don't get better. They just wind up needing more and more medications as they get sicker and sicker. There are so many health coaches and nutritionists that can truly help our public understand what foods are good for them, which ones are not and which ones they need to completely avoid to get well. Many of these practitioners have the desire, time, resources and education to truly coach sick individuals back to health/wellness. Unfortunately, I understand that the current legislation prohibits so many of them from being able to help where they can. It is my hope and my wish that this bill will pass so that more people can get the help they desire and deserve to truly change their health and their life. Please stand with me in supporting HB475.Sincerely,Dr. Jerod A. Posey, 2/24/2021 COMMITTEE: Professional Registration and Licensing FOR INFORMATIONAL PURPOSES IN OPPOSITION TO IN SUPPORT OF TESTIFYING: WITNESS NAME BUSINESS/ORGANIZATION: WITNESS NAME: THIS FORM IS PUBLIC RECORD UNDER CHAPTER 610, RSMo. Dear Members of the Committee for Professional Registration and Licensing,My name is Jessica Idleman, Executive Director of the Missouri Nutrition Alliance. I am also board certified by the National Association of Nutrition Professionals (NANP). The standards for our education, required by the NANP can be found in the additional documents you have received. The Missouri Nutrition Alliance is a non- profit dedicated to unifying the health coach/nutrition professional sector. There are many different kinds of these professionals. We seek to educate the public on these distinctions. The MNA has 2 areas of focus for community outreach. First, we educate health coaches and nutrition professionals about the guidelines for how they practice in Missouri and second, we mobilize our professional members and partners to assist in community outreach programs involving food education. Because of my position and experience I happen to know quite a bit about our industry. Some of it I believe this committee would find compelling. For example: We know that there are definitely hundreds, potentially thousands of people in this state who have invested a lot of time and money in nutrition training programs only to learn after the fact that can't use this training legally. These people in no way identify as a dietitian. They do not want to work in a hospital. Health coaches are very aware that they are not clinicians. They are more comparable to personal trainers. They do not diagnose, treat, or cure disease. However they are trained to assess. They ARE trained to know when to refer out to medical providers.These are not \"weekend certifications programs\" these coaches are going through. We recognize weekend programs as continuing education units, (CEUs), which are required to maintain credentials from legitimate programs. The certification programs the MNA recognizes last at least a year. Many programs last 2 or more years. These programs provide more than enough training for an individual to assess things like a client's dietary preferences and needs regarding food education. They do not offer training in \"medical\" nutrition therapy. Because the current law does not include them they either disappear or fly under the radar. In other words, they aren't helping others overcome lifestyle diseases like diabetes, and heart disease. In many cases they are practicing but they aren't opening up brick and mortars, hiring employees, or paying taxes on monies earned that they otherwise could be because they are afraid of getting seen and reported by a dietitian.This industry isn't going away. It continues to grow worldwide. States across the country continue to overturn these restrictive and outdated laws. Health coaches do not want to be dietitians and not because they're trying to cheat or because they aren't smart enough. It is different work that overlaps with a dietitians training in some ways. It is not medical nutrition therapy and therefore does not devalue licensure or require it. The problem is not that these people are unqualified, the problem is that opposition does not want competition. The MNA supports this bill and asks that this committee do the same. If we had somepurposeful language amending the existing Dietetics Practice Act that was inclusive to other professionals, we'd be creating new jobs, precise guidelines for other professionals to practice safely, as well as more access to those who desperately need proper food education.Thank you,Jessica IdlemanExecutive Director Missouri Nutrition 475BILL NUMBER: DATE: 2/24/2021 COMMITTEE: Professional Registration and Licensing FOR INFORMATIONAL PURPOSES IN OPPOSITION TO IN SUPPORT OF TESTIFYING: WITNESS NAME BUSINESS/ORGANIZATION: WITNESS NAME: JONATHAN THIS FORM IS PUBLIC RECORD UNDER CHAPTER 610, RSMo. Dear Members of the Committee:On behalf of the Council of Holistic Health Educators, our member schools and 5,000+ holistic practitioners in Missouri, we are writing to ask for your support of HB 475. Our practitioners, most of whom are women small business owners, do not diagnose, treat, or cure diseases. They provide clients with actionable advice, guidance, and recommendations for better health and wellness, based on an assessment of that client's eating habits. This bill would allow those 5,000+ practitioners to open or expand their business, ask questions and provide non-medical support for healthier eating, and diet. It will immediately open up the practice of nutrition to more professionals, which has been unfairly monopolized by a single modality for almost 30 years, with no verifiable proof that its needed, wanted by the public, or beneficial to the state. It is arguable that the dietitian practice act has done more to harm Missouri's ability to care for its citizens. According to the Missouri Department of Professional Registration, as of January 1st the state licenses approximately 2,300 Dietitian Nutritionists. This is down from 2,414 in 2019, which amounts to approximately one dietitian for every 2,668 residents. This is a deficit that an exemption to licensure to ask questions, assess a person's food and nutrition intake, provide advice, and support, will quickly fill. Presently the law requires that a person hold a license to talk to individuals about food and nutrition, specifically to assess a person's current nutrition status - asking questions about food and eating. It also requires a license to provide individualized support in response to those questions, such as changes in diet, meal planning, food preparation, and to help Missourians make better diet and nutrition choices. Despite large numbers of qualified professionals in the state, the law has done more to protect the value of a private credential - required for licensure - than it has to improve the public health. Only sixteen states require a license to provide individualized food, diet, and nutrition services. The other 34 do not, even though some may still have a dietetics practice act in the law, that law does not require a license to provide such services. You may hear horror stories of unlicensed practitioners causing great harm to the public, or the dangers of dietary supplements. What you will not hear is anything that can be independently verified. You will be asked to take the word of a monopoly over the free marketplace, despite no threat of actual harm. Dietary supplements are part of our everyday lives and you can buy them almost anywhere. Our 5,000+ practitioners do not diagnose, treat, or attempt to cure diseases, nor do they \"prescribe\" anything. They do not use protected titles, attempt to practice medicine, or give the impression they can. All they want to do is educate and provide actionable recommendations for eating and living better, which current law does not allow them to do. Just in the past 3 years, states like Maine, North Carolina, and Florida have added exemptions to their dietetics practice laws, and not a single person has been harmed. If there was a threat of actual harm from unlicensed food, diet, and nutrition practitioners, we would have heard about it by now from one of those 34 states. The threat of actual harm for providing food and nutrition advice is so low that one million dollars in liabilityinsurance for an unlicensed nutrition professional costs about $245 per year. Nationwide. If the insurance market sees no discernible difference in the threat of harm from licensed dietitians and unlicensed holistic practitioners, then the state must consider if the monopoly is doing more harm than good. HB 475 will take the government out of the equation so that Missourians no longer need permission from the government to talk with individuals for remuneration about food, or to ask questions about something that has become ubiquitous in our lives. Dietitians can keep their license, but they will no longer have a monopoly. I urge you to not be swayed by unverifiable horror stories of dietary supplements, unlicensed practice, and dangerous people talking about food without a license. The issue is that one group has a monopoly, while others are seeking to enter the marketplace in order to compete. Competition is a good thing, and I ask for you to please give it a chance by supporting HB 475.

Dear Committee Members Hearing HB 475,Thank you for considering HB475. This is an important piece of legislation that impacts me directly. I have a unique background as a licensed CPA and a functional nutritionist. After a history of surgeries and medications, which only resulted in the further declining of my health, I decided to seek a formal education. After going to school for training in functional nutrition, I was able to learn how to use food for function, and how to make sustainable lifestyle changes that have changed how I live. I went from just trying to survive each day - to thriving! I work with medical doctors that understand their patients need help creating healthy habits and lifestyles. These doctors don't have the time to provide that amount of ongoing support. They refer to me to help their patients gain an understanding of how to use food for function - to help them interpret food labels, navigate the grocery store, help with daily consistent energy, help with properly digesting their food, and so much more. In my accounting profession, you are able to work using your accounting training, license or no license. If you choose to become licensed, you can represent yourself as a CPA. Whether you are licensed or not, you are still able to work in our state using your education and training. It is ultimately up to the consumer to decide what kind of accounting professional, licensed or not, for their accounting needs. The law does not restrict someone with accounting education and training from working individually with others because they are not licensed. Restricting educated and trained health professionals, like myself, from using their education and training in this state hurts Missourians. There are Missourians that need help and want the choice in the approach taken for their individual needs. It also hurts Missourians from working and earning a living, like me, who are more than qualified to help others at this capacity. The current law continues to stifle job creation and hinders the health of your constituents. Passing this piece of legislation is absolutely essential to allowing Missourians the choice in helping them to overcome lifestyle illnesses. Allowing more professionals in this field to work far outweigh any argument why they should not. Missouri is far more restrictive than other states on this issue and Missourians just keep getting sicker. Passing this legislation is one more step in helping Missourians understand that disease is not inevitable, health is!

I am writing to urge you to please pass HB475. I have 13.5 years of experience and training in integrative oncology. According to the CDC, an unhealthy diet is a risk factor for 13 types of cancer (making up 40% of all cancers). I am seeing a heart-breaking number of young people in their 20's, 30's and 40's in rural Missouri developing these cancers. We have a severe lack of access to licensed dietitians in our rural area, and people too often are not getting enough time or education when they can see a dietitian. I've seen young people on fast food diets developing colon cancer in our area. An ovarian cancer patient with severe weight loss reported that she only got a few minutes with her hospital dietitian and she left with all of her questions unanswered. We have a severe lack of access problem that is exacerbated by the law as it currently stands. As our laws stand now, many well- educated and trained professionals are being shut out from serving this unmet need, thus creating a lack of access to essential care in our state. In many cases, these nutrition professionals have significantly more training on food therapy and micronutrients than the average doctor, nurse or other licensed professionals with \"nutrition\" listed in their scope of practice. It would be far safer and more effective to have these additional trained professionals help address this lack of access problem instead of people finding dietary misinformation on the internet to meet this unmet need. Please support HB475.WITNESS APPEARANCE FORMMISSOURI HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES HB 475BILL NUMBER: DATE: 2/24/2021 COMMITTEE: Professional Registration and Licensing FOR INFORMATIONAL PURPOSES IN OPPOSITION TO IN SUPPORT OF TESTIFYING: WITNESS THIS FORM IS PUBLIC RECORD UNDER CHAPTER 610, RSMo. Dear Committee Members HB 475An important piece of legislation, HB 475, is the reason I am writing to today. I can attest to the importance of providing people with more access to food education in the state of Missouri. I want to, as someone who is a health coach and has worked with a nutrition professional other than a dietitian, stress how valuable are the services they provide. While I am not a clinician, I am able to assist in the health of Missourians and provide an invaluable service that is different and does not take away from the importance of a dietician. I am trained as a health coach and work within my scope of practice. In order to help, having the ability to asses someone is important. Access to dieticians can be limited especially in rural areas. While people wait for access, they continue to be sick. The field of health and wellbeing provides benefits from professionals that far out way the risks.In my life, I have faced health challenges. My healthcare team is invaluable to me and I am thankful for them. These individuals have assisted me in learning how to make certain changes in my life in order to improve it. Because of my own health journey and the inspiration of those who assisted me, I chose health coaching.The current law provides challenges for me to do my job successfully and meet the needs of my clients.

Thank you for considering HB 475. I am in full support. As the founder of the St. Louis Institute of Integrative Medicine, I realize the importance and need for health coaches in our state. I work closely with physicians and clinicians of all specialties in the area and their biggest complaint is having not having capacity to assist their patients in lifestyle change. They simply do not have the time or the resources to meet this demanding need. The use of health coaches is imperative for patient success in their treatment plan. Doctors tell patients to go home and \"eat better, reduce their stress, move more, and reduce inflammation.\" This is an extremely tall order for someone whose current lifestyle behaviors is what created their problem in the first place. They are given zero direction from their PCP on how to even begin this daunting lifestyle change. Health coaches are instrumental and are part of the solution. They are the hand holders, guides, and the ones with the true education on making lifestyle change permanent. They kindly give the direction that so many patients are lacking. With their support, the patient is able to fulfill on the goals that both the doctor and the patient have set. From a functional medicine standpoint, the dietitians are not helpful. They are using old science such as the food pyramid/my plate. No wonder we have so much diabetes, when your main food group comes from refined carbohydrates! The Mediterranean diet is the most studied diet to date. That's not what is being taught by dietitians! They need to be versed in ways of eating such as the autoimmune, Paleo and anti- inflammatory diets. Dietitians are simply not trained on this forward thinking of effective lifestyle diet direction. The health coaches that we work with in our organization are extremely professional, highly knowledgeable about food and supplementation. This delivers the best outcomes. We need Missouri to step up and progress with the latest in heath research like functional medicine. Functional medicine is a huge proponent for health coaches and preaches that they are our answer to this \"sick care\" pandemic. We have been in this situation for far too many decades. The Missouri Nutrition Alliance is extremely important and allows the medical providers in our organization to have a trusted and vetted resource when looking for lifestyle and nutrition guidance for their patients. I ask that you please support this bill and give your constituents the access they desperately need to find health.

Otherwise my options would have been limited. Our families in Missouri need more health and wellness education and access is extremely limited.

I appreciate the opportunity to voice my support for HB 475. As an RN of 29 years, I have witnessed the toll that poor diet has taken on society. I have always found it odd that we never seem to focus on what people are placing in their bodies. Instead, we hand out prescriptions hand over fist. I have to say that I didn't question this as much years ago as I do today. My view of traditional medicine has done a complete 180. While I still agree that we need acute care, chronic illness has gone off the rails. In my last few years at an outpatient surgery center, it became unbearable to hear the doctor discuss the new prescription or continuation of a prescription that would never address the underlying issue. I had to find another way to help people. Introducing people to functional medicine and integrative wellness practitioners is truly changing health outcomes. No longer treating a symptom but addressing the underlying issue. Most of the time it is a gut issue or inflammatory issue exacerbated by processed and inflammatory foods.I witnessed my own health change when I supported the gut and invested in sensitivity testing and had someone to guide me on the best ways to support my gut biome. This is not my forte. I don't aspire to take this on. However, I want to have these professionals at my side to get patients on the path to true health and wellness. I will just share a story. My daughter was diagnosed with Hashimoto's autoimmune thyroiditis at the age of 13, prediabetic, hair falling out, brittle nails, fatigue, yet not overweight. Diet was the main change for this young lady that met it head-on with the information provided by professionals like these. If we would have visited a normal dietician I believe we would still be fighting this beast. My daughter is now 18. She put her autoimmune into remission 1- 2 months after addressing what she was putting in her body. Her hair is thick and luscious, she works out every day and has wonderful muscle mass, energy to meet all her daily tasks and reversed her pre- diabetic state. Can we not agree that this is what we should be providing for our families, especially our most precious asset, our children? It is time to untie the hands of the people that can truly make a difference in the true epidemic which is chronic illness.

Missourians are currently being denied access to nutritionists and life style coaching professionals because Missouri is a restrictive Exclusive Scope of Practice state. It permits licensure to practice in Missouri only to registered Dieticians who then have a monopoly on dietary education here. Does that make sense--in an era when Diabetes, Hypertension, and Obesity, (all amenable to life style change), impact our cost of public health care so dramatically? Should we not be thinking of ways to encourage prevention and reduce progression of disease by allowing access to well trained professionals who can assist in making positive, healthy choices? It's clear from research--Healthy people live longer, healthy people work longer, healthy people pay taxes, rather than place more burden on health care system. There are not nearly enough nutritionally educated professionals in Missouri to adequately address the issues. In a state where one third of our adults are prediabetes, at a cost of $6.7 billion annually, dieticians need help. trained nutritionists now work for the federal government and in 36 other states. Let's make it happen in Missouri.From personal experience:I am an at risk- senior who contracted the Covid-19 Virus in November of 2020. As my symptoms escalated to pneumonia status, My primary care physician recommended hospitalization; but the local facility was over capacity and ambulances were on diversion mode. The physician prescribed medication to address the pneumonia. I contacted a well trained, multiply certified nutritionist and health care coach who would like to practice in Missouri but cannot due to the restrictions here . She recommended non-medical interventions to address multiple symptoms. I, like many Covid patients had not slept in days. She suggested strategies that had me asleep within hours. A dietician is not trained to do that. My coach recommended non-medical intervention for debilitating headaches which were alleviated within two days. A dietician is not trained to do that. My coach suggested non-medical intervention to increase circulation to get more oxygen into my body, and recommend nutrients to jumpstart my immune system and speed recovery. A dietician is not trained to do that. I am proof that nutritionists are NOT \"quacks\" who kill people . They are skilled, highly trained consummate professionals who would add another resource to total health care in our state. Please allow them to do so.Thank you for your considerationWITNESS APPEARANCE 475BILL NUMBER: DATE: 2/24/2021 COMMITTEE: Professional Registration and Licensing FOR INFORMATIONAL PURPOSES IN OPPOSITION TO IN SUPPORT OF TESTIFYING: WITNESS THIS FORM IS PUBLIC RECORD UNDER CHAPTER 610, RSMo.WITNESS APPEARANCE FORMMISSOURI HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES HB 475BILL NUMBER: DATE: 2/24/2021 COMMITTEE: Professional Registration and Licensing FOR INFORMATIONAL PURPOSES IN OPPOSITION TO IN SUPPORT OF TESTIFYING: WITNESS INFORMATION ON THIS FORM IS PUBLIC RECORD UNDER CHAPTER 610, RSMo. Thank you for considering this important piece of legislation. I personally know Brandy Hickman and am married to and related to many people in various medical professions and I can attest to the value that is provided to individuals in the work of nutrition and health coaching. There is great value and importance in providing people with more access to food education in the state of Missouri. People are not educated in the benefits of food. Our society norm is to eat processed and fast food rather than healthy food. Our people are getting more obese and less healthy. There is no downside to offering more options for people to access education and information. It seems counter-intuitive to limit access in an area of such great need. If the current access was enough to alter and direct the health of our citizens nobody would spend the time or energy to pursue other options. Allowing more professionals in this field to work far outweighs any argument why they should not. This is about access to qualified individuals who are available to consumers who want to be empowered with the freedom of choice for their health. Thank you for your support!Margo SpildeWITNESS APPEARANCE 2/24/2021 COMMITTEE: Professional Registration and Licensing FOR INFORMATIONAL PURPOSES IN OPPOSITION TO IN SUPPORT OF TESTIFYING: WITNESS NAME THIS FORM IS PUBLIC RECORD UNDER CHAPTER 610, RSMo. The more I have learned about healthy eating and preparing healthy meals, the more Im concerned about the American people getting education about food that will ultimately give them a better quality of life and keep medical bills down!I want everyone to be able to be educated on great food choices, the importance of limited sugar, and sodium intake, useless calories etc! Having access to food education would be a win-win for every American, buying local food products and making healthy choices would impact so many peope's lives! Everyone should be educated about the bad things they are ingesting and the great food choices that will change their lives!WITNESS APPEARANCE FORMMISSOURI HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES HB 475BILL NUMBER: DATE: 2/24/2021 COMMITTEE: Professional Registration and Licensing FOR INFORMATIONAL PURPOSES IN OPPOSITION TO IN SUPPORT OF TESTIFYING: WITNESS NAME THIS FORM IS PUBLIC RECORD UNDER CHAPTER 610, RSMo. Thank you for considering this important piece of legislation. As someone who lives in southwest Missouri and as a healthcare professional myself, I can attest to the importance of providing people with more access to food education in the state of Missouri. People are often times lacking in education around nutrition and how to adhere to specific needs that might related to their chronic conditions such as heart failure or diabetes. Access to a dietician is extremely limited, particularly in rural areas. These professionals do something different from dietitians and they are more than qualified to fill this educational or coaching need within the community. Allowing more professionals in this field to work far outweigh any argument why they should not. During this pandemic the utilization of healthcare resources across our state is so important- if community support and education can avoid a hospitalization or worse a poor patient outcome; this could truly help save a life. This really should be about consumer choice and providing your constituents with more options.WITNESS APPEARANCE FORMMISSOURI HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES HB 475BILL NUMBER: DATE: 2/24/2021 COMMITTEE: Professional Registration and Licensing FOR INFORMATIONAL PURPOSES IN OPPOSITION TO IN SUPPORT OF TESTIFYING: WITNESS COACH ADDRESS: MELESHA BAILEY-CERTIFIED NUTRITIONAL HEALTH COACH AND OWNER OF LOVE 4 LIFE WELLNESS. GRADUATE FROM THE INSTITUTE OF THIS FORM IS PUBLIC RECORD UNDER CHAPTER 610, RSMo. Dear Senate CommitteeThank you for considering that SB 475 is an essential piece of legislation that directly impacts me and my livelyhood. I am a Nutritional Health Coach and my story of overcoming years of illness begins with me going through training to become a health coach. It took me a long time to get better, as we do not diagnose, treat, or cure disease. However, I learned how to clean up my diet and make those changes sustainable, which ultimately reversed my diabetes, fibromyalgia, morbid obesity, and other chronic illnesses, Many restrictions are placed on people like me from using their educational training in Missouri hurts people like me who need more individualized attention than what they have access to in the existing medical model.It also hurts people like me who are more than qualified to help others in this capacity. Because we are restricted to do so, we aren't opening up businesses, hiring employees, or paying taxes on monies earned. The current law continues to restrain job creation and hinders the health of your constituents. Passing this piece of legislation is absolutely essential to getting people the help they need to overcome lifestyle diseases.

Thank you for considering this important piece of legislation. As someone who currently works in the field of wellbeing, I can attest to the need of people who are able to work with others, providing education and insight with regard to nutrition. We are in crisis; our obesity rates are climbing and the comorbidities associated with this are stressing an already over-stressed medical system. We need more access to people who have strong credentials in this area and there are not enough registered dieticians to serve our population in need. Additionally, many people cannot afford to see an RD. This fills a gap in care, allowing for us to serve our population in a more effective and efficient manner.WITNESS APPEARANCE FORMMISSOURI HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES HB 475BILL NUMBER: DATE: 2/24/2021 COMMITTEE: Professional Registration and Licensing FOR INFORMATIONAL PURPOSES IN OPPOSITION TO IN SUPPORT OF TESTIFYING: WITNESS NAME THIS FORM IS PUBLIC RECORD UNDER CHAPTER 610, RSMo. I would like to thank you for considering this legislation. I have been working with a nutritionist and am amazed at how nutrition benefits the mind, body, and soul. I was frankly shocked to find out that most Doctors have an average of six hours training on nutrition while in medical school. SERIOUSLY????? Six hours?? How can this be? Upon further research I found that dietitians who work in the hospital setting are regulated on how they can advise people because of hospital or insurance regulations. So many people cannot afford to see a nutritionist so they are referred to a hospital dietitian where they get very little information due only to the fact that the insurance will cover the muted dietician. The fact is that nutritionists are squelched by the powers that be (be it hospitals or pharmaceuticals) so that medication instead of knowledge and good healthy eating are sold to the patient. It is a known fact that obesity and all of the related diseases are out of control in this country. It is the responsibility of our elected officials to look out for OUR best interest. I was recently hospitalized for five days with COVID- 19 and was amazed when I ordered two cartons of chocolate milk for breakfast only to find out that I could only have one due to the sodium content. When I read the label on the one carton that I was allowed I discovered that it was loaded with sugar. Zero fat, but loaded with sugar. I read over the hospital menu and wished that a McDonalds was in the facility so that I could get healthier choices of food. PLEASE, PLEASE, PLEASE consider this bill for your constituents. Our lives depend on it.WITNESS APPEARANCE FORMMISSOURI HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES HB 475BILL NUMBER: DATE: 2/24/2021 COMMITTEE: Professional Registration and Licensing FOR INFORMATIONAL PURPOSES IN OPPOSITION TO IN SUPPORT OF TESTIFYING: WITNESS THIS FORM IS PUBLIC RECORD UNDER CHAPTER 610, RSMo. To Whom it May Concern:I am in support of this bill as proposed. In my understanding this would in no way create undue harm to the community nor would it step on the proverbial toes of the dietetics community. This bill is mainly providing a way for greater holistic access and education - which is in dire need. It would not cause for individuals to go outside of their scope or expertise, but to merely be a guide and referral source for greater understanding. In my opinion, any disease mitigation that can be conducted is a win for people and the community at large; to move away from a disease management system to true healthcare and disease prevention model.WITNESS APPEARANCE FORMMISSOURI HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES HB 475BILL NUMBER: DATE: 2/24/2021 COMMITTEE: Professional Registration and Licensing FOR INFORMATIONAL PURPOSES IN OPPOSITION TO IN SUPPORT OF TESTIFYING: WITNESS NAME THIS FORM IS PUBLIC RECORD UNDER CHAPTER 610, RSMo. Thank you for giving sincere thought to this extremely important legislation. I am a pelvic health physical therapist and the clients I see often have devastating bowel and bladder symptoms that render them unable to return to work and the family responsibilities and joys that the rest of us take for granted. I will spare you the graphic details. Please know, the root cause of why their symptoms even started and have now become unbearable is almost always because of their nutritional choices. If nutrition is not addressed, the rest of the treatment is like tying to put small bandaids on gaping wounds. I had tried to get access to nutritionists in the past and my hospital system restricted who could be referred as well as there was a long waiting list. Cost and physical access - the ability to get to a nutritionist was often prohibitive as well.I have seen firsthand the benefits of having access to a nationally board certified health coach and the positive effects of helping someone to be accountable in their kitchen. I have personally seen Brandy Hickman educate to make the kitchen a place of enjoyment and nourishment instead of total overwhelm and toxins. I am confident that I can refer a client to her and this individual will be in the safest of hands. These health coaches have sat before the National Board of Medical Examiners and know their craft! Please allow Missourians freedom of choice and access to a healthy future!

Chairmen, members of the committee,I am sorry that I can not be with you today.My name is Renee Weissend and I live in Kansas City, Missouri. When I was diagnosed with multiple sclerosis in June of 2003. I was told by my doctors that the best thing I could do is take an MS drug and don't look on the Internet -there was nothing I could do to change the progression of my crippling disease. On my 39th birthday I did start on that drug and continued the Avonex injection for over 10 years, dealing with the 2 days of flu-like symptoms weekly. Knowing that I did not want any of our four children to follow me on this journey, I started to search the internet for hope. That search brought me to Dr. Terry Wahls. Dr. Wahls, an Iowan, who after being diagnosed with MS, began a rapid physical decline. She tried all the best treatments medicine could offer her and without success she began her own search for ways to alter the course of her disease. Her research brought her back to the basics and \"real food\". Dr. Wahls changed her diet and lifestyle and began to reverse her disease. Dr. Wahls went from using a reclining wheelchair to riding her bicycle. Dr. Wahls gave me hope. She started me on this journey of using real food to heal. I knew in my heart that I needed to learn more about a \"real food\" lifestyle. Already having a Bachelor of Science degree in chemical engineering and a master's degree in applied statistics, I knew I didn't wan to attend traditional college. I wanted focused learning. My search brought me to the Nutritional Therapy Association. The fact-based education I received was set on the foundation that wellness begins with a \"properly prepared nutrient dense diet\" and that everyone is a bio-individual. No two people are alike. I have been teaching a five-week group class. This class teaches about how digestion works and how sugar, fat and protein are used by the body. We also include a 21-day real food challenge. The a-ha moments are too numerous to count and my participants always feel so much better after the class is completed. The problem arises when someone wants to work with me individually, to dig deeper. Law does not allow this.I still have MS, but am proud to say that I have been MS drug free since July 2019. This occurred only after many discussions with my neurologist and a year of weaning drugs from my body. I feel better than I have in a long time. I still have that neurologist and know he will support me if I have changes, but he will be the first one to say that he rarely has a patient who is willing to dive into diet and lifestyle as I have. He rarely has a patient as stable as I am. My ultimate goal is to be able to play on the floor with my future grandchildren. I don't want to stop climbing mountains. I would be honored to be able to support individuals in using a nutrient dense diet and lifestyle changes to achieve their own goals. Thank you for your time.Renee Weissend, FNTPWITNESS 2/24/2021 COMMITTEE: Professional Registration and Licensing FOR INFORMATIONAL PURPOSES IN OPPOSITION TO IN SUPPORT OF TESTIFYING: WITNESS NAME THIS FORM IS PUBLIC RECORD UNDER CHAPTER 610, RSMo.

Shannan Slaven's TestimonyHB475 Professional Registration Wednesday, February 17th 2pmMy name is Shannan Slavens. I am requesting the House Committee for Professional Registration to vote in favor of HB475. I am a consumer who is seeking the assistance of Health Coaching in my own life. I understand the value a Health Coach plays in my daily preventative health choices. I see a need for our Missouri communities to have access to this type of support. When working through healthcare decisions for ourselves and our family, both young and old, we need a support system to work in synergy with licensed dieticians and healthcare workers. Information received from our healthcare system is overwhelming to many. We want to make healthy choices with our lifestyle to enhance our treatments. We need an educator to fill this role.

Dear Committee Members Hearing HB 475Thank you for considering this important piece of legislation. I am 74 years old and recently went to a dietitian to get a handle on my weight and high cholesterol. I was struck by the thought that what I heard from the dietitian was pretty much the same as what I have heard for many years. I needed a new approach, maybe a little more tailored to my particular body, my age, etc. I needed someone to think out of the box. I got that with my health coach. I felt that when one approach didn't work we tried something else not the standard response that I had from the dietitian. I also learned more of the benefits of certain foods. Both approaches work but the results for me were better with a health coach.Please support HB 475! Give these professionals the chance to work and those who choose to work with them the chance at better health.

Thank you for considering this bill. As a person who has struggled to maintain a healthy weight all of her life, I think that the more access people have to information about ways to eat healthy the better. I have talked to dieticians in the past and the information they provided was very textbook and not practical. My experience with a \"health coach\" has been much different. They were able to meet me exactly where I am and give me practical ideas to improve my cooking methods. Allowing more professionals to assist people with their dietary needs seems like a simple solution to an ever-growing problem of people who desperately need help.WITNESS APPEARANCE OF REPRESENTATIVES HB 475BILL NUMBER: DATE: 2/24/2021 COMMITTEE: Professional Registration and Licensing FOR INFORMATIONAL PURPOSES IN OPPOSITION TO IN SUPPORT OF TESTIFYING: WITNESS NAME THIS FORM IS PUBLIC RECORD UNDER CHAPTER 610, RSMo.

Thank you, Committee Members, for hearing HB475, a bill that has the potential for a profound positive impact on the health and wellbeing of Missourians. My keen awareness of the impact food choices can have on an individual began about 6 years ago while I was living in a rural setting outside the United States. My young son suffered with chronic stomach and joint pain. The medical system there was already taxed beyond capacity with critical cases of illness and injury so common in developing nations, so I looked around at my own resources to see how to help him feel better. As I read books, blogs, and first-hand accounts from medical doctors, holistic practitioners, and average citizens alike, I became aware that certain diet and lifestyle choices can have a profound impact on a person's wellbeing. As we experimented with food choices, it was evident that eating certain foods resulted in more pain and avoiding those helped him feel better. I was so excited to see these connections and his improvements first-hand, I decided to enroll in an educational program that would guide me in a science-based approach to holistic nutrition so that I could effectively educate and support others in their quest for improved health. For two years I have been studying in the rigorous and comprehensive program provided by the Nutrition Therapy Institute, and I look forward to completing the program 18 months from now. It is my goal to also earn the Board Certified in Holistic Nutrition (BCHN) credential awarded by the National Association of Nutrition Professionals (NANP) and maintain professional membership in that organization. Under the current law in Missouri, even with this education, board certification, and the continuing education required of members of the NANP, if I attempt to share my knowledge of nutrition with people, I could face punishment in the form of fines and jail time. To say that it breaks my heart to turn friends and neighbors away when they ask for my help to improve their health is not an exaggeration. It seems like the real crime would be keeping these valuable tools of my science-based education to myself. Please support HB475 and open up more resources for Missourians to get help experiencing the health and wellbeing they deserve by allowing holistic nutrition professionals to establish practices and share their hard-earned expertise with members of their communities. -Valerie Federwitz, 2/24/2021 COMMITTEE: Professional Registration and Licensing FOR INFORMATIONAL PURPOSES IN OPPOSITION TO IN SUPPORT OF TESTIFYING: WITNESS NAME THIS FORM IS PUBLIC RECORD UNDER CHAPTER 610, RSMo. I oppose HB475 due to the language affecting the licensure status of registered dietitians in Missouri. The information you are receiving from individuals in support of this bill is inaccurate. Missouri is among 47 total states that have some form of licensure or certification for dietitians, with 27 states having the same level as Missouri currently has. https://www.eatrightpro.org/advocacy/licensure/licensure-map There is widespread support for maintaining a license and certifications in order to protect the public. There are other nutrition professionals and health professionals who provide NUTRITION EDUCATION to the public already and are allowed to do so. This can be as cooking demonstrations and cooking classes, children's nutrition classes through the state extension office, WIC offices providing education to their clients, gardening classes, through social media, health and wellness coaches, and so on. Providing nutrition education and guidance for behavior change is a different action that performing a nutrition assessment. Registered dietitians perform NUTRITION ASSESSMENTS with clients in order to identify nutrition- related problems by assessing existing chronic illnesses that have specialized diets, food and medication interaction risks, signs of nutrient deficiencies such as hair loss, inflamed tongues, bleeding gums, spots on eyes, cracked lips, texture of fingernails, and muscle wasting. We assess lab values that may correspond with these physical findings and past medical history. Registered dietitians modify their assessment criteria for a child, a young adult, an active adult, or an elderly individual in a nursing home. We have the education and training to perform these assessments that goes above the day to day discussions of nutrition education and making behavior changes to improve our diets.Lastly, RDs are found in a wide variety of settings across Missouri, from schools, universities, grocery stores, physician clinics, employee wellness programs, private practice, nursing homes, community and state health department clinics, professional sports teams, and large and small hospitals - and in hospitals, in many departments including trauma, rehab, cardiac, diabetes, children and babies, renal and dialysis, weight management, oncology, and more. We are accessible by all Missourians in large and small communities, and more recently, via telehealth from a distance. We are here to serve Missourians and improve their health through optimal nutrition, which includes the process from assessment through education and then evaluating their progress. Please vote to oppose HB 475 and any changes to the dietitian practice act.WITNESS DATE: 2/24/2021 COMMITTEE: Professional Registration and Licensing FOR INFORMATIONAL PURPOSES IN OPPOSITION TO IN SUPPORT OF TESTIFYING: WITNESS THIS FORM IS PUBLIC RECORD UNDER CHAPTER 610, RSMo. Good morning. As a clinical dietitian working with veterans, I see the importance of maintaining the integrity of our profession firsthand. Veterans in our community are often mislead or given incorrect information by those who claim to be health professionals in the field of dietetics or nutrition, specifically those who lack the appropriate education and supervised practice hours that dietitians endure to obtain their registration and license. Supporting this bill would be harmful to both veterans and civilians throughout our state. It is an honor to serve those who served and to provide evidence- based recommendations observe improvements in their chronic medical conditions by implementing medical nutrition therapy provided by RD's, like myself. An unlicensed practitioner attempting to do the same job without the education and supervised practice house will be incredibly detrimental to one's health. On top of these concerns, are in a critical time of combating misinformation across the country, especially evidence-based health recommendations. The persistence of misinformation continues to attract consumers, who continue trialing interventions provided by individuals with no prior education or credentialing. These interventions are rarely based on scientific studies and can be harmful and are more often dangerous to the consumer. Allowing non-credentialed individuals to provide nutrition education and therapies is not only dangerous, but it completely underscores the education and intensives practices and studies dietitians complete in order to provide evidence-based and medically- sound recommendations based on an individual's needs. Therefore, as your constituent, a registered dietitian nutritionist with the St. Louis VA Medical Center and a member of Missouri Academy of Nutrition and Dietetics, I strongly oppose the changes proposed in HB475 relating to the Licensure of Dietitians.WITNESS DATE: 2/24/2021 COMMITTEE: Professional Registration and Licensing FOR INFORMATIONAL PURPOSES IN OPPOSITION TO IN SUPPORT OF TESTIFYING: WITNESS THIS FORM IS PUBLIC RECORD UNDER CHAPTER 610, RSMo.

My name is Allison Mills, and I am writing in opposition to HB 475. I have been a registered dietitian for 15 years, with 10 years as an RD at the John Cochran VA Medical Center in St. Louis, providing nutrition care to veterans. As a Missouri resident and registered dietitian, it is important that we ensure Missouri residents receive their care from the most qualified practitioners. Registered dietitians undergo specific training, which includes at minimum a 4 year bachelors degree, an internship, and have passed a national exam. Our education ensures that we are experts in our field and the most qualified to provide thorough nutrition assessments and interventions that benefit our patients. It also requires that we are bound by a specific code of ethics. It would be harmful to Missourians for anyone without the required training to provide nutrition assessments. Without proper training, we would be putting the public at risk for unqualified individuals to cause harm, however well intended.WITNESS APPEARANCE FORMMISSOURI HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES HB 475BILL NUMBER: DATE: 2/24/2021 COMMITTEE: Professional Registration and Licensing FOR INFORMATIONAL PURPOSES IN OPPOSITION TO IN SUPPORT OF TESTIFYING: WITNESS NAME THIS FORM IS PUBLIC RECORD UNDER CHAPTER 610, RSMo. The importance of licensure in the field of dietetics lies within our responsibilities to our patients, clients, and the communities in which we serve. We have received bachelor's and master's degrees, 1200 supervised practice hours, sat for an extensive exam to receive this licensure and additionally must obtain continuing education credit to maintain this credential. To do away with this requirement negates and nullifies all of the hard work practitioners put in to be qualified to call themselves dietitians. We utilize evidence-based science to diagnose and treat at the nutritional level utilizing the necessary steps instilled in the Nutrition Care Process to provide the best practice to our patient, clients, and communities. There are dangers in prescribing diets when one does not understand how food works in the body and with medications and supplements. Dietitians are highly qualified and trained to provide nutrition diagnoses for all disease states and dietary needs through examining diet histories, biochemical and anthropometric data, medical histories, and medications. Certain conditions have higher energy and protein requirements while others require restrictions of certain macronutrients, vitamins, and minerals. There are dangers even in just trying to help someone lose some weight and dietitians are educated and trained to do this safely, effectively, and sustainably. I am asking you to oppose this motion to protect the term Dietitian under all of its requirements and qualifications AND to protect the people from misinformed and money-seeking individuals who think they should be able practice without the same education, credentials, and licensure. Dietitians are healthcare professionals and should be regarded with the same respect and considerations as other healthcare professionals such as doctors, nurses, occupational and physical therapists, radiologists. The list is extensive and all have requirements to practice. Thank you for taking the time to read my testimony.WITNESS APPEARANCE FORMMISSOURI HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES HB 475BILL NUMBER: DATE: 2/24/2021 COMMITTEE: Professional Registration and Licensing FOR INFORMATIONAL PURPOSES IN OPPOSITION TO IN SUPPORT OF TESTIFYING: WITNESS NAME BUSINESS/ORGANIZATION: WITNESS NAME: AMY THIS FORM IS PUBLIC RECORD UNDER CHAPTER 610, RSMo. First and foremost, I am thankful that the health and wellness realm has increased in popularity and demand with not only the recent pandemic, but also obesity, diabetes, heart disease, cancer and overall health crisis the US faces. However, allowing someone without the proper training to make medical based decisions is something I'm not in support of. I, myself as a dietitian, went through a rigorous internship to prepare for these situations. Would you allow a medical doctor to practice medicine if they had not completed medical school? Simply taking classes or learning curriculum does not carry over into real life decision making when it comes to medical nutritional therapy. It is not only careless but can be dangerous.WITNESS APPEARANCE FORMMISSOURI HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES HB 475BILL NUMBER: DATE: 2/24/2021 COMMITTEE: Professional Registration and Licensing FOR INFORMATIONAL PURPOSES IN OPPOSITION TO IN SUPPORT OF TESTIFYING: WITNESS NAME INDIVIDUAL: THIS FORM IS PUBLIC RECORD UNDER CHAPTER 610, RSMo. Please ensure that Missouri's licensure law for the Registered Dietitian continues to protect the public from unqualified practitioners administering nutrition assessments to patients with nutrition-related diseases and medical conditions, thereby undermining the current licensure law.

I am opposed to HB 475. The minimum requirements of a licensed dietitian is to earn an accredited bachelor's degree, complete a dietetic internship, and pass the Commission on Dietetic Registration exam. Effective 2024, the minimum requirements of a licensed dietitian is to earn an accredited master's degree. These are the MINIMUM qualifications for a professional to provide nutrition services as a licensed dietitian. A google search will show that there are opportunities to obtain a health coach certification with the requirement for a professional degree. There is no comparison between the nutrition services provided by a professional with education in biochemistry, anatomy and physiology, food science and nutrition science along with 9 months of hands on supervised practicum, exam and continuing education requirements with a person who has obtained an online certification. Licensed dietitians utilize the nutrition care progress to interpret labs, identify potential drug-nutrient interactions, determine nutrition diagnosis and provide treatment recommendations. The role of the health coach is to support the treatment plan development by the licensed professional. The health coach may support our treatment plan by assisting with overcoming barriers, empowering our patient to stay on track with their treatment plan, and referring to experts and reputable resources. Allowing a non-professional staff member without the proper education, training and credentials to provide nutrition care could put our patients and the public at risk. We are already seeing the effects in our health care system with health coaches providing nutrition education that is not evidenced based. Thank you for your support.WITNESS APPEARANCE FORMMISSOURI HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES HB 475BILL NUMBER: DATE: 2/24/2021 COMMITTEE: Professional Registration and Licensing FOR INFORMATIONAL PURPOSES IN OPPOSITION TO IN SUPPORT OF TESTIFYING: WITNESS NAME INFORMATION ON THIS FORM IS PUBLIC RECORD UNDER CHAPTER 610, RSMo. As a future MD physician, with an awareness of the impact that registered dietitians (RDs) have in healthcare encounters, I am in opposition to HB 475. I believe that approval of this bill could place the safety of future patients at great risk. Registered dietitians are licensed after an intense 5+ year, 1200 hour+ education program, with evidence-based management strategies. Dietitians have a complex and deeper understanding of nutrition that allows them to understand how nutrition affects every part of the human body. They aren't just telling people how to eat or what to eat but instead utilize complex evidence-based tools to determine how to best care for their patients. Approval of this bill would allow incompetent individuals, with a training period of 6-9 months in non-evidence-based practice, to have the authority to assess the nutrition status of patients. That is incredibly absurd and shouldn't even be considered appropriate by an elected official. When you're talking about future patients' safety and lives, you want someone who is experienced and trained in evidence-based practice. Imagine going to the hospital, and your doctor only had 6-9 months of medical school training? You would be terrified thinking they're making life and death decisions regarding your health. There is a plethora of misinformation within our communities surrounding medical nutrition therapy and nutrition overall. For example, even as a medical student, I've encountered a patient who had someone tell them that they should only take a certain dietary supplement they saw on Facebook, without eating, to cure their rheumatoid arthritis. With that type of misinformation, these patients are at a greater risk of adverse health outcomes due to malnutrition. There's a reason that graduate programs like medical school, physical therapy training, other allied health professional training, and registered dietitian programs are intense and prolonged. It is to ensure that all future patients receive a high-quality healthcare experience that prolongs longevity. Approval of this bill would put the future lives of millions of Americans at risk. I implore you to consider keeping the licensure of registered dietitians in Missouri.WITNESS DATE: 2/24/2021 COMMITTEE: Professional Registration and Licensing FOR INFORMATIONAL PURPOSES IN OPPOSITION TO IN SUPPORT OF TESTIFYING: WITNESS NAME THIS FORM IS PUBLIC RECORD UNDER CHAPTER 610, RSMo. I have been a Registered Dietitian since 2007, and also have a Master's in Public Health - Nutrition. The training and education we receive exceeds that of anyone without the credentials of RD/RDN, and/or LD. I have experience with patients who, time and time again, do not see long-term success with the information given to them by unaccredited, unregistered, and unlicensed individuals. It is heartbreaking for me, but most importantly for them. It is ineffective and deceptive to allow anyone to give certain nutrition recommendations without adequate background. Earning registration as a dietitian requires years of education in physiology, biochemistry, behavior change and counseling, anatomy, policy and community program development and more, in addition to 1,200 hours (approximately over 7 months at 40 hours a week, cumulatively) of supervised practice with currently registered dietitians. We also have to earn 75 units of continuing education credit, every 5 years. We are required to practice using evidence-based guidelines, developed over years of research. The answer to fulfilling the need for more nutrition counseling per capita in this state, and increase the overall heath of Missourians, is not to allow those without this rigorous, protected background to provide it with less restrictions on the information given, but to increase low or no-cost access to Registered Dietitian Nutritionists for Missourians.WITNESS NUMBER: DATE: 2/24/2021 COMMITTEE: Professional Registration and Licensing FOR INFORMATIONAL PURPOSES IN OPPOSITION TO IN SUPPORT OF TESTIFYING: WITNESS NAME THIS FORM IS PUBLIC RECORD UNDER CHAPTER 610, RSMo.

I am writing you in opposition of this bill in order to protect our citizens from potential misinformation and misguidance. As we all know, there is a lot of conflicting, often false and misleading information in regards to nutrition. Too often, individuals and corporations use false and misguided nutrition information for personal gain which comes at the price of the health of ordinary citizens. Providing individualized nutrition recommendations and assessments should be based on evidenced based practice standards. Registered Dietitians are the only health professionals with the training (bachelors and/or masters degree) and knowledge (spending over 1200 hours of supervised practice prior to licensure) of how to perform individualized nutrition assessments and provide nutrition education based on evidenced based practice standards. Registered Dietitians are also held to a high standard of ongoing education and training in order to maintain our licensure and stay up to date with nutrition guidelines. Other health professionals can, and often do, provide general nutrition guidance based on the dietary guidelines for Americans or MyPlate. Allowing unlicensed and unregulated individuals access to providing nutrition education and assessments leaves our citizens at risk for getting uninformed and possibly medically inappropriate recommendations, and should be left to licensed professionals (Registered Dietitians).Please reject this bill and maintain the integrity of nutrition professionals and practice to those with the education and training.

As your constituent, a registered dietitian nutritionist (RDN), and a member of Missouri Academy of Nutrition and Dietetics, I strongly oppose the changes proposed in HB 475 relating to the Licensure of Dietitians.Missouri's Dietitian Practice Act (Chapter 324.200-324.225 RSMo) was enacted in 1998 to ensure proper education standards needed to provide specific nutrition services to the public. The proposed exemption in HB 475 would completely undermine our profession. It would also affect Missourians decision making who are looking treat or manage diseases and other medical conditions with the specific training and education that is necessary to do so. The current Dietitian Practice Act is working as intended, it does not prevent those who wish to talk to clients about healthy eating and nutrition. Unless unlicensed individuals are seeking to provide individualized counseling to treat or manage patients and clients with diseases or medical conditions, they will continue to be exempt from the current licensing law.Despite these facts (and our national organization's ongoing efforts to collaborate with proponents to clarify misunderstandings of the law here in Missouri and elsewhere), HB 475 is a dangerous solution in search of a merely hypothetical problem; it would newly allow anyone without any training or background to provide complex medical nutrition therapies to patients with nutrition-related diseases and medical conditions. As a licensed RDN, we go through rigorous education, internships and medical training to gain experience needed for the services we provide. You simply cannot acquire the training and experience needed without going through the process of becoming an licensed RDN. I urge you to oppose HB 475 to avoid grave unintended consequences of eliminating these critical, effective, consumer protections.WITNESS APPEARANCE FORMMISSOURI HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES HB 475BILL NUMBER: DATE: 2/24/2021 COMMITTEE: Professional Registration and Licensing FOR INFORMATIONAL PURPOSES IN OPPOSITION TO IN SUPPORT OF TESTIFYING: WITNESS NAME INDIVIDUAL: THIS FORM IS PUBLIC RECORD UNDER CHAPTER 610, RSMo. My name is Ashlee Zeiler. I am a Registered Dietitian, licensed here in my home state of Missouri. I earned my Bachelor of Science in Nutrition and Dietetics at Northwest Missouri State University, followed by a coordinated internship and Master's degree program at the University of Kansas Medical Center. Following these degrees and 1200-hour internship, I sat for my dietitian exam and became a registered dietitian in January of 2009. I complete at least 75 hours of continuing education every five years to maintain my license and registration. In the last twelve years as a dietitian, I've worked in several practice areas, including nutrition support in the intensive care unit, in pediatric oncology, in eating disorders, in outpatient weight management, in dialysis clinics, in diabetes education centers, and in long-term care. In all of these settings, I've used a process that dietitians refer to as the Nutrition Care Process, with steps called A.D.I.M.E. The \"A\" in A.D.I.M.E. stands for our Assessment. It comes first due to its importance. Everything that follows\u2014diagnosis, intervention, monitoring, and evaluation, is based off the assessment. We use this assessment along with evidence-based guidelines to provide safe, personalized nutrition care plans for our patients and clients. Our education and training entrust us to understand clinical connections between laboratory results, medical histories, physical-focused exams, allergies, anthropometrics, potential drug-nutrient interactions, and so on to develop interventions that will be safe, effective, and in collaboration with the person's holistic plan of care across their providers. We document this assessment and plan in the electronic medical record for other providers to reference. The language included in House Bill No. 475 proposes to allow \"any person\" to provide this individualized nutrition assessment and guidance. This is simply not safe for Missourians. I implore this committee to consider the potential harm that can be done to our citizens if they are led to believe any person claiming an interest or expertise in nutrition can safely guide decisions that can impact a person's blood glucose control, kidney function, allergic reactions, etc. The list of chronic conditions that could be mismanaged is extensive. Dietitians are one of the first lines of defense in the rising prevalence of chronic conditions and their related healthcare costs. Missouri cannot afford--in our lives, well-being, or pocket books--to not reinforce the need for individualized assessment and medical nutrition therapy to be performed solely by licensed, registered dietitians. Missouri has more than 2300 registered dietitians that in the last year have become adept at reaching rural communities and leveraging technology in order to continue to serve our communities. We have a public tool to locate dietitians by zip code and most health plans can also provide contact lists and/or online look-up tools. Accessibility and affordability are improving, with many dietitians serving in community roles.I have respect for health coaches, once holding a health coach certification myself, and I encourage them to continue to provide general nutrition information\u2014information that our dietetics profession makes freely available for that shared public interest. I reviewed what it would take for someone to become board certified by the National Board for Health and Wellness Coaching. It requires you go through one of their training programs, complete 50 hours of coaching sessions, andpass their exam. In the list of extremely variable training programs, I found several that I could complete in a few months. One consisted of just six classes, primarily focused on organic gardening, botany, and medicinal herbs. Upon reviewing the content outline of their exam, there was a very small section related to nutrition that stated coaches should be familiar with \"the basics of a healthy diet\" and then references general education sources, such as ChooseMyPlate.gov. There is clearly no standard for mastering any concepts of clinical nutrition. If these types of certifications are what proponents are stating makes them qualified for performing \"individualized nutrition assessment, guidance, encouragement, recommendations, or weight control services,\" then that shows a clear lack of understanding for the depth of clinical knowledge to perform these safely and successfully. Furthermore, the proposed new language doesn't set a standard for any type of training or certification; it merely states \"any person.\"In conclusion, I ask this committee, to respect and uphold dietitians' scope of practice, understanding there is a significant difference between general information and individualized assessment and guidance. We do not need to remove the parameters that have kept Missourians safe for more twenty years.WITNESS APPEARANCE HB 475BILL NUMBER: DATE: 2/24/2021 COMMITTEE: Professional Registration and Licensing FOR INFORMATIONAL PURPOSES IN OPPOSITION TO IN SUPPORT OF TESTIFYING: WITNESS INFORMATION ON THIS FORM IS PUBLIC RECORD UNDER CHAPTER 610, RSMo. Licensure for Registered Dietitian Nutritionists (RDN) ensures that providers have the competencies and training necessary to provide patients with accurate and empirically based nutrition-related disease management and care. As a Diabetes Educator and RDN, I have seen first-hand how nutrition related misinformation puts many patients at risk. If licensure laws were relaxed, patients who already are inundated with misinformation through the media and online would be exposed to possible misinformation through individuals with insufficient training taking on the role of healthcare providers.

The Missouri Dietitian Practice Act is important in keeping the public safe from misinformation fromunqualified nutrition professionals seeking to treat clients with medical conditions/diseases. I believe that there needs to be certain education standards to be able to provide this type of education to clients, and this act helps protect our communities from receiving false information. As a career dietitian, I already struggle with trying to set straight misinformation from the internet alone.

My name is Barbara Ransom and I am asking that you vote no to HB 475. I am currently a dietetic intern on the path to becoming a registered dietitian. In addition to earning a Bachelor of Science in nutrition, I am completing a required 1200-hour internship under the supervision of experienced clinicians. In this rigorous internship, I am learning to assess the nutritional status of patients with complex medical histories. This includes reviewing medical diagnoses, obtaining diet histories, identifying potential drug-nutrient interactions from medications, interpreting lab values, and performing nutrition focused physical exams to identify malnutrition and deficiencies. This bill proposes to allow \"any person\" to perform this individualized nutrition assessment. I am in my fifth year of education in this field and continue to learn every day. Allowing those without the required education and training to complete these assessments poses a great risk to the health of Missourians. I have seen many patients who have listened to unqualified nutrition advice. For example, I have seen patients following restrictive diets from the internet, claiming to make them healthier, which leads to side effects such as dangerously low blood sugars. I have seen other patients who have spent large amounts of money on supplements recommended by nutritionists that haven't been scientifically proven to work. A quick internet search will show an endless list of nutrition misinformation. It is important that Missourians are protected from nutrition information that isn't evidence-based. I ask that you oppose this bill because it allows unqualified individuals the ability to perform nutrition assessments, therefore risking the health and safety of Missourians. Thank you for your time.WITNESS APPEARANCE HB 475BILL NUMBER: DATE: 2/24/2021 COMMITTEE: Professional Registration and Licensing FOR INFORMATIONAL PURPOSES IN OPPOSITION TO IN SUPPORT OF TESTIFYING: WITNESS NAME THIS FORM IS PUBLIC RECORD UNDER CHAPTER 610, RSMo. I am writing to express my opposition to HB 475. I have been a dietitian for over 40 years and have great respect for the training dietitians receive that allows them to use evidenced based information to provide medical nutrition therapy. I consider individualized nutrition assessment and intervention to be services that are components of medical nutrition therapy which is within the scope of practice of registered, licensed dietitians only. For many years I worked with medically complex children thru the Missouri First Steps program and at Cardinal Glennon Children's Hospital. Nutrition assessment is key to providing appropriate nutrition advice for the families of these children. It should not be done by any individual who calls themself a nutritionist without the appropriate training to treat medically complex conditions. Parents of children who have developmental delays are always looking for a miracle cure. Allowing unqualified individuals to do nutrition assessments puts these families at risk of receiving inaccurate information and treatment.The Dietitian Practice Act (Chapter 324.200.225 RSMo) was enacted in 1998 to ensure that the public receives quality, evidence based nutrition advice for individual needs, health conditions and complex dietary requirements. The proposed change in the law negates the dietitian practice act and makes it possible for any person regardless of training to provide nutrition assessment and intervention. There are 6 exemptions to the current law that allows other people who do not call themselves dietitians to provide general nutrition advice and I feel these exemptions are appropriate for the services the current proponents of HB 475 would potentially provide. There have not been any issues reported to the Division of Professional Registration indicating that someone has not been able to furnish general nutrition information.Thank you for your consideration in this manner.Beth Piper, MHS, RDN, LDNMissouri Academy of Nutrition and Dietetics NUMBER: DATE: 2/24/2021 COMMITTEE: Professional Registration and Licensing FOR INFORMATIONAL PURPOSES IN OPPOSITION TO IN SUPPORT OF TESTIFYING: WITNESS NAME THIS FORM IS PUBLIC RECORD UNDER CHAPTER 610, RSMo. In order to protect the safety of the public, this bill must be opposed. Registered dietitians go through many years of upper level education through an accredited program, a 1200 hour internship, and must pass a board certified exam in order to ensure safe standards of practice. There are a high prevalence of chronic diseases in our country that could be prevented with proper nutrition, and dietitians sacrifice many years of their life and thousands of dollars in tuition and fees in order to become experts on this very topic. Compare this to the average length of time it takes to complete a nutrition certification, most of which are online and self-paced, and this should tell you all you need to know to oppose this bill. By allowing anyone to provide MNT, you are asking for non-evidence based practice to spread rampant in an industry that is already known for spreading false information and making fortunes off of \"magic pills\". Passing this bill would not only harm members of the public \u2014whether that be physically, emotionally, or financially \u2014 but it would also be a direct insult to a profession that has served the public for over a century.WITNESS APPEARANCE FORMMISSOURI HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES HB 475BILL NUMBER: DATE: 2/24/2021 COMMITTEE: Professional Registration and Licensing FOR INFORMATIONAL PURPOSES IN OPPOSITION TO IN SUPPORT OF TESTIFYING: WITNESS NAME THIS FORM IS PUBLIC RECORD UNDER CHAPTER 610, RSMo. I would like to ask the Missouri state legislature to uphold sound and well established standards in the field of nutrition and dietetics by voting in opposition to HB 475. This bill would dilute the quality of nutritional care in our communities by allowing unqualified individuals to make critical nutritional health recommendations to the public. It's important that healthcare in Missouri maintain the high quality standards that we as Americans and Missourians deserve and expect. I am a citizen that at one time looked to \"nutritionists\" and even Chiropractors for nutrition advice. I later learned that there is a level of education that these professionals do not go through around food science and human nutrition. A Registered Dietitian however does go through the proper training and education in order to provide the level of expertise required to make critical decisions regarding what a patient should or should not eat based on their unique circumstances. I am grateful that our healthcare system has these qualifications well defined, and that a clear path towards education and certification for this profession already exists. We have a way for Missourians to receive safe, specialized, and excellent nutritional care in our state from our existing Dietetics professionals who have completed the required education programs to become a Registered Dietician.

Members of the House Professional Registration and Licensing CommitteeDear Representative:We are writing to you regarding House Bill 475 introduced by Representative Grier. HB 475 would allow any person to \"provide individualized nutrition assessment to treat any type of medical condition\". The implications of allowing those without a license and without the proper education to do nutritional assessments would be detrimental to public health.As you know, a licensure act defines a scope of practice and providing nutrition assessment is part of the definition of \"Dietetics Practice\".Dietitians have a minimum of a baccalaureate degree; have completed academic requirements of a didactic program in dietetics; successfully completed the registration examination for dietitians; and accrue seventy-five hours of approved continuing professional units every five years. Dietitians and other qualified healthcare professionals are specifically trained to do nutritional assessments.There are 6 exemptions in the current law that allow individual professionals to talk with their clients about food, diet and nutrition, as long as the person involved does not hold himself or herself out as a dietitian. Exemptions 5 and 6 are referenced below: 324.206 (5) Individuals who do not hold themselves out as dietitians marketing or distributing food products including dietary supplements as defined by the Food and Drug Administration or engaging in the explanation and education of customers regarding the use of such products. 324.206(6) Any person furnishing general nutrition information as to the use of food, food materials, or dietary supplements, nor prevent in any way the free dissemination of literature; provided, however, no such individual may call himself for herself a dietitian unless he or she is licensed under this chapter.Thank you for your time and consideration.

As a registered dietitian, a member of Missouri Academy of Nutrition and Dietetics, and a public health professional, I strongly oppose the changes proposed in HB 475 relating to the Licensure of Dietitians.I am currently employed at Operation Food Search, a food bank in St. Louis, where I have seen first hand the detrimental effects of an unlicensed health coach or holistic educator on the health of our community. Dietitians provide specialized, science-based medical nutrition therapy related to serious conditions such as kidney disease, gastrointestinal disease, cancer, HIV, AIDS, diabetes, heart disease and many more. Misinformation about these conditions can cause great harm.Nearly anyone can call themselves a nutritionist and ''prove it'' with official-looking certificates, but these are often very deceiving as they come from an online program that can generally be earned in only a few months. On the other hand, registered dietitians are food and nutrition experts who have met the following criteria to earn the RDN credential: Completed a minimum of a bachelor's degree at a US regionally accredited university or college, completed supervised practice, passed a national examination, and complete yearly continuing education to maintain credentials. This is NOT an online certificate program! Licensure of RDNs protects consumers from harmful, ineffective and fraudulent services provided by potentially unqualified or incompetent practitioners. It is important to note that licensure does not prevent an individual from seeking advice from anyone they choose; it prevents unqualified individuals from providing nutrition-related medical services to the public and enables consumers to identify the practitioners with the necessary education, experience and competencies to provide safe and effective services. Patients and consumers should expect those who offer medical nutrition therapy are qualified to do so.To be clear, the current law does not prevent anyone from \"talk[ing] with individual clients about healthy eating and nutrition\" and unless unlicensed individuals are seeking to provide individualized counseling to treat or manage patients and clients with diseases or medical conditions, they will continue to be exempt from the current licensing law. To underscore this fact, the Division of Professional Registration - State Committee of Dietitians reports that there have been no complaints about someone providing the nutrition information or advice proponents assert they are unable to provide and thus the Committee has had no reason to discipline or sanction these unlicensed providers. In short, the Dietitian Practice Act is working as intended. Despite these facts (and our national organization's ongoing efforts to collaborate with proponents to clarify misunderstandings of the law here in Missouri and elsewhere), HB 475 offers a dangerously disproportionate solution in search of a merely hypothetical problem; it would newly allow anyone without any training or background to provide complex medical nutrition therapies to patients with nutrition-related diseases and medical conditions. I urge you to oppose HB 475 to avoid grave unintended consequences of eliminating these critical, effective, and narrowly tailored consumer protections.WITNESS APPEARANCE FORMMISSOURI HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES HB 475BILL NUMBER: DATE: 2/24/2021 COMMITTEE: Professional Registration and Licensing FOR INFORMATIONAL PURPOSES IN OPPOSITION TO IN SUPPORT OF TESTIFYING: WITNESS NAME THIS FORM IS PUBLIC RECORD UNDER CHAPTER 610, RSMo.

Oppose HB 475/SB 232 Message: As your constituent, a registered dietitian nutritionist, I strongly oppose the changes proposed in HB 475 relating to the Licensure of Dietitians. Missouri's Dietitian Practice Act (Chapter 324.200-324.225 RSMo) was enacted in 1998 to protect the public from demonstrated harm and to recognize the education standards needed to provide vital health care services to the public and it has worked effectively for more than twenty years. The proposed exemption in HB 475 would swallow the rule, eliminating key protections for Missourians seeking to treat or manage diseases and other medical conditions. To be clear, the current law does not prevent anyone from \"talk[ing] with individual clients about healthy eating and nutrition\" and unless unlicensed individuals are seeking to provide individualized counseling to treat or manage patients and clients with diseases or medical conditions, they will continue to be exempt from the current licensing law. To underscore this fact, the Division of Professional Registration - State Committee of Dietitians reports that there have been no complaints about someone providing the nutrition information or advice proponents assert they are unable to provide and thus the Committee has had no reason to discipline or sanction these unlicensed providers. In short, the Dietitian Practice Act is working as intended. Despite these facts (and our national organization's ongoing efforts to collaborate with proponents to clarify misunderstandings of the law here in Missouri and elsewhere), HB 475 offers a dangerously disproportionate solution in search of a merely hypothetical problem; it would newly allow anyone without any training or background to provide complex medical nutrition therapies to patients with nutrition-related diseases and medical conditions. I urge you to oppose HB 475 to avoid grave unintended consequences of eliminating these critical, effective, and narrowly tailored consumer protections.Thank you,Carrie WeatherholtWITNESS 2/24/2021 COMMITTEE: Professional Registration and Licensing FOR INFORMATIONAL PURPOSES IN OPPOSITION TO IN SUPPORT OF TESTIFYING: WITNESS THIS FORM IS PUBLIC RECORD UNDER CHAPTER 610, RSMo.

Good afternoon, Missouri House Committee on Professional Registration. I am in opposition of HB475. As a Registered Dietitian in Jefferson County and a Member of the Academy of Nutrition and Dietetics, I am writing with serious concerns about HB475. I completed the Dietetic Internship and pursed a Master's degree in human nutrition because I have a passion for providing nutrition education, increasing awareness of sustainability, and reducing food insecurity within my community. The advanced education I have completed is necessary to safely and responsibly provide the medical services a Registered Dietitian is licensed to do. Licensed Registered Dietitians are equipped with intensive education rooted in the natural and organic sciences to provide understanding of how the body works, and how food and disease impact the body and its processes. The information Registered Dietitians provide to the public is evidence-based to prevent any harm or wrongdoing. With the current licensure requirements and laws, health coaches and unlicensed nutrition practitioners can provide general nutrition information. They do not have 5-6 years of education or the 1200 hours of clinical experience with supervision required during Dietetic Internship programs, both of which qualify Registered Dietitians to complete comprehensive nutrition assessments and provide Medical Nutrition Therapy. In addition to the education required to obtain licensure, Registered Dietitians must complete Continuing Education hours to maintain licensure. Science is ever changing and this profession needs to be committed to life-long learning.Repealing the licensure required to provide Medical Nutrition Therapy would be dangerous and irresponsible. If individuals wish to practice Medical Nutrition Therapy to benefit public health, they should be required to complete the same education and should be held to the same standards as Registered Dietitians. I strongly encourage you to oppose HB475 to act in the best interest of Missouri residents.WITNESS APPEARANCE FORMMISSOURI HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES HB 475BILL NUMBER: DATE: 2/24/2021 COMMITTEE: Professional Registration and Licensing FOR INFORMATIONAL PURPOSES IN OPPOSITION TO IN SUPPORT OF TESTIFYING: WITNESS THIS FORM IS PUBLIC RECORD UNDER CHAPTER 610, RSMo.

I am writing, as Registered Dietitian, in OPPOSITION to HB475. I have many concerns of this bill passing. Those in favor of this bill have a clear misunderstanding of the Scope of Practice handed to non-RD professionals via the Dietetics Practice Act. Those who receive a \"nutrition certification\" have the ability to provide GENERAL nutrition information to the general public, based on the national Dietary Guidelines. What they DO NOT have the ability to do is provide in-depth nutrition assessments and MEDICAL Nutrition Therapy, nor should they. Registered Dietitians like myself have completed at minimum 5-6 YEARS of formal education and training, prior to passing a Board Certified Exam. In comparison, non-RD health coaches and/or other non-RD nutrition certification recipients complete only months of computer based training. These individuals have not completed courses such as biochemistry, organic chemistry, medical nutrition therapy, etc that are necessary to provide safe and effective nutrition counseling to individuals who have medical conditions. Non-RD nutrition \"specialists\" currently have the ability to ask general nutrition related questions and provide GENERAL nutrition advice. This is appropriate considering that they are not trained and/or educated in anything further. I ask that you, as leaders of our state, protect the citizens you are representing and assure that when needed and desired, they are given EVIDENCE-BASED nutrition therapy from a Licensed Registered Dietitian, a nutrition EXPERT and a credible Health Care Professional. I will leave you with this, if diagnosed with a serious medical condition, would you like to receive medical advice from a someone who has completed a few months worth of online courses or from a doctor who is made to complete years of training and pass comprehensive exams verifying he/she has the knowledge and experience to treat you safely?

I have the perfect real life example why I am opposed to changes to the RD licensure law. I am a dieittian and diabetes educator at Washington Univeristy in Saint Louis. Two years ago I had patient who we had been working hard with to control his diabetes. After his kidney transplant his blood sugars were again to high and he needed to get them down to protect the new kidney. We and he was successful in improving his Hgb A1c from 11.7 to 7.2 with diet and exericse changes and ongoing adjustments to his insulin plan. We then went almost a year without hearing from him until he showed up on my schedule and came back in. I was shocked to see his A1c was back up to 13.3%. His diabetes was completely out of control once again and he had had a stroke and had limited use of one arm. He said a chiropractor told him if he followed the diet he had for him he could get off of his diabetes medicine. So he stopped taking his insulin and followed the so called diet of someone he thought he could trust and it completely back fired on him. He ended up with a stroke from out of control blood sugars. There is no diet that would miraculously allow him to stop taking his insulin. It should be illegal for someone to give diet advice which is not based on scientific evidence. The proposed changes would eliminate protections for the health and wellbeing of the public by letting unqualified practitioners provide nutrition assessments to patients with nutrition-related diseases and medical conditions, thereby undermining the current licensure law.

As a registered dietitian I wanted to clarify that the individuals who are concerned that the current practice act for registered dietitians limits some activities and thus needs to be changed through HB475 may have missed this part of the practice act. The current act says - \" 324.206. Permitted acts by persons not holding themselves out as dietitians. \u2014 As long as the person involved does not represent or hold himself or herself out as a dietitian as defined by subdivision (4) of subsection 2 of section 324.200, nothing in sections 324.200 to 324.225 is intended to limit, preclude, or otherwise interfere with:(5) Individuals who do not hold themselves out as dietitians marketing or distributing food products including dietary supplements as defined by the Food and Drug Administration or engaging in the explanation and education of customers regarding the use of such products; (6) Any person furnishing general nutrition information as to the use of food, food materials, or dietary supplements, nor prevent in any way the free dissemination of literature; provided, however, no such individual may call himself or herself a dietitian unless he or she is licensed under this chapter.\"Connie Diekman, M.Ed., RD, CSSD, LD, FADA, FANDFood and Nutrition ConsultantFormer President of the Academy of Nutrition and DieteticsMember of the Missouri State Committee of DietitiansWITNESS APPEARANCE OF REPRESENTATIVES HB 475BILL NUMBER: DATE: 2/24/2021 COMMITTEE: Professional Registration and Licensing FOR INFORMATIONAL PURPOSES IN OPPOSITION TO IN SUPPORT OF TESTIFYING: WITNESS NAME THIS FORM IS PUBLIC RECORD UNDER CHAPTER 610, RSMo. Missouri House Committee on Professional RegistrationGood Afternoon. I am a Registered Dietitian in St Louis and a Former President of the Academy of Nutrition and Dietetics. I am writing with deep concerns about HB475 which I understand is scheduled to be heard on Wednesday, February 17.HB475 has the potential of having a negative impact on the health of Missourians. As a Registered Dietitian (RD), my education was strongly rooted in the sciences including anatomy and physiology, chemistry, biology, microbiology, food science, along with courses in nutrition, advanced nutrition and other courses that provide me with a good understanding of how the body works. This education ensures that when I do a nutrition assessment of a client, I understand how blood levels impact nutrition, I know what it means to ensure that a diet is balanced to maximize overall health. In addition to learning about the physiological needs of the body I also learned about behavior change and how to help clients make changes that are sometimes challenging. This understanding of behavior change also ensures that I can recognize when a client might have a fear of diets or a fear of weight causing me to shift my recommendation to avoid triggering disordered eating. In addition to my education, I have a Standard of Practice upon which my credential is based and reviewed. I must adhere to our Code of Ethics to maintain my credential. Nutrition assessment is much more than simply hearing a client's goals, food likes and dislikes, and making recommendations. Nutrition assessment is defined not only in the Scope of Practice for the current licensure bill, but it is defined in our Nutrition Care Process. Nutrition assessment involves assessing three components that provide information on a clients/patient's health. The first parameter is looking at a patient's anthropometric measures - height, weight, body fat % and other measurements. The second parameter is assessing blood values to determine nutritional status - is a patient malnourished or are their nutrient levels out of balance indicating either disease or malnutrition. And the third component is assessing current conditions related to food intake - social, economic, mobility, etc. These components are essential to determining the true nutritional needs of individuals and the skill of conducting a thorough nutrition assessment is something clearly defined in the Standard of Practice for Registered Dietitians.As you review this bill, I would ask that you think about the impact of this proposed change on the health of Missourians if the ability to provide nutrition assessment is extended to those who do not have the depth of training of RD's. Having worked with Certified Athletic Trainers (ATC) while I worked at Washington University and when I worked for the St Louis Rams, I know that they do not have the depth of training that RD's have and they respect our role in helping our athletes. We are collaborators in helping our athletes be the best they can be, and ATC's have no desire to do nutrition assessment, they are there to support what we recommend. The same holds true for audiologists, speech therapists and - in many cases our MD colleagues. Our medical colleagues know the value and importance of the RD credential and scope of practice. Please do not compromise that credential or the health of Missourians! HB475 is not a bill for the health of Missouri!Thank you for your time, your work on our behalf and Stay Well!ConnieDiekman, M.Ed., RD, CSSD, LD, FADA, FANDFood NUMBER: DATE: 2/24/2021 COMMITTEE: Professional Registration and Licensing FOR INFORMATIONAL PURPOSES IN OPPOSITION TO IN SUPPORT OF TESTIFYING: WITNESS NAME THIS FORM IS PUBLIC RECORD UNDER CHAPTER 610, RSMo.

As a current dietetic intern and member of the Missouri Academy of Nutrition and Dietetics, I strongly oppose the changes proposed in HB 475, and urge you to do so as well. Registered dietitians must complete an accredited bachelor's degree, complete 1,000+ hours of supervised practice, obtain a master's degree, and pass a national examination to receive their credentials. In addition, registered dietitians must complete continuous education to maintain their credentials. The education that a registered dietitian receives to safely and effectively conduct nutrition assessments is incomparable to the limited education health or nutrition coaches receive in online certificate programs. Just as you would not want someone with a basic first aid certification acting as a registered nurse, you do not want a health or nutrition coach conducting nutrition assessments. Registered dietitians are the nutrition experts. They use evidenced-based practice to help constituents in need of medical nutrition therapy. It is unsafe and reckless to enable someone without proper training to provide this form of healthcare. Therefore, I once again urge you to oppose the changes proposed in HB 475 for the safety and good of the people.WITNESS APPEARANCE FORMMISSOURI HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES HB 475BILL NUMBER: DATE: 2/24/2021 COMMITTEE: Professional Registration and Licensing FOR INFORMATIONAL PURPOSES IN OPPOSITION TO IN SUPPORT OF TESTIFYING: WITNESS NAME THIS FORM IS PUBLIC RECORD UNDER CHAPTER 610, RSMo. As a registered dietitian, I went through a 4 year bachelors degree with many credit hours in medical nutrition therapy in addition to over 1000 hours of supervised practice in medical nutrition therapy to become a dietitian. A \"nutritionist\" or \"health coach\" can obtain their \"title\" by completing online courses totaling 24 hours and these are not regulated titles. This bill would allow these individuals to provide nutrition recommendations to patients/clients that could be harmful.My education provided me knowledge that allows me to focus on evidence-based recommendations and to take all of a client/patients comorbidities into account when making nutrition recommendations.You may think, what is the harm if someone just wants to lose weight? A nutritionist or health coach may not know to even find out what comorbidities a client/patient has. What if the patient has diabetes or kidney disease? This SHOULD change their recommendations, but will it? If a patient comes to a provider for weight loss, often they recommend a high protein diet with plenty of vegetables. However, what if this patient has kidney disease? Putting this patient on a high protein diet would cause much more harm than good. It could even cause the patient to end up on dialysis and have permanent kidney damage. What if a health coach or nutritionist recommends supplements or vitamins to this patient without taking into consideration their kidney function? This patient could obtain toxic levels of nutrients because their kidneys are not functioning properly. This is just one example, of many where this bill could cause more harm than good. I highly recommend opposing HB 475 for the health and safety of Missourians.WITNESS APPEARANCE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES HB 475BILL NUMBER: DATE: 2/24/2021 COMMITTEE: Professional Registration and Licensing FOR INFORMATIONAL PURPOSES IN OPPOSITION TO IN SUPPORT OF TESTIFYING: WITNESS NAME THIS FORM IS PUBLIC RECORD UNDER CHAPTER 610, RSMo.

I am writing in hopes that you do not pass HB 475 and know how greatly this could impact those in Missouri. I feel that making it to where those with minimal education can then provide nutrition education is a huge set back to keeping those in our state healthy and receiving legitimate information. To become a Registered Dietitian it takes a lot of work and in the end results in taking an exam to have these credentials behind our names. To me this would be no different than allowing people to practice as nurses without being credentialed as a Registered Nurse. This should be seen as no different. I would not feel safe having someone treat me as a nurse without going through extensive clinicals and exams before being able to do so. This should be viewed the same for Registered Dietitians. To become a Registered Dietitian we complete our internship and then sit for an exam. We have a lot of Registered Dietitians in the state of Missouri that do an exceedingly good job at providing up to date information and staying on top of the always changing diseases and changes in diets, etc. If we discredit those that have worked hard for a title that individuals know that can trust, then why wouldn't we discredit other credentials people have worked just as hard for. I really hope you can see the big picture and know that Registered Dietitians put in a lot of hours and time to become professionals for those that truly are in need and it would be a huge set back to the health of those in our state if you allow others to treat them as if they have the same education.

Dear members of the committee, I am currently working towards my second bachelors in nutrition and dietetics. The reason I decided to go back to school was to develop myself through extensive nutrition education so I could practice as a nutrition professional confident in my abilities (as developed through a 1200hr internship) and knowledge (as developed through a BS in nutrition and dietetics). I want to follow this path so as to decrease the chances I can harm someone through unsound or not scientifically proven nutritional advice. Allowing people to practice nutrition without the proper education or credentials is like taking your car to a house to be worked on just because the person hung up a sign saying \"mechanic.\" Or it is like going to get your teeth worked on by someone who never went to dental school. These policies of credentialed professionals were in place for a reason and that was to protect not only the practitioners but also the public. By opposing this bill, you members of the committee are also helping to protect the public from potentially harmful information that can come from people who are practicing nutrition without possessing the proper credentials or education. Thank you for taking time to read my comments and please take the next step in doing the right thing and protect Missourians and their nutritional health.WITNESS APPEARANCE 475BILL NUMBER: DATE: 2/24/2021 COMMITTEE: Professional Registration and Licensing FOR INFORMATIONAL PURPOSES IN OPPOSITION TO IN SUPPORT OF TESTIFYING: WITNESS NAME THIS FORM IS PUBLIC RECORD UNDER CHAPTER 610, RSMo.

I am in opposition of HB 475 because it could present a danger to public safety. The registered dietitians are licensed to protect the public from individuals that claim to be experts in nutrition but only have on line degrees of 6-9 months. Dietitians are like all other medical professionals, we have 5 - 6 years of training and expertise before being registered in the field. I have been in the field over 40 years and have had to fight this battle over and over again. Everyone thinks they are experts in nutrition and see an opportunity to make money with it. The way the current license is stated these individuals can provide general information what they can not do is complete nutrition assessments which is a part of Medical Nutrition Therapy that is provided by the licensed and registered dietitians.I manage 23 licensed and registered dietitians. Numerous stories from clients and patients who have received the wrong information. Oncology patients that starve themselves because they don't want to feed the cancer. Individuals that take all types of supplements not knowing how they interact with their medications disease states. Patients that have spent lots of their hard earned money to try an unsustainable program or nutrition supplement only to fail later. Registered dietitians use evidence based nutrition in their nutrition assessments and their care plans. The individualize patient care. It is dangerous to allow these \"so called Certified nutritionists \" to provide nutritional assessments. Just like you would not want a nurse practitioner doing heart surgery. You don't want a \"so called \"certified nutritionist\" doing medical nutrition therapy(nutrition assessments).

I felt compelled to write again to vehemently oppose HR 475 to modify the Dietitian License. After reviewing more about why these individuals and or organizations what to amend this license in Missouri it is all that more important that you vote NO on this bill. Just because many of them have received some nutrition education that does not qualify them to do nutrition assessments. An individual can take a lot of law classes and not pass the bar. Would you let him practice as a lawyer, he still has all of the education? The sole reason for licensed dietitians is to protect the public. It is not a monopoly on the nutrition business. The current license as it reads allows individuals to provide nutrition information, share recipes, cooking skills, wellness coaching, etc. The license is there to prevent individuals (nutrition/wellness coaches ) from doing nutrition assessments. They are welcome to work with patients to better their health. But many want to prescribe supplements, take away foods, etc. sell products. There is a wealth of myths and misinformation out there for the whole public to be prey to. Dietitians are trained and use evidence based research and education to make sure the public gets the \"right\" information. Dietitians are not in this field to make money. They are in it to help people with their nutrition needs and to keep them safe. Many of the people in support of this bill are doing so as a business and to make money off of the consumer. Selling products that they may not need. Some have voiced a concern that dietitians are not readily available to the rural or smaller communities. This has changed. CMS has lifted restrictions for the use of Telehealth for dietitians to provide online counseling anywhere in the state of Missouri and can even do so in neighboring states. Telehealth has provided the needed platform for the Dietitians to provide the continuity of care once a patients is discharged from the hospital and continue their nutrition support. Telehealth (virtual counseling) now provides the avenue for the dietitians to work with the patient in their home setting without the patient having to travel long distances. So dietitians are readily accessible for all Missourians. Weight Watchers have never challenged the license and they are in the nutrition business. They provide lots of nutrition information, but they do not do nutrition assessments. There is absolutely no need to modify the RD license as it stands now. It is general enough for individuals to provide healthy nutrition information. Dietitians are not regulated on what they can educate on or limited in their ability to provide the necessary nutrition education and counseling. They work directly with physicians, physical therapists, and other licensed professionals to provide the optimum care to each patient they touch. Please vote NO on this bill. The safety of the people you represent is at stake.WITNESS APPEARANCE FORMMISSOURI HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES HB 475BILL NUMBER: DATE: 2/24/2021 COMMITTEE: Professional Registration and Licensing FOR INFORMATIONAL PURPOSES IN OPPOSITION TO IN SUPPORT OF TESTIFYING: WITNESS NAME INDIVIDUAL: THIS FORM IS PUBLIC RECORD UNDER CHAPTER 610, RSMo. I am a registered dietitian nutritionist who has been a certified health coach in the past. There is a credentialing definition for a dietitian. There is no credentialing required at all to call oneself a nutritionist. A health coach may have no, some, or a substantial amount of nutrition education. In my 6 month certificate program to become a health coach, I was not required to learn any nutrition. RDNs have been trained in nationally accredited programs to assess and diagnose macro and micronutrient deficiencies. RDNs are also the only profession trained to perform medical nutrition therapy. I would like to encourage the State of Missouri to continue supporting the standards required to perform nutrition assessments and medical nutrition therapy for the health and well being of Missouri residents. Thank you for your time and attention.WITNESS APPEARANCE FORMMISSOURI HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES HB 475BILL NUMBER: DATE: 2/24/2021 COMMITTEE: Professional Registration and Licensing FOR INFORMATIONAL PURPOSES IN OPPOSITION TO IN SUPPORT OF TESTIFYING: WITNESS NAME THIS FORM IS PUBLIC RECORD UNDER CHAPTER 610, RSMo. I want to express to the Missouri House of Representatives on the importance of opposing House Bill 475. This bill puts the public in harm's way as it would allow ANYONE to give nutrition assessment and guidance. Licensed Registered Dietitians are currently the only nutrition professionals allowed to perform individualized nutrition therapy and it needs to remain that way.WITNESS APPEARANCE FORMMISSOURI HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES HB 475BILL NUMBER: DATE: 2/24/2021 COMMITTEE: Professional Registration and Licensing FOR INFORMATIONAL PURPOSES IN OPPOSITION TO IN SUPPORT OF TESTIFYING: WITNESS NAME INDIVIDUAL: THIS FORM IS PUBLIC RECORD UNDER CHAPTER 610, RSMo. I respectfully request that you oppose HB475. As a Registered and Licensed Dietitian Nutritionist, it is imperative for the safety and wellbeing of our communities that those allowed to provide assessments and Medical Nutrition Therapy have received the in depth science based college education required for registry and licensure. The five to six years of science, anatomy and physiology, nutrition and behavioral therapy courses provided the knowledge of the body, the blood, nutrients and their functions and reactions in the body as well as the counseling and coaching skills to provide constituents appropriate and life changing guidance. I have worked for greater than 15 years in the clinical nutrition area and have witnessed patients admitted with chronic and life altering diseases that were misinformed by those less educated and providing partial or false information. My step-father was one of those. He received unfounded and incorrect information from a non-RD \"nutritionist\" at a chiropractor practice and it ultimately contributed to his fatal heart attack. My sister-in-law is experiencing non-reversible nerve dysfunction from lack of proper nutrition when she was guided by another non-RD health coach and failed to consume enough of the B vitamins. Requiring nutritional assessments to be completed and Medical Nutrition Therapy provided by Registered and licensed dietitian nutritionist is the proper and right thing based on the needed education to safely provide this care. We expect other health professionals (physicians, nurses, pharmacists, physical therapists, psychiatrists) to have the proper educational background to care for their patients, why would we expect less from nutritional professionals. Please vote in opposition to bill HB475.

Dietitians are uniquely trained to provide nutrition assessments, specifically Medical Nutrition Therapy (MNT). We undergo at least 5 years of formal education and field training to earn a Masters degree. We take standardized board exams to become certified, and complete over 1200 hours of clinical practice experiences with seasoned dietitians. Dietitians have a complex understanding of nutrition, including the detailed chemistry and biochemistry behind food and the human body. Licensed dietitians have rigorous training and are the most qualified to practice nutrition therapy. There is an abundance of misinformation about nutrition the world, and the people need to know that dietitians are the experienced, trustworthy source for information. Dietitians uphold the science by using evidence- based practices, and have the individual's best interest at heart. Please oppose HB 475 to protect the people from misinformation and ensure they continue to receive certified, quality care from registered dietitians.WITNESS APPEARANCE FORMMISSOURI HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES HB 475BILL NUMBER: DATE: 2/24/2021 COMMITTEE: Professional Registration and Licensing FOR INFORMATIONAL PURPOSES IN OPPOSITION TO IN SUPPORT OF TESTIFYING: WITNESS THIS FORM IS PUBLIC RECORD UNDER CHAPTER 610, RSMo. As a Missouri resident, a registered dietitian nutritionist, and an educator of future dietitians, I strongly oppose the changes proposed in HB 475 relating to the Licensure of Dietitians.In order to be eligible for credentialing, Registered Dietitian Nutritionist (RDN) students must complete a rigorous educational curriculum that includes human biology, organic chemistry, and biochemistry. They also learn, in detail, the pathophysiology of various disease states and their nutritional implications. At a minimum, RDN students earn a 4-year undergraduate degree which, beginning in 2024, will be upgraded to a master's degree requirement. Finally, they complete at least 1200 hours of supervised practice (internship) that involves hands-on practice in the field. Due to their extensive education, RDNs are highly trained and qualified practitioners and should be the only professionals providing medical nutrition therapy, or MNT. Our nutrition care process begins with a thorough assessment of an individual's medical, social, and dietary history which lays the groundwork for a nutrition diagnosis and an individualized plan. As you might imagine, without proper training and educational background, aspects of that plan could be missed or overlooked which could have concerning and dangerous effects on a patient's health outcome. For example, without proper educational training an individual may not be aware of how to implement the latest recommendations for cardiovascular disease, or recommend a dietary change that is not evidence based or is contradictory to their medical condition. Missouri's Dietitian Practice Act (Chapter 324.200-324.225 RSMo) was enacted in 1998 to protect the public from demonstrated harm and to recognize the education standards needed to provide vital health care services to the public and it has worked effectively for more than twenty years. The proposed exemption in HB 475 would swallow the rule, eliminating key protections for Missourians seeking to treat or manage diseases and other medical conditions. To be clear, the current law does not prevent anyone from \"talk[ing] with individual clients about healthy eating and nutrition\" and unless unlicensed individuals are seeking to provide individualized counseling to treat or manage patients and clients with diseases or medical conditions, they will continue to be exempt from the current licensing law. In conclusion, I strongly urge you to oppose the changes to HB 475 and keep Missouri's Dietitian Practice Act intact to only allow properly trained and credentialed Registered Dietitian Nutritionists to practice individualized nutrition assessment. This will assure that all Missourians receive safe and quality nutrition care for a variety of health conditions.

My name is Derek Helderman, and I am a Registered Dietitian. I am writing in opposition to HB 475. This issue has been raised numerous times. It continues to be a very bad idea. While I appreciate that licensure reform might hold some value in some scenarios, this bill crosses a dangerous line. First, you should understand that Registered Dietitians don't simply tell people what to eat and what not to eat. RD's perform nutrition focused physical exams, we interpret lab values and make nutrition recommendations based off them. We perform anthropometric measurements and use their values in the care of patients. We calculate complex nutrition needs for critically ill, parenteral fed patients. This is a very brief and partial list. In order to be Registered, RD's complete a four year undergraduate degree, then complete a supervised practice program, during which they work as entry level practitioners under the direction of experienced clinicians. Once this five year process is complete, RD's must pass a registration exam and obtain continuing education units in order to maintain registration status. As I said in my opening statement, I can appreciate some licensure reform. It should not be needlessly burdensome for a burgeoning entrepreneur to shine shoes on a street corner or to braid hair. However, this bill would fundamentally alter the rights of an integral part of the allied health care team. A quick perusal of virtually any social media platform will reveal nearly unlimited sources of nutrition misinformation and dangerous quackery. Videos on YouTube purport that consuming baking soda and molasses will cure cancer. Should someone (ostensibly someone who labels themselves a \"practitioner\") with these views be allowed, as HB 475 states, to \"provide individualized nutrition assessment, guidance, encouragement, recommendations, or weight control services as to the use of food, food materials or dietary supplements\"? Of course not. HB 475 would remove the baseline protection that exists to ensure Missouri's citizens are less likely to be harmed by untrained, unqualified, uncredentialled individuals and groups. I am certain those who hope to see this bill enacted are well intentioned. I am certain they want to help people. But this bill would fundamentally alter the rights that RDs have held and should continue to hold.WITNESS APPEARANCE FORMMISSOURI HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES HB 475BILL NUMBER: DATE: 2/24/2021 COMMITTEE: Professional Registration and Licensing FOR INFORMATIONAL PURPOSES IN OPPOSITION TO IN SUPPORT OF TESTIFYING: WITNESS NAME THIS FORM IS PUBLIC RECORD UNDER CHAPTER 610, RSMo. Hi I'm Diana Grubb and I am a Dietetic Intern working with Veteran patients in the state of Missouri. I am currently in pursuit of my Registered Dietitian (RD) credentials. This process that has taken me five years to complete and in the process, I have completed coursework in microbiology, bio and organic chemistry, anatomy and physiology, metabolism, and medical nutrition therapy. In order to become a fully licensed RD I will need to complete 1200 hours of supervised practice and pass a state-recognized RD exam. HB 475 will allow any practitioners, regardless of training, schooling, or abilities, to work with patients and Veterans with complex medical conditions. Therefore, it is imperative that HB 475 not be passed, preventing individuals without proper education and training from providing nutrition education for Missourians. Before I became a dietetic student and intern, I was accepted into a Holistic Nutrition Coach program through a nonprofit organization based out of Boulder, CO. However, when I investigated the program in more depth, I realized the true lack of foundational nutrition knowledge I would be provided and how limited in scope the role of a nutrition coach really is. What I didn't realize then, and know now, was that as dietitians we see patients with acute and chronic conditions. We provide recommendations for tube feeding, calculate micro- and macronutrients needs, coach and advise diabetes patients on insulin administration, dosage, and side effects. We also serve as experts on assessing drug nutrition interactions, diagnose malnutrition, and make recommendations for patients both pre- and post-surgery. By removing requirements for individuals to provide nutrition information to local Missourians we would be providing a disservice for our local community, especially those with more complex medical nutrition care. According to the American Diabetes Association approximately 700,000 people in Missouri, or 13.2% of the population, have diabetes. Of these, an estimated 152,000 individuals have diabetes but don't know it. With that in mind, let me run you through a potential scenario. An adult male, currently undiagnosed with diabetes, see a chiropractor. The chiropractor tells this patient to follow a ketogenic diet for weight loss, limiting his carbohydrate intake to 15 to 25 grams per day. Being undiagnosed with diabetes and struggling to lose weight, this individual takes the chiropractor's advice and adopts a ketogenic diet. Two days later, this individual is admitted to the hospital for ketoacidosis, a serious health condition that can happen in people with undiagnosed diabetes when the body is breaking down too much fat. Had this individual seen an RD, who is well-trained in identifying signs/symptoms and risk factors for diabetes, it is highly unlikely they would have ended up in the hospital. By allowing individuals without proper education and training in the nutrition care process to give nutrition advice we are putting our Missouri citizens at risk for serious health conditions. Please vote no on HB 475.WITNESS APPEARANCE 2/24/2021 COMMITTEE: Professional Registration and Licensing FOR INFORMATIONAL PURPOSES IN OPPOSITION TO IN SUPPORT OF TESTIFYING: WITNESS NAME THIS FORM IS PUBLIC RECORD UNDER CHAPTER 610, RSMo. Some individuals feel one can determine malnutrition by merely looking at a person, that is not true. Just as in the diagnosis of other health condition a physical examination, laboratory data, and dietary history are needed. This data needs to be interpreted by a competent individual with a scientific background. Then an individualized plan of care is developed for the client. The registered/ licensed dietitian is uniquely trained for this task. Registered Dietitians (RD) must have at least a bachelors degree and an internship in addition to passing a national registration exam. In order to main RD status , continuing education is also required. I am also considered a wellness coach, I gained that title by an internet course on 4 Saturday mornings.WITNESS APPEARANCE FORMMISSOURI HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES HB 475BILL NUMBER: DATE: 2/24/2021 COMMITTEE: Professional Registration and Licensing FOR INFORMATIONAL PURPOSES IN OPPOSITION TO IN SUPPORT OF TESTIFYING: WITNESS NAME THIS FORM IS PUBLIC RECORD UNDER CHAPTER 610, RSMo. I write in strong in opposition of HB 475. As a current graduate student and dietetic intern, I will soon be eligible to sit for the registration examination for dietitians. In case it is not already clear what is required to sit for the exam:1. 4-year Bachelor of Science Degree in Nutrition/Dietetics2. Master's Degree (required starting in 2024, many already have it or are pursuing it) 3. 1200 clinical hours completed under RD's specialized in hospital, community, and food service settingsThese programs are intense, requiring high grades in undergraduate courses such as biochemistry, organic chemistry, medical nutrition therapy, etc. to be eligible to apply for a dietetic internship/graduate program. In the dietetic internship/graduate program you complete 1200 hours of clinical rotations while taking advanced classes in physiology, metabolism, nutrition education, and counseling, just to name a few. What the vague language in this bill creates, is a way for literally anyone to provide the same care we have been extensively trained for. It is already a battle in our profession to teach patients and clients that a \"dietitian\" is not the same thing as a \"nutritionist.\" An average person does not know the difference between a dietitian and a nutritionist. A dietitian is a nutritionist, but a nutritionist is not a dietitian. See the confusion? Therefore, this bill, which justifies itself by saying the person cannot formally call themselves a dietitian, is still a huge insult to our profession. Although harm is never the intention of those without the same training as Registered Dietitians, the reality is that even just as a student, I have already seen the harm caused by unqualified people giving nutrition advice. Assessing and recommending nutritional interventions while guiding patients/clients through that journey is the role of the Registered Dietitian. To compare . . . I do not provide Physical Therapy or Occupational Therapy related assessments or recommendations. Why should someone else be allowed to provide nutrition related assessments or recommendations? If this bill were to move on, it will just show Missourians that medical related licensure and therefore the knowledge of those who are licensed is not valued. Some may want to begin to question the licensure of others medical professionals, claiming that they know just as much. Please vote for the health and safety of our Missourians by voting against House Bill 475.

I am a certified athletic trainer (BOC-NATA certified, licensed in NY) and medical student in New York State and have long helped others navigate the plethora of \"diet advice\" out in the world. Duly educated, nationally certified, and state licensed individuals suffer the consequences of people with the equivalent of online certificates representing themselves as licensed professionals. There are too many areas of grey given the level of health literacy of the general public. The lack of regulation this would create could result in loss of human life, pseudoscience being peddled as legitimate, and the public at large receiving advice from snake oil salesmen (multilevel marketing companies, individuals without a degree or widely accepted certification, etc.).

Dear Committee Members, My name is Elise, and I am currently a dietitian with St. Louis County's WIC department. In June 2020, after five years of undergraduate schooling and an intense year-long internship, I sat for, and passed, the CDR examination to become registered dietitian. Soon afterwards I submitted my application to be licensed by the State. As a dietitian, I strongly oppose HB 475. Registered dietitians (RD) must have four years of nutrition undergraduate schooling plus an internship (generally one year in length) prior to sitting for the credentialing examination. These institutions must be accredited, and are under strict regulations, to ensure the nutrition professionals in our country are providing appropriate and evidenced-based care. If this bill is passed, we will have health coaches, \"gurus\", Instagram influencers, etc. instructing the public on inappropriate and non- evidenced based information. Many of these individuals have non-maleficent intentions, but they lack the proper education and training that RDs do. Inaccurate information given to clients by these nutrition \"professionals\" may lead to exacerbations of current health concerns or even create new ones, physical and mental. As proper nutrition is imperative to our health, over time, inappropriate instruction could lead to an increase in hospitalizations and medical costs for Missourians. Numerous studies show that unhealthy individuals (whether they suffer from physical or mental illnesses), leads to decreased productivity and financial strain for an individual and their workplace. This could eventually negatively affect productivity rates, and thus the financial state, of Missouri. If this past year has shown us anything, it is the importance of the health in our community and the affects poor health can have on our society, pandemic or sans-pandemic.Not to mention, the passing of this bill would degrade the hard work of so many current dietitians and dietetic students. I was born and raised in Missouri and it would pang me to see our legislators fail our community and our hard-working, caring, dietitians. I implore you to use your reason and truly consider the health consequences this bill may have.Sincerely,Elise Webster, RD, LDWITNESS APPEARANCE NUMBER: DATE: 2/24/2021 COMMITTEE: Professional Registration and Licensing FOR INFORMATIONAL PURPOSES IN OPPOSITION TO IN SUPPORT OF TESTIFYING: WITNESS NAME THIS FORM IS PUBLIC RECORD UNDER CHAPTER 610, RSMo.WITNESS APPEARANCE FORMMISSOURI HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES HB 475BILL NUMBER: DATE: 2/24/2021 COMMITTEE: Professional Registration and Licensing FOR INFORMATIONAL PURPOSES IN OPPOSITION TO IN SUPPORT OF TESTIFYING: WITNESS NAME INFORMATION ON THIS FORM IS PUBLIC RECORD UNDER CHAPTER 610, RSMo.

False and misleading nutrition information is promoted EVERYWHERE and the public is unable to accurately disseminate this information. I say this as a dietitian who has been practicing for 13 years; 7 of which have been in private, individualized consultation with clients. Nutrition advice provided by unlicensed nutrition \"professionals\" CAN do harm, both short- and long-term. Unlicensed professionals likely do not have the training to prevent, manage or treat nutrition-related conditions, including obesity. Even \"simple\" dietary advice, provided by the unqualified professional is damaging (ie. yo-yo dieting for weight management yields poor long-term outcomes--further obesity, which in turn promotes the development of comorbidities).

To underscore this fact, the Division of Professional Registration - State Committee of Dietitians reports that there have been?no?complaints about someone providing the nutrition information or advice proponents assert they are unable to provide. The Committee has had no reason to discipline or sanction these unlicensed providers as such.? In short, the Dietitian Practice Act is working as intended. ? Despite these facts and our national organization's ongoing efforts to collaborate with proponents to clarify misunderstandings of the law here in Missouri and elsewhere, SB 232 / HB 475 offers a dangerously disproportionate solution in search of a merely hypothetical problem; it would newly allow anyone without?any?training or background to provide complex medical nutrition therapies to patients with nutrition-related diseases and medical conditions.

My name is Eris Rolves and I am in opposition to the changes proposed in HB 475 relating to the licensure of dietitians. I am currently a student completing my required dietetic internship - 1200 hours of supervised professional practice - after obtaining a Bachelor's degree in Nutrition & Dietetics through an accredited program at Saint Louis University. I am on the brink of becoming a Registered Dietitian (RD) and I am disheartened to see this piece of legislation being considered for the third year in a row. As a future RD who intends to practice in Missouri, it is imperative to me that Missourians have access to scientifically supported nutrition care from qualified, experienced clinicians. In my time as a dietetic intern so far, I have met several patients who have been given advice that ranges from absurd to downright dangerous. One met with a \"nutritionist\" who told them they only had three years to live if they did not immediately begin eating a vegan diet. Another, who was a type 1 diabetic, was advised by a \"holistic wellness coach\" to adopt a ketogenic diet, which has the potential to be fatal towards those with this condition. Maintaining licensure for RDs in the state of Missouri means protecting its citizens from misinformation and harm. While I acknowledge that more work needs to be done to make nutrition education accessible to everyone, lowering standards of care is not the solution.WITNESS APPEARANCE FORMMISSOURI HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES HB 475BILL NUMBER: DATE: 2/24/2021 COMMITTEE: Professional Registration and Licensing FOR INFORMATIONAL PURPOSES IN OPPOSITION TO IN SUPPORT OF TESTIFYING: WITNESS NAME THIS FORM IS PUBLIC RECORD UNDER CHAPTER 610, RSMo. As a future dietitian and current dietetic intern I am in opposition to this bill. My reasoning for this is, having already spent 4 years studying nutrition at the undergraduate level, as I have been able to learn from practicing registered dietitians in a variety of settings I have realized that without the internship requiring certain learning credentials to become a registered dietitian there is much necessary information that I would have never learned or practiced. Removing the requirement of being a Registered Dietitian to offer medical nutrition therapy and nutrition assessments would put our community in a dangerous situation. Those without thorough knowledge of physiology and specific diseases/health issues would become trusted to deliver nutritional recommendations that could be detrimental. This would also cause additional confusion in the realm of nutrition as their would be \"expert\" opinions without scientific backing combating the evidence-based practice of registered dietitians.WITNESS APPEARANCE 475BILL NUMBER: DATE: 2/24/2021 COMMITTEE: Professional Registration and Licensing FOR INFORMATIONAL PURPOSES IN OPPOSITION TO IN SUPPORT OF TESTIFYING: WITNESS NAME THIS FORM IS PUBLIC RECORD UNDER CHAPTER 610, RSMo.

I have dedicated more than 7 years of education to becoming fully credentialed to provide nutrition assessment, education, and medical nutrition therapy to clients and patients. I decided that becoming fully credentialed was imperative to my ability to practice because I have seen; first hand, the damage that can be done when an individual trusts the wrong person to help guide them with these decisions. Regardless of the intent, offering nutrition services while neglecting to commit to become fully credentialed is simply irresponsible. Those in support of this ruling are currently allowed to relay general nutrition information (i.e. dietary guidelines); which is more than suitable for their client population if they are staying within their scope of practice.

Individuals who are not registered dietitians should not be allowed to provide nutrition recommendations to the public.

Food and supplements can harm people if not used appropriately. Inadequate information can lead to vitamin/mineral deficiencies and eating disorders which can both lead to death. Supplements are not regulated, so it takes a qualified RD to help the public determine which supplements are safe. This Bill can do harm to the public and should not be passes.

As a young dietitian, I see the new wave of misinformation and false credentials used in social media, businesses, etc. I specialize in eating disorders and disordered eating, when an individual's relationship with food and their body has become frustrating and negatively effecting their quality of life. Many of my clients have been given misinformation by nutritionists who call themselves \"nutrition experts.\" There are already many non-credentialed individuals giving individualized and general nutrition information and packaging it in with other services for profit. They cause damage and put individual's at risk for serious mental and physical health conditions. Beginning 2022, registered dietitians are required to have a masters degree. Until then, a bachelors degree and a 1200-hr supervised practice internship were all that was needed to earn our credentials. Given that the new wave of dietitians are to receive even more education in the field of nutrition, this makes our field more entitled to protect our licensure from others who do not share the same level of knowledge. I've seen the harm \"nutritionists\" cause the community. Please understand the value of licensure and continue to be one of the few proud states who help our career maintain it.WITNESS APPEARANCE FORMMISSOURI HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES HB 475BILL NUMBER: DATE: 2/24/2021 COMMITTEE: Professional Registration and Licensing FOR INFORMATIONAL PURPOSES IN OPPOSITION TO IN SUPPORT OF TESTIFYING: WITNESS NAME THIS FORM IS PUBLIC RECORD UNDER CHAPTER 610, RSMo.

As your constituent, a registered dietitian nutritionist(RDN), I strongly oppose the changes proposed in HB 475 relating to the Licensure of Dietitians. Our current law is intended to protect persons with complex medical nutrition-related diseases and medical conditions. I have seen firsthand the dangers that can occur when a non-RDN professionals advise persons with, for example, kidney disease. Because of the fragile functioning of their kidneys this can result in life-threatening lab imbalances. The same has occurred for clients with diabetes, who have been given advise on diets to lower blood sugar by a non-RDN who does not have the ability to decipher medications and the dangers some of those diets can pose. From what I have read and heard from those who support this is the claim they want to open up access to nutrition care. This is a claim that is not supported by reality. The current law DOES NOT prevent anyone from \"talk[ing] with individual clients about healthy eating and nutrition\" In the supporters claim, they attest that they will not diagnose or treat disease. The current law allows them to do just what they are asking to do, talk with individuals about healthy eating and nutrition.In the examples I have seen of testimonies, the supporters of HB 457 claim their access to practice is limited while at the same time they promise not to treat complex medical conditions. For one individual it was found that they are currently operating a LLC nutrition business. This practice does not appear to be under fire and may be perfectly fit for the healthy individual without medical complexities looking to lead a healthier life. I would NOT recommend it to the person with complex medical history, this is where the RDN comes in. Missouri's Dietitian Practice Act (Chapter 324.200- 324.225 RSMo) was enacted in 1998 to protect the public from demonstrated harm and to recognize the education standards needed to provide vital health care services to the public and it has worked effectively for more than twenty years. The proposed exemption in HB 475 would swallow the rule, eliminating key protections for Missourians seeking to treat or manage diseases and other medical conditions.To be clear, the current law does not prevent anyone from \"talk[ing] with individual clients about healthy eating and nutrition\" and unless unlicensed individuals are seeking to provide individualized counseling to treat or manage patients and clients with diseases or medical conditions, they will continue to be exempt from the current licensing law. To underscore this fact, the Division of Professional Registration - State Committee of Dietitians reports that there have been no complaints about someone providing the nutrition information or advice proponents assert they are unable to provide and thus the Committee has had no reason to discipline or sanction these unlicensed providers. In short, the Dietitian Practice Act is working as intended.Despite these facts (and our national organization's ongoing efforts to collaborate with proponents to clarify misunderstandings of the law here in Missouri and elsewhere), HB 475 offers a dangerously disproportionate solution in search of a merely hypothetical problem; it would newly allow anyone without any training or background to provide complex medical nutrition therapies to patients with nutrition-related diseases and medical conditions. I urge you to oppose HB 475 to avoid grave unintended consequences ofeliminating these critical, effective, and narrowly tailored consumer protections.WITNESS APPEARANCE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES HB 475BILL NUMBER: DATE: 2/24/2021 COMMITTEE: Professional Registration and Licensing FOR INFORMATIONAL PURPOSES IN OPPOSITION TO IN SUPPORT OF TESTIFYING: WITNESS NAME THIS FORM IS PUBLIC RECORD UNDER CHAPTER 610, RSMo.

Registered dietitians are experts on nutrition and are the only individuals who should be prescribing medical nutrition therapies.

I am writing to express my opposition to HB 475. As a registered dietitian nutritionist with a Master of Science in Health Promotion and Wellness Management and a certified health education specialist, I understand and agree that access to health education for Missourians is of the utmost importance. The Exclusive Scope of Practice licensure law for dietitians does not give dietitians a monopoly on nutrition education. I support access to nutrition education for the public in Missouri. If the licensure protection of dietitians in Missouri limited access to credible nutrition education and information, I would be opposed to the limitation of access but it does not. Licensure protection for dietitians protects Missourians from those operating outside of their scope of practice in nutrition assessments and medical nutrition therapy. I know Missouri legislators wish to increase access to nutrition services. The Council of Holistic Educators and the Missouri Nutrition Alliance have rallied support using misinformation and are spreading falsehoods to support their agenda which is increasing their income without the proper education and training. Many of their testimonies ascertain that dietitians wish to keep a monopoly on nutrition education through their licensure protection, but as stated, our licensure protection does not restrict anyone from disseminating general nutrition information to support the health of Missourians. Several of their testimonies point to a blatant overstepping of non-qualified professionals providing medical nutrition therapy that can be potentially harmful. There is an overabundance of nutrition misinformation. Dietitians are bound by a Code of Ethics to do no harm and protect the public by providing evidence-based information and tailored medical nutrition therapy informed by nutrition assessments using the Nutrition Care Process (NCP). The NCP is a standardized, evidence-based processed that dietitians are required to master through years of education and supervised practice. Only dietitians have the education and training to provide Medical Nutrition Therapy. Nutrition assessment performed by unqualified practitioners put's individuals at risk for health complications. For example, a patient seen by a health coach was put on a keto diet for weight loss. They were referred to a dietitian and were found to have malnutrition caused by malabsorption of nutrients due to not have a gallbladder. If the patient had a proper assessment by a trained professional, they would have never been put on such a high fat diet. Another example, a client was provided an individualized meal plan from a non-qualified health coach who demonized sugar and dairy due to misinformation. The client developed orthorexia, a form of disordered eating, out of fear of consuming toxic foods. The facts are Missourians already have access to nutrition education resources through cooking demonstrations and cooking classes, children's nutrition classes through the state extension office, WIC offices providing education to their clients, gardening classes, through social media, health and wellness coaches and more. These persons are protected under the following exemptions to the current law: 324.206 (5) Individuals who do not hold themselves out as dietitians marketing or distributing food products including dietary supplements as defined by the Food and Drug Administration or engaging in the explanation and education of customers regarding the use ofsuch products. 324.206(6) Any person furnishing general nutrition information as to the use of food, food materials, or dietary supplements, nor prevent in anyway the free dissemination of literature; provided, however, no such individual may call himself for herself a dietitian unless he or she is licensed under this chapter.Missourians deserve protection from those working outside of their scope of practice. Dietitians work alongside other allied health professionals such as speech therapists, physician assistants, physical therapists, occupational therapists, nurse practitioners, and more, who must complete a specific education requirements to provide specialized medical treatments/therapies. I urge you to refer to the harm reports that have been submitted showing instances of when unqualified nutrition coaches have harmed the health of Missourians through practicing based on information not supported by science. Thank you for all you do to protect the health and safety of Missourians.

As a Missouri resident, a registered dietitian nutritionist, and an educator of future dietitians, I strongly oppose the changes proposed in HB 475 relating to the Licensure of Dietitians.In order to be eligible for credentialing, Registered Dietitian Nutritionist (RDN) students must complete a rigorous educational curriculum that includes human biology, organic chemistry, and biochemistry. They also learn, in detail, the pathophysiology of various disease states and their nutritional implications. At a minimum, RDN students earn a 4-year undergraduate degree which, beginning in 2024, will be upgraded to a master's degree requirement. Finally, they complete at least 1200 hours of supervised practice (internship) that involves hands-on practice in the field. Due to their extensive education, RDNs are highly trained and qualified practitioners and should be the only professionals providing medical nutrition therapy, or MNT. Our nutrition care process begins with a thorough assessment of an individual's medical, social, and dietary history which lays the groundwork for a nutrition diagnosis and an individualized plan. Missouri's Dietitian Practice Act (Chapter 324.200-324.225 RSMo) was enacted in 1998 to protect the public from demonstrated harm and to recognize the education standards needed to provide vital health care services to the public and it has worked effectively for more than twenty years.

In conclusion, I strongly urge you to oppose the changes to HB 475 and keep Missouri's Dietitian Practice Act intact to only allow properly trained and credentialed Registered Dietitian Nutritionists to practice individualized nutrition assessment.

As a Registered Dietitian for more than 30 years in the State of Missouri, I can well state that I have seen many instances of medical harm and financial waste when it comes to any unregulated distribution and dissemination of nutrition information, and Missourians would only be seeking harm in further moving away from the current structure. True to the nature and history of Missouri, the state stands as a hallmark of protecting the health and well-being of it's citizens from potentially misleading misinformation, when other states have turned away from such opportunities to remain strong.

My name is Jean Howard, and I've been a registered dietitian for over 30 years, and a licensed dietitian in Missouri since dietitian licensure became law. My undergraduate and Masters degrees in dietetics, my training under the supervision of qualified dietitians, and then my successful completion of the national registration exam for dietitians all provided me with the knowledge and practical experience necessary to perform nutrition assessments and provide people accurate nutrition information that will help them get well and stay well. A good part of my work involves nutrition assessment and individualized nutrition guidance and recommendations. HB 475 would allow anyone to perform nutrition assessments, without using science to back their evaluation or advice. It only takes a perusal of the internet to see that there is all sorts of persuasive, but contradictory nutrition advice spouted by people who possess very little of the knowledge of nutrition, biology, physiology, biochemistry, and psychology that dietitians use every day to help people.

I have dealt with unqualified practioners giving false and incorrect information to patients, and this resulting in harm occurring that required hospitalization. Diabetics thinking they could avoid taking their insulin or other medication, and instead thinking a drink or \"magic\" pill encouraged by a chiropractor was better advice. Qualified practioners are educated by more than reading one nutrition book, we attend 4 year colleges or universities, then undergo entensive job supervised training before sitting for national board qualified exam, just like a registered nurse (RN). Would you allow an unqualified RN treat you? By allowing unqualified individuals give false often incorrect information before understanding the whole patient/individual's whole medical history and goals.

It is incredibly concerning that the health and well being of individuals could potentially be unintentionally compromised by letting unqualified practitioners provide nutrition therapy to consumers. Registered Dietitians are the experts in providing evidenced based practices, and are highly trained to filter through research, nutrition trends and misinformation. Nutrition therapy can be very complex and multifaceted, and individuals who do not have the appropriate credentials could potentially give harmful nutrition information, which we have seen cause health issues and/or disordered eating patterns. Disordered eating is on the rise, and is increasingly reported in children and adolescents, leading to lifelong struggles. Giving well intended but poor dietary advice and counseling can and does cause more harm than good in many situations. It is essential that nutrition therapy be research based, individualized, and given by a licensed trained Registered Dietitian.WITNESS APPEARANCE FORMMISSOURI HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES HB 475BILL NUMBER: DATE: 2/24/2021 COMMITTEE: Professional Registration and Licensing FOR INFORMATIONAL PURPOSES IN OPPOSITION TO IN SUPPORT OF TESTIFYING: WITNESS NAME IS PUBLIC RECORD UNDER CHAPTER 610, RSMo. Hello,Proper licensure of professions that are integral to physical wellbeing is important for patient safety. Because dietary recommendations can mean the difference between health and a life of obesity, diabetes, and cardiovascular disease, it is important that patients only receive care from professionals with a proven record of education and training. Registered Dietitians (RDs) require a minimum of four years in a program accredited by the Accreditation Council for Education in Nutrition and Dietetics (ACEND), and then a verification statement from a Didactic Program in Dietetics (DPD). Next, RDs need a minimum of 1200 hours of training under a practicing RD, followed by a licensing exam. In addition, RDs are required to complete ongoing education for the duration of their career. Nutritionists do not need any of the above to practice. Do not let patient care suffer at the hands of charlatans and snake oil salesmen when there are experienced professionals ready and willing to take on the job.Sincerely,Jeremy HousekeeperMedical Student, University of Cincinnati College of MedicineWITNESS OF REPRESENTATIVES HB 475BILL NUMBER: DATE: 2/24/2021 COMMITTEE: Professional Registration and Licensing FOR INFORMATIONAL PURPOSES IN OPPOSITION TO IN SUPPORT OF TESTIFYING: WITNESS NAME THIS FORM IS PUBLIC RECORD UNDER CHAPTER 610, RSMo. I am writing in opposition of this bill with a need to maintain Missouri licensure for Registered Dietitians as the qualified practitioner to provide medical nutrition therapy in preventing and improving chronic conditions associated with poor diet and lifestyle. If this bill is passed it would be a disservice to our communities because unqualified individuals conducting nutrition assessments do not have the skills and knowledge to treat multiple medical problems. Registered Dietitians are able to conduct detailed nutrition focused physical findings to find the root of the problem or pick up on nutrient deficiencies that otherwise may lead to a misdiagnosis. I have worked with Veterans for the past 11 years in multiple care areas from Home Based Primary Care to rehab to my current position in an outpatient clinic. As a Registered Dietitian I have continues to build my knowledge and skills through continuing education opportunities in efforts to work alongside Veterans with complicated health conditions. These Veterans come to us with not just one nutrition related condition but multiple medical conditions that require an intense review of their body systems to gain better understanding of what dietary approach to take to best assist them with their wellness needs and goals. An unlicensed person would not be able to conduct the appropriate nutrition assessment to design a diet best suited for someone with complex medical conditions.

I am in opposition of HB475. Registered dietitians are required to have a bachelors degree. After completion of the degree they are required to have at least 1200 hours of supervised practice to be eligible to take the registration exam for dietitians. After passing the exam, the registered dietitian must maintain certification through continuing education and required to adhere to a code of ethics. These requirements are to ensure that competent individuals are providing science-based information to the people who utilize the services of a registered dietitian. My fear is, that without these safe guards, people seeking nutrition information will receive misinformation and spend money and time following programs that are not geared towards overall health of the individual. There are many programs out there that will help people obtain the results of weight reduction, but at the cost of the physical and mental health of the individual.

Simply put, HB 475 is misleading and dangerous to your constituents because the terms \"individualized nutrition assessment, guidance, encouragement, recommendations, or weight control\" sound like low-risk services, when they are not. These services, especially individualized nutrition assessment and recommendations, have multiple hidden layers that are only recognized by practitioners who are trained to know the complexities related to these services. Many patients have complex medical conditions or needs that require expertise only taught in medical nutrition therapy courses that is possessed by Registered Dietitians. Registered Dietitians complete 5 to 6 years of education, a post-baccalaureate dietetic internship during which they complete over 1000 hours of supervised practice to hone the skills learned in their academic studies, and 15 hours of continuing education per year to maintain current knowledge in the field. In addition, Dietitians must abide by a code of ethics that protects your constituents who are often tempted by dangerous fad diets, quick fixes, and holistic treatments that may not be safe or evidenced based. This code of ethics obligates dietitians to only utilize evidence-based recommendations and therapies. Unfortunately, well- intentioned individuals without proper training often promote fads and dangerous quick fixes without realizing the harm they may cause. Many proponents of HB 475 who wish to provide aspects of medical nutrition therapy have only completed a short online or workshop-style training program in nutrition that did not culminate in an accredited four-year degree. What is even more dangerous about HB 475 is that there is no stipulation mentioned that requires even that small bit of education. The bill literally says \"Any person\" will be able to provide these services that fall under the medical nutrition therapy umbrella. Can you imagine \"any person\" assessing your nutrition and health, then giving you dietary guidance to cure your illnesses?Even scarier, imagine someone you care about or love who is sick and desperate for help turning to \"any person\" who claims to have the answers. Wouldn't you want them to instead seek the help of someone who has had years of training in an accredited nutrition program, 1000+ hours of supervised application of knowledge, and passed a national credentialing examination?

As a dietetic intern preparing to be a registered dietitian (RD) in my sixth consecutive year of academic study, I am asking you to oppose HB-475. In addition to my nutrition background, I am also a certified personal trainer (CPT). Before beginning my nutrition classes, I had to take two years of intense science and humanities classes, including pre-med chemistry, organic chemistry, biochemistry, human physiology, and health care ethics. Before beginning to study nutrition, I had to understand the mechanisms of how nutrition works on a cellular level. I also took an entire course on reading and interpreting scientific literature. In addition to science, I also had to learn about the interpersonal skills of conducting nutrition assessments and nutrition therapy, both in the classroom and in my practical internship that requires 1200 practice hours. Over the course of my internship, I have learned there is no class or course that can prepare one for the nuances of assessing nutrition and performing nutrition therapy. It is something that is best learned through supervision after years of building a knowledge base.Greater access to registered dietitians and dietary services would improve the health of Missourians. But decreasing the qualifications for licensure is not a safe option for Missourians. While studying for my CPT exam, which covers some broad nutrition topics, I was told to not consider the in-depth nutrition training I had received, as that might be counted as incorrect on the exam. Requiring licensed dietitians to have completed their bachelor's degree and dietetic internship ensures that the public is receiving research-based nutrition information. It also ensures that they receive it in a matter that will not harm them (i.e. perpetuate unhealthy habits surrounding food). Dietetics is a medical field that requires years of study to practice, just like many other medical fields. Allowing those without these credentials and experiences to assess clients and perform nutrition therapy would harm Missourians. It would expose Missourians to harmful misinformation, practices, or improper or incomplete assessments. Investing in licensed dietitians and programs to promote their access to the community is the safest way for Missourians to receive quality nutrition care. Please vote NO on HB- 475.WITNESS APPEARANCE 2/24/2021 COMMITTEE: Professional Registration and Licensing FOR INFORMATIONAL PURPOSES IN OPPOSITION TO IN SUPPORT OF TESTIFYING: WITNESS NAME THIS FORM IS PUBLIC RECORD UNDER CHAPTER 610, RSMo. To the layman, the difference in verbiage of \"Nutritionist\", \"Holistic Practitioner\", and \"Dietician\" are all the same. In practice, this could not be further from the truth and only further muddies the issue. We owe it to our neighbors to provide the type of care that only a properly educated and licensed individual can provide. What we do not owe is an incentive for monetarily-driven shortcuts for lackluster care provided by those who were already unwilling to become properly licensed in the first place. Our hard- working, educated health providers deserve better.WITNESS APPEARANCE REPRESENTATIVES HB 475BILL NUMBER: DATE: 2/24/2021 COMMITTEE: Professional Registration and Licensing FOR INFORMATIONAL PURPOSES IN OPPOSITION TO IN SUPPORT OF TESTIFYING: WITNESS NAME THIS FORM IS PUBLIC RECORD UNDER CHAPTER 610, RSMo. A registered and licensed dietitian is the most qualified to practice medical nutrition therapy. A registered dietitian not only takes courses on nutrition and food, but also the biochemistry and metabolism processes within nutrition. A registered dietitian must complete a 1200 hour internship to be eligible to sit for the registration exam. Therefore, it is pertinent that dietitians licensure is protected and that dietitians are the sole individuals allowed to practice medical nutrition therapy.Judy Milliano, Mizzou 2/24/2021 COMMITTEE: Professional Registration and Licensing FOR INFORMATIONAL PURPOSES IN OPPOSITION TO IN SUPPORT OF TESTIFYING: WITNESS NAME THIS FORM IS PUBLIC RECORD UNDER CHAPTER 610, RSMo. The proposed changes would eliminate protections for the health and wellbeing of the public by letting unqualified practitioners provide nutrition assessments to patients with nutrition-related diseases and medical conditions, thereby undermining the current licensure law. Consumers need safe, reliable and evidence-based practices appropriate for their individual needs, diseases, health conditions and complex dietary requirements. I oppose these bills in order to ensure Missourians are protected from unqualified practitioners and unintended consequences associated with eliminating key protections in our state. I currently work as a dietitian in the hospital setting and see that many of my patients have received misinformation that they are following which ended up being not an appropriate diet for them to follow. Many of my heart failure patients are interested in the keto diet which is actually not beneficial for them because the foods on keto often are higher in sodium. By allowing only registered dietitians to provide education to the public, many people will be saved from following harmful information.WITNESS APPEARANCE FORMMISSOURI HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES HB 475BILL NUMBER: DATE: 2/24/2021 COMMITTEE: Professional Registration and Licensing FOR INFORMATIONAL PURPOSES IN OPPOSITION TO IN SUPPORT OF TESTIFYING: WITNESS THIS FORM IS PUBLIC RECORD UNDER CHAPTER 610, RSMo.

Action Alert LanguageAs your constituent, a registered dietitian nutritionist, and a member of Missouri Academy of Nutrition and Dietetics, I strongly oppose the changes proposed in HB 475 relating to the Licensure of Dietitians.Missouri's Dietitian Practice Act (Chapter 324.200-324.225 RSMo) was enacted in 1998 to protect the public from demonstrated harm and to recognize the education standards needed to provide vital health care services to the public and it has worked effectively for more than twenty years. The proposed exemption in HB 475 would swallow the rule, eliminating key protections for Missourians seeking to treat or manage diseases and other medical conditions.To be clear, the current law does not prevent anyone from \"talk[ing] with individual clients about healthy eating and nutrition\" and unless unlicensed individuals are seeking to provide individualized counseling to treat or manage patients and clients with diseases or medical conditions, they will continue to be exempt from the current licensing law. To underscore this fact, the Division of Professional Registration - State Committee of Dietitians reports that there have been no complaints about someone providing the nutrition information or advice proponents assert they are unable to provide and thus the Committee has had no reason to discipline or sanction these unlicensed providers. In short, the Dietitian Practice Act is working as intended.Despite these facts (and our national organization's ongoing efforts to collaborate with proponents to clarify misunderstandings of the law here in Missouri and elsewhere), HB 475 offers a dangerously disproportionate solution in search of a merely hypothetical problem; it would newly allow anyone without any training or background to provide complex medical nutrition therapies to patients with nutrition-related diseases and medical conditions. I urge you to oppose HB 475 to avoid grave unintended consequences of eliminating these critical, effective, and narrowly tailored consumer protections.WITNESS APPEARANCE FORMMISSOURI HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES HB 475BILL NUMBER: DATE: 2/24/2021 COMMITTEE: Professional Registration and Licensing FOR INFORMATIONAL PURPOSES IN OPPOSITION TO IN SUPPORT OF TESTIFYING: WITNESS NAME INDIVIDUAL: WITNESS THIS FORM IS PUBLIC RECORD UNDER CHAPTER 610, RSMo. Dear committee members:I have over 10 years experience working as a licensed registered dietitian. All of the years I have been a dietitian, I have been licensed; most of those years have been in the state of Missouri. I am grateful to the Missouri legislature for passing the dietitian licensure law all those years ago.The point of a professional license is to ensure that the person holding it is qualified to perform the job, correct? The type of clients I have treated over the years have had an array of complex medical issues, including diabetes, premature birth/low birth weight, failure-to-thrive, genetic disorders, autism, eating disorders, epilepsy, cerebral palsy, and receiving nutrition via a feeding tube, just to name a few. What will happen if this bill passes? Is Missouri ready to allow for anyone, evidence of education, training, and experience or not, to provide nutrition care to such individuals and others?Your constituents need reliable care that is founded in evidence-based practice that is appropriate for their individual needs, diseases, health conditions, and complex/nuanced dietary requirements. Registered dietitians are the healthcare professionals who have had the education, training, and experience who meet that standard. Ask yourselves this: would you fly on a plane without assurances that the pilot was trained? Would you choose an eye doctor that is licensed or would you not? How about for your hairstylist or barber? If you answered that you preferred that your pilot, eye doctor, and hair stylist or barber was licensed (and therefore met some sort of regulatory standard) over the one who was not, why hold a lower standard for nutrition care for your constituents?The Missouri legislature has defeated a similar bill in the past. Please, I ask that you vote with common sense and OPPOSE HB475 and uphold the dietitian licensure law to ensure the health and well-being of your constituents.Thank you for your time and consideration.Karen Donelson, MS, RD, NUMBER: DATE: 2/24/2021 COMMITTEE: Professional Registration and Licensing FOR INFORMATIONAL PURPOSES IN OPPOSITION TO IN SUPPORT OF TESTIFYING: WITNESS NAME INDIVIDUAL: THIS FORM IS PUBLIC RECORD UNDER CHAPTER 610, RSMo. Thank you for allowing me to submit my testimony in opposition to House Bill 475 regarding changing the licensure of Registered Dietitian/Nutritionists (RDNs) in the state of Missouri. My main opposition is the provision in HB 475 that allows any person to \"provide individualized nutrition assessment.\" Nutrition science is a science, not just someone's ideology about eating choices. Allowing those who are not licensed and do not have appropriate education to provide nutrition assessment is dangerous to the health of Missourians and allows irreputable practices to be promulgated.To provide some background, RDNs have rigorous academic training that includes a minimum of a bachelor's degree from an accredited university, a 9-12 month didactic internship, successfully passing a registration examination, plus ongoing professional continuing education. In my present work with 50 other Registered Dietitian/Nutritionists, we also have master's degrees and specialized certifications. The scope of practice for dietitians includes assessment, nutrition diagnosis, intervention, and evaluation and monitoring. There is specific training for each area which is strengthened by a broad academic background in physiology, chemistry, and food science/nutrition.Unfortunately, misinformation is rampant that non-RDN practitioners are unable to practice in the state of Missouri, see individual clients, or ask questions about a person's history. That is untrue and misleads the Committee. There are many different ways non-RDN nutritionists can practice in Missouri, including talking to clients and asking questions. These include school nutrition programs, WIC, weight control programs, and Extension, to name a few. Nutrition providers are allowed to disseminate nutrition education, conduct classes, work with individuals and families, and provide guidance for lifestyle changes. In the current licensing laws, there are already 6 exemptions that allow individual nutritionists to talk with their clients as long as the professionals do not claim to be dietitians. Two of them are listed below: 324.206 (5) Individuals who do not hold themselves out as dietitians marketing or distributing food products including dietary supplements as defined by the Food and Drug Administration or engaging in the explanation and education of customers regarding the use of such products. 324.206(6) Any person furnishing general nutrition information as to the use of food, food materials, or dietary supplements, nor prevent in any way the free dissemination of literature; provided, however, no such individual may call himself for herself a dietitian unless he or she is licensed under this chapter.The purpose of licensure laws is to protect the public. Please review the present licensing laws and realize that nutrition practitioners such as health coaches or nutrition educators who claim they are unable to practice is blatantly false. They have been practicing for years and will continue to be allowed to do so under present law.For your interest, I would like to provide a few examples of patients I have cared for who experienced harm from unlicensed nutrition providers: - A 52-year old woman was having abdominal pain so sought care from a naturopath/nutritionist. She was told that her body could not assimilate protein so she was put on a diet of grape juice and alfalfa sprout juice. She followed this regimen for 3 year until she was admitted to the hospital. She hadkwashiorkor which is severe protein malnutrition and is often seen in underdeveloped countries. Her abdomen was excessively distended and her legs were swollen with edema. Her kidneys and liver were in failure. She was unable to be restored to health and passed away within 2 months.-A 6 year boy was referred to me for multiple food allergies. When he came to clinic, his mother had a list of 85 foods that he was \"allergic\" to that had been diagnosed by a local \"allergist\". The boy's mother said that he did not have any reactions to most of the foods on the list but they had removed them anyway. The boy was not allowed to eat any milk products, grains, meats, fruits, and only a few vegetables--he only had a few choices. He was losing weight, had hair that was thinning, and looked emaciated. He was able to be restored to health with proper nutrition.-A 9 month old baby was being fed watered- down formula because the mom said she was told to add extra water. The baby was lethargic, could not crawl, and could hardly hold his head up. When the appropriate formula concentration was provided, he began to grow and began to meet developmental milestones within a short time period.Please consider the importance of dietitian licensure and the benefit it provides. It is the right thing to do for Missourians.Karen Stephens, MS,RD, CSP,LDWITNESS 2/24/2021 COMMITTEE: Professional Registration and Licensing FOR INFORMATIONAL PURPOSES IN OPPOSITION TO IN SUPPORT OF TESTIFYING: WITNESS NAME THIS FORM IS PUBLIC RECORD UNDER CHAPTER 610, RSMo.

This bill goes directly against Missouri Division of Professional registrations licensing laws regarding the scope of practice for dietitians.

Being able to offer nutritional education, assessments, and care requires extensive education, supervision, and practice that all Registered Dietitians receive through vigorous schooling and hands on experience. The proposed changes would eliminate protections for the health and wellbeing of the public by letting unqualified practitioners provide nutrition assessments to patients with nutrition- related diseases and medical conditions, thereby undermining the current licensure law. The Registered Dietitian plays an extremely valuable roll within the interdisciplinary health care team through all functions of medicine. The Registered Dietitian is looked at as THE nutrition expert of the team by the nursing staff, therapists, social workers, pharmacists, physicians and more. Their role is vital and not one of the highly qualified health professionals on that team could offer the knowledge and expertise the Registered Dietitian brings. Putting this legislation into practice would not only sabotage qualified nutrition professionals and put their careers at stake, but put the Missouri population at risk of unqualified, inaccurate and perilous nutrition information. Consumers need safe, reliable and evidence-based practices appropriate for their individual needs, diseases, health conditions and complex dietary requirements.

The proposed changes of this bill would eliminate protections for the health and well-being of the public by letting unqualified practitioners provide nutrition assessments to patients with nutrition-related diseases and medical conditions.

Members of the House Professional Registration and Licensing Committee: I am writing to you regarding House Bill 475 introduced by Representative Grier. HB 475 would allow any person to \"provide individualized nutrition assessment to treat any type of medical condition\". \"Any type of medical condition\" is a scary term for me. My husband suffers from End Stage Renal Failure and is a dialysis patient. \"Nutrition Professionals\" are not trained or qualified to prescribe a diet for him and your countless other constituents who suffer from these types of diseases. By allowing untrained and unlicensed professionals to provide such individuals nutritional education, you will be putting your constituents in harm's way. As many proponents of the Bill have stated, nutrition education for the public is critical but poor nutrition is at the root of many medical conditions. Misinformation and quackery from unlicensed and improperly trained individuals in order to sell services and/or supplements could have catastrophic implications to public health. Dietitians have a minimum of a bachelor's degree; have completed academic requirements of a didactic program in dietetics; 1200 hours of supervised practice, successfully completed the registration examination for dietitians; and accrue seventy-five hours of approved continuing professional units every five years. Dietitians and other qualified healthcare professionals are specifically trained to do nutritional assessments.There are 6 exemptions in the current law that allow individual professionals to talk with their clients about food, diet and nutrition, as long as the person involved does not hold himself or herself out as a dietitian. Exemptions 5 and 6 are referenced below: 324.206 (5) \"Individuals who do not hold themselves out as dietitians marketing or distributing food products including dietary supplements as defined by the Food and Drug Administration or engaging in the explanation and education of customers regarding the use of such products\". 324.206(6) \"Any person furnishing general nutrition information as to the use of food, food materials, or dietary supplements, nor prevent in any way the free dissemination of literature; provided, however, no such individual may call himself for herself a dietitian unless he or she is licensed under this chapter\".

My name is Kerri Lee and I am a senior dietetics student at Fontbonne University in St. Louis. Although I was able to give testimony in person this morning I want to reiterate that I am in strongly opposed to HB 475. The area of concern is the verbiage within the bill stating that ANYONE can give nutrition guidance. The group in favor of this bill who shared testimony in person this morning had Bachelor's degrees, Master's degrees, nutrition/holistic/ health coaching certifications from various organizations. To the representatives listening who do not understand the expertise of Dietitians, they appeared credible. What I will say is the group present this morning does not represent the majority. This group took it upon themselves to further their education whereas the average \"nutritionist\" who obtained an online certificate (in 3 months, 6 months, a year, there is no standard or governing group to mandate this) may not share that same initiative. Due to this and the verbiage of HB 475, stating ANYONE, including these are very unqualified individuals, would be able to provide nutrition assessment and put the public at risk. Dietitians are the only nutrition professionals qualified to perform individualized care and nutrition assessment as they are required to have a Bachelor's degree, Master's degree, undergo 1,200 hours of supervised practice, pass a national registration exam, plus 75 hours of continuing education every 5 years. These education requirements are developed and overseen by one governing body to ensure that all dietitians are practicing in a manner that supports science and adhering to our Code of Ethics.

As a resident of Missouri, a registered dietitian, and a member of the Missouri Academy of Nutrition and Dietetics, I strongly oppose the changes proposed in HB 475, relating to the Licensure of Dietitians. Allowing individuals lacking in adequate training to provide complex medical nutrition therapy advice to the public would put the public in severe risk. Dietitians spend many years learning about biochemistry in the human body, how diseases develop and progress, and how food can impact our health, both positively and negatively. For example, if an undiagnosed diabetic is told to follow the popular Keto diet , they could end up in the ER very quickly; a dietitian knows how to work with clients on proper meal planning, instead of fad diets. Recommending high protein diets and using excessive high protein supplements can increase the risk of developing or worsening heart disease, cancer, gout, osteoporosis and renal disease; a dietitian knows how to properly assess the clients needs to prevent and lessen the impact of these diseases. Most untrained and unlicensed individuals do not have access to a client's lab results or fully understand how to read and apply the information to the patient; dietitians have this training and can correctly recommend appropriate foods and vitamin supplements to decrease the risk and treat the leading causes of death in the US - heart disease, cancer, diabetes, kidney disease, and liver disease. Dietitians spend many years becoming food experts and are a wealth of knowledge on how to improve the health of the citizens of Missouri. They have expertise in weight loss, eating disorders, cancer survival, diabetes, heart disease, hypertension and more. YOU ARE WHAT YOU EAT! These food experts are the best resource for protecting the health of your constituents. Allowing untrained individuals to \"play\" expert will result in denying consumers the protection they deserve. I urge you to oppose HB 475.WITNESS APPEARANCE 2/24/2021 COMMITTEE: Professional Registration and Licensing FOR INFORMATIONAL PURPOSES IN OPPOSITION TO IN SUPPORT OF TESTIFYING: WITNESS NAME THIS FORM IS PUBLIC RECORD UNDER CHAPTER 610, RSMo. I ask that you vote no on HB 475. As a registered and licensed Dietitian in the state of Missouri, I have undergone significant training and education to attain those credentials. I have a nutrition degree from Saint Louis University, and completed a Dietetic Internship over the time of 1 year to practice skills in a multitude of different settings. It is dangerous to give individuals who have not had this extensive education process the ability to perform nutrition assessments and evaluations. I have seen first hand working at a hospital what the consequences could be of giving false nutrition advice to patients. As a Dietitian in a clinical setting, I assess patients in an adult and pediatric realm. Specifically, I calculate feeding goals for infants and make recommendations to the Neonatologists to assist in growth. The ability to do this has taken years of practice and education required by the current registration and license guidelines. It is important for health care professionals (and all professionals for that matter) to not extend into other scopes of practice that is not his or her expertise.

Hello, I am a dietitian who specializes in eating disorders (EDs) and have personally heard multiple stories of harm done by practitioners without dietitian licensure; these were shared last year, and I have included them again below. I would be glad to privately share information that identifies each associated practitioner if that will be helpful. In some instances, I am positive that the patients/clients don't know that they endured any harm, which is part of the problem. Some instances are seemingly very minor and possibly not a big deal to someone who isn't familiar with EDs, but EDs are the bulk of my practice, so I have both expertise and bias here. I also am positive that some of the non-licensed practitioners had no intention of stepping outside the bounds of their own scope of practice, but impact matters more than intent, and na\u00efvet\u00e9 is also part of the problem here. Eating disorders are widespread, and the potential for harm is great. For reference, here are some statistics from the National Association for Anorexia Nervosa and Associated Disorders (references included at end): --At least 30 million people of all ages and genders suffer from an eating disorder in the U.S. 1, 2--Every 62 minutes at least one person dies as a direct result from an eating disorder. 3--Eating disorders have the highest mortality rate of any mental illness. 4Of note, I believe that the last statistic is recently outdated due to the rise in mortality from opioid use disorders.I have a Master of Science in Nutrition degree from Bastyr University, which is among the top institutions for natural medicine in the world. I am trained in integrative and functional medicine, I deeply value it, and I use it both personally and in practice as a dietitian. I also understand the laws of supply and demand, as well as a free market, personal risk, and the role of government in these matters. I understand the public desire and need for more reliable and holistic health information. Still, I firmly believe that there must be regulation in order to protect the public. I understand that many question this, but the reality is that all sorts of services\u2014medical, dental, barber, landscaping, and literally hundreds more\u2014are regulated in the state of Missouri. Nutrition services should be no different. I thank you sincerely for your time and consideration and ask that you please, please oppose HB 475. Stories of harm:With a teen ED patient, practitioner has justified eating a particular snack because the snack is \"healthy\", when the reality is that the patient is underweight, chronically undereats, and needs a snack regardless of whether or not the practitioner thinks it to be a \"healthy\" snack. Patient continues to struggle with eating when hungry.With a teen ED patient, practitioner recommended eating a serving of carrots daily when the teen was struggling to eat anything. Teen experienced medical decline quickly and was admitted to an inpatient facility. Parents and teen later realized/verbalized that practitioner's nutrition advice was unhelpful and established with a dietitian upon discharge from inpatient treatment.With an adult ED patient, practitioner has been supportive of vegan diet and self-disclosed to patient her own decision to abstain from eating animal products. Practitioner additionally recommended a specific multivitamin to the patient without doing any type of health assessment.With an adult patient with long history of restrictive ED and diabetes mellitus type 1, practitioner recommended various diet restrictions. Patientreached out to dietitian for second opinion but elected to not see dietitian and continue seeing other practitioner. One year later, patient presented to dietitian with disordered eating, underweight status, and uncontrolled diabetes. Patient stated that work with other practitioner was harmful and that she ceased seeing her shortly after initial contact with dietitian but continued to decline until presentation to dietitian one year later.With an adult patient who has a 25+ year history of an ED, practitioner recommended extensive food-related testing, as well as extremely restrictive diets based on results of said testing. Patient stated acknowledgment of potential harmful impact to dietitian, at which point dietitian was able to educate patient re: contraindication of restrictive diet in active restrictive ED; patient then declined to proceed with restrictive diet.With an adult client with a long history of disordered eating, depression, and endocrine disorders, practitioner recommended diet described by patient as \"extremely restrictive\". Patient reported diet difficult to follow and discouraged by practitioner's \"disappointment\" in her. Patient noted practitioner to self-disclose her own extremely restrictive diet, which was also discouraging to patient. Patient noted physical health, mental health, and relationship with food continued to decline after stopping work with practitioner and until seeking other care by an MD and dietitian.References:--Hudson, J.

This bill will hurt the individuals of Missouri by allowing those without formal credible accredited nutrition education to perform services to the public.

Hello. I am a Registered Dietitian licensed in the state of Missouri. I am writing in opposition to HB475 which is to be heard tomorrow. HB475 has the potential to place many Missourians' health at risk. There is already rampant and widespread misinformation on the topics of health and nutrition, and I believe that HB475 could worsen this situation by giving a false sense of security when an individual receives said information from a potentially unqualified source. As Registered Dietitians, we are required to take multiple courses in biology and chemistry, in addition to our extensive study of nutrition. Beyond that, we receive training in ethics in healthcare practice, as well as a deeper understanding of the quality of research and nutritional studies. We not only learn the nutritional values of foods, but how to advise our clients with the whole picture in mind, including not only the foods themselves, but our client's overall health, family situation, and financial situation. We are held to an high ethical standard as Registered Dietitians, and are required to maintain continuing education and ethics education. There are regularly evaluated and updated Standards of Practice to guide the decisions and recommendations of Registered Dietitians, and we are held responsible for our actions. It reminds me of conversations I frequently have with my father. Despite over 6 years of education and my RD and LD qualifications, he doesn't listen to me in regard to nutrition. He prefers to use the internet to watch videos about fad diets. I often hear these videos when visiting him and see all the choices he makes based upon them, and it makes me sad. The individuals he listens to claim to be experts and to have extensive backgrounds of study in nutrition and health, and I actually believe that is probably true. The problem is the one thing they don't have--standards of conduct or ethics. They can bash widely recognized and accepted health agencies in our country and make any extra recommendations they want, even if potentially harmful to the listeners, because they won't be held accountable for what happens to the viewers' health in the same way that an RD working in a hospital would. One in particular often talks about how research from the US government regarding nutrition is slow, inaccurate, never changes, etc. and how he, essentially, \"knows better.\" What many listeners like my father don't think about, however, is why. Government organizations or large nutrition associations move slowly to change national recommendations because changes are based on a large and extensive body of research. Nutritional recommendations are based upon multiple randomized controlled trials and large studies, not on anecdotal evidence. Following these types of gurus online is my father's choice. He is aware of the risk. What would be tragic to see is this type of information being provided to those who go to a medical facility or hospital in Missouri, where they expect to receive the highest level of care, and instead receive little more than what they could find on the internet. This isn't to say that no one other than RDs can be knowledgeable in nutrition--of course not. But it is to say that there is more than knowledge of nutrition gained from a textbook that matters-- there are standards and codes for public safety that are to be held to. If you think of a nutritional recommendation like a pill, wouldn't the public deserve to take a \"pill\" that has been tested and tried and found to be safe?Inreviewing HB475, I hope you will consider that many of the above statements regarding safety and ethics of practice cannot be said for individuals who are not Registered and Licensed dietitians. They are not under these clearly defined Standards of Practice and their education and training is not guaranteed to include the components which have been deemed safe and necessary to practice Medical Nutrition Therapy. This in no way diminishes their knowledge or understanding of nutrition-- many have done extensive study. It simply means that Missourians will be protected from potential harm by unqualified individuals practicing under the scope of an RD without the extensive education and training needed to do so.Thank you for your time.

As your constituent, a registered dietitian nutritionist, and a member of Missouri Academy of Nutrition and Dietetics, I strongly oppose the changes proposed in HB 475 relating to the Licensure of Dietitians.Missouri's Dietitian Practice Act (Chapter 324.200-324.225 RSMo) was enacted in 1998 to protect the public from demonstrated harm and to recognize the education standards needed to provide vital health care services to the public and it has worked effectively for more than twenty years. The proposed exemption in HB 475 would swallow the rule, eliminating key protections for Missourians seeking to treat or manage diseases and other medical conditions.To be clear, the current law does not prevent anyone from \"talk[ing] with individual clients about healthy eating and nutrition\" and unless unlicensed individuals are seeking to provide individualized counseling to treat or manage patients and clients with diseases or medical conditions, they will continue to be exempt from the current licensing law. To underscore this fact, the Division of Professional Registration - State Committee of Dietitians reports that there have been no complaints about someone providing the nutrition information or advice proponents assert they are unable to provide and thus the Committee has had no reason to discipline or sanction these unlicensed providers. In short, the Dietitian Practice Act is working as intended.Despite these facts (and our national organization's ongoing efforts to collaborate with proponents to clarify misunderstandings of the law here in Missouri and elsewhere), HB 475 offers a dangerously disproportionate solution in search of a merely hypothetical problem; it would newly allow anyone without any training or background to provide complex medical nutrition therapies to patients with nutrition-related diseases and medical conditions. I urge you to oppose HB 475 to avoid grave unintended consequences of eliminating these critical, effective, and narrowly tailored consumer protections.WITNESS APPEARANCE FORMMISSOURI HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES HB 475BILL NUMBER: DATE: 2/24/2021 COMMITTEE: Professional Registration and Licensing FOR INFORMATIONAL PURPOSES IN OPPOSITION TO IN SUPPORT OF TESTIFYING: WITNESS NAME THIS FORM IS PUBLIC RECORD UNDER CHAPTER 610, RSMo. Please vote no on HB 475. As a registered dietitian and food service director in a nursing home, I have seen first hand how people, specifically the elderly, grasp at any information they can. On numerous occasions I have had to correct misinformation that my residents have received from sources that were not credible and did not take into account their personalized medical needs. As registered dietitians, we are formally trained, credentialed, and required to perform continuing education to stay relevant in our field. I fear that enabling more people with none of the aforementioned requirements, would further confuse residents on where to receive their nutrition information and potentially provide them with information that would be detrimental to their health. Thank you for your time and consideration.WITNESS APPEARANCE FORMMISSOURI HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES HB 475BILL NUMBER: DATE: 2/24/2021 COMMITTEE: Professional Registration and Licensing FOR INFORMATIONAL PURPOSES IN OPPOSITION TO IN SUPPORT OF TESTIFYING: WITNESS NAME FORM IS PUBLIC RECORD UNDER CHAPTER 610, RSMo. Dietitians spend many years acquiring knowledge of evidence based nutritional science and practical experience applying this science appropriately. This training is critical to ensuring that practitioners do no harm when providing specific advice that can impact medical conditions and quality of life.

Missouri House Committee on Professional Registration:I am writing to express my opposition to the changes proposed in HB 475 relating to the Licensure of Dietitians. As a Registered Dietitian Nutritionist for the last 9.5 years who is also licensed in the great state of Missouri, the changes could place Missourians in great harm. As a member of the Public Policy Committee, I have been very involved in collecting statements of harm. It has been alarming to not only suspect misconduct of people calling themselves nutritionists, but to see proof written down. In one instance, a young girl with a diagnosed eating disorder was hospitalized for heart issues after following recommendations of a \"nutritionist\" at a Natural Grocer. We have several reports of harm submitted regarding recommendations received from Chiropractors, Health Coaches, Personal Trainers, and members of the Council of Holistic Health Educators. We are happy to share these specific instances to the committee as we have done in the past.To be clear, the current law does not prevent anyone from \"talk [ing] with individual clients about healthy eating and nutrition\" and unless unlicensed individuals are seeking to provide individualized counseling to treat or manage patients and clients with diseases or medical conditions, they will continue to be exempt from the current licensing law. However, there is serious risk to allowing people not credentialed (educated as we are) to provide individualized assessment and counseling. Therefore, I declare my opposition to HB 475.Sincerely, Lauren Landfried, PhD, RD, Dietetics/Saint UniversityNortheast Director/Missouri Academy of Nutrition and HB 475BILL NUMBER: DATE: 2/24/2021 COMMITTEE: Professional Registration and Licensing FOR INFORMATIONAL PURPOSES IN OPPOSITION TO IN SUPPORT OF TESTIFYING: WITNESS NAME THIS FORM IS PUBLIC RECORD UNDER CHAPTER 610, RSMo.

As a registered and licensed dietitian in the state of Missouri, I am in opposition of HB 475. To become a registered dietitian, I was required to successfully complete an undergraduate degree in dietetics/nutrition sciences, complete a minimum of 1200 hours supervised practice, and successfully pass the national registration exam set by the Commission on Dietetic Registration Committee before I was eligible to practice in the field of dietetics. \"Nutritionists,\" or people who are offering nutrition advise/counseling without the RD, LD credentials, do not have to complete any of these requirements. This not only poses a threat to the dietetics profession, but has great potential to cause harm to clients who are following the recommendations of someone who has not been properly trained in the field of dietetics.

Licensed dietitians are held to a higher standard of ethics by the CDR, they are required to have continuing education to ensure they are up to date with new research, and are the nutrition experts. Dietitians are required to have a bachelors, practicum with so many supervised hours, and pass a national test - in addition many already have their masters or speciality credential. Nutrition can be basic, but it can also be DANGEROUS! Supplements can interact with medications, dieting can lead to life threatening eating disorders, and more. Nutrition is a science. Just like you wouldn't want a plumber doing your electrical work or a mechanic performing heart surgery. Licensure not only protects the worker but protects the public.WITNESS APPEARANCE FORMMISSOURI HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES HB 475BILL NUMBER: DATE: 2/24/2021 COMMITTEE: Professional Registration and Licensing FOR INFORMATIONAL PURPOSES IN OPPOSITION TO IN SUPPORT OF TESTIFYING: WITNESS NAME THIS FORM IS PUBLIC RECORD UNDER CHAPTER 610, RSMo. I am against letting anyone without proper training or background (BS, MS) degrees in dietetics performing complex nutrition related assessments and educations. The purpose of having licensed dietitians, with 4 year specified bachelor's degrees in human anatomy and physiology, nutrition related and food related coursework, teaching and education coursework, psychology course work is so that they are able to evaluate the person as \"WHOLE\" and determine the best options regarding nutrition to treat or assist in the treatment of a condition. Not a fad diet or reliance on a person or groups opinion based on a book they read or a 1 class training certificate they earned in nutrition. I could not imagine a holistic health practitioner or a chiropractor trying to determine if a patient needs feeding thru a vein or tube and how to determine that. I can not imagine someone educating on keto (high protein diet) for someone with chronic kidney disease in late stages where they are trying to prevent getting hemodialysis (this time would require lower protein intake). The Dietitian label is purposely placed for the safety of the public, for the safety of maintaining education credentials to stay on top of research, stay within ethical boundaries, do no harm. Most people can talk about the nutrition guidelines. But to assess and educate on disease specific information could be harmful. It's happening right now, people are telling people to take zinc and vitamin c for immune support. The problem is that zinc taken long term without a Multivitamin with copper in it can create a long term deficiency that often goes unnoticed. A registered and licensed dietitian would know that and could educate the patient on the proper immune support. Don't take away the protections of the people and the trust of the people in knowing they are getting someone who has been trained and educated to help. Could you imagine the holistic health practitioner completing your physical therapy assessment after an major operation? someone who is not trained to know the movements or the proper therapy and pressure to use, the proper options to discuss with the doctor about pain? Why would you trust someone not trained to provide you the nutrition education you need?WITNESS APPEARANCE FORMMISSOURI HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES HB 475BILL NUMBER: DATE: 2/24/2021 COMMITTEE: Professional Registration and Licensing FOR INFORMATIONAL PURPOSES IN OPPOSITION TO IN SUPPORT OF TESTIFYING: WITNESS NAME THIS FORM IS PUBLIC RECORD UNDER CHAPTER 610, RSMo.

My name is Lissane Kafie and I am a current nutrition and dietetics student. I have been studying nutrition for 5 years now. I am now pursuing a Master's of Science in nutrition and a dietetic internship, completing over 1200+ of clinical practice. This year, I will be taking the RD exam and become a Registered Dietitian Nutritionist (RDN). In order to be eligible for credentialing, Registered Dietitian Nutritionist (RDN) students must complete a rigorouseducational curriculum that includes human biology, organic chemistry, and biochemistry. They alsolearn, in detail, the pathophysiology of various disease states and their nutritional implications. At aminimum, RDN students earn a 4-year undergraduate degree which, beginning in 2024, will beupgraded to a master's degree requirement. Finally, they complete at least 1200 hours of supervisedpractice (internship) that involves hands-on practice in the field. Due to their extensive education,RDNs are highly trained and qualified practitioners and should be the only professionals providingmedical nutrition therapy, or MNT. Our nutrition care process begins with a thorough assessment of anindividual's medical, social, and dietary history which lays the groundwork for a nutrition diagnosisand an individualized plan. As you might imagine, without proper training and educational background,aspects of that plan could be missed or overlooked which could have concerning and dangerouseffects on a patient's health outcome. Would you trust someone who has had 3 months of training or someone who has had over 5 years of training and 1200+ hrs of practice?WITNESS APPEARANCE NUMBER: DATE: 2/24/2021 COMMITTEE: Professional Registration and Licensing FOR INFORMATIONAL PURPOSES IN OPPOSITION TO IN SUPPORT OF TESTIFYING: WITNESS NAME THIS FORM IS PUBLIC RECORD UNDER CHAPTER 610, RSMo. I am in opposition to HB 475 because it would be harmful to Missourians to allow anyone to do nutritional assessments without proper training. The current license allows for general healthy nutrition education to be given by anyone which does not restrict wellness coaches, but restricts nutrition assessments which are part of Medical Nutrition Therapy to be provided by licensed and registered dietitians. In my work in Oncology I have seen dangerous advice given to patients regarding their diet including severe restrictions that have led to malnutrition.WITNESS APPEARANCE FORMMISSOURI HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES HB 475BILL NUMBER: DATE: 2/24/2021 COMMITTEE: Professional Registration and Licensing FOR INFORMATIONAL PURPOSES IN OPPOSITION TO IN SUPPORT OF TESTIFYING: WITNESS NAME THIS FORM IS PUBLIC RECORD UNDER CHAPTER 610, RSMo. As a Registered Dietitian Nutritionist and member of this community, I am deeply concerned about the risk to your constituents, who are also my neighbors, friends, family, and patients, with this bill. As a Registered Dietitian Nutritionist, I am uniquely qualified to provide effective, easy-to-understand, science-based information to people about how nutrition affects their health conditions. Registered Dietitian Nutritionists in the United States are required to attend an accredited Dietetics program and obtain a Bachelor's degree (in 2024 the requirement will be a Master's degree), complete at least 1000 hours as a dietetics intern providing nutrition information to people under the supervision of a Registered Dietitian Nutritionist, pass a National Exam for Registered Dietitian Nutritionists, and complete 75 hours of continuing education about nutrition every 5 years. In Missouri, we require the additional step of becoming a Licensed Dietitian, which allows for a system of reporting those who provide false and harmful nutrition information under the label \"dietitian.\"Other nutrition professionals have a variety of educational backgrounds and experience providing nutrition education. One real-life example was from 2012 in my first job as a dietitian. A patient in the hospital where I worked told me that a person claiming to be a \"dietitian\" at her nursing home told the patient that her doctor should change how much warfarin (a blood thinning medication) she took every day based on how much vitamin K the patient ate. This is an extremely unrealistic, not to mention dangerous, expectation; a Registered Dietitian Nutritionist would have known better. I educated the patient about the danger of this recommendation, and why eating the same amount of vitamin K every day was very important to allow her doctor to give her the right amount of the medication. This is just the tip of the iceberg. The stories I hear about so-called \"Dietitians\" and \"Nutritionists\" often make me shake my head in dismay. In contrast, the ethical responsibility of Registered Dietitian Nutritionists compels us to provide information that is accurate, scientific, and free from commercial bias. Recently I discovered the logo of a major insulin company on handouts that were considered \"standard\" to provide to the patients in our diabetes program. I brought this to the attention of my supervisor (also a Registered Dietitian Nutritionist), and we are in the process of changing those handouts (and sometimes creating new handouts) so we may provide non-branded information to the participants. As a Registered Dietitian Nutritionist, I am deeply concerned about the health and well-being of the people of Missouri if this bill is passed. Allowing anyone to provide nutrition advice allows for those with little training, and often those who are looking to sell something, to take advantage of others. This bill would eliminate consequences for those who provide information without the appropriate training. I implore you to oppose this bill and ensure the safety and well-being of your constituents.WITNESS APPEARANCE NUMBER: DATE: 2/24/2021 COMMITTEE: Professional Registration and Licensing FOR INFORMATIONAL PURPOSES IN OPPOSITION TO IN SUPPORT OF TESTIFYING: WITNESS THIS FORM IS PUBLIC RECORD UNDER CHAPTER 610, RSMo. My name is Madeline Puto and I am a Dietetic Intern and Master's of Science in Medical Dietetics Student at Saint Louis University. I am writing to express my opposition to HB 475. Supporting this bill is dangerous and irresponsible to the people of Missouri. As a Dietetic Intern, I have completed my bachelors degree in Nutrition and Dietetics and I am currently in a rigorous program to gain experience with dietitians across Saint Louis. I am taking the time to educate myself on the nutrition care process and using evidence based practice to treat my patients and clients under the direction of a dietitian. Working in a variety of settings as an intern has allowed me to see how a dietitian can help manage an individuals medical conditions and lead to an overall better quality of life. I have also been able to see the life threatening consequences of patients who have been given false nutrition information. Both sides of this bill believe that our food choices can help or harm us, but only a Registered Dietitian is trained in using science and evidence based practice. When clients are ready to make changes about their health, they should be confident that they are given an accurate assessment and counseling session. An individual who has done research online or taken a 3-week certification course does not have the expertise to provide accurate, evidence based Nutrition Therapy. You would not trust a random individual to preform surgery on you, so why would you trust an unlicensed individual with your Nutrition Therapy needs? Choosing to support this bill is choosing to fail the people of Missouri. It is of the utmost importance that you vote to oppose this bill.

As a current dietetic student, who will be graduating in 9 weeks with my bachelor's degree, I am writing to you today to oppose Bill 475. I, personally, have put in years of effort, time, and dedication to take classes such as organic chemistry, biochemistry, and medical nutrition therapy to gain knowledge of the science behind how nutrition affects the body. After graduation, I will begin my 7-month internship completing nutrition assessments, under a qualified, dietitian preceptor, in the clinical and community rotation setting. This supervised practice will further expand my knowledge to provide excellent, evidence-based practice. Again, I ask that you oppose Bill 475 to only allow credentialed Registered Dietitians Nutritionists to practice individualized nutrition assessments to protect the overall health and well-being of Missouri residents.

As a dietitian, I have undergone years of training to be sure that I am qualified and capable of doing my assigned job. I undergo licensure and registration, and every dietitian's degree program is specifically evaluated and accredited to make sure we are learning what we need to learn. We have a code of ethics in place and a system to track and address violations. This is so the public and the places that employ RDs can be assured that we will help, and not harm. And for the protection of the public, if a dietitian does practice out of scope, or cause harm - it is easy to report and have us held accountable. Without such a coordinated system in place, how can the public be protected? I have seen in my job how people can be harmed by unethical scams put out by malicous practitioners. But, I have also seen harm done by those who genuinely thought they were providing appropriate advice, but sadly due to lack of training caused problems instead. Nutrition is complex, and it requires a deeper understanding of the human mind and body than many programs or certificates are able to provide. People deserve the expertise of a qualified practitioner when seeking nutritional counsel - a Registered Dietitian. Underming the protections of licensure and required qualifications will hurt Missourians.WITNESS APPEARANCE REPRESENTATIVES HB 475BILL NUMBER: DATE: 2/24/2021 COMMITTEE: Professional Registration and Licensing FOR INFORMATIONAL PURPOSES IN OPPOSITION TO IN SUPPORT OF TESTIFYING: WITNESS NAME THIS FORM IS PUBLIC RECORD UNDER CHAPTER 610, RSMo. Mr Grier-As a constituent of your district- Chesterfield, MO 63017 - and an active Health Care provider: Registered Licensed Dietitian Nutritionist for the past 30 years at Washington University School of Medicine and St. Louis Children's Hospital- please consider what this bill does to the medical care of individuals in Missouri. Personally I have worked at the local, state, and national level of the Academy of Nutrition and Dietetics. Please understand and know that Registered Dietitian Nutritionists have a 4 year bachelors degree in science, a year long internship and a vast majority of us have Masters degrees to make sure we are providing science and research based medical nutrition therapy to our patients and sound scientific advice in the community settings as well. The proposed changes would eliminate protections for the health and wellbeing of the public by letting unqualified practitioners provide nutrition assessments to patients with nutrition-related diseases and medical conditions, thereby undermining the current licensure law. Consumers need safe, reliable and evidence-based practices appropriate for their individual needs, diseases, health conditions and complex dietary requirements. I oppose this bill because I want to ensure Missourians are protected from unqualified practitioners and unintended consequences associated with eliminating key protections in our state.

I urge you to vote NO on HB 475. This would give individuals without sufficient formal training in nutrition science the ability to conduct nutrition assessments, which could potentially harm Missourians. Nutrition assessment is much more than simply hearing a client's goals, food likes & dislikes, and then making recommendations. Nutrition assessment is defined not only in the Scope of Practice for the current licensure bill, but also in the formalized Nutrition Care Process. Healthcare professionals need to stay within their respective scope of practice for their profession. Thank you for your consideration.WITNESS APPEARANCE FORMMISSOURI HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES HB 475BILL NUMBER: DATE: 2/24/2021 COMMITTEE: Professional Registration and Licensing FOR INFORMATIONAL PURPOSES IN OPPOSITION TO IN SUPPORT OF TESTIFYING: WITNESS NAME THIS FORM IS PUBLIC RECORD UNDER CHAPTER 610, RSMo. Dear Committee, I am opposed to HB 475. By definition, nutrition therapy administration is provided as medical treatment for a specific condition and should require a board certified education by a recognized accredited body and a state license, just like occupational therapy, physical therapy, speech therapy, or licensed nursing. The language in this bill will allow for anyone with nutrition education to render medical nutrition therapy. I can obtain nutrition education for my dog. That does not make him qualified to provide nutrition education.This bill does not certify who is qualified and who is not qualified to provide medical nutrition therapy or why. It would allow many well-meaning people with no medical training or accredited certifications to give individualized meal planning guidelines without assuring training to assess for dangers and co-morbid conditions. Medical nutrition therapy is just that... a medical intervention related to food and nutrition.This is not about health coaching. This does not keep educated nutritionists from teaching people about standardized nutrition information (use of my plate or using a food label). The current legislation does not keep good nutrition from people who need it. It does not prevent any trained and licensed registered dietitians/nutritionists from offering training to improve public health. The current legislation DOES protect the public interest from third parties that may use nutrition education to support pseudo-science, unproven treatments, and non-regulated supplements. I am concerned that this bill, though written with good intentions, would let these charlatans run amuck.WITNESS APPEARANCE FORMMISSOURI HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES HB 475BILL NUMBER: DATE: 2/24/2021 COMMITTEE: Professional Registration and Licensing FOR INFORMATIONAL PURPOSES IN OPPOSITION TO IN SUPPORT OF TESTIFYING: WITNESS NAME INDIVIDUAL: WITNESS THIS FORM IS PUBLIC RECORD UNDER CHAPTER 610, RSMo. As a lifelong Missouri resident, a registered dietitian nutritionist with 40 years experience, and an educator of future dietitians, I strongly oppose the changes proposed in HB 475 relating to the Licensure of Dietitians.In order to be eligible for credentialing, our Registered Dietitian Nutritionist (RDN) students must successfully complete a rigorous educational curriculum that includes human biology, organic chemistry, and biochemistry. They also learn, in detail, the pathophysiology of various disease states such as diabetes, cardiovascular disease, renal disease and their nutritional implications. At a minimum, RDN students earn a 4-year undergraduate degree which, beginning in 2024, will be upgraded to a master's degree requirement. Finally, they complete at least 1200 hours of supervised practice (internship) that involves hands-on practice in the field. I might also add that although many students are interested in dietetics and nutrition, due to the challenging curriculum requirements, many have had to choose other paths.Due to their extensive education and hands-on experiential learning, RDNs are highly trained and qualified practitioners and should be the only professionals providing medical nutrition therapy, or MNT. Our nutrition care process begins with a thorough assessment of an individual's medical, social, and dietary history which lays the groundwork for a nutrition diagnosis and an individualized nutrition care plan. Without the proper training and educational background, key components of that plan could be missed or overlooked which could have concerning and dangerous effects on a patient's health outcome. For example, without proper educational training an individual may not be aware of how to implement the latest recommendations for cardiovascular disease, or recommend a dietary change that is not evidence based or is contradictory to their medical condition. Missouri's Dietitian Practice Act (Chapter 324.200-324.225 RSMo) was enacted in 1998 to protect the public from demonstrated harm and to recognize the education standards needed to provide vital health care services to the public. It has been working effectively for more than twenty years. The proposed exemption in HB 475 would swallow the rule, eliminating key protections for Missourians seeking to treat or manage diseases and other medical conditions. Please don't take Missouri back two decades and undo the good work that has been done.It is important to note that the current law does not prevent anyone from \"talk[ing] with individual clients about healthy eating and nutrition\" and unless unlicensed individuals are seeking to provide individualized counseling to treat or manage patients and clients with diseases or medical conditions, they will continue to be exempt from the current licensing law. Thus any change to the law is unnecessary.In conclusion, I strongly urge you to oppose the changes to HB 475 and keep Missouri's Dietitian Practice Act intact to only allow properly trained and credentialed Registered Dietitian Nutritionists to practice individualized nutrition assessment. This will assure that all Missourians receive safe and quality nutrition care for a variety of health conditions now and into the future.Sincerely,Mary Beth Ohlms, MEd, RDN, LDAssistant Professor DATE: 2/24/2021 COMMITTEE: Professional Registration and Licensing FOR INFORMATIONAL PURPOSES IN OPPOSITION TO IN SUPPORT OF TESTIFYING: WITNESS NAME THIS FORM IS PUBLIC RECORD UNDER CHAPTER 610, RSMo. Dear Representatives:This letter is to express my opposition to the HB 475 which would allow persons without defined qualifications to perform nutrition assessments and to provide nutrition advice and encouragement to the public as long as they do not call themselves dietitians. My concern is that this bill would expose persons who have serious, complicated medical conditions to misinformation which could potentially cause harm. Dietitians are required to obtain a 4 year degree followed by a rigorous internship covering all areas of dietetics. Because medical and nutritional science is continually advancing, dietitians are required to obtain 75 hours of continuing education to maintain licensure. Some dietitians such as myself, obtain specialized certifications in areas such as nutrition support, renal disease, or diabetes care. All of these specializations require difficult exams. My understanding of the role of a health coach is to provide encouragement for the client in identifying and achieving their health goals. This is an important role. However, when considering persons with any type of medical condition, the nutrition assessment of these persons and the provision of accurate information for the person's specific condition should be performed by persons who have the training to do this and have evidence of this training. I would encourage you not to pass this bill.

To become a Registered Dietitian you are required to obtain a 4 year bachelors degree as well as complete a 9 month internship which requires 1200 hours of supervised practice. If you take away a state licensure then ANYONE in the State of Missouri can call themselves a Dietitian even if they don't have the 1200 hours of supervised practice OR the education that is required. Nutrition counseling and nutrition medical orders takes intense training and education especially when you are dealing with a complex situation in regards to a patients life outcome.

Good morning. I am currently a Dietetic Intern living and studying in St. Louis, and am writing to express my concern and opposition regarding HB475. I returned to school to receive a second bachelor's degree in Dietetics due to the extensive criteria the degree and the field require. My continued education required additional studies in the sciences including anatomy and physiology, microbiology, chemistry, biochemistry, and food science. Other courses like advanced nutrition and medical nutrition therapy helped further my knowledge and deepen my understanding with food and the body. Included in this education, I have been highly trained throughout a hands-on internship in conducting nutrition assessments to look at all aspects of the client or patient. This includes their labs and blood work, current medications and how food may interact with those medications, conversations with clients to determine their food habits, including any cultural aspects, and physiological needs to determine behavior changes. This assessment is determined in the dietitian's Scope of Practice and is distinguished within the Nutrition Care Process to be accurate throughout the healthcare system. With respect to health coaches and those certified in nutrition, this advanced assessment education is not included in their certification courses. It would potentially be very harmful to patients to allow someone without this level of education to conduct assessments and provide nutrition support from a medical standpoint. For example, I have worked with cancer patients who heard from a health coach that eating Vegan is the only way to \"cure\" themselves, only to end up not eating and losing too much weight to successfully navigate their treatment. My own mother has dealt with diabetes and heart issues, and was instructed by a nutrition coach to take supplements and cut out major food groups, only worsening her health until working with a dietitian. This group has also suggested that dietitians hold a monopoly over the state of Missouri. As these health coaches are still able to provide general health and wellness education in regards to the existing nutritional dietary guidelines, this statement is absurd. I encourage you to vote NO in opposition of HB475 to allow dietitians to hold their licensure for the overall health and safety of Missouri citizens. Thank you for your time.WITNESS APPEARANCE FORMMISSOURI HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES HB 475BILL NUMBER: DATE: 2/24/2021 COMMITTEE: Professional Registration and Licensing FOR INFORMATIONAL PURPOSES IN OPPOSITION TO IN SUPPORT OF TESTIFYING: WITNESS NAME THIS FORM IS PUBLIC RECORD UNDER CHAPTER 610, RSMo.

As a Registered Dietitian, I oppose HB 475. The law, as it currently stands, does not prevent anyone from \"talking with individual clients about healthy eating and nutrition\" and unless unlicensed individuals are seeking to provide individualized counseling to treat or manage patients and clients with diseases or medical conditions, they will continue to be exempt from the current licensing law. What the current law stands to do is to protect the health and safety of the public from receiving individualized nutrition information from unqualified sources. As a healthcare provider, I have seen the damage that can occur from untrained \"nutrition professionals\" providing individualized information to members of the public without proper understanding of disease states and human physiology. I do not believe that all \"nutrition professionals\" that are not registered dietitians are unqualified to be providing nutrition information, but it is our job to protect the health and safety of the public. HB 475 would allow anyone without any training or background to provide complex medical nutrition therapies to patients with nutrition-related diseases and medical conditions. For this reason, I urge you to oppose HB 475- not because we, registered dietitians, want to limit access to nutrition information, but because we want to protect the health and safety of the Missouri people.

If I agreed to pass this bill, then, the field of dietetics and receiving a degree in dietetics would be at risk of disappearing. Registered dietitians did not spend a large sum of money and most of their life getting educated, to only receive a low-income wage and for their job to be taken by individuals who didn't receive any education in evidence-based nutritional information. Missouri is in DESPERATE NEED of well-educated and credentialed nutrition practitioners that use evidence-based knowledge to treat their patients/clients. Thomas Edison once proclaimed that \"The doctor of the future will no longer treat the human frame with drugs, but rather will cure and prevent disease with nutrition.\" Allowing for non-educated individuals to practice as a \"nutritionist\" could cause more harm than good to people in need of nutritional help.WITNESS APPEARANCE FORMMISSOURI HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES HB 475BILL NUMBER: DATE: 2/24/2021 COMMITTEE: Professional Registration and Licensing FOR INFORMATIONAL PURPOSES IN OPPOSITION TO IN SUPPORT OF TESTIFYING: WITNESS NAME INDIVIDUAL: THIS FORM IS PUBLIC RECORD UNDER CHAPTER 610, RSMo. Hello, my name is Molly Diehl and I am a licensed and registered dietitian practicing in Saint Louis, MO. I often have patients admitted to the hospital with uncontrolled diabetes which as we know can lead to strokes, neuropathy, kidney failure, poor vascular system, and so much more. When my patients take the advice from just anybody who is not a licensed dietitian they run the risk with re-admissions to the hospital and the potential for life altering events to occur. For example, I had a patient in the last week who was told to drink boost plus oral protein shakes to gain weight as he had lost approximately 50 lbs and wanted to gain that weight back. The patient however was admitted with elevated blood sugars causing him to be on insulin. If this patient had asked a licensed dietitian how he should have appropriately gained weight we would of looked at his blood sugars numbers, appropriately spacing out shake and meal times, and discussed what supplements and their carbohydrate amounts would be appropriate in their diet.Unfortunately some of the most inaccurate information for my patient's comes from gym trainers, chiropractors, or self proclaimed \"nutritionist\". I have experienced on numerous occasions my patients coming in with inaccurate or harmful nutritional advice. The most current trend of following a \"ketogenic\" diet has lead one of my patients with new elevated cholesterol levels and starting medication. Another one of my patients was told to try pink Himalayan salt when they had been diagnosed with heart failure. A licensed dietitian would tell you that any type of salt contains sodium chloride which would cause fluid to accumulate around the heart and therefore cause your heart to work harder causing fluid overload and at minimum a trip to the hospital. There are many reasons that dietitians must have a bachelors in science and 1,200 hours of supervised practice under a dietitian but these are just a few of them.WITNESS APPEARANCE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES HB 475BILL NUMBER: DATE: 2/24/2021 COMMITTEE: Professional Registration and Licensing FOR INFORMATIONAL PURPOSES IN OPPOSITION TO IN SUPPORT OF TESTIFYING: WITNESS NAME THIS FORM IS PUBLIC RECORD UNDER CHAPTER 610, RSMo.

Dear Representatives, Bill HB 475 is a frightening one to my profession as a Registered Dietitian. As a registered dietitian one must earn a Bachelors of science, fulfill an internship of 1200 practice hours, and sit for a registration exam. This is not enough to protect the profession and the individual. When I was granted licensure in the state of Missouri this protected my designation as a nutrition expert in my field. I worry that if licensure gets taken away, other professionals designating themselves as a \"nutrition expert\" could potentially harm the individual they are \"treating\". As a dietitian with years or education and experience, I know the harm that could come from taking away licensure and allowing anyone to act as a \"nutrition expert\".

Dear members of the committee, As your constituent and a Registered Dietitian Nutritionist, I strongly oppose the changes proposed in HB 475 relating to the Licensure of Dietitians.Registered Dietitians are uniquely qualified to deliver evidence-based, individualized nutrition education. Our education and training involves study including organic chemistry, food chemistry, biochemistry, biology and physiology as a foundation to our knowledge of nutrition and skills to maintain current knowledge and practice in the quickly evolving field of nutrition science. In addition to this, dietitians are required to complete a comprehensive supervised internship. This combination of didactic and practical training makes us uniquely qualified to deliver evidence based, individualized nutrition education in the context of not only someone's medical and physical needs, but also their socioeconomic status, cultural practices and individual preferences. Through the COVID 19 pandemic, dietetic professionals have risen to the occasion and provided telehealth to counsel our patients and individuals with nutrition- related medical needs while keeping them safe, and providing the ability to reach more people in rural areas for counseling via telehealth more than ever before.The Missouri's Dietitian Practice Act (Chapter 324.200-324.225 RSMo) was put in place to protect Missourian's and recognize the education standards that are necessary to ensure that individuals are being provided with appropriate nutrition advice to treat and mange disease and other medical conditions. The law does not prevent anyone from talking with individuals about healthy eating and nutrition, unless the unlicensed individuals are providing individualized counseling to treat or manage patients and clients with disease or medical conditions. The law has and continues to do what it was intended to do: ensure that individuals with nutrition related disease or nutrition managed medical conditions, people that are some of our most vulnerable population, are protected from the possibility of misinformation from anyone without training or background to provide complex medical nutrition therapy to these individuals. The proposed exemption in HB 475 would eliminate that protection. I urge you to vote No in opposition to HB 475.

Missouri's Dietitian Practice Act (Chapter 324.200-324.225 RSMo) was enacted in 1998 to protect the public from demonstrated harm and to recognize the education standards needed to provide vital health care services to the public and it has worked effectively for more than twenty years. The proposed exemption in SB 232 would swallow the rule, eliminating key protections for Missourians seeking to treat or manage diseases and other medical conditions.As a registered licensed dietitian I strongly oppose this bill.WITNESS HB 475BILL NUMBER: DATE: 2/24/2021 COMMITTEE: Professional Registration and Licensing FOR INFORMATIONAL PURPOSES IN OPPOSITION TO IN SUPPORT OF TESTIFYING: WITNESS NAME THIS FORM IS PUBLIC RECORD UNDER CHAPTER 610, RSMo. There are several issues inherent to the discription of the bill: \"free literature or provide individualized nutrition assessment, guidance, encouragement, recommendations, or weight control services as to the use of food, food materials or dietary supplements without a dietitian license, as long as the person does not hold himself or herself out as a dietitian.\" In particular, medical nutrition is a field that requires specific education (verified by licensure) to appropriately be able to perform any of the noted action. \"Free literature\" does not guarantee peer-reviewed literature in reputable journals, nutritional assessment is an impossibility without a complete understanding of both macro- and micro-nutrient deficiencies or excess (and complications/medical conditions contributing to or caused by them), guidance/encouragement/recommendations are impossible tasks without proper education and training in this area, and \"weight control services\" is just asking for dangerous quackery in the form of inappropriate management of potentially severe underlying conditions. To offer all of these abilities just as long as a person doesn't call themselves a \"dietitian\" is ripe for abuse - while Missouri also protects the term \"nutritionist,\" there is nothing to stop an individual from using a similar, misleading label (e.g. \"nutrition counselor/consultant\") that will ultimately confuse the public into thinking that they have licensure that they do not have. This is well-intentioned work that ultimately hurts the general public, in a US state that already has some of the most morbid health and nutrition in the nation.

I am writing today in opposition of HB 475. As a registered and licensed dietitian in the State of Missouri, I practice daily to ensure patients receive accurate science-based nutrition counseling to treat many health conditions. The education required to be a registered dietitian includes 4 years of undergraduate schooling, a nine month internship, and 75 hours of continuing education every 5 years to stay up-to-date on emerging nutrition science. HB 475 would allow any person to provide individualized nutrition assessment to treat any type of medical condition. It is simply unethical to allow an individual who possibly received their training through internet research to assess patients and provide medical nutrition therapy. The health effects on Missouri residents could be detrimental.

I am a registered dietitian and certified personal trainer, pursuing my master's in sports nutrition, for a local private practice. I am strongly opposed to HB 475. In fact, I am disappointed and extremely concerned that this legislature is being threatened on my profession. As a 23 year-old, I am in my 6th year of devoting my education to all that is nutrition, and I still have much to learn. I am confident that a certification (some of which are not from accredited organizations) will not provide an individual with the knowledge base to assess nutrition status and treat disease with nutrition. In fact, while reading through some of the statements in support of HB 475, I saw one example of nutrition advice that was recommended by non-dietitians, that goes against our evidence-based practice. As a professional who possesses a degree in dietetics, has completed a 1200 hour supervised internship, and sat for a 3 hour board certification exam to become a dietitian, while also possessing a certification obtained through 2 months of studying with a 3 hour exam to become a trainer, I am aware of the differences in the depth of knowledge between the two. If licensure laws did not exist for physicians, would you truly prefer someone who obtained a certification requiring only a handful of months to assess, treat, and prescribe medications for a chronic disease over a physician who holds a 4 year bachelor's, 4 years of medical school, 4 years of residency, and potentially 4 years of fellowship under their belt? There are no certifications that allow someone to practice alternatives to occupational therapy, speech language pathology, or nursing practice. These professions are part of my interdisciplinary care team. Why does my profession offer those without the background that my other colleagues and I an opportunity to practice the same way that I do? Did you know that by 2024, all new dietitians will be required to obtain a master's level education to practice? Why are our requirements to practice becoming stricter, but the legislature to provide nutrition care might become more lenient? The reason for my statement is not for selfish reasons or to solely protect my career. The reason for my statement is to protect my clients. I have seen many clients and acquaintances with disordered eating patterns, unnecessary food avoidances or intolerances, diagnoses of \"diseases\" affecting nutrition that are not supported by the healthcare community, hundreds and thousands of dollars spent on irrelevant supplements and cleanses that have worsened conditions, and those who have extreme stress and anxiety around eating, some of which were induced by those holding only nutrition certifications. It takes so much more than just a basic level of nutrition understanding that is offered through certification programs. It takes a licensed professional who is held to a code of ethics, one who understands pathophysiology of disease, and one who is trained and educated the way dietitians are. Dietitians are the gold standard in providing nutrition therapy. My passion is health and fitness, just as everyone else who has submitted testimonies in support of HB 475, but I chose to devote the past 6 years of my educational career, with more to come, to earn my place to assess clients and provide the gold standard of medical nutrition therapy. Thank you for your time.WITNESS APPEARANCE FORMMISSOURI HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES HB 475BILL NUMBER: DATE: 2/24/2021 COMMITTEE: Professional Registration and Licensing FOR INFORMATIONAL PURPOSES IN OPPOSITION TO IN SUPPORT OF TESTIFYING: WITNESS NAME THIS FORM IS PUBLIC RECORD UNDER CHAPTER 610, RSMo. February 23, 2021To Whom it May Concern:As a Missouri board certified General Pediatrician who is also board certified in Obesity Medicine, I am writing in strong opposition to HB 475. On a daily basis, I see children and teens with the disease of obesity who struggle to find reputable nutrition guidance. The epidemic of pediatric obesity will not be solved quickly and demands a multidisciplinary approach. Primary care providers must work hand in hand with other health professionals, including registered dietitian nutritionists (RDNs) to provide evidence-based care. Patients with obesity and their parents are often confused by the myriad marketing that they've seen and heard about what foods and drinks are healthy. They greatly benefit from the guidance of the pediatric RDNs on our team, who have the training and credentials to be authorities in this area. RDNs are uniquely qualified to provide intensive medical nutrition therapy.Children and teens with severe obesity and complications of their excess weight also need assessment of their blood pressure and lab values by a RDN in order to give specific medical nutrition therapy that can result in improvement or resolution of these complications. RDNs are uniquely qualified to prescribe and monitor these medical nutrition therapies and their outcomes. More and more children and teens with obesity are also on medication to address complications of their weight, and a RDN has critical knowledge of how other treatment, including use of nutritional supplements, may interact with these medications. In summary, RDNs, who undergo extensive training and credentialing, are uniquely qualified to provide medical nutrition therapy for not only obesity but other chronic diseases affecting children and adults. They are an essential part of the recommended multidisciplinary healthcare team and provide accurate and safe guidance that leads to health improvement.Sincerely, Sarah Hampl, MD, FAAPDiplomate, American Board of Obesity HB 475BILL NUMBER: DATE: 2/24/2021 COMMITTEE: Professional Registration and Licensing FOR INFORMATIONAL PURPOSES IN OPPOSITION TO IN SUPPORT OF TESTIFYING: WITNESS NAME INDIVIDUAL: THIS FORM IS PUBLIC RECORD UNDER CHAPTER 610, RSMo. I am opposed to HB 475. By definition, the provision of nutrition therapy is provided as a medical treatment for a specific condition and should require a board certified education by a recognized accredited body and a state license, just like occupational therapy, physical therapy, speech therapy, or licensed nursing. The language in this bill will allow for anyone with nutrition education to render medical nutrition therapy. It does not certify who is qualified and who is not qualified or why. It would allow many well-meaning people with no medical training or accredited certifications to give individualized meal planning guidelines without assuring training to assess for dangers and co-morbid conditions. Medical nutrition therapy is just that... a medical intervention related to food and nutrition. This is not about health coaching. This does not keep educated nutritionists from teaching people about standardized nutrition information (use of my plate or using a food label). The current legislation does not keep good nutrition from people who need it. It does not prevent passionate, trained and licensed registered dietitians/nutritionists from offering training to improve public health. The current legislation does protect the public interest from third parties that may use nutrition education to support pseudo-science, unproven treatments, and non-regulated supplements. I am concerned that this bill, though written with good intentions, would open up Missourians to just that.WITNESS APPEARANCE NUMBER: DATE: 2/24/2021 COMMITTEE: Professional Registration and Licensing FOR INFORMATIONAL PURPOSES IN OPPOSITION TO IN SUPPORT OF TESTIFYING: WITNESS NAME INDIVIDUAL: THIS FORM IS PUBLIC RECORD UNDER CHAPTER 610, RSMo. I am writing in opposition to HB475. This bill is not in the best interest of the people of Missouri. Allowing someone who is not a registered, licensed dietitian to provide \"individualized nutrition assessment, recommendations, guidance\" as the bill states is putting those individuals at risk. The standards and requirements for becoming a registered and licensed dietitian (which include a 4 year degree with rigorous courses in science, advanced metabolism, medical nutrition therapy, nutrition counseling, etc. + soon to be a master's requirement, along with 1200 hours of supervised practice and sitting for a national exam) are in place for good reason and people who do not meet those qualifications should not be allowed to perform individual nutrition assessments. A nutrition assessment performed by a registered, licensed dietitian includes a full assessment of the patient's medical history, considering nutrient-drug interactions, evaluating lab values, physical exam & looking for signs of nutrient deficiencies, malnutrition, and more. Then the dietitian assesses the patient's nutrition needs, diagnoses nutrition problems and causes based on the above factors and makes recommendations to the patient accordingly. As another dietitian stated in these testimonies, there is a difference in providing nutrition education/general nutrition information vs. providing nutrition assessment and individual recommendations for a patient/client. There are existing health professionals and nutrition professionals providing nutrition education or information to the public in various capacities - but that is different than someone unlicensed providing a one on one assessment and recommendations when they do not have credentials and experience in medical nutrition therapy. There are licensed dietitians available in a wide variety of areas and practice settings- there are dietitians in grocery stores, in doctor's offices, schools, hospitals, nursing facilities, corporate wellness, sports nutrition, etc. Licensure for dietitians needs to be protected in Missouri so that we can continue to serve and care for people in Missouri.I would urge you to oppose HB475 and changes to the dietitian practice act in the interest of the people of Missouri.

As a Registered Dietitian and member of the Heart Transplant team at Barnes Jewish Hospital, my responsibility is to provide evidence-based care and individualized medical nutrition therapy (MNT) to every patient. I care for several heart failure patients of whom, have commodities (i.e. diabetes, hepatitis, chronic kidney disease, etc.) to take into consideration when providing specific nutrition education to my patients. The proposed changes outlined in HB 475 would undermine the current licensure law and role of Registered Dietitians. For reference, RDs are required to complete a Bachelor's degree granted from a US accredited college/university, completion of Accreditation Council for Education in Nutrition and Dietetics (ACEND) accredited Didactic Program in Dietetics, completion of ACEND Dietetic Internship (minimum 1200 hours of unpaid field work), complete a Master's degree (required 2024), pass the Commission of Dietetic Registration Exam, obtain state licensure, and maintenance of credentials through continuing education (minimum 75 credits per 5 year period). From my experience in practice, I have received several enquires related to \"fad diets\", such as the ketogenic diet, as means to improve health and/or lose weight. The ketogenic diet is therapeutically recommended for children with epilepsy. I have cared for several patients where the ketogenic diet has been wrongfully implemented. Given that this diet emphasizes the intake of foods that tend to be high in saturated fat and cholesterol, and advises the restriction of carbohydrates (including whole grains and fruits), this directly contraindicates many of the nutrition recommendations I, as a healthcare professional, provide in the hospital. Heart failure and other medical conditions may be exacerbated as a result of this misinformation. Fortunately, many of these patients have been able to receive a heart transplant or other advanced therapies but other patients are not as lucky.It is my due diligence to advocate for my patient's health and safety by allowing access to evidenced-based care and bringing to light the copious sources of misinformation at the hands of those who are ill-equipped to handle such responsibilities.

I have read the supporting testimonies for bill HB 475 and have a lot of concerns for the people of Missouri. Registered dietitians (RD) are trained as many other healthcare professionals - requiring a bachelor of science degree, completing 1000 supervised practice hours, passing a national credentialing exam, and maintaining 75 hours of continuing education every 5 years. Other individuals who claim to be a \"nutrition professional\" but do not have the RD credential do not have the same educational standards and therefore are ill-equipped to provide the same kind of care. Additionally, the training often received by these individuals are not science or evidenced-based and therefore not recommended to improve health. It is concerning to allow individuals who have a small knowledge of nutrition, providing nutrition therapy to individuals in order to \"improve health\". This will provide a false sense of security for the public who is seeking the advice from people who are not adequately trained in scientific evidence-based nutrition information. In addition, allowing individuals to provide nutrition therapy who are not properly trained to do so can cause harm to one's overall health. Please consider the long-term effects this may have on the health of the state if this bill passes.

My name is Selena Saulsbery, and a current Graduate Dietitian with the Department of Veteran Affairs. I am writing as a constituent and a future dietitian waiting to take my licensure exam with the hope that you will vote against House Bill #475. It is a bill proposed by Representative Derek Grier which allows non-Registered Dietitians to give nutrition assessments to patients. Currently Registered Dietitians complete nutrition assessments which promotes individualized, specialized care to patients by using evidence-based nutrition information. The passage of this bill poses a great threat to consumer health by allowing untrained individuals the ability to give health information that can be harmful and misleading to the patient. The need for appropriate nutrition assessments by a trained and educated professional is critical. I will soon take my exam to become a Registered Dietitian and have worked very hard to provide the upmost care to the Veterans who have served our country. It was my time as an intern and now employee with the VA that I have been able to visit with many Veterans who experience health conditions that warrant nutrition interventions. One Vietnam era Veteran who experienced a stroke and lost his ability to safely swallow foods. Interventions required the need for tube feeding and day to day observations of his tolerance of the feedings, lab work, and any side effects that could occur including dehydration, diarrhea, and vomiting. This patient was closely monitored by myself as an intern and a Registered Dietitian to ensure his nutrition needs were being met. I currently work closely with another Veteran who is diagnosed with malnutrition amongst many other chronic illnesses. It is through a careful lens and nutrition assessment skill that I am able to continually monitor his nutritional status in order to best support him. Registered Dietitians must obtain a Bachelor of Science degree, 1200 hours of supervised practice, and pass a licensure exam in order to become a practicing Registered Dietitian. Registered Dietitians are also required to obtain continuing education units in order to stay up to date with the latest evidence-based information in the field. Allowing non-trained professionals, the ability to provide nutrition assessments undermines the dietetics field and puts the consumer in harm's way which in turn increases the health care costs for both the patient and State. Please strongly consider voting against House Bill #475. Thank you for your consideration.

Oppose HB 475/SB 232 Message: As your constituent, I strongly oppose the changes proposed in HB 475 relating to the Licensure of Dietitians. Missouri's Dietitian Practice Act (Chapter 324.200-324.225 RSMo) was enacted in 1998 to protect the public from demonstrated harm and to recognize the education standards needed to provide vital health care services to the public and it has worked effectively for more than twenty years. The proposed exemption in HB 475 would swallow the rule, eliminating key protections for Missourians seeking to treat or manage diseases and other medical conditions. To be clear, the current law does not prevent anyone from \"talk[ing] with individual clients about healthy eating and nutrition\" and unless unlicensed individuals are seeking to provide individualized counseling to treat or manage patients and clients with diseases or medical conditions, they will continue to be exempt from the current licensing law. To underscore this fact, the Division of Professional Registration - State Committee of Dietitians reports that there have been no complaints about someone providing the nutrition information or advice proponents assert they are unable to provide and thus the Committee has had no reason to discipline or sanction these unlicensed providers. In short, the Dietitian Practice Act is working as intended. Despite these facts (and our national organization's ongoing efforts to collaborate with proponents to clarify misunderstandings of the law here in Missouri and elsewhere), HB 475 offers a dangerously disproportionate solution in search of a merely hypothetical problem; it would newly allow anyone without any training or background to provide complex medical nutrition therapies to patients with nutrition-related diseases and medical conditions. I urge you to oppose HB 475 to avoid grave unintended consequences of eliminating these critical, effective, and narrowly tailored consumer protections.WITNESS APPEARANCE FORMMISSOURI HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES HB 475BILL NUMBER: DATE: 2/24/2021 COMMITTEE: Professional Registration and Licensing FOR INFORMATIONAL PURPOSES IN OPPOSITION TO IN SUPPORT OF TESTIFYING: WITNESS NAME INFORMATION ON THIS FORM IS PUBLIC RECORD UNDER CHAPTER 610, RSMo.

The purpose of the Missouri's Dietitian Practice Act (Chapter 324.200-324.225 RSMo), 1998 is to protect the public from harm and to acknowledge the education needed to provide important health care services to the public. We are seeing success since enacting more than twenty years ago. The proposed exemption in HB 475 would negate the rule, removing key protections for Missourians seeking to treat or manage diseases and other medical conditions.Currently, the law does not prevent anyone from discussing with individual clients about healthy eating and nutrition and unless unlicensed individuals are promoting/consulting for individualized counseling to treat or manage patients and clients with diseases or medical conditions, these individuals will continue to be exempt from the current licensing law. The Division of Professional Registration - State Committee of Dietitians reports no complaints about someone providing the nutrition information or advice proponents assert they are unable to provide and thus the Committee has had no reason to discipline or sanction these unlicensed providers. The Dietitian Practice Act is working as envisioned. Despite these facts (and our national organization's ongoing efforts to collaborate with proponents to clarify misunderstandings of the law here in Missouri and elsewhere), HB 475 does not offer these same protections and no testimony as to why it would change. HB 475 would endanger the health and wellbeing of Missourians seeking support for complex medical nutrition therapies with nutrition-related diseases and medical conditions by allowing anyone without any training or background to provide care. I urge you to oppose HB 475 to avoid grave unintended consequences of eliminating these critical, effective, and narrowly tailored consumer protections.WITNESS APPEARANCE FORMMISSOURI HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES HB 475BILL NUMBER: DATE: 2/24/2021 COMMITTEE: Professional Registration and Licensing FOR INFORMATIONAL PURPOSES IN OPPOSITION TO IN SUPPORT OF TESTIFYING: WITNESS NAME THIS FORM IS PUBLIC RECORD UNDER CHAPTER 610, RSMo. Dear Committee Members: I am submitting this testimony in opposition to House Bill 475. It seems much misinformation is being reported that suggests nutrition practitioners are unable to work at their scope of practice and see individual clients in the state of Missouri and HB 475 would change that. This is in fact, false. HB 475 instead would allow any person to \"provide individualized nutrition assessment\". The implications of allowing those without a license and without the proper education to do nutritional assessments would be detrimental to public health and remove protections in case of harm.As you know, a licensure act defines a scope of practice and providing nutrition assessment is part of the definition of \"Dietetics Practice\".I'm sure you've heard a number of times the education and training required of Registered Dietitian Nutritionists (RDNs) - it includes a minimum of a baccalaureate degree but also includes completing academic requirements of a didactic program in dietetics; successfully completing the registration examination for dietitians; and accrue seventy-five hours of approved continuing professional units every five years. Dietitians are specifically trained to do nutritional assessments.As a RDN, I am keenly aware of the need to share nutrition information in many settings. In fact, I work with many organizations that share nutrition information in an effort to promote health. The professionals I work with to do this are often not RDNs. So, for other nutrition professionals to indicate they are not able to work individually with clients, not able to ask questions of an individual to get a history or additional information, or to set up businesses in the state of Missouri, shows a clear misunderstanding of the licensure act and is misleading to this committee.Non-RDNs sharing nutrition information occurs on a regular basis. This is happening and has been happening for years across the country and across the state of Missouri. To indicate otherwise is untrue. Some examples of businesses currently set up to provide nutrition information to the public include Slim 4 Life, Weight Watchers, weight loss clinics, GNC, and many others. In addition, there are other programs in the state of MO that utilize nutritionists (those who may have a nutrition degree or nutrition training but are not RDNs), including government programs like nutritionists seeing clients in WIC clinics, health departments, and nutrition classes offered by university extension offices just to name a few. There are 6 exemptions in the current law that allow individual professionals to talk with their clients about food, diet and nutrition, as long as the person involved does not hold himself or herself out as a dietitian. Exemptions 5 and 6 are referenced below: 324.206 (5) Individuals who do not hold themselves out as dietitians marketing or distributing food products including dietary supplements as defined by the Food and Drug Administration or engaging in the explanation and education of customers regarding the use of such products. 324.206(6) Any person furnishing general nutrition information as to the use of food, food materials, or dietary supplements, nor prevent in any way the free dissemination of literature; provided, however, no such individual may call himself for herself a dietitian unless he or she is licensed under this chapter.In the testimony I've heard provided in the senate committee hearing as well as written testimony you've received, the information thatother practitioners who have obtained degrees and certificates related to nutrition education or health coaching aren't able to practice is at best misleading and at worst intentionally false. I implore you and your office to do the right thing, actually review the information, understand the purpose of licensure laws, and remove this bill. This issue is solely about conducting nutrition assessments and the prevention of harm. I want to share a couple of examples of the type of harm that can be caused when untrained individuals provide nutrition information without the knowledge of how to conduct a nutrition assessment and provide medical nutrition therapy:Example 1:In a long-term acute care hospital in SW Missouri, a 28-year-old female patient was re-admitted with blood clotting issues (recurrent deep vein thromboses (DVT)) after being taken off her oral contraceptives and placed on Coumadin by her medical team. This 28-year-old saw a woman calling herself a \"dietitian\" from a local health food store who recommended she consume Kelp pills to increase energy without obtaining any medical or medication history from the patient and was only recommending Kelp to address her fatigue. The implications of this were that the 28-year-old could have suffered a stroke. Luckily, she was only in the hospital for a couple of days allowing time for adequate nutrition assessment and education.Example 2:A patient was admitted to a psychiatric hospital in a total psychotic breakdown. After a few days of his routine meds, the patient recovered. It was revealed during a nutrition assessment that he recently decided that he and his wife needed to lose some weight so his wife discussed their needs with a \"Nutritionist\" on staff at a local health food store who sold her hundreds of dollars' worth of supplements customized for her and others customized for her spouse (without seeing him/getting health history/etc). These supplements contained herbs in dosages high enough to interfere with the action of his antidepressants and mood stabilizers that were prescribed by his physician and resulted in the psychotic breakdown. Without a licensure bill in place, the people harmed have no recourse when significant harm takes place. There are more examples such as these that can be shared. Again, I strongly urge you to do the right thing. Please protect Missourians by opposing HB 475 and keep the current language in place.Best,Shelly Summar, MSEd, RD, LDPast President Missouri Academy of Nutrition OF REPRESENTATIVES HB 475BILL NUMBER: DATE: 2/24/2021 COMMITTEE: Professional Registration and Licensing FOR INFORMATIONAL PURPOSES IN OPPOSITION TO IN SUPPORT OF TESTIFYING: WITNESS NAME THIS FORM IS PUBLIC RECORD UNDER CHAPTER 610, RSMo.

A license and education is required to provide dietician services to patients because nutrition is a science. Extending the ability to practice to unlicensed individuals like holistic medicine and chiropractors undermines the importance of the science of nutrition. I have had experiences where chiropractors try to tell me they can diagnose and cure illnesses like Lyme disease. Disease is not within the confines of their degrees or licenses and neither is nutrition, therefore it should not be practiced without a license and the appropriate schooling. Otherwise the risk of mismanagement or negligence in application is severely increased.WITNESS APPEARANCE FORMMISSOURI HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES HB 475BILL NUMBER: DATE: 2/24/2021 COMMITTEE: Professional Registration and Licensing FOR INFORMATIONAL PURPOSES IN OPPOSITION TO IN SUPPORT OF TESTIFYING: WITNESS NAME INFORMATION ON THIS FORM IS PUBLIC RECORD UNDER CHAPTER 610, RSMo. As a Licensed Clinical Social Worker, I work closely with Registered Dietitians as part of an Interdisciplinary Team on a daily basis. The role of dietitians in the healthcare field is critical for patients to receive the appropriate nutritional care they require. Registered Dietitians bring a wealth of education, knowledge, and experience to the medical field and ONLY individuals with the proper education and credentials should be able to complete nutrition assessments. Registered Dietitians, as with many licensed professionals, deserve the title protection they have worked so hard to obtain.

Basic nutrition knowledge--or information on healthful eating habits--are services that can be and are currently provided to the general public by health coaches, wellness advocates, and others with general nutrition training. On the other hand, personalized nutrition assessment is incredibly individualized and complex and now requires six years of bachelor's and master's level education in most states. This training in human physiology, metabolism, biochemistry, nutrition counseling, and other domains provides a scientist-practitioner foundation that prevents physical and mental harm to the individual seeking solutions for health care. I am a mother of three young children with an invested interest in nutrition. I made the decision three years ago to return to school to pursue RD credentials...what I have learned in these three years of biomedical science is that \"I didn't know what I didn't know\" about the human body and the way nutrition actually works. Protecting licensure for registered dietitians ensures that our state maintains high quality evidence-based nutrition care for its residents and protects our most vulnerable populations. It is in the interest of public health in the state of Missouri that I oppose HB 475 and urge you to vote in opposition.WITNESS APPEARANCE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES HB 475BILL NUMBER: DATE: 2/24/2021 COMMITTEE: Professional Registration and Licensing FOR INFORMATIONAL PURPOSES IN OPPOSITION TO IN SUPPORT OF TESTIFYING: WITNESS NAME INDIVIDUAL: THIS FORM IS PUBLIC RECORD UNDER CHAPTER 610, RSMo. The allowance of a non-licensed individual \"disseminating free literature or providing individual nutrition assessments, guidance, encouragement, recommendations, or weight control services\" as proposed in HB475 is misguided and a danger to a vulnerable population.

The proposed changes would eliminate protections for the health and wellbeing of the public by letting unqualified practitioners provide nutrition assessments to patients with nutrition-related diseases and medical conditions, thereby undermining the current licensure law.

I oppose these bills in order to ensure Missourians are protected from unqualified practitioners and unintended consequences associated with eliminating key protections in our state.WITNESS APPEARANCE FORMMISSOURI HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES HB 475BILL NUMBER: DATE: 2/24/2021 COMMITTEE: Professional Registration and Licensing FOR INFORMATIONAL PURPOSES IN OPPOSITION TO IN SUPPORT OF TESTIFYING: WITNESS NAME THIS FORM IS PUBLIC RECORD UNDER CHAPTER 610, RSMo. I am a Registered Dietitian. I have a Bachelor's degree in nutrition and dietetics, a Master's degree in health communication and completed over 1200 hours of supervised practice all over the state of Missouri. I spent weeks interning in public schools, non-profit organizations, the Missouri Department of Corrections, nursing homes and hospitals. Dietitians are nutrition experts. We have years of education meant to help us provide the public with accurate, evidence-based information. I OPPOSE this bill. Only Registered Dietitians should be allowed to provide MEDICAL NUTRITION THERAPY. Nutrition is very individualized, one size does not fit all. Each disease state is vast and requires great knowledge. Not only about food, but about nutrition assessment, diagnosis, interventions, counseling, monitoring, and evaluation. These are the things dietitians do when providing medical nutrition therapy. We identify the nutrition problem, define the etiology and gather evidence to show signs and symptoms. All of these steps are made with each patient to ensure they are provided the absolute best care. This bill looks to let anyone provide medical nutrition therapy. ANYONE. In Missouri, a license is required to be a: nurse, teacher, architect, athletic trainer, attorney, barber, broker, realtor, chiropractor, cosmetologist, dentist, EMT, land surveyor, social worker, massage therapist, mechanic, DIETITIAN and doctor, just to name a few. You wouldn't want ANYONE to cut your hair, survey your land, work on your car, crack your back, prescribe you medication, or perform surgery on your body, right? No. Medical nutrition therapy is more than providing diet advice for a certain disease. It's counseling, regular assessments, interpreting laboratory data, and more. These are things not just anyone can do. Dietitians are highly educated and trained to do this. We use evidence-based nutrition information to manage specific disease states and/or conditions. This is necessary for the well-being of the public. Anything less would certainly cause harm. That is why I oppose this bill.WITNESS APPEARANCE FORMMISSOURI HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES HB 475BILL NUMBER: DATE: 2/24/2021 COMMITTEE: Professional Registration and Licensing FOR INFORMATIONAL PURPOSES IN OPPOSITION TO IN SUPPORT OF TESTIFYING: WITNESS NAME THIS FORM IS PUBLIC RECORD UNDER CHAPTER 610, RSMo. As your constituent, a registered dietitian nutritionist intern, and a member of Missouri Academy of Nutrition and Dietetics, I strongly oppose the changes proposed in HB 475 relating to the Licensure of Dietitians.Missouri's Dietitian Practice Act (Chapter 324.200-324.225 RSMo) was enacted in 1998 to protect the public from demonstrated harm and to recognize the education standards needed to provide vital health care services to the public and it has worked effectively for more than twenty years. The proposed exemption in HB 475 would swallow the rule, eliminating key protections for Missourians seeking to treat or manage diseases and other medical conditions from unqualified individuals, especially during these times of uncertainties and the exponential growth of social media. I am currently completing my dietetic rotations with Lagniappe Wellness, which after completion, will allow me to be eligible to take the national CDR dietetic exam. Upon passing that exam, I will finally be granted the protected title of Registered Dietitian Nutritionist, which will allow me to attain a licensure in the state of Missouri to support individuals in my community with medical nutritional therapy. It has been a rigorous process to undertake, but there are no other programs that ensure an individual is qualified to provide and practice evidence-based nutrition therapy to support an individual's health and well-being. To be clear, the current law does not prevent anyone from \"talk[ing] with individual clients about healthy eating and nutrition\" and unless unlicensed individuals are seeking to provide individualized counseling to treat or manage patients and clients with diseases or medical conditions, they will continue to be exempt from the current licensing law. To underscore this fact, the Division of Professional Registration - State Committee of Dietitians reports that there have been no complaints about someone providing the nutrition information or advice proponents assert they are unable to provide and thus the Committee has had no reason to discipline or sanction these unlicensed providers. In short, the Dietitian Practice Act is working as intended. Despite these facts (and our national organization's ongoing efforts to collaborate with proponents to clarify misunderstandings of the law here in Missouri and elsewhere), HB 475 offers a dangerously disproportionate solution in search of a merely hypothetical problem; it would newly allow anyone without any training or background to provide complex medical nutrition therapies to patients with nutrition-related diseases and medical conditions. Just how a self-proclaimed \"holistic doctor\" convinced my parents of purchasing supplements and octopus tea for years to cure my sisters infections, which she took for years. The culprit, not a mineral dysbiosis, but enlarged thyroid glands that were causing her to get ill. With the surgical removal of her thyroid glands and a visit to a dietitian to support my parents in preventing malnutrition, I have seen my sister thrive. Individuals in desperation may fall victim to pseudo-scientific procedures and/or alternative forms of medication, just like my parents did. Now that I am older, I understand that if California had the same restrictions as Missouri, my family would have avoided 4 years of agony, stress, and unnecessary financial burden that a so-called \"holistic doctor\" made us go through. Our trust and faith are with you, our legislature representatives, to move forwardpolicies that will keep us, your constituents safe. Thus, I urge you to oppose HB 475 to avoid grave unintended consequences of eliminating these critical, effective, and narrowly tailored consumer protections that the Dietitian Practice Act offers Missourians.Thank you for your time and for opposing HB 475.With Gratitude, Virginia PearsonWITNESS NUMBER: DATE: 2/24/2021 COMMITTEE: Professional Registration and Licensing FOR INFORMATIONAL PURPOSES IN OPPOSITION TO IN SUPPORT OF TESTIFYING: WITNESS NAME FORM IS PUBLIC RECORD UNDER CHAPTER 610, RSMo.

As a Registered Dietitian working with many patients and clients, it is enlightening the difference in approach that dietitians use, which is backed with evidence-based recommendations compared to other individuals attempting to give misinformation to patients that can cause physical or financial harm. We pride ourselves and take an oath ethically to do no harm, physically or financially. We are required every Certification period to re-sign that oath and take continuing education to ensure our ethical behaviors. I strongly opposed HB 475 that would put our Missouri citizens at risk for such harm from individuals that are not held accountable for their practicing behaviors.WITNESS APPEARANCE FORMMISSOURI HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES HB 475BILL NUMBER: DATE: 2/24/2021 COMMITTEE: Professional Registration and Licensing FOR INFORMATIONAL PURPOSES IN OPPOSITION TO IN SUPPORT OF TESTIFYING: WITNESS NAME INDIVIDUAL: WITNESS THIS FORM IS PUBLIC RECORD UNDER CHAPTER 610, RSMo. AS a registered dietitian I have received extensive training on performing nutrition assessments, that extend beyond a questionnaire or assessing weight changes. I currently serve my community as a contract dietitian for the elderly as well as working for the Department of Veterans Affairs visiting rural Veterans in their homes to provide nutrition care. My training allows me to identify when malnutrition, dysphagia, or heart failure may be present. All of these diagnosis require an interdisciplinary approach for best result. Health coaches lack the training and experience in performing extensive nutrition assessments and nutrition focused exams.

I am a student and intern pursuing Registered Dietitians(RD/RDN) credentials. This bill would result in poor outcomes for RDs/RDNs and the people who need their care most. RDs/RDNs have spent numerous years studying nutrition and the science of food and physiology so they can provide accurate and adequate nutrition education and treatment to people most in need. Individuals who have not undergone the same training and requirements that RDs/RDNs have undergone should not be allowed to disperse nutrition information as they do not understand many aspects of nutrition fully. Dispersing information that is inaccurate only hurts those who receive it, has potential to further aggregate nutrition-related issue, and disregards the credentials of practicing RDs/RDNs.WITNESS APPEARANCE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES HB 475BILL NUMBER: DATE: 2/24/2021 COMMITTEE: Professional Registration and Licensing FOR INFORMATIONAL PURPOSES IN OPPOSITION TO IN SUPPORT OF TESTIFYING: WITNESS NAME THIS FORM IS PUBLIC RECORD UNDER CHAPTER 610, RSMo. This immediately makes us all unsafe. Holistic practitioners and whole health coaches want to be able to complete nutrition assessments which is out of their scope of practice.

I am opposed to HB 475. I am the current president of the Missouri Academy of Nutrition & Dietetics. I have been a dietitian for over 17 years. I am also a wellness coach and American Council on Exercise certified personal trainer. I also work at the St. Louis VA and have my private practice. I work with health coaches in both locations. I appreciate representative Grier's intent behind this bill has he works to fulfill his goal of examining professional licenses to make them work better for professionals and the people served by those professionals. Unfortunately, this bill in it's current form has language that does just the opposite. Essentially this bill unintendedly, gives permission to anyone with a pulse to work within the scope of practice of a licensed health care professional, the registered dietitian. The bill allows for anyone to perform a nutrition assessment without a dietetics license as long as they don't call themselves a dietitian. The nutrition assessment is the entirety of what we do as dietitians. It is mainly used for evaluation and nutrition management of patients with complex medical conditions. I think this language was included in the bill due to a lack of understanding of what a nutrition assessment entails .I have read many of the testimonies of the supporters of this bill. Most of what they are suggesting that they can not do, is already allowed in the Dietetics Practices Act. I heard one witness in the SB 232 hearing suggest that she is unable to ask a client whether they have a food allergy or any intolerances. Another witness stated that she can not ask any food related question of her clients. A nutrition assessment is not a series of questions. It is much more than that. The Dietetics Practice Act does not prohibit unlicensed individuals from asking nutrition related questions or using questionnaires. Also, most of the testimonies do not mention a request for the ability to do nutrition assessments. Many of them are stating that they do not wish to treat disease or cure disease. Therefore, they are providing general nutrition information, which does not require is a nutrition assessment. Some have mentioned that they can't provide individualized interventions to their clients. I think to explain how that is false, I need to explain what health and wellness coaching consists of. It is a process of developing client led goals. It is centered around behavior change strategies. There is nothing in the Dietetic Practice Act that prohibits this. Last year, members of organization met with leaders from the groups behind this bill. We essentially explained to the them that everything they were saying they could not do was already allowed for in the current exemptions. If this many unlicensed wellness professional are this confused on what is they are allowed to do, then maybe the language in the Dietetics Practice Act could be more clear, however the language of HB 475 is harmful.WITNESS APPEARANCE NUMBER: DATE: 2/24/2021 COMMITTEE: Professional Registration and Licensing FOR INFORMATIONAL PURPOSES IN OPPOSITION TO IN SUPPORT OF TESTIFYING: WITNESS THIS FORM IS PUBLIC RECORD UNDER CHAPTER 610, RSMo. I am opposed to HB 475. I am a registered and licensed dietitian, a wellness coach, and a certified personal trainer. I received my education and training at the University of Missouri-Columbia and completed my internships in hospitals and community sites throughout the region and passed the commission on dietetic registration exam to become a registered dietitian nutritionist. That training is the basis for working with patients and clients who have medical conditions that require nutrition interventions. Because of my varied background in personal training and wellness coaching, I also understand the scope of practice of multiple wellness professional groups.The groups that are asking for the law to be changed do not have a clear understanding of the difference between a questionnaire and a nutrition assessment. They have repeatedly stated that they can't ask their clients any question that is nutrition related because of the Dietetics Practice Act. Questions are not assessments. Questions must be asked so that the health coach can know when to refer a client to a dietitian because providing care for that client is out of their scope of practice. Even personal trainers have a questionnaire called a PAR-Q that asks questions regarding a client's medical status to be sure that the client is appropriate for personal training. If a client has certain health risk factors, he would have to get clearance from his doctor to workout with certain parameters or he may be referred to a physical therapist and exercise physiologist instead. Thus, when a client is seen by a health coach or a nutrition professional who is not a dietitian, the provider must ask questions of their clients. That is not the same as nutrition assessment. The group behind this bill is either knowingly or unknowingly misrepresenting what a nutrition assessment entails in order to be granted permission to do so. A nutrition assessment involves reviewing medical diagnoses, gastrointestinal symptoms, medications, labs, diet history, anthropometric measurements, performing a nutrition focused physical exams, etc. for the purpose of providing an individualized nutrition intervention and diet recommendations. The Missouri Dietitians Practice Act helps to keep patients/clients in Missouri safe as individuals providing complex nutrition services without proper training and education can cause great harm. The only purpose of doing a nutrition assessment is to provide a basis on how to treat an individual client who has complex medical problems. The holistic group continues to say they don't want to treat disease, well then why would they need to perform a nutrition assessment? A client who does not have a complex history will not require a nutrition assessment. A questionnaire will be enough for health coach/non-RD nutrition professional to provide general nutrition information to their clients. What they are saying they cannot do is just not true. What they are asking is for any lay person regardless of training or background to be able to perform a service that requires a significant amount of training and skill. The group behind this bill has stated that dietitians have a monopoly in Missouri. If dietitians have a monopoly over nutrition therapy, then doctors have a monopoly over medicine, physical therapists over physical rehab, licensed massage therapists over massage, etc. We would welcome anyone to our profession, so long as they obtain the designated education and training.

This bill does not directly effect my profession as a health educator as it does my peers who are dietitians and those who are currently training to become Registered Dietitians. This bill was brought to my attention by my fellow classmates and instructor as I am currently pursuing a graduate degree in the field of public health alongside those in the field of dietetics. As discussion about HB 475 went on during a class discussion I realized how the passage of this bill will make it harder for myself to effectively do my job in the future. I also realized what negative outcomes may have happened in my last position if the knowledge of registered dietitians was being conflicted by other sources. Before pursuing a master's degree I was a part of an interprofessional health team who cared for patients with chronic illnesses. Some of these patients had been diagnosed with diabetes and needed to meet with the Registered Dietitian on the team. With the help of the dietitian these patient's diabetes was managed and severe health complications were avoided. Now I think what if these patients were given information from someone who was given the same responsibilities as a RDN to provide them with important information without having the same intensive training and experiences as RDN's. Ultimately the patient would face adverse health outcomes because of the knowledge they were given from someone who they perceived as having the same credentials as an RDN. With the passage of HB 475 patients will be the ones negatively effected and others like myself will have more public health issues to combat because this bill effects more than those involved in dietetics.WITNESS APPEARANCE FORMMISSOURI HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES HB 475BILL NUMBER: DATE: 2/24/2021 COMMITTEE: Professional Registration and Licensing FOR INFORMATIONAL PURPOSES IN OPPOSITION TO IN SUPPORT OF TESTIFYING: WITNESS NAME THIS FORM IS PUBLIC RECORD UNDER CHAPTER 610, RSMo.

Dear Committee Members: I am submitting this testimony in opposition to House Bill 475. Nutrition practitioners are currently able to work at their scope of practice and see individual clients in the state of Missouri. HB 475 allows any person to \"provide individualized nutrition assessment\". Individualized nutrition assessment requires specialized skills only available through appropriate education. Requiring professionals wanting to provide this service to be licensed is appropriate to assure people are receiving the therapy needed to have the best possible nutritional health and provide protections. The Missouri licensure act defines a scope of practice and providing nutrition assessment is part of the definition of \"Dietetics Practice\". Registered Dietitian Nutritionists (RDNs) are required to have appropriate education and training, including a minimum of a baccalaureate degree AND the completion of the academic requirements of a didactic program in dietetics. RDNs must also successfully completing the registration examination for dietitians, and they must complete seventy- five hours of approved continuing professional units every five years. Dietitians are specifically trained to do nutritional assessments. Yes, Missourians need nutrition education in a variety of settings. There are many organizations in Missouri which have staff who are not RDNs which provide nutrition education appropriately, according to their qualifications and scope of work. This has been happening in Missouri for many years. Indicating that nutrition professionals are not able to ask questions of an individual to get a history or additional information, or to set up businesses in the state of Missouri, shows a clear misunderstanding of the licensure act. There are 6 exemptions in the current licensure law that allow individual professionals to talk with their clients about food, diet and nutrition, however those professionals cannot hold themselves out as dietitians. People have been harmed by receiving incorrect nutrition services from people holding themselves out as a dietitian, when in fact, they were not. I am sure you have received several s examples of harm that has occurred. If you would like to have those examples shared with you, please let me know.Without a licensure bill in place, the people harmed have no recourse. Please protect Missourians by opposing HB 475 and keep the current language in place. Sincerely,Donna "}
