Natural for Your Cats and Convenient for You The key to having your cat always use its litter box is to keep it clean. Scoop the box daily to keep it fresh and encourage your cat to always come back. Have more than one cat... have more than one litter box. Place the litter box in a quiet place, away from noisy appliances and high traffic areas. A Clean Litter Box Means a Good Home for Your Cat Establish routines for your cat. Feed your cat regularly at the same time and in the same place every day. Playtime is important, at least 15 minutes a day. Keep toys handy and a scratching post nearby. A happy, content cat is least likely to develop behavior problems. Always wash your hands thoroughly after handling the litter box. A parasite sometimes found in cat feces can cause toxoplasmosis. Encouraging your cat to use an indoor litter box, or properly disposing of outdoor cat feces, is beneficial to overall water quality. Please do not flush cat litter in toilets or dispose of it outdoors in gutters or storm drains. Our free guide is the same booklet found in every bag of Cat Attract\u00ae. Unfortunately, cats don't buy their own litter. If they could, they would buy a litter that has an outdoors-natural scent, like your freshly turned garden. Cat Attract\u00ae is the answer. It has a unique herbal scent that attracts their curiosity and the right texture for their paws. Although you may not be aware of Cat Attract\u00ae's scent, your cat will. You don't like a dirty bathroom, and neither does your cat. Their sense of smell is 1000 times better than yours, so clean the litter box and refill with Cat Attract\u00ae. Remove feces and urine clumps daily. If your cat does not respond to a clean litter box, you may need to replace it. Some old boxes are scratched and permeated with a scent your cat may find offensive. Replace it and set up a second litter box in a different area. Having one more litter box than you have cats is a good idea. Once a cat has marked an area with urine or feces, problem cats naturally regard it as an appropriate area for relieving themselves. Do all that you can to eliminate any trace of odor from the \"trouble spot.\" Clean it thoroughly with a liquid enzymatic odor cleaner. Avoid ammonia-based cleaners, which actually contribute to the problem because of their urine-like scent. Try to keep your cat away from the trouble spot by covering the area with a plastic carpet runner, spike side up, or tin foil (cats dislike the feel of foil). A lemon scented air freshener will also help in both repelling the cat and neutralizing the odor. If your cat still can't resist the area, try placing its food there; cats are unlikely to urinate or defecate where they eat. Try using your cat's own fragrance to your advantage: rub a cloth between your cat's eye and ear to pick up its scent, then rub the cloth over the problem area. Recognizing its own scent on the carpet, floor, or furniture, a cat may be reluctant to soil the area again. Do this two to three times a day to be most effective. Hooded litter boxes are for owners, not cats. Try removing the hood and rethink the location of the boxes. They should be in quiet, out-of-the-way places with convenient access for your cats, but no access for the family dog (some dogs will stay around a litter box and make the cat nervous).Keep the boxes away from bright lights, loud noises, and vibrations from washing machines or furnaces. Set up one more box than you have cats in your household to cut down on traffic and mess. If your house has several floors, have a box on each level for your cat's convenience. Finally, do not put a litter box near the cat's food dishes - this is no more appealing for a kitty than it would be for you! Stress is a leading cause of litter box problems. Fortunately, there is a lot you can do to ease your cat's worried mind. Territorial by nature, cats need to feel secure in their environment in order to relax. In multiple cat households, make sure each cat has a separate \"zone\" with its own food, water, litter box, and a safe, elevated perch for relaxing. Thermal Kitty heated beds and carpeted Cat Condos make excellent retreats for your stressed feline. Play with your cat for at least 15 minutes every day, making sure he has plenty of toys to stalk and chase. "}
