Watch the video below to hear more about people's experience of using homeopathy. Homeopathy Classical and Sensations Method Homeopath Sarah Lane, MAHons, RSHom, DSH. My approach I am a Classical Homeopath and trained at The School of Homeopathy in Devon. I am a registered member of The Society of Homeopaths. I am passionate about homeopathy. I feel that it is a deeply healing modality that can help transform people's lives. I am dedicated to helping my patients on their healing journey to better health. Being a Classical Homeopath means that I look for a single remedy that covers your presenting complaint, as well as how you are feeling in general - physically and emotionally. Homeopathy is a holistic medicine that treats the person as a whole, rather than treating specific conditions in isolation and usually with one single remedy. Patients have come to me for help with a wide range of conditions, both acute and chronic, from anxiety and depression, to allergies and hayfever, childhood ailments, menstrual problems and skin conditions, amongst many others. I have a special interest in helping patients with mental and emotional health problems. Book an Appointment Sarah is currently unable to take new clients, but please register your interest by email.

How I can help you Patients have come to me for help with a wide range of conditions, both acute and chronic, from anxiety and depression, to allergies and hayfever, childhood ailments, menstrual problems and skin conditions, amongst many others. I have a special interest in treating patients with mental and emotional health problems. A successful homeopathic treatment aims not only for relief from symptoms, but also for a greatly increased sense of well-being. Why see me? I have a heartfelt philosophy to my practice. I aim to provide a safe and supportive environment for you to explore your health concerns. My style of homeopathy is deep and the results are deep acting. I aim to understand on the deepest level how your experience is for you, in order to find the closest match to a remedy that can transform your health. As homeopaths, we treat all conditions, rather than specialising in specific areas. Alongside treating a wide range of conditions, I have a special interest in treating patients, both adults and children, with mental and emotional health problems. As we become more hectic and busy and time gets more stretched, many of us struggle to maintain a sense of equilibrium. Homeopathy can gently help regain a more balanced state of emotional health. What is a homeopathic remedy? Homeopathic remedies are made from natural sources, predominantly from animals, minerals and plants. We have over 3,000 remedies available for us to choose from. Remedies are made in regulated pharmacies, where the original source substance is diluted and succussed and then used to medicate small, sugar pills or added to alcohol to be taken in drop form. Qualifications and experience Having graduated from Edinburgh University with an MA in English Literature, I then qualified as an Aromatherapist, training at ITHMA at Regents College in London. I went on to study Classical Homeopathy with Misha Norland at The School of Homeopathy in Devon - the UK's oldest, and one of the most respected, colleges of homeopathy. I graduated in 2008 with a Diploma in Homeopathy, which enabled me to become a full member of The Society of Homeopaths. I have also studied extensively with Bhawisha and Shachindra Joshi. I have 13 years experience practising as a Classical and Sensations Method Homeopath. I am currently in the final year of a research MSc in Integrated Healthcare and am also a member of the Society of Homeopath's Research Committee. Alongside my practice, I have also worked at Helios Homeopathic Pharmacy in Covent Garden in London, prescribing for patients over the phone and in the Pharmacy shop, as well as dispensing homeopathic remedies. I also volunteered for two years at a homeless centre in Marlow with a homeopathic colleague. What can homeopathy treat? As homeopaths, we are not trained to give you a medical diagnosis for your condition. I encourage my patients to maintain a positive relationship with their GP and other healthcare providers, as homeopathy can be a fantastic complement to conventional treatments, as well a positive alternative for those seeking a different way to achieving and maintaining good health. Homeopathy is great for first aid treatments of acutes, such as coughs, colds, stings etc, and constitutional homeopathic treatment is very effective in treating conditions that have become long term and chronic, for example, recurring infections, allergies, migraines and eczema. As homoeopathy treats the spiritual, emotional, mental and physical levels, patients seek the help of homeopathy with a wide range of diagnosis. The aim in homeopathy is for the patient to attain optimum health of mind, body and spirit. How does homeopathy work? \"Like cures like\" In homeopathy, we use the idea that 'like cures like'. For example, if we chop up an onion, our eyes start to sting and water. If we have hay fever with these specific symptoms, a good homeopathic remedy to take is Allium Cepa - the Latin name for Onion. If we eat the berries of the deadly nightshade plant (Latin name - Belladonna), we will suffer from strong headaches and very high fevers, with glazed, glassy eyes. If a patient has these symptoms, we prescribe Belladonna as a homeopathic remedy. The response can be amazingly fast! By matching the symptoms of the original material substance to symptoms of the patient, we are able to stimulate the body's own innate healing mechanism. Minimum dose In homeopathy, less is definitely more! With conventional medicine, we often have to take more and more of a drug to maintain its effect, perhaps in stronger and stronger doses. With homeopathy, the aim is to match the homeopathic remedy to the patient's state and then wait and assess. The action of a single remedy may last for weeks or even months before it needs to be repeated. Successful homeopathy is not just about the administering of the correct remedy, but also about the skilled review and management of the case. "}
