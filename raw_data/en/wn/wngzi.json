Treatment for Rare Conditions We remove rare endocrine tumors called paragangliomas and adrenal cancers that are often difficult to treat. We also treat adrenocortical carcinoma and a rare genetic condition called congenital adrenal hyperplasia, which affects the gland's ability to produce hormones. Personalized Care Hormone imbalances associated with adrenal disorders can cause [high blood pressure](https://www.dukehealth.org/treatments/heart/coronary-artery-disease/high-blood-pressure-hypertension), cardiovascular problems, and metabolic issues.
