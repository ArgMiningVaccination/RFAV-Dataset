FINAL ENVIRONMENTAL ASSESSMENT 7 HALEKAUWILA PLACE APRIL 2010 SECTION TWO PROPOSED PROJECT AND STATEMENT OF OBJECTIVES 2.1 PROJECT LOCATION The project is located at the southeastern corner of the intersection of Halekauwila and Keawe Streets in Kakaako, Honolulu, Hawaii. The site is identified as Tax Map Key: 2-1-51: portion of 9. The site is owned by the State of Hawaii and also consists of ceded lands. The project site is located within the Kakaako Community Development District (KCDD) Mauka Area which dictates the regulatory zoning laws for the project site. The project area is zoned for public use under the KCDD Mauka Area Plan and is subject to the KCDD Mauka Area Rules. The project site represents a portion of a consolidated block that is presently bounded by Halekauwila Street to the northeast (mauka), Cooke Street to the southeast (Diamond Head), Pohukaina Street to the southwest (makai), and Keawe Street to northwest (Ewa). Other uses on the project block include the Mother Waldron Playground along Cooke Street and the Department of Education Library Services warehouse along Pohukaina Street. This use for the project site was selected for its central urban location, proximity to community and medical services, and availability. The project block was the subject of a master development plan created in 2000 which examined the revitalization and development of the entire block as a unified community core element. The master plan concept was developed by the Hawaii Community Development Authority, the Department of Education, the Hawaii Housing Finance and Development Corporation, and the Department of Parks and Recreation. Under the master plan proposal, of which the proposed housing development was an integral component, a community park and an elementary school would also be planned for development albeit at individual schedules as funding allows. The elementary school site is presently identified for future development however its use is not determined at this time. Park improvements will be installed in year 2010. 2.2 PROJECT DESCRIPTION 2.2.1 REQUEST FOR PROPOSAL PROCESS Under the initiative of the Hawaii Housing Finance and Development Corporation (HHFDC), a Request for Proposals to develop an affordable housing was issued for the subject project site. FINAL ENVIRONMENTAL ASSESSMENT 8 HALEKAUWILA PLACE APRIL 2010 FIGURE 1: LOCATION MAP FINAL ENVIRONMENTAL ASSESSMENT 9 HALEKAUWILA PLACE APRIL 2010 FIGURE 2: TAX MAP FINAL ENVIRONMENTAL ASSESSMENT 10 HALEKAUWILA PLACE APRIL 2010 FIGURE 3: SURVEY BOUNDARY MAP FINAL ENVIRONMENTAL ASSESSMENT 11 HALEKAUWILA PLACE APRIL 2010 Through this RFP process, the Applicant was selected for its proposal to develop a high-rise affordable rental housing project. The applicant's proposal was selected and a 65-year lease will be issued to the Applicant by HHFCD. 2.2.2 CONCEPTUAL DESIGN A conceptual design was developed to provide a model of optimal density, provision of residential units, meeting areas, and supporting retail spaces. Numerous iterations of the design were developed with the present model selected as the most efficient design with the least impact on the surrounding environment. The project was also designed to ensure a desirable appearance. As presently proposed, the project will consist of approximately 188,777 square feet and will provide up to 3,898 square feet of open space on the 54,407 square foot lot. 2.2.3 RESIDENTIAL UNITS The proposed project will consist of a mix of studio, 1-bedroom, 2-bedroom and 3-bedroom units located within the tower structure or the parking structure. Units within the tower structure are located around a centrally located elevator lobby. Studio units will range from 414 to 433 square feet. The studio units will be located on floors 2 through 19. One-bedroom units will range from 581 to 643 square feet and will also be located on floors 2 through 19. Two-bedroom units will be generally located from floor 2 through 19 with the exception of the resident manager's unit which will be located on the ground floor. Two-bedroom units will range from 749 to 771 square feet. The resident manager's unit will consist of 903 square feet. Three-bedroom units located in the tower will be 1,106 square feet in size and will be located on floors 2 through 19. Five three-bedroom units of 1,382 square feet will be located on the ground level of the parking structure building. Studio Units 26 Units One-bedroom 72 Units Two-Bedroom 83 Units Three-Bedroom 18 Units Three-Bedroom Townhouse 5 Units The project will consist of a total of 204 residential units. 2.2.4 PARKING AND VEHICULAR ACCESS A total of 284 resident and guest parking stalls will be provided within the structure or adjacent to the driveway on five parking levels. This total will comprise of: Residential Parking: 222 stalls Office Parking: 3 stalls FINAL ENVIRONMENTAL ASSESSMENT 12 HALEKAUWILA PLACE APRIL 2010 Retail Parking: 8 stalls Additional Parking: 49 stalls Of the total of 282 parking stalls, 44 of the stalls will be reserved for public use, offsetting the minimal loss of on-street metered parking. All parking will be accessed through Halekauwila Street. Sight lines at this access point offer good visibility of pedestrians and vehicular traffic movement in both directions. A curb cut and access lane with hammerhead maneuvering area is provided on Keawe Street but this driveway is limited to loading, Handi-Van access and trash collection. No reverse out movements will be required into the public right-of-way. 2.2.5 TOWER GROUND LEVEL The lobby level of the tower structure will include a lobby, service and mechanical areas, laundry, restrooms and a community room. The community center's location next to the park is ideally suited to serve residents of the building as well as other community groups within the project vicinity. In addition, there will be a leasing/management office, a police officer work office, and a retail space. 2.2.6 PARKING STRUCTURE GROUND LEVEL The ground level of the parking structure provides a single entry/exit point to Halekauwila Street. Handicap parking is located on the ground level as are a mechanical room and two retail spaces. Unique to the project are five two-storey townhouse units located on the Diamond Head end of the project. 2.3 PROJECT OBJECTIVE The applicant is proposing the development of an affordable rental housing project. The project, which was selected through a Request for Proposal (RFP) process, will provide critical rental housing inventory for the urban core. This project is consistent with the State's Blueprint for Affordable Housing to increase rental housing. Income and eligibility requirements for the project will be determined by the project owner in coordination with the Hawaii Housing Finance and Development Corporation. 2.4 FUNDING AND SCHEDULE The total development cost of approximately $65,000,000 will be borne by the applicant. HHFCD and HCDA issued loans of approximately $15,000,000 to the project total. The land is owned by the State of Hawaii and has been leased to the applicant for a term of 65 years.

A mix of high-rise residential structures, warehouses, commercial and industrial uses are located within the project vicinity. The site is also located in the core of the KCDD Mauka Area. The project site is located on a relatively flat open urban site that is presently used as a public day-rate parking lot. The paved lot was formerly in use for warehousing and other light industrial operations. All structures were cleared from the site and the open area paved. There are minimal improvements within the site. The project lot is partially surrounded by perimeter chain-link fencing and a small wooden toll booth is located at the parking lot access point off Pohukaina Street. Medium to large shade trees are located along the project boundaries however the site is otherwise devoid of any vegetation. The project block, on which the project site is located, consists of the Mother Waldron urban park along Cooke Street, and the Department of Education Library Services warehouse along Pohukaina Street. The park consists of a comfort station, basketball courts and a low wall along the perimeter and the former Coral Street right-of-way. The Library Services complex consists of a single warehouse and appurtenant on-grade parking. An office trailer is located immediately mauka of the warehouse and is formerly used as a Police Department beat officer base. All utilities are located underground 3.2 SURROUNDING USES Adjacent uses include senior housing and commercial uses mauka of the block, commercial/ industrial uses in the Diamond Head direction, commercial/ warehouse uses in the makai area, and a vacant lot in the Ewa direction. All surrounding areas are or were heavily urbanized with no areas left in a natural, undisturbed condition. Roadways and infrastructure in the surrounding areas have been the subject of recent upgrades and improvements consistent with the KCDD Mauka Area Plan. All utilities have been placed underground. Many of the surrounding blocks have supported high-rise development while other blocks, such as the adjacent Ewa block were once planned for high-rise residential projects. FINAL ENVIRONMENTAL ASSESSMENT 26 HALEKAUWILA PLACE APRIL 2010 3.3 MASTER PLAN As summarized in the Pohukaina School Development Master Plan prepared for the State of Hawaii Community Development Authority by AM Partners, Inc. in November 2000, the purpose of the master plan process was to determine the feasibility of development on the project block to accommodate three proposed uses. 1) A Department of Education (DOE) Elementary School 2) An enhanced community park 3) An Elderly Housing facility planned by the HCDCH. Through an extensive charette process by the master planning participants, numerous schemes were developed. The following scheme is used as the basis for the proposed project. The scheme used as the basis of future development on the site integrates the existing historic comfort station with the other essential components of the site. Under this plan, the elementary school is located on the corner of Pohukaina and Keawe Streets with an administrative center located on the prominent corner. A drop-off area was provided from Keawe Street and parking is provided with access from Pohukaina Street allowing for the possibility of joint use with the adjacent park. Classrooms are organized in the main building around an interior courtyard and connected to the cafeteria/multipurpose building by a covered walkway. An exterior courtyard is created between the two buildings for school gatherings and assemblies. This scheme also located the housing facility subject of this document on the corner of Keawe and Halekauwila Streets. This location was noted by participants to be well suited due to its convenient access to the City bus system. Access to parking is provided from Halekauwila Street. An open area adjacent to the building is provided for senior activities. The walls of the historic comfort station help define the boundaries of the park space. An open play field was provided at the corner of Cooke and Pohukaina Streets for shared use by the school and community park functions. A volleyball court and a basketball court are provided adjacent to the comfort station along Cooke Street. A recreational/ community center is planned at the corner of Halekauwila and Cooke Streets with an adjacent courtyard area for the community Farmer's Market program. Subsequent to the issuance of the above referenced Master Plan, the DOE site remains inactive with no immediate plan for development. It has been determined that the need for affordable rental housing is now of the highest priority and therefore, the proposed action has been initiated. FINAL ENVIRONMENTAL ASSESSMENT 27 HALEKAUWILA PLACE APRIL 2010 3.4 ENVIRONMENTAL CONSIDERATIONS 3.4.1 GEOLOGICAL CHARACTERISTICS Topography The project site is essentially flat and has been graded and paved to serve as a parking lot. Warehouse/industrial uses formerly occupied the site. A small tollbooth is located along the Pohukaina Street entrance to the parking lot. Vegetation is limited to a few shade trees along the perimeter and weedy species in broken paving areas. Climate The geography of the Honolulu District is typically warm and dry in climate. Prevailing tradewinds arrive from the northeast. According to the National Weather Service Honolulu Office, over a period of 30 years, normal monthly high temperatures range from 80 degrees in January to a high of 89 degrees in August for an average of 84 degrees. Normal month low temperatures range from a low of 65 degrees in February and a high of 74 degrees in August for a monthly average of 70 degrees. Precipitation typically ranges from 0.44 inches in August to a high of 3.8 inches in December. The annual average rainfall in Honolulu is 70 inches per year. USDA Soil Survey Report The project site is located on soils classified FL fill land according to the Soil Survey of Islands of Kauai, Oahu, Maui, Molokai, and Lanai, State of Hawaii by the U.S. Department of Agriculture Soil Conservation Service. Fill land is typically found near Pearl Harbor and in Honolulu, adjacent to the ocean. It consists of areas filled with material dredged from the ocean or hauled from nearby areas, garbage, and general material from other sources. This land type is used for urban development including airports, housing areas, and industrial facilities. 3.4.2 WATER RESOURCES Hydrologic Hazards and Resources According to Panel 150001 0115 C of the Federal Emergency Management Agency Flood Insurance Rate Map, the project site is located in Zone X an area determined to be outside the 500-year flood plain. FINAL ENVIRONMENTAL ASSESSMENT 28 HALEKAUWILA PLACE APRIL 2010 Tsunami Inundation The Civil Defense Tsunami Inundation Maps Panel 19 indicates that the project site is not located in an area vulnerable to tsunami inundation (Verizon Hawaii). Special Management Area The project site is not located within the boundaries of the Special Management Area (SMA) Map. 3.4.3 HISTORICAL AND ARCHAEOLOGICAL ASSESSMENT A study titled Archaeological Assessment of the Proposed Halekauwila Place Project, Kakaako, Honolulu District, Oahu Island was prepared by Cultural Surveys Hawaii in August 2009. The study is summarized in this section and included in its entirety as Appendix A. Overview of Kaka'ako The modern urban district known as Kaka'ako is significantly larger than the traditional area of the same name, which is described in mid-19th century documents and maps as a small 'ili (traditional land unit within an ahupua'a) within the ahupua'a (traditional land division) of Honolulu. In addition to the 'ili of Kaka'ako, the modern Kaka'ako area also includes lands once known as Ka'kaukukui, Kukulue'o, and Kewalo, and Ka'ala'a, 'pua, and The current is located within the Pu'unui area of Ka'kaukukui 'Ili. The original location and extent of an area called Kaka'ako is ambiguous. The ethnographer Henry Kekahuna (1958:4), who was born in Hawai'i in 1891 and was a long-time resident of O'ahu, placed it \"on the Ewa side of Kuloloia Stream where the Honolulu Iron Works and Fort Armstrong are now,\" an area now covered by One Waterfront Plaza (between South and Punchbowl Streets). Kekahuna (1958:4) also related that \"there were formerly scattered dunes of white sand there. Gilbert Islanders (Kilipaki) squatted there, and made a living by fishing, collecting coral for curios, and catching octopus.\" Only four LCA claims list their location as within the 'ili of Kaka'ako. These are also generally located adjacent to the sea, east of Punchbowl Street between Pohukaina Street and Reed Lane. The 1884 map of the \"Kewalo\" section of Honolulu by S.E. Bishop does not show an area named Kaka'ako at all. On an 1897 map of Honolulu by M.D. Monsarrat, the area adjacent to the coastal wharfs is labeled Kaka'ako. These maps and documents all place the 'ili of Kaka'ako at the western end of the modern Kaka'ako district. The only late nineteenth century map that has a mark for Kaka'ako east of this general area is an 1876 C.J. Lyons map of Ka'kaukukui FINAL ENVIRONMENTAL ASSESSMENT 29 HALEKAUWILA PLACE APRIL 2010 and Pu'unui, which has a coastal point (marked by a triangle) labeled Kaka'ako. However, this is likely a triangulation station used by surveyors for mapping, rather than a point marking the central section of Kaka'ako. Until the end of the 19th century, Kaka'ako was considered to be something of a wasteland, or empty space, between the better-known locations of Kou (modern-day Honolulu) and Waikk. Recent archaeological projects, associated with development and construction in the area, have documented several large cemeteries dating from the earlier historic period and perhaps late pre- Contact times. Otherwise, the place is known, and famous in a traditional sense, for its low-lying marshes, fishponds and salt making. It does not appear that the current project area was in an area of dense or permanent settlement in traditional times. Most of the pre-contact and early post-contact population was clustered in the village of Honuakaha, northwest of the current project area, or scattered adjacent to the main trails (i.e. Queen and King Streets), north of the current project area. However, in later post-contact times (post-1850), this changed, as population pressure in Honolulu and urban expansion led to the infilling of marshes and wetlands on the outskirts of Honolulu, and the subsequent development of the Kaka'ako area. Pohukaina School and Mother Waldron Park In the surveyor's notes for an 1873 map of land parcels at the corner of King and Punchbowl streets, the present site of the Hawai'i State Public Library, one of the parcels is identified as the \"lot purchased by the Government of Prince Lunalilo in 1872, said portion now to be transferred to the control of the Board of Education.\" The parcel was, in 1874, to become the site of the Pohukaina School for Girls, one of three government-supported schools on O'ahu during the second half of the 19th century. The other two schools were the Royal School for Boys and the Fort Street School. In 1907 the Hawai'i Territorial Legislature passed an act to establish the Library of Hawai'i. After evaluating several possible locations, the government committee decided that the King Street lot of the Pohukaina School would be the best location. Governor Frear wrote, \"I arranged to have Pohukaina School moved to Kakaako- a more central location with reference to its constituency and with much more space for buildings and playgrounds\" (Frear 1938, cited in Schilz 1991). As Gov. Frear noted, Pohukaina School was moved to Kaka'ako, within the city block bounded by Pohukaina Street, Keawe Street, Halekauwila Street, and Coral Street. The main building was located immediately makai (seaward) of the current project area. Constructed at a cost of $28,000, the new school building opened in 1913. FINAL ENVIRONMENTAL ASSESSMENT 30 HALEKAUWILA PLACE APRIL 2010 Pohukaina School remained in operation in Kaka'ako until 1980, by which time it had developed into a special education facility. The buildings were demolished, and in 1981, the Pohukaina School special education program was transferred to the campus of Kaimuk Intermediate School. One of the teachers at the Pohukaina School was Margaret Waldron. Mrs. Waldron taught at Pohukaina School for 18 years until her retirement in 1934. She was also noted for her volunteer work in Kaka'ako, and was \"generally credited with being the individual who had most influence in transforming the so-called 'Kakaako gangs' into law abiding groups and wiping out the unsavory reputation which at one time clung to the district\" (Honolulu Star-Bulletin; May 8, 1936:A1). Mrs. Waldron died on May 8, 1936. The following year, when a new playground was constructed across Coral Street from Pohukaina School, the Honolulu Board of Supervisors authorized the park's designation as \"Mother Waldron Playground.\" The playground, designed by Harry Sims Ben, was opened in September 20, 1937 on the site of the former County stables. It was constructed at a cost of $50,000. The Mother Waldron Playground was then, in 1937, the most modern facility in the Territory. The following year, Lewis Mumford, the noted author and social scientist, was invited by the Honolulu Park Board to study the county's parks and playgrounds. He noted the \"spirit called forth in the Mother Waldron Playground.\" Mumford defined that spirit exemplified by Mother Waldron Playground and other county parks. Development within the Current Project Area A series of fire insurance maps illustrates the history of the current project area in greater detail. The current project area is not shown on any of the Dakin Fire Insurance maps for 1891, 1899, or 1906, suggesting that there were no permanent structures in the area during those years. The current project area and vicinity is first indicated on the 1914 Sanborn Fire Insurance map. The 1914 map shows the project area within the mauka (northeastern) portion of the city block bounded by Keawe Street, 2nd Street (i.e. Pohukaina Street), Coral Street, and an unnamed lane (i.e. future Halekauwila Street). The block is dominated by the \"Pohukaina Public School,\" which occupies much of the makai (southwestern) portion of the block. The mauka portion of the block contains small residential \"dwellings,\" portions of which are located within the current project area. The 1927 Sanborn map continues to show the \"Pohukaina Public School\" dominating the block. The school has greatly expanded since 1914, with several classroom buildings surrounding the central school building. Several classrooms, an automobile garage, and water closet (i.e. restroom) are located within the current project area. The mauka portion of the block continues to be used for residential \"dwellings.\" By 1950, the \"Pohukaina Public School\" has expanded to cover the entire block, including the current project area. Several classroom buildings, an automobile FINAL ENVIRONMENTAL ASSESSMENT 31 HALEKAUWILA PLACE APRIL 2010 garage, and a portion of the school cafeteria building are located within the current project area. The 1956 Sanborn map continues to show the \"Pohukaina Public School\" in the same configuration as the 1950 map. As previously discussed, the Pohukaina School was closed in 1980 and the school buildings were subsequently demolished in 1981. Archaeological Background Most traditional Hawaiian surface structures in Honolulu had been demolished by the time of the first scientific archaeological surveys. In his report on the survey of O'ahu archaeological sites conducted in the early 1930s, McAllister (1933:80) says of Honolulu: \"Information regarding former sites within the present limits of Honolulu must come entirely from literary sources.\" The Kaka'ako district of Honolulu became a focus of archaeological work during the 1980s, impelled by the construction of local and federal government buildings and by the state-planned redevelopment of the area. Recent archaeological investigations have been conducted in parcels in the vicinity of the current project area and within road alignments near and adjacent to the project area. Summary of Archaeological Resources A total of 297 burials have been recorded in the Kaka'ako area from Punchbowl Street to Ward Avenue, including 257 from four historic cemeteries, three additional historic burials, and 37 scattered, possibly pre-contact burials. Based on the archaeological reports, it appears that all pre-contact human burials that have been encountered in the Kaka'ako area were buried in sandy deposits. In several cases, the pre-contact/early post-contact burials are located around or within former fishpond areas, such as: SIHP # -1604, four burials recorded in a area once covered by a pre- 1867 filled fishpond; SIHP # -4553, a single burial found in an area once covered by a fishpond owned by Queen Kapi'olani; and SIHP # -2963, 13 burials found adjacent to the former north shore of an 'Auwaiolimu 'Ili fishpond. In the eastern section of the Kaka'ako area, at the eastern extension of Queen Street, a nineteenth century cemetery (SIHP # -6658) was found along the lip of a former fishpond called Kolowalu. It is possible that the artificial earthen berms around fishponds were considered desirable places for burials. These earthen berms would have been higher than the surrounding easily-flooded coastal areas, and the soil of the built-up berms was probably easier to dig than undisturbed ground. In the Kaka'ako area between Punchbowl Street and Pi'ikoi Street, there are four historic cemeteries: Ka'kaukukui Cemetery (SIHP # 50-80-14-2918, 8 burials recorded, 5-8 disinterred), possibly utilized from the 1700s to the early 1800s; the Honuakaha Smallpox Cemetery (SIHP # -3712, 87 burials recorded, 62 disinterred), used from 1853-1854; a portion of Kawaiaha'o Cemetery (SIHP # -FINAL ENVIRONMENTAL ASSESSMENT 32 HALEKAUWILA PLACE APRIL 2010 4534, 129 burials recorded, 116 disinterred), used from 1875- 1920, and the King Street Roman Catholic Cemetery (SIHP # -5455, 33 burials estimated, three disinterred), used from the mid-1800s to the 1920s. The full extent of these cemeteries has not been determined, and there are likely hundreds of burials remaining in these cemeteries, within the modern cemetery boundaries or under modern structures. The burial at SIHP # -4532 is a known historic burial. At least 2 of the 9 burials in the Kaka'ako ID-3 area (SIHP # -5280) were historic (one coffin and one with historic grave goods). There is no historic documentation on this small historic burial area and its extent and time of use is unknown. The remaining 37 burials found in the Kaka'ako area west of Ward Avenue, at SIHP #s -1604 (4 individuals), -2963 (13), -4380 (9), -5280 (7), and 6371 (1) were not interred in coffins, do not have associated historic grave goods, or consist of partial, previously disturbed, burials. Some burials were found in a flexed position, a traditional Hawaiian burial practice. These may date to the pre-contact period or the early post-contact period (before the mid-nineteenth century), when most Hawaiians adopted Western style burial practices (usually extended within a coffin). Most of these burials cannot be assigned to a specific time period. The main early (nineteenth century) historic habitation area in the Kaka'ako area was within Honuakaha Village on both sides of Punchbowl Street at the junction with Queen Street. There was a second cluster of houselots near LCA 982 and the Pu'unui lot to Queen Emma. No intact early post-contact cultural layers have been recorded in these areas, due to extensive disturbance, but possible pre-contact/early post-contact burials are concentrated in these two areas. Also found within the Kaka'ako area west of Ward Avenue were historic deposits/ trash pits (SIHP # -1973, -3984, -6766, -9917, and -9991), which usually date around the last decades of the nineteenth to the early decades of the twentieth century. There are also several historic structures/properties with SIHP numbers, such as Kawaiaha'o Church and Mission grounds (SIHP # -9991), the Royal Brewery (SIHP # -9917), Mother Waldron Park (SIHP # -1388) and the old Kaka'ako Fire Station (SIHP # -1346). Previous Archaeological Work in the Current Project Area and Immediate Vicinity A review of reports currently on file at the State Historic Preservation Division (SHPD) indicates that no comprehensive archaeological studies of any portion of the current project area have been completed. However, in 1991 and 1992, during excavations for infrastructure improvements associated with the Hawai'i Community Development Authority project in Kaka'ako, eleven human burials were inadvertently exposed in the immediate vicinity of the project area. The FINAL ENVIRONMENTAL ASSESSMENT 33 HALEKAUWILA PLACE APRIL 2010 improvements included installation of a storm drain along Halekauwila Street, and installation of electric lines on Keawe Street and at the intersection of Halekauwila and Cooke streets. The fact that six of the burials were flexed (the position of 4 could not be determined and one was in an extended position) and the general absence of historic artifacts suggest that most (or all) of the burials were of a pre-contact date. Following consultation with the SHPD, all the burials were disinterred and curated by Cultural Surveys Hawai'i until they were returned to the SHPD in July of 1993. Subsequently, the burials were reinterred at a specially constructed site at the corner of Halekauwila and Cooke streets; the reinterment was coordinated by the burial administrator of the SHPD. According to a memorandum of July 2, 1993 from the HCDA to the SHPD burial administrator, the reinterment site at the corner of Halekauwila and Cooke streets comprised \"site A [to] be utilized for Improvement Districts 1 and 3 burials.\" The memorandum also designates the corner of Cooke and Pohukaina streets, as \"site B [which] will be reserved for future reinterments.\" Background Summary and Predictive Model Background research indicates a low intensity of use in the vicinity of the current project area in pre-contact and early post contact times. Adjacent areas to the west were marshy into the 1880s and this may have restricted the early use and development of Kaka'ako to areas to the north and east of the current project area. Coral Street, forming the southeast side of the project area, was slowly established as a major mauka/makai artery for Kaka'ako in the mid 1880s and 1890s. Kaka'ako grew rapidly in the first decades of the twentieth century. The large Pohukaina School was re-established on a new campus just seaward of the current project area in 1913. A variety of \"dwellings\" were present on the mauka side of the project area by 1914. By 1927, Pohukaina School had expanded into the project area and covered the entire block by 1950. Classroom buildings were aligned along Keawe, Coral, and Halekauwila streets, arranged around the perimeter of the current project area. Structures then present within the present project area included seven classrooms, a cafeteria and a couple of small storage structures. The school continued to dominate the project area until it was demolished in 1980. Since then, the current project area has been used as a public parking lot. The historic record would suggest only remnants of turn of the twentieth century habitation and school related finds in the time frame of 1913 to 1980. However, the archaeological record suggests a somewhat different picture. The identification of three burials near the intersection of Halekauwila and Keawe streets and 8 burials near the intersection of Coral and Halekauwila streets (both addressed in Winieski and Hammatt 2000), clearly suggests a pattern of pre-contact human interment in the vicinity. FINAL ENVIRONMENTAL ASSESSMENT 34 HALEKAUWILA PLACE APRIL 2010 Survey Findings The project area is almost entirely asphalt-paved and is currently used as a parking lot. No surface structures are present within the project area, with the exception of a modern portable trailer used by the Honolulu Police Department as a substation. Test Excavation Findings Subsurface testing consisted of the excavation of 18 test trenches within the project. Test trenches were distributed throughout the project area to provide representative coverage and assess the stratigraphy and potential for subsurface cultural resources. Test trenches generally measured 6 m long and were excavated approximately 2 m deep, terminating at the surface of the coral shelf. The stratigraphic sequence generally consisted of three to five layers (i.e. Stratum I and Stratum II) of historic and modern fill material beneath the modern asphalt pavement and gravel base course. The natural sediment layers (Stratum III) were generally encountered at depths approximately 0.9-1.3 m below the current land surface, within approximately 0.5-1.0 m of the water table. Stratum I includes historic and modern fill materials, subdivided into sub-strata based on differences in soil composition. Stratum I generally consisted of mixed terrigenous fill material in the upper sub-strata, and crushed-coral fill material in the lower sub-strata. Construction debris and abandoned utilities were observed within Stratum I. Excavation features were observed in the upper fill layers of Trenches 1-3, 8, 9, 11, and 15. The features consist mainly of a mix of fill strata with utility and foundation remnants, and are likely related to historic and modern construction/demolition events of the former Pohukaina School. Stratum II includes a layer of ash and burnt garbage, and layers of sandy clay fill material. The layer of burnt garbage and ash is interpreted to be fill material generated by the city's municipal garbage incinerator that was formerly located in the Kaka'ako area. Diagnostic artifacts, consisting primarily of glass bottles, were analyzed (see Section 5: Results of Laboratory Analysis), dating the layer to the late 1800s and early 1900s. The sandy clay layers are interpreted to be fill material generated by the dredging of Honolulu Harbor and other coastal areas in the vicinity. The dredge material was also used to fill the low-lying marsh areas of Kakaako in the late 1800s and early 1900s. Stratum III includes the natural sandy clay and gleyed clay sediments underlying the historic and modern fill layers. Stratum III generally consisted of a pale brown sandy clay over a gleyed sandy clay. The gleyed sandy clay was located at or near the water table. The Stratum III sediments are typical of a wet, marsh-type environment. No significant cultural material was observed through the subsurface testing program. FINAL ENVIRONMENTAL ASSESSMENT 35 HALEKAUWILA PLACE APRIL 2010 Summary and Interpretation The current project area is located in Ka'kaukukui 'Ili, within the greater area now known as Kaka'ako. Background research indicates a low intensity of use in the vicinity of the current project area in pre-contact and early post contact times. The area was generally low-lying and marshy. Kaka'ako was considered outside the Honolulu town boundary and was used in the mid to late 1800s as a place for cemeteries, burial grounds, and for the quarantine of contagious patients. From pre-contact times into the early 1900s, the land in Ka'kaukukui was also used to produce salt. Major land reclamation projects of the late 1800s and early 1900s transformed the low-lying marsh lands into dry land for the expanding urban Honolulu area. Kaka'ako grew rapidly in the first decades of the twentieth century. Development in the immediate vicinity of the current project area began circa 1913, with the construction of the Pohukaina School. A variety of residential \"dwellings\" were present within the project area by 1914. By 1927, Pohukaina School had expanded into the project area and covered the entire block by 1950. Classroom buildings were aligned along Keawe, Coral, and Halekauwila streets, arranged around the perimeter of the current project area. Pohukaina School was present within the project area until it was demolished in 1980. Following the demolition of the school, the project area was paved over and has been used as a public parking lot. The findings of the current archaeological assessment study are consistent with expectations based on background research. No surface structures are present within the project area. Subsurface testing revealed several historic and modern fill layers overlying the natural sediments. The natural sandy clay sediments are typical of a wet, marsh-type environment. Fill layers overlying the natural sediments included a layer of ash and burnt garbage, interpreted to be fill material generated by the city's municipal garbage incinerator, and layers of sandy clay, interpreted to be fill material generated by the dredging of Honolulu Harbor and other coastal areas in the vicinity. The presence of the dredge fill material and incinerator fill material is consistent with background research of Kaka'ako land reclamation projects in the late 1800s and early 1900s. The upper terrigenous fill layers included construction debris and abandoned utilities, evidence of the former Pohukaina School. No significant cultural material was encountered through the subsurface tesing program. However, the archaeological record, including the identification of three burials near the intersection of Halekauwila and Keawe streets and 8 burials near the intersection of Coral and Halekauwila streets (both addressed in Winieski and Hammatt 2000), clearly suggests a pattern of pre-contact human interment in the vicinity. FINAL ENVIRONMENTAL ASSESSMENT 36 HALEKAUWILA PLACE APRIL 2010 Project Effect and Mitigation Recommendations The following project effect discussion and cultural resource management recommendations are intended to facilitate project planning and support the project's required historic preservation consultation. This discussion is based on the results of this archaeological assessment and CSH's communication with agents for the project proponents regarding the project's potential impacts to historic properties. The proposed Halekauwila Place Project consists of development of a mixed-income urban housing community, including: a 19-story residential tower with ground-level retail and meeting spaces; multi-family residential units; and a multi-level parking garage with ground-level retail spaces. Minimally, land disturbing activities would include: grubbing and grading; excavations for building foundations and subsurface utilities; and associated infrastructure improvements. The proposed project's area of potential effect (APE) is defined as the entire 1.25-acre project area. No historic properties were identified during the current archaeological assessment study. However, based on background research, including the previous identification of human skeletal remains in the immediate vicinity of the project area, there is potential for encountering human skeletal remains within the natural sandy clay-type sediments underlying fill material in the project area. Due to the potential adverse effect on significant historic properties within the project's APE, specifically inadvertent burial discoveries, CSH's project-specific effect recommendation is \"effect, with proposed mitigation commitments.\" The recommended mitigation measures will reduce the project's potential adverse effect to significant historic properties. To reduce the proposed project's potential adverse effect on significant historic properties, the following mitigation measures are recommended. The mitigation measures should be completed prior to any land disturbing activities associated with the proposed Halekauwila Place Project. 1. Archaeological monitoring is recommended during all land disturbing activities within the project area. Archaeological monitoring will ensure proper treatment and documentation should any historic properties be discovered during project-related construction activities. 2. An archaeological monitoring plan should be prepared for review and approval of the State Historic Preservation Divison (SHPD) prior to project construction. In accordance with HAR 13-279, the monitoring plan should detail specific archaeological monitoring provisions. FINAL ENVIRONMENTAL ASSESSMENT 37 HALEKAUWILA PLACE APRIL 2010 3.4.4 CULTURAL ASSESSMENT A study titled Cultural Assessment of the Former Waldron Playground/Former Pohukaina School Parcel (6.8 Acres) in the Kaka'ako District of Honolulu, Island of O'ahu was prepared by Cultural Surveys Hawaii (CSH) in July 2001. Portions of the previous section have been synthesized for the Cultural Assessment. In addition to the archaeological and historic research conducted for the project, CSH placed a greater emphasis into consultation efforts rather than replicating the existing archival and historical reseach. Letters requesting (1) identification of cultural concerns and (2) referrals of knowledgeable individuals were written to the following organizations: the State Historic Preservation Division, the Office of Hawaiian Affairs, the Oahu Island Burial Council, Hui Malama I Na Kupuna o Hawaii Nei and Kamehameha Schools Bishop Estate. An attempt was made to contact all the individuals referred by the various organizations, either by letter and/or telephone. A complete list of organizations and individuals contacted during the consultation period can be found in the appended report. In consultation with the SHPD Culture/History Branch, it was determined that the consultation process need not be as broad as originally intended due to several factors: 1) the Kakaako area previously consisted of fish ponds and tidal flats and were not subject to intertidal influences; 2) the soil in the project area is Fill (FL); 3) the project area is in a developed and previously disturbed area; 4) due to development of the commercial and business district, the original homes were torn down in the last 10-15 years and the once tight-knit community dispersed and relocated elsewhere. The consultation portion of the study did not identify any traditional cultural practices occurring in the project area nor identify any cultural concerns. Nearly everyone contacted had only peripheral knowledge of the subject parcel. Two of the people consulted know Mother Waldron and were able to add some personal information regarding her life. 3.4.5 TRAFFIC CONDITIONS A Traffic Impact Assessment Study was conducted by Wilson Okamoto Corporation for the proposed project. The study, titled Traffic Impact Report for Halekauwila Place, is summarized in this section and included in its entirety as Appendix B. The study was completed in October of 2009.

Along Halekauwila Street, the northbound approach of the intersection with Cooke Street is expected to operate at a slightly lower LOS \"B\" during the AM peak period while the westbound and northbound approaches of the intersection with Keawe Street are expected to operate at a slightly lower LOS \"B\" during the PM peak period. The remaining critical traffic movements at these intersections, as well as, the other study intersections are expected to continue operating at levels of service similar to without project conditions. 3.4.5.3 RECOMMENDATIONS AND CONCLUSION Based on the analysis of the traffic data, the following are the recommendations of this study to be incorporated in the project design. Maintain sufficient sight distance for motorists to safely enter and exit all project driveways. Parking along Halekauwila Street and Keawe Street fronting the project site may need to be restricted to ensure that sufficient sight distances are maintained. Provide adequate on-site loading and off-loading service areas and prohibit off-site loading operations. Provide adequate turn-around area for service, delivery, and refuse collection vehicles to maneuver on the project site to avoid vehicle-reversing maneuvers onto public roadways. Provide sufficient turning radii at all project driveways to avoid or minimize vehicle encroachments to oncoming traffic lanes. Provide sufficient storage for entering vehicles at the parking garage access control (i.e., automatic gate, etc.) to ensure that queues do not extend onto the adjacent public roadway. FINAL ENVIRONMENTAL ASSESSMENT 43 HALEKAUWILA PLACE APRIL 2010 The proposed Halekauwila Place development includes approximately 204 affordable rental units with a parking garage and amenities. In addition, the development will include some office space for Honolulu Police Department staff to replace the existing portable trailer they are currently utilizing within the project site. Despite the anticipated increases in traffic along the surrounding roadways due to the proposed project, the traffic movements at the study intersections are anticipated to continue operating at levels-of-service similar to without project conditions during both peak periods. As such, with the implementation of the aforementioned recommendations, the proposed Halekauwila Place development is not expected to have a significant impact on traffic operations in the vicinity. 3.4.6 AIR QUALITY B.D. Neal & Associates conducted an Air Quality Impact Assessment on the proposed project in November 2009. A summary from this report is provided below. The report can be found in its entirety in Appendix C. The study's findings were modeled for project completion in 2012. 3.4.6.1 AMBIENT AIR QUALITY STANDARDS Both federal and state standards have been established to maintain ambient air quality. At the present time, seven parameters are regulated including: particulate matter, sulfur dioxide, hydrogen sulfide, nitrogen dioxide, carbon monoxide, ozone and lead. Hawaii air quality standards are comparable to the national standards except those for nitrogen dioxide and carbon monoxide which are more stringent than the national standards. 3.4.6.2 REGIONAL AND LOCAL CLIMATOLOGY Regional and local climate together with the amount and type of human activity generally dictate the air quality of a given location. Winds are predominantly trade winds which are deviated somewhat from the northeast toward the east or southeast by the local terrain. During winter, occasional storms may generate strong winds from the south (kona winds) for brief periods. When the trade winds or kona winds are weak or absent, landbreeze- seabreeze circulations may develop. Wind speeds are often lower compared to more exposed coastal locations, but the trade winds still provide relatively good ventilation much of the time. Temperatures in the Oahu area leeward of the Koolaus are generally very moderate with average daily temperatures ranging from about 70\u00b0F to 84\u00b0F. Extreme temperatures range from about 53\u00b0F to about 95\u00b0F. Rainfall is relatively low with an average of about 22 inches per year. 3.4.6.3 EXISTING AIR QUALITY CONDITIONS Air quality in the vicinity of the project presently is mostly affected by emissions from FINAL ENVIRONMENTAL ASSESSMENT 44 HALEKAUWILA PLACE APRIL 2010 vehicular sources which emit carbon monoxide, nitrogen oxides, hydrocarbons and other air pollutants. Air quality data from the nearest monitoring stations operated by the Hawaii Department of Health suggest that all state and national air quality standards are currently being met in the downtown Honolulu area. 3.4.6.4 AIR QUALITY IMPACTS OF PROJECT Short-term direct and indirect impacts on air quality could potentially occur during project construction. For a project of this nature, there are two potential types of air pollution emissions that could directly result in short-term air quality impacts during project construction: (1) fugitive dust from soil excavation, aggregate processing and vehicle movement; and (2) exhaust emissions from on-site construction equipment. Indirectly, there also could be short-term air quality impacts from the disruption of traffic on nearby roadways, from slow- moving construction equipment traveling to and from the project site, and from a temporary increase in local traffic caused by commuting construction workers. Fugitive dust emissions from construction activities are difficult to estimate accurately because of their elusive nature of emission and because the potential for dust generation varies greatly depending upon the type of soil at the construction site, the amount and type of dirt-disturbing activity taking place, the moisture content of exposed soil in work areas, and the wind speed. The U.S. EPA has provided a rough estimate for uncontrolled fugitive dust emissions from construction activity of 1.2 tons per acre per month under conditions of \"medium\" activity, moderate soil silt content (30%), and precipitation/ evaporation (P/E) index of 50. Uncontrolled fugitive dust emissions from project construction would likely be somewhere near this level. In any case, State of Hawaii Air Pollution Control Regulations prohibit visible emissions of fugitive dust from construction activities at the project property line. Thus, an effective dust control plan for the project construction phase should be prepared. Adequate fugitive dust control can usually be accomplished by the establishment of a frequent watering program to keep bare-dirt surfaces in active construction areas from becoming significant sources of dust. On days without rainfall, construction areas should be watered at least twice during the workday to help keep dust to a minimum. Control regulations further stipulate that open-bodied trucks be covered at all times when in motion if they are transporting materials likely to give rise to airborne dust. Haul trucks tracking dirt onto paved streets from unpaved areas are oftentimes a significant source of dust in construction areas. Some means to alleviate this problem, such as tire washing or road cleaning, may be appropriate. Dust monitoring could be considered as a means to quantitatively evaluate the effectiveness of dust control measures. On-site mobile and stationary construction equipment also will emit air pollutants from engine exhausts. The largest of this equipment is usually diesel-powered. Nitrogen oxides emissions from diesel engines can be relatively high compared to gasoline- powered equipment, but the standard for nitrogen dioxide is set on an annual basis and is not likely to be violated by short-term construction equipment emissions. Carbon FINAL ENVIRONMENTAL ASSESSMENT 45 HALEKAUWILA PLACE APRIL 2010 monoxide emissions from diesel engines, on the other hand, are low and should be relatively insignificant compared to vehicular emissions on nearby roadways. Indirectly, slow-moving construction vehicles on roadways leading to and from the project site could obstruct the normal flow of traffic to such an extent that overall vehicular emissions increase. This impact can be mitigated by moving heavy construction equipment during periods of low traffic volume. Likewise, the schedules of commuting construction workers can be adjusted to avoid peak hours in the project vicinity. After the period of construction, long-term impacts on air quality from motor vehicle exhausts can potentially occur at or near any project that attracts large volumes of motor vehicle traffic. Carbon monoxide emissions are usually the primary issue, and public areas near traffic-congested intersections are the main concern. Primary access to the project will be provided via driveways off Halekauwila Street between Cooke Street and Keawe Street with a secondary driveway providing access to a loading area off Keawe Street between Halekauwila Street and Pohukaina Street. The project traffic study examined six nearby roadway intersections along Halekauwila Street and Pohukaina Street. These included Halekauwila Street at Cooke Street, Halekauwila Street at Coral Street, Halekauwila Street at Keawe Street, Pohukaina Street at Keawe Street, Pohukaina Street at Coral Street, and Pohukaina Street at Cooke Street. The project traffic study indicates that with the project, peak-hour traffic volumes at these intersections would likely increase by about 5 percent or less except at the intersection of Coral Street and Halekauwila Street where an increase of about 11 to 12 percent would occur (which is a maximum traffic increase of 61 vehicles per hour during the afternoon peak hour). The traffic study also indicates that traffic level-of-service at these intersections is presently good and that by the year 2012, with or without the project, traffic level-of-service conditions would remain essentially unchanged. 3.4.6.5 AIR QUALITY CONCLUSIONS AND RECOMMENDATIONS Based on extensive experience in assessing traffic-related air quality impacts, traffic volume increases of less than about 5 percent or less than about 100 vehicles per hour and traffic approach volumes of less than about 1,000 vehicles per hour do not cause any significant impacts on air quality if adequate traffic level-of-service is provided. The project traffic study indicates that traffic volumes in the project area should remain well within these criteria. Considering the small project- related traffic volumes that are expected, traffic from the proposed project should have no measurable long-term impacts on air pollution levels in the project area. Although a detailed air quality modeling study could be performed to quantitatively predict project impacts, such an analysis is probably unwarranted. In summary, short-term impacts from fugitive dust during project construction may potentially occur. Because of this, an effective dust control plan for the period of construction should be prepared and implemented. After construction, any long-term FINAL ENVIRONMENTAL ASSESSMENT 46 HALEKAUWILA PLACE APRIL 2010 impacts on air quality from motor vehicle traffic related to this project will likely be negligible. 3.4.7 NOISE ENVIRONMENT Y. Ebisu & Associates prepared a revised report titled Acoustic Study for the Halekauwila Place Project Kakaako, Oahu in October 2009. The report is summarized in the following section and is included in its entirety as Appendix D of this report. This study was modeled for project completion in year 2012. 3.4.7.1 EXISTING ACOUSTICAL ENVIRONMENT The existing background ambient noise levels within the project area are controlled by traffic along Cooke, Pohukaina, Halekauwila, and Keawe Streets; by local traffic within the existing parking lot; and by interisland and military jet aircraft departures from Honolulu International Airport. Traffic, aircraft, and background ambient noise measurements were obtained at six locations in the project environs. Aircraft noise level measurements were obtained in 2000 and 2009. In 2000, the loudest aircraft noise events were typically associated with departures by interisland jet aircraft. Occasionally, departures by the louder military jet aircraft (such as the F-15) were also audible and measurable. Aircraft noise events were typically louder than motor vehicles, and were audible over longer periods than other noise events. Nevertheless, aircraft noise levels at the project site did not exceed 60 Ldn in 2000, which is the level above which the Hawaii State Department of Transportation, Airports Division, considers to be unacceptable for residences. By 2009, the B-737 and DC-9 jet aircraft formerly used for interisland passenger service had been replaced by quieter CRJ 200 and B-717 (200) aircraft, so aircraft noise in the project area have been reduced by at least 3 Ldn units. Because of the modernization of the interisland passenger jet aircraft, aircraft noise is not a major contributor to the noise environment at the project site. The existing traffic noise levels in the project environs along Cooke Street are in the \"Moderate Exposure, Acceptable\" category and less than 65 Ldn within 50 feet of the roadway's centerline. Along Halekauwila, Pohukaina, and Keawe Streets, existing traffic noise levels are also in the \"Moderate Exposure, Acceptable\" category at 50 feet or greater distance from the roadways' centerlines. The traffic, aircraft, and background ambient noise level measurements indicated that total noise levels are between 60 to 62 Ldn on the project site in the vicinity of the proposed residential tower. Aircraft noise levels are approximately 55 to 58 Ldn, while traffic noise levels range from approximately 55 to 62 Ldn at ground level to 59 to 60 Ldn at receptor elevations of 43 feet or more above ground level. Traffic noise levels increase with receptor elevation due to the decrease in noise shielding effects and the reduction of excess ground attenuation effects. Results of calculations of existing (CY 2009) traffic noise levels at the future residential FINAL ENVIRONMENTAL ASSESSMENT 47 HALEKAUWILA PLACE APRIL 2010 tower building on the project site indicate that the existing noise levels over the project site are higher near Halekauwila Street (along the north side of the project site), and are lower near the south side of the project site. Existing traffic and aircraft noise levels, singly and in combination, do not exceed 65 Ldn, and existing noise levels are considered to be \"Acceptable\" for residences by FHA/HUD and other federal agencies. 3.4.7.2 FUTURE NOISE ENVIRONMENT Predictions of future traffic noise levels were made using the traffic volume assignments for CY 2012 with and without the proposed project. Essentially no significant changes in traffic noise levels are expected in the project environs between CY 2009 and 2012, with or without the project. With the construction of the proposed garage and residential tower buildings, traffic noise levels along the east and south faces of the tower building should decrease due to the shielding of the traffic noise contributions from Halekauwila and Keawe Streets. Except for noise shielding effects from the project's tower building, future traffic noise levels should be nearly identical with or without the proposed housing project. The dominant traffic noise source in the project area will continue to be traffic noise from Halekauwila, Cooke, Keawe, and Pohukaina Streets, but the changes in traffic noise levels following project build-out are not expected to be significant. The elevated residential units in the tower building are expected to be exposed to traffic noise levels less than 65 Ldn, and are expected to be in the \"Acceptable\" noise exposure category in respect to the FHA/HUD noise standard for residences. Aircraft noise levels over the project site are not expected to change significantly between CY 2009 and 2012, and should remain at or below the current levels of 55 to 58 Ldn. The future changes in aircraft noise levels over the project site will be more dependent upon the future changes in military jet aircraft operations rather than upon the future changes in civilian jet aircraft operations at Honolulu International Airport. This is because the composite civilian jet aircraft fleet has become quieter in recent times, while the composite military jet aircraft fleet has not. The Noise and Vibration Technical Report for the Honolulu High-Capacity Transit Corridor Project indicates that noise levels from the Honolulu Fixed Guideway System could range between 56 to 61 Ldn from ground level to the 6th floor level at the 860 Halekauwila Street and, by analogy, also at the Halekauwila Place project. From the 7th to the 13th floors, rail system noise levels are predicted to range from 65 to 69 Ldn. Above the 13th floor, rail system noise levels decline from 64 to 61 Ldn or less. These noise level predictions assumed that wheel skirts and sound attenuation walls were incorporated into the Honolulu Fixed Guideway System as noise mitigation measures. However, because the sound attenuation walls are not effective at elevated receptor locations above the 6th floor level, both the FHA/HUD and Federal Transit Administration noise impact criteria will probably be exceeded along portions of the north, west, and east tower faces of the Halekauwila Place project. FINAL ENVIRONMENTAL ASSESSMENT 48 HALEKAUWILA PLACE APRIL 2010 3.4.7.3 DISCUSSION OF PROJECT-RELATED NOISE AND VIBRATION IMPACTS AND POSSIBLE MITIGATION MEASURES Traffic Noise For the residential units in the proposed residential tower building, traffic noise mitigation measures should not be required for traffic noise projected through year 2012. Noise impacts from project related traffic along the surrounding roadways which are expected to service the project are not expected due to the very low levels of traffic noise associated with project traffic. General Construction Noise Audible construction noise will probably be unavoidable during the entire project construction period. The total time period for construction is estimated to be 18 to 24 months, but it is anticipated that the actual work will be moving from one location on the project site to another during that period. Actual length of exposure to construction noise at any receptor location will probably be less than the total construction period for the entire project. Direct line-of-sight distances from the construction equipment to existing residential and commercial buildings will range from 70 FT to 450 FT, with corresponding average noise levels of 83 to 65 dBA (plus or minus 5 dBA). For receptors along a cross-street, the construction noise level should be reduced by approximately 8 dBA when the work is occurring at the intersection with the cross street, and should be reduced by 15 dBA when work is occurring at least 100 FT from the intersection (and the visual line-of-sight is blocked by intervening buildings). Typical levels of construction noise inside naturally ventilated and air-conditioned structures are approximately 10 and 20 dB less. The business offices, produce business, and elderly housing facility across Halekauwila Street are predicted to experience the highest noise levels during construction activities due to their close proximity to the construction site. Adverse impacts from construction noise are not expected to be in the \"public health and welfare\" category due to the temporary nature of the work, the business/commercial character of the neighborhood, and due to the administrative controls available for regulation of construction noise. Instead, these impacts will probably be limited to the temporary degradation of the quality of the acoustic environment in the immediate vicinity of the project site. Mitigation of construction noise to inaudible levels will not be practical in all cases due to the intensity of construction noise sources (80 to 90+ dB at 50 FT distance), and due to the exterior nature of the work (pile driving, grading and earth moving, trenching, concrete pouring, hammering, etc.). The use of properly muffled construction equipment should be required on the job site. FINAL ENVIRONMENTAL ASSESSMENT 49 HALEKAUWILA PLACE APRIL 2010 Peak airborne noise levels from pile diving may be as much as 15 dBA greater than noise levels for non-impulsive (steady) construction noise sources. Although the pile driving can produce more intense noise levels, each pulse is of short individual duration (less than one second). Therefore, its impact on speech communication is not as severe as that of steady source of the same noise level. Severe noise impacts are not expected to occur inside air-conditioned structures which are within 70 to 450 FT of the project construction site. Inside naturally ventilated structures, interior noise levels (with windows or doors opened) are estimated to range between 55 to 73 dBA at 70 FT to 450 FT distances from the construction site. Closure of all doors and windows facing the construction site would generally reduce interior noise levels by an additional 5 to 10 dBA. The incorporation of State Department of Health construction noise limits and curfew times, which are applicable throughout the State of Hawaii, is another noise mitigation measure which is normally applied to construction activities. Noisy construction activities are not allowed on Sundays and holidays, during the early morning, and during the late evening and nighttime periods under the DOH permit procedures. Vibration from Pile Driving Pile driving will probably be necessary to implant piles into the ground over the project site. Impact driven concrete and sheet piles may both be used on the project site. Induced ground vibrations from the pile driving operations have the potential to cause architectural and structural damage to structures. Ground vibrations generated during pile driving operations are generally described in terms of peak particle (or ground) velocity in units of inches/second. The human being is very sensitive to ground vibrations, which are perceptible at relatively low particle velocities of 0.01 to 0.04 inches/second. Damage to structures, however, occur at much higher levels of vibration. The most commonly used damage criteria for structures is the 2.0 inches/second limit derived from work by the U.S. Bureau of Mines. A more conservative limit of 0.2 inches/second is also used, and is suggested for planning purposes on this project because of the repetitive nature of pile driving operations which can increase risks of damage due to fatiguing. Predictions of peak ground vibration levels vs. scaled energy distance factor from the driven pile are not precise, with initial uncertainty factor for a given location in the order of 10:1. For this reason, it is standard practice to employ seismograph monitoring of ground vibrations during pile driving operations with a 3-axis geophone or accelerometer. If sheet pile drivers of approximately 2,500 foot-pounds or smaller ratings are anticipated to be used on the job site, the initial vibration predictions indicate that there is some risk of exceeding the 0.2 inches/second vibration damage criteria at 47 to 71 FT separation distances, and FINAL ENVIRONMENTAL ASSESSMENT 50 HALEKAUWILA PLACE APRIL 2010 monitoring during pile driving operations is warranted if pile driving are planned at those distances from any existing structures. For pile driver operations, risks of damage to the buildings across Halekauwila Street are considered to be very low. The following preventative measures are recommended for implementation during the planning and design phases of the project: In addition to the normal planning and design concerns regarding potential damage due to settling and heaving during construction, consideration should also be given to risks of damage due to vibration from pile driving. A damage criteria of 0.2 inches/second should be used in conjunction with the vibration prediction method of the Highway Research Record \"Damage to Pile Driving Vibration\" report to identify the potential damage risk distances to the driven piles. If predicted vibration levels from pile driving exceed 0.2 inches/second at a building, and predicted levels cannot be reduced by sizing of the pile driver, test piles should be driven and their vibrations monitored and recorded prior to completion of the foundation design. The monitoring of the test piles should be designed to measure the expected peak, 3-axis vibration levels at the building. The results of the monitoring should be used to define empirical distance from the driven pile to the 0.2 inches/second damage risk location, and to evaluate the risks of structural damage to the adjacent structure during actual construction. If predicted vibration levels from pile driving exceed 2.0 inches/second at a building, the use of alternate types of piles or shoring should be considered for implementation during the design phase. Honolulu Fixed Guideway System Noise. The Halekauwila Place living units are not planned to be air-conditioned, so noise mitigation measures will not be included in the project plans. However, wall openings in the living units will be provided for the addition of air conditioning units by the building's occupants. If the Halekauwila Place project is completed prior to the completion of the Honolulu Fixed Guideway System, it is possible that noise mitigation measures at Halekauwila Place may be incorporated into the Honolulu Fixed Guideway System project. So the mitigation of potential noise impacts from the Honolulu Fixed Guideway System will be deferred to the rail project. 3.4.8 BIOLOGICAL CHARACTERISTICS 3.4.8.1 FLORA The project lot is presently covered with asphalt paving. Seven monkey pod trees remain on-site along the perimeter of the lot. A particularly large specimen is located along the Keawe Street boundary. No rare or endangered species of flora were identified on the site. Six trees must be removed or relocated. FINAL ENVIRONMENTAL ASSESSMENT 51 HALEKAUWILA PLACE APRIL 2010 3.4.8.2 FAUNA The site does not serve as a wildlife habitat although avifauna, feral cats, dogs and rodents may be found on-site. 3.4.9 INFRASTRUCTURE AND UTILITIES The proposed improvements are readily serviced by existing utilities located in the immediate vicinity. All utilities are presently located underground largely through the Kakaako district improvements that were recently completed. 3.4.9.1 POTABLE WATER The project will continue to be serviced by the existing water system that the Board of Water Supply has determined to be adequate to accommodate the proposed project. Use of this service will increase significantly from current levels as a result of the project but can be readily accommodated by the existing water system. Water conservation efforts are likely to be implemented by the project operator upon completion. 3.4.9.2 STORMWATER The site is presently naturally drained. The proposed project will be required to control drainage according to prevailing drainage regulations. Stormwater lines in the area were installed in 1990-1991 and are adequate to service the project site. All storm water runoff from the proposed improvements will be reviewed for conformance with City and County of Honolulu Ordinance 96-34 regarding peak runoff. The entire district has been improved for future development and fully supports both existing and future runoff potential. Both during and after construction, the project will observe Best Management Practices (BMP) in accordance with the City's Rules Relating to Strom Drainage Standards. 3.4.9.3 WASTEWATER The Department of Planning and Permitting has determined that the municipal sewer system is adequate to accommodate the proposed project. 3.4.9.4 SOLID WASTE It is expected that private refuse collection service will be used to service the project location. The project operator may implement recycling programs upon project completion. The Department of Health has indicated that recycled paving material should be used if available at acceptable prices and that solid waste generated during the project's construction should be directed to a permitted solid waste disposal, processing or recycling facility. FINAL ENVIRONMENTAL ASSESSMENT 52 HALEKAUWILA PLACE APRIL 2010 3.4.9.5 TELEPHONE AND ELECTRICAL SERVICES Telephone and electrical services are available to the site. Coordination with the local electric and telephone service providers will be expected during the design and construction phases. 3.4.10 PUBLIC FACILITIES The proposed project is not expected to have any significant impact on existing public facilities including schools, parks, police, and fire or emergency medical services. Accommodation for a future inner city public elementary school as part of the project block has been evaluated as part of a master plan effort by HCDA. In consultation with the Department of Education (DOE), it was determined that the conceptual design for this project can co-exist with the DOE space requirements for an \"inner city\" public elementary school. There are no immediate plans for DOE development of the site at this time. The location of a school site adjacent to the proposed project is considered acceptable by the HCDA. Within the highly urban Kakaako community, school, park and senior housing uses are all considered high priority items and do not require the exclusion of other uses to maintain viability of the project block. School use adjacent to the project site will result in significantly higher levels of activity including traffic, noise and use of park space in the general vicinity. The proposed housing project will remain secured from the school site and housing residents are not likely to access the school site nor is it likely that students will enter the housing site. School related noise, particularly during recesses or after school may intrude onto the housing site. Noise attenuation measures, including air conditioning may be provided by the developer to mitigate noise intrusion. The proposed project is also adjacent to the Mother Waldron Park, which is listed in the Hawaii Register of Historic Places. The proposed project will not have any physical impact on the park site, however residents of the project may use the site slightly increasing park activity. This additional demand is partially offset by the addition of a community meeting room on the ground floor of the Halekauwila Place project. This area will support community functions that may otherwise be held in other public park facilities. The Draft Mauka Area Plan for Kakaako also proposes to improve four \"green\" streets to enhance their existing links to adjoining parks and open space outside of the Mauka Area. Street Conditions, as well as landscaping on these streets will be improved with the ultimate goal of promoting walking and bicycling not just as environmentally friendly and cost effective modes of travel, but also as a form of outdoor recreation and exercise that promotes a healthy lifestyle. One of the \"green\" streets proposed is Cooke Street, which borders Mother Waldron Neighborhood Park and provides a connection from the Pauahi neighborhood to the entry to Kakaako Waterfront Park. FINAL ENVIRONMENTAL ASSESSMENT 53 HALEKAUWILA PLACE APRIL 2010 The project is also located next to a possible future elementary school site. The school was included in a conceptual planning process in 1998 but no commitments to the development of the school have been made. The Department of Education has indicated that it has no objections to the proposed housing project based on conceptual school schemes prepared for the makai portion of the block. 3.4.10.1 FIRE PROTECTION Kakaako Fire Station Number 9 provides fire protection service to the project area as well as emergency medical service. The station is located at 555 Queen Street and is located two blocks from the project site. Response time to the site is less than 5 minutes. 3.4.10.2 POLICE SERVICE Police service is provided by the Honolulu Police Department (HPD) Beats Number 167 and 168. The project block currently houses a trailer used by beat officers as an informal substation used for report writing and communications. Response time to the site is less than 5 minutes. 3.4.10.3 PUBLIC TRANSPORTATION AND HONOLULU HIGH-CAPACITY TRANSIT CORRIDOR PROJECT Public transportation by TheBus is available along Queen Street, approximately 500-feet from the project site along either Keawe Street or Coral Street. Bus stops are located both mauka and makai of Queen Street near the Queen Street/Emily Street intersection. These stops are located along Route 6 - Pauoa Valley/UH Woodlawn. The Honolulu High-Capacity Transit Corridor Project often referred to as the Rail Transit project, is proposed for alignment along Halekauwila Street. This alignment will be within the immediate vicinity of the proposed Halekauwila Place project. This elevated system will front the mauka side of the project at approximately the 40-foot elevation. This is a visual impact to units facing the mauka direction located at or below this elevation. As stated in the Noise Impact section of this report, noise impacts are expected to be within the acceptable range. Furthermore, it is the responsibility of the City and County of Honolulu to ensure that any noise concerns that may arise from the Rail Transit project are mitigated to acceptable levels. This mitigation may include the possibility of the City installing air-conditioning units for affected units. The Kakaako transit station will be conveniently located one block Ewa of the project site. The proposed Halekauwila Place project and the Honolulu High-Capacity Transit Corridor Project are mutually beneficial. A reliable high capacity transit system along with a range of housing choices will encourage residents to reduce their dependence on individual automobiles. The Halekauwila Place project also supports Transit Oriented Development (TOD) by providing relatively high-density housing in a convenient location near the proposed Halekauwila transit station. TOD is designed to maximize access to public transportation and often incorporates features to encourage transit FINAL ENVIRONMENTAL ASSESSMENT 54 HALEKAUWILA PLACE APRIL 2010 ridership. A TOD neighborhood will typically have transit station surrounded by relatively high-density development within a 10-minute walk surrounding the station. Features of TOD include mixed-use development that will use transit at all times of the day, excellent pedestrian facilities, collector support from other modes of transportation (buses and shuttles) and reduced amount of parking for personal vehicles. 3.5 RELATIONSHIP TO PLANS, CODES AND ORDINANCES The project site is located within the Kakaako Community Development District (KCDD) Mauka Area administrated by the Hawaii Community Development Authority (HCDA). The KCDD Mauka Area Plan is part of the Hawaii Administrative Rule Title 15, Department of Business, Economic Development & Tourism: Subtitle 4, Hawaii Community Development Authority, Chapter 22, Mauka Area. A Final Environmental Impact Statement for the Mauka Area Plan was accepted in June 1983. Under this master FEIS, impacts relating to the implementation of the Mauka Area Plan and associated rules were assessed in accordance with Chapter 343, Hawaii Revised Statutes. This FEIS document serves as the principal disclosure and impact assessment document for KCDD Mauka Area Plan. The intent of the Draft EA for the Halekauwila Place project is to assess impacts that will result from the proposed rezoning action. Under the KCDD Mauka Area Plan, the project site is identified as Public with surrounding Park and Residential uses. It is the intent of the applicant to rezone the project parcel for Residential Use with the HCDA Board or seek exemptions from zoning requirements and fees from HCDA and the City Council. The proposed zoning change will result in a decrease in Public zoned lands based on the current inventory of State owned lands. While the Public zoning of the parcel was intended to accommodate a school site, site feasibility studies reviewed by the Department of Education indicate that the proposed residential use can also be accommodated within the Public zoned area. Section 201H-38, Hawaii Revised Statutes (HRS) provides a process where affordable housing projects may be granted exemptions from any statutes, ordinances and rules of any government agency relating to planning, zoning and construction standards that do not negatively affect the health and safety of the general public. The Halekauwila Place project will seek the following from State regulations: 1. Increase in floor area ratio 2.86 for maximum planned development to 3.47 FAR. This will increase floor area from an allowed 155,804 square feet to 188,777 square feet. 2. Reduce open space requirements from 5,440 square feet to 3,898 square feet. 3. A waiver from the 11,220 square foot recreation space requirement. This item will be negotiated with HCDA for an acceptable alternative. FINAL ENVIRONMENTAL ASSESSMENT 55 HALEKAUWILA PLACE APRIL 2010 4. A reduction from the requirement for one commercial and two multi-family parking stalls to two multi-purpose loading stalls. The Halekauwila Place project will seek the following from City and County regulations: 1. Exemption from application fees. This would include demolition, building, foundation, plumbing, electrical, fire sprinkler, etc. 2. Exemption from Joint Development application fee. 3. Exemption from Public Works fees and charges including, grading stockpiling, trenching, grubbing and de-watering permit fee. 4. Exemption from private storm drain connection fee. 5. Deferral of wastewater connection and facility charges. 6. Waiver of Temporary and Permanent Certificate of Occupancy fees. 7. Deferral of Board of Water Supply connection and facility charges. 8. Exemption from Park Dedication requirements. 9. General exemption from Chapter 24, Article 2, Primary Urban Center policies as the project is located within the jurisdiction of the Hawaii Community Development Authority's Kakaako District Mauka Area Rules. The State Land Use Commission Boundary Maps identify the project site as being within the Urban area. This is consistent with the surrounding uses that include commercial uses and high-density residential development. From the City and County of Honolulu planning perspective, the project is located within the Primary Urban Center (PUC) of Honolulu. Under Ordinance 04-14, objectives and guidelines have been formulated for the development and growth within the PUC. The Halekauwila Place project conforms with this plan as described as follows: 1. Cultivating Livable Neighborhoods: The project helps solidify a neighborhood center in this changing area. The project will create places where people can gather and shop and meet for community functions. 2. In-Town Housing Choices: The project will create affordable housing to meet the lifestyle needs of different population groups. Halekauwila Place will also support ground level activities in its retail area and meeting facility. The project will also expand the current inventory of affordable rental housing units through the use of incentives and cost savings for affordable housing. The project also strongly supports a new mixed use housing option within close proximity to a planned transit station. The City and County of Honolulu is also presently in the process of developing Transit Oriented Development (TOD) plans for areas surrounding the proposed transit stations for the Honolulu High-Capacity Transit Corridor (HHCTC) project. Presently, a transit station would be located one block away from the Halekauwila Place project. This close proximity significantly increases the potential for high utilization by Halekauwila Place FINAL ENVIRONMENTAL ASSESSMENT 56 HALEKAUWILA PLACE APRIL 2010 residents. As stated in the preceding PUC section, the relationship between in-town housing and rail is mutually supportive and consistent with the objectives of TODs. While actual rail transit utilization cannot be determined, it is anticipated that the Halekauwila Place affordable rental project residents will use public transportation at a higher rate than other market level projects. This decreased reliance on private vehicles does not exempt the project from providing required parking therefore the project will comply with HCDA Mauka Area Plan parking plans. 3.6 PROBABLE IMPACT ON THE ENVIRONMENT The proposed project represents a significant change from its current and former uses. The project is consistent with surrounding land uses and the intent of the prevailing KCDD Mauka Area Plan. Impacts associated with the proposed project have generally been determined to be negligible. Views will be impacted as a result of the new facility but should be considered in the context that any development of the site will result in the loss of open space. Some loss of parking will be experienced with the development of the project. This is to be expected since public parking use was not the long-term intended use for the lot. When viewed in the cumulative with the other components proposed for the project block, impacts to the environment will be more significant. In addition to significantly higher urban density resulting from the build out of all components, traffic and noise impacts will rise over the no-action alternative. These cumulative impacts are largely due to the intensive level of activities that are typically associated with school use. These other uses are however uncertain at this time. Assessment of these cumulative impacts is difficult at best as until uses and specific dates are provided, there are not adequate means of projecting these impacts. As previously stated these impacts are typical and unavoidable from school use. The Department of Education previously stated that a school will be necessary within the project area to accommodate existing and future demand for an elementary school. It is noted that there are no current plans to the development of the school as proposed in the Master Plan and it remains possible that the site could be used for other Department of Education related uses. The Hawaii Housing Finance Development Corporation has also determined that there is a significant need for affordable housing in this highly urban environment. Community park use is also a highly sought use that is considered a necessity within the urban Kakaako area. Finally, the Department of Land and Natural Resources has indicated that the remaining structures from the original Mother Waldron Park are historically significant and must be preserved. All are essential elements that compete for a very important central parcel in central Kakaako. The parcel is also the only publicly owned (State of Hawaii) land available within the project vicinity which compels all competing uses to accommodate each other. FINAL ENVIRONMENTAL ASSESSMENT 57 HALEKAUWILA PLACE APRIL 2010 The proposed master plan represents the best compromise that allows all uses to remain with the least amount of impact to the environment. Cumulatively, implementation of all components will result in greater impact. These impacts, as addressed in the specific sections of this report, are considered acceptable, especially when viewed with respect to the overall benefit provided by their implementation. It remains uncertain however, if the school project will proceed. It remains undeniable that affordable rental housing is required. Positive environmental impacts are expected as a result of the additional affordable residential inventory. An increase in community activity may be expected as a result of the new residents. Based on the information available at the time of this study, the collective implementation of all site components will result in significantly positive overall impacts that offset negative environmental impacts. Implementation of any single component will also yield community improvements however the specific impact of the school is beyond the scope of this study and is likely to be addressed in its own environmental report as planning progresses. 3.7 ADVERSE IMPACTS WHICH CANNOT BE AVOIDED Adverse impacts that cannot be avoided are generally related to short-term construction impacts. These impacts can be minimized by sound construction practices, Best Management Practices (BMPs) adherence to applicable construction regulations as prescribed by the Department of Health, and coordination with applicable County agencies. Primary construction related impacts are discussed in greater detail in the Noise Environment and Air Quality Study appendices. Archaeological artifacts have been uncovered in the project vicinity. Subsurface testing of the project site did not find any significant artifacts. It is recommended by the consulting archaeologist that a monitoring plan be developed due to the proximity of other archaeological finds in the near vicinity of the project site. Increases in traffic and air and noise pollution will occur as is expected of any development of this nature. When viewed in respect to the current parking lot use, these impacts are relatively small and do not have significant impact on the surrounding environment. When viewed cumulatively with the build out of the elementary school and park improvements, these impacts are more significant but will remain within acceptable levels, particularly with the offsetting benefits obtained by these important public uses. It should be noted that while a master plan has been developed for the project block, cumulative impacts resulting from the implementation of all components can only be evaluated effectively with a concrete timetable and a verified program. This report is dependant upon the planning assumptions that were used in the master plan report which did not contain definitive build out schedules. As the first component of the master plan FINAL ENVIRONMENTAL ASSESSMENT 58 HALEKAUWILA PLACE APRIL 2010 to implemented, the subject affordable housing project can only address with any certainty the impacts that result from its direct action. Future components, when further planned and developed, will provide better measures of the cumulative impacts resulting from the full build out of the project block. This will also apply to any future development within the project area outside of the project site. 3.8 ALTERNATIVES TO THE PROPOSED ACTION No other use alternatives beyond the non-action alternative were considered for this project. Non-action was considered and rejected since no benefit to the community would be provided. Within the scope of proposed improvements, alternative density configurations were considered however an optimal high-density scheme was selected to serve as the basis of impact assessment. Alternative locations were not considered because no other suitable State owned lands in the vicinity are available. Privately owned lands in the project area could accommodate the proposed project however acquisition costs would be prohibitive and would be counterproductive to the RFP process which initiated this project. Open space, while also beneficial to the community, does not represent a highest and best use of the project lot. Possible future school use of the project site would provide greater flexibility in the school design but would be gained at the expense of affordable rental housing inventory. 3.9 MITIGATION MEASURES Long-term impacts resulting from the proposed improvements are expected to be minimal or non-existent based upon the subject environmental assessment. Long-term traffic, air and noise impacts are not expected to change significantly after improvements are completed. Short-term construction related noise and air quality impact mitigation measures include general good housekeeping practices and scheduled maintenance to avoid a prolonged construction period. The contractor will be directed to use best management practices (BMP) wherever applicable. 3.10 IRREVERSIBLE AND IRRETRIEVABLE COMMITMENT OF RESOURCES Implementation of the proposed project will result in the irreversible and irretrievable commitment of resources in the use of non-recyclable energy expenditure and labor. Materials used for new construction may have salvage value; however, it is unlikely that such efforts will be cost-effective. The expenditure of these resources is offset by gains in construction-related wages, increased tax base and tertiary spending. FINAL ENVIRONMENTAL ASSESSMENT 59 HALEKAUWILA PLACE APRIL 2010 SECTION FOUR NECESSARY PERMITS AND APPROVALS Permits and approvals that may be required are contingent upon the actual design of the proposed project. The project will seek a change of zone which is a discretionary approval issued by the Hawaii Community Development Authority (HCDA). All other permits and approvals are generally ministerial in nature. Permits listed below represent a general list that represents permits and approvals that will be required by the proposed project. State Agencies Permit or Approval Approving Agency Public to MUZ-R Zoning HCDA Kakaako Community Development District Permit HCDA National Pollutant Discharge Elimination System (NPDES) Permit Dept. of Health HRS 201 H Exemptions from Zoning HHFDC, HCDA County Agencies Permit or Approval Approving Agency Building Permits Dept. of Planning and Permitting Certificate of Occupancy Dept. of Planning and Permitting Dewatering Permit Dept. of Planning and Permitting Grading, Grubbing, Stockpiling, Trenching Dept. of Planning and Permitting Subdivision Approval Dept. of Planning and Permitting Construction Dewatering Permit Dept. of Environmental Services Sewer Connection Permit Dept. of Environmental Services Street Usage Permit Dept. of Transportation Services HRS 201 H Exemptions from Fees City Council FINAL ENVIRONMENTAL ASSESSMENT 60 HALEKAUWILA PLACE APRIL 2010 SECTION FIVE FINDINGS AND REASONS SUPPORTING FINDING OF NO SIGNIFICANT IMPACT As stated in Section 11-200-12, EIS Rules, Significance Criteria: in determining whether an action may have a significant effect on the environment, every phase of a proposed action shall be considered. The expected consequences of an action, both primary and secondary, and the cumulative as well as the short-term and long-term effects must be assessed in determining if an action shall have significant effect on the environment. Each of the significance criteria is listed below and is followed by the means of compliance or conflict (if extant). Involves an irrevocable commitment to the loss or destruction of any natural or cultural resource. The proposed action will occur on an existing developed site and will not impact any topographical resources other than the removal or relocation of some existing trees. Subsurface archaeological artifacts are a possibility; therefore, an archaeological inventory survey has been conducted with no significant findings. In the event that any archaeological remains are uncovered during the course of construction, all work will stop and the State Historic Preservation Office will be contacted for appropriate action. The adjacent Mother Waldron Park is considered a historic site; however, none of the structures will be demolished or impacted by the proposed project. Presently the plantings and minor non-structural work is planned for installation in 2010. Curtails the range of beneficial uses of the environment. The proposed use will result in a significant change from its existing and former uses but represents an appropriate use that will benefit the public and will be environmentally consistent with the surrounding urban area. Beneficial uses of the environment will be expanded by the proposed project by providing needed housing inventory in a convenient urban location in central Honolulu. Recreational uses on the adjacent Mother Waldron Park will not be affected. The existing parking lot located makai of the project site is under consideration by the Department of Education (DOE) for an elementary school. Site studies conducted for the Hawaii Community Development Authority (HCDA) and the DOE indicate that the adequate space remains for future school use. This was acknowledged by the DOE however there are no current plans to build this facility. Conflicts with the State's long-term goals or guidelines as expressed in Chapter 344, HRS, and any revisions thereof and amendments thereto, court decisions, or executive orders. FINAL ENVIRONMENTAL ASSESSMENT 61 HALEKAUWILA PLACE APRIL 2010 The proposed action is consistent with the goals and guidelines expressed in Chapter 344, Hawaii Revised Statutes. The proposed action is triggered by the use of State lands and funds. The subject Environmental Assessment has been developed in compliance with the Chapter 343. Substantially affects the economic or social welfare of the community or state. The proposed action will make a positive contribution to the welfare and economy of the State and City by providing desirable and needed affordable rental housing to the State of Hawaii. The proposed use will eliminate the existing temporary daily parking use for a long-term use. The facility will also contribute positively to the community through the use of goods and services in the area, through construction related employment, and through secondary and tertiary spending and taxes. Substantially affects public health. The proposed improvements are not expected to have any direct impact on public health but will provide affordable housing thereby ensuring a better standard of living for those unable to rent market housing. No recreational resources will be impacted by the project, nor will the project increase any undesirable environmental impacts. Involves substantial or adverse secondary impacts, such as population changes or effects on public facilities. The proposed action will increase the population within the community and will increase the demand for public facilities. These impacts are consistent with residential development of this nature and are not considered adverse impacts. The change in population and demand for public facilities will be readily met by existing infrastructure and services. Involves a substantial degradation of environmental quality. The proposed action will not degrade environmental quality. Impacts associated with the project, such as traffic impact and air and noise quality have been assessed to be minimal. The project is located in a highly urban environment that is expected to be heavily developed in the future. In that respect, the project is consistent with the overall land use of the district. Is individually limited but cumulatively has a considerable effect upon the environment or involves a commitment for larger actions. The proposed action is not a first phase of, or related to, any larger action. The cumulative effect of the project is disclosed in this document (and associated figures and charts) and does not involve any planned future actions that will cumulatively impact the environment. Other actions in the vicinity include a possible elementary school, and park improvements planned for 2010; however, these actions are not part of the subject action FINAL ENVIRONMENTAL ASSESSMENT 62 HALEKAUWILA PLACE APRIL 2010 and no timeframes or commitments have been provided to these possible future improvements. Substantially affects rare, threatened or endangered species, or their habitats. The proposed action will not affect any rare, threatened or endangered species of flora or fauna, nor is it known to be near or adjacent to any known wildlife sanctuaries. Detrimentally affect air or water quality or ambient noise levels. The proposed action will not impact air or water quality. Noise levels will change from those of an open-air parking lot to a residential structure. Minimal impacts on air quality and noise are anticipated during construction, but will be limited by normal construction practices and Department of Health construction mitigation standards. Affects or is likely to suffer damage by being located in an environmentally sensitive area such as a flood plain, tsunami zone, beach erosion prone area, geologically hazardous land, estuary, fresh water, or coastal waters. The project will not have any impact on an environmentally sensitive area. Substantially affects scenic vistas and viewplanes identified in County or State plans or studies. The proposed action will not affect any scenic vistas or significant viewplanes as identified in HCDA or City and County plans. The project is located in a highly urban environment and is not located on a Kakaako Community Development District Mauka Area Plan view corridor street. Require substantial energy consumption. The project will increase electrical energy consumption over the existing use. This increase will be consistent with residential use and will be typical of any high-density urban use. Based on the above stated criteria, the proposed Halekauwila Place affordable rental project will not have a significant effect on the environment. As such, a Finding of No Significant Impact (FONSI) is warranted for the project.

Management Summary Reference Archaeological Assessment of th e Proposed Halekauwila Place Project, 2009 Project (s) Cultural Surveys Hawai'i Inc. (CSH) Job Code: KAKAAKO 13 Investigation Permit Number The fieldwork component of the archaeological assessment investigation was carried out unde r archaeological permit number 09- 20, issued by the Hawai'i St ate Historic Preservation Division/Department of Land and Natural Resources (SHPD/DLNR), per Hawai'i Administrative Rules (HAR) Chapter 13-282. Project Location The project area is located in the mauka (inland) area of Kaka'ako, consisting of the northeastern portion of the block bounded by Halekauwila Street, Keawe Street, Pohukaina Street, and the Mother Waldron Park. The project area is depicted on the U.S. Geological Survey 7.5-Minute Series Topogr aphic Map, Honolulu Quadrangle (1998). Land Jurisdiction Government; State of Hawai'i Agencies Hawai'i Community Development Au thority (HCDA); State Historic Preservation Division / Department of Land and Natural Resources (SHPD/DLNR) Project Description The proposed Halekauwila Place Project consists of development of a mixed-income urban housing comm unity, including: a 19-story residential tower with ground-level retail and meeting spaces; condominium townhomes; and a multi -level parking garage with ground-level retail spaces. Minimally , activities would include: and associ ated infrastructure improvements. Project Acreage 1.25 acres Area of Potential Effect (APE) and Survey Acreage The proposed project's area of potential effect (APE) is defined as the entire 1.25-acre project area.

Cultural Surveys Hawa i'i Job Code: KAKAAKO 13 Management Summary Archaeological Assessment, Place Project, Kaka'ako, Honolulu, O'ahu ii TMK [1] 2-1-051:009 por. Historic Preservation Regulatory Context This document was prepared to supp ort the planned project's historic preservation review under Hawai' i Revised Statutes (HRS) Chapter 6E-8 and Hawai'i Administrative Rules (HAR) Chapter 13-13-275. In consultation with the State Historic Preservation Division (SHPD), an archaeological inventory survey plan was prepared prior to conducting the current archaeological assessment study. The Archaeological Inventory Survey Plan for the Proposed Halekauwila Place Project, Kaka'ako, Kona District, O'ahu Island (Hammatt and Shideler 2008) was reviewed and accepted by SHPD in 2008 (LOG NO: 2008.2059, DOC NO: 0808LM05; see Appedix A). In consultation with the SHPD, the archaeological inventory survey investigation was designed to fulfill the State requirements for an archaeological inventory survey, per HAR Chapter 13-13-276. Because no historic properties were identified in the project area, th is investigation is termed an archaeological assessment, per HAR Chapter 13-13-284-5. Fieldwork Effort Fieldwork was conducted from June 4-9, 2009 and required 14 person- days to complete. The CSH field crew consisted of: Douglas Borthwick, Darienne Dey, B.A.; under the general supervision of principa l investigator Hallett H. Hammatt, Ph.D. Number of Historic Properties Identified None Effect Recommendation No historic properties were identif ied during the curre nt archaeological assessment study. However, based on background research, including the previous identification of huma n skeletal remains in the immediate vicinity of the project area, there is potential for encountering human skeletal remains within the na tural sandy clay-type sediments underlying fill material in the project area. Due to the potential adverse effect on significant historic properties within the project's APE, specifically inadvertent burial disc overies, CSH's project-specific effect recommendation is \"effect, with proposed mitigation commitments.\" Mitigation Recommendation Archaeolgical monitoring is r ecommended during all land disturbing activities within the project ar ea. Archaeological monitoring will ensure proper treatment and documentation should any historic properties be discovered during project -related construction activities. An archaeological monitoring plan should be prepared for review and approval of the State Historic Pres ervation Divison (SHPD) prior to project construction. In accordance with HAR 13-279, the monitoring plan should detail specific arch aeological monitoring provisions.

Section 1 Introduction 1.1 Project Background At the request of Halekauwila Partners, LLC, Cultural Surveys Hawai'i, Inc. (CSH) completed an archaeological asse ssment of the proposed Haleka uwila Place O'ahu Island (T MK: [1] 2-1-051:009 por.). The proj ect area is located in the mauka (inland) area of Kaka'ako, consisting of th e northeastern portion of the block bounded by Halekauwila Street, Keawe Street, Pohukaina Street , and the Mother Waldron Park (Figures 1-3). The project area is depicted on the U.S. Geological Survey 7.5- Minute Series Topographic Map, Honolulu Quadrangle (1998). The project area is gove rnment-owned by the State of Hawai' i, under the jurisdiction of the Hawai'i Community Development Authority (H CDA). The proposed Hale kauwila Place Project consists of development of a mixed-income urban housing community, including: a 19-story residential tower with ground-level retail and meeting spaces; condominium townhomes; and a multi-level parking garage with ground-level reta il spaces (Figure 4 and Figure 5). Minimally, land disturbing activitie s would include: grubbing and grad excavations for building foundations and subsurface utilities; and associat ed infrastructure improvements. The proposed project's area of potentia l effect (APE) is define d as the entire 1.25-acre pr oject area. The survey area for the current archaeo logical assessment included the entire 1.25-acre APE. This document was prepared to support the pla nned project's historic preservation review under Hawai'i Revised Statutes (HRS) Chapter 6E -8 and Hawai'i Administrative Rules (HAR) Chapter 13-13-275. In consultation with the Stat e Historic Preservatio n Division (SHPD), an archaeological inventory survey plan was prepar ed prior to conducting th e current archaeological assessment study. The Archaeological Inventory Survey Plan for the Proposed Halekauwila Place Project, Kaka'ako, Kona District, O'ahu Island (Hammatt and Shideler 2008) was reviewed and accepted by SHPD in 2008 (LOG NO: 2008.2059, DOC NO: 0808LM05; see Appedix A). In consultation with the SHPD, the archaeological inventory survey investigation was designed to fulfill the State requirements for an archaeological inventory survey, per HAR Chapter 13-13-276. Because no historic properties were identified in the project area, this investigation is term ed an archaeological assessme nt, per HAR Chapter 13-13-284-5. 1.2 Scope of Work The following scope of work satisfies State and County requirements for an archaeological inventory survey [per HAR 13-13-276] . The scope of work included: 1. Appropriate consultation with knowledgeab le members of the community, requesting information on historic properties in the project area.

A complete ground survey of the entire project area for the purpose of historic property identification and doc umentation. All historic prop erties would be located, described, and mapped with evaluation of function, inte rrelationships, and significance. Documentation would includ e photographs and sc ale drawings of selected historic properties. All hi storic properties would be assigned Inventory of Historic Properties numbers by the State. All historic properties would be located with Trimble GPS equipment and presented in the report in ArcGIS format. 3. Eighteen trenches utilizing a combination of mechanical and manual excavation were excavated across the parcel in order to id entify any buried cultur al deposits and /or human burials. If appropriate samples from these excavations were found, they would be analyzed for chronological a nd paleoenvironmental information. 4. Research on historic and archaeological background, including search of historic maps, written records, and Land Commi ssion Award documents. This research focused on the specific project area, with general background on the ahupua'a and district, and emphasizes settlement patterns. 5. Preparation of this archaeological as sessment report, including the following: a. A topographic map of the survey area showing all historic properties; b. Results of consultation with knowledgeable community members about the property's past land use a nd historic properties; c. Description of all historic properties with selected photographs, scale drawings, and discussions of function; d. Historical and archaeological background sections summarizing prehistoric and historic land use as they relate to the project area's hi storic properties; e. Recommendations based on all information generated that will specify what steps should be taken to mitigate the impact of development on the project area's significant historic properties - such as data recovery (excavation) and preservation of specific areas. Thes e recommendations were developed in consultation with the client and the State agencies. This scope of work also included full coordi nation with the State Historic Preservation Division (SHPD) and City and County of Honol ulu relating to archaeo logical matters. This coordination takes place after consent of the owner or representatives. 1.3 Environmental Setting 1.3.1 Natural Environment The project area is located on the nearly-level coastal plain of Kaka'a ko, in southern O'ahu. The elevation of the project area is approxi mately 1.5 m (5.0 ft.) above mean sea level. Sediments within the project area are primarily designated Mixed Fill Land (FL), with Ewa Silty Clay Loam (EmA) in the northwestern portion of th e project area (Foote et al. 1972) (Figure 6). Mixed Fill Land is described as land used for urban development and the fill as \"materials dredged from the ocean or hauled from nearby ar eas, garbage, and general material from other Cultural Surveys Ha wai'i Job Code: KAKAAKO 13 Intr oduction O'ahu 8 TMK [1] 2-1-051:009 por.

The filling and subse quent development of the low-lying marshes, tidal flats, fish ponds, and reef areas, which c onstituted the undeveloped natural condition of the Kaka'ako area, permanently change d it into its present fully urba nized character. Sediments of the Ewa Series are described as \"well-drained so ils in basins and on allu vial fans...developed in alluvium derived from basic Ewa Silty Clay Loam t ypically overlying coral limestone at depths of 0.5- 1.5 m (Foote et al. 1972). The project area receives approximately 600 mm (24 in.) of annual rainfall (Giambelluca et al. 1986). As the project area is almost entirely asphalt-paved, vege tation within the project area is limited to a few monkey-pod trees ( Pithecellobium saman ) and one large ficus tree ( Ficus sp. ). 1.3.2 Built Environment The project area is almost entirely asphalt-paved and is currently used as a parking lot. A large warehouse is located s outhwest of the project area, on the same block. The Mother Waldron Park, with landscaped areas, athletic f acilities, and restroom facilities is located southeast of the project area. The surrounding Kaka'ako area is ur ban, with a mix of industrial warehouses, low-rise commercial buildings , and high-rise resi dential buildings. Cultural Hawai'i Job KAKAAKO Methods Archaeological Assessment, Kaka'ako, Honolulu, O'ahu 10 TMK [1] 2-1-051:009 por. Section 2 Methods 2.1 Field Methods The fieldwork component of the archaeological assessment investigation was carried out under archaeological permit number 09-20, issued by the Hawai'i State Hi storic Preservation Division/Department of Land and Natura l Resources (SHPD/DLNR), per Hawai'i Administrative Rules (HAR) Chapter 13-282. Fi eldwork was conducted from June 4-9, 2009 and required 14 person-days to complete. The CSH field crew consisted of: Douglas and Darienne Dey, B.A.; under the general supervision of principal investigator Halle tt H. Hammatt, Ph.D. Fieldwork consisted of a complete pedestrian inspection of the project area, as well as a program of subsurface testing. The subsurface tes ting program consisted of the excavation of 18 test trenches, with each trench measuring a pproximately 6 m long and 0.8 m wide, for a total excavation of approximately 86 m 2. This represented a sample size of approximately 2 % of the project area. Test trench es were distributed throughout the proj ect area to provide representative coverage and assess the stratigraphy and potential fo r subsurface cultural resources in the project area. The testing program also focused on charact erizing the remnants of the project area's buried land surface that predated th e historic and modern fill layers. These remnants of the older land surface were more likely to be associated with significant cultural deposits. All trenches were excavated down to the underlying co ral shelf or below the water table. A standard backhoe with a two- foot wide bucket was used to excavate at least portions of each test trench. The backhoe was initially us ed to remove asphalt paving and overlying fill deposits within each test trench. When excavati on occurred through native soil deposits, which are more likely to contain human skeletal remains or other significant cultural deposits, the entire trench including the base of the trench and the side walls was cleaned with hand tools to reveal any potential cultural features su ch as pits, postholes or any othe r cultural disturbances to the natural sediment. If cultural features were identif ied, they were explored and carefully excavated with hand tools to reveal their nature and co ntent. Following cleaning of the trench, if no potential cultural features were identified, limited hand-excava tion testing was then undertaken. Hand excavation consisted of a continuous linear tr ench down the entire l ong axis of the backhoe trench. Following hand-excavation, if no eviden ce of cultural features was present and the natural sediment was determined to be steril e, the backhoe was utilized to complete the excavation. Each test trench was documented with a sc ale section profile, phot ographs, and sediment descriptions. Sediment descriptions, using standard USDA soil description observations/terminology, included: of any inclusions, su ch as cultural material and/or roots and rootlets; lower bou ndary distinctiveness an d topography; and other general observations. Cultural fe atures were represented on the trench profile. Feature documentation included profiles and/or plan views, collected samples, stratigraphic descriptions, and photographs. The location of each test trench was recorded using a Trimble ProXH GPS unit (sub-foot horizontal accuracy).

Following the completion of fieldwork, all collected materi als were analyzed using current standard archaeological laboratory techniques. Historic materials collected in the field were returned to the CSH laboratory and washed, examined, and, as appropriate, photographe d. Historic artifacts were identified using standard reference material s and the resources availa ble over the internet. 2.3 Document Review Historic and archival research included in formation obtained from the UH Hamilton Library, the State Historic Preservation Division Library, the Hawai'i St ate Archives, the State Land Survey Division, and the Archives of the Bishop Museum. Previous archaeological reports for the area were reviewed, as were historic maps and primary and secondary historical sources. Information on Land Commission Awards was accessed through Waihona ' ina Corporation's Mhele Data Base ( www.waihona.com ). 2.4 Consultation In 2001, CSH conducted a cultural impact asse ssment for the Mother Waldron Playground and the Former Pohukaina School Site, an area that includes the current project area (McGuire and Hammatt 2001). The following are the resu lts of the cultural impact assessment. The results of the community consultations are summarized in Table 1. In consultation with the SHPD Culture/History Branch, it was determined that the consultation process need not be as broad as originally intended, due to several factor s: 1) the Kaka'ako area previously consisted of fish ponds and tidal flats and was s ubject to intertidal influences; 2) the soil in the project area is predominantly Fill (FL) (Foote et al. 1972). (The historic record confirms that in the early 20th century, the Kaka`ako area was filled in due to expansion activities.); 3) the project area is in a developed and previously distur bed area; and 4) due to devel opment of the commercial and industrial district, the original homes were torn down in the last 10-15 years and the once tight- knit community dispersed and relocated elsewh ere. Based on SHPD's recommendations, the individuals and organizati ons listed in Table 1 were consulted with and deemed to be sufficient. None of the individuals or or ganizations contacted had any know ledge of Hawaiian traditional cultural practices occurring in the project area. Ad ditionally no cultural concerns were expressed. Two referrals (Akea family and Henry Huihui ) were not contacted due to no contact phone number or forwarding address. Two people who knew Mother Waldron were contacted: Aaron Chaney and Harold W. Horne, grandson of Mo ther Waldron. Though they gave details on the life of Mother Waldron, they had no knowledge of specific cultural practices which might have occurred in the project area.

Section 3 Background Research 3.1 Traditional and Hist orical Background 3.1.1 Overview of Kaka'ako The modern urban district known as Kaka'ako is significantly larger than the traditional area of the same name, which is described in mid-19th century documents and maps as a small 'ili (traditional land unit within an ahupua'a ) within the ahupua'a (traditional land division) of Honolulu. In addition to the 'ili of Kaka'ako, the modern Kaka'a ko area also includes lands once known as Ka' kaukukui, Kukulu e'o, and Honuaka ha, Pu'unui, Ka'ala'a, ' pua, and 'Auwaiolimu, as shown on late 19th century maps (Figure 7, Figure 8, and Figure 9). The current project area is located within the Pu'unui area of Ka' kaukukui 'Ili. The original location and extent of an area called Kaka'ako is ambiguous. The ethnographer Henry Kekahuna (1958:4), who was born in Hawai' i in 1891 and was a long-time resident of O'ahu, placed it \"on the Ewa side of Kuloloia Stream where the Honolulu Iron Works and Fort Armstrong are now,\" an area now covered by One Waterfront Plaza (between South and Punchbowl Streets). Kekahuna (1958:4) also related that \"there were formerly scattered dunes of white sand there. Gilbert Islanders (Kilipaki) squatted there, and made a living by fishing, collecting coral for curios, and catching octopus.\" Only four LC A claims list their location as within the ' ili of Kaka'ako. These are also generally located adjacent to the sea, east of Punchbowl Street between Pohukaina Street an d Reed Lane. The 1884 map of the \"Kewalo\" section of Honolulu by S.E. Bishop (Figure 7) does not show an area named Kaka'ako at all. On an 1897 map of Honolulu by M.D. Monsarrat, the ar ea adjacent to the coastal wharfs is labeled Kaka'ako (Figure 8). These maps and documents all place the 'ili of Kaka'ako at the western end of the modern Kaka'ako district . The only late nineteenth centu ry map that has a mark for Kaka'ako east of this general area is an 1876 C.J. Lyons map of Ka' kaukukui and Pu'unui, which has a coastal point (marked by a triangle) labeled Kaka'ako (Figure 9). However, this is likely a triangulation station us ed by surveyors for mapping, rath er than a point marking the central section of Kaka'ako. Until the end of the 19 th century, Kaka'ako was considered to be something of a wasteland, or empty space, between the better-known locatio ns of Kou (modern-day Honolulu) and Waik k. Recent archaeological projects, as sociated with development and construction in the area, have documented several large cemeteries dating from the earlier historic period and perhaps late pre- Contact times. Otherwise, the place is known, and fam ous in a traditional se nse, for its low-lying marshes, fishponds and salt making. It does not appear that the current project area was in an area of dense or permanent settlement in traditional times. Most of the pre-contact and early post-contact population was clustered in the village of Honuakaha, northwest of the current project area, or scattered adjacent to the main trails (i.e. Queen and King Streets), north of the current project area. However, in later post-contact times (post-1850), this changed, as population pressure in Honolulu and urban expansion led to the infilling of marshes and wetlands on the outskirts of Honolulu, and the subsequent development of the Kaka'ako area.

The resear chers for this book based their interpretations not only on l iteral (phonetic) translations of the words, but also on oral traditions and historic documents. In this wor k, the place names of geographic features and ahupua'a names are translated; however, 'ili names are not usually presented. Thomas Thrum also published a short paper on place names in the 1922 edition of Lorrin Andrews A Dictionary of the Hawaiian Language , based only on the phonetic translations of the place names. This work does have a large number of translated 'ili names. However, because there are no oral or written docum ents to confirm Thrum's interpretations, Mary Pukui (Pukui et al. 1974:136) cautioned that Thru m's translations were sometimes \"unreliable.\" Thrums's translations are presented here si nce it is our only source for many 'ili names, but Pukui's cautionary note for these interpretations should be kept in mind. Many of the place names listed below are associated with specific mo'olelo (oral histories) and wahi pana (legendary or storied places). The locations of some of these place names can be seen on Figure 7, Figure 8, and Figure 9. Pukui et al. (1974) do not give a meaning for the place name Kaka'ako , but the Hawaiian word kk'ko can slow\" (Pukui chop, beat, or thresh; ako=thatch). If Thrum's translation is correct, it co uld be related to the fact that salt marshes, such as areas like Kaka'ako, were excellent places to gather tall pili grass, which the Hawaiians traditionally used to thatch their houses. According to Kekahuna (1958:4), Ka'kaukukui was \"a beautiful sand beach that formerly extended along Ala Moana Park to Kewalo Basi n, a quarter mile long reef extended along the shore.\" An 1884 map (see Figure 7) shows it ex tending from Punchbowl to Cooke Street, makai of Queen Street. Pukui et al. (1974) describe Ka' kaukukui as a \"filled-in reef,\" and literally translate the name as \"the right (or north) light ,\" possibly referring to a maritime navigation landmark. Thrum (1922:635) translates it as \"radia ting place for lamp.\" In the early twentieth century, it was translated as \"to the right of the lighthouse\" by the squatters who lived in the area (Gessler 1938:187). This would have been an accura te description of the area at that time as Ka'kaukukui was east, or \"to the ri ght\" of the Honolulu Lighthouse in the harbor. However, this is probably a historic, not an ancient, interpretati on as the Honolulu Lighthouse, was not built until 1869 (Dean 1991:7). The area around One Waterfront Plaza, west of the current project area, was the location of a pond called Umukanaka, or Kaimukanaka, as seen on th e 1876 Lyons map (see Figure 9). Griffin et al. (1987:39) suggested that this pond may have been the same as a place called Ka- imu-hai-kanaka , which means \"the oven of human s acrifice.\" However, Henry Kekahuna, a noted ethnologist born in the islands in 1881 (1958:6, 20), stat es that Kaimuhaikanaka was actually the original name for the Honolulu Fo rt, built by Kamehameha I in 1816, which was located at the corner of Queen and Fort Streets, north of the current project area. Honolulu Fort was adjacent to the main temple of Honolulu, P kk Heiau, which was used for human sacrifice. Cultural Surveys Hawai' i Job Code: KAKAAKO 13 Background Research Archaeological Assessment, Place Project, Kaka'ako, Honolulu, O'ahu 19 TMK [1] 2-1-051:009 por. Several of these place names are mentioned in the chant \"The Battle of Nu'uanu,\" which concerns the 1795 invasion and conquer of O'ahu by Kamehameha I. One section of the chant describes locations in Honolulu, listing them from east to west: 75 Lauwili i Kukulu e'o. Mmala (\"to protect\") is the name of a canoe landing in Honolulu Bay. Kuloloia (meaning unknown) is a stream, the harbor, and beach at the end of Fort Street. Pkk is the name of a canoe landing and an important heiau, also located at the foot of Fort Street (Griffin et al. 1987:39). There are several interpretations for the name P kk. In Place Names of Hawai'i (Pukui et al. 1974:175), the name is translated as \"to skim, as stones over water.\" In the Hawaiian Dictionary by Pukui and Elbert (1986:304), pkk is translated as \"low and br oad.\" Lebo has suggested that the correct translation may be \"c ourtyard for smiting,\" as this heiau was used for human sacrifice. Westervelt (1963:21), in his collection on Honolulu legends, noted that the heiau : ...was standing on the western side of the foot of Fort Stre et long after the [Honolulu] fort was built from which the street was named. It was just below the fort...In this temple, the school of the priests of Oahu had its headquarters for centuries. The walls of the temple were adorned with heads of men offered in sacrifice. The root word hai, \"sacrifice\" is found in the place name Ka-imu-hai-kanaka (\"the oven of human sacrifice\"), a place probably a ssociated with, and located near P kk, a sacrificial heiau . It is not found in the place name for the pond Ka-imu-kanaka in Ka' kaukukui, so there is no indication that this was also a place for sacrif ice. However in the Battle of Nu'uanu chant presented above, the place name Ka-imu-hai-Kanaka is used twice. If the chant is listing places from east to west, then the place names are Pu 'ukea, Ka-imu-hai-kanaka, Kaka'ako, Kuloloia, Pkk, of Kukulu e'o, southeast of the project area. Kuloloia and P kk are northwest of the project ar ea near downtown Honolulu. It is possible that there was also a place called Ka-imu-h ai-kanaka near the project area, in the land of Ka'kaukukui. Ka'kaukukui was a lele, or jump land. That is, it had several non-contiguous parcels, one at the coast and two others were inland. It was adjacent on the mauka side to several other small 'ili and lele are a few other names on the 1876 map (see Figure 9) near the curre nt project area. The westernmost salt pan area is labeled Kaimukanaka , the name of a pond and also an 'ili. One claim was made for the ' ili of Kaimukanaka (LCA 8057 to E hu), but it was not awarded. Two Cultural Surveys Hawai' i Job Code: KAKAAKO 13 Background Research Archaeological Assessment, Place Project, Kaka'ako, Honolulu, O'ahu 20 TMK [1] 2-1-051:009 por. other names in the salt pan area are Kalokoeli, \"the dug pond\" may mean \"pit.\") These may be 'ili or pond names, or both. Kukulue'o, translated literally is th e \"Hawaiian stilt (bird),\" Himantopus , and means \"to walk on stilts.\" P ukui et al. (1974) described the area as \"formerly fronting Ke-walo Basin\" and \"containing marshes, salt ponds, and small fishponds,\" an environment well suited for this t ype of bird (Griffin et al. 1987:36). Kekahuna (1958:4) described it as \"the la nd on the upland side of Ka' kaukukui. Salt was formerly made there.\" Kewalo literally means \"the calling (as an ec ho).\" Land Commissi on Award and other historic-era documents identif y it as the area between C ooke and Sheridan Streets, mauka of Queen Street and the coastal sections of Ka' kaukukui, Kukulu e'o, and K al. (1974:109), \"outcasts ( kauw) intended for sacrifice were drowned here\" (see mo'olelo below). Kekahuna said that at one time, it al so had a sand beach as a part of the area, where various sports, such as surfing, were held. 3.1.3 Mo'olelo Associated with Place Names Thecurrent project area is loca ted in a region known as Ka' kaukukui. It is makai of Kewalo on early historic maps and west of the land called Kukulu e'o. The names Ka' kaukukui and Kukulue'o do not appear in any citations in Hawaiian Island Legends Index or in the index to Fornander's Collection of Hawa iian Antiquities and Folklore . There are a few mentions of the place names \"Kewalo\" and Kaka'ako in various legends and traditions. Kaka'ako and Kukulue'o are mentioned in some post-contact chants. From these legendary accounts it can be seen that Ka' kaukukui, Kukulu e'o, and Kewalo hponds and salt pans; the marsh lands where pili grass and other plants could be collected; ceremonial sites such as Pu'ukea Heiau, Kewalo Spring, and Kawailumalumai Pond, at which sacrifices were ma de; and their trails that allowed transport between the more populated areas of Waik k and Honolulu. Important chiefs were born in the area and conducted religious rites, and commoners traveled to the area to procure food and other resources. Some commoners probably also lived in the area, possibly adjacent to the ponds and the trails. 3.1.3.1 Kaka'ako Kaka'ako is mentioned in Thrum's version of the legend of K 'ula, the god presiding over the fish, and his son 'Ai'ai, who was the first to te ach the Hawaiians how to make various fishing lines and nets, the first to set up a ko'a k'ula, a rock shrine on which the fishermen would place their first catch as an offering to K 'ula, and the first to set up ko'a ia , fishing stations where certain fish were known to gath er. Leaving his birthplace in Ma ui, 'Ai'ai traveled around the islands, establishing ko'a k'ula and ko'a ia . On O'ahu, he landed first at Makapu'u in Ko'olaupoko, then traveled clockwise around the island. Aiai came to Kalia [Waik k] and so on to Kakaako. Here he was befriended by a man named Apua, with whom he remained several days, observing and listening to the murmurs of the chief named K ou. This chief was a skillful haiku [Katsuwonus pelamis ; bonito] fisherman, his grounds being outside of Mamala Cultural Surveys Hawai' i Job Code: KAKAAKO 13 Background Research Archaeological Assessment, Place Project, Kaka'ako, Honolulu, O'ahu 21 TMK [1] 2-1-051:009 por. until you came to Moanalua. There was none so skilled as he, and generous withal, giving akus to the people throughout the district. [Thrum 1998:242] 3.1.3.2 Kewalo Kewalo once had a freshwater spring in the central portion, as s een in the proverb \" Ka wai huahua'i o Kewalo ,\" which translates as \"The bubbling water of Kewalo.\" Two springs are mentioned in a traditional story of the Waters of Ha'o. This legend tells of two children of the chief Ha'o who ran away from their cruel stepmo ther. They stayed a time with the caretakers of Kewalo Spring, which may have been located close to the trail that connected Waik k and Honolulu. The children then left when they heard that the chiefess had sent men to look for them. The two children followed the moonlit trail across the plain toward Kou (Honolulu), but finally collapsed from weariness and thirst. In a drea m, the boy's mother told him to pull up a plant close to his feet. When he did, he found a spring under the plant, which was called the Water of Ha'o, or Kawaiaha'o. This spring is located at the western end of the trail, near Kawaiaha'o Church in Kaka'ako (Pukui 1988:87-89). Kewalo also once had a famous fishpond that wa s used to drown members of a pariah caste (kauw) or kapu (taboo) breakers as the first step in a sacrificia l ritual known as Knwai Kaihehe'e (Kamakau , which translates as \"sea sliding along,\" suggesting the victims were slid under the sea (Weste rvelt 1963:16). Kewalo is described as: A fishpond and surrounding land on the pl ains below King Street, and beyond. It contains a spring rather famous in the times previous to the conversion to Christianity, as the place where victims designed for the Heiau of Kanelaau on Punchbowl slopes, was first drowned. The priest holding the victim's head under water would say to her or him on any signs of struggling, \"Moe malie i ke kai o ko haku.\" \"Lie still in the waters of your superiors.\" From this it was called Kawailumalumai, \"Drowning waters.\" [Sterling and Summers 1978: 292] Kewalo is mentioned in a legend as a marsh near the beach, where tall pili grass was growing. A man named Kapoi went to this area to get th atching for his house. While there, Kapoi found seven owls eggs and took them home to cook for his supper. An owl perched on the fence surrounding his house and cried out \"O Kapoi, give me my eggs!\" After several such pleas, Kapoi eventually returned the eggs. In return, the owl became his 'aumakua (family god) and instructed him to build a heiau (pre-Christian place of worship) named M noa. Kapoi built the heiau, placed some bananas on the alta r as a sacrifice, and set the kapu days for its dedication. The king of O'ahu, K kuhihewa, who was building his own heiau in Waikk, had made a law that if any man among his people erected a heiau and set the kapu before him, that man should die. Kapoi was seized and taken to the heiau of Kpalaha, at Waik k. Kapoi's ' aumakua owl asked for aid from the king of the owls at Owl's Hill (Pu'u Pu'eo) in M noa, who gathered all of the owls of the islands. They flew to K palaha and battled the king's men, who finally surrendered. From this time, the owl was considered a powerful akua (god). The battle area was known as Kukaeunahio-ka-pueo, which means \"the confused noise of Thrum 1998: the great chief Hua-nui-ka-la-la'ila'i, as mentioned in this mele (story) chanted by Kamakau (1991 24): Cultural Surveys Hawai' i Job Code: KAKAAKO 13 Background Research Archaeological Assessment, Place the O Honolulu o Waik k O Honolulu, of Waik k I hanau no la i kahua la i , Was born at Kewalo, 'O la lia was the place [the site] O Makiki la ke we, At Makiki the I Knel'au i Kahehuna ke piko, 'a'a; Kalo Pauoa The chief Hua was famous for his love of cultivation and his care for the people.

The word was also us ed to describe a rite to exorcise an evil spirit, as the skilled kahuna (priest) \"peeled\" the malicious spirit from the afflicted. Used in the ritual was a shrimp called mahiki or a native grass called mahiki . Mahiki Sporobolos sp.) found near the seashore. The ethnol ogist, Mary Pukui, states that even during her youth, parents put \" t leaves, or hala, or 'aki'aki grass, in a little sea-salt water and [would] have the child drink it\" (Pukui et al. 1 972:163) to rid them of badly-behaving spirits. The use of this grass in a ritual may explain its association with a ceremonial heiau , or it may simply be that the Kukulu e'o coast was a good habitat and thus a favored place for healers to collect this type of grass. 3.1.3.3 Ka'kaukukui Ka'kaukukui is briefly mentioned in the legend of Hi'iaka, beloved si ster of the Hawaiian volcano goddess, Pele. Hi'iaka and her companions had been traveling around O'ahu on the land trails, but decided to trav el from Pu'uloa (on Pearl Harbor in 'Ewa) to Waik k by canoe. At Pu'uloa, Hi'iaka met a party who were planning on traveling to the house of the chiefess Pele'ula in Waikk. Hi'iaka recited a chant, telling the peopl e although they were going by land and she was going by sea they would meet again in Kou (anc ient name of Honolulu). One portion of the Cultural Surveys Hawai' i Job Code: KAKAAKO 13 Background Research Archaeological Assessment, Place Honolulu, O'ahu 23 chant mentions the place Ka' kaukukui, with reference to a pool, possibly a reference to the salt ponds of the area: A pehea l au, e Honoka'upu, ku'u aloha And what of me, O Honoka'upu, my love I ka welelau nalu kai o Uhi, o ' a Upon the crest of the surf at Uhi and 'O 'O n makai ke ao (p ) o poina Eyes in the living realm (night) of oblivion Ma hea l wau, e ke aloha l Where am I, O my love 'O Kou ka papa Kou is the coral flat 'O Ka'kaukukui ka loko Ka'kaukukui is the pool a'e n Some ' alamihi indeed 'O ka l a p iho Wait all day until night Hui aku i Kou n maka . Friends shall meet in Kou. [Ho'oulum hiehie 2006a:297; hiehie 2006b:277] The exact meaning of the word alamihi within this ch ant is unknown. ' Alamihi is the name of a native Hawaiian small black crab ( Metopograpsus thukuhar ), a scavenger that is often associated in Hawaiian sayings with corpse -eating (Pukui and Elbert 1986:18). Alamihi is also used as name that can mean \"path [o f] regret\" (Pukui et al. 1974:9). 3.1.4 Heiau of Honolulu There is no mention in historical documents for any heiau on the coastal Ka' kaukukui or Pu'unui lands. However, th ere were at least three heiau in the general coastal Honolulu area. In the chant to the chief Hua, the heiau of Pu'ukea in Kukulu e'o is mentioned. The literal meaning of Pu'ukea is \"white hill\" (although it ma y have alternate meanings). Pu'ukea is also the name of a small land division within the ' ili of Kukulu e'o, mentioned in at least two Land Commission Awards, LCA 1502 (not awarded) and LCA 1504. LCA 1504 was located near the junction of Halekauwila St reet and Cooke Street. It is fairly common for a heiau to have the same name as the ' ili in which it is located, so it is possibl e that Pu'ukea Heiau was also near the junction of Halekauwila and Cooke streets. The majority of the housesites in the mid-nineteenth century in Kukulu e'o were located near Halekauwila Street and Queen Street, mauka of the low-lying coastal swamplands on higher , dry ground. It is possible that the heiau platform or the area that it was built on was one of the few \"high spots\" in the flat, low-lying swamp that surrounded it, and thus gained the name pu'u kea (white hill). The second heiau known for the Honolulu area is P kk Heiau, once located at the foot of Fort Street. Kamehameha I lived in a complex around P kk Heiau from 1809 to 1812. The site's use as a ceremonial structure e nded in 1819 with the abolition of the kapu (tabu) system. The area of the heiau platform was part of a royal vill age up to 1826, when Ka'ahumanu, wife of Kamehameha, moved from this complex to a site nearer Kawaiaha'o C hurch to be near the houses of the new American missionaries (Kam akau 1961:265). In 1816, the Honolulu Fort had been built to the east of the complex. The fort was demolished in 1857 to make way for expansion of the harbor complex (Judd 1975:59). Thomas Thrum, who made several lists and surveys for Hawaiian heiau , does list P kk but does not mention Pu'ukea Heiau. He adds a thir d Honolulu temple, (Thrum Cultural Surveys Hawai' i Job Code: KAKAAKO 13 Background Research Archaeological Assessment, Place Honolulu, O'ahu 24 TMK [1] 2-1-051:009 por. 1906a:44), destroyed by the time of his survey, but once located in downtown Honolulu in the general area of 'Iolani Palace. In a report on the survey of O'ahu sites conducted in the early 1930s, McAllister (1933:80) says of Honolulu \"Inf ormation regarding former sites within the present limits of Honolulu must come entire ly from literary sources.\" He does mention P kk Heiau, once the main royal temple in Honolulu; this heiau would have been located around the foot ( makai end ) of Fort Street. He does not list Pu'ukea or Ka'ahaimauli Heiau, but he does note that Peter Corney, a visitor to the island in 1819, saw several heiau (morai ) along the Honolulu shore: There are several morais, or churches in the village, and at new moon the priests, chiefs and hikanees (aikane) [counselo rs] enter them with offerings of hogs, plantains, and cocoanuts, which they se t before the wooden images. The place is fenced in, and have pieces of white fl ags flying on the fences [Corney 1896:101]. 3.1.5 Trails John Papa ' ' mentions some of the previously desc ribed place names while discussing early nineteenth century trails in the Honolulu/Waik k area (Figure 10 and Figu re 11). The fact that a trail traversed th is region - characterized by ponds, marshlands and lo'i - suggests that the trail, especially as it neared the coastline at K lia, must have run on a sand berm raised above surrounding wetlands and coral flats. The middle tra il (probably close to the current alignment of Queen Street), was described walking from Waik k to Honolulu as: The trail from Kalia led to Kukuluaeo, then along the graves of those who died in the smallpox epidemic of 1853, and into the center of the coconut grove of Honuakaha. On the upper side of the tra il was the place of Kinau, the father of Kekauonohi. [' ' 1959:89] The grave site referred to is the Honuakaha Cemetery at the makai corner of Halekauwila and South Streets, makai of Kawaiaha'o Church and northwe st of the current project area. Honuakaha was a settlement located generall y between Punchbowl and South Streets, on the makai side of Queen Street. The lower, coastal trail, was described walking from Honolulu towards Waik k as: From the makai side of Kaoaopa was a trail to the sea at Kakaako, where stood the homes of the fishermen. Below the trail lived Hehehewa and his fellow kahunas. [' ' 1959:89] 3.1.6 Early Post-Contact Histor y and Population Centers The modern urban area known as Kaka'ako is located between two longtime centers of population: Honolulu, known as Ko u in older times, and Waik k. In Waik k, a system of taro lo'i (irrigated terraces) fed by stre ams descending from Makiki, M noa, and P lolo Valleys covered the coastal plain, and networks of fis hponds dotted the shoreline. Similarly, Kou - the area of downtown Honolulu surrounding the ha rbor - possessed shoreward fishponds and irrigated fields watered by streams descendi ng from Nu'uanu and Pauoa Valleys. The pre- contact population and land-use patterns of the Kaka'ako area may have derived from its Cultural Surveys Hawai' i Job Code: KAKAAKO 13 Background Research Archaeological Assessment, Place Project, Kaka'ako, Honolulu, O'ahu 25 TMK [1] 2-1-051:009 por.

Thus, the attempt to reconstruct the region as it existed for the Hawaiians during the centuries be fore western contact must begin with accounts of Kou and Waik k. Waikk is actually the name of the large ahupua'a (land division) encompassing lands stretching from Honolulu to Mauna lua Bay. By the time of the arrival of Europeans during the late eighteenth century, th e area today known as Waik k had long been a ce nter of population and political power on O'ahu. Acco rding to Beckwith (1940:383), by the end of the fourteenth century, Waik k had become \"the ruling seat of the chiefs of O'ahu.\" The pre-eminence of Waikk continued into the eighteenth century and is confirmed by the decision of Kamehameha I, in the midst of unifying control of the islands, to reside there after wresting control of O'ahu by defeating the island's chief, Kalanik pule. Chiefly residences were only one element of a complex of features sustaining a large population that characterized Waik k through pre-contact times. Beginning in the fifteenth century, a vast system of irrigated taro fields was constructed, extending across the littoral plain from Waik k to lower M noa and P lolo Valleys. This field syst em, an impressive feat of engineering, the design of which is traditi onally attributed to the chief Kalamakua, took advantage of streams de scending from Makiki, M noa, and P lolo Valleys, which also provided ample fresh water for the Hawaiians living in the ahupua'a . Water was also available from springs in nearby M 'ili'ili and Punahou. Closer to the Waik k shoreline, coconut groves and fishponds dotted the landscape. A continuous z one of population and cultivation, from the shoreline of present day Waik k Beach, extended north well into M noa Valley. The western and eastern bounds of this zone are less clear, and there are no specific references to Waik k's abundance reaching into the Ka' kaukukui region. A basic description of Honolulu, or Kou, up to we stern contact, is given by E. S. Craighill and Elizabeth Handy: What is now Honolulu was originally that flatland area between the lower ends of Nu'uanu and Pauoa Valleys and the harb or. Westervelt...wrote that \"'Honolulu' was probably a name given to a very rich district of farm land near what is now...the junction of Liliha and School St reets, because its chief was Honolulu, one of the high chiefs at the time of K kuhihewa...It is probable that the chief referred to by Westervelt took his name from the harbor and adjoining land. The original name of the land where the town grew when the harbor became a haven for foreign ships was Kou...The number of heiau in this area indicates that it was a place of first importance before the era of foreign contact. [Handy and Handy 1972:479] Rev. Hiram Bingham, arriving in Honolulu in 1820, described a still predominantly native Hawaiian environment - still a \"village\" - on th e brink of western-i nduced transformations: We can anchor in the roadstead abreast of Honolulu village, on the south side of the island, about 17 miles from the eastern extremity...Passing through the irregular village of some thousands of inhabitants, whose grass thatched habitations were mostly small and mea n, while some were more spacious, we walked about a mile northwardly to th e opening of the valley of Pauoa, then Cultural Surveys Hawai' i Job Code: KAKAAKO 13 Background Research Archaeological Assessment, Place Project, Honolulu, O'ahu 28 TMK [1] 2-1-051:009 por. turning southeasterly, ascending to the top of Punchbowl Hill, an extinguished crater, whose base bounds th e northeast part of the vill age or town...Below us, on the south and west, spread the plain of Honolulu, having its fishponds and salt making pools along the seashore, the village and fort between us and the harbor, and the valley stretching a few miles north into the interior, which presented its scattered habitations and numerous beds of kalo (arum esculentum) in its various stages of growth, with its large green leaves, beautifully embossed on the silvery water, in which it flour ishes. [Bingham 1847:92-93] The Ka'kaukukui area would have been in Bingham' s view as he stood atop \"Punchbowl Hill\" looking toward Waik k to the south; it would have comprised part of the area he describes as the 'plain of Honolulu' with its \"fishponds and salt ma king pools along the seashore.\" Another visitor to Honolulu in the 1820s, Capt . Jacobus Boelen, hints at the possible pre- Contact character of Honolulu a nd its environs, including the Ka' kaukukui area: It would be difficult to say much about Honoruru. On its sout hern side is the harbor or the basin of that name (which as a result of variations in pronunciation [sic] is also written as Honolul u, and on some maps, Honoonoono). The landlocked side in the northwest consists mo stly of taro fields. More to the north there are some sugar plantations and a sugar mill, worked by a team of mules. From the north toward the east, where th e beach forms the bight of Whytetee, the soil around the village is less fertile, or at least not greatly cultivated. [Boelen 1988:62] Boelen's description implies that the Ka' kaukukui area is within a \"not greatly cultivated\" region of Honolulu, perhaps extending from P owaina (Punchbowl Crater) at the north, through Kaka'ako, to the K lia portion of Waik k in the east. An early, somewhat generalized, depiction of the pre-Contact native Hawaiian shaping of Waikk, Kou (Honolulu), and the Kaka'ako area is shown on an 1817 map (Figure 12) by Otto von Kotzebue (1821), commande r of the Russian ship Rurick , who had visited O'ahu the previous year. The map shows taro lo'i (illustrated as rectangles, representing irrigated fields) massed around the streams descending from Nu'uanu and M noa valleys. The depicted areas of population and habitation concentra tion (illustrated as the trap ezoids) probably reflect early historic-era patterns, unl ike those of pre-contact times, influe nced by the post-contact shift of the population to the area around Honolulu harbor - th e only sheltered landing for large western- sized vessels on O'ahu and the center of incr easing trade with vis iting foreign vessels. Kamehameha himself had moved from Waik k to Honolulu in 1809. Kotzebue's map illustrates that the land between P owaina (Punchbowl Crater) and the shoreline - which would include the Ka' kaukukui area - formed a \"break\" between the heavily populated and cultivated centers of Honolulu and Waik k. The area is characterized by fishponds, salt ponds, trails connecting Honolulu and Waik k, and occasional taro lo'i and habitation sites. An 1855 map of Honolulu by Joseph de LaPasse, a lieutenant aboard the French vessel, L`Eurydice , pictures the project parcels within an area labeled within an area labeled \"Pecheries\" (\"Fishponds\") (Figure 13).

A clearer picture of Ka' kaukukui develops with accounts of other visitors to, and settlers of, Honolulu during the first half of the nineteenth century. Gorman D. Gilman, who arrived in Honolulu in 1841, recalled in a memoir th e limits of Honolulu during the early 1840s: The boundaries of the old town may be said to have been, on the makai [seaward] side, the waters of the har bor; on [inland] side , Beretania street; on Waikk [east] side, the barren and dusty plain [i.e. the area just beyond Punchbowl Street], and on [Gilman describes the \"barren and dus ty plain\" beyond (east of) Punchbowl Street: The next and last street running parall el [he had been describing the streets running mauka -makai , or from the mountains to the shore] was that known as Punchbowl Street. There was on the entire le ngth of this street, from the makai side to the slopes of Punchbowl, but one residence, the two-story house of Mr. Henry Diamond, mauka of King Street. Be yond the street was the old Kawaiahao church and burying ground. A more forsak en, desolate looking place than the latter can scarcely be imagined. One, to see it in its pres ent attractiveness of fences, trees and shrubbery, can hardly believe its former desolation, when without enclosure, horses a nd cattle had free access to the whole place. [Gilman 1904:89] That the environs of the missionary enclave a nd Kawaiaha'o Church we re indeed \"forsaken\" and \"desolate looking\" in the 1820s when the missiona ries first settled there is also noted in the memoirs of the American missionary C. S. St ewart who, arriving on Maui after living at the mission, declared Lahaina to be \"like the delights of an Eden\" after \"four weeks residence on the dreary plain of Honoruru\" (Stewart 1970:177). It is likely that these descriptions of the Honolulu plain also include the Ka' kaukukui region. The barrenness of the Kaka'ako area is also il lustrated in two sketches, one made in 1834 when Kawaiaha'o Church was still a long grass- thatched building (Figure 14), and one made in 1850 after the grass hut had been re placed by a large coral stone st ructure with a steeple (Figure 15). Between Kawaiaha'o Church and the sea, wh ich is the Kaka'ako area, there are only a few scattered huts along the shore a nd aligned along the in land trail (now covered by King Street). An 1887 photograph of the area also shows the mars hy nature of the area, with only scattered houses near the ponds or near the shore makai of Kawaiaha'o Church (Figure 16). 3.1.7 Mid 19th Century and the M hele Among the first descriptions of Ka' kaukukui by the Hawaiians themselves are the testimonies recorded during the 1840s in documents associated with Land Commission Awards (LCA) and awardees of the M hele. The LCA records indicate that the traditional Hawaiian usage of the region and its environs may have been confined to salt making and farming of fishponds, with some wetland ag riculture in those areas mauka or toward Waik k at the very limits of the field system descending from Makiki and M noa valleys. However, the testimonies do indicate that the area was lived-on and was shaped by Hawa iians before the nineteenth century. The LCA records also reveal that midway through the nine teenth century, taro Cultural Surveys Hawai' i Job Code: KAKAAKO 13 Background Research Archaeological Assessment, Place Project, Kaka'ako, Honolulu, O'ahu 32 TMK [1] 2-1-051:009 por.

These activities and the land f eatures that supported them would later be eliminated, or buried, during the remainder of the nineteenth century by the urbanization of Honolulu. The LCA records, historic maps, and archival photographs docu ment more precisely traditional Hawaiian settlement and subsequent hi storic land usage within and around the current project area. The Organic Acts of 1845 and 1846 initiated the process of the M hele - the division of Hawaiian lands - which introduced private proper ty into Hawaiian society. In 1848, the crown, the Hawaiian government, and the ali'i (chiefs) received their land ti tles. The current project area is located in the land section of Pu'unui, within Land Commission Award 7713, as shown on Figure 17. An 1876 map of the ' ili of Ka'kaukukui and Pu'unui (see Fi gure 9) shows that the current project area is in an area of salt pans, with no kuleana lots to commoners, and no habitation structures. All habitation lots near Ka' kaukukui and Kukulu e'o are located in clusters near Queen Street, with most in the settlement at Honuakaha, or further inland along King Street, as shown on an 1884 map (Fi gure 17) and an 1887 map (Figure 18). The ' ili of Ka'kaukukui (LCA 7713) was awarded to Victoria Kam malu, the sister of Kamehameha IV and Kamehameha V. Ka' kaukukui consisted of three non-contiguous sections, a type of ' ina (land) called a lele. An early surveyor for the Hawaiian Government Survey office explains about lele in general, and Ka' kaukukui in particular: There were two features of the ili, referred to by the terms lele...the ili often consisted of several distinct sections of land\u2014one, for instance, on the seashore, another on dry, open land, or kula, another in the regularl y terraced and watered kalo patch or aina loi district, and another still in the forest, thus again carrying out the equable division system whic h we have seen in the ahupuaa. These separate pieces were called, lele, i.e., \"jumps,\" and were most common on O'ahu...Kaakaukukui held Fisherman's Point and the present har bor of Honolulu; then kalo land near the present Kukui street , and also a large tract of forest at the head of Pouoa [Pauoa] Valley... These different pieces were called variousl y, either by their own individual name or by that of the whole ili, thus puzzling one sadly when attempting to obtain information with respect to them. [Lyons 1894:1697] There are no kuleana awards to commoners within LC A 7713. The award also included the southern portion of the ' ili of Pu'unui and a large fishpond (labeled Loko Ka' kaukukui) surrounded by land in the ' ili of 'Auwaiolimu. Loko Ka' kaukukui was probably a fishpond fed by spring-water, but the ot her ponds in 7713, Loko Kaimukanaka, Loko Kalokoeli, and possibly Loko Kuaimeki, were probably salt ponds filled by tidal waters. There are no houses within LCA 7713 shown on the 1874-1891 maps. Th ere are two structures labeled \"Salt Houses,\" presumably for drying or storing salt, and a few other st ructures associated with the wharfs and the Marine Railway leading to the r eef. This land does not seem to have been used during this period for habitation.

The ' ili of Pu'unui, which also had several lele lands, included the larg e rectangular section in the center of the 1876 Lyons map (see Figure 9). The mauka portion of Pu'unui was a portion of LCA 677 to Matio Kek anao'a, a high ali'i who was a close friend to Kamehameha II and was married to K na'u, the daughter of Kamehameha I . Also on the 1876 Lyons map, LCA 2045 is shown within Pu'unui. This lot was awarded to Kauw ahi, who received the pa rcel in the time of Kamehameha I. There are three LCA Awards shown on maps as being located on the northwestern border of Ka'kaukukui. In the M hele testimony, these awards ar e listed as within the ' ili of Kaka'ako. LCA 4457 to Ana Kaloa, inhabited by her family si nce the days of Kamehameha I, consisted of four fishponds, an ' auwai (irrigation ditch) and a house encl osed by a fence. LCA 3455 to Kaule for Liliha, inherited from Kamehameha I, consisted of a houselot ( phale) bound by the sea and the mouth of a stream ( muliwai ). LCA 247, a house lot, was clai med by Charles Kana'ina for W. C Lunalilo, who received his land before the M hele from his mother ( mamua loa ). Kana'ina was a friend to Kamehameha II and married his fifth wife Kek uluohi. Their son was Lunalilo, who became the sixth monarch of Hawai'i. The ' ili of Pualoalo, or Puaaloalo , (LCA 10605-A) was awarded to Iona was an ali'i, a retainer of Kauikeaouli (Kamehameha III), and held several government posts. It consisted of three lele lands, two in Nu'uanu Valley and a parcel shown on the 1876 Lyons map (see Figure 9), bordering the northeast corner of Ka' kaukukui. On the 1884 Bishop map (see Figure 17), four houses are shown on this property. The ' ili of Ka'ala'a, northwest of the current pr oject area, was awarded to Beneli (Bennett) Nmakeh, a member of Kamehameha II's privy c ouncil. He was the uncle of Queen Emma (wife of Kamehameha IV) and the first husba nd of Kapi'olani, who later married King Kal kaua, the seventh Hawaiian monarch (Kame' eleihiwa 1992:276.) In his will, N makeh gave the lele of Ka'ala'a to his widow Kapi'olani. In a legal suit concerning the property, the lele is described as: ...a piece of land situate at Honuakaha, Honolulu, and containing an area of 1.6 acres. The property consisted formerly of a fishpond and its banks and, perhaps, a small piece, additional, of dry land, and was a lele of the Ili of Kaalaa... ...from 1852 or, perhaps, 1850, (Kapiola ni and Namakeha married in 1850) Kapiolani at various times had the pond cleaned out, that her servants by her direction fished therein and delivered th e fish to her for her use, that she sometimes gave them some of the fish, that she erected a small building on the bank of the pond or on the kula adjoining, that a man employed and directed by her to care for and the care of the pond occasionally lived in that building, and that she at times objected to horses bei ng pastured on the kula of the pond because the animals might enter the pond and cause injury to it. [Haw aii Supreme Court 1903:321, 324] The ' ili of 'Auwaiolimu, which consisted of several lele, was awarded to Kalaeokekoi. He later returned the land to the government, and it subsequently became Crown Land. Kalaeokekoi was married to the Kaulahua, who is believed to be the niece of Charles Kana'ina (awarded LCA 247 in Kaka'ako). Cultural Surveys Hawai' i Job Code: KAKAAKO 13 Background Research Archaeological Assessment, Place Project, Kaka'ako, Honolulu, O'ahu 38 TMK [1] 2-1-051:009 por. A large section of the ' ili of Honuakaha was awarded to Mataio Kek anao'a (father of Victoria Kam malu), with the remainder of the 'ili divided into small lots. This was the main habitation area to the east of central Honolulu, and is noted as a village as early as 1810 (' ' 1959:92). The Waihona ' ina database notes seven awards in the ' ili of Honuakaha, though additional awards in this 'ili extended on both sides of Punchbow l Street. In many of the awards the 'ili name is not given, only the loca tion on Punchbowl or Queen Street. The ' ili of 'pua was not awarded to one person. LCA 704, between the two long fishponds in the northwest of the study par cels, was located within the ' ili of 'pua. The claim is for a houselot to Honaunau, which he rece ived prior to the death of K na'u in 1837. The ' ili of Kukulu e'o (LCA 387) was awarded to the Am erican Board of Commissioners for Foreign Missions (ABCFM). Initially this la nd was associated with Punahou School in M noa Valley, as Chief Boki gave the Punahou lands to Hiram Bingham, pastor of Kawaiaha'o Church in 1829 (DeLeon 1978:3). In the M hele, however, this sea land became \"detached\" from the Mnoa award and was instead given to the pastor of the Kawaia ha'o Church, as noted in a history of the Punahou School (P unahou School and Oahu College 1866). Curtis Perry Ward, a native of Kentucky, came to the Hawaiian Isla nds in 1853, and soon established a livery and draying business. In 1865, he bought a large 12 -acre estate mauka of King Street. Sometime before 1875, Ward added to his property with the purchase of 77 acres and 3,000 feet of ocean frontage in the ' ili of Kukulu e'o, makai of Queen Street. LCA 982 to Kukao, immediatedly northeast of th e current project area, is shown on the 1876 Lyons map (see Figure 9) as being located in the Pu'unui area. However, according to the Mhele testimony, it was within the ' ili of Kukulu e'o. Kukao testified that it had four houses on the fenced lot, one belonging to him, one to th e witness, Auhili, and one to a man named Koke. The property had been passed down from his fath er, who lived in the time of Kamehameha I. The ' ili of Kewalo (LCA 10605) was awarded to Ka make'e Pi'ikoi, wife of Jonah Pi'ikoi (awardee of Pualoalo 'Ili), as part of LCA 10605, ' pana (lot) 7. The award was shared between husband and wife (Kame'eleihiwa 1992:269). Kewalo was a large 270.84-acre land section extending from Kawaiaha'o Church to Sheridan Street. This land section had numerous large fishponds, which were awarded as part of the claim to Pi'ikoi. In summary, the current project area is completely within LCA 7713 to Victoria Kam malu, which included the Ka' kaukukui area and the southern portion of the coastal Pu'unui area. The current project area was within or adjacent to la rge salt marsh, where salt pans were constructed using the tidal waters. The main habitation con centration for this general area was in the old settlement of Honuakaha, near the junction of Punchbowl and Queen Streets. Late nineteenth century maps do show some scattered houselots in the ' ili of Pu'unui, Pual oalo, Kaka'ako, and 'pua, in the vicinity of the cu rrent project area. Some of th ese may have belonged to the caretakers of the fishponds a nd salt ponds in the area. 3.1.8 The 1874 Transit of Venus Observatory at ' pua On the 1876 map of Ka' kaukukui (see Figure 9), an area labeled \"Transit of Venus\" yard and \"Observatory\" is labeled for a lot northwest of th e current project area. On other historic maps, this land section is called ' pua. This lot was used to house a large portabl e observatory in 1874, Cultural Surveys Hawai' i Job Code: KAKAAKO 13 Background Research Archaeological Assessment, Place Project, Kaka'ako, Honolulu, O'ahu 39 TMK [1] 2-1-051:009 por. an event of so much interest that the lot contin ued to be labeled as th e Transit of Venus yard many years after the portable observatory had been dismantle d (Figure 19 and Figure 20). In 1874, several astronomical teams from Great Brita in traveled to different parts of the world to observe a rare transit of the planet Venus across the sun. The \"purpose of the observations was to better determine the value of the astr onomical unit (AU)\u2014the Earth-sun distance\u2014and thereby the solar syst em\" (Chauvin 2004:xii). This project attracted enormous interest in Hawai'i, and members of the Hawaiian Government Survey worked with the British team, who set up observatories on Hawa i'i, Kaua'i, and O'ahu Islands. Each station needed an equatorial telescope, other telescopes, a transit instrument, an altazimuth (surrounded by a portable wooden observatory with a revolvi ng dome), and several clocks, chronometers, compasses, micrometers, reflecting circles, and artificial horizons (Chauvin 2004:51, 60). Upon reaching Honolulu, the British team of seven astronomers temporarily moved into the Hawaiian Hotel in downtown Honolulu, and began to look about for a proper place to set up their O'ahu observatory. King Kal kaua, who strongly supported the proj ect, gave them permission to use a piece of land in the ' ili of 'pua. Captain Tupman, head of the expedition wrote: Difficulty was experienced in finding a suitable place of observation, as I considered it of great impor tance that the observers shou ld be lodged very close to the instruments; and house accommodation is rather limited. However we have been enabled to rent a cottage belonging to the Princess Ruth, Governess of Molokai, capable of accommodating the H ead Station observers, and adjoining some land owned by His Majesty the King who had kindly given us permission to erect our instruments Etc. and enclose as much land as may be necessary. [cited in Chauvin 2004:76-77] The land in question was a 0.3-acre \"open piece of grass land in the district called Apua. south of Punchbowl street, and west of Queen Street.\" Several build ings were erected, including a barracks and workshop, a cookhouse, a photo hut thatch ed with grass, the stages (platforms) for the instruments, and a wooden pali sade to enclose the lot. The observations of the Transit of Venus on December 8, 1874 in Honolulu were a grea t success, and the British party was feted by the king and other prominent families of Hawai'i. All that was left was to dismantle the temporary buildings at ' pua. Tupman wrote: Mar. 13. The sale. Our hous ehold goods sold well, many friends desiring to obtain a memento of our visit. The long shed, Cook house, walls of huts, transit hut complete, water pipes & taps, 6-foot fencing and a large pile of lumber were knocked down to His Majesty the King for a very small sum, as no one would bid against him. We were not altogether sorry for this as His Majesty has given us the land rent free & had aided us in many ways tending to save expense to the British Government. [cited in Chauvin 2004:124] 3.1.9 Kaka'ako Salt Works and the Salt Pans of Kewalo and Kukulu e'o As noted in the Land Commission Award testimony, much of the land in Ka' kaukukui was used to produce salt. The Hawaiians used pa'akai (salt) for a variety of purposes: to flavor food, to preserve fish by salting, for medicines, a nd for ceremonial purposes. David Malo described the traditional method of making salt: Cultural Surveys Hawai' i Job Code: KAKAAKO 13 Background Research Archaeological Assessment, Place Project, Kaka'ako, Honolulu, O'ahu 40 TMK [1] 2-1-051:009 por.

[Malo 2006:73] Translation Pa'akai (salt) is another be neficial item. It is used to make fish delicious and tasteless foods edible. Pa'akai is made at a particular place, [but] it [salt] is not actually made from this spot , rather it [salt water] came from the sea. A woman went to get some when the sea crashed [ upon the rocks] and she ran back [the salt water] to this particular spot. That salt water (kai) is placed in, perhap s, a depression (poho) or a \"Bird's nest\" (keha) or rock basin (k heka) and allowed to evaporate (liu). Then it is taken to another spot and is formed into pa'akai. Wooden boards (papa l 'au) are used to pound ( mashed ) 1903, Nathaniel Emerson translated David Malo 's articles on early Hawaiian life. In his publication, the translations are no t literal, but include informati on that Emerson added to clarify the accounts. In Emerson's translation: Salt was one of the necessities and was a c ondiment used with fish and meat, also as a relish with fresh food. Salt was manuf actured in certain places. The women brought sea-water in calabashes, or c onducted it in ditches to natural holes, hollows and shallow ponds ( kekaha ) on the sea-coast, where it soon became strong brine from evaporation. Thence it was transferred to another hollow or shallow vat, where crys tallization into salt was completed. [Malo 1951:123] Captain Cook was the first to note the met hod of making salt in prepared \"saltpans\": Amongst their arts, we must not forget th at of making salt, with which we were amply supplied, during our stay at these islands, and which was perfectly good of its kind. Their saltpans are made of earth, lined with clay; bei ng generally six or eight feet square, and about eight inch es deep. They are raised upon a bank of stones near the high-water mark, from wh ence the salt water is conducted to the foot of them, in small tren ches, out of which they are filled, and the sun quickly performs the necessary process of evapor ation...Besides the quantity we used in salting pork, we filled all our empty casks , amounting to sixteen puncheons, in the Resolution only. [Cook 1784:151] In the next years after the fi rst sightings of the Hawaiian Islands by Captain Cook in 1778, most visitors to the islands were British and American fur-traders, who stopped at Hawai'i on their way to China. One reason for their visit was to stock up on food and water, but another concern was to buy or trade for salt, which was used to cure the seal and mammal pelts collected Cultural Surveys Hawai' i Job Code: KAKAAKO 13 Background Research Archaeological Assessment, Place Project, Kaka'ako, Honolulu, O'ahu 42 TMK [1] 2-1-051:009 por. from the Northwest Coast. During Kotzebue's visit in 1816 and 1817, he noted that \"Salt and sandalwood were the chief items of export\" (in Thrum 1905:50). The journals of none mention the object of call other than for refreshments, though one, 3 some years later, records the scarcity and high price of salt at the several points touched at, with which to se rve them in the curing of furs obtained on the coast. In all probability salt was the first article of export trade of the islands and an object, if not the object, of these pioneer fur-traders' call. [Thrum 1905:45]. The missionary William Ellis, on a tour of th e Hawaiian Islands in 1822 and 1823, also noted these salt pans and recorded the final step of crystallization: The natives of this district (Kawaihae) manufacture large quantities of salt, by evaporating the sea water. We saw a numb er of their pans, in the disposition of which they display great in genuity. They have generally one large pond near the sea, into which the water flows by a cha nnel cut through the rocks, or is carried thither by the natives in large calabashes. After remaining there for some time, it is conducted into a number of smaller pans about six or eight inches in depth, which are made with great ca re, and frequently lined w ith large evergreen leaves, in order to prevent absorption. Along th e narrow banks or partitions between the different pans, we saw a number of large evergreen leaves placed. They were tied up at each end, so as to resemble a narrow dish, and filled with sea water, in which the crystals of salt were abundant. [Ellis 1827:403-404] In an article on Hawaiian salt works, Thomas Thrum discusses the large salt works at lia Pa'akai (Salt Lake in Moanalua) and at Pu'ulo a on the western loch of Pearl Harbor. Kamakau (1961:409) reported \"The king and Isaac of Pu'u loa are getting rich by running the salt water into patches and trading salt with other islands.\" The salt was sent to Ru ssian settlements in the Pacific Northwest, where it was used to pack salmon ( Hawaiian Gazette, January 29, 1897). Thrum also mentions a salt works in Kaka'ako. Honolulu had another salt-making section in early days, known as the Kakaako salt works, the property of Kamehameha IV, but leased to and conducted by E.O. Hall, and subsequently E.O. Hall & Son, until comparatively recent years. This enterprise was carried on very much afte r the ancient method of earth saltpans as described by Cook and Ellis. [Thrum 1924:116] In the testimony for LCA 1903, Lolopi claimed two lia (salt beds), 15 ho'oliu (drains), two poho kai (depressions where salt is gathered) and 1 salt kula (dryland or wasteland). Four separate types of salt features are mentioned: th e ponds near the shore that fill with salt water at high tide ( lia); the drains ( ho'oliu ) where the salt water is transfer red to smaller clay-lined or leaf-lined channels; the natura l depressions (or modified depr essions) in the rocks along the shore where salt formed naturally; and the salt kula, which was waste land, land that could probably not be used for agriculture as it was impregnated with salt. Lolopi did not live near his salt lands, but Pahiha, claimant of LCA 1504, did have a house near his fish pond and salt bed. The house was probably a simple grass hut, simila r to those shown on an 1838 sketch entitled \"Honolulu Salt Pans, Near Kakaa ko\" and the one shown on an 184 5 sketch of the \"Old Salt Cultural Surveys Hawai' i Job Code: KAKAAKO 13 Background Research Archaeological Assessment, Place Honolulu, O'ahu 43 TMK [1] 2-1-051:009 por. Pans\" (Figure 21 and Figure 22). These sketches s how the traditional, lo ng salt ponds parallel to the shore. The export of salt declined in the late ninet eenth century. Thrum (192 4:116) states that the apex of the trade was in 1870, but by 1883 he no ted that \"pulu, salt and oil have disappeared entirely\" from the list of yearly exports (Thrum 1884:68). By 1916, only one salt works, the Honolulu Salt Co., was still in operation. However, salt continued to be manufactured for local use. The Kaka'ako Salt Works appears on maps as late as 1891 and a page in Victoria Ward's ledger for 1883 notes a yearly income of $651.50 received from her \"Salt Lands\" Thrum (1924:116) said the Honolulu Salt Co. was the only salt producer on O'ahu in 1916. A 1916 Commerce Report (Taylor 1916:723) states that the Honolulu Salt Co. operates \"salt beds at Puuloa, Kalihi, and Waikiki, on the island of O'ahu...\" No mention is made of Kaka'a ko, suggesting that the Kaka'ako salt works had closed before 1916. The traditional method of salt production was gr adually replaced by the more labor intensive Chinese method, as the Chinese immigrants began to take over the traditional salt and fish ponds of Honolulu in order to grow rice, to raise ducks, and to ma ke salt. In a 1906 article, Rev. Westervelt (1906:43-46) explained the Chinese me thod of salt evaporation for the Honolulu salt beds. The Chinese worker first used a water pump to draw the seawater from the larger ditch below to the salt-evaporation be ds above. The man moved the tw o handles back and forth to work the pump. The evaporation beds were lined with clay, wet with sea water, and tramped and pounded down. Each pan was about 20 feet square, co vered with about two in ches of water, and bound by an earth dyke, as shown in old photograph of the Kewalo salt brin e beds (Figure 23). On early historic maps, the area of salt pans is often marked out as a large grid of contiguous squares, as shown on an 1883 map (Figure 24). After allowing the sun to evaporate some of the water, the worker stepped into the evaporation pan and scraped the salt into a pile in the center with a simple wooden scraper. The worker then threw a large basket-shaped scoop into the brine and used a tin dipper to move the salt to the basket. Two baskets, one on each side of a pole, were then carried on the back of a worker across the thin earth dykes between the salt pans. The baskets were dumped into large drying piles, where the remaining water seeped out into the ground. The salt was then sewn into gunny sacks and sent to the market for sale. By 1901, most of the fishponds and salt pans makai of King Street were reported as abandoned. In that year, the Hawa i'i Legislature (1901:185) proposed to build a ditch to drain away the \"foul and filthy water that overflows that district at the present time.\" The district makai of King St. and the Catholic Cemetery, Ewa of Mrs. Ward's (the Old Plantation), mauka of Clayton St ., and Waikiki of the land from King St., leading to the Hoomananaauao Church, c onsists of six large abandoned fish ponds and a large number of smaller ones, all in filthy condition, fed by springs and flowing into Peck's ditches. Just maka i of these ponds, at the end of Clayton street, next to Mr. Ward's, is Peck's pl ace. An artesian well flushing the wash houses flows into two foul ditches, th ence to the big pond which is Waikiki of what used to be Cyclomere and next to Mrs. Ward's line [ditch] extending down to Waimanu St. Cultural Surveys Hawai' i Job Code: KAKAAKO 13 Background Research Archaeological Assessment, Place Project, Kaka'ako, Honolulu, O'ahu 44 TMK [1] 2-1-051:009 por.

These ponds, with the exception of three, are abandoned. 3.1.10 Kaka'ako's Role as a Human Quar antine Center and Cemetery Area The city block now bounded by Punchbowl Street , Pohukaina Street, South Street, and Ala Moana Boulevard (now covered by the Waterfront Plaza complex), west of the current project area, was used as a cemetery from the 1700s (or earlier) up to the early 1800s. This is based on an analysis of artifacts from ei ght burials disinterred at the site (Griffin et al. 1987:4). The burial ground is currently refe rred to as the \"Ka' kaukukui Cemetery,\" but its ancient name, if it had one, is unknown. During the 1853 smallpox epidemic, patients were isolated at a temporary quarantine camp and a hospital was set up at Kaka'ako (Thrum 1897: 98). Victims of the dise ase were later buried at the Honuakaha Cemetery near the modern junc tion of Quinn Lane and South Street (Griffin et al. 1987:13; Pfeffer et al. 1993; Hammatt and Pfeffer 1993). Hansen's (i.e. leprosy) was first re ported in Hawai'i 1840, and positively identified in 1853. During the next 25 years (i.e. 1853-1878), th ere were approximately 160 cases per year, and 80 cases per year over the next 50 year s (i.e. 1878-1928). The number of cases later decreased to 60 cases per year in 1931 and 20 cases a year in 1951 (Arnold 1956:317). In 1865, a receiving hospital in Kalihi, west of Honolulu, was set up to examine suspected lepers. If the diagnosis was confirmed, the patients were forcib ly exiled to the Kalaupapa colony on Moloka'i. In cases where it was uncertain if the patient had le prosy or some other type of skin disease, the stay at the hospital could extend into weeks while the doctors waited for definite symptoms of leprosy to develop. A branch hospital and receiv ing station for cases of Hansen's Disease was opened in 1881 at Kaka'ako, w ithin the city block now bound by Ala Moana Boulevard, Keawe Street, Auahi Street, and Coral Street (Griffin et al. 1987:55), with 48 patients tended by Dr. George L. Fitch (Hanley and Bushnell 1980:112). This land, at \"Fisherman's by Princess Ruth Ke'elik lani. The \"Leper Hospital\" is indicated on the 1884 map of Honolulu (see Figure 17). One of the main purposes of the Kaka'ako Dete ntion Center was to keep suspected lepers isolated from the general pubic. Sister Leopoldina, a Franciscan sister, described the Kaka'ako Hospital in 1885 as being lik e a prison, enclosed by: ...a high close board fence and large strong locked gates...A large building [sat] over those gates where the lepers were allowed to talk with their relatives through prison bars. No one was allowed to ente r without a permit from the Board of Health. [cited in Hanley and Bushnell 1980:114] As the complex was constructed on a former salt marsh near the sea, it was subject to flooding at high tide. The salt water killed all vegetation an d made it impossible to landscape the complex with grass or plants; the water swept away ston e-bordered paths, corrode d metal, and destroyed the whitewash on the buildings. Even so, the Board of Health expected the pa tients to help feed themselves by growing their own vegetables in gardens on the center's grounds. Overcrowding was also a problem. The hospital, built to house 100 patients, had over 200 residents by 1883. Cultural Surveys Hawai' i Job Code: KAKAAKO 13 Background Research Archaeological Assessment, Place Project, Honolulu, O'ahu 48 TMK [1] 2-1-051:009 por. Dr. Fitch was in favor of making the Kaka'ako station a permanent leprosarium, and often delayed sending confirmed lepers to Molokai. In 1883, Walter Murray Gibson, a minister in King Kal kaua's government and head of the Board of Health, sent out a plea for a religious or der to care for the sick of Hawai'i, especially the lepers. The call was answered by the Franci scan Sisters of Syracuse, New York, led by Mother Marianne Cope. The seven sisters arrived in Honolulu and made their first visit to the Kaka'ako Leper Detention Center in November of 1883. They were appalled with what they saw: tumbled-down cottages, filth and flies in th e dining area, and the stench of the leper's unwashed sores. The hospita l steward, J. J. Van Geisen, took them on a tour: \"Now let me show you the most inte resting place,\" he announced, leading the group to a narrow building that teetered on pilings over the surf. The structure had been divided into three dingy cubicles, with warped floors and windows ghosted by salt spray. The first of the rooms was the \"morgue.\" Van Geisen explaining that when a patient's condition reached a certain point, he was forced into the morgue and remained there until dead. The body was then dragged to the second cubicle, where Fitch performed an autopsy. Finally the remains were moved to the third room, to await a buri al team. [Tayman 2006:143] The sisters later built a convent at the hospital to live near their patients. The convent was a two-story house with a hall, parlor, and refector y on the ground floor, and five bedrooms upstairs. A small chapel was attached to the rear of the structure, dedicated to Saint Philomena. The sisters soon took the running of the hosp ital in hand, cleaning and whitewashing the cottages, separating the males and females into two wards, and setting up new landscaped areas and gardens (Figure 25). In 1884, Mother Marianne built a home at Kaka'ako for th e non-leprous daughters of the patients at Kaka'ako and the exiled lepers of Mo loka'i (Figure 26). The girls' home was named after Queen Kapi'olani, who supported the plan by raising funds. A two-story dormitory for the girls was built near the sisters' chapel (Hanley and Bushnell 1980:222). In 1888, the Board of Health de cided to close the Kaka'ako Branch, moving the receiving station to Kalihi. They determined that \"the bu ildings at Kakaako should be entirely removed\" (Hanley and Bushnell 1980:275). The hospital a nd several of the larger buildings were dismantled and transported for use at Moloka'i (Daws 1984:xxiii). A few buildings remained and the Kaka'ako site continued to be used as a temporary leprosy receiving station. Thrum (1897:101) reports that victims of the cholera epidemic of 1895 we re treated at the Kaka'ako Hospital, indicating the remaining buildings were modified or a new hospital was built during this time. In 1889, the Kapi'olani School for Gi rls was also moved to Kalihi (Hanley and Bushnell 1980:326). The buildings we re torn down and the new immi gration station was built on the former grounds of the home. In 1899, the first case of bubonic plague was identif ied in Hawai'i; the plague spread rapidly through the crowded tenements of Chinatown. Th e government decided that the best way to eradicate the disease was thr ough \"controlled burning\" of th e wooden buildings. Infected patients were moved to a quarantine camp at Kaka'ako. Some people whose houses were burned, not necessarily patients, were housed at the barracks of the Kaka'ako Rifle Range, and their Cultural Surveys Hawai' i Job Code: KAKAAKO 13 Background Research Archaeological Assessment, Place Project, Kaka'ako, Honolulu, O'ahu 49 TMK Figure photograph of patients' oceanside cottages at the Kaka'ako Leper Center (reprinted in Hanley a nd Bushnell 1980:phot ograph section) Figure 26. 1886 photograph of the Kapi'olani Ho me for Girls within the Kaka'ako Leper Detention Center; Mother Marianne Cope is the second woman from the right (reprinted in Hanley and Bus hnell 1980: photograph section) Cultural Surveys Hawai' i Job Code: KAKAAKO 13 Background Research Archaeological Assessment, Place Project, Kaka'ako, Honolulu, O'ahu 50 TMK [1] 2-1-051:009 belongings were stored in the ce llars of Kaumakapili Church. In January, a fire was set in Block 15 between Kaumakapili Church an d Nu'uanu Avenue, which quickly got out of control. No one was killed in the fire, but Chinatown was destr oyed. Many people were left homeless, and also bereft of all belongings, which were lost when Kaumakapili Church burned to the ground (Iwamoto 1969:122-124, 130-131). In 1905, the Kaka'ako area was used for the in cineration of the waste from urban Honolulu. Thomas Thrum reported: Early in the year was completed the l ong projected garbage crematory for the disposal, daily, of the city's refuse by a pa tent and sanitary pro cess. It is located on the shore of Kakaako, adjoining the se wer pumping station; is two stories in height and built of brick. [Thrum 1906b:177] The dredging of Honolulu harbor and its channel is completed as far as planned for the present, and excavations for the Alakea and Kinau slips finished, the material therefrom being used to fill in a large area of Kakaako and the flats in the vicinity of the sewer pu mping station and garbage crematory. The amount of material removed by the Federal dredgi ng was a million and a half cubic yards [Thrum 1907:148-149]. 3.1.11 Military Works at Ka' kaukukui During the monarchy, the point at Kaka'ako was the location for a battery, with three cannons used to salute visiting naval vessels, whic h responded with their own cannon salutes. Other saluting batteries were at the top of Punc hbowl Crater and at the Honolulu Fort (Dukas 2004:163). The Hawaiian Annual and Almanac for 1887 (Thrum 1887:37) reported that $4,500 had been spent to build the battery, which was used for gun salutes up to at least the end of the monarchy in 1893 (Judd 1975:57), as shown on an 1887 photograph (Figure 27) and a 1887 map of Honolulu (see Figure 18). After the annexation of the Hawa iian Islands by the United Stat es in 1899, the U.S. Congress began to plan for the coastal defenses of thei r new islands. The major batteries were placed at Pearl Harbor and Waik k, but a small reservation, named Fort Armstrong, was also set up on the Ka'kaukukui Reef as a station for the storage of underwater mines. Battery Tiernon, with two 3- inch guns, was built at this site in 1911, and took over the job of saluti ng visiting naval vessels once performed by the Kaka'ako battery (Willi ford and McGovern 2003:15). In 1917, William Castle noted: Fort Armstrong is the saluting station for the port of Honolulu. It is built on the Kaakaukukui Reef, one mile from the centre of the city and at the entrance of the harbour. Its area is 64 acres, and it has as garrison the 104 th Company (mine) of the Coast Artillery Corps. Both offi cers and men are wretchedly housed in temporary board and batten shacks, although the fort has been in use for three years.

Figure 27. 1887 photograph of the Kaka'ako Saluting Battery and flagstaff (original photograph taken by Karl Kortum and archived at the San Francisco Maritime Museum; reprinted in Scott 1968:176) Fort Armstrong saw some small action durin g World War I. In October 1917, military authorities closed Honolulu Harbor betw een sunset and sunrise. The steamer Claudine , which was sailing from Maui when the edict went into effect, sailed into H onolulu Harbor unknowingly after twilight. The coast artillery at Fort Armstrong shot a few shells across her bow, and the steamer quickly reversed her engines and went ba ck out to sea until the following morning, when she could safely and legally come to shore (T homas 1983:147). During the Japanese attack of Hawai'i on December 7, 1941, the Fort Armstrong escaped relatively unscathed. Only one motor pool structure was hit. Anti-aircraft shells were fired from the fort , but were ineffe ctive. At least one shell hit the town rather than any aircra ft (Richardson 2005:34). In the 1950s, the federal government returned most of Fort Armstrong to the Territory of Hawai'i, wh ich used the area to expand the shipping piers of the harbor. 3.1.12 Kerosene Storage Lot and the Magoon Block On the 1887 map of Honolulu (see Figure 18), a lot is indicat ed \"kerosene store house,\" a government facility, located north of the current project area. The danger of locating this storage area so close to downtown Honolulu wa s emphasized by the compiler of the Hawaiian Annual , Thomas Thrum, who noted fires at the kerose ne storage warehouse in 1891, and again in 1907: And, as if to emphasize the critical cond ition of the city, fires have been more numerous than usual, with more serious loss thereby than for years past, the Cultural Surveys Hawai' i Job Code: KAKAAKO 13 Background Research Archaeological Assessment, Place Project, Kaka'ako, Honolulu, O'ahu 52 TMK [1] 2-1-051:009 por. principal one being the government Kerosene Warehouse in the early part of June last, with some 35,000 cases of o il and gasoline. [Thrum 1892:129] Early in August a small building at Kakaa ko of not much value was destroyed by fire. Shortly afterwards, by the prompt re sponse to the firemen to a \"still alarm\" about 8 a.m. of Sunday, the 11th, an ince ndiary blaze in the Kerosene warehouse at Kakaako was quenched just in tim e to avert a serious explosion and conflagration. [Thrum 1908:180-181] On later historic maps, this land section is referred to as the Magoon Grant or the Magoon Block. John Alfred Magoon was a prominent lawy er in Honolulu who married Emmeline Marie Afong, the daughter of a wealthy Chinese busin essman in Hawai'i (Dye 1997:211-212). Like many businessmen, Magoon bought properties as invest ments, for development or for sale for a profit at a later date. Under Kamehameha IV, he received Grant 3182 (0.312 acres) in 1878 for $50, and Grant 3183 (1.89 acres) for $260. By 1914, he built on the Queen Street lot a two-story structure with shops on the ground floor and residential apartments on the top floor (Figure 28), described as \"Hawaii's First Apartment House\" (G riffin et al. 1987:32, 65). Additional structures were built in the early twen tieth century in th e parcel called the \"Magoon Block.\" The apartments were generally low-rent and inhabi ted by bachelors, although some poorer families crowded into the larger apartm ents. All of the build ings on the lot were demolished in 1940. 3.1.13 Honolulu Iron Works In the 1850s, Hawaiian sugar planters became intere sted in a type of centrifugal machine that could separate sugar from molasses. An engin eer named David Weston in stalled his version of this machine in a Maui sugar mill in 1851. W ith backing from Hawaiian businessmen, Weston returned to the islands in 1853 and founded the Honolulu Iron Works (Figure 29), which he set up in a building already occupied by a flour mill (Kuykendall 1938:326-327). The flour mill was at first the most successful part of the business, where wheat from Maui and as far away as Chile was ground into flour and then exported to Califo rnia. However, as the sugar industry became more prominent in the Hawai'i economy, the Iron Works began to build the machinery needed to operate the new sugar mills, not only in Hawai'i but all over the world. At one point, the Iron Works employed 1,500 workers, many who lived in the Kaka'ako area (Nicol 1998:510). Business began to decline in the 1950s, and in 1973 the works were closed (Nicol 1998:510). At first the old buildings were converted to reta il space, but eventually all were torn down; the last warehouse was demolished in 1982 (Kawasaki 2005:2). This main lot for this complex is now covered by One Waterfront Plaza, west of the current project area. 3.1.14 Pohukaina School and Mother Waldron Park In the surveyor's notes for an 1873 map of land parcels at th e corner of King and Punchbowl streets, the present site of the Hawai'i State Pub lic Library, one of the par cels is identified as the \"lot purchased by the Government of Prince Luna lilo in 1872, said portion now to be transferred to the control of the Board of Education.\" The parcel was, in 1874, to become the site of the Pohukaina School for Girls, one of three gove rnment supported schools on O'ahu during the second half of the 19 th century. The other two schools were the Royal School for Boys and the Fort Street School.

Miss S.F. Corney is the Princi pal, and has for assistants Misses W.P. Luce and J. Dudoit. The young folks who attend this school , and through them (by reflected merit, or, rather, as the originators of the merit), their ladylike teachers, lately received a very pretty pat on the back from the Honorable Mr. Bishop, who is President of the Board of E ducation. \"The pupils of this school are generally known out of the school room by thei r neat and tidy appearance,\" was the remark by which, in addition to some decided praise of their application to their studies, he intimated to the Legislative Assembly what benefits they conferred on the community by the Gove rnment grant to the Pohukaina act to esta blish the Library of Hawai'i. After evaluating several possible locations, th e government committee decided that the King Street lot of the Pohukaina School would be the best location. Governor Frear wrote, \"I arranged to have Pohukaina School moved to Kakaako- a more central location with reference to its constituency and with much more space for bu ildings and playgrounds\" (Frear 1938, cited in Schilz 1991). As Gov. Frear noted, Pohukaina School was m oved to Kaka'ako, within the city block bounded by Pohukaina Street, Keawe Street, Halekauwila Street, and Coral Street. The main building was located immediately makai (seaward) of the current pr oject area. Cons tructed at a cost of $28,000, the new school building opened in 1913: The structure which was desi gned by E.C. Petit of the architectural firm headed by H.L. Kerr represents a special study in fire-proofing. It is fitted with specially designed fire walls and doors, with outside staircases. The building is of reinforced concrete and economically planned, the rooms on the second floor being fitted with foldi ng doors to that they may be thrown together. The design permits of the addition of a number of rooms at the rear of the building when an increase in school population makes this necessary. [ Pacific Commercial Advertiser ; June 22, 1913:A1] Pohukaina School remained in operation in Kaka'ako until 1980, by which time it had developed into a special educ ation facility. The buildings were demolished, and in 1981, the Pohukaina School special education program was transferred to the campus of Kaimuk Intermediate School. One of the teachers at the Pohukaina School wa s Margaret Waldron. Mr s. Waldron taught at Pohukaina School for 18 years until her retirement in 1934. She was also not ed for her volunteer work in Kaka'ako, and was \"generally credited w ith being the individual who had most influence in transforming the so-called 'Kakaako gangs' into law abid ing groups and wiping out the unsavory reputation which at one time clung to the district\" ( Honolulu Star-Bulletin ; May 8, 1936:A1). Mrs. Waldron died on May 8, 1936. Th e following year, when a new playground was constructed across Coral Street from Pohukaina School, the H onolulu Board of Supervisors authorized the park's designation as \"Mothe r Waldron Playground.\" At the September 20, 1937 Cultural Surveys Hawai' i Job Code: KAKAAKO 13 Background Research Archaeological Assessment, Place Project, Kaka'ako, Honolulu, O'ahu 55 TMK [1] 2-1-051:009 por. opening of the playground, designed by Harry Sims Bent and constructed on the site of the former County stables at a cost of $50,000: ...officials expressed the hope that the park would be appreciated and enjoyed to the utmost. Reference was made to the dusty roads and barre n lands that had marked the site not many years ago. [ Honolulu Advertiser ; September 21, 1937:A1] The Mother Waldron Playground was then, in 1937, the most modern facility in the Territory. The following year, Lewis Mumford, the noted aut hor and social scientist, was invited by the Honolulu Park Board to study th e county's parks and playgrounds. He noted the \"spirit called forth in the Mother Waldron Playground.\" Mumfor d defined that spirit exemplified by Mother Waldron Playground and other county parks: That the very spirit of play is enhan ced by taking place in a setting that shows order and vision often does not occur to the municipal departments concerned; hence, ugly chicken-wire fences, clay or bare asphalt surfaces, and a complete innocence of all aesthetic device. Honolulu has made a valuable departure from this stale tradition by providing, in some of its new playgrounds, structures that have none of this tawdry makeshift quality ; they are rather examples of building art worthy to have a place beside the ope n-air gymnasiums or palestra of the Greeks. The handsome bounding wall, the j udicious planting of shade trees, the retention of grass wherever possible, tran slate the spirit of organized play to the area itself. [Mumford 1938:42] Mumford also reported: \"The ar chitectural treatment of Ala Mo ana Park and the design of the Mother Waldron playground seem to me par ticularly successful...\" (Mumford 1938:48). 3.1.15 Squattersville Poor people, mainly native Hawaiians, lived in shacks and sturdy hou ses in the 1920s on lands reclaimed during the construction of Fort Armstrong and areas to the east. The area was called \"Squattersville,\" named because the people were living on government land without authorization (Figure 30). This camp in the Ka' kaukukui area (shortened to ' kaukukui), was generally located around Olomehani Street near the shoreline, protected from the waves by a long sea wall. There were around 700 Hawaiians and part-Hawaiia ns living in shoreward camps in the mid-1920s, but by 1926 they were all gone. The government evicted the families and razed the houses (Clark 1977:64). Clark further reports on the developments in th e area after the demise of Squattersville: During the 1930's and 1940's, the Ka' kaukukui area conti nued to be heavily utilized as a fishing a nd swimming area, especially by children from the neighboring community of Kaka'ako. The children surfed on redwood planks in the break they called \"Stone wall.\" Many varieties of fi sh were abundant. Younger divers were warned by the old-time re sidents to stay away from the large sharkhole on the Waik k side of Kewalo Channel. Many people came to this area to pick limu [seaweed] and wana [sea urchin], and also to catch squid on the shallow reef.

Wall (Hawai'i Territory Survey Plat Map 2050) Cultural Surveys Hawai' i Job Code: KAKAAKO 13 Background Research Archaeological Assessment, Place Honolulu, O'ahu 57 TMK [1] 2-1-051:009 3.1.16 Early Twentieth Century Land Reclamation Projects 3.1.16.1 Kaka'ako Reclamation The first efforts to deepen Honolulu Harbor were made in the 1840s. The idea to use the dredged material, composed of sand and crushed coral, to fill in low-lying lands, was quickly adopted. From 1857 to 1870, the \"Esplanade\" between Fort and Alakea stre ets was created on 22 acres of filled-in former reef and tideland. By 1874, Sand (Quarantine) Is land, site of the first immigration station, had been crea ted over \"reclaimed\" land on reefs. By the 1880s, infilling of the mud flats, marshes, salt ponds in the Kaka'ako area had begun. This infilling was driven by three separate, but overlapping, improvement justifications. The first directive was for the construction of new roads and improving older roads by raising the grade so the improvements would not be washed away by flooding during heavy ra ins. A report by the Hawaii Board of Health (1908:80) noted: I beg to call attention to the built-up section of Kewalo, \"Kaka'ako,\" where extensive street improvements, filling and grading have been done. This, no doubt, is greatly appreciated and desirable to the propert y owners of that locality, but from a sanitary point of view is da ngerous, inasmuch as no provision has been made to drain the improved section, on which have been erected neat cottages occupied for the greater part by Hawa iian and Portuguese families, now being from one to three feet below the street surface, and which will be entirely flooded during the rainy season. Unless this is reme died this locality w ill be susceptible to an outbreak [of cholera] such as we experienced in the past. As mentioned in the above sec tion, the justification for inf illing of low-lying areas most frequently cited was public health and sanitation: the desire to clean up rivers and ponds that were reservoirs for diseases such as cholera and acted as breeding places for rats and mosquitoes. Thus, as early as 1902 (Hawaii Board of Health 1902:80), it is reported that: The Board has paid a great deal of a ttention to low-lyi ng stagnant ponds in different parts of the city, and ha s condemned a number of them. The Superintendent of Public Works has give n great assistance to seeing that the ponds condemned by the Board are filled. In September a pond on South Street was condemned as deleterious to the public health. The first areas to be filled were those areas closest to Honolulu, th en moving outwards to Kaka'ako (Griffin et al. 1987:13). Th e first fill material may have been set down in 1881 for the Kaka'ako Leper Branch Hospital, which had been built on a salt marsh. La borers were hired to \"haul in wagonloads of rubble and earth to fill up that end of the marsh\" (Hanley and Bushnell 1980:113). In 1903, five more lots in Kewalo, on Ilaniwai, Queen, and Cooke streets, were condemned and ordered to be filled (Hawaii Board of Health 1903:6). Although public health and safety were prominen tly cited, according to Nakamura (1979), the main desire (and third jus tification) to infill Honol ulu, Kewalo, and then Waik k lands was to provide more room for residential subdivisions, industrial areas, and finally tourist resorts. In the early part of the twentieth century, Kaka'ako was becoming a prime spot for large industrial complexes, such as iron works, lumber yards, and draying companies, which needed large spaces Cultural Surveys Hawai' i Job Code: KAKAAKO 13 Background Research Archaeological Assessment, Place Project, Kaka'ako, Honolulu, O'ahu 58 TMK [1] 2-1-051:009 por. for their stables, feed lots, and wagon sh eds. In 1900 (Thrum 1901:172), the Honolulu Iron Works, which produced most of the large equipment for the Hawaiian plantation sugar mills, moved from their old location at Queen and Merc hant Street near downtown Honolulu to the shore at Kaka'ako, on land that had been filled from dredged material during the deepening of Honolulu Harbor. Other businesses s oon followed. Thrum (1902:168) noted: The Union Feed Co. is another concern whose business has outgrown the limits of its old location, corner of Queen and Ed inburgh streets. Like the Iron Works Co. they have secured spacious premises at Kakaako, erecting buildings specially adapted to the needs of their extensiv e business at the corner of Ala Moana (Ocean Road) and South Street. Private enterprises were not the only new occu pants of Kaka'ako. A sewer pumping station, an immigrant station, and a garbage incinera tor were also built on \"reclaimed land.\" Thrum (1907:148-149) noted: The dredging of Honolulu harbor and its ch annel is completed as far as planed for the present...the material there from being used to fill in a large area of Kakaako and the flats in the vicinity of the sewe r pumping station and garbage crematory. For the incinerator, Thrum noted: The new station is built on p iles on reclaimed land that is being filled in from the coral dredgings that is going on, and is gradually taking on a tropical appearance. ....Adjoining its premises on the mauka side is the new building designed for the Planters's Association for their labor bureau. The new immigration station (Figure 31) had seven large rooms for dormitories, surrounded by a breezy, open lanai , where immigrant workers would stay while waiting for their clearance to go to their new work places on the sugar planta tions. Adjacent to the dormitory was a hospital, which was used to check the new immigrants for any \"loathsome or dangerous contagious disease\" (Hawaii Governor 1905:77 ). The hospital was also used during epidemics to isolate contagious patients, suffering from such di seases as smallpox, c holera, or plague. In 1900, a pond surrounded by a bicycle racing trac k, called the Cyclomere (built in 1897), in the Kewalo area was filled. This was located on the makai side of Kapi'olani Avenue between Cooke Street and Ward Avenue. In 1904, the ar ea around South Street from King to Queen Streets was filled in. The Hawaii Department of Public Works (1904) reported \"considerable filling [was] required\" for the extension of Queen Street, from South Street to Ward Avenue, which would \"greatly relie ve the district of Kewa lo in the wet season.\" 3.1.16.2 Kewalo Reclamation Project Although the Board of Health co uld condemn a property and the Department of Public Works could then fill in the land, the process was rather arbitrary a nd piecemeal. In 1910, after an epidemic of bubonic plague, the Board of Hea lth condemned a large section of Kewalo (including areas in Ka' kaukukui), consisting of 140 land pa rcels which had numerous ponds (Hawaii Department of Public Works 1914:196). Cultural Surveys Hawai' i Job Code: KAKAAKO 13 Background Research Archaeological Assessment, Place Project, Kaka'ako, Honolulu, O'ahu 59 TMK [1] 2-1-051:009 Figure 31. (circa 1900) of the Immigra tion Station at Kaka'ako, Union Feed Co. stables in center background (Hawai'i State Archives) In 1914, the entire: ...locality bounded by King street, Ward avenue, Ala Moana and South street, comprising a total area of about two hundr ed acres, had been found by the board of health of the Territory to be deleteri ous to the public health in consequence of being low and below 'the esta blished grades of the street nearest thereto' and at times covered or partly covered by wa ter and improperly dr ained and incapable by reasonable expenditure of effectual drai nage, and that said lands were in an insanitary and dangerous conditi on. [Hawaii Supreme Court 1915:329] The superintendent then sent a le tter to all of the property owners , informing them that they must fill in the lands to the grade of the street level within sixty days. Only a few of the land owners complied, infilling their land with a variety of mate rials. Most of the land owners did not comply with the notice, and in 1912 the bid was given to Lord-Young Engineering Co. to fill in the land with \"sand, coral and material dredged from the harbor or reef and the depositing of the same upon the land by the hydraulic method\" (Hawaii Supreme Court 1915:331). The affected land owners sued to stop the work, and in the suit, the method of hydraulic filling is described: By this [hydraulic] method the material dr edged is carried in suspension or by the influence of water which is forced thr ough large pipes and la id upon the lands and Cultural Surveys Hawai' i Job Code: KAKAAKO 13 Background Research Archaeological Assessment, Place Project, Kaka'ako, Honolulu, O'ahu 60 TMK [1] 2-1-051:009 por. intervening streets, and afterwards is distributed and leveled, the water having drained off through ditches provided for th e purpose. The work is done in large sections around which bulkheads have been constructed. A section can be filled in about thirty days, the dredger working about fifteen hours per day. And in about two months after a section has been fille d the ground will have dried out so as to be fit for use as before...The character of the material varies from very fine sand to coarse bits of coral... It appears in evidence that though the method employed the finest of the material which is carried upon the la nd settles when the water which transports it becomes quiet and as the water runs off a sludge or mud remains which forms a strata more or less impervious to water. This stra ta, however, is covered by the coarser and more porous material...it appears that by mixing in to a depth of a few inches ordinary soil small plants will grow without difficulty...The character of the locality must be considered. It is not adapted to agriculture, but is suited more particularly to such business purposes as it now partly used for, such as stables, laundries, warehouses, mills, etc., and for cottages with small yards for the accommodation of laborers engaged in c onnection therewith. U pon the whole, we are of the opinion that the ma terial proposed to be used in the fill-in of the lands of the complainants is not of a character as should be held to be improper for any of the reasons urged. [Hawaii Supreme Court 1914:351] The first land to be filled-in was the portion of the Ward Estate property west of Ward Avenue, which was completely filled-in by June of 1913. In July, \"25,000 cubic yards of sand and ground-up coral were deposited on the Bishop Estate property in the vicinity of Ala Moana and Keawe street, the reason for shifting operations to this part of the district being that the Hawaiian Sugar Planter's Association had erecte d a reinforced concrete building there and wished to have the lot brought to grade\" (Hawaii Department of Public Works 1914:198). By August, the remaining Ward Estate lands west of Ward Avenue had been completely filled-in. By February 1914, all of the land from South Street to Ward Avenue, and from Ala Moana Boulevard to Queen Street had been filled, including the current project area. The expense of the suit did ma nage to shut down operations pl anned for the ar ea from Ward Avenue to Waik k (Thrum 1916:159-160). This land was ma inly owned by the Bishop Estate, who leased the land to small farmers growing ta ro and rice and raising ducks in the ponds. In 1916, the Bishop Estate announced that as soon as their present tenant leases expired, they planned to fill the lands and divide them into residence and business lots (Larrison 1917:148- 149). In 1919, a portion of the coastal section of the Bishop Estate lands was secured by the government in order to expand th e Kewalo Basin (Thrum 1920:148). 3.1.16.3 Waikk Reclamation Project It was during the 1920s that southeast O'ahu w ould be transformed, when the construction of the Ala Wai Drainage Canal - begun in 1921 and completed eight years later - resulted in the draining and infilling of the remaining ponds a nd irrigated fields of Honolulu and Waik k. The canal was one element of a plan, firs t conceived in 19 06, to urbanize Waik k and the surrounding districts. The final result was a \"canal three miles long, with an average depth of Cultural Surveys Hawai' i Job Code: KAKAAKO 13 Background Research Archaeological Assessment, Place Honolulu, O'ahu 61 TMK [1] 2-1-051:009 por. twenty-five feet and a breadth of two hundred fifty feet\" ( Honolulu Advertiser , 17 October 1928:2:16). Several claims were made against the dr edging company, including compensation for destroyed crops and livestock by farmers. For in stance, a Chinese tenant farmer named Chang Fow, leasing lands in Waik k from the Bishop Trust Compa ny, wrote a letter of complaint indicating that the salt water that leached into hi s lands as a result of the dredging of the canal had devastated his fishponds and stocks of ducks and chickens (letter from Chang Fow to the Bishop Trust Company, 23 May 1922, cited in Nakamura 1979:100-101). His claims, along with those of other residents of the area, give an im pression of the continuing agricultural subsistence base in Waik k that lasted into the 1920s. Information about the actual dred ging and infilling process, a nd the materials dredged-up and used for fill, is minimal. Statements and pict ures regarding the event show that dredging was done both off-shore, on the ocean bed, and in the area slated for the canal. Information regarding the filling process of personal pr operties is unclear. Numerous phase s seem to have taken place. Nakamura (1979:85) writes that the government of the Territory of Hawai' i solicited bids, in 1920, for the dredge and fill project planned for the environs of Waik k. The plan was to create hundreds of acres of urban land, at the expense of wetland agriculture and aquaculture in the area. The advertisement, soliciting bids for the project put forward by Lyman H. Bigelow, masked the significance of the project by stating th at \"for Dredging a Drai nage Canal and Filling and Reclaiming Certain Unsanitary Lands at Wa ikiki\" (Nakamura 1979:85). He further writes that State laws were passed requiring property ow ners to pay for the infilling of their lands, which apparently was going to be done whether th ey wanted it or not. A lien would be fixed against their property, and if payment was not made on time, land would be foreclosed on. Nakamura points out that the cost was so high fo r some of the property owners that the bank lien could extend into a fifteen-ye ar mortgage (Nakamura 1979:89). Once land that the Terr itory of Hawai'i government wanted filled in (e x. for government buildings) was complete, any further dredged materials became the property of the dredging company (i.e. the Hawaiian Dredging Company) a nd they could then sell the materials to the property owners, who in-turn were forced to buy the product. Walter F Dillingham, of the Hawaiian Dredging Company, died in 1963. Time magazine, in their article about him and his involvement in the project stated that \"...Walte r Dillingham used the muck dragged up from the sea to fill in low, marshy areas around Honol ulu, over the years crea ted 5,000 acres of solid ground that now holds a full third of the city's population\" (cited in Nakamura 1979:112). The land surface of mode rn Honolulu and Waik k is situated on the result of this decade long dredging and infilling project, of which the creation of the Ala Wai Canal was included. In Nakamura's (1979:113) The Story of Waik k and the Reclamation Project , he writes that this land \"reclamation\" program changed the ecology of Waik k from a once viable and important agriculture and aquaculture center, under the subterfuge of \"drainage\" and \"sanitation.\" Many of the original property owners lost their land or had serious damage to their property as a result of the reclamation activities and/or the costly expense for the manda tory infilling of their properties. Cultural Surveys Hawai' i Job Code: KAKAAKO 13 Background Research Archaeological Assessment, Place Honolulu, O'ahu 62 TMK [1] 3.1.17 Urban Expansion in the Kaka'ako Area Kaka'ako was considered outside the Honolulu town boundary and was used in the mid to late nineteenth century as a place for cemeteries, bur ial grounds, and for the quarantine of contagious patients. Then, in the beginning of the twentieth century, the area was used as a place for sewage treatment and garbage burning, finally becomi ng an area for cheap housing and commercial industries (Griffin et al. 1987:13). Late nineteenth century maps (see Figure 7 an d Figure 8) show the emerging traces of the future development in Kaka'ako as the grid of roads extending southeast from Honolulu toward Waikiki. Queen Street, which was planned to connect to the beach road near Waik k, appears to follow the route of the traditional trail from Kou (Honolulu) to Waik k, as described by John Papa 'I'i. As previously discussed, this tra il likely traversed a sand berm raised above the surrounding marshlands and coral flat s. The late nineteenth century maps indicate the vicinity of the current project area remain ed marshland with fishponds a nd salt ponds. At this time, the project area was a portion of the Kaka'ako Salt Works (see Figure 17), which probably ceased its operation sometime before 1916. A series of U. S. Geological Survey (or wartime U.S. Army) topographic maps shows the gradual expansion of the Honolulu urban district to the edge of Kaka'ako and beyond in the early twentieth century. During the first half of the tw entieth century, both rice fields and marshlands were eliminated as Kaka'ako lands were fille d to accommodate the expanding urbanization of Honolulu. As previously discussed, the current project ar ea and vicinity were co mpletely filled by 1914, during road improvement projects and the Kaka'ako/Kewalo Recl amation projects. All of the ponds and the low-lying areas in the vicinity of the current pr oject area were filled, and new land, including the vicinity of Fort Armstrong, was created from dredged material. The 1919 War Department map (Figure 32), shows the extent of land reclamation and development in the Kaka'ako area. The map indicates that early twentie th century residences in the vicinity of the project area were clustered be tween Pohukaina and Queen Street s, with several structures indicated within the current project area. The Pohukaina School build ing is also shown immediately makai of the current project area. The current project area appears to be near the edge of the expanding urban area at this time. Streets extending toward Waik k are shown as dashed lines, indicating the roads were not yet paved. The 1927-28 U.S.G.S. map (Figure 33) shows the continued expansion of the urban Honolulu area into the formerly open areas of Kaka'ako. Ma terial dredged during construction of the Ala Wai Canal, Kewalo Basin, and othe r near-shore dredging projects, as well as material generated by the city garbage incinerator, continued to be used to fill low-lying and shoreline areas. The 1943 War Department map (Figure 34), shows areas makai (seaward) of Ala Moana Boulevard which were formerly ocean, including Kaka'ako Makai, Kewalo Basin, and Ala Moana Beach Park, as dry land with increasing development. Th e vicinity of the current project area is also shown as an increasingly urban area, primarily consisting of small residential and commercial structures. With increased urbanization of th e Kaka'ako area, these small buildings were replaced by large commercial and industrial structures, as shown in a 1978 aerial photograph (Figure 35).

The current project area is not shown on any of the Dakin Fire Insurance maps for 1891, 1899, or 1906, suggesting that there were no permanen t structures in the ar ea during those years. The current project area and vici nity is first indicated on th e 1914 Sanborn Fire Insurance map (Figure 36). The 1914 map shows the project area within the mauka (northeastern) portion of the city block bounded by Keawe Street, 2nd Street (i.e. Pohukaina Str eet), Coral Street, and an unnamed lane (i.e. future Halekauwila Street). The block is dominated by the \"Pohukaina Public School,\" which occupies much of the makai (southwestern) portion of the block. The mauka portion of the block, contains sm all residential \"dwellings,\" portions of which are located within the current project area. The 1927 Sanborn map (F igure 37) continues to show the \"Pohukaina Public School\" dominating the block. The school has greatly expanded since 1914, with several classroom buildings surrounding the central school building. Several classrooms, an automobile garage, and water closet (i.e. restroom) are located within the current project area. The mauka portion of the block continues to be used fo r residential \"dwellings.\" By 1950, the \"Pohukaina Public School\" has expanded to cover the entire block, including the current project area (Figure 38). Several classroom buildings, an automobile garage, and a portion of the school cafeteria building are located with in the current project area. The 1956 Sanborn map (Figure 39) continues to show the \"Pohukaina Public School\" in th e same configuratio n as the 1950 map. As previously discussed, the Pohukaina School was closed in 1980 and the school buildings were subsequently demolished in 1981. 3.2 Previous Archaeological Research 3.2.1 Archaeological Background Most traditional Hawaiian surface structures in Honolulu had been demolished by the time of the first scientific archaeological surveys. In his report on the survey of O'ahu archaeological sites conducted in the early 1930s, McAllist er (1933:80) says of Honolulu: \"Information regarding former sites within the present limits of Honolulu must come entirely from literary sources.\" He does mention P kk Heiau, once the main royal temple in Honolulu, formerly located near the makai (seaward) end of Fort St reet. McAllister does not list Pu'ukea Heiau or Ka'ahaimauli (discussed in Section 3.1.4), but he does note that Peter Corney, a visitor to the island in 1819, saw several heiau (morai ) along the Honolulu shore: There are several morais, or churches in the village, and at new moon the priests, chiefs and hikanees (aikane) [counselo rs] enter them with offerings of hogs, plantains, and cocoanuts, which they se t before the wooden images. The place is fenced in, and have pieces of white fl ags flying on the fences. [Corney 1896:101] The Kaka'ako district of Honolulu became a fo cus of archaeological work during the 1980s, impelled by the construction of local and federa l government buildings and by the state-planned redevelopment of the area. Recen t archaeological investigations have been conducted in parcels in the vicinity of the current project area and w ithin road alignments near and adjacent to the project area (Figure 40). Pr evious archaeological studies in the vi cinity of the current project area are listed in Table 2, with the relevant findi ngs of these investigations summarized below.

Cultural Surveys Hawai' i Job Code: KAKAAKO 13 Background Research Archaeological Assessment, Place O'ahu Community Develo pment District was first de signated as an area bounded by Punchbowl Street to the west, Ala Moana Boulevar d to the south, King Street to the north, and Pi'ikoi Street to the east. This development area is larger than the ancient Kaka'ako, and extends into lands once known as Ka' kaukukui, Kukulu e'o, and Kewalo. In 1987, a report entitled, Kaka'ako: Prediction of Sub-surface Archaeological Resources, Detailing Archival Research and Archaeologica l Assessment of the Kaka'ako Community Development District (Griffin et al. 1987) provided backgr ound information and summarized the historical import of the area: Kaka'ako - the Kaka'ako Community Devel opment District - is not the center of life in greater Honolulu that is, or was, either Waikiki or 'downtown' ewa of Punchbowl. It is, however, relatively rich in the remains of nineteenth century Honolulu, of prehistoric Ha waiian life, and of the et hnic influx from the late 1800's until 1940. Without doubt the single mo st striking archaeological deposit, and the one to which we assign the hi ghest priority, is the 1853 Honuakaha Cemetery fronted by South Street and bisected by Quinn Lane. More than 1000 human burials are reportedly therein... Burials will be found throughout Kaka'ako. Some will be in sand remnants, others intruding into the pumice deposited from ancient Punchbowl eruptions. Most will be prehistoric or early hist oric. We expect that, as in the case of the Ka'akaukukui Cemetery, deaths from pre-1853 epidem ics resulted in many burials throughout Kaka'ako. The chance of high status buria ls, from residences in adjacent elite locations, is high. [Griffin et al. 1987: 73] The Kaka'ako Development area was originally s ubdivided into seven imp rovement districts, which have now expanded into 12 improvement di stricts. These improvement districts consist mainly of adjacent road alignments, as the early work was conducted on roads and utilities. The titles of early archaeological proj ect reports also followed this nom enclature. However, in recent years, development projects have taken place or are planned in many separate parcels. Many of the development parcels overlap with others or w ith road alignments. For ease of discussion, the projects will be discussed by gene ral location, from the northwester n corner of the Kaka'ako area at Punchbowl and King Street, and east to Ward Avenue. 3.2.3 Punchbowl to South Street 3.2.3.1 King Street Rehabilitation Project Between August 2001 and June 200 2, Cultural Surveys Hawai'i (CSH) monitored trenching for the King Street Rehabilitation Project on se ctions of King Street between Dillingham Blvd. and South Street (Mann and Hammatt 2002). Duri ng the course of arch aeological monitoring, one human burial, State Invent ory of Historic Properties (S IHP) # 50-80-14-6371 was recovered near the intersection of South King Street and Punchbowl Stre et, within the present road alignment. The burial was a single adult indivi dual between the age of 15 and 21 years. The close proximity of several existing utility lines a nd the incomplete nature of the skeletal remains Cultural Surveys Hawai' i Job Code: KAKAAKO 13 Background Research Archaeological Assessment, Place Project, Kaka'ako, Honolulu, O'ahu 77 TMK [1] 2-1-051:009 por. indicated that the burial was dist urbed by earlier construction activities. Several historic artifacts, including a porcelain button and a blue glass marble, were recove red in the same stratum, but their association with the burial could not be determined. Up to the nineteenth century, this area would have been within the Honuakaha Village, an early Hawaiian settlement. 3.2.3.2 Kawaiaha'o Church Ground s and the Mission House Kawaiaha'o Church was built in 1842, adjacent to the mission station, where the first foreign missionaries made their home upon arriving in Hawai'i. Th e church, the church grounds containing two cemeteries, and the mission houses have been designated SIHP # 50-80-14-9991. Between 1986 and 1987, students from Chaminad e University (Bordner 1990) excavated eight test units and trenches on the Kawaiaha'o Church grounds. Fo ur test pits (TP 1-4) were placed around the old adobe schoolhouse, which was originally built in 1836. Test pit 1 revealed an old road surface at 6-14 cmbs cm below su rface); this roadbed proba bly dates to c. 1860- 1900. Test Pits 3 and 4 were placed near a series of concrete footings in the ground. This is the site of a structure that was on the ground in the 1950s, possibly moved from an earlier location on the corner of King and Kawaiaha'o Streets, at the northeast corner of the church lot. Surprisingly, no historic debris was found in this area. Test pits near several crypts revealed a sophisticated construction covered by a layer of pa inted plaster. Several hi storic artifacts were recovered in this area in the top layer of soil. F our test units were also placed at the northeast corner of the church lot (TP 5-8), where a 1900 photograph shows a building was once located, possibly the same one that was later moved clos e to the schoolhouse. No evidence for the house structure or any historic debris was found in these units; however, the test units excavated were very shallow. In 1968 to 1970 (Pearson 1980; 1995), excavations were carri ed out at the Hawaiian Mission property east (Diamond Head) of Kawaiaha'o C hurch. Excavations were conducted adjacent to the Bingham house. No human burials were found, although the early missionary Mrs. Loomis mentions in her diary (archived at the Missi on Houses Museum, Honolulu) that a Hawaiian burial was found during the excavation of the fr amed house cellar in 1821. Excavations were also made adjacent to a bedroom unit. No bur ials were found, though a pre-contact burial was reportedly found during the original constructi on of this building in 1841 (Pearson 1995:28). Bottles found in the trenches, units, and wells da te the trash to late eighteenth and early nineteenth centuries. In 1993 (Pfeffer et al. 1993), 116 burial sets were disinterred from below the pavement of Queen Street, which is adjacent to the southern boundary of Kawaiaha'o Cemetery. This section of the cemetery was designated SIHP # 50-80-14-4534. In 2006, CSH (Tulchin and Hammatt 2006) excava ted two 18-meter long trenches in a 0.2- acre portion of the Kawaiaha'o Cemetery adjacent to the makai side of Queen Street. The intent of the subsurface investigations was to locate co ffin/burial pit outlines without directly disturbing human remains in an area for a proposed parking lot. Thirteen coffin burials were noted in one trench and 11 coffin burials were noted in the second trench. The burials were left in place. Cultural Surveys Hawai' i Job Code: KAKAAKO 13 Background Research Archaeological Assessment, Place O'ahu 78 TMK [1] 2-1-051:009 por. 3.2.3.3 Honuakaha Smallpox Cemetery The proposed area for the Honuakaha Affordable Housing Project is a parcel bound by Queen Street on the north, Quinn Lane to the south, and the Kaka'ako Fire Station to the west (adjacent to South Street). In the ninete enth century, this parcel was w ithin the Honuakaha Village, an early Hawaiian settlement. In the twentieth century, this lot was occupied by the Honolulu Brewing and Malting Co., Ltd., brewers of Primo and Royal brand beers, who constructed their brewing facilities on the lo t in 1900. The facility ceased brewing beer in 1920 due to the onset of prohibition. In 1933, the brewery was reoccupi ed by the American Brewery Co., Ltd., also known as the Royal Brewery (SIHP # 50-80-14-9917) . It ceased operations in 1960, and the main building was put on the Nati onal Register of Historic Places in 1972. An environmental site assessment for the study area was prepared (Miyasaki and Og ata 1993) to provide some background information and to report on the pres ent condition for one building at the brewery site between South Street and Punchbowl. Between April 1986 and August 1988, CSH monitore d construction activitie s in the Kaka'ako ID-1 project area (Pfeffer et al. 1993). This included monitoring along South Street and Quinn Lane. Historic research had shown that Honua kaha Cemetery, created solely for the 1853-1854 smallpox epidemic, was located makai of Queen Street on the west side of South Street. This cemetery is now covered by urban development, including the Old Kaka'ako Fire Station, several buildings, and a portion of the American Brewery lot. The cemetery may contain more than 1000 burials. It appears that the cemetery was not utilized following the epidemic and the burials were left in place. A total of 31 burials were recorded from the Honuakaha Cemetery (SIHP # 50-80-14-3712) during the 1986-1988 monitoring. One of the \"buria ls\" consisted of a wooden coffin with no human remains. Of the remaining 30 individuals , 28 were disinterred. Two burials, which were determined to be outside the project area were left in place. For the 28 disinterments, 18 were determined to be historic, as they were interred in an extended positi on and contained historic artifacts, including in 12 cases, the wooden remains of a coffin. Tw o burials were interpreted as possible pre-contact burials as th ey were interred in a sand laye r and did not have any evidence of a wooden coffin or any histor ic artifacts. The remaining 8 burials were too disturbed to determine date of interment. In March and April of 1993, during sewer li ne excavation by Mouse Construction, three burials were inadvertently discove red at 614 South Street in the central porti on of the lot (TMK 2-1-31:20) on the southwest corner (TMK 2-1-31:20) of South St reet and Quinn Lane. \"It was determined that these burials were situated in the Honuakaha cemetery [SIHP # 50-80-14-3712]\" (Avery and Kennedy 1993a:9). Subsequent monitori ng of the site by Archaeological Consultants of Hawai'i, Inc. (ACH), identified six additi onal burials in the same location (Avery and Kennedy 1993b:Appendix), totaling 9 smallpox cemetery burials in this area. In May through July of 1993, Cultural Surv eys Hawai'i (Hammatt and Pfeffer 1993) conducted an inventory survey of the American Brewery site. The primary goal of testing during the inventory survey was to determine an accurate boundary for the cemetery and to gain an accurate assessment of the number of burials with in the parcel. From historical records and maps, the supposed boundary of the Honuakaha Cemetery (SIHP # 50-80-14-3712) was plotted on the south portion of the American Brewery Co. lot. Twenty-one test trenches were then Cultural Surveys Hawai' i Job Code: KAKAAKO 13 Background Research Archaeological Assessment, Place Project, Kaka'ako, Honolulu, O'ahu 79 TMK [1] 2-1-051:009 por. excavated around this plotted line to determin e the actual boundary of the cemetery. Twenty-nine (29) burial pits were located with a backhoe and with hand shoveling. The burials themselves were not disturbed, and were le ft in place. The study estimated the presence of between 179 and 389 burials within the Brewery/ Honuakaha Housing Project parc el. A secondary goal of the survey was to research subsurface traces of the brewery during the early twentieth century. Three refuse pits associated with th e brewery were also uncovered. The identification of the extent of the cemeter y was the primary factor in determining the boundary limits for the new construction of the Honuakaha Memorial Park and the Honuakaha Affordable Housing Building. Subsurface construc tion grading was to be avoided in order to preserve the burials intact. However, even with architectural modifications, it was impossible to place the proposed building foundations in such a way as to avoid impacting all the burials, while at the same time preserving the structural integrity of the build ing. Therefore prior to construction, it was decided to disinter 7 of the 29 burials (i.e. the 29 bur ial pits identified in 1993; Hammatt and Pfeffer 1993) from the mauka limit of the cemetery (Winieski et al. 1996:7). During the excavation of two of these burials , 2 additional burial pits were discovered, previously disturbed remains were encountered in pit fill, and one cranium was encountered in pit fill, resulting in a total of 11 burial disinterments. Thus, be fore construction, a total of 33 burials were recorded, and 11 had been disinterred. Following the disinterment of the 11 burials, construction activities began. A total of 14 human burials (16 individuals) were found during these construc tion activities, which were monitored by CSH archaeologists between Oc tober 1993 and September 1995 (Winieski et al. 1996). These 14 burials were inadve rtent discoveries: 3 from the middle of Quinn Lane and the remaining 11 from an area along the Quinn Lane fe nce line. Findings were limited to the historic era in age, with buria ls associated with the 1853 Honua kaha smallpox cemetery (SIHP # 50-80- 14-3712), and archaeological material s (bottles, metal, etc.) rangi ng from the 1880s to after the construction of the brewery bu ilding at the turn of the 20th Century. The vast majority of the burials present on the property we re preserved and commemorated as part of an ope n garden area on the property, within a specially constructed cr ypt under the garden. 3.2.3.4 Kaka'ako Improvement District 1 (ID-1) From April 1986 through August 1988, Cultural Surveys Hawai'i (Pfeffer et al. 1993) conducted monitoring, data recove ry, and excavation services w ithin the Hawai'i Community Development Authority's Kaka'ako Improveme nt District 1 (ID-1), which was bounded by Punchbowl Street (west), South St reet (east), King Street (nor th), and Ala Moana Boulevard (south), including extensions east for Kawaiaha'o Lane, Queen Str eet, and Auahi Street. Portions of Pohukaina Street, Quinn Lane, and Reed Lane ar e also within this district. This work was conducted almost exclusively undern eath the streets in Di strict 1 and very little private property was excavated. The stratigraphy generally consisted of an upper layer of asphalt, a layer of fill material for road grades, additional fill layers as sociated with constructio n, a buried A horizon of sand, which often contained artifacts and hu man burials, the underlying Tantalus/Sugarloaf cinder deposited thousands of years before hu man occupation of the Hawaiian Islands, and the coral shelf formed in the last inter-glacial period. Cultural Surveys Hawai' i Job Code: KAKAAKO 13 Background Research Archaeological Assessment, Place Project, Kaka'ako, Honolulu, O'ahu 80 TMK [1] 2-1-051:009 por. Four burial site areas were enc ountered - two cemeteries and two isolated burials - with a total of 149 burial sets. The cemetery on Queen Street (SIHP # 50-80-14-4534) contained 116 burial sets. These burials are associat ed with Kawaiaha'o Cemetery, which was utilized from about 1875 to 1920. The cemetery section is on the southern border of the Kawaiaha'o Church grounds. A total of 31 burials were recorded from the South Street/Quinn Lane Cemetery (SIHP # 50-80-14-3712). These burials are associated with the Honuaka ha Smallpox Cemetery, which was utilized for burial only from 1853 to 1854. Over 1,000 victims of smallpox were interred in the cemetery during the course of the epidemic. It appears that the ceme tery was not utilized following the epidemic and the burials were left in place. The two isol ated burial sites - on Punchbowl Street (SIHP # 50-80-14-4532) and Halekauwila Street (SIHP # 50-80-14-4533) - each contained one set of remains. The burial at Halekauwila Street was within LCA 61, a fishpond awarded to Queen Kapi'olani within the lele of Ka'ala'a. A variety of other arch aeological and historical features were noted, excavated, and recorded during the monitoring process, incl uding historic trash, layers, hist oric cultural features, and fill layers associated with the urbanization of th e Kaka'ako area. No oste ological analysis was conducted on the 116 sets of remains from the Qu een Street area. These were reinterred in a special vault built on the grounds of the present Kawaiaha'o Cemetery. Osteological analysis was conducted on the burial material from the Sout h Street/Quinn Lane area (Pietrusewsky et al. 1989). These remains were later reinterred in a special vault built next to the Honuakaha Affordable Housing Area (Winieski et al. 1996:5-6 ). In 2004, a series of geotechnical borings were monitored on a portion of the site (Perzi nski and Hammatt 2004). There were no findings. 3.2.3.5 South Street Building Complex As noted in Section 3.2.3.3 above, in March and April of 1993, during sewer line excavation by Mouse Construction, three buria ls were inadvertently discovere d at 614 South Street, in the central portion of the lot, near the southwest corner of South Street and Quinn Lane. \"It was determined that these burials were situated in the Honuakaha cemet ery [SIHP # 50-80-14-3712]\" (Avery and Kennedy 1993a:9). Subsequent mon itoring of the site by ACH identified six additional burials in the same location (A very and Kennedy 1993b:Appe ndix), totaling nine smallpox cemetery burials in this area. 3.2.3.6 Kaka'ako Fire Station (Proposed Fire Department Headquarters) The Kaka'ako Fire Station lot is located betw een Queen Street and Quinn Lane, and is bound by South Street on the east and the American Brewery Site to the west. An assessment of this study area was first conducted by CSH in 1994 (Heidel and Hammatt 1994). Background and archival research conduct ed to determine the use of the land area from pre-contact times to the modern area, revealed that the area initially wa s awarded to Hawaiian officials in the nineteenth century, and the lot eventually came under the control of the government. While under government ownership, the property was used for a hospital and cemetery for the smallpox epidemic of 1853-1854. It was subsequently leased to various individuals until it was designated as the site of one of Hawai'i' s original fire statio ns in 1928 (SIHP # 50-80-14-1346; Fire Stations of O'ahu Thematic Group). A new fire station was constructed on the parcel in the 1970s, with the ol d fire station in the southwestern corner of the lot and the new stat ion in the northeast corn er. In 1979, the old fire Cultural Surveys Hawai' i Job Code: KAKAAKO 13 Background Research Archaeological Assessment, Place Project, Kaka'ako, Honolulu, O'ahu 81 TMK [1] 2-1-051:009 por. station was nominated to the Hawai'i and Na tional Register of Historic Places for its architectural and social significance. Plans are to convert this structure into a Fire Department Museum. Burials associated with the Honuakaha Sma llpox Cemetery have been found along Quinn Lane and south of Quinn Lane. Based on back ground research, the cemet ery is understood to partially lie beneath the new street -level parking lot on the southern border of the fire station. Due to the possibility of burials associated with this cemetery, monitoring was conducted in the study area by CSH in February 2001 (Winiesk i and Hammatt 2001) during geotechnical bore sampling. Five 4-inch diameter bores were excavate d, two in the northwest co rner of the lot, and three in the central section of the lot. No cultu ral materials or evidence of human burials were observed during geotechnical sampling, but intact naturally deposited cinder and sand sediments were identified below layers of fill material In 2004, CSH (Perzinski and Hammatt 2004) c onducted a surface and subsurface inventory survey of the lot and excavated 12 backhoe trenches in the area of the proposed Fire Department Headquarters Building at the south east corner of the lot. No buria ls or other cultural remains were found. The archaeologists concluded, based on th e absence of remains in the test trenches, that the mauka , northern border of the Honua kaha Cemetery was probably to the southeast (south of Quinn Lane) and west (under the parki ng lot surrounding the ol d fire station). Subsequent monitoring for the Kaka'ako Fire Sta tion reconstruction project (Stein et al. 2007) took place between 2004 and 2006. Construction in cluded the building of the new fire department headquarters, trenching for utilitie s along Queen Street, and most importantly, the excavation of 8 boring holes for parking lot lights in the parking lot area at the southwestern side of the lot. This is the area that was thought to possibly have remains from the Honuakaha Cemetery. The stratigraphy observe d during this monitoring project was similar to what had been found during the inventory survey, which was predominately imported fill layers above undisturbed sand deposits with pocke ts of volcanic cinder. No inta ct cultural deposits or human remains were found. However, as the eight boring holes were widely spaced across the parking lot, it is still possible that human remains are present below the Quinn Lane corridor and parking lot of the Fire Department Headquarters and museum. 3.2.3.7 State Office Building In May of 1982, the construction of the new Stat e Judiciary Complex on the southwest corner of Punchbowl and Halekauwila Street was monito red by Science Management Inc. (personal communication from Farley Watanabe, reported in Clark 1987). No pre-contact artifacts or human burials were found, but historic dumps were common features. The study area is within the nineteenth-century Honuakaha Village and overlaps the former yard used for the 1874 Transit of Venus observation station. In 1982, Jason Ota and Wendell Kam (1982) reporte d on six partial sets of human remains recovered during excavation for construction of the State Offi ce Building #2 at the southeast corner of Punchbowl and Halekauwila Streets. The remains were in poor to very poor condition and little could be determined from the osteol ogical analyses perfor med. Two of the burials showed evidence of incisor e vulsion. Tooth evulsion was prac ticed by the late-pre-contact Hawaiian and this may indicate the ethnicity of th ese two burials. All other burials were located Cultural Surveys Hawai' i Job Code: KAKAAKO 13 Background Research Archaeological Assessment, Place Project, Kaka'ako, Honolulu, O'ahu 82 TMK [1] 2-1-051:009 in sand and pre-contact deposits, although some hist oric disturbance may have taken place. This burial area was later desi gnated SIHP # 50-80-14-2963. 3.2.3.8 Makai Parking Garage Between September and November of 1987, th e Bernice P. Bishop Museum monitored construction of a parking garage on the southeast corner of P unchbowl and Halekauwila Streets in the same parcel as the earlier Ota and Kam (1982) study area (Clark 1987). Archaeological features revealed both pre-contact and post-cont act utilization of the s ite. Seven human burials, of which four were complete burials with well -defined burial pit featur es, were unearthed. Two complete burials were in a flexed position, one was a bundle burial, and one was too disturbed to determine burial position. Charcoal from one of the complete burials (F eature 28) was dated to A.D. 1270-1410. Feature 28 also showed post-mort em breakage of the limb bones. Only the femoral heads were still present in the burial pi t; the shafts had been broken off and removed (Clark 1987:75-76). Osteological an alyses of the burials and anal ysis of grave goods indicated that the individuals were of Hawaiian ancest ry, probably from the commoner class rather than the chiefly ( ali'i) class. The burial area was considered part of SIHP # 50-80-14-2963, which was first identified by Ota and Kam (1982). Artifact s recovered at the s ite ranged from basalt tools - including an adze, a hammer stone, and a poi pounder top - and a coral abrader to glass bottles, ceramic fragments, and metal objects. Cl ark concluded that the \"nineteenth century use of the site area included primar ily burying of trash and burial of animals\" (Clark 1987: 114). 3.2.3.9 Judiciary Parking Garage In December of 1985, monitoring was conducted for the proposed Judiciary Parking Garage, at the northwest corner of Pohukaina and South St reets (Athens 1986). In the nineteenth century, this project area would have been in the 'ili of 'Auwaiolimu, south of three fishponds. No undisturbed sand layers were noted in the excavations a nd much of the area appeared to have been disturbed prior to the excavation. It is likel y that the area was under water, or was intertidal in pre-contact times, and therefore, little in th e way of pre-contact Ha waiian deposits would be found. No pre-contact cultural depo sits or artifacts were record ed, but historic artifacts were common in concentrations and scattered thro ughout the several fill layers exposed in the construction trenches. Soda bottles of three O' ahu bottlers were found , including the Sunrise Soda Water Works, Pacific Soda Works, and Arct ic Soda Works. These blob-top bottles date between 1880 and 1915. The deposit was designated SIHP # 50-80-14-3984. In 1988, monitoring for the Federal Judiciary Building parking complex was conducted by the B. P. Bishop Museum (Leidemann 1988). The proj ect area is described as on the northwest corner of Pohukaina and South Streets in the text (Leidemann 1988:1), which would make this project area the same as Athens' 1986 study ar ea. However, on Figure 1 (Leidemann 1988:2), the project area is drawn on th e northwest corner of Reed Lane and South Street, which would make this project area immediately no rth of the Athens' study area. Le idemann makes no mention of the Athens study in her report. Cl ark (1987:22) states th at the project areas are the same. As in the Athens study, no undisturbed sand deposits were r ecorded and no pre-co ntact artifacts were found. Analysis of the artifactual material determined that the most likely time frame for the manufacture and disposal of the historic artifacts found wa s for the years between 1880 and 1930. The deposit was designated SIHP # 50-80-14-1973. Cultural Surveys Hawai' i Job Code: KAKAAKO 13 Background Research Archaeological Assessment, Place Honolulu, O'ahu 83 3.2.3.10 kaukukui Cemetery In 1985, archaeological excavations were conducte d at the former location of the Honolulu Iron Works (Pohukaina, South, Punchbowl, Ala Moan a block). This industrial complex operated from 1853 to 1973, producing much of the sugar plantation infrastructure and mill works, not only for the Hawaiian Islands, but for sugar plan tations around the world. However, by 1982, all of the buildings had been torn down, and as there are no buildings remaining, this complex is not listed on the Hawai'i or National Register of Hi storic Places. Today, th is block is covered by Waterfront Plaza and Restaurant Row, which in cludes seven five-story buildings surrounded by green space. In 1985, five burials were uncovered at th e former Honolulu Ironworks lot (Yent 1985), which is the block at the corner of Punchbowl and Pohukaina Street. The burials were found in burial pits in the sand deposit that underlay a least a meter of the ironworks fill. Two of the individuals were in an extende d position. A crew from the DLNR Division of State Parks (DSP) disinterred the five burials, which were la ter designated SIHP # 50-80-14-2918. Yent's report does not contain a map, so the locations of the burials disinterred by the DSP are unknown. P. Bion Griffin (Griffin et al. 1987:4) states that eight buri als are known from the Honolulu Ironworks area, which he refers to as the Ka' kaukukui Cemetery. Griffin s eems to be the first to call this burial cluster the Ka' kaukukui Cemetery, so this may not be a traditional name. There are no historic documents describing this cemetery. Griffin's di scussion of the Ka' kaukukui Cemetery is confusing and the map (Map 1) on wh ich the burials are plotted is missing from the copy at the CSH library. The report is also not available at the Hawai'i Public Library or the University of Hawai'i Hamilton Library. Altho ugh the SHPD indicates that a copy was once available at their library, it seems to be missing. Griffin (Griffin et al. 1987:71) states that he \"recently\" (sometime between 1985 and 1987) assisted in the retrieval of 'sev eral\" burials from the construction site in an area near Auahi and South streets (Plate 9 in his repor t) and refers to an elevator shaft trench. He does not mention the Division of State Park's 1985 project or explain when the 8 total burials were found or disinterred. Griffin mentions three, or possibly four, additional burial pits in the trench walls that were left in place. There were no coffins a nd only a few grave goods, only one button and a few glass beads. Based on this, Griffi n decided that the graves probabl y dated to the early historic period, \"around 1800.\" He thought the burial cluster might have been a family burial plot, or a place resulting from a single episode of interment, say for an illn ess. Griffin does not give any information on burial position. Two of the burials recorded by Yent were in an extended position. It is possible that this burial cluster dates to a later pe riod than that pr oposed by Griffin; possibly dating to the 1853 smallpox epidemic. There are several possibilities to interpret this incomplete a nd confusing information. Griffin may have aided the DSP crew in 1985; his total of 8 burials consists of the five individuals disinterred and the three individua ls left in place. Thus, all of the burials were found in one cluster near the southeast corner of the property at the junction of Auahi and South streets. The second possibility is that there were two separa te burial concentrations, the five disinterred by the DSP crew in 1985, and the three disinterred by Griffin around 1987. In this case, the location of the first cluster is unknown. Cultural Surveys Hawai' i Job Code: KAKAAKO 13 Background Research Archaeological Assessment, Place Project, Kaka'ako, Honolulu, O'ahu 84 TMK [1] 2-1-051:009 por. Griffin also states that: \"Many more burials are very likely to exist along the extent of the old sand beach. As development proceeds in a Diamond Head direction, human burials and house sites are certain to be found\" (G riffin et al. 1987:4). A preliminar y end of field work report for monitoring at the project was wri tten by a team from Paul H. Rose ndahl, Ph.D., Inc. (Davis et al. 1988). No copy of this report could be found at the CSH library, the SHPD library, the Hamilton Library, or the Hawai'i State Library. 3.2.4 South Street to Cooke Street 3.2.4.1 Queen Emmalani Tower In 1991, monitoring and test excavations (Sch ilz 1991) were recommended for a property bound by Kawaiaha'o Street (north), South Street (west), Queen Street (south), and Emily Street (east) during the construction of the Queen Emmalani Tower. On the 1867 Lyons map, this area is labeled as \"Loko Paki,\" although a pond outline is not shown. This su ggests that the pond had already been filled-in by the last decades of the nineteenth century, probably with dredged material from Honolulu Harbor. A kerosene storage facility was built on a portion of this lot as early as 1876, and was present up to 1884. Another portion of the property wa s used for tenements in the \"Magoon Block,\" which was used for apartments as ear ly as 1884 and was demolished in 1940. After testing for hazardous waste materials at the site was completed, it was recommended that only a literature and archival research for the project area should be conducted. From background research, the authors (Schliz 199 1) concluded that the area was probably a marshland in the early post-contact period. There was no record of a fishpond in the area. The development and construction that began in th e 1880s has probably dist urbed any subsurface historic deposits. During monitoring for the project , a human skull was found in the back dirt pile. Carol Kawachi (1991) from the SHPD went to the site to monitor the decontamin ation of the remaining dirt piles. One additional bone, a humerus, wa s found. The burial remains were designated SIHP # 50-80-14-1604. The human remains were examined by osteologists from the University of Hawai'i (Pietrusewsky and Ikehara 1991). Historic artifacts, related to the residential use of the buildings in the Magoon Block, were al so found in the back dirt piles. In 2005, CSH (Perzinski et al. 2005) conducted an archaeological inventory survey in the same area Schilz (1991) worked on, excavating 13 trenches. Perzinski et al. (2005) discovered two additional human skeletal elements, which were considered part of previously identified SIHP # -1604. Three subsurface features, a garbage p it with many historic artifacts (dating to the decades around the turn of the twentieth century), a wall remnant/concrete slab remnant, and a post hole, were considered reside ntial/industrial remains of the la te nineteenth/twentieth century occupation and use of the block and we re designated SIHP # 50-80-14-6766. CSH (Hazlett et al. 2007) monitored construction at the Queen Emmalani site (now called the Keola La'i Condominium). Hist oric artifacts dating to the decades around the turn of the twentieth century were found in several trench es. Two isolated human skeletal remains in historic fill sediments were disc overed in a utility trench near and parallel to Kawaiaha'o Street. Cultural Surveys Hawai' i Job Code: KAKAAKO 13 Background Research Archaeological Assessment, Place Project, Kaka'ako, Honolulu, O'ahu 85 TMK [1] 2-1-051:009 por. These human were cons idered part of SIHP # 50- 80-14-1604. The scattered human remains are from at least four different individuals. 3.2.4.2 Kaka'ako Improvement District 3 and Pohulani Elderly Housing In November of 1990, during construction of an elderly housing project at the southwest corner of Coral and Queen Streets, human bo nes were uncovered and reported to the State Historic Preservation Di vision (Douglas 1991a). Disinterment of the burials was recommended and CSH then conducted excavations in Nove mber of 1990. Eight separate burials were identified on the east side of the property, with only five removed. A glass bead was found with one burial, suggesting a post-contact date. One bur ial also exhibited a pre-mortem loss of the mandibular incisors, which suggests deliberate tooth evulsion. This procedure was known to have been practiced by Hawaiians in the pre- contact and early post-co ntact period. The author concluded that the burials were probably of Hawaiian ethnicity, perhap s representing a nuclear family. This burial area was la ter designated SIHP # 50-80-14-4380. This project area is within the boundary of LCA 2045 to Kauwahi, who receive d the parcel in the time of Kamehameha I, indicating that this was a Hawaiian habitation ar ea as early as the begi nning of the nineteenth century. In March of 1991, during excavation of a water line trench between Coral and Queen Streets across Mother Waldron Park, human skeletal re mains were discovered a nd disinterred (Douglas 1991b). The remains were determined to be of Hawaiian ancestry, with a pig burial possibly associated with the burial. These burials we re considered part of SIHP # 50-80-14-4380. Douglas (1991c) also conducted background research on the pr operty and structures and Mother Waldron Park, which has been designa ted SIHP # 50-80-14-1388. No subsurface field work was conducted at the park. Between November 1990 and Septembe r 1992, CSH (Winieski and Hammatt 2000) monitored construction at the Kaka'ako Improvement Distri ct 3 area, the Pohulani Elderly Rental Housing project area, and the Kauhale Kaka'ako Project area. Kaka'ako Improvement District 3 was bounded by Kapi'olani and King Streets (north), the northern end of Cooke Street (east), Halekauwila Street (south), and South Street (west). It includes extensions of Keawe and Cooke Streets to the south. The monitoring of su b-surface excavations re vealed that although the area had been previously disturbed to a great extent, a cultural layer and in situ beach sand and volcanic cinder deposits are still intact below fill layers. The cultural layer contained historic artifacts mixed with scant traditional Hawaiian cultural materials. Twenty human burials were discovered during these projects: 9 at the Pohul ani Elderly Rental Housing project (SIHP # 50- 80-14-4380) and 11 in and around Mother Waldr on Park (SIHP # 50-80-14-5820). Five burials were in an extended position, seven were flex ed, and the position of eight could not be determined. One burial was in a coffin and one c ontained a glass trade b ead, suggesting that the burials were of post-contact age. Seventeen of the burials were reco vered and reinterred in Mother Waldron Park. Three were left in pla ce beneath the Pohulani El derly Rental Housing Facility. These scattered burials are all clus tered around the location of LCA 982 to Kukao and the Pu'unui parcel to Queen Emma, an area w ith a cluster of Hawaiian houselots shown on several late nineteenth century maps.

In 1998, an archaeological assessm ent for a 6.8 acre land parcel , which includes the current project area, was written by CSH (Hammatt and Chiogioji 1998). The parcel is bound by Halekauwila Street (north), Pohukaina Street (s outh), Keawe Street (wes t) and Cooke Street (east). The parcel is the site of a municipal parking lot, a st ate government building, Mother Waldron Playground and a lawn area. It is also the former site of the Pohukaina Elementary School. This report focused on res earching the historic land use of the parcel, especially the history of the Pohukaina Elementary School, wh ich began as a girl's school in 1913 and the origin of the Mother Waldron Park, which wa s constructed in 1937. The park area has been designated as SIHP # 50-80-14-1388 , as part of a thematic group of Honolulu City and County Art Deco Parks. A reinterment site for the Hawaiian burials discovered during construction within Kaka'ako ID-3 (Winieski and Hammatt 2000) is already present at the corner of Cooke and Halekauwila Streets, as men tioned above. The SHPD's burial di vision has also designated an interment site at the corner of Cooke and Pohukain a Streets, which \"will be reserved for future interments\" (SHPD memo of July 2, 1992, cited in Hammatt and Chiogioji 1998:29) 3.2.5 Cooke to Ward Avenue 3.2.5.1 King Street Property near the Roman Catholic Church In 1995, Lisa Anderson (1995) cond ucted an archaeological subsurface inventory survey of the King Street Place (later called One Archer Lane ) property. This lot is adjacent to the western side of the Roman Catholic King Street Cemeter y. The western half of the Roman Catholic lot was given to the Catholic Mission in the 1840s, and it was first used as a cemetery in 1851. It continued to be used up to 1928. Eight trenches were excavated on the pr operty. No burials were found, but historic artifacts dating from 1810 to th e early 1900s were co mmon in pit features, indicating that the lot had been used for 19 th century habitation. During the subsequent monitoring of the lot in 1996, one historic burial (designate d SIHP # 50-80-14-5455) was found within a few feet of the cemetery boundary, sugges ting that this area was part of the cemetery. A trash concentration, subsurface post holes, a ba salt mound, and a recent trash pit were also recorded. The historic trash pits were designated SIHP # 50-80-14-5373. In August of 1997, two months after monitoring was halted, a concentr ation of burials was inadvertently found. In all, at le ast 29 individuals were encountered . Analysis showed that \"the burials dated from the mid-1800s to the 1920s\" (Anderson 1997a), sugges ting that the burials were associated with the cemet ery. The burials were regarded as part of SIHP # 50-80-14-5455. Various loose bones recovered may represent an additional individual. In 1997, an exploratory excavation was made for the pr oposed reinterment plot for th e SIHP # 50-80-14-5455 burials at One Archer Lane. Four diagnos tic foot bones were found. The au thor suggests that these bones were missed during the original di sinterment process (Anderson 1997b). In 2006, Cultural Surveys Hawai'i (Perzinski et al. 2006) conducte d an archaeological inventory survey of the Kewalo HECO dispat ch area at 11 Archer Lane. Two burials were identified in this study associated with the previously identified SIHP # 50-80-14-5455 and the Roman Catholic King Street Cemetery. These burials were left in place.

The three lowest (ear liest) strata in the cores were from a marine bay that formed somewhere between 5200 and 2500 B.C. The next stratum contained terrigenous soil, indicating that the area was then solid ground. Between A.D. 300 and 500, a lagoon formed behind a barrier beach; the pollen analysis indicates that this may be the first era of human occupation. The lagoon became a marsh in A.D. 340-600, which stabilized over time. The upper strata were fill layers, deposited to fill in the marches in the late 19 th to early 20th centuries. 3.2.6 Summary of Archaeological Resources A total of 297 burials have been recorded in the Kaka'ako area from Punchbowl Street to Ward Avenue, including 257 from f our historic cemeteries, three additional historic burials, and 37 scattered, possibly pre-contact burials. Based on the archaeological repor ts, it appears that all pre-contact human burials that have been enc ountered in the Kaka'ako area were buried in sandy deposits. The locations of all previously identified historic properties, incl uding burials, near the project area are indicated on Figur e 41. A summary of the burials si tes is presented in Table 3. In several cases, the pre-contact/early post-cont act burials are located around or within former fishpond areas, such as: SIHP # -1604, four buria ls recorded in a area once covered by a pre- 1867 filled fishpond; SIHP # -4553, a single buria l found in an area once covered by a fishpond owned by Queen Kapi'olani; and SIHP # -2963, 13 burials found adjacent to the former north shore of an 'Auwaiolimu 'Ili fis hpond. In the eastern se ction of the Kaka'ako area, at the eastern extension of Queen Street, a nineteenth centu ry cemetery (SIHP # -6658) was found along the lip of a former fishpond called Kolowalu. It is possi ble that the artificial earthen berms around fishponds were considered desirable places for burials. These earthen berms would have been higher than the surrounding easily -flooded coastal areas, and the soil of the built-up berms was probably easier to dig than undisturbed ground. In the Kaka'ako area between Punchbowl Street and Pi'ikoi Street, ther e Ka' 50-80- 14-2918, 8 burials recorded, 5-8 disinterred), possibly utilized from the 1700 s to the early 1800s; the Honuakaha Smallpox Cemetery (SIHP # -3712, 87 burials recorded, 62 di sinterred), used from 1853-1854; a portion of Kawaiaha'o Cemetery (SIHP # -4534, 129 burials recorded, 116 disinterred), used from 1875- 1920, and the King Street Roman Catholic Cemete ry (SIHP # -5455, 33 burials estimated, three disinterred), used from the mid-1800s to the 1920s . The full extent of these cemeteries has not been determined, and there are likely hundreds of burials remaining in these cemeteries, within the modern cemetery boundaries or under modern structures. The burial at SIHP # -4532 is a known historic burial. At leas t 2 of the 9 burials in the Kaka'ako ID-3 area (SIHP # -5280) were historic (one coffin and one with historic grave goods). There is no historic documentation on this small hi storic burial area and its extent and time of use is unknown.

The remaining 37 burials found in the Kaka'ako ar ea west of Ward Avenue, at SIHP #s (4 individuals), -2963 (13), -4380 (9), -5280 (7), and 6371 (1) were not interred in coffins, do not have associated historic grave goods , or consist of partial, previously disturbed, burials. Some burials were found in a flexed position, a traditional Hawaiian burial practice. These may date to the pre-contact period or the early post-contact period (before the mid- nineteenth century), when most Hawaiians a dopted Western style buria l practices (usually extended within a coffin). Most of these burials cannot be assigned to a specific time period. The main early (nineteenth century) historic habitation area in the Kaka'ako area was within Honuakaha Village on both sides of Punchbowl Stre et at the junction with Queen Street. There was a second cluster of houselot s near LCA 982 and the Pu'unui lot to Queen Em ma. No intact early post-contact cultural layers have been record ed in these areas, due to extensive disturbance, but possible pre-contact/early pos t-contact burials are concentrated in these two areas. Also found within the Kaka'ako ar ea west of Ward Avenue were historic deposits/ # -1973, -3984, -6766, -9917, and -9991), whic h usually date around the last decades of the nineteenth to the early decades of the twen tieth century. There are also several historic structures/properties with SIHP numbers, su ch as Kawaiaha'o Church and Mission grounds (SIHP # -9991), the Royal Brewery (SIHP # -9917) , Waldron Park (SIHP # Kaka'ako Fire Station (SIHP # -1346). 3.2.7 Previous Archaeological Work in the Curr ent Project Area and Immediate Vicinity A review of reports currently on file at the State Historic Preservation Division (SHPD) indicates that no comprehensive archaeological st udies of any portion of the current project area have been completed. However, in 1991 and 1992, during excavations for infrastructure improvements associated with the Hawai'i Community Development Agency project in Kaka'ako, eleven human burials were inadverten tly exposed in the immedi ate vicinity of the project area. The improvements included installa tion of a storm drain along Halekauwila Street, and installation of electric lines on Keawe Str eet and at the intersection of Halekauwila and Cooke streets. The fact that six of the burials were flexed (the position of 4 could not be determined and one was in an extended position) and the general absence of historic artifacts suggest that most (or a ll) of the burials were of a pre-contact date. Following consultation with the SHPD, all th e burials were disinterred and curated by Cultural Surveys Hawai'i until th ey were returned to the SHPD in July of 1993. Subsequently, the burials were reinterred a sp ecially-constructed site at the corner of Halekauwila and Cooke streets; the reinterment was coordinated by the burial administ rator of the SHPD. According to a memorandum of July 2, 1993 from the HCDA to the SHPD burial administrator, the reinterment s ite at the corner of Halekauwila and Cooke streets comprised \"site A [to] be utilized for Improvement Dist ricts 1 and 3 burials.\" The memorandum also designates the corner of Cooke and Pohukaina streets, as \"site B [which] will be reserved for future reinterments.\" Cultural Surveys Hawai' i Job Code: KAKAAKO 13 Background Research Archaeological Assessment, Place Project, Kaka'ako, Honolulu, O'ahu 91 TMK [1] 2-1-051:009 por. 3.3 Background Summary and Predictive Model Background research indicates a low intensity of use in the vicinity of the current project area in pre-contact and early post contact times. Adj acent areas to the west were marshy into the 1880s and this may have restricted the early us e and development of Ka ka'ako to areas to the north and east of the current project area. Coral Street, forming the south east side of the project area, was slowly established as a major mauka/makai artery for Kaka'ako in the mid 1880s and 1890s. Kaka'ako grew rapidly in the first decades of the twentieth century. The large Pohukaina School was re-established on a new campus just seaward of the curren t project area in 1913. A variety of \"dwellings\" were present on the mauka side of the projec t area by 1914. By 1927, Pohukaina School had expanded in to the project area and cove red the entire block by 1950. Classroom buildings were aligned along Keawe, Co ral, and Halekauwila streets, arranged around the perimeter of the current projec t area. Structures then present within the present project area included seven classrooms, a caf eteria and a couple of small storage structures. The school continued to dominate the project area until it was demolished in 1980. Since then, the current project area has been used as a public parking lot. The historic record would suggest only remnants of turn of the twen tieth century habitation and school related finds in the time frame of 1913 to 1980. However, the archaeological record suggests a somewhat differe nt picture. The identification of th ree burials near th e intersection of Halekauwila and Keawe streets and 8 burials n ear the intersection of Coral and Halekauwila streets (both addressed in Wini eski and Hammatt 2000), clearly s uggests a pattern of pre-contact human interment in the vicinity.

Section 4 Results of Fieldwork 4.1 Survey Findings The project area is almost entirely asphalt-paved and is currently used as a parking lot (Figure 42). No surface struructures are present within th e project area, with the exception of a modern portable trailer used by the Honolulu Police Department as a substation. 4.2 Test Excavation Findings Subsurface testing consisted of the excavation of 18 test trenches within the project area (Figure 43 and Figure 44). Test trenches were distributed thr oughout the project area to provide representative coverage and assess the stratigraphy and poten tial for subsurface cultural resources. Test trenches generally measured 6 m long and were excavated approximately 2 m deep, terminating at the su rface of the coral shelf. The stratigraphic sequence generally consisted of three to five layers (i.e. Stratum I and Stratum II) of historic and modern fill material beneath the modern asphalt pavement and gravel base course. The natural sediment layers (Strat um III) were generally encountered at depths approximately 0.9-1.3 m below the current land surface, within approximately 0.5-1.0 m of the water table. Stratum I includes historic and modern fill mate rials, subdivided into sub-strata based on differences in soil composition. Stratum I generally consisted of mixed terrigenous fill material in the upper sub-strata, and crushed-coral fill material in the lower sub-strata. Construction debris and abandoned utilities were observed within Stratum I. Excavation features were observed in the upper fill layers of Trenches 1- 3, 8, 9, 11, and 15. The featur es consist mainly of a mix of fill strata with utility and foundation remnants, and are likely related to historic and modern construction/demolition events of the former Pohukaina School. Stratum II includes a layer of ash and burnt garbage, and layers of san dy clay fill material. The layer of burnt garbage and ash is interpreted to be fill material gene rated by the city's munici pal garbage incinerator that was formerly located in the Kaka'ako area. Diagnostic artifacts, consis ting primarily of glass bottles, were analyzed (see Section 5: Results of Laboratory Analysis), dating the layer to the late 1800s and early 1900s. The sand y clay layers are interpreted to be fill material generated by the dredging of Honolulu Harbor and other coastal areas in the vicinity. The dredge material was also used to fill the low-lying marsh areas of Kakaako in the late 1800s and early 1900s (see Section 3.1.16 Early Twentieth Century Land R eclamation Projects). Stratum III includes the natural sandy clay and gleyed clay sediments underlying the historic and modern fill layers. Stratum III generally consisted of a pale brown sandy clay over a gleyed sandy clay. The gleyed sandy clay was located at or near the water table. The Stratum III sediments are typical of a wet, marsh-type environment. No significant cultural mate rial was observed through the subsurface testing program. Detailed stratigraphic profiles and sediment descript ions for each test trench are provided below.

Section 5 Results of Laboratory Analysis 5.1 Artifact Analysis The majority of the artifacts recovered durin g subsurface testing were bottles or bottle fragments typical of the late 1800s and early 1900s. A catalog of all ar tifacts collected is included as Appendix B of this report. Recovere d bottles included those used for soda water, champagne and wine, whisky and brandy, gin, b eer, condiments, perfume, and medicine. Household items recovered includ e crockery shards of plates , bowls, and vases; rice bowl fragments; a tea cup; and a sake glass. Faunal remains were al so observed including long bones of cow, pig, and chicken, as well as a few marine shells. Other items recovered include a leather shoe sole, 2 fragments of a leather belt, and miscellaneous pieces of corroded, unidentifiable metal. Overall, the artifact assemblage is typical of household items of the late 19th and early 20th centuries. 5.1.1 Dating Information for Collected Artifacts The terminology and date ranges used in th e following discussion follow the Intermountain Antiquities Computer System (IMACS 1992) manual, as well as the website on bottle identification and dating maintained by the Bur eau of Land Management and the Society for Historic Archaeology (http://www. sha.org/bottle/index.htm). Bottle dates can be obtained by analyzing manufacturing techniques, and additional dating information can be obtained from embossing on bottles. Embossing can provide info rmation on the glass ma nufacturer, the product distributor, or the brand name of the bottled material. Th e majority of diagnostic bottles were given a date range based on th eir manufacturing technique. 61 historic artifacts recovered from the invent ory survey are diagnosti c glass bottles and bottle fragments from incinerator fill (i.e. Stratum II) a nd associated features in trenches 1, 2, 3, 8, 10, and 15 (Table 4; Figure 63-Figure 73). Of these 61 bottles, over half (37) were used for alcohol. Other diagnostic bottles include 8 soda, 5 medi cine, 5 condiment, 1 personal hygiene, 1 storage vessel, and 5 of unknown function. 11 of the bo ttles have embossing i ndicating manufacturer and, in some cases, type of use. The majority of alcohol bottles recovered were manufactured by turn mold where side seams are erased in the firing process (Figure 66). Th is process was used from the 1870s to the 1920s (IMACS 1992). Of the alcohol bottles recovered where finishes were still intact, 6 of them had finishes that were hand applied; these bottles were likely made slightly earlier (1860s). 6 of the diagnostic alcohol bottles in the assemblage have embossing on their bodies or bases. A complete dark brown bottle is present with \"JOHANN HOFF\" embossed on the shoulder. Johann Hoff malt extract began producti on in 1847 and was marketed as a \"Beer of Health\"; it was introduced to the United States in 1866 (Fike 1987:166). The type of bottle manufacture, turn mold with a tooled lip, indicates it was produced between the 1870s and 1920s (Rock 1981; IMACS 1992).

Two complete and one partial alcohol bottles were recovered with R & CO embossed on the base. This maker's mark indicates the bottles were manufactured by Roth and Company of San Francisco between 1880 and 1890 (Toulouse 1971: 439) . Mold numbers are also present on two of the bottle bases. These bo ttles likely contained beer. A partial brown alcohol bottle was recovered with the maker's mark A B Co/ 9 embossed on its base. The ABC maker's mark represents the American Bottle Company of Chicago, Illinois. The number 9 likely represents the number for the Streator, Illinois plant. This plant was in operation between approximately 1885 and 1930, indicating the bottle was manufactured sometime during this period. The American Bottl ing Company had been formed as a result of mergers of the Ohio Bottling Co., the Streator Bottle and Glass Co., and the Adolphus Busch Glass Manufacturing Co. American Bottling Company eventually merged with Owens-Illinois Glass Co., which is still in bus iness today (Toulouse 1971: 31). The only alcohol bottle of local manufacture presen t in the artifact asse mblage was made by the Honolulu Brewing Company. The bottl e is clear and embossed on the body with HONOLULU BREWING AND MALTING CO.LTD/ HO NOLULU, T.H. It was manufactured by 3 part mold, has a tooled lip and crown top finish, and is embossed with 2833 and the IPG Co diamond (very faint) underneath. The bottl e was produced between 1911 and 1917 (Elliott and Gould 1987: 187). Honolulu Brewing and Malti ng Company began in 1901 and continued to manufacture beer until Prohibition between 1919 and 1933. Production was restarted in 1934 and continued until 1979 (www.lostvirtualtour.com). Three soda bottles were recovered which cont ained local beverages (Figure 67). Of these three bottles, two were manufactured for Holliste r Soda Works. The first is a complete aqua bottle embossed with HOLLIS TER & CO/HONOLULU on the body and has a Hutchinson style stopper still intact; it was manufactured in the 1880s (Elliott and G ould 1988). The second is similar to the first with the same style of em bossing on the body and the same style Hutchinson stopper; the difference is a rounded base whic h indicates it was manu factured in the 1890s. Hollister Soda Works was one of the first soda producers in Hawai'i and, in 1863, was originally known as Hollister and Hyland before breaking o ff to form Hollister Soda Works in 1868. The company expanded to include perfume and t obacco and eventually merged with Tahiti Lemonade Works in 1888 (Sabey 2007: 43). The last soda bottle present in the assemblage was manufactured for the Honolulu Soda Water Company in 1912 (Elliott and Gould 1988:114). The bottle is light green and made by 4 piece mold with applied lip. The body is embo ssed with HONOLULU/ SODA WATER Co. LTD/ T.H./ BOTTLE IS NOT SOLD. A maker's mark of a Maltese cross is present on the base. Honolulu Soda Water Company was founded in 1910 and produced 2 styles of stoppers: the Hutchinson and the BIMAL (Elliott 1971). A medicine bottle with embossed ma ker's mark is also present in the assemblage and consists of an incomplete brown bottle with square Hopkins style base (IMACS 1992). The bottle includes partial shoulders, body, and base (Figure 68 and Figure 69). The base is embossed with REED & CARNRICK/ PHARMACISTS/ N.Y. Reed and Carnrick were manufacturing chemists from 1876 to 1986. In 1899 they relocated from New York to New Jersey, which indicates this bottle was manufactured between 1876 and 1899. The c ontent of the bottle is listed as peptonized cod liver oil and milk (Fike 1987: 1985).

A women's perfume bottle is also present in the assemblage (Figure 70). The bottle is embossed on the body and base with ED PIN AUD and has a Hopkins square base; it was manufactured by ABM. Ed Pinaud began manufact uring perfume in 1810; however the type of manufacture of this bottle i ndicates it was produced after 1904 (Rock 1981; Fike 1987: 67). The other embossed vessel present in the diagnostic glass artifact assemblage is a light green, opaque, round jar embossed on the base with C S & CO/ 1185. This maker's mark identifies Cannington, Shaw and Company Helens , Lancastershire, England. In 1875, Edwin Cannington partnered with John Shaw and opene d a glass factory in St. Helens. In 1913, Cannington Shaw merged with United Glass Bo ttle Manufacturers and the maker's mark was modified. Hence, this vessel dates between 1875 and 1913. Toulouse mentions these vessels are common food containers found in ghost to wns of the west (Toulouse 1971:147-149). In addition to the diagnostic glass bottles, 1 large stoneware bottle is also present in the assemblage (Figure 72). It consists of a mach ine made stoneware bottle with handmade handle and is missing the neck and finish. The make r's mark, BLANKENHEYM & NOLET, is stamped on the shoulder of the vessel. Blankenheym & Nolet were a Ne therlands-based company that exported mineral water and case gin in the late 1800s (Perzinski et al. 2000). One diagnostic ceramic shard is also present in th e assemblage. It is a plate base with a Royal Ironstone maker's mark imprinted (Figure 73). The plate is made of white paste and clear glaze. No decoration was present on the shard. The maker's mark likely represents E. Challinor & Company, which operated in England between 1842 and 1891 ( http://bickler.co.nz .).

Section 6 Summary and Interpretation The current project area is located in Ka' kaukukui 'Ili, within the greater area now known as Kaka'ako. Background research indicat es a low intensity of use in the vicinity of the current project area in pre-contact a nd early post contact times. The area was generally low-lying and marshy. Kaka'ako was considered outside the H onolulu town boundary and was used in the mid to late 1800s as a place for cemeteries, burial grounds, and for the quarantine of contagious patients. From pre-contact times into the early 1900s, the land in Ka' kaukukui was also used to produce salt. Major land reclamation projects of the late 1800s and early 1900s transformed the low-lying marsh lands into dry land fo r the expanding urban Honolulu area. Kaka'ako grew rapidly in the first decades of the twentieth century. Development in the immediate vicinity of the current project area began circa 1913, with th e construction of the Pohukaina School. A variety of residential \"dwelli ngs\" were present within the project area by 1914. By 1927, Pohukaina School had expanded into the project area and covered the entire block by 1950. Classroom buildings were aligned al ong Keawe, Coral, and Halekauwila streets, arranged around the perimeter of the current pr oject area. Pohukaina Sch ool was present within the project area until it was demolished in 19 80. Following the demolition of the school, the project area was paved over and has b een used as a public parking lot. The findings of the current archaeological assess ment study are consistent with expectations based on background research. No surface structur es are present within the project area. Subsurface testing revealed several historic and modern fill layers overlying the natural sediments. The natural sandy clay sediments are t ypical of a wet, marsh- type environment. Fill layers overlying the natural sedime nts included a layer of ash and burnt garbage, interpreted to be fill material generated by the city's municipa l garbage incinerator, and layers of sandy clay, interpreted to be fill material generated by the dredging of Honolulu Harbor and other coastal areas in the vicinity. The presence of the dredge fill material and incinerator fill material is consistent with background research of Kaka'ako land reclamation projects in the late 1800s and early 1900s. The upper terrigenou s fill layers included cons truction debris and abandoned utilities, evidence of the former Pohukaina School. No significant cultural mate rial was encountered through the subsurface tesing program. However, the archaeological record, including the identification of three burials near the intersection of Halekauwila and Keawe streets and 8 burials near the intersection of Coral and Halekauwila streets (both addre ssed in Winieski and Hammatt 2000 clearly suggests a pattern of pre-contact human inte rment in the vicinity. Cultural Surveys Hawai' i Job Code: KAKAAKO 13 Pr oject Effect an d Mitigation Re commendations Archaeological Assessment, Halekauwila Place Project, Kaka'ako, Honolulu, O'ahu 149 TMK [1] 2-1-051:009 por. Section 7 Project Effect and Mitigation Recommendations The following project effect discussion and cult ural resource management recommendations are intended to facilitate project planning and support the project's required hist oric preservation consultation. This discussion is based on the results of this archaeological assessment and CSH's communication with agents for the project propone nts regarding the project 's potential impacts to historic properties. 7.1 Project Effect The proposed Halekauwila Place Project consists of development of a mixed-income urban housing community, including: a 19-story residentia l tower with ground-level retail and meeting spaces; condominium townhomes; and a multi-level parking garage with ground-level retail spaces. Minimally, land disturbing activities w ould include: and grading; excavations for building foundations and subsurface utilities; and associated infrastructure improvements. The proposed project's area of potential effect (A PE) is defined as the entire 1.25-acre project area. No historic properties were identified during the current archaeological assessment study. However, based on background research, including th e previous identification of human skeletal remains in the immediate vicinity of the projec t area, there is potential for encountering human skeletal remains within the natural sandy clay -type sediments underlying fill material in the project area. Due to the potential adverse effect on significant historic properties within the project's APE, specifically inadvertent buria l discoveries, CSH's project-specific effect recommendation is \"effect, with proposed mitigation commitments.\" The recommended mitigation measures will reduce the project's poten tial adverse effect to significant historic properties. 7.2 Mitigation Recommendations To reduce the proposed project's potential adverse effect on signi ficant historic properties, the following mitigation measures are recommended. Th e mitigation measures should be completed prior to any land disturbing activ ities associated with the proposed Halekauwila Place Project. 1. Archaeological monitoring is recommended duri ng all land disturbing activities within the project area. Archaeological monitoring will ensure proper treatment and documentation should any historic propertie s be discovered dur ing project-related construction activities. 2. An archaeological monitoring plan should be prepared for review and approval of the State Historic Preservati on Divison (SHPD) prior to project construction. In accordance with HAR 13-279, the monitoring plan should detail specific archaeological monitoring provisions.

NEAL & ASSOCIATES Applied Meteorology Air Quality Computer Taeyong M. Kim Principal Environmental Communications, Inc. 1188 Bishop Street, Suite 2210 Honolulu, Hawaii 96813 Subject: Halekauwila Place Development Air Quality Impact Assessment Dear Mr. Kim: In response to your request, we have examined the potential air quality impacts related to the proposed development of Halekauwila Place located in the Kakaako District in Honolulu, Oahu. The results of this examination along with background information related to this issue and recommended mitigation measures are summarized below. Project Description Halekauwila Partners, LLC is proposing the Halekauwila Place development in Kakaako on the island of Oahu. The project site includes approximately 1.25 acres of land adjacent to Halekauwila Street that is currently used as a surface parking lot. The proposed development will include the construction of an 18-story residential tower with approximately 204 affordable rental units, a 4-story parking garage, office space for police department staff, approximately 3,000 square feet of retail space, and amenities such as recreational and storage areas. It is expected that the proposed project would be fully developed and occupied by the year 2012. Ambient Air Quality Standards Both federal and state standards have been established to maintain ambient air quality. At the present time, seven parameters are regulated including: particulate matter, sulfur dioxide, hydrogen sulfide, nitrogen dioxide, carbon monoxide, ozone and lead. Hawaii air quality standards are comparable to the national Mr. Taeyong M. Kim November 3, 2009 Halekauwila Place Development Page 2 standards except those for nitrogen dioxide and carbon monoxide which are more stringent than the national standards. Regional and Local Climatology Regional and local climate together with the amount and type of human activity generally dictate the air quality of a given location. Winds are predominantly trade winds which are deviated somewhat from the northeast toward the east or southeast by the local terrain. During winter, occasional storms may generate strong winds from the south (kona winds) for brief periods. When the trade winds or kona winds are weak or absent, landbreeze-seabreeze circulations may develop. Wind speeds are often lower compared to more exposed coastal locations, but the trade winds still provide relatively good ventilation much of the time. Temperatures in the Oahu area leeward of the Koolaus are generally very moderate with average daily temperatures ranging from about 70 \u00b0F to 84 \u00b0F. Extreme temperatures range from about 53\u00b0F to about 95 \u00b0F. Rainfall is relatively low with an average of about 22 inches per year. Existing Air Quality Conditions Air quality in the vicinity of the project presently is mostly affected by emissions from vehicular sources which emit carbon monoxide, nitrogen oxides, hydrocarbons and other air pollutants. Air quality data from the nearest monitoring stations operated by the Hawaii Department of Health suggest that all state and national air quality standards are currently being met in the downtown Honolulu area. Air Quality Impacts of Project Short-term direct and indirect impacts on air quality could potentially occur during project construction. For a project of this nature, there are two potential types of air pollution emissions that could directly result in short-term air quality impacts during project construction: (1) fugitive dust from soil excavation, aggregate processing and vehicle movement; and (2) exhaust emissions from on-site construction equipment. Indirectly, there also could be short-term air quality impacts from the disruption of traffic on nearby roadways, from slow-moving construction equipment traveling to and from the project site, and from a temporary increase in local traffic caused by commuting construction workers. Mr. Taeyong M. Kim November 3, 2009 Halekauwila Place Development Page 3 Fugitive dust emissions from construction activities are difficult to estimate accurately because of their elusive nature of emission and because the potential for dust generation varies greatly depending upon the type of soil at the construction site, the amount and type of dirt-disturbing activity taking place, the moisture content of exposed soil in work areas, and the wind speed. The U.S. EPA has provided a rough estimate for uncontrolled fugitive dust emissions from construction activity of 1.2 tons per acre per month under conditions of \"medium\" activity, moderate soil silt content (30%), and precipita-tion/evaporation (P/E) index of 50. Uncontrolled fugitive dust emissions from project construction would likely be somewhere near this level. In any case, State of Hawaii Air Pollution Control Regulations prohibit visible emissions of fugitive dust from construction activities at the project property line. Thus, an effective dust control plan for the project construction phase should be prepared. Adequate fugitive dust control can usually be accomplished by the establishment of a frequent watering program to keep bare-dirt surfaces in active construction areas from becoming significant sources of dust. On days without rainfall, construction areas should be watered at least twice during the workday to help keep dust to a minimum. Control regulations further stipulate that open-bodied trucks be covered at all times when in motion if they are transporting materials likely to give rise to airborne dust. Haul trucks tracking dirt onto paved streets from unpaved areas are oftentimes a significant source of dust in construction areas. Some means to alleviate this problem, such as tire washing or road cleaning, may be appropriate. Dust monitoring could be considered as a means to quantitatively evaluate the effectiveness of dust control measures. On-site mobile and stationary construction equipment also will emit air pollutants from engine exhausts. The largest of this equipment is usually diesel-powered. Nitrogen oxides emissions from diesel engines can be relatively high compared to gasoline-powered equipment, but the standard for nitrogen dioxide is set on an annual basis and is not likely to be violated by short-term construction equipment emissions. Carbon monoxide emissions from diesel engines, on the other hand, are low and should be rela-tively insignificant compared to vehicular emissions on nearby roadways. Mr. Taeyong M. Kim November 3, 2009 Halekauwila Place Development Page 4 Indirectly, slow-moving construction vehicles on roadways leading to and from the project site could obstruct the normal flow of traffic to such an extent that overall vehicular emissions increase. This impact can be mitigated by moving heavy construction equipment during periods of low traffic volume. Likewise, the schedules of commuting construction workers can be adjusted to avoid peak hours in the project vicinity. After the period of construction, long-term impacts on air quality from motor vehicle exhausts can potentially occur at or near any project that attracts large volumes of motor vehicle traffic. Carbon monoxide emissions are usually the primary issue, and public areas near traffic-congested intersections are the main concern. Primary access to the project will be provided via driveways off Halekauwila Street between Cooke Street and Keawe Street with a secondary driveway providing access to a loading area off Keawe Street between Halekauwila Street and Pohukaina Street. The project traffic study examined six nearby roadway intersections along Halekauwila Street and Pohukaina Street. These included Halekauwila Street at Cooke Street, Halekauwila Street at Coral Steet, Halekauwila Street at Keawe Street, Pohukaina Street at Keawe Street, Pohukaina Street at Coral Street, and Pohukaina Street at Cooke Street. The project traffic study indicates that with the project, peak-hour traffic volumes at these intersections would likely increase by about 5 percent or less except at the intersection of Coral Street and Halekauwila Street where an increase of about 11 to 12 percent would occur (which is a maximum traffic increase of 61 vehicles per hour during the afternoon peak hour). The traffic study also indicates that traffic level-of-service at these intersections is presently good and that by the year 2012, with or without the project, traffic level-of-service conditions would remain essentially unchanged. Based on extensive experience in assessing traffic-related air quality impacts, traffic volume increases of less than about 5 percent or less than about 100 vehicles per hour and traffic approach volumes of less than about 1,000 vehicles per hour do not cause any significant impacts on air quality if adequate traffic level-of-service is provided. The project traffic study indicates that traffic volumes in the project area should remain well within these criteria. Considering the small project-related traffic volumes that are expected, traffic from the proposed project should have no measurable long-term impacts on air pollution levels in the project area. Although a detailed air quality modeling study could be performed to quantitatively Mr. Taeyong M. Kim November 3, 2009 Halekauwila Place Development Page 5 predict project impacts, such an analysis is probably unwarranted. In summary, short-term impacts from fugitive dust during project construction may potentially occur. Because of this, an effective dust control plan for the period of construction should be prepared and implemented. After construction, any long-term impacts on air quality from motor vehicle traffic related to this project will likely be negligible.

SUMMARY The existing and future traffic noise levels in the vicinity of the proposed Halekauwila Place project in Kakaako were evaluated for their potential impacts and their relationship to current FHA/HUD noise standards. The traffic noise level increases along the 6 roadways bordering the project site (see FIGURE 1) were calculated. No significant increases in traffic noise are predicted to occur as a result of project plus non-project traffic following project build-out by CY 2012. Along Halekauwila Street, traffic noise levels are expected to remain at 62 Ldn at 50 foot distance from the centerline in CY 2012. Along Keawe, Cooke, and Pohukaina Streets, traffic noise levels are expected to increase by less than 0.5 Ldn by CY 2012 as a result of project and non-project traffic. Project traffic will add less than 0.4 Ldn additional units of noise along Halekauwila, Keawe, Cooke, and Pohukaina Streets in the immediate vicinity of the project. These levels of traffic noise increases resulting from project generated traffic are not considered to be significant. The predicted increases in traffic noise levels are not expected to generate adverse noise impacts by cY 2012. In spite of these increases, the faces of the garage and residential tower buildings will not be exposed to traffic and/or aircraft noise levels which exceed the 65 Ldn FHA/HUD noise standard. ln addition, the aircraft noise component should not exceed the State Department of Transportation, Airports Division, recommended planning level of 60 Ldn for residences. Mitigation of traffic or aircraft noise levels is not required for the planned units in the residential tower. The Honolulu Fixed Guideway System is planned for construction following completion of the Halekauwila Place project and beyond 2012. Future noise levels from the fixed guideway system are anticipated to be similar to those projected for the existing high rise condominium at 860 Halekauwila Street, and are predicted to exceed the FHA/HUD noise standard of 65 Ldn at the 7th through 14th floors of the future Halekauwila Place units which face Halekauwila Street. lt is anticipated that noise miiigation measures will be applied by the Honolulu Fixed Guideway System project as reo uired. Unavoidable, but temporary, noise impacts may occur during construction of the proposed project, particularly during the excavation and potential pile driving activities on the project site. Because construction activities are predicted to be audible within the project site and at adjoining properties, the quality of the acoustic environment may be degraded to unacceptable levels during periods of construction. Mitigation measures to reduce construction noise to inaudible levels will not be practical in all cases. but the use of quiet equipment is recommended as a standard mitigation measure. Because of the presence of low and mid-rise buildings near the project site and the potential for damage to ihese buildings from vibration during potential pile driving Page 1PROJECT SITE AND LOCATIONS OF SURROUNDING STREETS AND NOISE MEASUREMENTSFIGURE 1operations, vibration monitoring is recommended during close-in pile driving operations where vibration levels are expected to exceed 0.2 inches/second. In addition, it is expected that the design and construction methods for the project building will be optimized to minimize risks of damage to adjacent structures from settling or heaving. A vibration limit of 2.0 inches/second should not be exceeded at any of the adjacent buildings, and modifications to the project's plans prior to design and construction are recommended if these limits are expected to be exceeded. Page 3CHAPTER II. PURPOSE The primary objective of this study was to describe the existing and future traffic noise environment in the environs of the proposed Halekauwila Place in Kakaako on the island of Oahu. Traffic forecasts for 2012 were used. Traffic noise level increases and impacts associated with the proposed development were to be determined within the projeci site as well as along the public roadways which are expected to service ihe project traffic. A specific objective was to determine future traffic noise level increases associated with both project and non-project traffic, and the potential noise impacts associated with these increases. lmpacts from short term construction noise and vibration at the project site were also included as noise study objectives. Specifically, the potential risks of structural damage to adjacent buildings from pile driving operations on the project site were included in the noise and vibration impact assessment. Recommendations for minimizing identified noise and vibration impacts were also to be provided as required. Page 4CHAPTER III, NOISE DESCRIPTORS AND THEIR RELATIONSHIP TO LAND USE COMPATIBILITY The noise descriptor currently used by federal agencies (such as FHfuHUD) to assess environmental noise is the Day-Night Average Sound Level (Ldn or DNL). This descriptor incorporates a 24-hour average of instantaneous A-Weighted Sound Levels as read on a standard Sound Level Meter. By definition, the minimum averaging period for the Ldn descriptor is 24 hours. Additionally, sound levels which occur during the nighttime hours of 10:00 PM to 7:00 AM are increased by 10 decibels (dB) prior to computing the 24-hour average by ihe Ldn descriptor. A more complete list of noise descriptors is provided in APPENDIX B to this report. TABLE 1, derived from Reference 1, presents current federal noise standards and acceptability criteria for residential land uses. Land use compatibility guidelines for various levels of environmental noise as measured by the Ldn descriptor system are shown in FIGURE 2. As a general rule, noise levels of 55 Ldn or less occur in rural areas, or in areas which are removed from high volume roadways. In urbanized areas which are shielded from high volume streets, Ldn levels generally range from 55 to 65 Ldn, and are usually controlled by motor vehicle traffic noise. Residences which front major roadways are generally exposed to levels of 65 Ldn, and as high as 75 Ldn when the roadway is a high speed freeway. In the project area, traffic noise levels associated with Cooke Street are typically greater than 65 Ldn along the Right-of-Way due to the large volume of traffic on that major thoroughfare. For purposes of determining noise acceptability for funding assistance from federal agencies (FHA/HUD and VA), an exterior noise level of 65 Ldn or less is considered acceptable for residences. This standard is applied nationally (Reference 2), including Hawaii. Because of our open-living conditions, the predominant use of naturally ventilated dwellings, and the relatively low exterior-to-interior sound attenuation afforded by these naturally ventilated structures, an exterior noise level of 65 Ldn does not eliminate all risks of noise impacts. Because of these factors, and as recommended in Reference 3, a lower level of 55 Ldn is considered as the \"Unconditionally Acceptable\" (or \"Near-Zero Risk\") level of exterior noise. However, after considering the cost and feasibility of applying the lower level of 55 Ldn, government agencies such as FHA/HUD and VA have selected 65 Ldn as a more appropriate regulatory standard. For commercial, industrial, and other non-noise sensitive land uses, exterior noise levels as high as 75 Ldn are generally considered acceptable. Exceptions to this occur when naturally ventilated office and other commercial establishments are exoosed to exterior levels which exceed 65 Ldn. On the island of Oahu, the State Department of Health (DOH) regulates noise from construction activities, through the issuance of permits for allowing excessive Page 5TABLE 1 EXTERIOR NOISE EXPOSURE CLASSIFICATION (RESIDENTIAL LAND USE) NOISE EXPOSURE DAY-NIGHT EQUIVALENT FEDERAL (1) CI.ASS SOUND LEVEL SOUND LEVEL STANDARD Minimal Not Exceeding Not Exceeding Unconditionally Exposure 55 DNL 55 Leq AccePtable Moderate Above 55 DNL Above 55 Leq Exposure But Not Above But Not Above Acceptable(z) 6s DNL 65 Leq Significant Above 65 DNL Above 65 Leq Normally Exposure But Not Above But Not Above Unacceptable 7s DNL 75 Leq Severe Above 75 DNL Above 75 Leq Unacceptable Exposure Notes: (1) Federal Housing Administration, Veterans Administration, Department of Defense, and Department of Transportation. (2) FHWA uses the leq instead ol the Ldn descriptor. For planning PurPoses' both are equivalent it (a) heavy trucks do not exceed 10 percent of total traffic llow in vehicles per 24 hours, and (b) traffic between 1O:OO PM and 7:oO AM does not exceed 15 percent of average daily traflic tlow in vehicles per 24 hours. The noise mitigation threshold used by FHWA for residences is 67 Leq.

Al- though they are not directly comparable to noise criteria expressed in Ldn, State DOH noise limits for residential, commercial, and industrial lands equate to approximately 55, 60, and 76 Ldn, respectively. It should be noted that the noise compatibility guidelines and relationships to the Ldn noise descriptor may not be applicable to impulsive noise sources such as pile drivers. The use of penaltyfactors (such as adding 10 dBto measured sound levels or the use of C-Weighting filters) have been proposed. However, the relationships between levels of impulsive noise sources and land use compatibility have not been as firmly established as have the relationships for non-impulsive sources. The State DOH limits for impulsive sounds which exceed 120 impulses in any 20 minute period are 10 dB above the limits for non-impulsive sounds. lf impulsive sounds do not exceed 120 impulses in any 20 minute time period, there are no regulatory limits on their sound levels under the State DOH regulations. Page 8CHAPTER IV. GENERAL STUDY METHODOLOGY Existing traffic noise levels were measured at four locations (A, 81, C, and D) in the project environs to provide a basis for developing the project's traffic noise contributions along the roadways which will service the proposed development. The locations of the measurement sites are shown in FIGURE 1. Traffic noise measurements were performed during the months of April and May, 2000. The results of the traffic noise measurements were compared with calculations of existing traffic noise levels to validate the computer model used. The traffic noise measurement results, and their comparisons with computer model predictions of existing traffic noise levels are summarized in TABLE 2. Traffic noise calculations for the existing conditions as well as noise predictions lor 2012 were performed using the Federal Highway Administration (FHWA) Traffic Noise Model (Reference 5). Traffic data entered into the noise prediction model were: roadway and receiver locations; hourly traffic volumes, average vehicle speeds; estimates of traffic mix; and \"Loose Soil\" propagation loss factor. The traffic data and forecasts for the project (Reference 6), plus the spot traffic counts obtained during the noise measurement periods were the primary sources of data inputs to the model. APPENDIX C summarizes the AM and PM peak hour traffic volumes for CY 2009 and 2012, which were used to model existing and future traffic noise along the streets surrounding the project site. For existing and future traffic along the streets surrounding the project site, it was assumed that the average noise levels, or Leq(h), during the PM peak traffic hour were approximately equal to the 24-hour Ldn along those roadways. Traffic noise calculations for both the existing and future conditions in the project environs were developed for ground level and elevated receptors with and without the benefit of shielding from the proposed residential tower building. Traffic noise levels were also calculated for future conditions with and without the proposed project. The forecasted changes in traffic noise levels over existing levels were calculated with and without the project, and noise impact risks evaluated. The relative contributions of non-project and project traffic to the total noise levels were also calculated, and an evaluation of possible traffic noise impacts was made. In addition to the traffic noise measurements, aircraft noise measurements were obtained at Location 82, and nighttime background ambient noise measurements were obtained at Locations 83 and E. The results of these measurements are shown in TABLES 2 and 3. The results of these measurements plus the results of the traffic noise measurements and predictions were used to determine if the proposed housing units are in the acceptable noise zone of 65 Ldn or less. Calculations of average exterior and interior noise levels from construction activities were performed for typical naturally ventilated and air conditioned dwellings. Predicted noise levels were compared with existing background ambient noise levels, Page 9TABLE 2 TRAFFIC AND BACKGROUND NOISE MEASUREMENT RESULTS Time of Day Ave. Speed ----- Hourly Traffic Volume -------- Measured Predicted LOCATION (HRS) (MPH} AUTO M.TRUCK H.TRUCK Leq (dB) Leo (dB) A. 50 FT from the center- 1600 line of Cooke Street.

Potential noise and vibration impacts from pile driving operations were also discussed, and mitigation measures recommended. The potential noise impacts associated with the planned Honolulu Fixed Guideway System were also evaluated in respect to the Halekauwila Place project using the information contained in Reference 7. Reference 7 did not evaluate the potential noise impacts on the Halekauwila Place project, but did evaluate the potential noise impacts on the nearby high rise condominium at 860 Halekauwila Street. Because the Halekauwila Place tower building will be affected in a manner similar to the high rise tower building at 860 Halekauwila Street, the conclusions regarding noise impacts from the Fixed Guideway System at the 860 Halekauwila Street building in Reference 7 were applied to the Halekauwila Place project. Page 13V. EXISTING ACOUSTICAL ENVIRONMENT The existing background ambient noise levels within the project area are controlled by traffiC along Cooke, Pohukaina, Halekauwila, and Keawe Streets; by local traffic within the existing parking lot; and by interisland and military jet aircraft deoartures from Honoluiu International Airport. Traffic, aircraft, and background ambient noise measurements were obtained at six locations (A, B1' 82' 83, C, D, and E) in the project environs. These locations are shown in FIGURE 1. Aircraft noise level measurements were obtained in 2000 and 2009, with the 2009 results shown in TABLE 3. In 2000, the loudest aircraft noise events were typically associated with departures by interisland jet aircraft. Occasionally, departures by the louder military jet aircraft (such as the F-15) were also audible and measurable. Aircraft noise events were typically louder than motor vehicles, and were audible over longer periods than other noise events. Nevertheless, aircraft noise levels at the project site OiO not exceed 60 Ldn in 2000, which is the level above which the Hawaii State Department of Transportation, Airports Division, considers to be unacceptable for residences. By 2009, the 8-737 and DC-9 jet aircraft formerly used for interisland passenger service had been replaced by quieter cRJ 200 and 8-717(200) aircraft, so aircraft noise in the project area have been reduced by at least 3 Ldn units. Because of the modernization of the interisland passenger jet aircraft, aircraft noise is not a major contributor to the noise environment at the project site. The existing traffic noise levels in the project environs along cooke Street are in the ,,Moderate Exposure, Acceptable\" category and less than 65 Ldn within 50 feei of the roadway's cenierline. Along Halekauwila, Pohukaina, and Keawe Streets, existing traffic noise levels are also in the \"Moderate Exposure, Acceptable\" category at 50 feet or greater distance from the roadways' centerlines. The results of the traffic and background ambient noise measurements are summarized in TABLE 2, with measurement locations identified in FIGURE 1. The measurement Sites A through D were located at street level, and Location E was at the third level of the makai/Diamond Head stairs of the 610 Cooke Street building. As shown in TABLE 2, correlation between measured and predicted traffic noise levels was good. The Traffic Noise Model's \"Loose soil\" propagation loss factor was used to obiain the good correlation. The traffic, aircraft, and background ambient noise level measurements at Locations E1,82, and 83 indicated that total noise levels are between 60 to 62 Ldn on the project site in the vicinity of the proposed residential tower. Aircraft noise levels are appioximately 55 to 58 Ldn, while traffic noise levels range from approximately 55 to 62 Ldn at ground level to 59 to 60 Ldn at receptor elevations of 43 feet or more above ground level. Traffic noise levels increase with receptor elevation due to the decrease in noise shielding effects and the reduction of excess ground attenuation effects, Page 14Results of calculations of existing (CY 2009) traffic noise levels at the future residential tower building on the project site are shown in TABLE 4. The results of the calculations are shown for ground level receptors without noise shielding effects from the proposed tower building. As indicated in TABLE 4, the existing noise levels over the project site are higher near Halekauwila Street (along the north side of the project site), and are lower near the south side of the project site. Existing traffic and aircraft noise levels, singly and in combination, do not exceed 65 Ldn, and existing noise levels are considered to be \"Acceptable\" for residences bv FHA/HUD and other federal agencies.

FUTURE NOISE ENVIRONMENT Predictions of future traffic noise levels were made using the traffic volume assignments of Reference 6 for CY 2012 with and without the proposed project. The future projections of project plus non-project traffic noise levels on the roadways which would service the project are shown in TABLE 4 for the PM peak hour of traffic, under the Build Alternative. The corresponding non-project kaffic noise contributions for the No Build Alternative are also shown in the table. Essentially no significant changes in traffic noise levels are expected in the project environs between CY 2009 and 2012, with or without the project. With the construction of the proposed garage and residential tower buildings, traffic noise levels along the east and south faces of the tower building should decrease due to the shielding of the traffic noise contributions from Halekauwila and Keawe Streets. Except for noise shielding effects from the project's tower building, future traffic noise levels should be nearly identical with or without the proposed housing project. The dominant traffic noise source in the project area will continue to be haffic noise from Halekauwila, Cooke, Keawe, and Pohukaina Streets, but the changes in traffic noise levels following project build-out are not expected to be significant. TABLE 4 shows the predicted future traffic noise levels at the four faces of the proposed tower building on the project site following project build-out in CY 2012 for elevated (above the 4th floor) receptors. The beneficial effects of shielding from the proposed high-rise structure, as well as the additive noise contributions from the adjoining streets, are included in the sound level predictions shown in TABLE 4. As indicated in the table, the elevated residential units in the tower building are expected to be exposed to traffic noise levels less than 65 Ldn, and are expected to be in the \"Acceptable\" noise exposure category in respect to the FHA/HUD noise standard for residences. Aircraft noise levels over the project site are not expected to change significantly between CY 2009 and 2012, and should remain at or below the current levels of 55 to 58 Ldn. The future changes in aircraft noise levels over the project site will be more dependent upon the future changes in military jet aircraft operations rather than upon the future changes in civilian jet aircraft operations at Honolulu International Airport. This is because the composite civilian jet aircraft fleet has become quieter in recent times, while the composite military jet aircraft fleet has not. Reference 7 indicates that noise levels from the Honolulu Fixed Guideway System could ranged between 56 to 61 Ldn from ground level to the 6th floor level at the 860 Halekauwila Street and, by analogy, also at the Halekauwila Place project. From the 7th to the 13th floors, rail system noise levels are predicted to range from 65 to 69 Ldn. Above the 13th floor, rail system noise levels decline from 64 to 61 Ldn or less. These noise level predictions assumed that wheel skirts and sound attenuation walls were incorporated into the Honolulu Fixed Guideway System as noise mitigation measures. However, because the sound attenuation walls are not effective at elevated receptor locations above the 6th floor level, both the FHA/HUD and Federal Transit Page 17Administration noise impact criteria will probably be exceeded along portions of the north, west, and east tower faces of the Halekauwila Place project. Page'18CHAPTER VII. DISCUSSION OF PROJECT.RELATED NOISE AND VIBRATION IMPACTS AND POSSIBLE MITIGATION MEASURES Traffic Noise. For the residential units in the proposed residential tower building, traffic noise mitigation measures should not be required for traffic noise projected through CY 2012. Noise impacis from project related traffic along the surrounding roadways which are expected to service the project are not expected due to the very low levels of traffic noise associated with project traffic. General Construction Noise. Audible construction noise will probably be unavoidable during the entire project construction period. The total time period for construction is unknown, but it is anticipated that the actual work will be moving from one location on the project site to another during that period. Actual length of exposure to construction noise at any receptor location will probably be less than the total construction period for the entire project. FIGURE 3 depicts the range of noise levels of various types of construction equipment when measured at 50 FT distance from the equipment. Typical levels of exterior noise from construction activity (excluding pile driving activity) at various distances from the job site are shown in FIGURE 4. The impulsive noise levels of impact pile drivers are approximately 15 dB higher than the levels shown in FIGURE 4, while the intermittent noise levels of vibratory pile drivers are at the upper end of the noise level ranges depicted in the figure. FIGURE 4 is useful for predicting exterior noise levels at short distances (within 100 FT) from the work when visual line of sight exists between the construction equipment and the receptor. Direct line-of-sight distances from the construction equipment to existing residential and commercial buildings will range from 70 FT to 4S0 FT, with corresponding average noise levels of 83 to 65 dBA (plus or minus 5 dBA). For receptors along a cross-street, the construction noise level vs. distance curve of FIGURE 4 should be reduced by approximately 8 dBA when the work is occurring at the intersection with the cross street, and should be reduced by 15 dBA when work is occurring at least 100 FT from the intersection (and the visual line-of-sight is blocked by intervening buildings). Typical levels of construction noise inside naturally ventilated and air conditioned structures are approximately 10 and 20 dB less, respectively, than the levels shown in FIGURE 4. The business offices, produce business, and elderly housing facility across Halekauwila Street are predicted to experience the highest noise levels during construction activities due to their close proximity to the construction site. Aoverse impacts from consiruction noise are not expected to be in the ',public health and welfare\" category due to the temporary nature of the work, the business/commercial character of the neighborhood, and due to the administrative controls available for regulation of construction noise. Instead, these impacts will probably be limited to the temporary degradation of the quality of the acoustic environment in the immediate vicinity of the project site.

The use of properly muffled construction equipment should be required on the job site. Peak airborne noise levels from pile diving may be as much as 15 dBA greater than noise levels shown in FIGURE 4 for non-impulsive (steady) construction noise sources. Although the pile driving can produce more intense noise levels, each pulse is of short individual duration (less than one second). Therefore, its impact on speech communication is not as severe as that of steady source of the same noise level. Severe noise imoacts are not expected to occur inside air conditioned structures which are within 70 to 450 FT of the project construction site. Inside naturally ventilated structures, interior noise levels (with windows or doors opened) are estimated to range between 55 to 73 dBA at 70 FT to 450 FT distances from the construction site. Closure of all doors and windows facing the construction site would generally reduce interior noise levels by an additional 5 to 10 dBA. The incorporation of State Department of Health construction noise limits and curfew times, which are applicable throughout the State of Hawaii (Reference 4), is another noise mitigation measure which is normally applied to construction activities. FIGURE 5 depicts the normally permitted hours of construction. Noisy construction activities are not allowed on Sundays and holidays, during the early morning, and during the late evening and nighttime periods under the DOH permit procedures. Vibration from Pile Driving. Pile driving will probably be necessary to implant piles into the ground over the project site. lmpact driven concrete and sheet piles may both be used on the project site. Induced ground vibrations from the pile driving operations have the potential to cause architectural and structural damage to structures. Ground vibrations generated during pile driving operations are generally described in terms of peak particle (or ground) velocity in units of inches/second. The human being is very sensitive to ground vibrations, which are perceptible at relatively low particle velocities of 0.01 to 0.04 inches/second. Damage to structures, however, occur at much higher levels of vibration as indicated in TABLE 5. The most commonly used damage criteria for structures is the 2.0 inches/second limit derived from work by the U.S. Bureau of Mines. A more conservative limit of 0.2 inches/second is also used, and is suggested for planning purposes on this project because of the repetitive nature of pile driving operations which can increase risks of damage due to fatiguing. Based on measured vibration levels during pile driving operations under various soil conditions and at various distances, estimates of ground vibration levels vs. distance from the pile driver have been made for various soil conditions and for various Page 22-0 !) o N(t AVAILABLE WORK HOURS UNDER DOH PERMIT PROCEDURES FOR CONSTRUCTION NOISEFIGURE 5WKDAYS HOLIDAYS SATURDAY SUNDAY I\\IEEKLY NORMAL PERMIT 55 O 9 O 6{ Hou.a WEEKDAYS SATURDAYS Mid;G-46sloNoon2l6aloMidnightTime of DaYTABLE 5 SUMMARY 0.5 to 0.15 0.04 0.011.3 1.0 0.6 0.4 0.2Malor damage to bulldlngs (mean of data).

FIGURE 6, which was extracted from Reference 8, may be used to predict vibration levels for the soil conditions indicated. When coral layers must be penetrated, vibration levels can be expected to be higher than those shown in FIGURE 6, particularly if the adjacent structures are supported by the common coral layer. From FIGURE 6, and for wet sand soil conditions, the 0.2 inches/second vibration damage criteria will be exceeded at a scaled energy distance factor of approximately 0.7. The scaled energy distance factor is equal to the square root of the energy (in foot-pounds) per blow of the hammer divided by the distance (in feet) between the pile tip and the monitoring location. For a 2,500 foot-pound small pile driver, a scaled energy distance of 0.7 equates to a required separation distance of 71 FT. Under clay soil conditions, and using the prediction procedures contained in FIGURE 6, a shorter separation distance o'f 47 FT is required to not exceed the 0.2 inches/second criteria when using a 2,500 foot-pound pile driver. lt should be noted that 0.2 inches/second vibration levels were measured from a much larger 22,400 foofpound pile driver at even shorter separation distances of approximately 30 FT in sandy, layered soil (Reference 9). The measurement data reported in Reference 9 are significantly lower than the vibration levels predicted by the methodology of Reference 8. As indicated above, predictions of peak ground vibration levels vs. scaled energy distance factor from the driven pile are not precise, with initial uncertainty factor for a given location in the order of 10:1 . For this reason, it is standard practice to employ seismograph monitoring of ground vibrations during pile driving operations with a 3-axis geophone or accelerometer. lf sheet pile drivers of approximately 2,500 foolpounds or smaller ratings are anticipated to be used on the job site, the initial vibration predictions indicate that there is some risk of exceeding the 0.2 inches/second vibration damage criteria at 47 to 71 FT separation distances, and monitoring during pile driving operations is warranted if pile driving are planned at those distances from any existing structures. For pile driver operations, risks of damage to the buildings across Halekauwila Street are considered to be very low. The following preventative measures are recommended for implementation during the planning and design phases ofthe project: . In addition to the normal planning and design concerns regarding potential damage due to settling and heaving during construction, consideration should also be given to risks of damage due to vibration from pile driving. A damage criteria of 0.2 inches/second should be used in conjunction with the vibration prediction method of Reference 8 to identify the potential damage risk distances to the driven oiles. . lf predicted vibration levels from pile driving exceed 0.2 inches/second at a building, and predicted levels cannot be reduced by sizing of the pile driver, test piles should be driven and their vibrations monitored and recorded prior to completion of the foundation design. The monitoring of the test piles should be Page 25VIBRATION INTENSIW VERSUS SCALED ENERGY 10.0 5.0 o I > o.s F6oJuJ lrJ J9 F d o'r 0.05 0.01 5.0 .t0.0 i10,0 YENEBGJ-=-EI-LE DISTANCE - FTPlasler EXPECTED FROM PILE DRIVING Page 26FIGURE 6designed to measure the expected peak, 3-axis vibration levels at the buirding.The results of the monitoring should be used to define empirical oistince tromthe driven pile to the 0.2 inches/second damage risk location, and to evaruatethe risks of structural damage to the adjacent structure during actuar con-struction. . lf predicted vibration levels from pile driving exceed 2.0 inches/second at abuilding, the use of alternate types of piles oi shoring should be considered forimplementation during the design phase. Honolulu Fixed Guideway system Noise. The Halekauwila place living units arenot planned to be air conditioned, so noise mitigation measures will not be included inthe project plans. However, wall openings in the living units will be provideJ for theaddition of air conditioning units by the building's occupants. lf the Halekauwila place project is completed prior to the completion of ihe Honolulu Fixed Guidewav sv\"tem, itis.possible that.noise mitigation measures at Halekauwila etace may Fixed c,ldewSy system project.

The Departmenl of Oesign and Conshuction has lhe following comments to offerl The statement on page 21 otthe DEA that Mother Waldron Neighborhood park is scheduled for extenslve improvoment with new landscaping in year 2010 is not correct. The Cily has not appropriated lunds and has no plans to make additional improvements at Mother Waldron Neighbohood Pa* in the near future. The last improvement made was the installation of a children's play apparatug in 2005. We are con@med about the increased number of residenlial units and lhe broader age group oflhe clientele for the State's affordable housing project sinc\u20ac lhe City engagod in a joint master plan forthe superblock with the State Department of Educalion and Hawaii Community Developmenl Authority (HCDA) approximatety ten yeaF ago. At that lime. the project was specifically for elderly-assisted housing and had proposed a total of 200 one-bedroom and studio units in a fourleen story high-rise_ The present projeci proposes a nineteen story building containing 204 units in a mixlure of sizes of units up to three-bedrooms, as well as a separate pa*ingtownhouse facility having tar more parking capacity than the project originally proposed in 2000. We believe the proposed housing pan changes may cause se ous adverse recreational impacts to the communitywhich is already underseaved by scarce public, active-recreational parks. We \u20acspeclftily \u20acquest that the HCDA, or the applicant,Mf.
