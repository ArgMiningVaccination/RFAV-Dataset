The primary purpose of the two options is to provide healthcare choices to Medicare beneficiaries; however, their structural and cost differences could result in quite dif ferent experiences for beneficiaries obtaining care within each option. This research will look at differences in experiences of care between beneficiaries that are enrolled in MA and FFS with a diagnosis of diabetes. Methods: This study utilizes data c ollected in the 2009 Medicare Consumer Assessment of Healthcare Providers and Systems (MCAHPS) survey. The 2009 MCAHPS survey includes a nationally representative sample of Medicare beneficiaries who were surveyed about different aspects of the health care experiences. This study will focus on Medicare beneficiaries who reported their doctor telling them they have diabetes. The study will utilize Univariate and Multivariable logistic regression models to examine the relationship of experience of care outcom es between beneficiaries in FFS and MA programs taking into account demographic and health characteristics of diabetic beneficiaries. Results: Results show that Medicare beneficiaries who are White are more likely to report positive experiences for all t he outcome variables in the analyses with and without taking demographic and health variables into account. Enrollees with more than a high school education report better experience with understanding a doctor's explanation than those with a high school e ducation or less; older enrollees that are 65 and older report better experiences for all outcome variables than enrollees who are younger than 65. iii There is not a statistically significant difference in the way that males and females report experiences of care for the outcome variables. Conclusion: This is the first time a study has been done looking at experiences of care for Medicare beneficiaries with a diagnosis of diabetes enrolled in MA and FFS Medicare options. The information generated by this resea rch will be valuable to policy makers, quality improvement organizations, and other stakeholders as they explore and refine quality improvement strategies for patient experience of care, specifically for patient with chronic conditions like diabetes, acros s the Medicare program.

Introduction 1.1 Background In 2001, the Institute of Medicine (IOM) identified patient -centeredness as one of six aims for improving the quality of U.S. health care in Crossing the Quality Chas [IOM, 2001] . Since that time, there has been a growing movement towards measuring patients' experiences with care. T he IOM defined patient centeredness as \" health care t hat establishes a partnership among practitioners, patients, and their families to ensure that decisions respect patients' wants, needs, and preferences and that patients have the education and support they need to make decisions and participate in their o wn care [IOM, 2001 ]. For many years, the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS) have been measuring patient experience through the MCAHPS (Medicare Consumer Assessment of Health care Provider Systems) s urvey. The results of the MCAHPS survey are p ublicly reported on the Medicare.Gov website to help patients assess provider performance and make informed decisions when choosing providers. Publicly reporting the results of the survey fosters transparency and accountability among health care providers and sets benchmarks and incentives for improving care. Over the years, CMS has used the survey to examine characteristics of Medicare enrollees and their experience of care within the two insurance options of the Medicare program. One option is Fee-for-Service (FFS) Medicare, where beneficiaries are free to choose their own physicians and other providers, but they also are solely responsible for navigating the health care system. The other option is Medicare Ad vantage private plans, where enrollees have b roader benefits with lower out -of-pocket costs, but they may be constrained in their provider choices and health care options. Studies conducted in the 2 last decade have used the survey to examine quality of care in the Medicare program and found that Medic are Fee-for-Service (FFS) and Medicare Advantage (MA ) beneficiaries experienced similar hospital admission rates for colon cancer and stroke hospital admissions, comparable admission rates for ambulatory care sensitive conditions, and comparable access t o ambulatory care services (Brown 1993, Harlow and McCall 2003). Managed care (MA) beneficiari es were found to be more likely than FFS beneficiaries to receive preventive services including influenza and pneumococcal vaccinations (Landon et al. 2004, Key hani et al. 2007). However, FFS beneficiaries were found to be more satisfied with their overall care (Landon et al. 2004, Miller and Luft 1997, 2002). A study comparing Healthcare Effectiveness Data and Information Set (HEDIS) quality of care measures for MA and FFS, found that, low -income and minority status are associated with poorer preventive care outcomes in both FFS and MA (Zaslavsky et al. 2000). A more focused examination of similarities and differences in quality of care between MA and FFS o ptions requires the examination of experience with care by individuals with similar health disorder s. This research compare s patient reported experience of care between Medicare beneficiaries enrolling in MA and FFS programs with a diagnosis of diabetes . Survey responses to experience with care questions were obtained from those beneficiaries who reported that they had a usual source of care : (1) were seen by a doctor in the previous six months, ( 2) had made an appointment to see a specialist in previous six months ( 3) had tried to obtain any kind of care, tests, or treatment through Medicare in the previous six months , (4) or had tried to fill a prescription through Medicare Part D in the previous 6 months among those that have Part D . 3 The beneficiaries with diabetes who report that they did not receive one or more servic es, as well as those who report worse experiences of care may be the most policy relevant group s in this research given the importance of continuity of care, periodic testing, specialty s ervices, and use of medications in the management of diabetes . The primary source of data is the 2009 Medicare Consumer Assessment of Health Providers and Systems Survey (MCAHPS). Evaluating quality of care and the beneficiary's experience with care in th e Medicare populati on is complex. The work by the Dartmouth Atlas has documented wide geographical variations in different parts of the country in the receipt of evidence -based care and in level and type of health care utilization for Medicare beneficiarie s (Wennberg et al. 2008). A recent study found that the geographic \"disparities\" in use of evidence - based services are more pronounced than are racial disparities in care (Fisher et al. 2008). Studies of variation in services have identified many correl ates, including com munity practice patterns and physician supply, after adjusting for population characteristics. These studies suggest there are many sources of variation in utilization and quality beyond differences between MA or FFS models of care. 1.2 Defining Patient Experience of Care Patient experience surveys elicit reports from patients on what they did or did not experience in their interactions with providers and the health care system. The literature suggest that patient experience of care involves aspects of care experience such as waiting times, communication with health -care providers, providing information to patients, emotional and physical support, and involvement of family and friends ; all of which may be potential priorities for qual ity improvement. 4 1.3 Overview of the Medicare Program Medicare enrollees have the option to choose the Fee-for-Service (FFS) program, in which a majority of beneficiaries are enrolled (75% or 37million) , either with or without a freestanding prescription drug plan (Part D). Enrollees can also enroll in a Medicare Advantage (MA) plan, whereby managed care plans are under contract with CMS, with or without a prescription drug option , to provide services to beneficiaries. These MA plans include: Health Maint enance Organizations (HMOs), Local Preferred Provider Organizations (PPOs), Private Fee for Service (PFFS) plans, Special Needs Plans (SNPs), and Regional PPOs. These various Medicare opti ons have structural differences that could result in different exper iences for beneficiaries. For example, in FFS Medicare, beneficiaries can choose their own providers, but they also are solely responsible for navigating the health care system. Enrollees in the MA plans have expanded benefits at lower out -of-pocket costs, but they are constrained in their provider choices and health care options (KFF.org). Given the differences in MA plan offerings, beneficiaries in MA may have quite different experience s depending on the plans they choose. The following table presents a comparison of the two options of Medicare in terms of coverage and costs. Table 1 .1: Comparison of Medicare FFS and MA Coverage and Out-of-Pocket Costs in 20 12 Coverage Type Covered Services Premiums Deductibles Co-Insurance FFS Part A - Hospital Insurance - everyone that's qualified is automatically enrolled hospital services skilled nursing facility, No premiums $1,156 for an inpatient stay $289 per day for extended inpatient stays 5 home health, and hospice care Part B - Supplementary Medi cal Insurance - Voluntary physician visits, Preventive services such as mammography and colorectal screening. ambulance services, clinical laboratory services durable medical equipment (such as wheelchairs and oxygen) kidney supplies and services outpatie nt mental health care diagnostic tests, such as x -rays. Income related monthly premium ranging from $99.90 to $319.70.60 $ 140 Most require a 20% co insurance Part D - Prescription Drug Coverage - Voluntary 2012 Part D National Base Beneficiary Premium - $31 plus income - related monthly adjusted amount ranging from $11.60 - $66.40). Up to $320 25 % coinsurance on covered drugs up to an initial coverage limit MA (Part C) Provide all benefits covered under traditional Medicare plans including Part A and Part B and its premiums. Most Part C plans do not have additional monthly premium. However, for those that do, it varies by plan up to about Up to $320 25 % coinsurance on covered drugs up to an initial coverage limit Provide different benefit package to benef iciaries and 6 payment systems to providers $100. Most provide Part D coverage (MA -PD) as discussed in the FFS group above. Those enrolled in MA -PD pay average monthly premium of $56. Enrollees can choose not to enroll in Part D (MA -only) Cover addit ional benefits not covered by traditional Medicare, such as routine vision and dental care * Source: Medicare & You.

For example, 2009 enrollees in FFS Medicare had access to a limited number of prevent ative services covered by Medi care, mainly mammography and colorectal screening , where those enrolled in MA have access to additional benefits not covered by traditional Medicare, such as routine vision and dental care. Note, FFS Medicare now covers a full range of preventive services since passage of the Affordable Care Act. Also, beneficiaries enrolled in MA plans that offer a prescription drug option are limited to that plan's PD coverage where those FFS enrollees can pick from the full array of standalone PD plans. 7 1.5 Diabet es Mellitus: Prevalence, Outcome, Cost, and Treatment Diabetes mellitus is one of the more prevalent chronic disorders in the western world and the prevalence is increasing (Narayan et al. 2003). The number of individuals in the United States with diagnose d diabetes is expected to increase by 165% between 2000 and 2050, with the fastest increases occurring in older and minority subpopulations (Narayan et al. 2003). The disorder is a metabolic disorder resulting from a defect in insulin secretion, insulin ac tion, or both. A co nsequence is chronic hyperglycemia (i.e. elevated levels of plasma glucose) with disturbances of carbohydrate, fat and protein metabolism. Although the onset of type 2 diabetes is usually less dramatic than that of type 1, both types of diabetes carry a risk of disabling, yet potentially preventable complications (DCCT 1993). Diabetes affects large numbers of people across the range of racial and ethnic groups and at all social and economic levels. It is estimated that 25.6 million people in the United Stat es age 20 and above have diabetes (Diabetes.org , 2010 ). According to the fact sheet on Diabetes.org, of people that are age 65 and over, 10.9 million, or 26.9% of all people in this age group have diabetes; 13.0 million, or 11.8% of all men and 12.6 millio n, or 10.8 % of all females aged 20 years or older have diabetes. There are race and ethnic differences in prevalence of diagnosed diabetes also. Data from the 2011 National Diabetes Fact Sheet for people diagnosed with diabetes, aged 20 years or older include the following prevalence by race/ethnicity: 7.1% of non -Hispanic Whites, 8.4% of Asian Americans, 12.6% of non -Hispanic blacks, 11.8% of Hispanics. About two million new cases of diabetes were diagnosed in people aged 20 yea rs and o lder in 2010. (Diabetes .org). 8 Complications from diabetes can be delayed or prevented through good clinical care and patient self -management. People with diabetes are two to four times more likely to develop cardiovascular disease than people without dia betes, making it the most common complication of diabetes (IDF 2001). In the United States, diabetes is the most common cause of blindness among working -age adults, the most common cause of non -traumatic amputations and end -stage renal disease, and the six th most common cause of death (Williamson et al. 2004 ). The economic and human cost of the disease is devastating. In 2007, diabetes was listed as the underlying cause on 71,382 death certificates and was listed as a contributing factor on an additional 16 0,022 death certificates. This means that diabetes contributed to a total of 231,404 deaths (Diabetes.org). Taking into account age and sex distribution among persons with diabetes, the total cost of diabetes in the U.S., including disabilit y, work loss, a nd premature mortality, was estimated to be $174 billion in 2007 (Bojadzieyski et al 2011). The average medical expenditures among people with diagnosed diabetes were 2.3 times higher than expenditures for persons without diabetes (Diabetes.org). Nutrition al intake and modification of lifestyle have been found to be the cornerstone s for treating type 2 diabetes. Successful management of diabetes generally requires ongoing education and support to equip people with the knowledge, skills, attitudes and motiv ation required to manage their diabetes care effectively (WHO, 1998). A number of research studies have found that effective management of diabetes lies almost entirely in the hands of the patient who lives with the condition (The Cochrane Collaboration 20 09). There is increasing evidence that people with diabetes can improve their self -efficacy and general health once they have been empowered to take the lead in managing their chronic 9 disease (The Cochrane Collaboration 2009). Physicians reporting that the y discussed content areas of diabetes self -care with their patients were found to have better agreement on treatment strategies with their patients. Better agreement on treatment goals and strategies was associated both with greater patient self -efficacy a nd self -management of diabetes (Heisler et al, 2003). Improving care for more than one -quarter of Medicare beneficiaries with diabetes has the potential for reducing total costs to Medicare, as well as for improving the lives of these beneficiaries. The c osts, medical problems , and quality of life associated with diabetes can be improved if: patients are provided with preventive medical care and timely follow - up that is consistent with recommended standards; patients adhere to recommended medication, self -care regimens, diet; and if providers communicate better with each other and with patients. This is particularly relevant not just to those beneficiaries that report having worse experiences of care, but also for those that report not receiving one or mor e services within the previous six months. Because of managed care 's incentive to improve the bottom -line, many health plans have adopted care models to better manage care of patient with chronic conditions like diabetes. MA plans have been found to be bet ter at providing programs that are designed to improve patients' adherence to treatment regimens and physician's adherence to professional guidelines. For example, strategies that have been routinely used by MA plans to enhance primary care of patient with diabetes \u2014including home visits, care transitions, and care coordination \u2014 have been shown to be effective in reducing hospitalization and readmission rates for Medicare beneficiaries with diabetes ( Experton et al, 1999 ). However, FFS do es not provide such services. In FFS in 2009 , the coverage 10 model did not strongly encourage preventive or follow -up care for people with chronic diseases such as diabetes mainly because of the Fee-for-Service structure of traditional Medicare; where providers are paid for cli nical services delivered to the patient and not for services related to educate patient s about self-management skills that are so essential in the management of diabetes. Thus, in FFS Medicare, there is less incentive for providers to coordinate the care o f patient or provide preventive type services that will reduce the need for hospitalization for beneficiaries with diabetes (who may also have other chronic conditions). Given the differences in care models for this population in the Medicare progr am, one might expect the experience of care to be better for diabetic Medicare beneficiaries enrolled in MA (given its better management of chronic conditions) as compared to those enrolled in FFS. 1.6 Quality of Care in MA vs. FFS CAHPS is currently the only so urce of quality of care data , for which the results are publicly reported, on both MA and FFS. The MCAHPS survey captures information on several dimensions of the patient's perspective of care. For this study, four of these dimensions will be explored; th ese dimensions are: (1) experience with your personal doctor, (2) experience with getting healthcare from specialists, (3) experience with your drug plan (MA -PDs and FFS -PDs) , and (4) experience with your health care (tests and treatments received). A few studies have looked at the relationship between CAHPS survey responses and clinical care and outcomes documented in the medical chart. One study conducted by Schneider et al. (2001) found associations between enrollees' reports about health plans as meas ured by the Consumer Assessment of Health Providers Systems (CAHPS) survey 11 and the quality of clinical care as measured by the Healthcare Effectiveness Data and Information Set (HEDIS). The study found that health plans that provided better access and cust omer service also provided better clinical care based on chart reviews. This finding suggests better patient experience with care is positively related to better clinical care and outcomes. Since the implementation of the Medicare Modernization Act and Part D prescription drug coverage in 2006, research studies have been examining the experience of beneficiaries enrolled in a Medicare prescription drug program. The findings have been reasonably consistent: beneficiaries enrolled in MA plans with a prescri ption drug benefit (MA -PD) were found to pay less out -of-pocket and to be less likely to delay refilling or not filling prescriptions. They were more likely to need to obtain prior approval to get prescriptions filled when prescribed a brand name drug as compared to FS -PD enrollees (Neuman et al. 200 7). MA -PD enrollees were more likely to take advantage of the 90 day mail -order option to fill prescriptions for chronic medications than FS -PD enrollees (Neuman et al. 200 7). There is a growing body of resea rch comparing quality of care between MA and FFS Medicare beneficiaries overall and not limited to individuals with a specific chronic disease, e.g., diabetes. Four published studies were identified that compared quality of care between MA and FFS using t he MCAHPS data. One study (Landon et al. 2004), found MA and FFS enrollees to be similar to each other and to the Medicare population as a whole in terms of education, distribution of age, and health status. With respect to experience of care, the study fo und that FFS enrollees rated the overall care they received from Medicare more highly than MA enrollees rated their care. FFS beneficiaries rated experience with their personal physicians higher than did MA enrollees. Similarly, FFS 12 enrollees reported fewe r problems with getting needed care. The study also found that MA enrollees reported significantly fewer problems with paperwork, getting information, and customer service; as well as more likely to report having received preventive services such as immuni zations for influenza and pneumococcus and, if smokers, were more likely to report having received counseling to quit smoking. In addition, the above study found that differences in care experiences between FFS and MA varied across regions of the country. Another study looking at care experience received by subgroups of sick and healthy beneficiaries in FFS and MA used the 2004 CAHPS data (Keenan et al. 2009). According to this study, no differences in health status were found between enrollees in FFS and MA plans. The study did find that beneficiaries enrolled in MA plans reported less favorable care experiences than those in FFS, both among healthier and less healthy enrollees. These results are consistent with previous research showing care experiences were more favorable in FFS compared with MA overall. The study also found preventive services, specifically the flu, pneumonia and smoking cessation advice, was more common among the less healthy group in MA as compared to FFS . A third study looking at whe ther disparities in health care experiences of Medicare beneficiaries differ between MA and traditional Fee-for-Service (FFS) Medicare using the CAHPS data , found that Hispanics and Blacks reported less positive evaluations than Whites in MA (Elliott et. a l 2011). The study also found disparities in patient care experience among lower income, less healthy, female, less educated, and Black Medicare beneficiaries, as compared to their counterparts . The disparities tended to be larger (more negative) in MA t han in FFS. For the prescription drug program, the study found 13 disparities for lower income, less healthy, female, less educated, and Black Medicare beneficiaries, relative to their counterparts. Again, the disparities tended to be larger (more negative) in MA -PD than in FFS -PD. A fourth study looking at geographic variations in CAHPS scores between MA and FFS found significant variation in performance between MA and FFS in the domains of immunization, customer service, and Part D services. For example, Ca lifornia MA consistently exceeded the national MA average, whereas California Fee-for-Service generally lagged the national average as compared to FFS in other parts of the U.S. (Farley et al. 2011). These results are consistent with findings from other st udies that found variations in performance across quality measures within the same geographic areas (Landon et al. 2004; Gillies et al. 2006). These variations have been attributed to a number of factors. First, the design of the two health insurance optio ns - where beneficiaries in Fee-for-Service Medicare can choose their physicians and other providers freely, whereas beneficiaries enrolled in the MA plans are limited to receiving care from a specific group practice which may influence patient -reported q uality measures . Second, individual MA plans vary in their approaches to working with contracted medical practices and this may affect how patients experience the care they receive from physicians in those practices. For example, studies have found that t he structure of a health plan is related to the duration of office visits by elderly patients (Farley et al. 2011) and that a health plan's method of paying physicians (e.g., FFS or salary plus bonus) can affect patients' experiences of care (Farley et al. 2011). In addition to the literature review above, a number of studies have compared quality of care indicators between Medicare managed care and FFS populations for specific 14 conditions but not for diabetes. In general, these studies found that Medicare F FS and MA beneficiaries had similar hospital admission rates for colon cancer and stroke, comparable patterns of admission for ambulatory care sensitive conditions, and access to ambulatory care (Brown 1993, Harlow and McCall 2003). Managed care beneficiar ies were more likely than FFS beneficiaries to receive influenza and pneumococcal vaccinations and other preventive services (Landon et al. 2004, Keyhani et al. 2007). However, FFS beneficiaries were more satisfied with their care (Landon et al. 2004, Miller and Luft 1997 , 2002 ). 1.7 Contributing Factors to Varying Quality of Care Previous research has consistently found socio -demographic factors explain significant variations in experiences of care reported in FFS and MA enrollee s. Studies have found that Medicare beneficiaries with low socioeconomic status (SES) were more likely to face barriers to receiving quality care (Kapur et al.2006, Elliott et al. 2011). Research on both Medicare FFS and MA plans concluded that seniors wit h low SES used fewer services than those with high SES. In particular, studies have found that Medicare beneficiaries with low SES, unlike those with higher SES, were less knowledgeable of the benefits of good health behaviors, and hence may have been more likely to experience worse outcomes (Kapur et al.2006) . SES has been found to be related to the types of services utilized. For example, better educated persons have been found to prefer receiving care from specialist s rather than generalists or primary c are physicians (Kapur et al. 2006). While these disparities are found in both FFS and managed care settings, there are differences with regards to the impact of these disparities on quality and experience of care between the two settings. For example, bene ficiaries in managed care 15 who have little or no education have been found to be less successful in navigating the managed care setting. In other words, enrollees in managed care who have little or no education may face worse disparities compared to their c ounterparts in FFS where providers have little or no incentives to limit use of services (Elliott et. al 2011). Other researchers have supported that minorities in managed care plans have worse outcomes relative to Whites than do those in Medicare FFS (Bon ito et al. 2004). The suggested reason has been that managed care limit s freedom to seek care from any provider . One study reported that gatekeeping by MA plans was especially detrimental to racial and ethnic minorities who may be seeking to locate cultura lly appropriate providers (Bonito et al. 2004). On the other hand, one can argue (as in the case of SES) that managed care attributes of facilitating and coordinating access to services may work to the advantage of minority patient s by encouraging them to use more routine and preventive services. One can also argue that the lower out -of-pocket costs for patients in managed care (compared to those in FFS) may increase utilization among minorities who tend to have lower incomes. For example, the study by Bal sa et al. 2007, found that managed care, relative to FFS, increased the likelihood that Hispanics had a usual source of care (relative to Whites) by 8.6%. In the study, Hispanics in managed care were less likely to delay care for costs reasons, relative to Whites, than Hispanics in FFS. Disparities in quality of care by gender in the two settings have been found. For example, influenza and pneumococcal immunizations have been reported to be higher in male s relative to females in both MA and FFS (B onito et a l. 2004). The study by Bird et al.2007, found gender differences of quality of care for cardiovascular disease and diabetes in Medicare enrollees as it relates to screening, treating, and outcomes for these 16 conditions. This study found lower quality of car e for women despite the fact that women typically have higher rates of physician visits than men. The Medicare population includes beneficiaries who are disabled and have low incomes. These individuals may be eligible for enrollment in Medicaid in additio n to Medicare, usually referred to as being dual eligible. According to the Kaiser Family Foundation website (KFF.org), there were about 9 million dual eligibles in the Medicare program in 2012. These beneficiaries are more likely than other Medicare bene ficiaries have a cognitive or mental impairment, to be frail, live with multiple chronic conditions and cost intensive [KFF.org]. With relatively high rates of cognitive limitations, a larger share of dual eligible than other Medicare beneficiaries live in a facility, such as a nursing home or mental health facility (13% of dual eligible versus 1% of non -dual eligibles) [KFF.org]. Note , the MCAHPS does not include beneficiaries in the survey that reside in institutional settings. In 20 12, dual eligible beneficiaries comprised 20 percent of the Medicare population (KFF.org). This is consistent with the 2009 Consumer Assessment of Healthcare Provider and System ( CAHPS ) survey data which consists of 20.3% du als (n=137,847) out of the original sample of 640,413 . Previous s tudies have shown that dual eligible beneficiaries differ from other Medicare beneficiaries in several ways. For example, they are more likely to have mental and physical impairments, multiple comorbid conditions or more serious health conditi ons, and are likely to remain in Fee-for-Service Medicare or disenroll from MA plans [Nicholas, 2009]. In addition, these beneficiarie s have been found to be more likely to be younger than 65 and to report lower health status compare to other Medicare bene ficiaries [ KFF.org ]. Note, eligibility for Medicare under age 65 is generally limited 17 to persons with disabilit ies. They are also more likely to be a member of a racial or ethnic minority [ KFF.org ]. 1.8 Specific Aims and Research Hypotheses The hypot heses to be examined in this study are discussed below under each of the three specific aims. Aim 1: Aim 1 examines differences in MA and FFS diabetic patient characteristics including age, gender, race, education, region of residence, self -reported he alth status, dual eligibility, disability, comorbidity, and proxy assistance. Differences in proportion of diabetic beneficiaries who were asked about experience with care (i.e., reported a usual provider and received care in the prior 6 months) are exam ined. Hypothesis 1 .1: Proposes that a higher proportion of MA enrollees as compared to FFS with diabetes will be younger, male, lower educational attainment, non -whites and living in urban areas and a higher proportion of FFS enrollees will be disabled, dually eligible for both Medicare and Medicaid, and use proxy help to respond to the survey. Hypothesis 1.2: Proposes that a h igher proportion of MA enrollees as compared to FFS with diabetes will report that their personal doctor explains things in a way that was easier to understand; it was easier to receive a test or treatment; or is was easier to fill a prescription. A higher proportion of FFS enrollees will report greater ease with getting an appointment to see a specialist as compared to MA enrollees . 18 Aim 2: Examine the relationship of age, race, gender, education, self -reported health status, disability, proxy assistance, region of residence, as well as co -morbidities and dual eligibility and how this varies between MA and FFS, among those who have received one or more services and responded to the patient -reported experience questions. Hypothesis 2.1: Proposes that a fter controlling for beneficiary socio -demographics and health characteristics, beneficiaries in both MA and FFS who have a high sc hool education or less will be found to have worse experience of care. In addition, those in MA with a high school education or less will be found to have worse experience of care than those in FFS with a high school education or less. Hypothesis 2.2: Prop oses that b eneficiaries in FFS and MA with diabetes who are White will be more likely to report a positive experience with care than non -whites after controlling for soc io-demographics and health characteristics. Hypothesis 2.3: Proposes that Medicare be neficiaries with diabetes who are 65 years and older in both MA and FFS will more frequently report a positive experience with obtaining care than those younger than age 65 after controlling for socio -demographics and health characteristics. Medicare bene ficiaries with diabetes who are 75 years and older in both MA and FFS will more frequently report a positive experience with obtaining care than those younger than 75 after controlling for socio -demographics and health characteristics. Hypothesis 2.4: Prop oses that b eneficiaries who are females will report less positive experience with their overall care in both MA and FFS than males; females in FFS will report more positive experience with care than those in MA after controlling for socio - demographics and health characteristics . 19 AIM 3: Examine the relationship of age, race, gender, education, self -reported health status, region of residence, co -morbidities, dual eligibility, disability, and proxy assistance with survey on filling a prescription in the pr evious six months; among those who filled prescriptions, examine how the diabetic population reports experience with Part D and how this varies between MA -PD and FFS -PD. Hypothesis 3.1: Proposes that Medicare enrollees with diabetes who are age 65 or older are expected to be more positive with their experience in obtaining prescription medications than those younger than 65; and in general, those enrollees in MA -PD plans are expected to be more positive than enrollees in FFS -PD after controlling for socio - demographics and health characteristics. Hypothesis 3.1a: Proposes that Medicare enrollees with diabetes who are age 75 or older are expected to be more positive with their experience in obtaining prescription medications than those younger than 75; after c ontrolling for socio -demographics and health characteristics. Hypothesis 3.2: Proposes that Whites with diabetes in both MA -PD and FFS -PD are expected to be more likely to have filled a prescription in the previous 6 months and more satisfied with their e xperience in obtaining prescriptions than non -whites after controlling for all other variables. However, Whites in MA -PD will be more satisfied with their experience in obtaining prescriptions medications than those in free standing PDPs. 20 Hypothesis 3.3: Proposes that b eneficiaries in MA -PD and FFS -PD with diabetes who are more educated are expected to be more satisfied with their experience in obtaining prescription s than those who are less educated after controlling for other variables. 21 Chapter 2. Methods 2.1 Data Source Since 1997, CMS has been collecting information on beneficiaries' experiences with health care for Medicare Advantage (MA) and traditional Fee-for-Service (FFS) Medicare through the Medicare Consumer Assessment of Health care Provider and Systems (MCAHPS) survey. The MCAHPS survey is administered annually between February 16th and early June to a national representative random sample of Medicare beneficiaries. It asks about beneficiaries' experiences with care received i n the previous six months. In 2007, a new section was added to the survey to obtain information on patient experience with prescription drug plans under the new Medicare Pa rt D benefit, including free -standing prescription drug plans (FS -PD) and those spo nsored by a Medicare Advantage plan s (MA -PD). The 2009 MCAHPS survey, which is the data source for my study, was mailed to 680,413 beneficiaries. The adj usted response rate, after accounting for both ineligible sample members and non -respondents who were excluded, is 62.3 percent (n=399,317). The 2009 survey includes a question asking if the beneficiary has been told by a doctor that he/she has diabetes or high blood sugar. This study include s all of the respondents who answered \"yes\" to having been told by their doctor that they had diabetes when surveyed using the 2009 CAHPS survey (n=98 ,000). This study utilize s data collected in the 2009 Medicare Cons umer Assessment of Health care Providers and Systems (MCAHPS) survey. The 2009 MCAHPS survey includes a nationally representative sample of Medicare beneficiaries who were surveyed through mailed questionnaires conducted between February 16 and June 16, 2009 asking about experience in the previous six months. The study examine s the experience of four 22 subgroups of Medicare beneficiaries: (1) enrolled in a Medicare Advantage plan with prescription drug coverage (MA -PD), (2) enrolled in Medicare Advantage but the plan does not offer prescription drug coverage (MA -Only), (3) enrolled in Fee-for-Service Medicare and a Medicare drug plan (FFS -PD) and enrolled in Fee-for-Service Medicare and not enrolled in a Medicare drug plan (FFS -Only). Those not enrolled in a Medicare prescription drug (PD) plan may have private pharmacy insurance coverage through a Medi -gap plan or may have no insurance coverage for prescription drugs. Interviews included common questions across all four enrollment categories and questions adapted to the characteristics of the specific subgroup : MA Only, MA -PD, FFS -PD or FFS Only. For examp le, in the MA -PD Survey there are 82 questions, asking about: Your Health care experience (11 questions), Your Healthcare in the Last 6 Months (11 questions), Your Personal Doctor (7 questions), Getting Healthcare from Specialists (4 questions), Your Medic are Rights (3 questions), Your Prescription Drug Plan (17 questions, asked only of those with PD benefits), and About You (29 questions). Appendix A, presents a list of the 2009 MCAHPS survey questions, response categories, and the group(s) expected to ans wer each question. The data collection protocol for the 2009 MCAHPS survey included mailing of pre - notification letters, up to two mailings of survey questionnaires , and telephone calls to conduct telephone interviews with those who did not respond to the mail questionnaire . Beneficiaries had to have been continuously enrolled in their plans for at least six months to be eligible for the survey. Beneficiaries also had to be 18 years old or older at the time the sample was drawn. Institutionalized benefic iaries were not eligible for selection and, if identified during data collection, were excluded from the analysis. Some 23 sample members and their responses were excluded due to being under 18 years of age, deceased, or identified as being in the sample for another Medicare CAHPS survey version, i.e., sample members can only be in the survey for one type of CAHPS survey (for example, cannot be in Home Health CAHPS survey, Hospital CAHPS survey etc) . This study and the survey informed consent procedures were approved by the RAND Human Subjects Protection Committee. For the 2009 CAHPS survey, a total of 680,413 beneficiaries were randomly selected. Of these, 39,889 (5.9%) beneficiaries were classified as ineligible because they were under the age of 18, institu tionalized, deceased, mentally or physically incapable, or had a language barrier that prevented them from completing the survey. Also, if the person was selected for another Medicare survey version they were considered ineligible (see Table 2.1). The adju sted response rate, after accou nting for both ineligible sample members and non-respondents to the telephone follow -up, is 62.3 percent. There were 98, 726 respondents to the survey who responded positively to the question \"has a doctor ever told you that you had diabetes or high blood sugar?\" This will be the study group. Table 2.1. Sample Disposition, 2009 Medicare CAHPS Survey Disposition Sample Member Count Percentage of Sample Completed survey 399,317 58.69% Partially English or Spanish 7,956 1.17% Mentally or physically unable to respond 24,439 3.59% Excluded from survey prior to 427 219,365 32.24% Total sample Experience Outcome (Dependent) Variable s: Four CAHPS Measures of Patient Experience The outcome s of interest examined in this study are self-reported beneficiary experienc e with care using scores from the following four CAHPS questions : (1) In the last 6 months, how often did your personal doctor explain things in a way that was easy to understand? (2) In the last 6 months, how often was it easy to get the care, tests or treatment you thought you needed through Medicare? (3) In the last 6 months, how often was it easy to get appointments with specialists? (4) In the last 6 months, how often was it easy to use Medicare to get the medicines your doctor prescribed? Screening qu estions preceded each of the four outcome questions to exclude individuals not using each service in the previous six months. If the services have been used, the outcomes questions have four response categories : always=4, usually=3, sometimes=2, and never =1. The first th ree questions were expected to be answered by all beneficiaries in the MA and FFS groups . The fourth question pertained to only the MA -PD and the FS - PD groups . These four experiences of care questions represent quality indicator s associated with successful treatment of chronic condition s. Particularly in the case of diabetes, health care providers would be less likely to achieve positive health outcomes without effective communication with patients about the disease. Good health outcomes correlate to patient adherence to a treatment plan including getting the care, tests and 1 Please see sample exclusion crite ria in text on previous page. 25 treatment they need. In addition, specialty care will likely be a need to prevention of complications that are associated with diabetes. Further, medications are an essen tial part of managing this disease for many diabetics and non-adherence to medication can lead to poor o utcomes including death. For each question, a dichotomous variable was created by combining beneficiaries who answered \"always\" and \"usually\" in one c ategory and combining beneficiaries who answered \"never \" or \"sometimes\" in the second category . One reason for this division is that those beneficiaries who answered \"never\" or \"sometimes\" to a particular question are reporting the substantial difficulty o r dissatisfaction with the specific service and the numbers of respondents in these two subgroups are substantially smaller than those responding more positively. 2.3 Independent Variables Table 2.2 shows the major independent variables and their distributional characteristics. These include MA vs. FFS , having a Part D drug plan, and beneficiary characteristics including age, gender, education, race, self-reported health status, co morbidities, dual eligibility for Medicaid , and whether a proxy helped complete the survey .

This study, is examining the influence of key structural characteristics or diffe rences between the two enrollment options of the Medicare program on experience of care for enrollees. As discussed in the overview of the Medicare program above, differences in benefit package and payment policies in the two Medicare options represent str uctural differences . These structural differences, according to Donabedian, can influence the method by which health care is provided or process of care, and may impact outcome as the consequence of the health care provided. 30 Structur al charact eristics, su ch as insurance option, benefit package, and region of residence can be strongly related to access to health services which may have an impact on outcomes such as experience of care. As the diagram below illustrates, structure is related to process charact eristics, such as use of services , in the form of how services are delivered, and the types of services that are covered by insurance and used. Structural aspects such as insurance coverage and benefit design are important in determining what services are accessed, whic h is expected to influence the process of care. Structure and process characteristics are expected to influence outcomes , such as how satisfied the patient will be with their experiences as they navigate the healthcare system. In summary, the model below suggests that aspects of insurance option such as payment and types of services covered (structure) can influence access to services and h ow those services are delivered (process) and can impact patient experience of care received (outcome). 31 Figure 1: Conceptual Framework for Assessing Patient Experience with Care in the Medicare Program Person Characteristics Self reported diabetes SES-race, ender, age, education Use of Services Doctor visits past 6 months?

These questions are asked o f all enrollees in MA and FFS plans. As described above, the four response categories are collapsed into two categories: positive experience (always and usually) and negative experience (sometimes and never). The question in the survey regarding \"Your Pre scription Drug Plan\" has response options of always=4, usually=3, sometimes=2, never=1 . This question is asked of those who have Part -D coverage and are enrolled in Medicare Advantage (MA -PD) and those who have Part -D coverage and in the Fee -For-Service ( FFS-PD) group. Responses are also collapsed into two categories of positive and negative experience. In the analysis, MA -PD and FFS -PD experience with filling prescriptions is compared. Note, there are MA and FFS beneficiaries who are excluded from this comparison if they do not have Part D coverage. Reasons for not having Part D coverage include having a Medi -gap insurance policy that includes pharmacy coverage, or not having pharmacy insurance and not enrolling in Medicare Part D . Table 2.5 shows the distribution of responses for each outcome question . Note, persons who reported that they had not seen their physician in the previous six months, not had lab tests, not sought care from a specialist, or not filled a prescription through the Part D drug plan were not asked to respond to the outcome question(s). Over the years, studies conducted on the CAHPS measures have demonstrated a high level of reliability and validity (Hargraves et al. 2003; AHRQ.org). Previous analyses of CAHPS data performed 33 by CM S and other researchers (Elliott et al 2011; Farley et al. 2011) have repeatedly established the construct validity of the CAHPS survey instrument by clearly showing in their analysis that there is a correlation between Medicare insurance option and benefi ciary characteristics, and how beneficiaries report their experience of care. The CAHPS survey instruments and reporting formats have undergone rigorous testing for face and content validity, including focus group interviewing, cognitive interviewing, and field-testing. Face and content validity can be established by convening one or more focus groups that include beneficiaries and individuals with subject matter expertise. Given the high degree of reliability and validity of the CAHPS survey, the proposed study is well positioned to examine the relationship between beneficiary experience of care with the two insurance options controlling for socio -demographic factors, including, education, ag e, gender, race, region of U.S. as well as other covariates that have been known to affect response tendencies.

The advantage of the dichotomous classification is that it defines clear differences in experience between beneficiaries who report a lack of satisfaction with their experience of care and those who expressed a leve l of satisfaction with their experience of care . The disadvantage is that it has not yet been formally validated 2.5 Analytic Approach The outcome s of primary interest in this study are the four patient experience outcome measures from the 2 009 CAHPS survey . These outcome variables have been collapsed into a dichotomous variable , i.e. enrollees having reported some level of positive experience (always and usually) or a negative experience ( sometimes and never) with access to care and service s. To addre ss the hypotheses of this study, the analysis applies multivaria ble logistic regression to model s to examine the relationships of independent variables and covariates to each of the four dependent variables of patient repo rted experience of care . Further, additional descriptive statistics of all of the variables to be used in this study will be performed to ensure that there are sufficient observations in all the variables being used in this study. Missing data were excluded from the analysis (see section on Methods) . Evaluation of Aim 1 : To examine differences in proportions of diabetic patient characteristics between FFS and MA , as well as differences in proportions of how the MA and FFS groups who received services in the previous 6 months and were elig ible to respond to the four experience of care measures or depend ent variables . The Chi -square test is used to determine if a statistically significant difference in proportions is present. If the p -value is less than or equal 0.05, results of the test will be considered statistically 36 significant . The same approach is used to examine differences between MA and FFS groups on individual demographic and health characteristics, including age, gender, race, comorbidity, dual status, disability, proxy assistance , health status, region, and education . Evaluation of Aim 2 : Logistic regression is used to examine each of the outcomes with type of plan (MA or FFS) and socio -demograp hic and health characteristics of the respon dent as independent variables . Because factors contributing to differences of outcomes may be related to differences in insurance coverage as well as demographic, social and health characteristics , the purpose of using a multivaria ble logistic regression is to determine whether the pa ttern of find ings from the uni variate analyses in aim 1 held when controlling for these differences . The statistical model is: Logit[ P( Experience = 1|0)] = 0 + 1X1 i + 2X2 i ...+... kXk i The dichotomous dependent variable describes the beneficiary's experience as positive or negative. The coefficients in this model can be interpreted as being the change in the log odds of a beneficiary reporting the level of their experience with care for each unit change in the covariate conditioned on all of the othe r covaria tes in the model. A statistically significant negative coefficient associated with indicators of lower education in the education catego rical variable in MA as compared to FFS would provide evidence supporting the hypothesis that beneficiaries with lower levels of educational attainment had more negative experience with care after controlling for socio-demographic and health characteristics (Hypothesis 2.1). Similarly, a statistically significant positive coefficient associated with White race in both MA a nd FFS would provide evidence 37 supporting Hypothesis 2.2, that Whites were more likely to report positive experience . A significant negative coefficient on the age variable for MA compared to FFS will indicate evidence for the hypothesis that beneficiarie s in MA who are 75 and older are likely to have a negati ve experience with obtaining care compared to thos e in FFS (Hypothesis 2.3). A significant negative coefficient for female gender in MA and FFS groups combined would provide evidence of a negative ex perience for females compared to males across both types of insurance . A significant negative coefficient for females in MA as compared to FFS would provide evidence of a more negative experience for females in MA as compared to females in FFS (H ypothesis 2.4). Results of these analyses will provide the basis for addressing Aim 2 . Evaluation of Aim 3 : A multivaria ble logistic regression model is used to examine Aim 3 and the outcomes report for Part D medication insurance coverage among th ose enrolled in M A-PD or FFS -PD. The analytic model is: Logit [ (Part D Experience = 1 |0)] = 0 + 1X1 i + 2X2 i ...+... kXk i The dichotomous dependent variable is the beneficiary's reported experience with a Part D insurance plan. The coefficients in this model can be interpreted as being the change in the log -odds between beneficiaries reporting positive experience with their Part D plan versus more negative experiences, conditioned on all the covariates in the model. A statistically negative coefficient for age younger than 65 in both MA and FFS ; and a lso for those younger than 65 for MA-PD compared to stand alone PDPs provides evidence 38 that younger beneficiaries had a more negative experience with obtaining medications than those over age 65 (Hypothesis 3.1). Similarly a statistically significant positive coefficient for White in both MA-PD and FFS -PD provide s evidence that Whites as compared to non -Whites reported a more positive experience with obtaining prescription s in the two insurance options (Hypothesis 3.2). A statistically negative coefficien t for graduating from high school or less as compared to more than a high school education would provide evidence that lower levels of educational attainment is associated with more negative experience s in obtaining prescripti on (Hypothesis 3.3). Results of these analyses address the hypot heses in Aim 3. 2.6 Confounding Multivaria ble models may include independent variables that are confounders, correlated with the dependent variable and one or more independent variables. The presence of a confounding variable will cause the coefficien t of the correlated independent variable to change, possibly losing statistical significance. A systematic analysis of potential confounding was completed for the multivaria ble logistic models and the results a re in Appendix B. The effects of confounding are discussed with the results of the logistic model analyses. 39 Chapter 3. Specific Results Aim 1 Aim 1 examines differences in MA and FFS diabetic patient characteristics including age, gender, race, education, region of residence, self -reporte d health st atus, dual eligibility, disability, comorbidity, and proxy assistance. Differences in proportion of diabetic beneficiaries responding to the four experiences of care questions, the dependent variables, are examined. Aim 1 consists of two hypo theses. Hyp othesis 1.1 states that a higher proportion of MA enrollees as compared to FFS with diabetes will be younger, male, lower educational attainment, non -whites and living in urban areas. It is also hypothesized that a higher proportion of FFS enro llees will be disabled, dual ly eligible for both Medicare and Medicaid, and have used proxy help to respond to the survey. The second hypothesis of Aim 1 (Hypothesis 1.2) states that a higher proportion of MA enrollees as compared to FFS with diabetes repo rted that their personal doctor explained things in a way that was easy to understand; had easy access to tests or treatment; or was easy to fill a prescription. It is hypothesized that a higher proportion of FFS enrollees report ed more ease with gettin g an appointment to see a specialist as compared to MA enrollees. Anal ysis of Hypothesis 1.1 - A higher proportion of MA enrollees as compared to FFS with diabetes will be younger, male, lower educational attainment, non -white and living in urban areas. Howev er, a higher proportion of FFS enrollees will be disabled, dually eligible for both Medicare and Medicaid, and use proxy help to respond to the survey. 3.1 Age 40 Table 3.1 shows CMS' ten age categories and corresponding frequency for the diabetic populatio n in the sample; Table 3.2 shows the distribution of the sample by CMS' age category and by insurance type. For purposes of this analysis, age will be grouped into three categories (Table 3.3): < 65 years, 65 -74, and 75 years and older. Previous research has indicated that Medicare beneficiaries younger than 65 years old seem to have different experiences with Medicare as compared to age 75 and above Medicare beneficiaries. These differences may vary by enrollment group, MA and FFS, and by age . In Tables 3.1, 3.2, and 3.3, enrollment group is compared by age distribution.

For this project, age groups are collapsed into three categories as shown in Table 3.3 below, un der age 65, age 65 -74, and 75 years and older. Please note that in the dataset, there are 2601 missing values for age (2.6%) due to beneficiaries who did not indicate their age group. Table 3.3: Distribution of Diabetic Enrollees by Age Category and Type of Insurance Age 3 Categories MA FFS -square value tests whether age group an d insurance type (MA vs. FFS) are independent (Table 3.3). The p-value (<0.001) is signi ficant due to a lower proportion of individuals less than 65 years of age in MA than FFS (47.08% vs 52.92%) and a higher proportion of those that are older (65 and abov e) in MA than FFS. This means that enrollment in either MA or FFS is associated with age. In our dataset, we have 2601 missing values for age (2.6%) due to beneficiaries who did not indicate their age group. It is important to note that the w hen looking at the distribution of missing values, both MA and FFS have about the same percentage of m issing values for the age groups. 18-64 Years Old Table 3.3 (Age Groups vs. MA_FFS) shows that people who are in the age group 18 -64 are more likely to be enrolled in an FFS insurance plan (18.8% vs. 14.2% in MA). The rationale for looking at beneficiarie s in this age group is important. Beneficiaries in this age group are generally ones that have qualified for Medicare due to disability and many are dually eligible for Medicare and Medicaid due to low incomes. In fact, in this diabetic sample, out of the people who are younger than 65 (n=15,228), 97.26% are disabled and 46.18% are duals. 65-74 Years Old 43 Table 3.3 (Age Groups vs. MA_FFS) shows that people who are in the age group 65 -74 are more likely to be enrolled in an MA insurance plan (47.1% vs. 44.28 % in FFS). 75 Years and Older Table 3. 3 (Age Groups vs. MA_FFS) also shows that people who are in the age group 75 and older are more likely to be enrolled in an MA insurance plan (38.7% vs. 36.1% in FFS). Previous studies have found that elderly Medicar e adults (those 65 and above) do not value having a large number of choices as highly as do younger adults and that elderly beneficiaries' knowledge of their alternative insurance options or benefits in MA is poor [McWilliams et al, 2013]. Older adults ma y in fact appreciate the coordination of care offered by MA and have less concern about the restrictions in provider choice associated with MA plans. This may e xplain why they prefer enro llment in MA over FFS. Based on a two -sample proportion test, we can conclude that the proportion of individuals 75 and older is higher in MA subscribers (55.3% versus FFS subscribers); 44.7% p-value= <0.0001. 3.2 Gender Table 3.4 shows the frequency of males and females in the sample. There is a higher proportion of fem ales (55.8%) than males (44.2%) who have diabetes . Table 3.4: Distribution of Diabetic Enrollees by Gender *P-value= <0.001 Gender Frequency Percent Cum. Percent 43,653 44.22 100.00 Total 98,726 100.00 44 Table 3.5 shows the proportion of males and females enrolling in MA and FFS in the sample. Table 3.5: Frequency of Males and Females by Insurance Type *P-value= 0.39 Note: First line is frequencies; second line is row percentages; third line is column perc entages. When looking at the overall chi -square test of whether the distributions of gender and insurance type (MA vs. FFS) are independent, we can see that there is not a statistically significant difference in the distribution of gender by insurance typ es ( p= 0.39). In this sample, those enrolled in MA are 44.1 % male and 55.9% female. Similarly, of those enrolled in FFS , 44.4 % are male and 55.6% are female. The analysis above indicates that both males and females in the sample are equally likely to en roll in either MA or FFS (p -value .390). 3.3 Race Table 3.6 shows the distribution of racial category within the diabetic sample utilized in this project. Table 3.6 shows that the majority of enrollees are Whites (75.9%). Blacks, Asians, Hispanics, and Native Americans constitute a minority with 15.2%, 2.05%, 3.78%, and .43% respectively. Table 3.6: Distribution of Diabetic Enrollees by Racial Category Gender MA FFS Total shows the distribution of diabetic patients' enrollment by racial group between MA and FFS. Table 3.7: Distribution of Enroll ees by Racial Category and Insurance Type Race Categories Frequency Percent Cum. Percent Unknown 110 0.11 0.11 Native 428 0.43 100.00 Total 98,726 100.00 Race MA FFS Total Unknown 47 is frequencies; second line is row percentages; third line is column percentages. The chi-square test is statistically significant and the distribution of beneficiary enrollment in MA and FFS varies by race varies (p <0.0001). This may indicate that there are aspects of MA as compared to FFS that are more attractive to specific racial groups. However, it is important to recognize that the MA option is not available in all geographic areas of the U.S. while FFS is available nationally. Table 3.7 shows that FFS has a higher proportion of Whites (79.4%) versus 72.9% in MA; and 0.58% Nativ e Americans in FFS versus 0.31% in MA. Consistent with previous research, the table shows minority groups including Blacks, Asians, and Hispanics have a preferen ce for enrolling in MA over FFS. One reason may be that the lower out -of- pocket costs for mana ged care (compared to those in FFS) may be attractive among minorities who tend to have lower incomes. For example, Balsa et al. 2007, found that Hispanics in managed care were less likely to delay care for cost reasons, relative to Whites, than Hispanics in FFS. To further explore enrollment of the racial groups in MA and FFS, Native Americans and unknown races were excluded from the sample and the remaining enro llees were dichotomized into two groups. The reason for excluding both Native Americans and Unknowns from the sample is because each group constitutes less than .05% of the sample. These numbers are so small that including or excluding them does not provide any meaningful contributions in the analysis. The first group was defined as all Whites second group contained all non -Whites =0 (excluding Native Americans and unknowns). Table 3.8 Distribution of Enrollees by Insurance Type and Race: Whites vs. non - Whites Exclud ing Native Americans and Unknown Race *P-value= <0.001 Note : First line is frequencies; second line is row percentages; third line is column percentages. After excluding Native Americans and unknowns, Table 3.8 shows a greater preference among non -Whites as to enroll in MA (62%) versus Whites (52%). 3.4 Educa tion Table 3.9 shows the overall frequency distribution by CMS level of education. Table 3.9: Distribution of Diabetic Enrollee s by E ducatio nal L evel Education Categories Frequency Percent Cum. Percent 8th grade or less 13,810 14.80 14.80 Some high sch ool, did not graduate 14,965 16.03 30.83 High school graduate or GED 100.00 Total 93,337 100.00 For purpo ses of this analysis, the CMS' six groupings of education shown above will be condensed into four categories: high school education or less, some college education, MA FFS Total Non year degree, and more than four years of college. In our dataset, we have 5389 missing values for education group (5.45%) from enrollees that did not indicate their level of education. A closer inspection of these missing values by insurance type revealed that that 3,123 (57.95%) of the missing values are from MA enrollees and 2,226 (42.05) are FFS enrollees. Table 3.10: Distribution of Education al Level by Insurance Type *P-value= <0.001 Note: First line is frequencies; second line is row percentages; third line is column percentages. Table 3.10 shows the educational group s by insurance type. It can be seen that MA has a higher proport ion of enrollees with a high school education or less (66.7% in MA versus 62.3% in FFS). This may reflect the larger numbers of minorities in MA than FFS. Disparities in socioeconomic status were marked for both black and Hispanic populations, particularl y among rural residents. For example, more than half of rural blacks and Hispanics reported less than a high school education and are more likely to live below the federal poverty level th an were their urban counterpart [J.C Probst, et al, Education Categories MA FFS Total High school or less 33,764 26,576 ducation is positively correlated with income and minorities have been shown , on average , to have lower average levels of education and income than Whites , the lower out -of-pocket costs in managed care as compared to FFS may be very attractive to those wi th lower incomes. FFS and MA have similar proportions of enrollees with some college education (21.98% in FFS vs. 21.17% in MA) ; FFS has a slightly higher proportion of enrollees with a four - year degree (6.98% in FFS vs. 5.98% in MA) ; and a higher proport ion of enrollees with more than a four - year degree (8.77% in FFS vs. 6.21% in MA). In summary , enrollees with higher levels of education are significantly more likely to enroll in FFS than MA (P < 0.0001). 3.5 Region and Urban versus Rural Residence: CMS classifies Medicare beneficiary places of residence in the U.S. into one of ten regions: Region 1: Northeast (CT, ME, MA, NH, RI, VT) Region 2: North Mid -Atlantic (NJ, NY, PR, and VI) Region 3: Mid -Atlantic (DE, DC, MD, PA, VA, and WV) Region 4: South Atlantic (AL, FL, GA, KY, MS, NC, SC, and TN) Region 5: East Midwest (IL, IN, MI, MN, OH, and WI) Region 6: Southwest (AR, LA, NM, OK, TX) Region 7: Midwest (IA, KS, MO, and NE) Region 8: Mountain (CO, MT, ND, SD, UT, and WY) Region 9: Pacific (AZ, CA, HI, and NV) Region 10: Northwest (AK, ID, OR, WA) Table 3.11 shows the distribution of region (numbered from 1 to 10) by insurance type. Overall, there is a significant differences in the distribution of region between MA and FFS (p=0.0 00). Table 3.11: Distribution of Diabetic Enrollee s by CMS' Regional Classification and Insurance Type . Region MA FFS Total 1 2,457 2,152 4,609 50 *P-value= <0.001 Note: First line is frequencies; second line is row percentages; third line is column percentages. A goal of this project is to classify respondents not onl y by the CMS' region of residences outlined above, but also by urban versus rural residence as defined by the United States Census Bureau. Since the data set contains zip code for each respondent, each zip code was linked to the Census Bureau's zip code cl assification as primarily a rural or urban area. The Census Bureau rural/urban classification of zip is available for GREATDATA.COM. The US Census Bureau defines urban as an area with a population den sity exceeding 1,000 people per square mile. Rural is defined as an area with a population density less than 1,000 people per square mile. GREATDATA.COM uses these definitions and further subdivides urban into suburban (1,000 - 3,000 persons per square mil e), and urban (3,000 plus persons per square mile). The dataset also provides a population estimate for each zip code. Table 3.12 below shows the distribution of rural/suburban/urban classification by insurance type. There are missing values for 160 peop le with unmatched zip codes in the sample fo r which there were no matches in the GREATDATA database.

The distribution of enrollees by region and insurance type (MA vs. FFS) shows enrollees in FFS are more likely to reside in rural areas (43.8 %) as compared to MA (28.9%). Previous research has shown that MA plans have lower penetration in many rural areas Residential Classification MA FFS Total to low population density, small numbers of providers, and rural provider resistance to MA contracting [Gold M, 2009]. This may be one e xplanation for why there are lower levels of Medicare enrollment for MA plans in rural areas as compared to FFS. The table shows that MA enrollees to be more likely to reside in urban areas (S+U = 71.1%) compar ed to FFS enrollees (S+U = 56.2%). 3.6 Disa bility To qualify for Federal disability and for Social Security Disability Insurance ( SSDI ), a person must be unable to engage in \"substantial gainful activity\" because of a medically determined physical or mental i mpairment expected to last at least 12 m onths or until death. Some qualified due to chronic diseases often associated with aging, such as musculoskeletal system disease and circulatory problems, others qualified because of cancer and injuries. Individual s meeting disability criteria and are Me dicare eligible will receive Medicare benefits after a two year waiting period [SSA.gov]. In this sample of diabetic beneficiaries, about 18% (17,723) reported being disabled and about 15% (14,624) indicated they received proxy help (had another person ass ist them) to complete the survey. The analysis below explores differences in these and other patient characteristic among diabetic beneficiaries. Table 3.13 shows the proportion of beneficiaries in MA and FFS that are disabled. A total of 17, 723 benefici aries were flagged by CMS as being disabled in this sample. A higher proportion of enrollees with disability ( 51.5 %) are FFS as compared to 48.5 % in MA. It appears that enrollees with disability may prefer to enroll in FFS over MA. It should be noted th at of the 17,723 disabled beneficiaries in the sample, 15,228 (86%) are younger than 65, 2096 (12%) are in the age group 65 -74, 30 (.001%) are 75 and older, 53 and there are 369 (2%) disabled who did not indicate their age. Research shows that the disabled in MA and FFS share some aspects of experience of ca re [Beatty et al, 2001]. Previous studies have shown that disabled Medicare enrollees differ from other Medicare beneficiaries in several ways. Persons with di sability are more likely to have mental and physical impairments, multiple comorbid conditions or more serious health conditions and are more likely to be in Fee -for-Service Medicare [Nicholas, 2009; kff.org]. Also, past research has found that the disabled who are enrolled in MA were more likely to disenroll from MA as compared to those enrolled in MA who were not disable d [Nicholas, 2009]. In addition, disabled Medicare enrollees are more likely to be younger than 65 and to report lower health status as compared to nondisabled Medicare beneficiaries [ KFF.org] Table 3.13: Distribution of Disabled Diabetic Enrollee by Insurance Type *P-value= <0.001 Note: First line is frequencies; second line is row percentages; third line is column percentages. 3.7 Dual Eligibility Dual Eligible beneficiaries are individuals who are entitled to Medicare and are also eligible for some level of assistance from their state Medicaid program. Dual eligible Disabled MA FFS Total the sickest and poorest individuals covered by either Medicar e or Medicaid (kff.org). Dual eligible b eneficiaries have low -incomes , which is one of the criteria for qualifying for dual status (CMS.Gov, Medicare -Medicaid Coordination Office - Fact Sheet August 2011 ). In this diabetic sample of 98,726, 23.4% (n=23,150 ) are dual eligible. This percentage is s lightly higher than the number of duals in the general Medicare population of 20% cited by KFF and seen in the 2009 CAHPS data. The higher level of disability among beneficiaries with diabetes is likely related to t he disabling effects of diabetes, particu larly when not treated. Diabetes can lead to blindness, amputation, and death. Table s 3.14A and 3.14 B show the distributions of patients in MA and FFS that are dually eligible for both Medicare and Medicaid, by age. In this diabetic sample of 98,726, 23. 4% (n=23,150) are duals. Table 3.14A shows the duals in the 65 and older group of Medicare enrollees. We see from this table that 18% or 15,077 of Medicare enrollees age 65 and older (n=80,468) are duals. When looking at t his group of duals within the 65 and over age group, we can see that the majority, 56.8% (n= 8,566) are enrolled in MA and 43.2% (n=6,511) are in FFS. Research has shown that older Americans are less familiar and less apt to use information to navigate cov erage options {692 Greenwald, L.M. 2006; 420 Uhrig, J.D. 2006}. They are more likely to rely on managed care for care coordination. Perhaps this supports why older duals are more likely to enroll in MA than FFS. Table 3.14B shows the number of duals in Medicare enrollees under age 65. Fro m Table 3.14B, we see that 46.18% or 7,230 of Medicare enrollees below the age of 65 (n= 15,657) are duals. We can see that the majority of duals below the age of 65 are enrolled in FFS (55.6% n= 8,566) compared to MA (44.4% n=6,511). 55 Table 3.14A: Distrib ution of Dual Status for Diabetic Enrollees 65 Years and Older by Insurance Type Dual Status MA FFS Total second line is row percentages; third line is column percentages. Table 3.14B: Distribution of Dual Status for Enrollees Under Age 65 years by Insuran ce Type *P-value= <0.001 Note: First line is frequencies; second line is row percentages; third line is column percentages . 3.8 Proxy Response Table 3.15 shows the distribution of beneficiaries in MA and FFS who indicated \"yes\" to receiv ing help completing the survey. A total of 14, 624 ( 14.8 % ) beneficiaries reported that they received help completing the survey, 57,124 (57.9%) answered \"No\" to receiving proxy help, and 26,978 (27.3%) did not answer this question (missing). From Table 3.15, we can see that the proportion of enrollees needing proxy assistance is slightly higher in MA (53.4%) versus (46.6 %) in FFS and statistically significant . Dual Status MA FFS Total previously cited and Table 3.10 show that enrollees with lower levels of education were more likely to enroll in MA than FFS . It might be expected that this would be a factor contributing to higher number s of enrollees needing proxy assistance in MA than FFS. There are 26, 978 missing values from enrollees who did not indicate whether they received proxy help. Further analysis revealed that a majority 54.9% of these beneficiaries are enrolled in MA compared to 45.1% in FFS.

Analysis of Hypothesis 1.2 - A higher proportion of MA enrollees as compared to FFS with diabetes will report that their personal do ctor explains things in a way that was easy to understand; It was easy to get the care, tests or treatment you thought you needed ; It was easy to get a prescription filled through Medicare; and a higher proportion of FFS enrollees will report more ease wit h getting an appointment to see a specialist as compared to MA enrollees; Proxy Assistance in Survey MA FFS 57 To assess experience of care for the diabetic population enrolling in MA and FFS, this research exami nes responses to four questions in the 2009 Consumer Assessment of Healthcare Pr oviders and Systems survey. These questions are: \"In the last 6 months, how often did your personal doctor explain things in a way that was easy to understand? \" \"In the last 6 months, how often was it easy to get the care, tests or treatment you thought you needed through your plan? \" \"In the last 6 months, how often was it easy to get appointments with specialists? \" \"In the last 6 months, how often was it easy to use Medicare to get the medicines your doctor prescribed? \" Only persons who reported having used each of the four services in the previous six months were asked each experience of care question. The four response categories to each question were : Always , Usually , Sometimes , and Never . Differences in responses to the experience of care question s are examined (Hypothesis 1.2) between beneficiaries enrolled in MA and FFS plans. Outcome Question 1(Doctor's Explanation): In the last 6 months, how often did your personal doctor explain things in a way that was easy to understand? The outcome question \"In the last 6 months, how often did your personal doctor explain things in a way that was easy to understand?\" is preceded by two screener questions about having a personal physician and having seen a physician within the previous six months . The first s creener question asks \"A personal doctor is the one you would see if you need a check -up, want advice about a health problem, or get sick or hurt. Do you have a personal doctor? Figure 2 shows that 2,323 persons did not respond to this screener question, 4,397 answered \"no\", and 92,006 (Figure 3) answered \"yes\" to having 58 a personal doctor. Figure 3 shows that 81,430 reported they had one or more visits to their personal doctor in the previous six months by responding to the second screener question , \"In t he last 6 months, how many times did you visit your personal doctor to get care f or yourself ?\" A total of 82,060 answered the outcome question \"In the last 6 months, how often did your personal doctor explain things in a way that was easy to understand?\" Respondents to the outcome question included persons who had responded negatively or not at all to the screening questions. The following analysis of responses to the outcome question includes all 82,060 enrollees who responded to the question. Th e16, 666 enrollees who did not answer the outcome question include persons who were screened out due to not having a personal doctor or not having seen the doctor in the previous six months or having decided to skip this outcome question . Further analysis reveal ed that 9,669 of those who did not answer the outcome question were MA enrollees and the remaining 6,997 were FFS enrollees . 59 Figure 2: Response Pattern to Question about Having a Personal Doctor (N=98,726) 60 Figure 3: Response Pattern for Persons who Answered \"Yes\" to Having a Personal Doctor (N=92,006) Table 1 6 shows the distribution of responses to the question about doctors' explanation s Table 3.16 shows the distribution of responses to the question about doc tors' explanations . 61 Table 3.16: Distribution of Diabetic Enrollee 's Response s to Doctors E xplanation by Insurance Type *P-value= <0.001 Note: First line is frequencies; second line is row percentages; third line is column percentages. In the analysis the four response categories are combined into two categories: \"never\" and \"sometimes\" are compared to \"usually\" and . Table 3.17: Binary Distribution of Enrollee s' Response s for Doctor 's Explanation by Insurance Type *P-value= <0.001 Note: First line is frequencies; second line is row percentages; third line is column percentages. Ease of Understanding Doctor 's'Explanation MA FFS Total Never 491 333 824 chi -square test of whether the distributions of doctor's explanation (dichotomized) and insurance type (MA vs. FFS) are independent. We can see that enrollees in FFS are more likely to answer t hat their d octors \"always\" or \"usually\" explain things in a way that was easy to understand (94.10%) versus 93.25% in MA. Although this difference is statistically significant, the difference is small and unlikely to have programmatic importance. Outcome Question 2 : In the last 6 months, how often was it easy to get the care, tests or treatment you thought you needed through your plan? There is one screener questions that precedes the outcome question \" In the last 6 months, how often was it easy to get the care, te sts or treatment you thought you needed through your plan? \" The screener question asks \" In the last 6 months, did you try to get any kind of care, tests, or treatment through your plan?\" Figure 4 shows t hat 5683 persons are \"missing \" answers to the screen er question, 36,757 answered \"no\", and 56,286 answered \"yes\" to the screener question . Relatively few of those who answered \"no\" or were missing answers went on to answer the outcome question . Out of the 98,726 enrollees in the sample, 56,092 (56,286 -1033+116+723=56,286) answered the outcome question by indicating having received care through Medicare in the previous six months. Thus, 42,635 enrollees did not answer this question; possibly this was because they did not seek any kind of treatment within th e specified time, or because they just decided to skip the question. Further analysis revealed that 24,154 of those that did not answer this question were MA enrollees and the remaining 18,480 were FFS enrollees. 63 Figure 4: Response Pattern to Persons Question about Receiving Care, Tests, or Treatments in the Previous Six Months (N=98,726) 64 Table 3.18: Distribution of Diabetic Enrollees ' Response s to the Question of Obtaining Care, Tests, or Treatment by Insuranc e Type *P-value= <0.001 Note: First line is frequencies; second line is row percentages; third line is column pe rcentages. Table 3.19 shows the four answer choices dichotomized by combining \"never\" and \"sometimes\" versus \"usually\" and \"always\" for the two insurance type s. Table 3.19: Binary Response for Obtaining Care, Tests, or Treatment by Insurance Type *P-value= <0.001 Note: First line is frequencies; second line is row percentages; third line is column percentages. Ease of Obtaining Care , Tests , or Treatment MA FFS Total Never 747 Ease of Obtaining Care, Tests, or Treatment MA FFS Total Never or sometimes 2,925 1,866 4,791 looking at the chi -square test of whether the distributions of getting care (dichotomized) a nd insurance type (MA vs. FFS) are in dependent, we can see that enrollees in FFS are more likely to indicate having received care, tests or treatment in the previous six months if in Medicare FFS (92.95%) than in MA (90.13%) . This difference is small and, even though it is statistically signif icant, suggests limited programmatic importance. Question 3: In the last 6 months, how often was it easy to get appointments with specialists? There is on screener that precedes the outcome question , \"In the last 6 m onths, how often was it easy to get app ointments with specialists?\" The screener question asks \"In the last 6 months, did you try to make any appointment to see a specialist ?\" Figure 5 shows that 4935 persons are missing answers to this screener question, 42,196 answered \"no\", and 51,595 answered \"yes\" to the question. Relatively few of those who answered \"no\" or were \"missing \" went on to answering the outcome question . Out of the 98,726 enrollees in the sample, 5 1,515 (5291 + 45,508 +151+565 = 51,515) answered the outcome question by indicating having made an appointment to see a specialist in the previous six months. Thus, 4 7,212 enrollees did not answer this question; possibly this was because they did not try to make an appointment within the specified time, or because they just decid ed to skip the question. 66 Figure 5: Response Pattern to Persons Question About Seeing a Specialist In the Previous Six Months (N=98,726) 67 Table 3.20: Distribution of Diabetic Enrollees ' Response s to Ease of Getting a Specialist Appointment by Insurance Type. *P-value= <0.001 Note: First line is frequencies; second line is row percentages; third line is column percentages.

Ease of Obtaining a Specialist Appointment MA FFS Total Never 680 487 1,167 58.27 shows that a higher proportion of enrollee s in FFS (90.3%) than MA (88.7% ) report ease with getting an appointment with a specialist . The difference is statistically significant but small and unlikely to have programmatic importance Question 4: In the last 6 months, how often was it easy to use your health plan to get the medicines your doctor prescribed? The question of ease experienced among enrollees in obtaining prescription medicines was only asked of those who reported being enrolled in a Medicare Part D drug plan. Out of the 98,726 enroll ees in the sample, 70,342 indicated being enrolled in a Part D drug plan. These are enrollees in MA -PD and FFS -PD plans. Those enrollees in \"MA Only\" and \"FFS Only\" are excluded in this measure since they do not have a drug benefit through Medicare. It is likely that enrollees in \"MA Only\" and \"FFS Only\" plans have a private drug benefit (e.g., through a medi -gap policy or an MA plan covering medications ) but some enrollees may have no drug benefit. Table 3.22 shows the distribution of responses to ease of getting medications. Table 3.22: Distribution of Diabetic Enrollees' Responses to Ease of Obtaining Medications through Prescribed Part D Drug Plans by Insurance Type Obtaining Prescription Medications MA-PD FFS-PD is frequencies; second line is row percentages; third line is column percentages. Table 3.23 shows responses the dichotomized outcome, \"never\" and \"sometimes \" compared to \"usually\" and \"always\" for the two insurance types. Table 3.23: Distribution of Enrollees' R esponse s for Ease of Obtaining Prescription Medications by Insurance Type Ease of Obtaining Prescription Medic iations MA-PD frequencies; second line is row percentages; third line is column percentages. Enrollees in MA -PD are not significantly more likely than FFF -PD to indicate ease with using Medicare to get the medicines their doctor prescribed (91.1%) than FFS-PD (90.7%, p=0.137). 71 Chapter 4. Specific Results Aim 2 Specific Aim 2: Examine the relationship of age, race, gender, proxy status, disability, education, self -reported health status, region of residence, as well as co -morbidities and dual eligibility and how this varies between MA and FFS, among those who have received one or more services and responded to the patient -reported experience questions. Aim two has four hypotheses; each of these hypotheses will be examined below. Hypothesis 2.1: After controlling for beneficiary socio -demographics and health characteristics, beneficiaries in both MA and FFS who have a high school education or less will be found to have worse experience of care. In addition, those in MA with a high school edu cation or less will be found to have worse experience of care than those in FFS with a high school education or less. Analysis of Hypothesis 2.1includes a series of univariate analyses using logistic regressions to examine the relationship between an indep endent variable and each of the four outcome variables. Co-variates are then added to the regressions to examine the relationship of other socio -demographic health characteristics to the outcome variable. The analyses initially examine these relationship s for all MA and FFS enrollees combined and then separately for MA and FFS. Table 4.1 shows the relationship of education, high school or less as compared to education beyond high school, for each of the four outcome variables. Individuals with more than a high school education are 54.5% (p<.0001) more likely to answer \"usually 72 and always\" having a better experience with their doctor's explanations than those with a high school or less education. Similarly those with more than a high school education answ er more positively for ease of getting care, tests and treatments (7% more , p<.0001 ); ease of getting specialist appointments (8% more , p<.0001 ); and ease of getting prescribed medications (20% more , p<.0001 ), than those with a high school education or less. The odds ratios are statistically significant across the four outcomes but the odds ratios for getting care and for spe cialty appointments are small and may have little practical significance .

Table 4.2 shows the multivariable analysis for MA and FFS enrollees combined , after excluding Native Americans and 73 those of Unknown ethnic ity. The rationale for excluding these two groups was discussed in Aim 1. Table 4.2 shows those with more than a high school education are 18% more positive with describing the way their personal doctor explain things to them (p<0.001) than those with a high scho ol education or less. Those with more than a high school education are 15% less likely to report a positive experience with getting car e, tests, or treatment (p < 0.0001) and 11% less likely to report a positive experience with ease of getting specialist appointment (p=0.04). Those with more than a high school education are 2% less likely to report a negative experience with ease of getting prescription medications than those with a high school education or less, but this is not statistically signi ficant ( p=0.631).

They are 12% more likely to report a statis tically significant negative experience with ease of getting specialist appointment (p=0.029) . Those with more than a high school education do no statistically differ from high school g raduates of less in their odds of eas e in getting prescription medications.

Those with more than a high school education are 24% more likely to report positive experiences with the way their personal doctor explains things to them than those with a high school education or less (p<0.001). More than a high school education v ersus t hose with a high school education is not statistically different from high school or less for experiences with getting care, tests, or treatments (p=0.074). Those with more than a high school education are 7% les s likely to report a positive experience with ease of getting specialist appointments than those with a high school education or 75 less (p=0.022). We also see that those with more than a high school education are 3% less likely to report positive experience with ease of getting prescription medication s than those with a high school education or less; this was not statistically significant (p= 0.570).

The introduction of covariates in the multivariate models modifies the odds ratio f or education , an effect associated with the addition of covariates with one or more acting as confounding variables. Confounding occurs when covariat es are correlated with both the dependent variable and with the primary independent variable, in this case education. An analysis of potentially confounding variables follows in understanding what their doctor tells them , except in the MA Only analysis (Table 4.3). For the other outcome variables: (1) getting care, tests, or treatment; (2) ease with getting s pecialist appointment; and (3) ease with getting prescription medications, beneficiaries in both MA and FFS who have more than a high school education report a more positive experience for these outcome variables when no adjustments were made for demograph ic and health status variables (Table 4.1). When demographic and health status variables are included in the models, we see that those with more than a high school education are likely to report worse experiences with getting care, treatment, or tests and with ease of making appointment with specialist. The two groups do not differ statistically in their reported experience with ease of getting prescription drugs when demographic and health variables are taken into account. This is consis tent with previous research (Landon et al. 2004; Elliott et. al 2011) which found that more highly educated beneficiaries tend to report worse experiences with care as they are more critical of their experiences with healthcare than beneficiaries with less education; even t hough highly educated beneficiaries are likely to have better access to 78 care than their counterparts in both MA and FFS settings . The table below summarizes findings from Hypo thesis 2.1. 4.8: Summary Table for Hypothesis 2.1: Statistically significant coef ficients shown with and without adjustments for covariates (race, gender, age, general health status, region, comorbidity, proxy, dual status, and disability Education: More than high school (ref. high school or less) MA and FFS Unadjusted for Covariates MA and FFS adjusted for Covariates MA only adjusted for Covariates FFS only adjusted for Covariates Outcome : Doctor explanations 1.55 1.18 1.11 NS 1.24 Obtaining care, tests, or treatment 1.07 .85 .79 .89 NS Getting specialist appointment 1.09 .89 .88 .93 Obtaining prescription drugs 1.20 .98 NS 1.00 NS .97 NS Hypothesis 2 .2: Beneficiaries in FFS and MA with diabetes who are White will be more likely to report a positive experience with care than non -whites after controlling for socio -demographics and health characteristics . Table 4.9 of hypothesis 2.2 shows univariate analysis looking at the experiences of care between benef iciaries who are White versus non -white. Without controlling for any demographic or health characteris tics, the analysis shows that beneficiaries who are White are more likely to report a positive experience for all the outcome variables of this project. W e can see that beneficiaries who are White are 69% more likely to answer \"usually and always\" (better experience) with regards to their experience with their doctor's explanations than non -whites, who mostly answered \"never or sometimes\" (worse experience). We also see from Table 4.9 that those who are White also answer more positively for ease of getting care , tests and treatments (131% more); ease of 79 getting specialist appointments (94% more); and ease of getting prescribed medications (100% more).

Tabl e 4.10 shows the multivariable analysis for all enrol lees (MA and FFS combined) excluding Native Americans and Unknowns. We can see from Table 4.10 that after adjusting for demographic and health variables, Whites are 28% more positive with their experiences of the way their personal doctor explain things to them(p<0.0001) than non -whites; 72% more positive with their experiences of getting care, tests, or treatment (p<0.0001); 51% more positive with their experiences of ea se with getting specialist appointment 80 (p<0.0001); and 76% more positive with their exp eriences of ease with getting prescription medications (p<0.0001).

After excluding Native Americans and those of Unknown ethni city and controlling for education, race, gender, age, general health status, region, com orbidity, proxy, dual status, and disability; we see that Whites in FFS are still more likely to report positive experience for all the outcome variables. For example, they are: 22% more likely to report a positive experiences with the way their personal d octor explain things to them (p=0.0005); 64% more likely to report positively with getting care, tests, or treatment (p<0.0001); 49% more positive with their experiences of ease with getting specialist app ointment (p<0.0001); and 72% more likely to report a positive experiences with ease of getting prescription medications than non -whites (p<0.0001).

This is consistent with previous research (Elliott et. al 2011), which found that Hispanics and blacks 84 repor ted less positive evaluations in surveys of their experiences of care than Whites. The table below summarizes findings from Hypothesis 2.2. Table 4.16: Summary Table for Hypothesis 2.2: Statistically significant coefficients shown with and without adjustm ents for covariates (race, gender, age, general health status, region, comorbidity, proxy, dual status, and disability.

Table 4.17 shows univariate analysis of Hypothesis 2.3, which compares experiences of care between those 65 and older and those younger than 65 in both MA and FFS. Without controlling for any demographic of health characteristics, the analysis shows that beneficiaries who are 65 and older (regardless of insurance option) are more likely to report a positive experience for all the four outcome variables. We can see that beneficiaries who are 65 and older are 32% more likely to answer \"u sually and always\" 85 (better experience) with regards to their experience with their doctor's explanations than those younger than 65 (p<0.0001). We also see from Table 4.17 that those 65 and older are 118% more likely to answer positively for ease of gettin g care, tests and treatments (p<0.0001); and 86% more likely to be positive with ease of getting specialist appointments (p<0.0001); and 69 % more likely to report positive exper ience with getting prescribed medications (p<0.0001) than those younger than 65.

The analyses adjusts for demographic and health variables including education , race , gender, age, general health status, region, comorbidity, proxy , dual status, and disability. Table 4.18 shows the multivariable analysis for all enrollees (MA and FFS combined); excluding Native Americans and those of Unknown et hnicity. We 86 can see from Table 4.18 that after adjusting for demographic and health variables, those that are 65 and older are: 18% more likely to report positive experiences for the way their personal doctor explain things to them (p<0.0001); 86% more lik ely to report positive experiences with ease of getting care, tests, or treatment (p<0.0001); 61% more likely to report positive experiences ease with getting specialist appo intment (p<0.0001)); and are 61% more likely to report positive experiences with e ase of getting prescription medications (p<0.0001)) than those that are younger than 65.

The analysis excludes Native Americans and those of Unknowns ethnic ity and adjusts for education, race, gender, age, general health status, region, comorbidity, proxy, dual status, and disability. We find that those 65 and older in MA only plans do not statistically differ from those under age 65 in reporting their exper ience for the way their personal doctor explain things to them (p = 87 0.065). However, for the dependent variables: getting care, tests, or treatment; ; ease with getting specialist appointment; and ease with getting prescription medications, people that ar e 65 and older are 66%, 58%, and 49% more likely to report positive experience for each outcome, respectively (p<0.0001).

However, looking at results from Medicare beneficiaries w ho are 65 and older in MA compared to those 65 and older in FFS, we see that those that are 65 and older in FFS report slightly more positive experience than those in MA. For example, for ease with understanding what their doctor explain, those 65 and olde r in FFS report 29% more positive experience (p<0.0001) as compared to those 65 and older in MA (p=246) . For ease with getting care, tests, or treatment, those 65 and older in FFS are 52% more likely to report positive experiences than their counterparts i n MA (p<0.0001). For ease with getting specialist appointment, those 65 and older in FFS are 9% more likely to report positive experiences than their counterparts in MA. Lastly, those 65 and older in FFS are 20% more likely to report positive experience wi th ease of getting prescription medications than those 65 and older in MA.

The tables below show experience of care for the outcome variables broken down by three age groups: those younger than 65, those between the a ges of 65 and 74, and those that are 75 and older. Using the younger group as the referent group, results from the tables below show that in general, those between the ag es of 65 -74 and those that are 75 and older do not differ in their experiences of care for the way that their doctor explains things to them. For ease with getting care, treatment, or test; ease with getting appointments from specialists; and ease with get ting prescription medication; those that are 75 and older are significantly more likel y to be positive than those that are younger than 75. *Sub - Hypothesis 2.3: 3 Age Groups (Sub Analysis - excluding Native Americans and Unknowns ) Table 4.25: Sub -Hypoth esis: Unadjusted Odds Ratios for Each Outcome by Age Group (MA and FFS Combined) Variable Age Odds Ratio 95% Confidence interval P-value 92 Age Group: <65 , 1.49 <0.001 >=75 1.24 1.15, 1.34 <0.001 Obtaining care, tests, or treatment <65 1.0 - - 65-74 1.99 1.85, 2.13 <0.001 >=75 2.45 2.26, 2.65 <0.001 Getting specialist appointment - >=75 1.76 1.65, 1.89 <0.001 Table 4.26: Sub -Hypothesis: Odds Ratios for Each Outcome by Age Group ( MA and FFS Combined ) Adjusted for Demographic and Health Status Covariates - excluding Native A mericans and Unknowns Variable Age Odds Ratio 95% Confidence interval Age Group: <65 0.790 >=75 0.72, 1.18 0.513 or <65 1.0 - - 65-74 1.40 1.09, 1.78 0.007 93 >=75 1.74 1.34, 2.25 Getting specialist appointment <65 1.0 - - 65-74 1.60 1.25, 2.02 <0.001 >=75 1.76 1.37, 2.27 <0.001 Obtaining prescription drugs <65 1.0 - - 65-74 1.34 1.07, 1.67 0.01 >=75 1.52 1.19, 1.92 0.001 Table 4.27: Sub -Hypothesis: Odds Ratios for Each Outcome by Age Group (MA Only) Adjusted for Demographic and Health Status - excluding Native Americans and Unknowns) Variable Age Odds Ratio 95% Confidence interval P-value Age Group: <65 1.25 0.549 >=75 0.94 0.67, 1.31 0.717 Obtaining care, tests, or treatment <65 1.0 - - 65-74 1.45 1.05, 2.01 - 1.14, 2.14 >=75 1.72 1.23, 2.39 0.001 Obtaining prescription drugs - 0.96, 1.76 0.092 >=75 1.01, 1.91 0.046 94 Table 4 .28: Sub -Hypothesis: Odds Ratios for Each Outcome by Age Group ( FFS Only) Adjusted for Demographic and Health Status - excluding Native Americans and Unknowns) Variable Age Odds ratio 95% Confidence interval P-value Age Group: <65 1.48 0.832 >=75 0.87 0.60, 1.27 0.475 Obtaining care, tests, or treatment <65 1.0 - - 65-74 1.34 0.93, 1.95 0.121 >=75 1.77 1.19, 2.64 0.005 Getting specialist - - 65-74 1.71 1.17, 2.48 0.005 >=75 1.91 1.29, 2.83 0.001 Obtaining prescription drugs <65 1.0 - - 65-74 1.36 1.88 >=75 1.70 1.201, 2.416 0.003 Hypothesis 2.4: Beneficiaries who are females will be associated with less positive reports of experience with their overall care in both MA and F FS than males; females in FFS will report more positive experience with care than those in MA after adjusting for socio -demographics and health characteristics. 95 Table 4.29, Hypothesis 2.4, shows univariate analysis looking at the experiences of care betw een males and females in both MA and FFS. Without controlling for any demographic characteristics, the analysis shows that beneficiaries who are males are more likely to report a positive experience for all the outcome variables of this project except for ease with getting prescription medication. We can see that beneficiaries who are males are 6% more likely to answer \"usually and always\" (better experience) with regards to their experience with their doctor's explanations than females. We also see from Ta ble 4.29 that those who are males also answer more positively for ease of getting care , tests and treatments (1 0% more); and ease of getting specialist appointments (16% more).

The results show that even when Native Americans and Unknowns are added to the models, the results are very similar: males and fema les in MA and FFS do not differ statistically in their reported experiences with three of the outcome variables. Males are less likely to report positive experience with the ease with getting prescription medication.

The table below summarizes findings from Hypothesis 2.4.

This section explo res whether the outcome variables is confounded by any of the demographic and health covariates. In this section, education is categoriz ed as high school education or less versus more than a high sc hool education. Table 5.1 below shows the relationship of education with the outcome variable \"understanding doctor explanations\" with and without adjusting for each demographic and health indep endent variable. Without adjusting for demographic and health variables, enrollees who have more than a high school education are about 55% (OR=1.55, 95% CI: 1.45, 1.65, p<0.0001) more likely to report better experiences with ease of understanding what th eir personal doctor explains to them. When individual demographic and health covariates are included as independent varia bles the odds ratio for education may change. A substantial change in the estimated odds ratio may suggests confounding by the added v ariable. A confounding variable is one that is correlated with both the independent variable (education) and the dependen t variable (understanding doctor communication) , but not in the causal pathway between the two variables, thereby creating an alternati ve explanation for the source of variation in the dependent variable. We see from the summary tables of Hypothesis 2.1 (Appendix C), that the relationship between education and the outcomes of understanding the doctor's explanations does not appear to b e confounded by the covariates of race, gender, age, general health status, comorbidities, disability or residence. Therefore, when holding all other variables 102 constant and only looking at the individual effects of each of these variables (one at a time) on education and th e outcome doctor explanations, we see that these variables do not substantially change (confound) the relationship between education and the outcome of understanding the doctor 's explanations. In other words, even after adjusting for demographic and health covariates, enrollees with more than a high school education are consistently more likely to report better experience than those with a high school education or less. However, we see that the variables defined as proxy (whether or not they report \"yes\" to someone helpin g them complete the survey) and dual status do appear to have confounding effects. The odds ratio in the unadjusted model (1.55) is much higher than the odds ratio of the adjusted model (1.18). This shows that proxy stat us and dual status are alternative e xplanations to educational attainment for explaining patient - reported understanding of doctor explanations. Table 5.1: Adjusted Odds Ratios for the Outcome, Ease of Understanding Doctor's Explanation, by Level of Educ ation (MA and FFS Combined) Variable: Education Unadjusted Odds Ratio for Ease of Outcome in >HS versus HS 95% CI P-value Unadjusted Education More than High School (HS) (Ref: High School (HS) or less 1.55 1.45 1.65 <0.0001 Adjusted for: Adjusted Odds Ratio for Ease of Outcome in >HS versus HS Race 1.49 1.40 1.59 <0.0001 103 White (Ref: Nonwhite) Race Excluding Unknowns and Native Americans) White (Ref: Nonwhite) 1.48 1.39 1.58 <0.0001 Gender Male (Ref: Female) 1.54 1.44 1.64 <0.0001 Age (65 and older (ref: less than 65) 1.54 1.43 1.64 <0.0001 General Health Status Category (ghs) (Ref: Excellent) 1.45 1.35 1.54 <0.0001 Comorbidities (4 groups = 0.1.2.3 or more) (Ref: 0 Comorbidities) 1.55 1.45 1.65 <0.0001 Proxy (Ref: No Proxy Help) 1.29 1.19 1.39 <0.0001 Dual status (Ref: Not Dual Status) 1.42 1.33 1.52 <0.0001 Disabled (Ref: Not Disabled) 1.55 1.45 1.65 <0.0001 Rural Category (Ref: Rural Area) 1.57 1.48 1.68 <0.0001 Fully Adjusted Model (adjusted for all variables; excluding unknown s and Native Americans) 1.18 1.09 1.28 <0.0001 Fully Adjusted Model (adjusted for all variables; including unknowns 1.18 1.08 1.28 <0.0001 104 and Native Americans) Table 5.2 below shows the relationship between education and the outcome variable of \"obtaining c are, tests, or treatment\" with and without adjusting for each demographic and health independent variable. Without adjusting for any demographic and health variables, enrollees that have more than a high school education are about 7% (OR=1.07 , 95% CI:1.01, 1.14, p<0,001) more likely to report better experiences with ease of getting care, tests, or treatment. We see from Table 5.2 that the relationship between one's education and answering \"always\" or \"usually\" for the outcome variable (Obtain ing care, tests, or treatment) is not confounded by the covariates of gender, age, comorbidities, and disability. Therefore, when holding all other variables constant and only looking at the individual effects of each of these variables (one at a time) o n education and the outcome \"obtaining care, tests, or treatment\", we see that these variables do not substantially change the relationship between education and the outcome. In other words, even after adjusting for demographic and health covariates, enrol lees with more t han a high school education are consistently more likely to report better experience than those with a high school education or less. We see that the variables race, proxy, residence, dual status, and general health status do appear to hav e confounding ef fects on this relationship. Again we see that before controlling for any demographic variables, the unadjusted model shows that those with more than a high school education are about 7% mor e likely to report better experiences with ease of getting care, tests, or treatment. After adjusting, the odds ratio decreases to 105 0.85 (95% CI: 0.78, 0.92, p<.001). This shows that race, proxy, residence, dual status, and general health status are alternative explanations to educational attainment for explaining patient -reported ease of obtaining care, tests, or treatment, so that when taken into account, those with more than a high school education are actually 15% less likely to report bet ter experiences with ease of getting care, tests, or treatment tha n those with a high school education or less.

The table shows that without adjusting for any demographic and health variables, enrollees that have more than a high school education are about 9% (OR=1.09, CI: 1.03, 1.16, p=0.004) more likely to re port better experiences with ease of getting appointment from specialists. Table 5.3 shows that the relationship between one's education and answering \"always\" or \"usually\" (better experience) for the outcome variable (getting specialist appointment) does not app ear to be confounded by the covariates of age, comorbidities, and disability. Therefore, when holding all other variables constant and only looking at the individual effects of each of these variables 107 (one at a time) on education and the outcome \"g etting specialist appointment\", we see that these variables do not substantially change the relationship between education and the outcome . Thus, individuals with more than a high school education are still more likely to report better experience than thos e with a high school education or less even after adjustment, We see that the variables of race, gender, proxy, residence, dual status, and general health status do appear to have confounding effects on this relationship. After adjusting, the odds r atio f or ease of getting an appointment from a specialist by education decreases to 0.89. This shows that race, gender, proxy, residence, dual status, and general health status are alternative explanations to educational attainment for explaining patient - report ed ease of getting specialist appointment, so that when taken into account, those with more than a high school education are actually 11% (OR=0.89, 95% CI: 0.83, 0.97, p=.004) less likely to report better experiences with ease of gettin g appointment from s pecialists than those with a high school or less education.

Table 5.4 shows that the relationship between one's ed ucation and the outcome of \" answering \"always\" or \"usually\" (better experience) for the outcome variable (obtaining prescription drugs .\") does not appear to be confounded by the covariates of gender, age, comorbidities, disability and residence. Therefore, when holding all other variables constant and only looking at the individual effects of each of these variables (one at a time) on education and the outcome obtaining prescription drugs, we see that these variables do not substantially confound the relati onsh ip between education and the outcome obtaining prescription drugs. From the Table 5.4 below, we see that the variables race, proxy, dual status, and general health status do appear to have confounding effects on this relationship. This shows that variables of race, proxy, dual status, and general health status are alternative explanations to educational attainment for explaining patient -reported ease of obtaining prescription drugs so that when taken into account, those with more than a high school edu cation are 2% less likely to report a negative experience with ease of getting prescription medications than those with a high school education or less, but this was not statistically significant (OR=0.98, 95% CI: .91, 1.06, p=0.611).

We can see from the table that in general, the variables of ra ce, general health status, proxy, dual status, and residency are found to be common confounders on the relationship between education and the four outcome variables. These confounding variables appear to have contributed to the differences between the unad justed odds ratio and adjusted odds ratio for each of the outcome variables. Hypothesis 2.1 The second part of hypothesis 2.1 of the confounding section hypothesized that those in MA with a high school education or less will report worst experience than t hose in FFS with a high school education or less. Table 5.5 below shows the relationship of insurance type (for only those with a high school education or less) on the outcome variable \"doctor's explanation\" with and without adjusting for each of the demo graphic and health independent variables. Without adjusting, we can see that enrollees in MA are about 11% (OR=1.11, 95% CI: 1.03, 1.19, p=0.004) more likely to report better experiences with ease of understanding what their personal doctor explain to the m than those in FFS. 112 We see from Table 5.5 that the relationship between insurance type and answering \"always\" or \"usually\" (better experience) for the outcome variable (doctor's explanation) does not appear to be confounded by gender, comorbidities, and disability. Therefore, when holding all other variables constant and only looking at the individual effects of each of these variables (one at a time) on insurance type and the outcome doctor explanations, we see that these variables do not substantially change the relationship of insurance type to the outcome of doctor's explanations. However, we see that the variables race, age, general health status, proxy, dual status, and residence do have confounding effects on this relationship as evidenced by the ir individual influences on the odds ratios. This shows that race, age, general health status, proxy, dual status, and residence are alternative explanations to insurance type for explaining patient -reported understanding of doctor explanations. We see tha t adjusting for demographic and health covariates, enrollees in MA are 7% (OR=1.07, 95% CI: 0.98, 1.17, p=0.12) more likely to report better experience than those in FFS; however, this was not statistically significant (p= 0.12).

We see from Table 5.6 that the relationship between insurance type and answering \"always\" or \"usually\" (better experience) for the outcome variable (obtaining care, tests, or treatment) does appear to be confounded by general health status an d residency. This shows that general health status and residence are alternative explanations to educational attainment for explaining patient -reported ease of \"obtaining care, tests, or treatment, \" so that when taken into consideration, those in MA are 33 % (OR=1.33, 95% CI: 1.20, 1.47, p<0.001) more likely to report better experiences with ease of getting care, tests, or treatment as compare to those in FFS.

We can see that without adjusting for any demo graphic variables, enrollees in MA with a high school education or less are about 18% (OR=1.18, 95% CI: 1.09, 1.27, p<0.001) 116 more likely to report better experiences with ease of getting appointments from specialist than those FFS . We see from Table 5.7 that the relationship between insurance type and answering \"always\" or \"usually\" (better experience) for the outcome variable (getting specialist appointment) does appear to be confounded by race, gener al health status, disability, dual status, and reside ncy. This shows that race, general health status, disability, dual status, and residency are alternative explanations to educational attainment for explaining patient -reported ease of getting specialist appointment so that when taken into consideration, th ose in MA are 14% (OR=1.14, 95% CI: 1.04, 1.26, P=.007) more likely to report better experiences with ease of getting appointments from specialist compare to those in FFS.

Without adjusting for any demographic and health variables, enrollees in MA do not differ statistically in their experiences with ease of getting prescriptions drugs when compared to enrollees in FFS (OR=1.00, 95% CI: 0.94, 1.07, p=.916). 118 We see from Table 5.8 that the relationship between insurance type and answering \"always\" or \"usually\" (better experience) for the outcome variable (getting prescriptions drugs) does appe ar to be confounded by race, age, general health status, proxy, disability, dual status, and residency. This shows that race, age, general health status, disability, dual status, proxy, and residency are alternative explanations to educational attainment f or explaining patient -reported ease of getting prescription drugs, so that when taken into consideration, those in MA 11% (OR=0.89, 95% CI: 0.81, 0.97, p=.010) less likely to report better experiences with ease of getting prescriptions drugs when compared to enrollees in FFS.

We can see from the table that in general, the variables of race, age, general health status, proxy, dual status, disability, and residency are found to be common confounders on the relationship between those in MA with a high school education or less and those in FFS with a high school e ducation or less and the four outcome variables. These confounding variables 120 contributed to the differences between the unadjusted odds ratio and adjusted odds ratio for each of the outcome variables. Hypothesis 2.2 In this section, the project explored t he relationship of race to beneficiary experience of care with and without adjusting for demographic and health characteristics. Table shows the relationship of race ( White vs nonwhite) with the outcome variable \"understanding doctor explanations\" with an d without adjusting for each demographic and health independent variable. Table 5.9 shows that without adjusting for demographic and health variables, enrollees who are White are 68% (OR=1.68, 95% CI: 1.58, 1.78) p<0.0001) more likely to report better expe riences with ease of understanding what their personal doctor explains to them than those that are non -whites. After adjusting for demographic and health variables, we see that enrollees who are White are 26% (OR=1.26, 95% CI:1.16, 1.38, p<0.0001) more li kely to report better experiences with ease of understanding what their personal doctor explains to them than non -whites. We see from Table 5.9 that the relationship between being White and answering \"always\" or \"usually\" (better experience) for the outcom e variable (doctors explanation) does not appear to be confounded by education, gender, age, general health status, comorbidities, disability and residence. Therefore, when holding all other variable s constant and only looking at the individual effects of each of these variables (one at a time) on race and the outcome of doctor 's explanation, we see that these variables do not substantially change the relationship of race to the outcome of doctor's explanations. 121 However, we see that the variables of proxy (whether or not they have someone helping them complete the survey) and dual status do appear to have confounding effects on this relationship since the odds ratio in the unadj usted model (1.68) is much higher than the odds ratio of the adjusted model (1.2 6). This shows that proxy status and dual status are alternative explanations to race for explaining patient -reported understanding of doctor's explanati ons.

Table 5.10 shows that without adjusting for demographic an d health variables, White enrollees are 132% (OR=2.32, 95% CI: 2.18, 2.37, p<0.001) more likely to report better experiences with ease of getting care, tests, or treatments than non -white enrollees. After adjusting for demographic and health variables, we see that White enrollees are 74% (OR=1.74, 95% CI: 1.59, 1.89, p<0.001) more likely to report better experiences with ease of getting care, tests, or treatment s than non-white enrollees. We see from Table 5.10 that the relationship between being White and answering \"always\" or \"usually\" (better experience) for the outcome variable (getting care, tests, or treatments) does not appear to be confounded by any of the demographic and health covariates. Therefore, when holding all other variables constant and onl y looking at the individual effects of each of these variables (one at a time) on 123 race and the outcome, we see that these variables do not substantially change the relationship of race to the outcome \"getting care, tests, or treatments.\" Table 5.10: Adjus ted Odds Ratios for Ease of Outcome by Race (MA and FFS Combined ) - Outcome: Getting Care, Tests, and Treatments Variable: Race Unadjusted Odds Ratio for Ease of Outcome in Whites versus Non White 95% CI P-value Unadjusted Race White (Ref: Nonwhite ) 2.32 2.18 2.47 <0.001 Adjusted for: Adjusted Odds Ratio for Ease of Outcome in Whites versus Non White Education More than High School (HS) (Ref: High School (HS) or less) 2.29 2.15 2.45 <0.0001 Gender Male (Ref: Female) 2.32 2.17 2.47 <0.0001 Age (65 and older (ref: less than 65) 2.18 2.04 2.33 <0.0001 General Health Status Category (ghs) (Ref: Excellent) 2.25 2.11 2.40 <0.0001 Comorbidities 2.34 2.20 Disabled) Category (Ref: Rural Area) 2.21 1.03 1.17 0.003 124 Dual status (Ref: Not Dual Status) 2.05 1.01 1.14 0.030 Fully Adj usted Model (not excluding Native Americans and Unknowns) 1.74 1.59 1.89 <0.001 Table 5.11 looks at the effects of race ( White vs nonwhite) on the outcome variable of \"getting specialist appointments\" with and without adjusting for any demographic and health variables. Without adjusting, White enrollees are about 94% (OR=1.94, 95% CI: 1.82, 20.6, p<0.001) more likely to report better experiences with e ase of getting appointments from specialist than non -whites. After adjusting for demographic and health variables, we see that White enrollees are 51% (OR=1.51, 95% CI: 1.38 , 1.64, p<0.001) more likely to report better experiences with ease of getting appointments from specialists than non -white enrollees. We see from Table 5.11 that the relationship bet ween being White and answering \"always\" or \"usually\" (better experience) for the outcome variable (getting specialist appointment) is not confounded by education, gender, age, general health status, comorbidities, proxy, disability and residence. However , we see that the variable of dual status does appear to have a confounding effect on this relationship. This shows that dual status has an alternative explan ation to race for explaining patient -reported ease of getting a specialist appointment.

Without adjusting for dem ographic and health variables, White enrollees are about 101% (OR=2.01, 95% CI: 1.91, 2.12, p<0.0001) more li kely to report better experiences with ease of getting prescription medications than non -whites. After adjusting for demographic and health variable s, we see that White enrollees are 75% (OR=1.72, 95% CI: 1.62, 1.89, p<0.0001) more likely to report better experiences with ease of getting prescription drugs than enrollees that are non -whites. From Table 5.12, we see that the relationship between being White and answering \"always\" or \"usually\" (better experience) for the outcome variable (getting prescriptio n drugs) does not appear to be confounded by any of the demographic and health variables.

We can see from the table that the variables of proxy and dual status are found to be confounders on the relationship between race and some of the four outcome variables. These confounding var iables contributed to the differences between the unadjusted odds ratio and adjusted odds ratio for each of the outcome variables. Hypothesis 2.3 128 This section explored the relationship of age to beneficiary experience of care with and without adjusting f or demographic and health characteristics. In section I, we looked at whether enrollees in MA and FFS who are 65 and older are more likely to report a positive experience with obtaining car e than enrollees in MA and FFS who are younger than 65 after adjust ing for socio -demographics and health characteristics. In this section, the project will look at whether the demographic and health variables have a confounding effect on the relationshi p between age (65 or older versus younger than 65) and experience o f care among enrollees .Without adjusting for demographic and health variables, enrollees that are 65 and older in both MA and FFS are 32% (OR=1.32, 95% CI: 1.23, 1.41, p<0.0001) more likely to report better experiences with ease of understanding what thei r personal doctor explains to them than enrollees who are younger than 65 in both MA and FFS. When individual demographic and health covariates are introduced as independent variables the o dds ratio for age may change. After adjusting for individual de mographic and health covariates, we see that those who are 65 and older in both settings are 5% (OR=0.95, 95% CI: 0.75, 1.20, p=0.64) less likely to report better experiences with ease of doctor's explanation compared to those who are less than 65 in both settings although not statistically significant (p=0.64). We see from Table 5.13 that the relationship between being 65 and older and answer ing \"always\" or \"usually\" (better experience) for the outcome variable (doctors explanation) for both MA and FFS doe s not appear to be confounded by education, gender, comorbidities, and residence. Therefore, when looking at the individual effects of each of these variables (one at a time) on the relationship between age and the outcome of 129 doctor's explanation, we see that these variables do not substantially change the relationship of age to the outcome of doctor's explanations. However, we see that the variables of race, general health status, disability, and proxy (whether or not they have someone helping them compl ete the survey) and dual status do have confounding effects on this relationship. This shows that proxy status, dual status, disability, rac e, general health status are alternative explanations to age for explaining patient -reported understanding of doctor explanations.

Without adjusting for demographic and health variables, enrollees who are 65 and older in both MA and FFS are 117% (OR=2.17, 95% CI: 2.03, 2.32, p<0.001) more likely to report better experiences with ease of gettin g care, tests, or treatment than enrollees who are younger than 65 in both MA and FFS.

From Table 5.14, we see that the relationship between age and answering \"always\" or \"usually\" (better experienc e) for the outcome variable (getting care, tests,or treatments) for both MA and FFS enrollees does not appear to be confounded by race, education, gender, proxy, comorbidities, and residence. Therefore, when looking at the individual effects of each of th ese variables (one at a time) on age and the outcome of getting care, tests, or treatment, we see that these variables do not subs tantially change the relationship of race to the outcome of getting care, tests, or treatment. However, we see that the variab les general health status, disability, and dual statu s do have confounding effects on this relationship. This shows that dual status, disability, general health status have a confounding effect on the relationship between age and the outcome getting care, tests, or treatment and are alternative explanations to age for explaining patient -reported ease of getting care, tests, or treatments.

We can see from the table that the variables of proxy , dual status , general health st atus, and disability are found to be confounders on the relationship between age (<65 and 65+) and the four outcome variables. These confounding variables contributed to the differences between the unadjusted odds ratio and adjusted odds ratio for each of the outcome variables. Hypothesis 2.3 -Sub-Analysis: Analysis looking at experiences of care for ages 75 and older versus younger than 75 138 A sub analysis to Hypothesis 2.3 also looked at experience s of care between those that are 75 years and older compared to those that are younger than 75 in both MA and FFS unadjusted and after adjusting for education, race, gend er, age, general health status, region, comorbidity, proxy, dual status, and disabil ity. This sub analysis explored whether any of the demographic independent and health variables have a confounding effect on the relationship between age (being 75 and older or younger than 75) and experience with care. Table 5.17 looks at the relationship of being 75 and older and answering \"always\" or \"usually\" (better experience) for the outcome variable of (doctor's explanation). Without adjusting for demographic and healt h variables, enrollees that are 75 and older in both MA and FFS are 2% less likely to report better experiences with understanding doctors explanation than enrollees who are younger than 75 in both MA and FFS; however, this relationship is not significant (OR= 0.98, 95% CI: 0.93, 1.04, p<0.591). After adjusting for individual demograph ic and health covariates, we see that those who are 75 and older in both settings are 4% less likely to report better experiences with understanding doctor's explanation comp ared to those who are less than 75 in both settings. Again, this relationship is n ot significant (OR=0.96, 95% CI:0.88, 1.04, p=0.35). In Table 5.17 below, we see that the relationship b etween being 75 and older and answering \"always\" or \"usually\" (better experience) for the outcome variable \"understanding doctor's explanation\" for both MA and FFS enrollees does not appear to be confounded by education , comorbidities, and residence. There fore, when looking at the individual effects of each of these variables (one at a time) on age and the outcome of 139 understanding doctor's explanation we see that these variables do not substantially change the relationship of age to the outcome. However, we see that the variables of gender , race, general health status, disability, proxy (whether or not they have someone helping them complete the survey) a nd dual status appear to confound this relationship. This shows that education, race, general health status, disability, proxy and dual status are alternative explanations to age for explaining patient -reported ease of understanding doctor's explanation. Table 5.17: Adjusted Odds Ratios for Ease Outcome by Age (75 and older vs. younger than 75) (MA and FFS Combined) - Outcome: Doctor's Explanation Variables: Age Unadjusted Odds Ratio for Ease of Outcome in 75 and older versus less than 75 95% CI P-value Unadjusted: Adjusted Odds Ratio for Ease of Outcome in 75 and older versus less than 75 Age 75 and older (ref: younger than 75) .98 .93 1.04 0.591 Adjusted For: Education 4 Cat More than High School (HS) (Ref: High School (HS) or less)) .99 .94 1.06 0.961 Race White (Ref: Nonwhite) .96 .90 1.01 0.129 Race (Excluding Unknowns and Native Americans) White (Ref: Nonwhite) .96 .90 1.01 0.130 140 Gender Male (Ref: Female) .99 .93 1.05 0.664 General Health Status Category (ghs ) (Ref: Excellent) .95 .89 1.01 0.111 Comorbidities (4 groups = 0.1.2.3 or more) (Ref: 0 Comorbidities) .98 .93 1.04 0.599 Proxy (Ref: No Proxy Help) 1.06 .98 1.14 0.129 Dual status (Ref: Not Dual Status) .94 .88 .99 0.028 Disabled (Ref: Not Disabled) .89 .83 .94 <0.001 Rural Category (Ref: Rural Area) .99 .94 1.05 0.820 Fully Adjusted Model (adjusted for all variables; excluding unknowns and Native Americans) .96 .88 1.04 0.34 Fully Adjusted Model (adjusted for all variables; including unknowns and Native Americans) .96 .88 1.04 0.35 From Table 5.18, we see that the relationship being 75 and older and answering \"always\" or \"usually\" (better experience) for the outcome variable of \"obtaining care, tests, or treatmen t.\"). Without adjusting for demographic and health variables, enrollees that are 75 and older are 55% (OR=1.55, 95% CI: 1.45, 1.66, p<0.001) more likely to report better experiences with ease of getting specialist appointment than enro llees who are younger than 75, in both MA and FFS. After adjusting for individual demographic and 141 health covariates, we see that those who are 75 and older in both settings are 27% (OR=1.27, 95% CI< 1.16, 1.39,p<0.001) more likely to report better experien ces with ease of obta ining care, tests, or treatment compared to those who are less than 75 in both settings. In Table 5.18 below, we see that the relationship between being 75 and older and answering \"always\" or \"usually\" (better experience) for the outcome variable \"obtainin g care, tests, or treatment\" does not appear to be confounded by race, education, gender, proxy, comorbidities, dual status, general health status, and residence. Therefore, when only looking at the individual effects of each of these va riables (one at a time) on age categories and the outcome obtaining care, tests, or treatment, we see that these variables do not substantially change the relationship of age to the outcome of obtaining care, tests, or treatment. However, we see that the v ariable of disabil ity does have a confounding effect on this relationship. This shows that disability has an alternative explanation to age for explaining patient -reported ease of obtaining care, tests, or treatment.

Without adjusting for demographic and health variables, enrollees that are 75 and older are 37% (OR=1.37, 95% CI: 1.29, 1.45, p<0.001) more likely to report better experiences with ea se of getting specialist appo intment than enrollees who are younger than 75, in both MA and FFS. After adjusting for individual demographic and health covariates, we see that those who are 75 and older in both settings are 11% (OR= 1.11, 95% CI: 1.03, 1.21 , p<0.001) more likely to rep ort better experiences with ease of obtaining care, tests, or treatment compared to those who are less than 75 in both settings. In Table 5.19 below, we see that the relationship between being 75 and older and answering \"always\" o r \"usually\" (better experi ence) for the outcome variable \"getting specialist appointment\" for both MA and FFS enrollees does not appear to be confounded by race, education, gender, proxy, comorbidities, general health status, proxy, and residence. Therefor e, when holding all other variables constant and only looking at the individual effects of each of these variables (one at a time) on age and the outcome of getting a specialist appointment, we see that these variables do not substantially change the relat ionship of age to the outc ome. However, we see that the variables of dual status and disability do have confounding effects on this relationship. This shows that dual status and disability have alternative explanations to age for explaining patient -reported ease of obtaining care, tests, or treatment.

Without adjusting for demographic and health variables, enrollees that are 75 and older are 22% (OR=1.22, 95% CI: 1.16, 1.29, p<0.001) more likely to report better experiences with ease of obtaining prescription drugs than enrollees who are younger than 75, in both MA and FFS. After adjusting for individual demographic and health covariates, we see that those who are 75 and older in both settings are 15% (OR=1.15, 95% CI: 1.06, 1.25, p<0.001) more likely to report better experiences with ease of obtaining prescription medication compared to those wh o are less than 75 in both settings. In Table 5.20 below, we see that the relationship between being 75 and older and answering \"always\" or \"usually\" (better experience) for the outcome variable \"obtaining prescription drugs\" for both MA and FFS enrollees doe s not appear to be confounded by race, ge nder, comorbidities, dual status, and comorbidities.. Therefore, when only looking at the individual effects of each of these variables (one at a time) on age categories and the outcome of obtaining prescription dr ugs, we see that these variables do not su bstantially change the relationship of age to the outcome. However, we see that the 146 variables of disability, proxy, education, and residency do have confounding effects on this relationship. This shows that disabil ity, proxy, education, and residency have alternative explanation to age for explaining patient -reported ease of obtaining prescription drugs. Table 5.20: Adjusted Odds Ratios for Ease of Outcome by Age ( 75 and older vs. younger than 75) (MA and FFS Combined ) - Outcome: Obtaining Prescription Drugs Variables: Age Unadjusted Odds Ratio for Ease of Outcome in 75 and older versus less than 75 95% CI P-value Unadjusted: Age 75 and older (ref: younger than 75 (univariate) 1.22 1.16 1.29 <0.001 Adjusted For: Adjusted Odds Ratio for Ease of O utcome in 75 and older versus less than 75 Education 4 Cat More than High School (HS) (Ref: High School (HS) or less) 1.29 1.22 1.37 <0.001 Race White (Ref: Nonwhite) 1.22 1.16 1.29 <0.001 Race (Excluding Unknowns and Native Americans) White (Ref: Nonwhite) 1.22 1.16 1.30 <0.001 Gender Male (Ref: Female) 1.25 1.19 1.32 <0.001 General Health Status 1.22 1.16 1.29 <0.001 147 Category (ghs) (Ref: Excellent) Comorbidities (4 groups = 0.1.2.3 or more) (Ref: 0 Comorbidities) 1.26 1.19 1.33 <0.001 Proxy (Ref: No Proxy Help) 1.39 1.29 1.49 <0.001 Dual status (Ref: Not Dual Status) 1.22 .99 1.13 <0.001 Disabled (Ref: Not Disabled) 1.06 .99 1.13 0.07 Rural Category (Ref: Rural Area) 1.28 1.21 1.35 <0.001 Fully Adjusted Model (adjusted for all variables; including unknowns and Native Americans) 1.15 1.06 1.25 <0.001 Fully Adjusted Model (adjusted for all variables; excluding unknowns and Native Americans) 1.15 1.06 1.25 <0.001 The table s above summariz es the variables that are found to be confoun ders on the relationship age (<75 and 7 5+) and each of the dependent variables. We can see from the table that the variables of proxy, dual status, and disability are found to be confounders on the relationship between age (<75 and 7 5+) and the four outcome variables. These confounding variables contributed to the differences between the unadjusted odds ratio and adjusted odds ratio for each of the outcome variables. Hypothesis 2.4 148 In this section, the project e xplored the relationship of gender to beneficiary experience of care with and without adjusting for demographic and health characteristics. The purpose is to determine if the relationship of gender to experience with care is confounded by any of the demog raphic and health characteristics. Table 5.21 below shows the relationship of gender with the outcome variable \"understanding doctor explanations\" with and without adjusting for each demographic and health independent variable. Without adjusting for demog raphic and health variables, enrollees that are male are about 6% more likely to report better experiences with ease of understanding what their personal doctor explains to them than enrollees that are females in both MA and FFS; this relationship is not s tatistically significant (OR=1.06, 95% CI: 0.96, 1.08, p=0.542). We see from Table 5.21 that the relationship between one's gender and answering \"always\" or \"usually\" understanding the doctor's explanations does not appear to be confounded by the covari ates of age, and residence . Therefore, when only l ooking at the individual effects of each of these variables (one at a time) on gender and the outcome doctor explanations, we see that these variables do not substantially change the relationship of gender to the outcome of doctor's explanations. In other words, even after adjusting for demographic and health covariates, enrollees who are male do not appear to be more likely to report better experience than females, in both MA and FFS. However, we see that the variables of proxy (whether or not they report someone helping them complete the survey), race, education, comorbidities, proxy, dual status, disability, general health status do have confounding effects on this relationship. This shows that 149 proxy stat us, race, education, and general health status are alternative explanations to gender for explaining patient -reported understanding of doctor explanations.

Without adjusting for demographic and health variables, enrollees that ar e male are 9% (OR=1.09, 95% CI: 1.04, 1.17, p=0.002) more likel y to report better experiences with ease of obtaining care, tests, or treatment than females, in both MA and FFS. After adjusting for individual demographic and health covariates, we see that m ales in both settings are 1% less likely to report better exper iences with ease of obtaining care, tests, or treatment compared to females in both settings. However, this relationship is not statistically significant (OR=0.99, 95% CI: 0.91, 1.07, p=0.74). From Table 5.22 below, we see that the relationship between ge nder and answering \"always\" or \"usually\" (better experience) for the outcome variable \"obtaining care, tests, 151 or treatment\" for both MA and FFS enrollees does not appear to be confounded by comor bidities, residence, and proxy. Therefore, when only looking at the individual effects of each of these variables (one at a time) on gender categories and the outcome obtaining care, tests, or treatment, we see that these variables do not substantially cha nge the relationship of gender to the outcome of obtaining c are, tests, or treatment. However, we see that the variables of education, race, age, general health status, disability and dual status do have confou nding effects on this relationship.

After adjusting for individual demographic and health covariates, we see that males are 5% less likely to rep ort better experiences with ease of getting specialist appointment 153 as compared to females in both settings. However, this relationship is not statistically significant (OR=1.04, 95% CI:0.97, 1.12, p=0.25). From Table 5.23 below, we see that the relationship between gender and answering \"always\" or \"usually\" (better experience ) for the outcome variable of \"getting a specialist appointment\" does not appear to be confounded by age, disability, residence, proxy and education. Therefore, when only looking at the i ndividual effects of each of these variables (one at a time) on gend er and the outcome of getting specialist appointment, we see that these variables do not substantially change the relationship of gender to the outcome of getting a specialist appointment. However, we see that the variables of race, general health status, dual status and comorbidity do have confounding effects on this relationship.

After adjusting for individual demographic and health covariates, we see that males are 16% less likely to report better experiences with ease of obtaining prescription drugs compared to females in both settings (OR= 0.84, 95% C I: 0.78, 0.90, p<0.001). From Table 5.24 below, we see that the relationship between gender and answering \"always\" or \"usually\" (better experience) for the outcome variable \"obtaining prescription drugs\" for both MA and FFS enrollees is confounded by race, general health status, and dual status. . Therefore, when only looking at the individual effects of each of these variables (one at a time) on gender categories and the outcome obtaining prescription drugs, we see that these variables do substantially ch ange the relationship of gend er to the outcome obtaining prescription drugs.

We can see from the table that the 157 variables of dual status, general health status, education, and race are found to be confounders on the relationship between gender and the four outcome variables. These confounding variables contributed to the differences between the unadju sted odds ratio and adjusted odds ratio for each of the outcome variables. Hypothesis 2.4 Table 5.25 looks at whether females in FFS report better experiences of care than females in MA for the outcome variable of \"doctor's explanations\" unadjusted and af ter adjusting for each of the independent demographic and health variables. Without adjusting for any demographic and health variables, female enrollees in MA are 13% (OR=1.13, 95% CI: 1.05, 1.21, p=0.002) more likely to report better experiences with ease of doctors explanation than females in FFS. After adjusting for individual demographic and health covariates, we see that female enrollees in MA are 12% (OR=1.12, 95% CI: 1.01, 1.23, p=0.03) more likely to report better experiences with ease of doctors e xplanation than females in FFS. We see that the relationship between being female and answering \"always\" or \"usually\" (better experience) for the outcome variable (doctors explanation) does appear to be confounded by education, race, general health status, and residence. This shows that education, race, general health status, and residence are alternative explanations to gender for explaining patient -reported ease of understanding doctor's explanation. However, the relationship between being female and answ ering \"always\" or \"usually\" (better experience) for the outcome variable \"doctor's explanation\" is not confounded by age, proxy , dual status, disability, and comorbidities. Therefore, when only looking at the 158 individual effects of each of these variables ( one at a time) on females and the outcome of doctor 's explanation, we see that these variables do not substantially change the relationship between gender and the outcome of doctor's explanation.

Without adjusting for any demographic and health variables, female enrollees in MA are about 42% (OR=1.42, 95% CI: 1.31, 1.54, p<0.001) mor e likely to report better experiences with ease of obtaining care, tests, or treatment th an females in FFS. After adjusting for individual demographic and health covariates, we see that female enrollees in MA are 40% (OR=1.40, 95% CI: 1.26, 1.55, p<0.001) more likely to report better experiences with ease of obtaining care, tests or treatment. We see that the relationship between insurance type and answering \"always\" or \"usually\" (better experience) for the outcome variable of \"obtaining care, tests, or tr eatment\" among females is confounded by the variables of general health status, and resid ence. Therefore, when only looking at the individual effects of each of these variables (o ne at a 160 time) on insurance type and the outcome of obtaining care, tests, or treatment, we see that these variables do change the relationship of insurance type to th e outcome of obtaining care, tests, or treatment, among females.

Without adjusting for demographic and health variables, female enrollees in MA are 15% (OR=1.15, 95% CI: 1.07, 1.24, p<0.001) more likely to report better experiences with ease of getting specialist appointment than female enrollees in FFS. After adjusting for individual demographic and health covariates, we see that females in MA are 10% (OR=1.10, 95% CI: 0.99, 1.21, p=0.052) more likely to report better experiences with ease of getting a specialist appointment compared to females in FFS. Table 5.27 below, we see that the relationship between insurance type and answering \"always\" or \"usually\" (better experience) for the outcome variable \"getting specialist appointment\" is not confounded by education, age, comorbidities, and dual status. Therefore , when only looking at the individual effects of each of these variables (one at a 162 time) on insurance type and the outcome of getting a specialist appoint ment, among females, we see that these variables do not substantially change the relationship. However, we see that the variables of race, general health stat us, proxy, disability, and residence do have confounding effects on this relationship. This shows that race, general health status, proxy, disability, and residence are alternative explanations to insurance type for explaining patient -reported ease of getting specialist appointment among females.

Without adjusting for dem ographic and health variables, enrollees that are female in MA are 6% less likely to report better experiences with ease of obtaining prescription drugs than enrollees who are females in FFS; however, this relationship is statistically non -significant (OR= 0.94, 95% CI:0.88, 1.01, p= 0.080). After adjusting for individual demographic and health covariates, we see that females in MA are 12% (OR=0.88, 9 5% CI0.80, .097: p=0.01) less likely to report better experiences with ease of obtaining prescription drugs c ompared to females in FFS. 164 From Table 5.28 below, we see that the relationship between insurance type and answering \"always\" or \"usually\" (better experience) for the outcome variable of \"obtaining prescription drugs\", among females, is not confounded by e ducation and co - morbidities. Therefore, when only looking at the individual effects of each of these variables (one at a time) on gender categories an d the outcome of obtaining prescription drugs, we see that these variables do not substantially change the relationship of insurance type to the outcome of obtaining prescription drugs. However, we see that the variables of race, age, general health status , proxy, dual status, disability, and residence do have confounding effects on this relationship. This sho ws that race, age, general health status, proxy, dual status, disability, and residence are alternative explanations to insurance type for explaining patient -reported ease of obtaining prescription drugs.

We can see from the table that the variables of race, general health status , residence, disability, and proxy are 166 found to be confounders on the relationship between being female in MA vs FFS and the four outcome variables. These confounding variables contributed to the differences between the unadjusted odds ratio and adjusted o dds ratio for each of the outcome variables. 167 Chapter 6. Specific Results Aim 3 AIM 3: Examine the relationship of age, race, gender, education, self -reported health status, region of residence, co -morbidities, dual eligibility, and proxy assistance with survey on self -reported ease of filling a prescription, comparing the experience of enrollees in MA -PD and FFS -PD plans. Hypothesis 3.1: Older Medicare enrollees with diabetes are expected to be more positive about their experience in obtaining prescription medications and those enrolled in MA -PD plans are expected to be more positive than enrollees in FFS -PD after controlling for socio - demographics and health characteristics; age categories are under age 65, 65 -74, and 75 and over. Hypothesis 3.1 examines the relationship of enrollee age and insurance type to self - reported ease of obtaining prescription medications. Enrollees under age 65 and those 75 years old or more are compared to those ages 65 -74 years old. The numbers of e nrollees in MA -PD (N= 41,901) and FFS -PD plans (N=28,441) is smaller than the total enrollees in MA (N=53,785) and FFS (N=44,941) plans because for several reasons. Medicare enrollees may have comparable insurance coverage for medications through a Medi -gap policy, MA plans may include medications in their plan, and there are individuals with no insurance coverage for prescription drugs. 168 Table 6.1 shows the unadjusted odds ratio from the univariate model (without covariates) for ease with obtaining prescription medication for those that are 65 and older compared to those that are younger than 65. Without adjusting for any demographic variables, enrollees with the drug coverage who are 65 and older are about 70% more likely to report better experienc es with ease of obtaining medication compared to those that are younger than 65 (OR=1.70, 95% CI: 1.60, 1.70, p < 0.0001) and disabled in in the combined (MA and FFS) payment plans. The second panel in Table 6.1 examines the individual possible confoundin g influences of each covariate on the relationship between ease of obtaining prescription medication and age. We see from Table 6.1 that the relationship between age and answering \"always\" or \"usually\" (better experience) for ease of obtaining prescriptio n medication (outcome variable) is not substantially confounded by race, gender, education, comorbidities, proxy, and residence. Therefore, when only looking at the individual effects of each of these variables (one at a time) on the outcome (ease of obtai ning medication), we see that these variables do not have a major impact on the relationship between age and the outcome. However, we see that the variables of dual status, disability, and general health status do have confounding effects on this relation ship. We see that the unadjusted odds ratio from the univariate model (1.70) is much higher than the odds ratio from the fully adjusted multivariable model (1.33) in the third panel of Table 6.1. This shows that dual status, disability, and general health status have a confounding effect on the relationship 169 between age and ease with obtaining prescription medication so that when taken into consideration, those who are 65 and older are only 33% more likely to report better experiences with ease of getting pr escription medications (OR=1.33, 95% CI: 1.06, 1.66, p=0.013). The analysis below however supports the hypothesis that, in general, those that are 65 and older are much more likely to report positive experience with obtaining prescription medication than t hose that are younger than 65. Table 6.1: Unadjusted and Adjusted Odds Ratios for Ease of Obtaining Prescription Medications by Age (65+ vs. < 65 years) in MA and FFS Variable: Age Unadjusted Odds Ratio for Ease of Outcome in Age 65+ versus <65 95% CI P-value Unadjusted: 65 Years or (65+) Under 65 (<65) Years Old) 1.70 1.61 1.81 <0.0001 Adjusted for: Adjusted Odds Ratio for Ease of Outcome in Age 65+ versus <65 Race White (Ref: Nonwhite) 1.60 1.51 1.70 <0.0001 Race (Excluding Unknowns and Native Americans) White (Ref: Nonwhite) 1.61 1.52 1.71 <0.0001 Gender Male (Ref: Female) 1.70 1.61 1.80 <0.0001 Education (Ref: High School or less) 1.73 1.62 1.83 <0.0001 General Health Status Category (ghs) (Ref: Excel lent) 1.46 1.37 1.56 <0.0001 Comorbidities (4 groups = 0.1.2.3 or more) (Ref: 0 Comorbidities) 1.70 1.61 1.80 <0.0001 Proxy (Ref: No Proxy Help) 1.88 1.73 2.02 <0.0001 Dual status 1.56 1.46 1.66 <0.0001 170 (Ref: Not Dual Status) Disabled (Ref: Not Disabled) 1.32 1.12 1.56 0.001 Rural Category (Ref: Rural Area) 1.72 1.61 1.82 <0.0001 Fully Adjusted Model (adjusted for all variables; excluding unknowns and Native Americans) 1.33 1.06 1.66 0.013 Fully Adjusted Model (adjusted for all variables; including unknowns and Native Americans) 1.32 1.06 1.65 0.013 Table 6.2 below explores whether those in MA -PD plans report more positive experiences with ease of obtaining prescription medication than enrollees in FFS -PD after controlling f or socio -demographics and health characteristics. We can see from Table 6.2 that without adjusting for any demographic variables, enrollees with the drug coverage who are in MA -PD are 4% more likely to report better experiences with ease of obtaining medic ation compared to those in FFS -PD. However, this is not statistically significant (OR=1.04, 95% CI: 0.99, 1.10, p=0.137) We see from Table 6.2 that the relationship between enrollment plan (MA -PD and FFS - PD) and answering \"always\" or \"usually\" (better expe rience) for ease of obtaining prescription medication (outcome variable) does not appear to be confounded by gender, education, age, and comorbidities. Therefore, when only looking at the individual effects of each of these variables (one at a time) on the outcome (ease of obtaining medication), we see that these variables do not have a major impact on the relationship between enrollment plan and the out come. However, we see that the variables of race, proxy, dual status, disability, residence, and general health status do appear to have confounding effects on this relationship. We see that the unadjusted odds ratio in the univariate model (1.04) is a bi t less than the odds 171 ratio in the fully adjusted multivariable model (1.12). This shows that race, proxy, dual status, disability, residence, and general health status have a confounding effect on the relationship between insurance type and ease with obtaining prescription medication. When confounding is taken into consideration, those who are in MA -PD are 12 % more likely to report better experiences with ease of getting prescription medications (OR=1.12, 95% CI: 1.04, 1.21, p=0.002). The analysis below however supports the hypothesis that, in general, those enrollees in MA -PD are more likely to report positiv e experience with obtaining prescription medication than enrollees in FFS -PD.

Additional analyses for Hypothesis 3.1 explored the effects of age defined as75 and older or younger than 75 on expe rience of care for ease with obtaining prescription medications. The table below looked at whether beneficiaries with a drug benefit that are 75 and older are more likely to experience ease of obtaining medication compared to those that are younger than 75 in both MA and FFS. Table 6.3 shows the unadjusted odds ratio of the univariate model (without covariates) for ease of obtaining prescription medication for those that are 75 and older compared to those that are younger than 75. Without adjusting for an y demographic variables, enrollees with 173 the drug coverage who are 75 and older are about 26% more likely to report better experiences with ease of obtaining medication compared to those that are younger than 65 in both MA and FFS (OR =1.26, 95% CI: 1.19, 1 .33, p<0.0001). We see from Table 6.3 that the relationship between age and answering \"always\" or \"usually\" (better experience) for ease of obtaining prescription medication (outcome variable) does not appear to be confounded by race, education, comorbidi ties, general health status, dual status and residence. Therefore, when only looking at the individual effects of each of these variables (one at a time) on and the outcome (ease of obtaining medication), we see that these variables do not have a major im pact on the relationship between age and the outcome. However, we see that the variables of proxy, disability, and gender do appear to have confounding effects on this relationship. We see that the unadjusted odds ratio in the univariate model (1.26) is h igher than the odds ratio from the fully adjusted the multivariable model (1.15). This shows that proxy status, disability, and gender have a confounding effect on the relationship between age and ease of obtaining prescription medication so that when take n into consideration, those who are 75 and older are only 15% more likely to report better experiences with ease of getting prescription medications (OR=1.15, 95% CI:1.06, 1.25, p=0.001)l . The analysis below supports that, in general, those that are 75 and older are more likely to report positive experience with obtaining prescription medication than those that are younger than 75. Table 6.3: Unadjusted and Adjusted Odds Ratios for Ease of Obtaining Prescription Medications by Age (75 and older vs. younger than 75) Variable: Age Unadjusted Odds Ratio for 95% CI P-value 174 Ease of Outcome in Age 75+ versus <75 Unadjusted 75 Years or Older (75+) (Ref: Under 75 (<75) Years Old) 1.26 1.19 1.33 <0.0001 Adjusted for: Adjusted Odds Ratio for Ease of Outco me in Age 75+ versus <75 Race White (Ref: Nonwhite) 1.22 1.16 1.29 <0.0001 Race (Excluding Unknowns and Native Americans) White (Ref: Nonwhite) 1.23 1.16 1.30 <0.0001 Gender Male (Ref: Female) 1.25 1.19 1.33 <0.0001 Education Category (Ref: High School or less) 1.29 1.22 1.37 <0.0001 General Health Status Category (ghs) (Ref: Excellent) 1.22 1.16 1.30 <0.0001 Comorbidities (4 groups = 0.1.2.3 or more) (Ref: 0 Comorbidities) 1.26 1.19 1.33 <0.0001 Proxy (Ref: No Proxy Help) 1.39 1.29 1.49 <0.0001 Dual status (Ref: Not Dual Status) 1.22 1.159 1.299 <0.0001 Disabled (Ref: Not Disabled) 1.06 Category (Ref: Rural Area) 1.28 1.21 1.35 <0.0001 Fully Adjusted Model (adjusted for all variables; excluding unknowns and Native Americans) 1.15 1.06 1.25 0.001 Fully Adjusted Model (adjusted for all variables; including unknowns and Native Americans) 1.15 1.06 1.25 0.001 175 Hypothesis 3. 2: Whites with diabetes in both MA -PD and FFS -PD are expected to be more likely to have filled a prescription in the previous 6 months and more satisfied with their experience in obtaining prescriptions than non -whites after controlling for all other variables. However, Whites in MA -PD will be more satisfied with their experience in obtaining prescriptions medications than those in free standing PDPs . Hypothesis 3.2 explored the effects of race (White versus non -White) on experience of care for ease with obtaining prescription medications. The tables explores whether be neficiaries with a drug benefit that are White are more likely to experience ease with obtaining medication as compared to non -whites in both MA and FFS. Table 6.4 shows the odds ratios for ease with obtaining prescription medication for those that are white compared to non -whites ( including Unknowns and Native Americans). Table 6.5 shows the odds ratios for ease with obtaining prescription medication for those that are White compared to non-whites ( excluding Unknowns and Native Americans). Tables 6.4 and 6.5 contain very similar results. We can see from both tables that without adjusting for any demographic variables, enrollees with the drug coverage who are White are about 100% more likely to report better experiences with ease of obtaining medication as compared to non - Whites. We see from the second panel of both Tables 6.4 and 6.5 that the relationship between being White and answering \"always\" or \"usually\" (better experience) for ease with obtaining prescription medication (outcome variable) does not ap pear to be confounded by any of the 176 covariates. Therefore, when only looking at the individual effects of each of these variables (one at a time) on the outcome (ease of obtaining medication), we see that none of these variables have a major impact on the relationship between being White and the outcome. The analysis below supports the hypothesis that Whites in both MA and FFS are more likely to report positive experience with obtaining prescription medication than those who are non -whites.

We can see from the first panel of Table 6.6 that without adjusting for any demographic variables, enrollees with the drug cov erage who are 178 White in MA -PD are 9% more likely to report better expe riences with ease of obtaining medication compared to those who are White in FFS -PD (OR=1.09, 95% CI: 1.02, 1.16, p=0.011). We see from the second panel of Table 6.6 that the relationship between enrollment plans and answering \"always\" or \"usually\" (bette r experience) for ease with obtaining prescription medication (outcome variable) , among Whites, does not appear to be confounded by gender, education, and comorbidities. Therefore, when on ly looking at the individual effects of each of these variables (on e at a time) on the outcome (ease of obtaining medication), we see that these variables do not have a major impact on the relationship between plan type (MA -PD or FFS -PD) and the outcome for Whites . However, we see that the variables age, proxy, dual stat us, disabili ty, residence, and general health status do appear to have confounding effects on this relationship. We see that the unadjusted odds ratio in the univariate model (1.09) is a bit less than the odds ratio from the multivariable model (1.15). Thi s shows that age, proxy, dual status, disability, residence, and general health status have a confounding effect on the relationship between enrollment plan and ease with obtaining prescription medication, among females, so that when taken into considerati on, Whites in MA -PD ar e 15% more likely to report better experiences with ease of getting prescription medications than Whites in FFS -PD (OR =1.15, 95% CI: 1.05, 1.25, p =0.002). The analysis below supports the hypothesis that Whites in MA -PD are more like ly to report positive experience with obtaining prescription medication than their White counterparts in FFS-PD. Table 6.6: Unadjusted and Adjusted Odds Ratios for Ease of Obtaining Prescription Medications by Enrollment Plan (MA -PD vs. FFS -PD, among White s) 179 Variables: PDP Plan Type Unadjusted Odds Ratio for Ease of Outcome in MA - PD versus FFS -PD 95% CI P-value Unadjusted PDP -PD) 1.09 1.02 1.16 0.011 Adjusted for: Adjusted Odds Ratio for Ease of Outcome in MA-PD versus F FS-PD Education Category (Ref: High School or less) 1.10 1.02 1.17 0.008 Gender Male (Ref: Female) 1.10 1.03 1.17 0.006 Age Category (Ref: <65 Years) 1.05 .98 1.13 0.129 General Health Status Category (ghs) (Ref: Excellent) 1.04 .97 1.11 0.225 Comorbidities (4 groups = 0.1.2.3 or more) (Ref: 0 Comorbidities) 1.09 1.02 1.17 0.010 Proxy (Ref: No Proxy Help) 1.18 1.09 1.29 <0.0001 Disabled (Ref: Not Disabled) 1.04 .98 1.12 0.222 Rural Category (Ref: Rural Area 1.12 1.05 1.20 0.001 Dual status (Ref: Not Dual Status) 1.06 .99 1.13 0.076 Fully Adjusted Model (adjusted for all variables) 1.15 1.05 1.25 0.002 Hypothesis 3.3: Beneficiaries in MA -PD and FFS -PD with diabetes who are more educated are expected to be more sat isfied with their experience in obtaining prescriptions than those who are less educated; after controlling for other variables. 180 Hypothesis 3.3 explored the effects of education (high school education or less versus more than a high school education) on e xperience of care for ease of obtaining prescription medications. The table examines whether beneficiaries in a drug plan (MA -PD and FFS -PD) who have more than a high school education are likely to experience greater ease with obtaining medication compared to those that have a high school education or less in both MA_PD and FFS -PD. Table 6.7 shows the unadjusted odds ratio from the univariate model (without covariates) for ease with obtaining prescription medication for those that have more than a high sch ool education compared to those with a high school education or less. Without controlling for any demographic variables, enrollees with the drug coverage who have more than a high s chool education are 20% more likely to report better experiences with ease of obtaining medication compared to those that that have a high school education or less, in combined MA and FFS (OR =1.20 , 95% CI:1.14, 1.27 , p< 0.0001). We see from Table 6.7 that the relationship between education and answering \"always\" or \"usually\" ( better experience) for ease of obtaining prescription medication (outcome variable) does not appear to be confounded by age, gender, comorbidities, disability, and residence. Therefore, when only l ooking at the individual effects of each of these variables (one at a time) on the outcome (ease of obtaining medication), we see that these variables do not have a major impact on the relationship between education and the outcome. However, we see that t he variables of race, dual status, proxy, and general healt h status do appear to have confounding effects on this relationship. We see that the unadjusted odds ratio in the univariate model (1.20) is higher than the odds ratio from the fully adjusted multi variable model (.98). This shows that race, dual status, pr oxy, and general health status have a confounding effect 181 on the relationship between education and ease with obtaining prescription medication so that when taken into consideration, those who have more than a high school education are 2% less likely (OR =. 98 , 95% CI: .91 1.06, p= 0.597) than those who have a high school education or less to report better/worst experiences with ease of getting prescription medications ; this is however not significant (p=0.597). However, when proxy is taken out of the model, we see that those who have more than a high school education are 10% more likely (OR =1.10, 95% CI: 1.04 1.17, p= 0.002) to report better experiences with ease of getting prescription medications than those with a high school education or less. The anal ysis below supports the hypothesis that those with more than a high school education are more likely to report positive experience with obtaining prescription medication ( when proxy was taken out of the model) than those with less education.

Summary and Discussion This dissertation is using data from the 2009 Consumer Assessment of Healthcare Providers and Systems (CAHPS) Survey to examine beneficiary report ed experience with medical care, including self -report ease of understanding ones personal physician, ease of obtaining care, tests, and procedures, ease of making an appointment with a specialist, and ease o f filling prescriptions through Medicare Part D. This research examines experience w ith care for Medicare enrollees reporting that a doctor has told them the y have diabetes, a chronic medical condition. This is believed to be the first study examining experience with medical care for Medicare benefic iaries with diabetes using the Medica re Beneficiary Survey. The findings from this study are summarized below for each of the three specific aims. The implications of the findings are discussed after the results. Aim 1: Aim 1 examines differences in MA and FFS diabetic patient characteristics including age, gender, race, education, region of residence, self -reported health status, dual eligibility, disability, comorbidity, and proxy assistance for those who reported these variable . Differences in proport ion of diabetic beneficiaries responding to the experience of care questions, the dependent variables, are examined. Hypothesis 1.1 states that a higher proportion of MA enrollees as compared to FFS enrollees with diabetes will be younger, male, lower edu cational attainment, non -Whites and living in urban areas. It is also hypothesized that a higher proportion of FFS enrollees will be disabled, dually eligible for both Medicare and Medicaid, and us e proxy help to respond to the survey. 184 Results from the ana lysis of Hypothesis 1.1show: A higher proportion of FFS enrollees in the younger group of Medicare beneficiaries (18 -64 age group) compared to MA ( 47.08 % MA vs. 52.92% FFS), No statistically si gnificant difference in enrollment by gender between FFS and MA, A higher proporti on of MA enrollees with educational attainment of high school or less ( 55.96 %) compared to 44.04 % in FFS, A higher proportion of MA enrollees that are non -white 61.54 % compared to FFS enrollees ( 38.46 %), A higher proportio n of MA enrollees that are living in urban areas ( 65.16 %) compared to FFS enrollees ( 34.84 %), A higher proportion of disabled FFS enrollees ( 51.5%) compared to MA ( 48.5%), A higher proportion of FFS enrollees younger than 65 are duals ( 55.57 %) compar ed to MA ( 44.43 %). For enrollees older than 65, 43.18 % of duals are in FFS compared to 56.82 % in MA. A higher proportion of MA enrollees ( 53.4%) reported receiving proxy help completing the questionnaire/interview than FFS enrollees ( 46.6%, p-value=0 .01). Results of the analysis (summarized above) are consistent with Hypothesis 1.1 with the exception that a higher proportion of MA enrollees as compared to FFS enrollees with diabetes are younger, under age 65. This does make sense given that younger Medicare beneficiaries are almost all disabled, and many are dually eligible for both Medicare and Medicaid, and are more likely to be enrolled in Fee -for-Service Medicare [Nicholas, 185 2009; kff.org]. Research has shown that older Americans are less familiar and less apt to use information to navigate coverage options {{692 Greenwald,L.M. 2006; 420 Uhrig,J.D. 2006;}}. Diabetes requires ongoing management and many with diabetes have one or more additio nal chronic conditions. One might expect they would be mo re likely to enroll in MA in order to have the care management and care coordination services that MA provides. Hypothesis 1.2 states that a higher proportion of MA enrollees as compared to FFS with diabetes will report that their personal doctor explains things in a way that was easy to understand; easy to receive a test or treatment; and easy to fill a prescription. However, it is also hypothesized that a higher proportion of FFS enrollees will report more ease with getting an appointment to see a special ist as compared to MA enrollees. Results from the analysis of Hypothesis 1.2 shows: Enrollees in MA are more likely to answer that their doctors \"always\" or \"usually\" explain things in a way that was easy to understand ( 53.54 %) versus 46.46 % in FFS, p-value<0.0001. Enrollees in MA (52.06 %) are more likely to report it was easy to receive care, tests or treatments they needed than enrollees in FFS (47.94 %), Enrollees in MA are more likely to report ease with getting an appointment with a specialist tha n enrollees in FFS (52.09 % in MA versus 47.91 % in FFS), Enrollees in MA -PD are statistically (p=0.137) no more likely to report ease with using Medicare Part D to get the medicines their doctor prescribed than those in FFS -PD. 186 Results in Hypothesis 1.2 show that enrollees in MA are more likely to indicate ease with getting an appointment with a specialist than FFS (52.1% in MA versus 47.9.% in FFS). With regards to \"doctors' explanation\" and \"receiving care, tests, or treatment,\" the results again show that MA enrollees report better experiences with \"doctors' explanation\" (53.5%) and \"receiving care, tests, or treatment,\" (52.1%) than FFS enrollees. These results may be explained by the fact that care models set up by MA plans (which focuses on care co ordination and follow -up) may be effective in making sure beneficiaries understand their care plan (as explained by a doctor), and are better at making sure beneficiaries get the follow -up and specialty care they need to manage their condition than those i n FFS. The results show that MA enrollees are statistically equally likely to report ease with using Medicare to get the medicines their doctor prescribed (MA -PD 91.1% and FFS -PD 90.7%; p= 0.137). The implementation of the Medicare Modernization Act and P art D prescription drug cover age in 2006, made it possible for enrollees in MA and FFS enrollees to have access to prescription medication In some cases, research has found MA enrollees may pay less out -of-pocket and be less likely to delay refilling or not filling prescripti ons. However, MA enrollees are more likely to need to obtain prior approval to get prescriptions filled when prescribed a brand name drug as compared to FS -PD enrollees (Neuman et al. 200 7). Aim 2: Examine the relationship of age, race, gender, education, s elf-reported health status, disability, proxy assistance, region of residence, as well as co -morbidities and dual eligibility and how this varies between MA and FFS, among those who have received one 187 or more services and responded to the patient -reported experience questions. Aim 2 has four hypotheses; each of these hypotheses will be examined below. Hypothesis 2.1: After controlling for beneficiary socio -demographics and health characteristics, beneficiaries in MA and FFS combi ned who have a high school education or less will be found to have worse experience of care with regards to the four outcome variables. Comparing MA and FFS enrollees, those in MA with a high school education or less are found to have worse experience of c are than those in FFS with a high school education or less with regards to the outcome variables. Results of the analysis of Hypothesis 2.1, (summarized above) show that: Enrollees with more than a high school education report better experience with understanding a doc tor's explanation than those with a high school education or less, Enrollees with more than a high school education report slightly worse experiences with \"obtaining care, tests, or treatment\"; Enrollees with more than a high school edu cation report slightly worse experience with \"getting specialist appointment\" than those with a high school education or less, and Enrollees with more than a high school education report slightly worse experiences with \"obtaining prescription drugs,\" ho wever, this was not statistically significant. Consistent with what was hypothesis, Medicare enrollees (MA and FFS combined) with more than a high school education report better experience with ease of understanding a doctor's explanation than those with a high school education or less. This may reflect the likely advantage of more educated enrollees to more easily understand their doctor's explanation of treatment and the treatment of diabetes than enrollees with a high school 188 education or less. This may t ranslate to higher reported scores of experience of care for those with more than a high school education. With regards to the other three outcomes: \"obtaining care, tests, or treatment,\" \"getting specialist appointment,\" and \"obtaining prescription drugs, \" results show that enrollees in the combined group of MA and FFS enrollees who have more than a high school education report a more positive experience for these outcome variables when no adjustments were made for demographic and health status variables. When demographic and health status variables are included in the models, we see that those with more than a high school education are likely to report worse experiences with getting care, treatment, or tests and with ease of making appointment with special ist. Enrollees in MA and FFS do not differ statistically in their reported experience with ease of getting prescription drugs when demographic and health variables are taken into account. When looking at only those in MA with a high school education or l ess compared to those in FFS with a high school education or less, it was hypothesized that those in MA will report better experiences than those in FFS with a high school education or less. Results show that MA enrollees with a high school education or le ss report better experiences for \"obtaining care, treatment, or tests\" than those in FFS. In addition, those in MA with a high school education or less report statistically comparable experiences with \"doctors' explanation\" and \"getting specialist appointm ent,' while reporting worse experiences with \"obtaining prescription medication\" than those in FFS with a high school education or less. 189 A plausible explanation for these findings may be that more educated Medicare enrollees may be more critical about the care they receiv e and tend to rate lower than less educated Medicare enrollees. Previous research (Landon et al. 2004; Elliott et. al 2011) has found that more highly educated beneficiaries are likely to have better access to care than their counterparts i n both MA and FFS settings. More highly educated beneficiaries tend to be more negative about their experiences with care, possibly because they are more critical of or have higher expectations for the care and access to services than those with less educ ation.. In addition, differences in reported experiences of care between, those in MA with a high school education or less and those in FFS with a high school education or less may be explained by the fact that managed care plans are incentivized to impro ve the bottom - line, and many health plans have adopted care models to better manage care of patient with chronic conditions like diabetes. MA plans have been found to be better at providing programs that are designed to improve patients' adherence to treat ment regimens and physicians' adherence to professional guidelines. For example, strategies that have been routinely used by MA plans to enhance primary care of patient with diabetes \u2014including home visits, care transitions, and care coordination \u2014 have been shown to be effective in reducing hospitalization and readmission rates for Medicare beneficiaries with diabetes (Cohen et al.2012). However, FFS do not provide such services. This may be one explanation why those with a high school education or less in M A report slig htly better experience than those with a high school education or less in FFS. 190 Hypothesis 2.2: Proposes that Beneficiaries in FFS and MA with diabetes who are White will be more likely to report a positive experience with care than non -whites after controlling for socio -demographics and health characteristics. Results of the analysis of Hypothesis 2.2 show that: Medicare beneficiaries who are White are more likely to report positive experiences for all the outcome variables in the analyses ex cluding and including demographic and health variables. Previous research has consistently found socio -demographic factors explain significant variations in experiences of care reported by Medicare enrollees. Since Medicare enrollees who are non -white ten d to have lower socio -demographic status; studies have found that Medicare beneficiaries with lower socioeconomic status (SES) were more likely to face barriers to receiving quality care (Kapur et al.2006, Elliott et al. 2011). Research on both Medicare FF S and MA plans concluded that seniors with lower SES used fewer services than those with higher SES. In particular, studies have found that Medicare beneficiaries with lower SES, unlike those with higherer SES, were less knowledgeable of the benefits of go od health behaviors (e.g., not -smoking, exercise, healthy diet), and hence may have been more prone to worse outcomes (Kapur et al.2006). SES has been found to be related to the types of services utilized. For example, better educated persons have been fou nd to prefer receiving care from specialists rather than generalists or primary care physicians (Kapur et al. 2006). Other researchers have found that minorities in managed care plans have worse health outcomes relative to Whites than do those in Medicare FFS (Bonito et al. 2004). The suggested reason has been that managed care limits freedom of choice of physician and may require prior 191 approval by the primary care provider acting as a gate -keeper. One study reported that gate-keeping was especially detrime ntal to racial and ethnic minorities who may be seeking to locate culturally appropriate providers (Bonito et al. 2004). Given that non - Whites are more likely to face barriers to care relative to Whites, it is not surprising that Whites will report better experiences of care for all the outcome variables in this study. This project highlights the need to address the care of diabetes as it relates to minorities; who in general, are more likely to report worse experiences with care than Whites and experience worse health outcomes. Hypothesis 2.3: Medicare beneficiaries with diabetes who are 65 years and older in both MA and FFS will more frequently report a positive experience with obtaining care than those younger than 65 after controlling for socio -demographics and health characteristics. Also Medicare beneficiaries with diabetes who are 75 years and older in both MA and FFS will more frequently report a positive experience with obtaining care than those younger than 75 after controlling for s ocio-demographics and health characteristics. In the analysis of Hypothesis 2.3, Medicare beneficiaries were grouped into three age groups: 18 -64, 65 -74, and 75 and above. The results show that: Enrollees that are 65 and older report better experiences fo r all outcome variables than enrollees who are younger than 65. The only exception is the outcome, ease of understanding doctor's explanation, where there are no significant differences by age. Further analysis also showed that enrollees that are 75 and older report better experiences for all outcome variables than enrollees who are younger than 75. The only 192 exception again is the outcome, ease of understanding doctor's explanation, where the results are not statistically significant. Analysis of Hypothesi s 2.3 shows that in general the oldest Medicare beneficiaries tend to report better experiences of care than those that are younger than 65 and those between the ages of 65 -74. Those that are 65 -74 tend to report better experiences of care than those that are younger than 65. Previous studies have found that elderly Medicare adults (those 65 and above) do not value having a large number of choices as highly as do younger adults and that elderly beneficiaries' knowledge of their alternative insurance options in MA is poor [McWilliams et al, 2013]. Older adults may in fact appreciate the coordination of care offered by MA and have less concern about the restrictions in provider choice associated with MA plans. This may explain why they prefer enrolment in MA over FFS. Since older Medicare beneficiaries tended to be less critical of their care, it may explain their more positive responses about experiences of care than younger Medicare beneficiaries. Hypothesis 2.4: Beneficiaries who are females will be associa ted with less positive reports of experience with their overall care in both MA and FFS than males; females in FFS will report more positive experience with care than those in MA after controlling for socio -demographics and health characteristics, The fi ndings for Hypothesis 2.4 show that: In the combined MA and FFS group, no statistically significant differences in outcomes between males and females were found for doctor explanations, obtaining care, tests, or treatment, and experience with getting spe cialist appointment. For the outcome 193 variable \"obtaining prescription drugs,\" males are 16% less likely to report positive experiences than females. Females in MA report better experiences with care for the outcome variables of \"doctor explanations,\" \"ob taining care, tests, or treatment,\" and \"getting specialist appointment.\" Females in MA report worse experiences with care for the outcome variable \"obtaining prescription drugs.\" Analysis of Hypothesis 2.4 shows no differences between males and females experiences of care, except for ease of filling prescriptions. The research literature shows gender differences inquality of care for cardiovascular disease and diabetes among Medicare enrollees as it relates to screening, treating, and outcomes for these c onditions (Bird et al.2007). This study found lower quality of care for women despite the fact that women typically have higher rates of physician visits than men. A plausible explanation for females reporting better experiences of care than males in this diabetic sample may be that this group of individuals differs with regards to how they interact with the healthcare system from the general population. Since diabetes is largely a self -care chronic condition, females might be more successful in getting the resources they need to manage their condition than males. Females in MA report better experiences of care than females in FFS and this may reflect better coordination of care for chronic conditions such as diabetes which is one attribute of MA plans. Females in MA may benefit from managed care attribute of care coordination for better manag ing care of patient with chronic conditions like diabetes. In 2009 , the coverage model did not provide full coverage for preventive servi ces in FFS . The fee -for-service structure of traditional Medicare pays for clinical services delivered 194 to the patient and not specifically for services related to educate patients about self - management skills that are so essential in the management of diabetes. It may be that managed care emphasis on care coordination may enhance female enrollees reported experiences of care. AIM 3 Examine the relationship of age, race, gender, education, self -reported health status, region of residence, co -morbidities, du al eligibility, disability, a nd proxy assistance with survey on filling a prescription in the previous six months; among those who filled prescriptions, examine how the diabetic population reports experience with Part D and how this varies between MA -PD and FFS -PD. Hypothesis 3.1 states that Medicare enrollees with diabetes who are age 65 or older are expected to be more positive with their experience in obtaining prescription medications than those younger than 65. Hypothesis 3.1also proposed that enrollees with diabetes who are age 7 5 or older are expected to be more positive with their experience in obtaining prescription medications than those younger than 75; after controlling for socio - demographics and health characteristics. Further, this hypothesis proposes that those enrollees in MA -PD plans are expected to be more positive than enrollees in FFS -PD after controlling for socio -demographics and health characteristics. Results from the analysis support the hypothesis that: Those that are 65 and older are 33% much more likely to r eport positive experience with obtaining prescription medication than those that are younger than 65 (p - value=0.013), 195 Those that are 75 and older are 15% more likely to also report positive experiences with obtaini ng prescription medication than those th at are younger than 75 (p-value <0.001), and Those enrollees in MA -PD are 12% more likely to report positive experience with obtaining prescription medication than enrollees in FFS -PD (p -value= 0.002). These result s and previous research show that older Medicare beneficiaries tend to report better experiences of care than those that are younger than 65. Studies have found that elderly Medicare adults are not too concerned with having a large number of choices and that knowledge of their alternative insura nce options, especially in MA, is poor [McWilliams et al, 2013]. Thus, older adults may just be satisfied with filling a prescription and not worry about whether the medication is brand name or generic. Since older Medicare beneficiaries may tend to be le ss critical of the medication they get, it may explain their response tendency to rate higher than younger Medicare beneficiaries. The analysis also supports the hypothesis that, in general, those enrollees in MA -PD are more likely to report positive exper ience with obtaining prescription medication than enrollees in FFS -PD. Since the implementation of the Part D prescription drug coverage in 2006, research studies have been examining the experience of beneficiaries enrolled in a Medicare prescription drug program. Research from this analysis and from previous studies show that enrollees in MA -PD plans were found to pay less out -of-pocket and to be less likely to delay refilling or not filling prescriptions; MA -PD enrollees were more likely to take advantage of the 90 day mail -order option to fill prescriptions for chronic medications than FS -PD enrollees (Neuman et al. 200 7). Unlike for MA -PD enrollees where the drug benefit is attached to the medical coverage, FF -PD en rollees have to 196 navigate stand -alone dr ug plans to fill a prescription, which might be more complicated to navigate and expensive than what MA -PD enrollees may pay. It makes sense that this study will find enrollees in MA -PD plans to be more likely to report better experiences than those in FS -PD plans. Hypothesis 3.2: Whites with diabetes in both MA -PD and FFS -PD are expected to be more likely to have filled a prescription in the previous 6 months and more satisfied with their experience in obtaining prescriptions than non -whites after controll ing for all other variables. However, Whites in MA -PD will be more satisfied with their experience in obtaining prescriptions medications than those in free standing PDPs. Results from this analysis show that: Whites in both MA and FFS are 75% more likel y to report positive experience with obtaining prescription medication than those who are non -whites (p -value<.0001). Whites in MA -PD are 15% more likely to report positive experience with obtaining prescript ion medication than their White counterparts i n FFS -PD (p - value=0.002). Consistently in this study, results have shown that Whites report significantly more positive experiences with obtaining services than non -whites. For reasons already outlined above, Whites are like more able to access services th an non -whites and more likely to be satisfied with their experiences than non -whites. Analysis on Hypothesis 3.2 supports what was proposed that Whites in both MA and FFS are more likely to report positive exper ience with obtaining prescription medication than those who are non - whites. In addition whites in MA -PD are more likely to report better experiences with the drug benefit than non -whites. The finding that Whites in MA -PD report better experience 197 with the drug benefit than Whites in FS -PD is not surpr ising for reasons already outlined above. Hypothesis 3.3: Beneficiaries in MA -PD and FFS -PD with diabetes who are more educated are expected to be more satisfied with their experience in obtaining prescriptions than those who are less educated; after contr olling for other variables. Results show that: Enrollees with more than a high school education are 10% , p -value = 0.002) more likely to report positive experience with obtaining prescription medication than those with a high school education or less w hen the \"proxy\" variable was taken out of the model but not statistically significant with the variable in the model ( -2%, p -value = 0.597). In Hypothesis 2.1, results show that enrollees with more than a hig h school education report slightly worse experi ences with \"obtaining prescription drugs,\" however, this was found to be not statistically significant. In the analysis of Hypothesis 3.3, the models were run with and without the proxy variable. Proxy has been found to play a confounding role on the relat ionship between some of the independent variables and the outcome variables (see result section and Appendix B). When the models were ran including the proxy variable, the results were consistent with results in Hypothesis 2.1, (that enrollees with more th an a high school education report slightly worse experiences with \"obtaining prescription drugs,\" however, this was found not statistically significant). When the model excluded the proxy variable, the results show that enrollees with more than a high scho ol education are more likely to report positive experience with obtaining prescription medication than those with a high school education or less .. Clearly, there is 198 correlation between the proxy variable and education , when proxy was included it was not s ignificant, but enrollees with more than a high school education were seen to report worse experience with obtaining prescription medication than those with a high school education or less. When proxy was taken out of the models , those with more than a hi gh school education report better results with obtaining prescription medications than those with a high school or less education. This seem to point to an argument that those with more th an a high school education might actually report better experiences with obtaining prescription than those with a high school education or less. 199 Implications to the Medicare Program This study is the first to use Medicare Consumer Assessment of Healthcare Provider and System (MCAHPS) to compare patient experi ence of care in a national representative sample of diabetic Medicare patients who were enrolled in Medicare Fee -for-Service (FFS) and Medicare Advantage (MA) using the 2009 MCAHPS survey. Patient experience of care has become a central tenet through wh ich Medicare assesses the quality of health care delivered to Medicare beneficiaries. Patient empowerment and patient reported outcomes have has become widely recognized as a c ompelling paradigm for improving health care by holding providers accountable fo r the experiences of enrollees as they navigate the healthcare system. Currently, the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS) has developed CAHPS surveys for a number of settings: including home health, nursing home, dialysis facilities, hospitals , and health plans and Fee-for-Service; and is moving towards developing CAHPS surveys for a number of other settings: including outpatient facilities, Hospices, and emergency departments,. All of these surveys are geared towards assessing the experiences of care of these enrollees in these settings. One of the unique aspects to this study is that it uses a CAHPS survey to look at the experiences of care for a specific group of enrollees, the diabetics, that are enrolled in one of the two insurance options offered by Medicare. Beyond this, the study also looks at subgroups within this group of diabetics to further assess their experiences of care. Diabetes is one of the costli est (both in terms of resources and quality of life) chronic conditions in the Med icare program. 200 The CAHPS surveys conducted by Medicare focus on assessing experiences of care for specific settings. The primary purpose of these surveys is not to assess experiences for specific conditions or subgroups of enrollees. The value of this st udy is that it goes beyond looking at assessing experiences of care for beneficiaries enrolling in the two insurance options offered by Medicare. This study g oes further by teasing out a very important group of enrollees (those with diabetes), and within t his group, looking at how socio -demographic characteristics influences experiences of care. This study is of value to the Medicare program because it highligh ts a different approach to assessing patient experiences of care - targeting specific conditions a nd looking at the experiences of subgroups within that condition. The current approach focusses on the care setting. The study is also of value to the Medicare program because it shows that certain groups such as, non -whites, less educated, and younger age groups are more likely to have a more negative healthcare experience than older, better educated and White Medicare beneficiaries. According to the 2012 chartbook published by CMS to provide an overview of chronic conditions among Medicare beneficiaries, diabetes is among the top 5 most prevalent and high cost chronic conditions amongst Medicare enrollees. The others are: High blood pressure, High cholesterol, Heart disease, and Arthritis. Targeting these chronic conditions and looking at what is importan t to the beneficiaries with these chronic conditions might help the Medicare Program develop more effective care models that will not only improve quality of care, but also ha ve the potential to reduce costs. Findings from this project can be used to explo re differences in models of care across the Medicare program, specifically as it relates to chronic conditions. Second, this study can 201 provide information to policy makers, quality improvement organizations and other stake holders about the differences in experiences of care for different subgroups with a group that share a common chronic condition like diabetes. Third, the study highlights the fact that population subgroups do experience the healthcare system in different ways. These differences in the ex periences of subpopulations within the Medicare program should be considered as care models are being developed. As additional CAHPS data are collected in the coming years, findings from this project may provide a strong argument for monitoring experience s of care for beneficiaries in specific subgroups; especially those that have historically been considered vulnerable. 202 Chapter 8.
