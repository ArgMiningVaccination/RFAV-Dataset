The Bulletin is a compilation of all official rulem aking notices, official rule text, executive orders of the Governor, and all legislative do cuments affecting rules that ar e statutorily required to be published in the Bulletin. It may also include other rules-rel ated documents an agency may wa nt to make public through the Bulletin. State agencies are required to p rovide public notice of all rul emaking actions and must invite public input. This is done through negotiated rulemaking procedures or after proposed rulemaking has been initiated. The public receives notice that an agency has initiated proposed rulemaking procedu res through the Idaho Administrative Bulletin and a legal notice (Public Notice of Intent) that publishes in author ized newspapers throughout the state. The legal notice provides reasonable opportunity for the public to participate w hen a proposed rule publishes in the Bulletin. Interested parties may submit written comments to the agency or request public hearings of the agency, if none have been scheduled. Such submissions or requests must be presented to the agency within the time and manner specified in the individual \"Notice of Rul emaking - Proposed Rule\" for ea ch proposed rule that is published in the Bulletin. Once the comment period closes, the agency considers fully all comments and information submitted regarding the proposed rule. Changes may be made to the proposed rule at this stage of the rulemaking, but changes must be based on comments received and must be a \"logical outgrowth\" of the proposed rule. The agency may now adopt and publish the pending rule. A pending rule is \"pending\" legislati ve review for final approval. The pending rule is the agency's final version of the rulemaking that will be forwarded to the legislature for review and final approval. Comment periods and public hearings are not provided for when t he agency adopts a temporary or pending rule. CITATION TO THE IDAHO ADMINISTRATIVE BULLETIN The Bulletin is identified by the calendar year and issue numbe r. For example, Bulletin 13-1 refers to the first Bulletin issued in calendar year 2013; Bulletin 14-1 refers to the first Bulletin issued in calendar year 2014. Volume numbers, which proceed from 1 to 12 in a given year, correspond to the months of publication, i.e.; V olume No. 13-1 refers to January 2013; V olume No. 13-2 refers to February 2013; and so forth. Example: The Bulletin p ublished in January 2014 is cited as V olume 14-1. The December 2015 Bulletin is cited as V olume 15-12 . RELATIONSHIP TO THE IDAHO ADMINISTRATIVE CODE The Idaho Administrative Code is an electronic-only, online compilation of all final and enf orceable administrative rules of the state of Idaho that are of full for ce and effect. Any temporary rule that is adopted by an agency and is of force and effect is codified into the Administ rative Code upon becoming effective. All pending rules that have been approved by the legislature during the legislati ve session as final rules and any temporary rules that are extended supplement the Administrative Code. These rules are co dified into the Administrative Code upon becoming effective. Because proposed and pending rules are not enforceab le, they are published in the Administrative Bulletin only and cannot be codified into the Administrative Code until approved as final. To determine if a particular rule remains in effect or whether any amendments have been made to the rule, refer to the Cumulative Rulemaking Index . Link to it on the Administrative Rules homepage at adminrules.idaho.gov . THE DIFFERENT RULES PUBLISHED IN THE ADMINISTRATIVE BULLETIN Idaho's administrative rulemaking process, governed by the Admi nistrative Procedure Act, Title 67, Chapter 52, Idaho Code, comprises distinct rulemaking actions: negotiated, proposed, temporary, pending and final rulemaking. Not all rulemakings incorporate or require all of these actions . At a minimum, a rulemaking includes proposed, pending and final rulemaking. Many rules are adopted as tempora ry rules when they meet the required statutory criteria and agencies must, when feasible, engage in negotiated rulemaking at the beginning of the process to facilitate consensus building. In the majority of cases, the pr ocess begins with proposed rulemaking and ends with the final rulemaking. The following is a brief explanation of each type of rule.IDAHO ADMINISTRATIVE BULLETIN PREFACE Idaho Administrative Bulletin Page 5 April 4, 2018 - Vol. 18-41. NEGOTIATED RULEMAKING Negotiated rulemaking is a process in which all interested pers ons and the agency seek consensus on the content of a rule through dialogue. Agencies are required to conduct ne gotiated rulemaking whenever it is feasible to do so. The agency files a \"Notice of Int ent to Promulgate - Negotiated Rulemaking\" for publication in the Administrative Bulletin inviting interested persons to contact the agency if i nterested in discussing the agency's intentions regarding the rule changes. This process is intended to result in the for mulation of a proposed rule and the initiation of regular rulemaking procedures. One result, however, may also be that re gular (proposed) rulemaking is not initiated and no further action is taken by the agency. 2. PROPOSED RULEMAKINGA proposed rulemaking is an action by an agency wherein the age ncy is proposing to amend or repeal an existing rule or to adopt a new rule. Prior to the adoption, amendment, or repeal of a rule, the agen cy must publish a \"Notice of Rulemaking - Proposed Rule\" in the Bulletin. This notice mus t include very specific information regarding the rulemaking including all relevant state or federal statutory au thority occasioning the rulemaking, a non-technical description of the changes being made, any associated costs, gu idance on how to participate through submission of written comments and requests for public hearings, and the text of the proposed rule in legislaitve format. 3. TEMPORARY RULEMAKIN G Temporary rules may be adopted only when the governor finds tha t it is necessary for: a) protection of the public health, safety, or welfare; or b) compliance with deadlines in amendments to governing law or f ederal programs; or c) conferring a benefit. If a rulemaking meets one or more of these criteria, and with t he Governor's approval, the agency may adopt and make a temporary rule effective prior to receiving legislative authorization and without allowing for any public input. The law allows an agency to make a temporary rule immediately e ffective upon adoption. A temporary rule expires at the conclusion of the next succeeding regular legislative session unless the rule is extended by concurrent resolution, is replaced by a fina l rule, or expires under its o wn terms. 4. PENDING RULEMAKING A pending rule is a rule that has been adopted by an agency und er regular rulemaking procedures and remains subject to legislative review before it becomes a final, enforc eable rule. When a pending rule is published in the Bulletin, the agency is required to include certain information in the \"Notice of Rulemaking - Pending Rule.\" This includes a statement giving the reasons for adopting the rule, a statement regarding when the rule becomes effective, a description of how it differs from the proposed rule, and ide ntification of any fees being imposed or changed. Agencies are required to republish the text of the pending rule when substantive changes have been made to the proposed rule. An agency may adopt a pending rule that varies i n content from that which was originally proposed if the subject matter of the rule remains the same, the pending ru le change is a logical outgrowth of the proposed rule, and the original notice was written so as to assure that member s of the public were reasonably notified of the subject. It is not always necessary to republish all the text of the pen ding rule. 5. FINAL RULEMAKINGA final rule is a rule that has been adopted by an agency under the regular rulemaking procedures and is of full force and effect. IDAHO ADMINISTRATIVE BULLETIN PREFACE Idaho Administrative Bulletin Page 6 April 4, 2018 - Vol. 18-4HOW TO USE THE IDAHO ADMINISTRATIVE BULLETIN Rulemaking documents produced by state agencies and published i n the Idaho Administrative Bulletin a r e organized by a numbering schematic. Each state agency has a two-digit identification code number known as the \"IDAPA\" number. (The \"IDAPA\" Codes are listed in the alphabetical/nume rical index at the end of this Preface.) Within each agency there are divisions or departments to which a two-digit \"TITLE\" number is assigned. There are \"CHAPTER\" numbers assigned within the Title and the rule text i s divided among major sections that are further subdivided into subsections. An example IDAPA number is as foll ows: IDAPA 38.05.01.200.02.c.ii. \"IDAPA\" refers to Administrative Rules in general that are subject to the Administrative Procedures Act and are required by this act to be published in the Idaho Administrativ e Code and the Idaho Administrative Bulletin. 1. \"38.\" refers to the Idaho Department of Administration \"05.\" refers to Title 05 , which is the Department of Admi nistration's Division of Purch asing \"01.\" refers to Chapter 01 of Title 05, \"Rules of the Division of Purchasing\" \"200.\" refers to Major Section 200, \"Content of the Invitation to Bid\" \"02.\" refers to Subsection 200. 02. \"c.\" 200.02. c. \"ii.\" refers to Subsection 200.02.c. ii. DOCKET NUMBERING SYSTEM Internally, the Bulletin is organized sequentially using a rule docketing system. Each rulemaking that is filed with the Coordinator is assigned a \"DOCKET NUMBER.\" The docket numbe r is a series of separated by a hyphen \"-\", r (the two-digit agency code) in the Bulletin. The following example is a breakd own of a typical rule docket \"38-\" denotes the agency's this case the Department of Administration. \"0501-\" refers to the TITLE AND CHAPTER numbers of the agency rule being promulgated; in this case the Division of Purchasing (TITLE 05 ), Rules of the Division of Purchasing (Chapter 01). \"1401\" denotes the year and sequential order of the docket being publ ished; in this case the numbers refer to the first rulemaking action published in calendar year 2014. A subsequent rulemaking on this same rule chapter in calendar year 2014 would be designated as \" 1402\". The docket number in this scenario would be 38-0501-1402 . Within each Docket, only the affected sections of chapters are printed. (See Sections Affected Index in each Bulletin for a listing of these.) The individual sections affec ted are printed in the Bulletin sequentially (e.g. Section \"200\" appears before Section \"345\" and so on). Whenever the seq uence of the numbering is broken the following statement will appear: (BREAK IN CONTINUITY OF SECTIONS)IDAHO ADMINISTRATIVE BULLETIN PREFACE Idaho Administrative Bulletin Page 7 April 4, 2018 -

Cur rently, apprentice registrations last five years. An apprentice must attend four years of school and work 8,000 hour s on the job to be eligible to become a journeyman electrician. An apprentice must a lso attend at least two years of school and perform at least 4,000 hours of work experience in order to renew an apprentice registration. In ord er to renew a registration, a renewal applicant who has not met those minimum requirements must demonstrate extenuating circumstances exist tha t prevent the applicant from achieving those requirements. Apprentices who have not pas sed the journeyman's test within two years of finishing school must also repeat the fourth year of school. Ad ditionally, all apprentices are required to receive direct on the job supervision from a journeyman electrician in a ratio o f n o m o r e t h a n t w o a p p r e n t i c e s f o r e v e r y journeyman. Journeymen licensed in other states cannot be issue d an apprentice registration. The Division and Board have determined that these requirements have been difficult for many in the trade to achieve. Accordingly, the Board is considering modification of the rules, as appropriate, to address the needs of the evolving industry.

As noted in the proposed rule, published in the October 4, 2017, Idaho Administrative Bulletin, Volume 17-10, on page 407 , and in the pending rule published in the December 6, 2017, Idaho Administrative Bulletin, Volume 17-12, on page 68 , the Board intended to seek a fee change for nonresident pharmacist registrations if its agency l egislation also passed. House Bill 351 was signed into law on March 7, 2018, with an immediate effective date. As such , this rule adjusts the nonresident pharmacist registration to $290. TEMPORARY RULE JUSTIFICATION: Pursuant to Sections 67-5226(1)(b), Idaho Code, the Governor h as found that temporary adoption of the rule is appropriate for th e following reasons: The Board of Pharmacy has six rule dockets that were approved b y the 2018 Idaho legislature with an effective date of July 1, 2018. This change is intended to coincide with the effective date of these existing rule dockets. FEE SUMMARY: Pursuant to Section 67-5226(2), the Governor has found that th e fee or charge being imposed or increased is justified and necessary to avoid immediate danger and the fee is described herein: This rule adjusts the nonresident pharmacist registration from $250 to $290. Nonresident pharmacists who held both the registration and a separate controlled substance regis tration will still retain a net savings of $20 per year.

In May 2016, EPA entered into a consent decree with Northwest E nvironmental Advocates to reconsider EPA's 2010 approval of Idaho's human health criteria for arsenic. In September 2016, EPA disapproved Idaho's human health criteria of 10 \u00b5g/L arsenic for both consumption of fish only and consumption of fish & water. The consent decree requires that EPA propose new human health criteria for arsenic by November 15, 2018, and that EPA either approve Idaho's submittal of revised human health criteria for arsenic or promulgate federal criteria by July 15, 2019. This rulemaking will enable Idaho to adopt human health criteri a for arsenic under state rulemaking and may prevent federal promulgation of criteria for Idaho by EPA. The text of the rule will be drafted by DEQ in conjunction with a negotiating committee made up of persons having an interest in the development of this rule. DEQ will ex plore the use of updated arsenic toxicity information and bioaccumulation factors to d erive human health criteria for consumption of fish only and consumption of fish & water using Idaho specific inputs for cancer risk factor and fi sh consumption rates. In addition, DEQ will collect ambient water quality data to determine background concentrations of arsenic in Idaho wat ers. Idahoans that recreate in, drink from, or fish Idaho's surface waters and all who disc harge pollutants to those same waters may be interested in participating in this rulemaking. Upon conclusion of negotiations, DEQ intends to publish a propo sed rule for public comment in the fall of 2018 a n d t h e n p r e s e n t t h e f i n a l p r o p o s a l to t h e I d a h o B o a r d o f E n v i r onmental Quality (Board) in November 2018 for adoption of a pending rule. If adopted by the Board, the rule w ill be reviewed by the 2019 Idaho Legislature. EFFECTIVE FOR CLEAN WATER ACT PURPOSES: Water quality standards adopted and submitted to EPA since May 30, 2000, are not effective for federal Clean Water Act (CWA) purposes until EPA approves them (see 40 CFR 131.21 ). This is known as the Alaska Rule. This rulemaking will be pr omulgated so that the existing rule, which continues to be effective for CWA purposes, remains in the Idah o Administrative Code until EPA approves the rule revisions. Notations explaining the effectiveness of the rule s ections are also included. Upon EPA approval, the revised rule will become effective for CWA purposes and the pre vious rule and notations will be deleted from the Idaho Administrative Code. Information regarding the status of EPA review will be posted at http:// www.deq.idaho.gov/epa-actions-on-proposed-standards ASSISTANCE ON TECHNICAL QUESTIONS AND SUBMISSION OF WRITTEN COM MENTS: F o r assistance on questions concerni ng this rulemaking, contact Jas on Pappani at Jason.Pappani@deq.idaho.gov, (208) 373-0515.
