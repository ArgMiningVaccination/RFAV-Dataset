CONTENT AND ORGANIZA TION OF THIS GUIDE 05 | REACHING EVER Y DIS TRICT1. INTR ODUC TION 1.1 BACKGROUND AND R ATIONALE FOR RE VISION Expanded Program on Immunization (EPI) is responsible for vaccines and vaccination to contr ol, eliminat e and eradicat e vaccine preventable diseases (VPDs). Having strong immunization systems to deliv er vaccines to those who need them most will play a signi\u0000cant role in achieving the health, equit y and economic objec tives of several global development goals . These include the 2030 Sustainable Dev elopment Goals (SDGs), the 2011- 2020 Decade ersal Health Coverage (UHC ) agenda, the 2011-2020 Global Vaccine Action Plan (GVAP), the Global Routine Immunization Strat egy and Plan (GRISP), and the Reg ional Strat egic Plan for Immunization 2014-2020. The Reaching Every District (RED) strate gy has played a key role in successfully strengthening African immunization systems to sustainably and equitably increase immunization coverage rates to meet established targets sinc e the early operationally-f 1) planning and management of resour ces; 2) reaching all eligible populations; 3) engag communities; 4) conduc ting suppor tive super vision; and 5) monit oring and using data for action. In 2007, WHO and partners evaluat ed the implementation of RED strat egies in nine African countries . Results demonstrat ed impr oved coverage in eight of the nine countries; an increased number of immunization outr each sessions in all distric ts visit ed; and mor e frequent super vision in seven of the nine countries . These results led to a revision of the RED Guide in 2008, which promot ed RED as a platf orm for impr oving the deliv ery of other Primar y Healthcar e Services, in the spirit of the 2008 Ouagadougou Declaration on Primar y Health Care (PHC ) and Health Systems Strengthening (HSS) in Africa and WHO's Global Immuniza tion Vision and Strategy (GIV S) Goal number 4. Endorsed by the World Health Assembly (WHA ) in 2012, the 2011-2020 Global Vaccine Action Plan (GVAP) de\u0000nes a framew ork and helps countries set national and distric t vaccination coverage targets , which are included in WHO's Africa Regional 2014-2020 Strategic Plan for Immuniza tion . The RED appr oach has contribut ed increasing DPT3 coverage in Africa from 57% to 80% between 2000 and 2014. However, fewer than 50% of African countries achiev ed the GIVS or GVAP national targets of 90% DPT3 coverage by 2015 (16 countries) \u0000 , among which 13* maintained this level for 3 consecutiv e years . Mindful of this and the need for strong immunization systems to deliv er new er vaccines to those who need them the most, in 2016-17, WHO and partners , in consultation with countries , have revised the 2008 RED guidelines to re\u0000ec t new developments . \u0000 Algeria*, Bost wana*, Eritrea*, G ambia*, ambia,CHAPTER 1 TION 06 | REACHING EVER Y DIS TRICT1.2 PURPOSE AND TARGE T AUDIENCES RED aims to strengthen immunization systems by impr oving planning , manag ing available resour ces, ser vice deliv ery and monit oring , in the c ontext of primar y healthcar e based on communit y needs . This in turn impr oves equitable and sustainable access to vaccines for every age-eligible person and reduc es vaccine -preventable diseases (VPDs). The purpose of the RED guide is to suppor t countries to plan and implement the \u0000ve components of the RED approach so as to strengthen immunization systems to sustainably and equitably increase acce ss to and use of vaccination services (as measur ed by coverage rates and equit y indicat ors). The 2017 RED guide and the guide's planning and monit oring tools , like earlier versions , are intended for adaptation and use by national immunization programs . It is primarily desig ned as a resour ce for distric t, health facilit y, and comm unit y teams to impr ove their immunization services. No single guide can cover all the information, methods , skills, and t ools r equir ed t o impr ove immunization ser vices. Therefore, other r esour ces which are available to strengthen immunization services are referenced throughout this guide . Aim of the RED Appr oach Aim of this Guide National Immuniza tion Progr ams: To help adapt the RED Guide for speci\u0000c countr y use or revise existing countr y RED guides; to help advocate for funding to strengthen immunization systems within the Comprehensive immunization Multi- Year Plan (cMY P), health sector or annual planning process. Regional/P rovincial level: To guide training of distric t health teams to incorporat e budget allocation, development, implementation and monit oring of RED strat egies and to suppor t health facilities by actively promoting micr o- planning , using information to monit or progress, detect and solv e problems , and ensur e the qualit y of service deliv ery. Health facility level: To help guide facilities to develop accurat e micr o-plans , monit or the implementation of EPI service deliv ery, and link facilities with communities to impr ove access, acceptabilit y, appr opriat eness , and utilization of services. Community level eligible popula tions: To guide communit y resour ce persons and leaders on engag ing with health facilities in the development, implementation, and monit oring of health facility micro-plans; to promote defaulter tracking, determination of target populations, communit y registration, and leverag ing local resour ces to suppor t outr each and mobile services. Technical Partners: To guide key partners on the RED appr oach for promoting coordination of technical and \u0000nancial resour ces to reach every communit y in every distric t. Speci\u0000c guidanc e related to the role of each stakeholder in deliv ering immunization services is described throughout the guide .

The 2017 RED guide takes into consideration a review of best prac tices and the emer ging issues sinc e 2008. These include various global initiatives that provide new resources and renewed focus on targets for sustainabilit y, addr ess inequities between communities and bett er integration across health programs . In recent years , immunization stakeholders have both narr owed and intensi\u0000ed their focus on closing gaps in immunization services at the communit y level. Inno vativ e strat egies to reduc e these pockets of local inequities are referred to as \"Reaching Every Communit y\" or \"Reaching Every Child \" (REC ). The principles behind REC - an appr oach which reinforces immunization session planning through an \"equit y lens \" - have been woven into the strategies and tools described in this document. This includes more emphasis on community-based interventions at the sub-distric t level. This revitaliz ed RED guide emphasiz es \u0000ve impor tant areas for immunization programmes in reducing inequit y in immunization coverage , integr ation of health services, deliv ering vaccines beyond infanc y using a life course appr oach, focusing on urban, poor and mar ginaliz ed populations , and paying special attention to insecur e and con\u0000ic t areas. CHAPTER 1 | INTRODUC TION inequities: Even though national immunization coverage rates have generally increased in man y African countries , inequities persist among dierent communities . These are often driv en by dierences in ethnicit y, income , plac e of residenc e, nomadic lifestyle, mat ernal education, or gender . This guide has additional focus on immunization micr o-planning based on addr essing identi\u0000ed equit y appr oach suppor ts ts of this appr oach have been incorporat ed into RED and include mor e emphasis on equit y analy sis at the sub-distric t level, including e contexts, and vaccine schedules provide an oppor tunit y for contac t between the health system and recipient. To avoid missed oppor tunities , increase system ecienc y and maximiz e health, integrating the deliv ery of other health interventions at the time of vaccination should be consider ed. Immunization systems deliv er vaccines at relativ ely high coverage rates, compar ed to other interventions . Immunization services can be encouraged to deliv er multiple interventions to women, children and vulnerable populations at the same time. This RED Guide emphasiz es the renew ed political commitment for multi-sec tor, multi-pr ogram integrated primar y health care, and Chapt er 2 provides considerations for integration. 1 INEQUITIES 2 INTEGR ATION 08 | REACHING EVER Y DIS TRICT 5 4 3 2 1CHAPTER 1 | INTRODUC TION 3 BEY OND INF ANCY 1.4 AD APT ATION This guide contains the principles and tools that can practically be adapted to each country's set of circumstanc es, and , at the sub-national level, made context-speci\u0000c , depending on the target populations to be reached . However, no guide can apply to all countries or circumstanc es. This RED guide is not an instruc tion manual and may need to be renamed , depending on the administrativ e struc ture. Careful preparation and the process of adapting the RED strat egies to local circumstanc es can, in itself , strengthen the overall immunization program. Examples of adaptation include modifying the suggest ed tools or adding new ones . The guide can be cust omiz ed by adding new tools to the check lists at the beg inning of each chapt er. 1.5 STR ATEGIES RED involves the national level, but the \u0000ve components are implement ed at distric t (or smaller administration units) and health facilit y levels. As noted, RED prepar es distric ts to suppor t health facilities by actively promoting micr o-planning , using information to monit or progress, detect and solv e problems , and to ensur e the qualit y of service deliv ery. RED also promot es linking health facilities with communities to impr ove access, acceptabilit y, appr opriat eness and utilization of health services. Going beyond infanc y and women of child-bearing age and adopting a life cycle appr oach: As mor e new vaccines are introduc ed, schedules increasingly need to go beyond the \u0000rst year of life, using a life cycle or life course appr oach to deliv ery. Vaccines need to be deliv ered during the 2nd year of life, as boost ers in childhood (e.g., TT or Td), to adolesc ents (e.g., HPV ), to pregnant women, and to other adults. An expanded life course approach to immunization provides a chanc e to further integrate immunization with other primar y healthcar e interventions , such as Vitamin A supplementation, nutrition, growth monit oring de-worming , and EPI models and RED appr oaches are based on reaching vulnerable rural populations and overcoming mainly geog raphical barriers . Increasing numbers of unreached populations are born in Africa's cities or are migrating to them. Urban infrastructures are often not prepared to provide eective services for all eligible populations , and ther e is a need to addr ess social as well as physical barriers to service access and utilization. Insecurit y: Con\u0000ic t situations , insecurit y, and natural disast ers increasingly displac e people in man y parts of Africa, and ther e is an emer ging need to addr ess the needs of these vulnerable populations . Services for these people often cannot be deliv ered through traditional government channels . Instead, NGOs or communit y-based mechanisms may need to plan and implement immunization services for these populations . 5 INSECURIT Y4 URB ANIZ ATION 09 | REACHING EVER Y DIS TRICTFigure 1: THE FIVE RED C OMPONENTSCHAPTER 1 | INTRODUC TION 1.6 THE FIVE C OMPONENT S The RED appr oach consists of \u0000ve components (see Figur e 1 belo w). Although this Guide describes each component in a separat e section, it is impor tant to implement the RED appr oach as an interlinked process, as the content and concepts of each component overlap and link with each other .

If ther e is an existing RED appr oach, review and updat e it. If not, take time to develop one as an eort to strengthen immunization services, considering the following: 1. Establish a Core Team. Decide on a core team with an eective leader for adapting or updating your RED strategy. Select sta with \u0000eld experience in the RED component areas and choose key outside representativ es from local government, the communit y, or partners . The numbers in the team should be as ecient as possible , perhaps up to six members . This core team will also be useful for introducing your RED appr oach to other areas in the MOH, other health workers , local ocials , and the communit y. 2. De\u0000ne key par tners and establish a forum for coordinating RED with other health services. This may be the Immunization Inter-A genc y Coordination Committ ee (ICC) or National Immunization Technical Advisor y Group (NIT AG) or another suitable forum that could include NGOs , communit y organizations , privat e sector, academics or parliamentarians . This group should be able to discuss RED ideas and plans with other program managers , coordinating operational , \u0000nancial and human resour ces. The RED activities , tools and indicat ors should contribute to immunization system strengthening and, more broadly, to health systems strengthening . 3. Be realistic . The RED appr oach needs to be planned and implement ed in coordination with other health services, as well as the available budget, health worker capacit y, and other health care activities . 4. Consider national policies: The RED appr oach must contribut e and refer to the broader context, such as the cMY P, national immunization and health plans and development policies . 5. De\u0000ne terms: De\u0000ning key terms such as eligible populations , communities , ethnic groups , targets for coverage and others , is impor tant, as they add clarit y. 6. Use existing syst ems and resourc es. Consider how RED will \u0000t with existing MOH and distric t training , planning , \u0000nancing for health services, communications , logistics and the health information system. It is impor tant to use existing surveys and repor ts - especially information about local communit y participation (see Chapt er 5).

When considering whether or how to integrate immunization services with other interventions , ther e are several criteria to consider (see Figur e 2.1 belo w). In addition, ther e are fundamental questions to ask when exploring the idea of integrating immunization services with other programs: 1. What to integrate? Give preference to high impact interventions while recognizing not all such interventions lend themselv es for integration into routine immunization service; 2. Is it appr opria te? Does integration 'make sense' for the local population and context; 3. Is it eective? Monit or results of interventions and emplo y evidenc e-based interventions; 4. Is it \u0000exible?

Is it acceptable? To providers and clients; provide necessar y education and Vaccines deliv ered on a regular , scheduled basis to eligible populations often achiev e high coverage rates. An established immunization service provides an eective platf orm for deliv ering other essential mat ernal and child health services. The \u0000ve RED components have potential to strengthen systems to increase access to other health care programs and services. For example , RED micr o-planning can be used to identify underser populations , estimat e commodit y needs , allocat e human resour ces, and to develop service deliv ery strat egies and coordinat ed super vision for all PHC interventions . RED's suppor tive super vision and monit oring strat egies and tools can be expanded for monit oring and super vising other PHC programs . Delivering integrated health services can be more cost-eective, and consequently more sustainable. Integrated services also help to reduc e missed oppor tunities and to impr ove the overall health of the communit y. Financing and manag ing the logistics of multiple commodities can be mor e challeng ing with varying logistics requir ements and deliv ery schedules . However, careful planning and coordination can lower costs of distributing vaccines , drugs , and other health care supplies . Potential risks: If not thoughtfully planned and based on human resour ce and health system capacities , integration is mor e complex and time -consuming and can overbur den health workers with too man y tasks , leading to poor er qualit y services. Consequently , integrated activities must be planned with the individual health worker and communit y needs in mind , prioritizing the most critical program areas and communit y needs for attention. For example , only attaching every program 's super vision check list into a single document, going from a one -page check list to six pages , does not eectively integrate super vision. Eective integrated super vision requir es qualit y capacit y-building time for the health worker , not only a check list.

It facilitat es identi\u0000cation and prioritization of programme needs to impr ove performanc e. Careful planning and focused management of resour ces by national , distric t and health facilit y sta are essential for deliv ering eective, high qualit y immunization and other health services. Like management, planning must be active and continuous , not only an annual preparation of documents and spreadsheets for a higher administrativ e level. Participa tory planning with key program sta and ministr y units , such as \u0000nanc e, from the beg inning and with the communit y partners , promot es ownership . Ownership contribut es local information which promot es advocac y for securing budgets , which is a critical step at all levels. RED micr o-planning is an integral part of overall distric t and health facilit y planning . An integr planning e appr oaches to maximiz e resour ces and exposes potential problems that might arise from integrated service deliv ery. This allows development of appr opriat e strat egies for resolving operational and \u0000nancial problems before they become major barriers . Integrated planning maximiz es use of sta time and resour ces, rather than duplicating sta eort and operational expenditur es. Ideally , the planning process beg ins at the health facilit y level with input from the community . Communit y members can help reduc e inequities by providing accurat e communit y head counts and assisting with the development of operational and social maps , as well as providing prac tical and mor e reliable information for the distric t plan and budget. In areas of insecurit y, input into planning may be needed from non-traditional partners , such as the militar y.

An eective micr o-plan will suppor t health facilities and distric t teams to: i) Identify which target populations are eligible for immunization services for the next year and calculat e requir ed supply needs; ii) Desig n data and graphic mapping which illustrat es well-de\u0000ned catchment areas identifying wher e the eligible populations live. This could include GIS information; iii) Prioritiz e plans to reach all target populations with immunization services on a continuous basis , according to the national schedule . For infants this is a minimum of four times a year; iv) De\u0000ne realistic local actions (based on available operations , economic and social barriers) for impr oving and sustaining coverage; and v) Reduc e inequities and impr ove qualit y of services.

Steps for RED Micro-Planning: Health Facility & Distric t 1. PREP ARATIONS: 25 | REACHING EVER Y DIS TRICT 2. SITU ATION ANAL YSIS: Before developing the actual micr o-plan, planners should know as much as possible about the eligible populations and past immunization trends . Updat ed catchment area maps , population data, and immunization programme repor ts are starting points in the micr o-planning process. The health facilit y a. Oper ational map: The process for draf ting an operational map should include: Identi\u0000cation of maps already developed and used by local government administration Coordination by distric t level, to ensur e no areas or populations are left out; Use of technology with GIS and digital maps , when possible; Dev elopment by health workers serving the catchment area; Identi\u0000cation of the high risk and mar ginaliz ed populations to bett er understand the underlying barriers to service access and use An operational map should include: De\u0000ned \"catchment area\": the geog raphical area and communities covered under \u0000xed sites, outr each sites or child health days; Impor tant landmarks including schools , government gathering points , faith-based institutions , hard-to-reach areas, rivers, mountains , roads , transit points such as: nomad meeting points , busy transpor t and mig ration routes; Identi\u0000cation of areas with low coverage , including \"high risk communities \"; Major climat e and geog raphical barriers to service ery, such as seasonal \u0000ooding and impassable roads; Distanc es and travel time between key sites Urban areas could use existing street maps , Google Earth maps , or polio or measles campaig n maps . These can help map out areas of dense populations , mig rant populations , slum areas, social struc tures and NGOs or privat e sector entities who deliv er services. See Tool 1c in the Annex for several examples of health facilit y and distric t oper ational maps . These are graphic representations of catchment areas (urban and rural) showing geog raph y of an area, landmarks & gathering points , key high- risk populations and their attribut es, social barriers and deliv ery strat egies.CHAPTER 3 | PLANNING AND M ANA GEMENT OF RESOURCES HEAL TH FACILITY 26 | REACHING EVER Y DIS TRICTb. Social map: A social map is a means of identifying populations at high risk of not accessing or using immunization services and developing program actions to overcome barriers they face to help ensur e equit y. A social map should include A list of high risk communities in the catchment area Names of villages/sit es for MNCH services Populations of these communities Main barriers to achieving full immunization among these communities Recommendations for programme actions and strat egies See Tool 1b in the Annex for an example of a social map c. Popula tion data and denomina tors A social map is a means of identifying populations at high risk of not accessing or using immunization services and developing program actions to overcome barriers they face to help ensur e equit y. A social map is a means of identifying populations at high risk of not accessing or using immunization services and developing pro-equit y program actions to overcome these barriers . A social map should include estimat es of the eligible populations who live in a catchment area. This is a crucial step for micr o- planning . The population estimat es should align with \u0000gur es in the Monthly Activit y Repor ts (or equivalent) and the DVDM T (or equivalent). 'Ocial' estimat es of a health facilit y's catchment population are often provided annually from higher levels. These estimates are based on projec tions from the latest census and based on averaged population growth rates. These \u0000gur es may be tied to budget resour ce allocation and may not be accurat e, especially in areas with high rates of mig ration/immig ration or insecurit y. It is ther efore impor tant to regularly review population estimat es local levels and triangula te informa tion from distric t and health facilit y levels to get the most accurat e operational population estimat e. These types of information may include: Total number of childr en in the target age group in the catchment area (as opposed to the number of childr en that would achiev e a particular coverage target); Local communit y head counts at the beg inning of the planning cycle; Communit y registers fr om local authorities , polio and measles SIA data or data fr om other pr ograms . If this data is only a vailable at pr ovinc e lev el, it ma y be w orth tr ying t o ac cess this f or local lev el planning purposes . To review an example data and local population growth rates; CHAPTER 3 | PLANNING AND M ANA GEMENT OF RESOURCES 27 | REACHING EVER Y DIS TRICTInformation on nomadic or other mig rant populations , their routes and timing of movement; and The immunization register, which may be used as a birth register and ther efore estimat e infant populations , as well as helping to follow-up infants on the default er track ing list.

While estimating your resour ce needs , consider these questions: Were sucient funds received last year and what was spent? Is mor e or less funding expec ted next year? Who will carr y out the proposed immunization activities? What resour ces are needed to implement the proposed activities? What resour ces are available for these activities and from whom? Are ther e any oppor tunities for sharing costs among other MCH services?

In addition to geographical considerations, reaching target populations includes bridging socioec onomic and other inequities . To develop the most eective strat egy or combination of strat egies, the health team must identify and locat e all immunization- eligible childr en and adults . Then the health team determines which groups are at high risk for not completing their requir ed immunizations , and ther eby at high VPDs . Eective service deliv ery strat egies are based on clearly de\u0000ned reasons for low vaccination coverage , including logistical , cultural , or \u0000nancial barriers , and inadequat e performanc e of immunization services. A high-risk population or community is a group of individuals who are at high risk of being under-served with vaccination services, and therefore susceptible to vaccine preventable diseases. These high-risk groups can include but are not limited to nomadic populations, migrants, refugees, certain faith-based or ethnic communities, the urban poor, or individuals displaced by insecurity, natural disaster or con\u0000ict situations. HELPFUL TIPS Reaching All Eligible Popula tions is not just a task for the health facilit y, but all levels in the Ministr y of Health. National policies must suppor t implementation of the RED micr o-planning for all programs . Well-planned , integrated services use scar ce resour ces mor e eectively. The process of Reaching All Eligible Popula tions beg ins at the national level and with coordinat ed policies , projec ts, and budgeting which suppor t integrated management and deliv ery of services. CHAPTER 4 | REA CHING ALL ELIGIBLE POPULA TIONS REA CHING ALL ELIGIBLE POPUL ATIONS 38 | REACHING EVER Y DIS TRICTRegions and Distric ts must also be involved. They ensur e adequat e resour ces for health facilit y micr o-plans and that accurate target populations (denominators) are included, mapping is consolidated, and that all communities are clearly de\u0000ned and reached appr opriat ely. Action- orient ed distric t communication and advocacy plans which \u0000t the needs of communities are vital for eectively \u0000nding and reaching the unimmuniz ed and the under-immuniz ed. At the health facility RED focuses on three basic Routine Immunization deliv ery strat egies: \u0000xed, outr each, and mobile . Fixed services refer to services oered in the health facilit y. Outr each means services deliv ered in the communit y by health workers who go to the communit y and return to the health facilit y in the course of the working day. Mobile services refer to sessions that are conduc ted by teams that travel to plac es distant from any health facilit y. The teams usually stay out at least one night. Mobile sessions are scheduled when needed; teams often go to homes , \u0000elds , workplac es and schools , wher ever the population is living . 4.2 HOW TO REA CH ALL ELIGIBLE POPUL ATIONS The de\u0000nition of \"eligible populations \" has greatly expanded . The immune response to new vaccines , the need for boost er doses , and disease patt erns of emer ging infections all requir e vaccine deliv ery schedules that go beyond infanc y and use a life cycle appr oach. To maximiz e health bene\u0000ts and return on investments , health systems need to deliv er to mor e pregnant women, school childr en, adolesc ents and vulnerable adults . This requir es a change in think ing beyond traditional vaccine schedules and , in the context of a primar y healthcar e appr oach, be mor e alig ned t o a lif e cycle or c ontinuum of lif e appr oach t o deliv ery (see F igur e 4.1 belo w). This should encourage inno vativ e deliv ery mechanisms to reach all eligible populations (in schools and in plac es wher e mothers gather , for example). Figure 4.1: THE LIFE CYCLE APPRO ACHCHAPTER 4 | REA CHING ALL ELIGIBLE POPULA TIONS 39 | REACHING EVER Y DIS TRICTAdolesc enc e and before pr egnanc y1 year 5 years 10 y earsBirth 20 health needs of populations by age can stimulat e links between the life cycle appr oach and integration. For example , HPV introduc tion at adolesc ents , such as Td/TT vaccination, menstrual hygiene education, sexual and reproduc tive health education and HIV prevention. Consider the life cycle appr oach when planning for reaching all eligible populations . Five major steps to r each eligible popula tions : 1: Review the M icro-Plan and Design Str ategies Dev elop the most eective strat egy or combination of strat egies for Reaching All Eligible Popula tions . Use the information in the health facilit y micr o-plans and perform the following tasks: Review the micr o-plan and the frequenc y of immunization sessions in the past 3-6 months , in particular in those areas that are previously underser ved, to sustain and raise coverage . Iden tify the groups that need special attention and secur e the resour ces needed to reach them (e.g., coordinat e with the agricultur e sector to reach nomads , political authorities or NGOs to reach insecur e areas, etc.). Monitor ecienc y of the immunization sessions (i.e., ensur e all targets are being reached , and if not, work with communities to reorient strat egies) Regularly meet with leaders of communities that resist or are reluc tant about immunization; discuss the issues and \u0000nd solutions . Plan for additional opportunities to boost coverage through Periodic Intensi\u0000cation of Routine Immunization (PIRI), Child Health Days (CHDs), African Vaccination Week (AVW) and campaig ns. These are planned eorts to reach populations that are not reached systematically using the RED appr oach. are organiz ed in areas wher e the systematic RED appr oach is not possible (e.g., for nomadic PIRIs populations , in seasonally inac cessible areas, during humanitarian crises , etc.). are integrated events for deliv ery of immunizations , Vitamin A, dew orming and other high-impac t CHDs interventions typically to childr en under \u0000ve and pregnant women for broader MNCH, but the age range is tailor ed to the target population of the interventions that are deliv ered. is a week to advocat e for and deliv er immunization. It also promot es deliv ery of other high-impac t AVW life-saving interventions . 2: Extend Immuniza tion to A ll Age Gr oups According to national immunization policies: Implement the principles outlined in the life cycle appr oach Catch-up childr en who did not complet e their series in the \u0000rst year of life, after their \u0000rst birthda y. Include childr en in their 2nd year of life for second dose of measles/rubella- containing vaccines , DTP boost er and other vaccines , as appr opriat e, and provide immunization and preventiv e care sessions for childr en under \u0000ve. Find out why childr en beyond 1 year are not being immuniz ed (this may include issues related to health worker or caregiver's knowledge). These reasons may dier from infant immunization barriers .CHAPTER 4 | REA CHING ALL ELIGIBLE POPULA TIONS 40 | REACHING EVER Y DIS TRICT Organiz e sessions for school age childr en, adolesc ents , and adults . Adolescents: in addition to immunization in schools, develop strategies to reach out-of-school adolesc ents . Adapt strat egies to their ways of living , workplac e programs and informal workplac e settings . Consider special mobilization strat egies for adults , by group . 3: Assess Oppor f or In tegration Numer ous potential oppor tunities exist for integrating additional health services into the vaccination schedule . Review what interventions can be integrated (see Tables 2.1-2.5 in Chapt er 2 \"Considerations for Integration \"). Session plans should contain strat egies to reach populations and can integrate services to immunization, as appr opriat e. Use contac t points at the heath facilit y for curativ e and preventiv e care and at communit y level to identify The WHO Planning Vaccination (MOV ) is intended for use by decision-makers and programme managers at national and sub- national levels. The MOV strat egy includes assessment of the mag nitude and causes of missed oppor tunities (for people visiting health facilities when they are sick and being vaccinat ed and vice-versa), and tailor ed health system interventions to reduc e such missed oppor tunities , leading to an increase in vaccination coverage and timeliness of vaccinations and other health interventions . Deliv er other interventions with immunization (see Tables 2.1-2.5 in Chapt er 2): Add on interventions and referrals according to the criteria described in Chapt er 2 Bring commodities for other interventions during outr each sessions Ensur e systematic referral in \u0000xed sites for other programs Oer all immunizations with other interventions 4: Prepar e, Conduc t, and Monitor S essions There are numer ous steps for preparing , conduc ting , and monit oring immunization sessions . These can be found in Module 5 of WHO's Imm unization in Practice (2015 Update) . Belo w are a few of the key steps: Assign communit y focal points to mobiliz e target population for \u0000xed, outr each and mobile sessions . Take the right quantit y of vaccines and other supplies and maintain vaccines at the proper temperatur es at all times . Assur e the safety of immunization, including reconstitution of vaccines , vaccine administration, discar ding reconstitut ed vaccines within six hours and proper wast e management. Correctly record the doses administ ered on tally sheets , registers, and child and mother cards.CHAPTER 4 | REA CHING ALL ELIGIBLE POPULA TIONS 41 | REACHING EVER Y DIS TRICT Provide caretakers with key information: date, time , and plac e for next immunization, number of visits still needed for the child or a woman. Inform mothers and caretakers about what to do for an Adverse Event Following Immunization. Regularly monitor immunization sessions to assure eective delivery of vaccinations to all eligible populations . 5: Monitor \"Reaching A ll Eligible P opula tions \" The best way to monit or whether all eligible populations are being reached is by measuring vaccination coverage by strat egy: \u0000xed, outr each or mobile .

Engaging with c omm unities r esults in mor e ac commodating and user -friendly ser vices, incr eases utilization and pr omotes ac countabilit y. This chapter describes techniques and appr oaches for engaging with c omm unities . Eective communit y participation is built on partnerships with communities through suppor tive and coordinat ed actions by Distric t Health Management Teams (DHM Ts), health facilit y committ ees, health workers and communit y members . When communities are involved as allies in planning , promoting , implementing and monit oring services, they develop a stronger trust and ownership in the health service. It is ther efore easier for health workers and health planners to analyz e and addr ess reasons for low uptake , drop-out, and underser ved populations when the communities are active partners . Communities are groups of people who shar e common socio -demog raphic charac teristics or living conditions , for example rural villages and urban poor neighborhoods . There are faith-based and ethnic communities and communities which have common practices and livelihoods, such nomadic tribes and \u0000shing communities. Other mobile communities include refugees and internally displac ed people . People who shar e the same socio -economic living standar ds, such as the poor est segment of a population, also make up communities . Communities are not limit ed to people who live in the same plac e. It is impor tant for health managers to recognize communit y dierences and dynamics , and to interac t with the various sections within the communities as well as their in\u0000uenc ers and partners . The sense of \"belong ing\" in a communit y can be a determinant of the likelihood of being vaccinat ed, and immunization acceptanc e or use of services can dier substantially between communities . When some communities have lower immunization uptake , it puts their members at risk, impac ts on herd immunit y and increases the risk of outbr eaks . Communities with low vaccination coverage tend to be disadvantaged in multiple aspec ts that increase the risk of infectious diseases: crowding , lack of safe water, poor sanitation, and geog raphic or economic barriers to accessing health care. 5.1 KEY ISSUESThe poor consist ently have lower vaccination coverage in surveys. Evidenc e has shown that increasing immunization coverage in the poor est communities is cost- eective and generat es mor e health per vaccinat ed child compar ed to vaccinating mor e childr en in bett er o communities . Under-vac cinat ed communities can be identi\u0000ed at national and regional levels through surveys such as DHS, MICs and through equit y assessments (including with local communities). It is impor tant that DHM Ts and health facilit y sta are aware of who the underser ved communities are at national level and apply this knowledge to local planning . Local pro-equit y interventions should be desig ned and implement ed in partnership with the high-risk communities and as an extension of national strat egies and initiativ es to reduc e disparities . Social and beha vior change communication (SBC C) are activities conduc ted with communities which can reinforce positive health practices, discourage dangerous practices and foster community involvement in service delivery such as resource mobilization, integrat ion, and accountability. Eective SBCC is critical for reducing disparities in vaccination between communities . CHAPTER 5 | ENGA GING WITH C OMMUNITIES 45 | REACHING EVER Y DIS TRICT5.2 BUILDING COMMUNIT Y PARTNERSHIPS Eective community par tnerships are based on engaged communities which are suppor ted and facilitat ed by DHM Ts, health facilit y teams and CHW s. Communit y trust and ownership in public services and immunization are fostered when communities are part of the planning , promotion, implementation and monit oring . This is mor e than a local responsibilit y. The roles and responsibilities of the national program, distric t health team, and health workers in linking the communit y with health services should be clearly stated in plans and strat egies at all levels. Engaged communities are bett er positioned to claim their right to vaccination and to hold the health system accountable for the deliv ery of friendly and convenient services. Demand promotion and SBC C are critical activities when engag ing with communities . Some examples include: community dialogue on the value of immunization; mobilization of faith leaders to reach all segments of communities; and collaboration with community-based organizations (CBOs) and schools for disseminating key messages and tracing those in need of vaccination. Communit y engagement activities should be clearly outlined , budget ed and tracked in cMY Ps and national and local level annual work plans . Monit oring and repor ting tools and review meetings should captur e the frequenc y as well as the content and progress of community engagement activities, linking their contributions with improving cove rage, identifying and reaching target populations, and reducing drop-outs. Distric ts need to integrate their communit y engagement activities in the area of immunization with those of other health programs and work closely with locally active NGOs and other partners . Participa tory community mapping is when health workers and communit y members together identify community structures and resources, vulnerable and under- vaccinat ed groups and in\u0000uential communit y members and local leaders . Engag ing in\u0000uential communit y members and leaders for immunization is critical for reaching the unreached and increasing coverage overall. An important practical step in communit y mapping is to list, by name and contac t information (mobile number , address), community members and leaders who can help promote immuni- zation\u2014such as government ocials , traditional healers , businessmen, and opinion leaders as well as contac ts in institutions like schools , faith-based institutions , NGOs , and women 's groups . Visualizing the results on actual maps can be helpful when planning . An example of eective participatory community mapping for reaching every communit y can Participa tory community mappingCHAPTER 5 | ENGA GING WITH C OMMUNITIES 46 | REACHING EVER Y DIS TRICT5.3 BUILDING TRUSTED and FRIENDL Y SER VICES Public trust in vaccination is an immunization program 's most valued asset. Studies in Africa and elsewher e consist ently show that health workers are the most trust ed sour ce of information for caretakers , but they are not the only sour ce. Rumors and misinf ormation about vaccinations can spread quick ly through communit y networks , as well as via mobile phones or media, and over the internet. Frontline health workers need to know well the communities they serve and be prepar ed to respond to their concerns . The interac tion between health workers and caretakers is at the center of maintaining trust. Mothers who are treated respec tfully and who perceive that their childr en's health and safety comes \u0000rst are mor e likely to come back for the next vaccination. Vaccine shor tages , rude reception, lack of inter personal communication, canc elled sessions and closed health facilities are eective ways of losing a communit y's trust. Friendly , convenient, safe and reliable immunization services should be at the center of work plan development and micr o-planning processes . How to maintain trust: Kno w your community and listen to them . If a particular communit y in a catchment area has lower immunization coverage , engage with them and \u0000nd out why. Perhaps they are unaware of the immunization services, or the scheduled times or locations are inconvenient to them. Perhaps they feel left out from the health care system (social distancing), or they may fear immunizations or have incorrect belief s about vaccines . Participa tory dialogue . This requir es regular meetings with the communities to discuss and resolv e issues around planning , possible misc onceptions about vaccines , follow-up of unvaccinat ed and the qualit y of services. Regular mobile phone contac t with the communit y workers and leaders in between meetings ensur es that health facilit y teams are on top of developments . Engage the community . Communities that are actively involved in planning and suppor ting immunization are mor e likely to use the services and to contribut e resour ces. Propose and discuss with communit y members how they can contribut e to impr oving facilit y and outr each sessions . Examples include: Motivating friends , family and neighbors to come for vaccination Arrang ing clean and convenient outr each sites Transpor ting vaccines and health workers to outr each sessions Reminding the communit y about scheduled outr each sessions Helping to keep the communit y register up-to-date Giving health education messages Following-up with caretakers who do not bring their childr en back for immunization 47 | REACHING EVER Y DIS TRICTCHAPTER 5 | ENGA GING WITH C OMMUNITIES5.4 DELIVERING SER VICES t o DISAD VANT AGED C OMMUNITIES Urban poor c ommunities The urban poor is a communit y that often miss out on vaccinations . Although they may live close to health facilities , social distancing and discrimination often prevent them from using their services. Other barriers include unfamiliarit y with the health facilities , lack of trust in authorities , inconvenient service hours and high oppor tunit y costs . Urban poor parents often work long hours away from wher e they live and may have prohibitiv e transpor tation costs to health oers oppor tunities to deliv er immunization. High population densit y means that it is possible to reach man y in a shor t time . Good radio , TV and print ed media coverage are oppor tunities for mass- media promotion of vaccinations . Mobile phone ownership is higher in urban areas, including among the poor , and this opens the possibilit y for SMS alerts, reminders and recalls , and for mor e individualiz ed track ing with caretakers of childr en in need of immunization. Arrang ing alternativ e service hours may be easier in urban areas wher e distanc es are shor ter and wher e ther e is public transpor t. Social mapping with urban poor communities is impor tant and can inform immunization providers about when and wher e caretakers are mor e likely to bring childr en for vaccinations and help with communication strat egy desig n. Health facilit y sta can engage with partners in immunization, such as faith-based organizations , health care and social service providers , schools , privat e sector, humanitarian organization and communit y volunt eer networks , to identify and understand the beha vioral and social determinants of the urban poor communit y. Refugees and In ternally Displac ed P eople Every child and adult in distric t and health facilit y catchment areas should be immuniz ed. Do not leave out unexpec ted or newly established communities , such as camps and settlements for refugees and internally displac ed people . Populations who are displac ed by emer gencies are at increased risk of VPDs and should be prioritiz ed for vaccinations regar dless of their orig in or reason for arriving in the area. The DHM Ts and health facilities need to coordinat e the work with partners assisting the displac ed communities and make sure that they have access to vaccine and vaccination supplies as needed , and that immunizations are administ ered safely and correctly recor ded . All relevant partners should be involved in the planning , implementation, and monit oring of immunization services. Mobile popula tions Mobile communities such as past oralist herdsmen, hunt ers, and \u0000shing communities may not be accessible at all times of the year or may turn up unexpec tedly in the catchment area. They can easily be missed during work planning unless their movements are known and predic table .

This includes scheduling regular meetings and , wher ever possible , frequent mobile phone c ontac t. Communit y representativ es and CHW s should be in vited t o the health facilit y micr o-planning sessions . The health facilit y team should also engage with other communit y struc tures that can suppor t immunization service deliv ery, such as health extension agents for nutrition, HIV/AIDS, TB, and malaria, as well as communit y health committ ees, schools , local media, women 's groups , groups , organizations , and the privat e sector. CHW s often have multiple responsibilities and may have competing priorities based on their sour ces of compensation or training . The involvement of CHW s in immunization service deliv ery, including super vision and coordination, should be part of micr o-planning . Communit y health committ ees can be used to suppor t this process. CHW s should be able to understand and communicat e the information on the home -based vaccination cards. CHW s, health extension workers , communit y mobiliz ers and health volunt eers can assist with: Providing caretakers with correct information on the impor tanc e of vaccines and vaccination schedule Identifying and entering pregnant women, newborns and childr en < 5 years of age in communit y registers Generating \"due lists\" and track ing people in need of vaccinations and inform health facilities about missed childr en and missed communities Arrang ing and conduc ting home visits as needed Assisting with the organization of outr each sessions and mobile clinics Promoting demand and encourag ing caretakers to attend immunization sessions Community r egisters Community registers of pregnant women and childr en up to 5 years of age are impor tant for keeping track of the eligible population and for achieving high coverage with vaccinations and other scheduled health interventions . Health facilit y teams should work closely with CHW s to keep the communit y registers up to date and use them to recall and track childr en and pregnant women who are due for vaccination. Health facilities should link and compar e these registers with the existing immunization or child health register and track ing system at the facilit y and ensur e that recorded vaccinations for individual childr en and mothers correspond with home -based records and the information in the communit y registers. The registers should record contac t information (such as mobile phone numbers , village/addr ess, and name of responsible CHW ) that allow for track ing and recalling unvaccinat ed childr en and those due for services. 49 | REACHING EVER Y DIS TRICTCHAPTER 5 | ENGA GING WITH C OMMUNITIES5.6 USING EFFEC TIVE C OMMUNIC ATION Eective communication is based on dialogue and respec t.

Plan sit e visits4.b 4.a 4.c Steps RED Tool Suppor tive super vision is a pr ocess of helping sta to impr ove their o wn w ork per formanc e continuously . It is carried out in a r espec tful and non- authoritarian w ay with a focus on using super visor y visits as an oppor tunit y to impr ove knowledge and sk ills of health sta . Suppor tive super vision enc ourages open, t wo-way c omm unic ation , and building team approaches that facilitate pr oblem-solving . It focuses on monit oring per formanc e to wards goals , and using data for decision- mak ing, and depends upon r egular follo w-up with sta to ensur e that new tasks ar e being implemented correctly. 6.1 KEY ISSUES Super vision is a key func tion of management and is process of continuous assessment and impr ovement. It can be done by using self-assessment, interac tions with peers or super visors through remot e means , and review meetings , as well as the in-person visit by a super visor . Health workers can use analytical super vision tools to continuously monit or their performanc e. When done well, suppor tive super vision catalyz es the eective deliv ery of immunization services. It requir es experienc ed sta who are trained in both immunization and as suppor tive super visors . Such super visors are able to routinely assess sta performanc e and system func tioning in a non-thr eatening manner and identify problems on-sit e, such as low coverage or high dropout rates, and cold chain and wast e disposal de\u0000ciencies . ess system provide on-sit e capacit y building to impr ove sta performanc e or addr ess gaps in knowledge and skills. Not all de\u0000ciencies can be solv ed at the service deliv ery level. Therefore another role of suppor tive super visors is to serve as a liaison with distric t, provincial , and national managers to make them aware of needed suppor t and follow-up to impr ove local performanc e. This may be through the provision of essential commodities , job aids , in-ser vice training , and exchange visits . Suppor tive super visors also can help instill a sense of accountabilit y among service providers for implementing EPI as planned and serving the communit y. Ideally , suppor tive super vision can lead to a bett program and ther efore mor e fully-immuniz ed en and women. 5.

Suppor tive super vision adds mor e to traditional super vision by emphasizing the following: On-site capacity building to answ er health workers' questions , correct problems before they become major obstacles , and provide on-going refresher training for health workers; Participa tory per through interac tive and non-thr eatening dialogue with the health worker ; Documen tation regular and construc tive feedback ; Appr tely scheduled visits , according to the health facilit y's workload and to avoid inconveniencing the health sta , mothers or caretakers; Applica tion of the \u0000ndings from super visor y visits in micr o-planning and strat egy development. See Tools 4a, 4b, and 4c in the Annex. Supportive supervision can also be enhanced by additional performance impr ovement strat egies, such as those listed in Resour ces at the end of this chapt er, and those described in WHO MLM module 4, WHO AFRO MLM Module 21. 6.2 MAKING SUPER VISION SUPPORTIVE Suppor tive super vision involves obser vation of performanc construc tive en feedback . It includes collaborative problem-solving between the supervisor and the health worker, and with the communit y. To be eective, super visors need to have good technical and obser vational skills, as well as good interpersonal communication skills. Where integrated supervision is in place, the district should train super visors in all of the necessar y PHC areas. Dev eloping trust between the super visor and health sta is essential . 6.3 PLANNING AND C ONDUC TING SUPPORTIVE SUPER VISION Use these \u0000v e steps when planning and c onduc ting suppor tive super vision: 1. Prepar e for the super vision Decide whether the super vision will be speci\u0000c to EPI or integr ated. If you conduc t integrated super vision, determine the most critical factors to review during the visit for each health intervention. It is impor tant not to overload your visit with too man y items , such that the visit becomes rushed , only to complet e a very long check list. On the other hand , you do not want to exclude any critical areas that must be checked . Refer to national guidelines about the type of suppor tive super vision to conduc t. Super vision is mor e eective and mor e frequent when indicat ors are streamlined and prioritiz ed. It is mor e cost- eective when funding for super vision is coordinat ed with other health interventions . Ideally , integrated super vision involves super visors experienc ed in multiple interventions who have technical exper tise in mor e than one area. Sending several super visors , each with exper tise in only one intervention, may not be the most ecient or the most produc tive use of a health worker's or super visors' time . 54 | REACHING EVER Y DIS TRICTCHAPTER 6 | C ONDUC TING SUPPOR TIVE SUPERVISIONIntegrated super vision needs t o be w ell-planned and timed so that the int erventions ar e assessed adequat ely and without disruption to health services or inconvenienc e to mothers and caretakers . The distric t health team must determine how man y interventions/ser vices can be eectively assessed during a single visit. Health workers can only internaliz e a limit ed number of recommendations . If a length y list of areas to addr ess is the result of a super visor y visit, it will be disc ourag ing and demoralizing to the health worker . More frequent, focused feedback is key to assuring performanc e impr ovement. 2. Iden impor tant to assig n super vision to well-trained sta with good \u0000eld experienc e and rappor t with health workers . At national , regional , provincial or distric t levels, suppor tive super vision should be conduc ted at least quar terly . Ideally , health facilities should be visit ed mon thly . Remember: super vision is continuous . Health workers can routinely assess health facilit y performanc e through self-super vision. They should not wait for the next visit from the distric t oc er to assess their performanc e or reveal problems with service deliv ery. (See Tool 4.b in the Annex and Section 6.1 abo ve.} 3. Prepar e tools & check lists Super vision without a check list will not be eective; it can be revised depending on the situation. The check list includes some of the following items: qualit y of vaccine , supply management, and the cold chain; immunization service performanc e, such as measles coverage , and dropout rates; service deliv ery, such as planned versus conduc ted sessions and missed oppor tunities , available human ce and capacit y, data qualit y issues , the manner in which health workers treat clients and communit y engagement activities . An eective super vision tool guides sta through a construc tive, participat ory process aimed at identifying problems and w eaknesses and at measuring pr ogress. It allo ws national , provincial , and distric t teams t o track indicat ors of service deliv ery and ther eby make decisions on corrective actions , training needs , and issues for updating micr o-plans . Review and follow up on the recommendations from previous super vision visits . (See Tool 4.a in the Annex for a generic suppor tive super vision tool.) 4. Plan site visits Plan/prioritiz e wher e to go: When human and \u0000nancial resour ces are limit ed; prioritiz e visits according to those facilities needing the most help , such as those serving high-risk communities . Do not limit your super vision only to the near est facilities . Inform the super visee of the date and time of super vision; be sure to let the health facilit y know when you are coming . Plan your super vision schedule together . 5. Conduc t construc tive visits Suppor tive super vision is not an evaluation or an exam for the health worker , but rather a mutual understanding on the impor tanc e of the standar ds necessar y for high qualit y services. It is impor tant for the super visor and health workers to discuss the standar ds and the super vision tool. Agree upon the most critical areas and 55 | REACHING EVER Y DIS TRICTCHAPTER 6 | C ONDUC TING SUPPOR TIVE super vision Introduc tion of the team to the health facility : the super vision team should introduc e itself to the in- char ge of the health facilit y and when feasible ask the in-char ge to join the team. Obser vation of services: the team should obser ve services without interruption of the service and in a way not aecting the privac y of clients . Exit interview of caretak ers: a minimum of \u0000ve caretakers should be interview ed after vaccination. Interview/dialogue with the super visee : use the check list for the interview and provide feedback to the super visee on what you obser ved. Acknowledge good performanc e and correct errors in techniques and procedur es in privat e. Provide verbal feedback/on-the-job training/mentoring: Provide on-the-job capacity building, including skill-building and updating on curr ent policies and technolog ies, and identify futur e training needs for sta . Visit the community : when time and capacit y permits , the super visor and the health center sta should visit high-risk communities in the health center's catchment area. They should discuss with the communit y leaders and communit y members about immunization and obser ve their perception of the immunization service. Health center sta should apply their feedback to impr ove services. When feasible the super vision team should identify and visit a priorit y communit y and conduc t house -to-house visits of houses with 10 childr en of 0-23 months old and assess their vaccination status . Provide written feedback : Document obser vations and suggest ed follow-up actions in a super vision logbook . See Tool 4.a for a generic suppor vision format. Shar e obser vations and \u0000ndings : Discuss the results of suppor tive super vision visits with the DHM T at every oppor tunit y, such as routine sta meetings and review meetings . Knowledge of the needs and obstacles for deliv ering immunizations by the local administration and communit y can lead to increased suppor t for the health facilit y. Conduc ting in ternal suppor tive super vision a t health facilities Suppor tive super vision at a health facilit y can be conduc ted internally by the facilit y health management team members , including the in-char ges of the health facilities and the Qualit y Impr ovement (QI) team, if any. The facilit y health management team can suppor t and motivat e health care providers; provide training and recognition to sta ; form and build teams and promot e team-based appr oaches to problem-solving; foster trust and open communication; and collec t and use data for decision-mak ing. In addition, they can ensur e that follow-up actions recommended by distric t super visors are implement ed. Conduc ting suppor tive super vision a t the c ommunity le vel The suc cess of c ommunit w orkers ( CHW s) is dir ectly tied t o the training , suppor t and super vision they receive. Therefore, the health facilit y in-char ge and the relevant focal persons should ensur e that suppor tive super vision is also provided at the communit y level. This can be conduc ted on a monthly basis or as the need arises , and the super visor should act as a ment or, advocat e, and counselor to the CHW . During each super visor y visit, the HF team pays a courtesy call to the village leader , such as Village Executiv e Ocer, then meet with a CHW to review their work, discuss their needs and upcoming events , provide feedback on how the program is progressing , and problem-solv e any issues that have come up. Such visits can include a review of standar d operating procedures (SOPs), equipment and supplies, service delivery based on guidelines, patient satisfac tion, training needs , referral systems and communit y linkages . 56 | REACHING EVER Y DIS TRICTCHAPTER 6 | C ONDUC TING SUPPOR TIVE SUPERVISION6.4 CORE INDIC ATOR FOR SUPPORTIVE SUPER VISION Super visor y visits should be as regular and frequent as resour ces allow, in accordanc e with national policies .

An eective programme monit oring system reinforces accountabilit y of those who contribut e to its implementation. A programme can be monit ored by using a combination of passiv e ollec tion (standar dized ollec tion (super visor y visits). Distric t and health facilit y sta need to continuously generat e and collec t a \u0000ow of reliable information that describes the qualit y and eectiveness of their health services, in order to make informed decisions on the direction of programme strat egies (see Figur e 7.1 belo w). Rather than wait for an annual review or work planning , sta should be aware on an ongoing basis if their performanc e is on track . Quar terly or monthly review s can investigat e a range of issues . For example , are targets being achiev ed? Are the unreached being reached? Ar e strat egies Is ther e con\u0000denc e that injec tions ar e being g iven saf ely? What ar e the bottlenecks to reaching targets: dropout rates, missed oppor tunities , vaccine stock-outs? ac tion Figure 7.1: STEPS IN EPI MONIT ORING & USING DATA FOR ACTION DATA COLLECTION & REC ORDING DATA REC ORDING DATA ANAL IDENTIFIC DEVEL OPING SOLUTIONS PUBLIC HEAL TH ACTION MONIT ORING & USING D ATA FOR A CTION 60 | REACHING EVER Y DIS TRICTCHAPTER 7 | MONIT ORING & USING D ATA FOR A CTION Often, managers consider only their own program 's repor ting needs . As a consequenc e, combining all repor ting requir ements for all health programs , distr ict and health facilit y sta can lead to sta being overbur dened with forms and data. Because of this, health workers lose sight of the impor tanc e of using the information which they are collec ting . Active and eective monit oring requir es selec ting only the most essential information for management that can be used and analyz ed to impr ove programme strat egies. Examples of essential information for immunization include: vaccinations given by location and by deliv ery strat egy, dropout rates, and immunization sessions held versus planned . The accurac y and eectiveness of monit oring is greatly in\u0000uenc ed by the choic e of measur ement indicat ors, and the qualit y of data collec tion. Data for indicat ors should be easy to collec t, easy to understand and linked to corrective actions . Atten tion to repor ts and to better informa tion . When sta who compile repor ts know that their work is impor tant and is being used by managers , qualit y impr oves. When up-to-date information is visually displa yed, and when super visors review, cross- check and provide feedback on reported versus recorded information and discuss health facility reports, the quality of information can impr ove. The \u0000ve RED components provide a useful framew ork to help organiz e and struc ture the monit oring of core indicat ors selec ted for reviewing programme performanc e. Supplementar y indicat ors may be used depending on countr y context. The monit oring tools used and the appr oach should be standar dized, but also remain \u0000exible and adapt to national , distric t and local situations . 61 | REACHING EVER Y DIS TRICTCHAPTER 7 | MONIT ORING & USING D ATA FOR A CTION 7.2 THE MONIT ORING FOR A CTION PROCESS There are \u0000ve major steps to immunization programme monit oring . Based on the national polic y and standar ds, the distric t health management team and health facilities can desig n a monit oring process that will be eective for their distric t. This can be accomplished during micr o-planning . Jointly decide with health workers the most eective appr oach and persons responsible at distric t, health facilit y and communit y levels, according to human and \u0000nancial resour ces. Dev elop a schedule that includes a monthly review of process indic ators (sessions conduc ted per plan, stock -outs , for example), per formanc e indica tors (coverage , dropout rates, and ered/ vac cine , doses g iven the same time , etc.). Time should be allocat ed for development and monit oring of coverage impr ovement plans at least quar terly for those facilities or areas in need . Today, immunization programs operat e in a rapidly chang ing environment. They have gone well beyond only measuring immunization coverage , which is heavily reliant on the accurac y of denominat ors. In addition to adding new vaccines , programs now focus mor e on speci\u0000c qualit y issues and targeting the under-ser ved. Consequently , ther e is mor e variation in indicat ors for monit oring . Although targets and indicat ors are usually set at the national level, distric t and health workers should review their targets and indicat ors and decide how and when targets will be achiev ed. A limit ed number of core indicat ors (process, performanc e or qualit y) can be chosen to measur e key activities over time and reinforce performanc e standar ds. This helps managers make bett er and mor e focused decisions , without over-bur dening service providers with data collec tion. In certain settings , it may also be useful to selec t supplemental indicat ors that can be tracked . Core indicat ors measur e critical immunization processes for adjusting service deliv ery strat egies, strengthening communit y linkages , \u0000ne -tuning logistics , and updating micro-plans. Supplemental indicators measure additional aspects of the programme that may enable good performanc e, or that may be showing levels of integration with immunization (e.g., exist ence of writt en guidelines , levels of TT2+ and antenatal care). Although progress against indicat ors is monit ored by super visors , the same indicat ors can also be used for \"self-assessment \" by health facilities and distric t health teams . Table 7.1 belo w gives examples of core indicat ors and performanc e standar ds expec ted of each of the RED components , and the suggest ed frequenc y of collec tion. The intent is to stimulat e national and distric t health management teams to use and adapt those indicat ors that are most relevant locally . 1: De\u0000ne The Monitoring Process 2: S elec t Indica tors and Targets 62 | REACHING EVER Y DIS TRICTCHAPTER 7 | MONIT ORING & USING D ATA FOR A CTION Planning and managemen t of resour ces with a similar skill le vel Reaching A ll Eligible Popula tions Stock out of vac cines , diluent, or syringes in the past month Stock out of tally sheets , immunization r egisters, immunization car ds, or other EPI tools in the past month Functional r efrigerat or with normal temperatur e ranges r ecorded in past month EPI micr o-plan updat ed (quar terly) Received operation or immunization ac tivities on time (quar terly) At least 80% of planned sessions were conduc ted in pr evious monthHealth F acility Indica tors RED C omponen t % of HFs in distric t with st of an y vac cines , diluent, or syringes in past month % of HFs in distric t with st ock-outs of tally sheets , registers, immunization car ds, or other EPI tools in the past month % of HFs in distric t with func tional refrigerat ors with normal temperatur e ranges r the past HFs in distric t receiving disbursed operation funds f or immunization ac tivities on time (quar terly) At least 80% of planned sessions in all HFs in distric t were conduc ted in previous month Activit y plan f or outr each immunization sessions in all HFs in distric t is updat ed annuallyDistric t Engaging with C ommunities Conduc ting Suppor tive Super vision Document ed meeting at the communit y lev el held monthly Received at least one suppor tive super vision visit fr om the distric t with writt en feedback per quar ter Document ed meeting at the communit y lev el held monthly % of all HFs in distric t receiving at least one suppor tive super vision visit with writt en feedback per quar ter Monitoring and U sing Da ta for A ction Coverage of P enta1, P enta3, and MCV reached at least 90% f or each antigen in the pr evious month Drop-out rat e of P enta1-P enta3 less than 10% f or pr evious month Immunization monit oring char t is up-to-date, accurat e, and visibly displa yed Coverage of P enta1, P enta3, and MCV reached at least 90% f or each antigen in the pr evious month \u00b7 Drop-out rat e of P enta1-P enta3 less than 10% f or pr evious month r eview meeting conduc ted for HF staTable 7.1: EXAMPLES OF CORE INDIC ATORS FOR RED COMPONENTS FOR HEAL TH FACILITIES AND DISTRICTS 63 | REACHING EVER Y DIS TRICTCHAPTER 7 | MONIT ORING & USING D ATA FOR A CTION Figure 7.2.

It illustrat es progress on reducing dropout from immunization and in reducing the childr en \"left out\" from immunization services. In areas with poor qualit y data, one can monit or the number of childr en immuniz ed compar ed to the total number of childr en from health facilit y records who need to be immuniz ed, rather than by coverage rates (%). This char t provides a constant, up-to-date reminder for sta on how well they are doing on reaching their target. It is also a good tool for discussing with the health team about the changes needed to impr ove the eectiveness of immunization services, including default er track ing (see \"Imm unization in Practice,\" eam/10665/193412/1/9789241549097_eng .pdf ). Using data for action in a meaningful way requir es that the repor ting is timely , complet e and accurat e. Impr ovements can only be achiev ed through regular review and analy sis of repor ted data and active use and feedback of the data collec ted. 65 | REACHING EVER Y DIS TRICTCHAPTER 7 | MONIT ORING & USING D ATA FOR A CTION Monitoring data for action is a participatory approach invo lving the district health management team, health facilities , communities and partners who routinely review and discuss the programme information and its interpretation. Information that is only collec ted, compiled , and sent up t o the nex t hierar chical lev el and then put a way in a \u0000le is not useful for taking action. Eective monit oring involves regular analy sis and participat ory feedback with health sta , partners , local ocials and communities . Communities that actively participat e in planning and monit oring are mor e likely to assist with impr oving access and utilization of health services. At distric t level, review of process, performanc e and data qualit y indicat ors is impor tant to do at least every quar ter. The best way to impr ove the validit y of data is for the distric t and health facilit y sta to continuously and critically review the information which they are collec ting and repor t obser vations or concerns to higher levels. 4: Analy se and Interpr et Data When the information is being analy sed, it is impor tant to identify the problem causing the poor outcome . Asking multiple layers of questions based on the immunization data can help identify the underlying reasons or 'root- cause' behind why ther e are performanc e gaps . Ask questions and discuss potential solutions about \u0000ndings , such as: If you are not reaching your targets , what are the critical reasons or root causes? How and who can correct these problems? What are the local solutions? Are ther e communities without access to health services? If so, how can they be reached? Are ther e communities or groups who are not fully utilizing the available services? Why? What additional available resour ces are needed to implement solutions? Which areas, groups , communities are at highest risk for low coverage? Are cold chain and supply management adequat e for meeting the demand? How can you revise your micr o-plan to bett er \u0000t the \u0000ndings from your active monit oring? Including others such as c ommunit y leaders representativ es, NGOS, and CBOs , in the review and discussion about the \u0000ndings leads to bett er strat egies and eective solutions . ? ? ? ? ? ?? ? 66 | REACHING EVER Y DIS TRICTCHAPTER 7 | MONIT ORING & USING D ATA FOR A CTION Once immunization data has been review ed and a root- cause analysis is conduc ted, potential solutions can be discussed among the team. The appr opriat e actions that need to be taken should be discussed collaborativ ely and an action plan draf ted. This \u0000nal step is about linking data analy sis to prac tical , actionable interventions . The ac tion plan is a simple wa y to describe ac tions , name r esponsible par ties, set timelines and track progress. The speed at which actions are taken depend on a combination of the seriousness of the problem and the ease of implementing solutions . 5: Take Action and Upda te the Micr o-Plan Tools in the Annex f or monit oring and using data f or ac tion: 67 | REACHING EVER Y DIS TRICTTool 5a: Monit oring Char t Tool 1f Analy sis Optional Tool: D ue List Tool: My Village , My Home Optional Tool: Defaulter Tracing Tool: Monitoring ession helps conduc t a root- cause analy sis to identify the causes of problems .

OPER ATIONAL C ONSIDER ATIONS WHEN IMPLEMENTING RED 8.1 THE MONIT ORING FOR A CTION PROCESS RED is not a separat e plan in itself and should ideally be embedded in distric t and health facilit y planning processes to build upon what already works . The RED tools and examples are not exhaustiv e or prescriptiv e and can be consider ed as a menu to be adapt ed and used as needed . They can be adapt ed to local contexts when addr essing inequities by increasing access and utilization of immunization and other MNCH services. This RED guide and related tools can be used alongside WHO and WHO AFRO's Immunization in Practice (IIP), Immunization Training for Mid-Level Managers (MLM), and Immunization Supply Chain and Management (ISCM) resour ces. Training oppor tunities should be consider ed for adapting to local contexts and selec ting tools that could strengthen immunization systems . Operationalizing the RED appr oach and tools needs an enabling environment, which requir es suppor t from communities, health workers, district managers, province and national ocials. Drawing attention to discr epancies in data, high-risk populations needs , communities facing geog raphical barriers help advocat e for resour ces during the planning process. Resour ces ar e mainly domestic and need close c ollaboration with br oader health planners and \u0000nanciers . The RED appr oach t ools c ould also be an attrac tive investment GA VI's Health S ystems Str engthening (HSS) portfolio . The RED appr oach ther efore to be part of the regular national , provinc e, distric t and health facilit y planning and resour ce allocation processes , including a countr y's \u0000ve-year planning cycle, annual planning , or monthly activit y planning processes . If used eectively, the RED appr oach and tools can help prioritiz e resour ce allocation for high-risk communities and geog raphic areas. The process can also encourage dialogue about mor e ecient use of existing resour ces and strategies. This includes leveraging resources from other pro-equity approaches such as Periodic Intensi\u0000cation of Routine Immunization (PIRI), Child Health Weeks/Da ys, and vaccination campaig ns. The RED appr oach can be an impor tant part of plans and measles-rubella contr ol eorts, deliv ering vaccines in mor e sustainable ways. 8.2 ACCOUNT ABILIT Y, LEADERSHIP AND O WNERSHIP Implementing the RED appr oach and tools requir es accountabilit y to communities and strong leadership at all levels to provide an enabling environment focused on the needs of high-risk populations . Accountabilit y to communities needs active participation by key communit y stakeholders and encourag ing their participation in planning , implementing and monit oring services. Other aspec ts of accountabilit y are highlight ed in the Addis Declaration on Immunization that ensur es that partners are contributing to well-r ecognized Government plans and targets and not duplicating eorts. Authorities need to be engaged at national , distric t, health facilit y and communit y levels. Good leadership encourages ownership by involving managers of other PHC programs , key distric t and communit y leaders , and partners in planning , resour ce mobilization, and budgeting . Ownership in turn promot es transpar ency and accountability, which are critical for obtaining resources. Community ownership and health facility transpar ency are also impor tant in areas wher e the population may be losing interest or trust in immunization CHAPTER 8 | OPER ATIONAL C ONSIDER ATIONS WHEN IMPLEMENTING RED 70 | REACHING EVER Y DIS TRICT8.3 COORDINA TION Coordination among Ministr y of Health programs , such as immunization, malaria, nutrition, and mat ernal health, and also with the communit y, leads to a mor e cost- eective and mor e sustainable healthcar e system. It is also impor tant to coordinat e with donors , NGOs and communities to maximiz e and not duplicat e eorts. Coordination goes beyond the health sector to other sectors such as Ministries of Financ e, Social Welfar e, Agricultur e, Education, Cultur e and Spor ts, as well as the privat e sector. Such coordination with other sectors is needed at all administrativ e levels, including the distric t and health facilit y levels. 8.4 LOGISTICS (& iSCM AND TRANSPORT ) Logistics includes: planning, procurement, and delivering vaccines and supplies; and managing and maintaining transpor t and cold chain equipment. RED ener gizes strengthening all of the components of an immunization program. Successful immunization services also depend on eective and ecient logistics , including: accurat e forecasting , ordering , storage and distribution of vaccines and vaccination supplies , and other health services supplies such as: Vitamin A, de-worming medication, and ITNs reliable cold and dry store management availabilit y of transpor tation for outr each for each health facilit y maint enanc e and repair of transpor t and cold chain equipment safe management of injec tion and biomedical wast e These needs are interlinked and reinforced throughout all of the \u0000ve RED components . For example , your cold chain strat egy needs very careful attention during your situational analy sis and strat egy development during Micro-Planning . The reliabilit y of your cold chain depends on continuous and accurat e Monitoring for Action . By Communit y Engagement and Reaching the Target Popula tion you can extend the cold chain to unreached communities and target groups . Regular Suppor tive Super vision detects your cold chain and supply management problems before they disrupt your program. 8.5 COMMUNIC ATION Communication strat egies integrated into other health services can be mor e eective in reaching your target audienc es. Communication with partners should be included in RED planning and implementation. Your immunization team needs exper tise in communication. They should work with communication professionals , including communication program managers , multimedia and advertising specialists , communit y leaders , as well as exper scienc e and beha vior change . Eective communication relies on a strategic approach based on community engagement, social mobilization, social behavior change, health worker capacity building, and advocacy.
