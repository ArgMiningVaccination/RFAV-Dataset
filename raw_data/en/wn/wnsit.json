Our medical doctors are experts in full spectrum care using a natural approach. Patients come in for a variety of issues including joint pain, chronic conditions, and issues specific to men's and women's health. Our naturopathic doctors provide expert, compassionate care in testing, diagnosis, and effective evidence-based treatments, personalized treatment plans to meet each patient's unique needs. We offer treatments, therapies and naturopathic medicine to facilitate natural healing for immediate needs, and comprehensive programs to optimize your health over time. Our doctors take the time to hear your story so they can fully understand what you're dealing with, and develop accurate, holistic diagnoses that identify the underlying factors causing your pain or illness. We often help people who have not found relief with other treatments. Our naturopathic doctors help restore pain-free joint function and restore balance in immune, digestive and hormone systems, which often improves both immediate physical symptoms and also improves cognition and emotional stability. We emphasize natural and holistic interventions and lifestyle changes, and take advantage of the full palette of care options from traditional remedies to modern science. We collaborate with experts in a wide range of health disciplines, including physical therapists and specialist doctors, referring patients as needed to ensure the most effective care possible.

[Joint Pain Treatments](https://www.naturopathicgroup.com/conditions/joint-pain/) Are you looking to treat a joint condition caused by a sports injury, accident, work injury, chronic issues, an autoimmune condition, or age-related joint-tissue degradation? People often try many different joint-pain treatments without relief. Our doctors offer treatment with a progression of regenerative therapies. The therapies included in individualized treatment plans depend on how severe the damage is. Treatment plans are designed to help repair and may fully restore damaged joint tissues. [Whole Health Treatments](https://www.naturopathicgroup.com/about-us/whole-health-philosophy/) Patients come to our naturopathic doctors with a range of conditions: digestive, respiratory, sleep, sinus, circulation, mental, immune response, thyroid, weight management, allergy and endocrine/hormone problems. Many come for regular check-ups and to make sure they are doing what they can to stay healthy and avoid disease. Treating whole-health conditions includes nutritional advice, natural supplements, and in many cases homeopathy, botanical and functional medicine, bioidentical hormones, and vitamin therapies. The use of medical treatments discussed on this site require evaluation, laboratory testing, and consideration of the risks, benefits, and other options before they are employed. No offer is being made for any treatment without undergoing a comprehensive health evaluation and discussion about the nature of the evidence for a therapeutic approach and the risks/benefits inherent for each individual. Therapies may be designed to strengthen your immune system to reduce the risk and intensity of infectious and inflammatory diseases rather than as specific treatments for diseases including the coronavirus that causes COVID-19 as there are no FDA approved treatments or cures for COVID-19 at this time.
