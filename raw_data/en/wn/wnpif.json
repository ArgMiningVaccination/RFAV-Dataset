A cross sectional national survey was conducted in 20 out of 2 5 districts in Sri Lanka. From each district one to six Medical O fficer of Health Area s (MOH) was randomly selected according to the size of the population and one Child Welfare Clinic from each MOH w as randomly selected. Altogether 36 child welfare clinics were selected. About 25 children aged 6-60 months were randomly selected in each clinic; a total of 9 00 children were included in the study. Data on socio -demographic, nutrition and dietary consumption was obtained by interview ing mother or principle caregiver. Blood samples were collected from each child and their mothers. HPLC method was used to analyse serum retinol concentration. VAD (95% CI: 26.1 %-32.5%) aged 6 severe VAD (serum -3.4%) of . Prevalence 26.2% -32.9%) . The prevalence of VAD in children was significantly higher in the presence of respiratory tract infections during the past 2 weeks prior to the survey. Overall, 66% of mothers reported that their children had received a vitamin A supplement at least once. The prevalence of VAD was 23.9% just after the vitamin A supplementation and 34%, six months after the supplementation. Mean retinol concentration was 2 4.8\u00b5g/L and the highest with the children just after the vitamin A supplementation. In this study 62.3% of the survey population have been consum ing vitamin A rich animal food items on more than 4 days per week and 61.3% have been c onsum ing vitamin A rich animal and vegetable food sources on more than 6 days per week. It indicates the average consumption of vitamin A rich food items has not yet reached the acceptable level of 70% which indicat es VAD is still a public health problem in this survey population . In non - pregnant women from 15 to 49 years the percentage of women with retinol concentrations < 20\u00b5g/L was 14 .9% (95% CI: 10.7% -19.4%) . Vitamin A status report 2006 5 The results of the survey have shown that VAD is still a serious public health problem in children from 6 to 59 mon ths of age in Sri Lanka as 29.3% of children have plasma retinol concentrations 20\u00b5g/L. It is recommended to reduce the gap between two doses of Vitamin A mega dose and to repeat the supplementation every 6 months and to start at 6 months till 5 years. It is necessary to promote the consum ption of more vitamin A rich food among children and women.

Vitamin A Deficiency (VAD) is a public health concern in most developing countries, especially in Africa and South -East Asia. Ch ildren and pregnant women in low - income countries are most severely affected by VAD. Statistics show that , globally, there are betw een 140 and 250 million children under the age of 5 years who suffer from VAD. They are at increased risk of blindness and complication s from diseases associated with VAD such as diarrhoea and measles. As many as 8 million children die from VAD related conditions each year, most of them in their first year of life (WHO 2003 ). In pregnant women from high risk backgrounds, VAD is especially prevalent in the last trimester when the demand for vitamin A by the foetus and the mother is at the highest. Deficiency is expressed as night blindness during this period. An excessive intake of vitamin A, generally from over -supplementatio n, may be implicated in congenital defects, though further research is needed. It is imperative that supplementation programs be tailored to the needs of the population to avoid toxicity. GLOBAL PROBLEM OF VITAMIN A Vitamin A deficiency remains a widespre ad public health problem among women and children. Over 20 percent of all preschool age children (about 130 million) and nearly six percent of all pregnant women (about 7 million) suffer from vitamin A deficiency and its adverse health consequences (West, 2002; Rice et al, 2004). The majority of vitamin A deficient women and children currently live in South Asia or Sub -Saharan Africa, in the same countries where vitamin A supplementation programmes for children over six months of age have helped reduce high child mortality rates. But while more than 60 countries now have supplementation programmes of preschool age children, only few have launched large scale programme s to address the problem among younger infants and women of reproductive age. Vitamin A status report 2006 10 SRI LANKA CO NTEXT Sri Lanka is an island situated in the Indian Ocean, between 5 and 10 degrees latitude in the Northern Hemisphere. The population of 2 0 million is distributed equitably around the country, which is divided administratively into 9 Provinces and 25 Dis tricts. Sri Lanka is classified as a developing country, with Gross Domestic Product ( GDP ) per capita per annum at approximately US$ 40001. The reported child (under 5 years) mortality rate is 18 per 1000 live births2\u00a7 and 23% of the country's population i s below the age of 15 years. TRENDS AND INTERVENTIONS CARRIED OUT IN THE PAST IN SRI LANKA Sri Lanka had reduced the prevalence of Keratomalacia as a cause of blindness in children from 60% in 1930 , 44.04% in 1940 , 28.6% in 1950 , 7% in 1960 and 0.2% in 1970 as results of the various intervention programme carried out in the past (Jayatissa 2005) . In the late 1940s, retinol palmitate added non fat dried milk was freely made available to every child from 1 year to 5 years , to be fed on site or at home, dep ending on the available service s through the Maternal and Child Health ( MCH ) programme , to protect children against Keratomalacia . Another programme was executed by CARE through the US PL480 programme for all pregnant, lactating women and all primary schoo l children were fed at school or at home . The programme went on for 16 years from the 1950s to 1970 at a cost of a billion (Jayatissa 2005) In 1962, Vitamin A content of breast milk of lower and middle income lactating mothers at the hospital settings ind icated the low retinol level of low income mothers in the 3 -5th days of lactation with the middle income lactating ( 45.0\u00b5g 17.4 and 44.8 \u00b5g 25.48 respectively ). Of which the di fference was found to be significant (p < 0.05) on the later part of the week. The availability of vitamin A in the hospital diet was only 43% due to the unavailability of milk and the lactating mothers of the rural poor had an intake of 16%. This was due to low in take of animal foods. However in the global , local food and fuel crisis in 197 0, US PL480 programme was withdrawn and Keratomalacia came back again in 19 71. As shown in Table 1.1, 381,079 children 1 - 6 years of age in 4 of the worst affected Pr ovinces were examined for clinical Vitamin A status report 2006 11 signs of Vitamin A deficiency and indicated the prevalence of Keratomalacia (>0.01) and Bitot's spots (>0.5) were public health significance (De mel 1970) . Table 1.1 Prevalence of clinical signs of Vitamin A deficiency prior to distribution of Vitamin A Mega dose by provinces in 1971/2 Provinces No of children aged 13 -72 months Bitot's spots No. (%) Night Blindness No. (%) Kerato malacia No. (%) CENTRAL 100,936 125 (0.1) 23 (0.02) 04 (0.004) SABARAGAMUWA 101,352 860 (0.8) 313 (0.3) 24 (0.02) SOUTHERN 130,791 877 (0.7) 235 (0.2) 30 (0.02) EASTERN 48,000 496 (1.0) 325 (0.7) 1 (0.002) TOTAL 381,0 79 2,358 (0.6) 896 (0.2) 59 (0.02) CARE with the Helen Keller Foundation (HKF) provided a Vitamin A mega dose (100,000 IU Vitamin A) for a 2 years period . But as the programme was not a complete success, the first comprehensive island -wide nutrition supplementary food intervention known as the Thriposha program was initiated by the Government in 1973 wit h CARE & US AID . This step was taken in response to mounting evidence that certain key segments of the population were highly vulnerable to protein -energy malnutrition (PEM) and micro nutrient deficiency of iron, vitamin A and iodine despite the existence of an island -wide food subsidy scheme. Thriposha means triple nutrient as it provides energy, protein and micronutrients as a pre - cooked 'ready -to-eat' cereal legume based food. Thriposha provided the full vitamin A requirements of a child of 3 years (400 \u00b5g retinol) with 10 gram of reference protein , 320 kilo calories of energy and all the required minerals and vitamins for daily fed on site or take home of 100g per day . In 1995/96 , national survey was carried out to assess the Vitamin A status in Sri Lan ka. This survey revealed 33.3% of children aged 6 months to 72 months were having biochemic al deficiency of Vitamin A (serum retinol <20 \u00b5g/L ) while Bitot's spot, night blindness and Keratomalacia was not a problem of public health significance in the coun try. Figure 1 shows the prevalence of vitamin A deficiency in different provinces in 1995 (MRI 1998) . Vitamin A status report 2006 12 The National strategy to control VAD as a public health problem was de veloped in year 2000 in collaboration with UNICEF . As a result Vitamin A mega dose supplementa tion programme was initiated in year 200 1 for children between 6 months to 5 years and primary schoolchildren providing 5 doses of Vitamin A (100,000IU) at the age of 9 months, 18 months, 5 years and 9 years with the postpartum supplementation of 200,000 IU Vitamin A mega dose for all mothers within 4 weeks of delivery. Globally recommended supplementation schedule was not followed due to the fact that Paediatricians have shown great concern about the toxicity with the high dose of Vitamin A meg a dose (MOH 1999 ). In 2002, p resence of Bitot's spots was examined among 6,264 students aged 10 -18 years and it was found that there was a prevalence of 0.4% with no significant difference between males and females (Jaya tissa et al 2006) . Vitamin A supp lementation coverage was assessed in year 2003 and revealed that 95% of children under five years were given mega dose while the postpartum coverage was only 75% due to poor administration from the hospitals and the lack of awareness among them (Jayatissa & Mahamithawa 2003) . By considering following fact ors this National study was carr ied out under following objectives: OBJECTIVES 1. To measure the serum retinol levels among the children of 6 -60 months. 2. To assess the magnitude of Vitamin A deficiency in S ri Lanka 3. To assess the morbidity pattern and socio economic status among them. 4. To determine the Vitamin A rich food consumption pattern among children. 5. To find out the relationship between Vitamin A deficiency and morbidity, socioeconomic status and consum ption of Vitamin A rich foods. Vitamin A status report 2006 13 CHAPTER 2 METHOD S A cross sectional s tudy was carried out and a three -stage cluster sample design was adopted to draw a nationally representative sample of children 6 - 60 months of age in Government child health facilities . In Sri Lanka of the children under 2 years the proportion attending the Government child health facilities is over 90% and of the children between 2 -5 years the proportion is about 80 % (Family Health Bureau 2007) . Sample size Sample size was calculated considering 36% prevalence of Vitamin A deficiency among children , 95% confidence interval and 5% error. Design effect was taken as 2 due to clustering effect (MRI 1998) . Non respondent rate was taken as 25% due to parental refusal to participate in the st udy or failure to provide a blood sample for analysis. Calculated sample size was 900 children between 6-60 months of age . Sampling Sri Lanka is divided geographically into 25 districts for administrative purposes. Twenty districts out of these 25 distric ts were considered for the study. Jaffna, Killinochchi, Mullative , Mannar and Batticaloe districts were excluded from the study due to the fact that the conflict affected situation in the se districts made accessibility difficul t during the data collecti ng period. It was decided to draw 3 6 clusters and to include 25 children from each cluster to cover the sample size considering logistics . The first stage -sampling frame contained 20 primary sampling units (PSUs) consisting of districts . All selected district s were listed out with the population in each district and numbers of clusters required in each district were selected with probability proportionate to population in size . At the second sampling stage, Medical Officers of Health areas (MOH) from each dist rict were listed out with the population in each MOH area as secondary sampling units and required number of MOH areas per district was selected with probability proportionate to population size. A total of 36 MOH areas were selected . All the selected MOH areas were contacted and a list of Child Welfare Clinics (CWC) together with the average number of clinic attendants per session was obtained from them . The third stage of sampling cons isted of randomly selecting the required number of Child Welfare Clinics (CWC) from each chosen MOH. Altogether 36 CWC s were selected (Annex -1). Twenty five children from each selected CWC were Vitamin A status report 2006 14 randomly selected by using computer generated random numbers . A total of 900 children were included in the study as shown in Figure 2.1. All mothers or care takers of selected children were made conversant with t he procedure and the importance of participation in this study and written consent was obtain ed from them . Figure 2.1 Sampling process DATA COLLEC TION The s urvey team consisted of 4 members from the staff in the Department of Nutrition. Two were nutrition graduates to administer the questionnaire , one was a Public Health Inspector (PHI) to take anthropometric measurements and the other was a Medical Laboratory Technician (MLT) or nurse to collect blood. All had past experience in participating in nutrition s urveys except the nurses . Nurses did the venepunture. PHIs were already trained to detect the Bitot's spot during their basic training. Refresher training was done for PHIs to detect bitot's spot , night blindness, to handle blood and the handling of transport of serum to the Nutrition Laborat ory. Three teams worked and e ach team covered one CWC clinic per day and moved from one district to the other. The d istribution of the sample is shown in Figure 2.2 and each dot represents a cluster. Data collection was s upervis ed by the 20 districts out of 25 Exclud ing Jaffna, Batticaloe, Killinochchi, Mannar and Mullative districts Required number of clusters from each district was selected using PPS technique Required number of MOH areas per district according to the required number of cluste rs in each district was selected using PPS technique CWC from each MOH area randomly selected A total of 3 6 clinics selected 25 children randomly selected from each clinic Total of 900 children aged 6 -60 months Vitamin A status report 2006 15 Nutrition Assistant and the Principle Investigator . Data collection period was from November 2005 to January 2006. Ethical ap proval was obtained from the institution ethical committee and the parental consent too was obtained before enrolment of the child. Questionnaire: An interviewer -administered questionnaire was used to collect information from the mother of the child or fr om a responsible caregiver (Annex -2). They were introduced to a pre -tested standardised questionnaire. The following information was gathered: birth day if not age , sex, morbidity , feeding data, access to water, sanitation , educational status of mothers an d fathers etc. The questions were pre -tested; after the initial training course then questions were modified to increase practicability, reliability and validity. Vitamin A rich food consumption: The Helen Keller International Food Frequency Method was us ed to gather information on how frequently dietary sources of vitamin A were consumed by the children. The Helen Keller Food Frequency questionnaire used in the previous survey carried out in 1995 was adopted and validated. Food items were selected to be included in the questionnaire under four categories. A staple food which is consume d on a daily basis (rice, bread etc), food that is not consumed at all (chillies), Vitamin A rich food (dark green, yellow coloured vegetables, fortified food , liver etc. ), protein and fat rich food (milk, liver, meat, fish, eggs, coconut oil etc.). The mothers or caregivers were asked on \"how many days within the past seven days did the child eat specified food item?\" This question was repeatedly asked for 28 food items (Som mer 1995) . Clinical examination on Bitot's spot and night blindness : All children who had participated in the study were examined for the presence or absence of bitot's spot and ask for night blindness. Impaired dark adaption or nigh t blindness was asses sed by careful, detailed history taken from a parent, or guardian . Specific term describing the characteristics of the behaviour of the affected children was used when taking the history for easy Vitamin A status report 2006 16 identification . The f ollowing local terms were used \"Thamas Andathawaya \" or \" Mandama \". Positives were reassessed by the Nutrition Assistant. Anthropometric measurements: Anthropometric data were collected by three health personnel who had previous experience of participating in nutritional surveys and they were standardised before the study. Height and weight of the children and the mother were measured using standard techniques described by the World Health Organisation (WHO 1995) . Height or length of the child was measured by using height measuring boards and without foot ware. In the case of c hildren under 2 years length was measured and in the case of children over 2 years height was measured. An electronic Seca weighing scale was used to weigh the children with minimum clothing and without foot ware . They were carried by the ir mother s. Accuracy of the weighing scales was checked every morning using the standard weights. Height and weight of mother's were measured by using height measuring rods and electronic seca weighing scales. The weight and height or length was recorded to the nearest 0.1kg and 0.1cm respectively. The measurer variation was assessed by duplicating the 10% of measurements by the same measurer and repeating the 10% by the Nutrition Assistant. The coefficient variation of measurement error was 0 .1 and 0.2 respectively. Biochemical assessment : Venous blood (5cc) samples were collected from both non - pregnant women and her child. If the mother was pregnant and principle care giver was present in the absence of the mother, only a sample from the ch ild was collected. Blood samples were collected for serum Vitamin A analysis by the Nursing officers under sterile condition by using disposable vacutainers not exposing to the sunlight and samples were labelled including cluster number and serial number . Blood samples were protected from light, stored in cool boxes and centrifuged for 10 minutes within 4 -6 hours after collection (at end of the day ) in the closest laboratory under dark environment by the Medical Laboratory Technicians (MLT) in the particula r laboratory. Serum samples were stored in the appendarf and deposited in the big plastic box by batches and stored at -4C till the samples transport to the Medical Research Institute (MRI) for up to 4 days ( at the end of the week ). All plastic boxes with serum samples were transported for a maximum of 6 hours in a cool box before it was stored at the -20C in the Nutrition Laboratory of MRI, where the samples were analysed . The serum s ample a Supelco c18 Vitamin A column under a strict quality Vitamin A status report 2006 17 control protocol and 0.1ml of serum was used for the analysis. HPLC/UV -visible detection - vitamin A method and training manual for assessing Vitamin A status by Dr.Harrold Furr; Lowa State University; U.S.A (1992 ) was used for the analysis . Standards and quality control samples were used to ensure the accuracy of test results. The method was linear for measuring retinol in the range 5 -200\u00b5g/dL. Samples with results <5\u00b5g/dLwere re -analyzed to confirm the result and samples with results >200\u00b5g/dL were diluted 2 -fold and re -tested. The limit of detection for the method was 0.8\u00b5g/dL. All-trans Retinal (retinaldehide) Sigma Chemicals: U.S.A was used as vitamin A standard. Spectrophotomete r was used to determine the standard concentration. MLTs who performed the serum analysis were trained by the Chemical Pathologist and they had previous experience in performing Vitamin A assays. Internal (in -house) Quality Control (QC) program for the vit amin A method was run in every vitamin A assay one level and replicates twice. QC results were monitored using limits developed within laboratory. Levey -Jennings and Shewartz rules for acceptance and rejection QC were used to determine the acceptability of the QC results, and the consequent acceptance or rejection of the assays. The laboratory was participated in an external QC program with C DD Laboratory in Atlanta. DATA ANALYSIS Data was entered in Epi 6 package and the analysis was carried out by usin g SPSS software package. Age was calculated from the subject's birthday taken from the Child Health Development Record (CHDR). Anthropometric data was calculated by using ANTHRO 2005 (WHO) software. The WHO standard (2005) data for height and weight was u sed to estimate prevalence of stunting (height -for-age < -2SD), prevalence of wasting (weight -for- concentration of for VAD and serum retino l concentration <10 \u00b5g/dl as the cut -off point for severe VAD, in accordance with international definitions. The f ollowing cuts off values were used to determine the vitamin A deficiency using food frequency questionnaire in accordance with Helen Keller d efinitions . The m ean number of days of consumption of animal sources of vitamin A less than or equal to four or mean number of days of total consumption of animal sources of vitamin A and one sixth consumption of plant sources of vitam in A ( considering the conversion factor of carotene Vitamin A status report 2006 18 to retinol - 6:1) less tha n or equal to six was taken as adequate consumption of Vitamin A rich food . Cluster sample analysis was carried out by using Epi -Info 6.0 software package. Prevalence of VAD was presented with 95% confidence intervals. Anova, chi square test and odds ratios was calculated using SPSS software package . The level of significance was taken at 0.05. Vitamin A status report 2006 19 CHAPTER 3 DEMOGRAPHIC CHARACTERISTICS A total of 900 children aged 6 -60 months were included in the st udy. Only 768 blood samples ( 85.3%) were analysed for serum retinol level due to inadequate samples or haemolysis of the samples (9.6%) and blood was not collected from 42 (4.7%) children due to refusal of mothers. Altogether non response rate was 14.7%. Majority of c aregivers who were interviewed were mother of the child (95.3%) as shown in Table 3.1.

Of the 898 children in the sample, 2.1% of mother's had not received formal education. Majority had (71.2%) undergone seconda ry school education (grade 6 -11) and 7.1% had attained primary level education. Just over 19% were educated to tertiary level and only 0.8% had completed higher education at university level (Table 3 .2).

Majority of the children (2 7.7% and 26.4%) belong ed to the 12-23 and 36 -47 months of age groups. Only 10% of the children were belonged to 6 -11 months age group because of the narrower age range . The low percentage of children in the 24 to 35 and 48 to 60 months age groups may be due to low coverage of clinic attendanc e of these groups. Among the children selected for the study, 51.7% were boys and 4 9.3% were girls.

Clinical assessmen t All the children included in the sample did not have ni ght blindness or Bitot's spot. Biochemical assessment The cut -off value of <0.70 \u00b5mol/L (20 \u00b5gram/dl) was taken to identify the low Vitamin A status (WHO/UNICEF, 1994). When the serum retinol levels were < 20 \u00b5g/dl those children were identified as Vitami n A deficient and the serum retinol level was <10 \u00b5g/dl those children were identified as severe Vitamin A deficient. Serum retinol concentration in children Serum retinol was measured in all selected children after obtaining permission for a blood sampl e to be taken from caregiver. Figure 3.1 indicates the distribution of serum retinol levels in children. Mean serum retinol level was 23.8 \u00b5g/dl (SD=7.6) Figure 3.1 Distribution of serum retinol level in children Vitamin A status report 2006 23 Figure 3.2 Vitamin A deficie ncy in children year 2005/6 Figure 3.2 shows 29.3% (95% CI: 26.1% -32.5%) children aged 6 -60 months were having the Vitamin A deficiency and 2.3% (95% CI: 1.3% -3.4%) of them were having severe Vitamin A deficiency. According to the global recom mendations , when the prevalence level of 29.3% compares to assess the seriousness of the Vitamin A deficiency as a public health problem which indicates it is still a severe public health problem in Sri Lanka. Prevalence of VAD among children between 1 -5 years was 29.6% (95% CI: 26.2% -32.9%) . Comparison of vitamin A deficiency in children with 1995 survey results The results of this study showed that there is an overall improvement of vitamin A deficiency compared with the 1995 results (Figure 3.3). Figur e 3.3 Comparison of Vitamin A deficiency with 1995 survey data 2.32770.7 01020304050607080 Severe Moderate Normal 9 2.326.3 2765.470.7 01020304050607080 Severe Moderate Normal1995 2006 Vitamin A status report 2006 24 However, the prevalence of severe VAD, defined as a serum retinol concentration < 10 \u00b5g/dl which was 9% in 1995 and it was reduced to 2.3% as shown in this survey. But the moderate defi ciency is still maintained the same level. Figure 3.4 shows that the mean retinol concentration between different age groups which varies from 23.4 - 24.7 \u00b5g/dl and the difference was not statistically significant. Children in all age groups maintained t he serum retinol levels very close to the cut -off value of 20 \u00b5g/dl. Figure 3.4 Distribution of serum retinol level within age groups The highest prevalence of severe Vitamin A deficiency was observed in children aged 6 -11 months and the h ighest prevalence of overall Vitamin A deficiency was with the children aged 24 -35 months (Table 3. 6). Girls were more affected than boys with severe and moderate deficiencies. VAD has increased with increasing age till the age of 35 months. After that the re is a slight drop of the prevalence and then increased again between 48 -60 months. Though the district prevalence was not representative it shows a wide variation from 12% of VAD in Matara district to 40.4% in Vavuniya district.

In Sri Lanka, coverage of measles vaccination was above 95%. Therefore information on morbidity pattern and nutritional status was gathered. Morbidity pattern Each care giver was asked whether their child had suffered from cough or cold with or without fever (defines as respiratory tract infections) or diarrhoea (more than 3 loose stools per day) during the 2 weeks prior to and including the day of the survey. Table 3. 7 indicates that the highest prevalence of respiratory tract infections (RTI) was observed in childre n above 48 months and diarrhoea was in children aged 6 -11 months . Table 3.7 Prevalence of cough or cold with or without fever and diarrhoea in the 2 weeks prior to the survey, reported for children Morbidity Total Age in months Cough / cold with or wi thout fever Diarrhoea 6-11 11 (7.1%) 155 Total 472 (52.6%) 160 (17.8%) 900 Overall, it was reported that 52.6% of children were reported to have had RTI, and that 17.8% had experienced a bout of diarrhoea in the 2 weeks prior to the survey (Table 3.8). Altogether 60% of children suffered from either diarrhoea or RTI.

But the proportions of children with or without VAD were similar among children with or without diarrhoea. However, children with diarrhoea had more severe VAD than the children without diarrhoea. Nutritional stat us Wasting increases with the age as shown in Table 3. 9 and overall wasting was 19.8% and the highest prevalence was observed among children above 48months (27.9%).

Vitamin A status report 2006 29 CHAPTER 6 CHILD FEEDING HISTORY Current breastfeeding practices , age of stopping breastfeeding and age of starting complementary feeding was obtained. Breastfeeding practises About 57% of children are currently being breastfed . It is interesting to note that 93.3% children aged 6 -11 months were breastfed and 11.6% of children above 48 months were also breastfed (Figure 3.5). Figure 3.5 Current breast feeding status in relation to the age 93.3 groups months% Figure 3.6 shows the age at which breastfeeding was stopped . Only 8.6% mothers discontinued the breastfeeding when the child was less than 6 months and 5.5% were never breastfed. One third (31.1%) discontinued the breastfeeding when the age of the child was between 24-35 months.

But the difference was not marked with the children above 24 months. Vitamin A status report 2006 31 Complementary feeding Though WHO has recommended initiating the complementary feeding from the age of six months, Sri Lanka followed up the strategy of initiating complementary fee ding from 5 months onwards up to year 2006. Global recommendation has been adopted by the Mini stry of Health since year 2006 which was after the collection of data for this study. Figure 3.7 Age of starting complementary foods Majority of mot hers, 83.3% ha ve started complementary f eeding between 4 to 6 months of age, whereas 6. 5% gave complementary food before 4 months and 8.1% reported that they had given complementary food between 7 -9 months of age (Figure months% Vitamin A status report 2006 32 CHAPTER 7 VITAMIN A SUPPLEM ENTATION In general, vitamin A supplementations were given during child welfare clinic sessions and recorded on child health development records (CHDR). Each caregiver was asked if their child had been given Vitamin A mega dose supplementation and the las t date of supplementation . The information given by the caregivers was confirmed by checking the CHDR. Sixty five percent of children had received Vitamin A mega dose at least once. Table 3.12 revealed that 76.3% children aged between 12 -23 months had rece ived Vitamin A megadose supplementation. The lowest coverage of supplementation was observed among children above 48 months (60.6%). This may be the fact due to the Vitamin A mega dose supplementation strategy in Sri Lanka.

The lowest retinol concentration was reported from the children who had received Vitamin A mega dose more than 48 months ago (22. 0\u00b5g/L). The preva lence of VAD in children aged 6 to 59 months was 23.9% just after the vitamin A supplementation of children and about 34% within 6 months of the supplementation. After 6 - 11 months or 12 -23 months or more than 24 months after the receive d of last dose of vitamin A supplementation the prevalence of VAD was 32.2%, 28.3% and 31.3% respectively.

Milk was left out when calculating the animal sources of food. Hellen Keller International ( HKI) justifies th is on the assumption that animal milk as served to the children is too diluted and that breast milk is a minor source of vitamin A after the first year. For each questionnaire t he total frequency of consumption of animal sources are added with the total frequency of consumption of vegetables divided by 6, and t he weighted total consumption (animal + vegetables) was taken. Average scores were calculated . This study revealed that mean frequency of consumption of animal s ources of food was 6.1 days , animal an d vegetable sources of vitamin A were 8.5 days. A community is considered to have a vitamin A deficiency problem if it falls below either of two threshold values: 4 days per week for mean frequency of consumption of animal sources of vitamin A, or 6 days p er week for mean frequency of weighted total consumption of animal and vegetable sources of vitamin A. In this study 62.3% of the survey population was above the threshold value in relation to the consumption of animal food sources and 61.3% was above the threshold value to the consumption of both animal and vegetable sources of vitamin A.

A community is defined as having a problem of public health significance when 15% of the child popul ations between 1 and 5 years of age have a serum retinol level of < 20\u00b5g/L as recommended by the International vitamin A Consultative Group (IVCG). T he plasma retinol results from th is study show s that VAD is still a significant public health problem in Sr i Lankan children aged 12 to 59 months and i n non -pregnant women from 15 to 49 years of age, there is a less risk of VAD as a public health problem as the percentage of women who had retinol concentrations < 20\u00b5g/L was 1 4.9% in th is study. There has been no previous stud y in Sri Lanka within this age group for comparison . Although severe VAD has been reduced to 2.3%, part of the apparent failure of the vitamin A supplementation programme may be attributable to the high levels of sub -clinical infection present in the population, and poor eating pattern of vitamin A rich food may be one contributor. Overall coverage of Vitamin A supplementation was poor at 66% . When the interval between the last dose of vitamin A supplementation was wide the mean concentrati on of serum retinol was also low which indicates it is necessary to narrow the gap between doses and to extend the supplementation till 5 years. Currently Sri Lanka is adopting a schedule which provides Vitamin A supplementation at 3 years and then provid es a dose at the age of 5 years. The children between 3 -5 years do not receive Vitamin A megadose in Sri Lanka. 5.1. Morbidity in children It appears that VAD or marginal Vitamin A status is often worsened by infectious disease and reciprocally, that poo r Vitamin A status is likely to prolong or exacerbate the course of illness. The presence of infections such as cough, fever or diarrhoea was associated with a significant decrease in plasma retinol concentration due to inhibiting the synthesis of retinol -binding protein (RBP), the carrier protein for retinol, reducing the circulating vitamin A and so potentially affects the supply of vitamin A to the tissues during infection (Baeton et al, 2004). This study shows high prevalence of RTI (52.6%), diarrhoea ( 17.8%) Vitamin A status report 2006 43 and wasting (19.8%) among children studied. Children with pre -existing mild VAD maybe more prone to severe respiratory infection and diarrhoeal disease than children who are no Vitamin A deficient (Sommer 1995 ). The prevalence of VAD in children with respiratory infections in this study was significantly higher (32.7%) than those with out RTI (25.7% ). But there was no association between the children with diarrhea and poor nutritional status. 5.2 Vitamin A supplementation of children Results of th is study show that 66% of children attended the C WC received a vitamin A supplement. Data from the 2001 coverage survey in Sri Lanka reported the overall coverage of vitamin A supplementation was 67% overall, However, there was variation among the provinces with the rate of supplementation being lowest in the Eastern Province (52%) and highest (83%) in the province . The prevalence of VAD in children aged 6 to 59 months w as 23.9% just after the vitamin A supplementation and about 34% within 6 months of the supplementation. In addition, the mean plasma retinol concentration was higher 6 months within the last dose of vitamin A supplementation compared with other periods . Even after 12-23 months (24.1 g/L) or 24-35 months (24. 6 g/L) of receiving vitamin A supplementation, there was no difference between the plasma retinol concentrations in just after the supplementation (24.6 g/L). Possible explanations are : The interval between high -dose supplement was too wide or the dose of supplement is not adequate maintain high serum retinol levels. 5.3 Child feeding and vitamin A rich food Exclusive breastfeeding for the first 6 months and nutritionally adequate complementary foods with continued breastfeeding up to 2 years of age or beyond is known to help in protecting the children from infection, enabling the children to build up more vitamin A liver stores to help them through the vulnerable weaning period (Miller et al 2002). Based on th is study , 56% of children were currently breastfed . This study revealed that the mean frequency of consumption of animal sources of food was 6.1 days, animal and vegetable sources of vitamin A were 8.5 days. A community is considered to have a vitamin A deficiency problem if it falls below either of two threshold Vitamin A status report 2006 44 values: 4 days per week for mean frequency of consumption of animal sources of vitamin A, or 6 days per week for mean frequency of weighted total consumption of animal and vegetable sources of vitamin A. In this s tudy 62.3% of the survey population is above the threshold value in relation to the consumption of animal food sources and 61.3% were above the threshold value to the consumption of animal and vegetable sources of vitamin A. If at least 70% of the surveyed communities are not above both threshold values, then VAD is likely to be a public health problem in the entire survey area. Therefore in this survey population is considered VAD as a public health problem with regards to the consumption of vitamin A rich food. Vitamin A status report 2006 45 CHAPTER 11 Conclusions and recommendations Following the dissemination of the results from th is vitamin A s tudy, a round table discussion was held in Family Health Bureau, Colombo . The discussion was attended by experts of Ministry of Health, C ollege of Paediatricians and UN organisations . Results from the vitamin A study were discussed and recommendations for the future were proposed: Vitamin A supplementation programme To initiate the vitamin A supplementation from 6 months of age To reduce t he gap between 2 doses and to provide supplementation every 6 months till 5 years, altogether 10 doses of vitamin A megadose To continue the same dose of 100,000IU and repeat the study after one year To s trengthen the implementation of supplementation at CWC at community and district level, there is need to 1. Improve coverage of vitamin A supplementation in all districts, 2. Use advocacy to improve the supplementation programme through public health staff during clinic and home visits . Explore high dose (200, 000 IU) vitamin A supplementation, as a way of ensuring an adequate supply of vitamin A to children in emergency settings by linking to routine immunization. Infection To reduce exposure to infection and improve both vitamin A status, education about reducing exposure to infection should be promoted (e.g. use of bednets, hand washing etc.). Other public health interventions should be encouraged (e.g. clean water, sanitation). Dietary diversification Consumption of vitamin A -rich foods is one of the long -term strategies that can improve vitamin A status, therefore, the promotion, production and consumption of vitamin A -rich foods, such as papaya, pumpkin and mangoes , should be encouraged. Women Improve the postpartum vitamin A capsule supplementation pr ogramme to reduce the deficiency among them. Vitamin A status report 2006 46 REFERENCES 1.
