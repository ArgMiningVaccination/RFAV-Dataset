It questions the discursive connection between the Western colonial project of a 'civilising mission', applied here to the scien tific education of a new Chinese elite and, in t his context, the shaping of a p eculiar Chinese national subject. This article understands this in stitution as a utopian synecdoc he of China, being dressed simultaneously in the clothes of C hinese-ness and those of (Wes tern) modernity. In this training school, where students endeavoured to become intellect uals and scientists fashioned by the methods, values and epistem ologies of the French academi c realm, in this place where students became familiar with ' modern' leisure and sports like football, tennis, cinema, snooker and so on, between those wa lls where students had to le arn how to behave as 'civilised/westernised' moder n men and women, China as a cultur al, ethnic and national identity referent was, paradox ically, constantly mentioned in t he discourse of both the students and the initiators of t his educational institution. Th e experience of this institute appears to be a relevant case study for shedding light on the i ntimate relati onship between the feeling of nationality and t he desire to become modern. Keywords: China, France, colonial humanism , national imaginary, ethnic su bject, geopolitics of knowledge, Orientalism, Chinese-ness, the Study-Work (Lyon Sino-French Institute , hereafter the Institute or IFCL) was a specialised establishment and a constituent part of the University of Lyon. Its purpose was to integrate and men tor Chinese students in the Fre nch university system. It was a project imagined, after the f ailure of the Chinese Study-Work movement in France, by important intellectual figures of the Chinese New Culture Movem ent, including Cai Yuanpei, Li Shizeng and Wu Zhihui. Launched in 1912, the primary goal of the Chinese Study-Work movement had been to give some Ch inese students the opportunity to have a Western/modern education by working in French factories while saving money for their studies. It was interrupted by the economic crisis in France following the Firs t World War. Then, those intellectuals mentioned above, i magined something radically dif ferent. Their idea was to create an educational institution in France entirely dedicated to students previously selected in China. The project was to be undertaken in collaboration wit h both the French and Chinese authorities and was to be financed by the sizeab le indemnity th at France had received from China for the attack on its emb assy in Beijing during the Boxer rebellion.1 The late-Qing popular uprising t argeting Western, and Japanese, colonial powers in China was brutally crushed by the coalition of the Eight Nation Allia nce in 1901. It is relevant to note here that the Boxer Protocol Indemnity imposed on China by Western colonial powers was also partly dedicated t o the education of young Chinese intellectuals in the United States. This 'Boxer Indemnity Scholarship ' was embedded in the same colonial project of civilising the Chinese as the one at the IF CL. Representing China as backw ard, inferior and trapped by its traditions, colonial powers w ould use the tool of education to shape modernised/Westernise d Chinese scientific and intellectual elites consistent with their economic and political interests.2 Founded in 1921, the Institute hosted 473 students during its 2 5 years of existence. The students studied in almost all the academic disciplines: the so cial sciences, literature, law, philosophy, medicine, physical science, pharmacology and so on. At least a quarter of them returned to China with a doctorat e. After their studies in Fran ce, many had outstanding careers as writers, artists, sci entists, university professors and politicians, and thus made a considerable contribution to the development of modern Chinese society and its intellectual and epistemological landscape.3 The Institute left behind an impressive collection of archives 3 Accepted manuscriptand documents, which are now the property of the University of Lyon (Jean Moulin) and are kept in Lyon's municipal library.4 The experience of the IFCL has often been described as an authentic Sino-French cultural exchange by the actors within and the later commentators on the project.5 While this history is certainly transcultural, bringing about exchanges of ideas, texts, languages, methodologies and customs, we would miss a cruc ial point by interpreting it within a utopian discourse of fruitful cultural dialogue betwee n two autonomous and homogeneo us cultures. This is so not only because this abstract idea of intercultural exchange is to o often sustained by a de- socialised and de-historicise d idea of culture but also because , when we carefully listen to the discourse of the actors on the French side, there is no hint of a cultural exchange between two groups, but rather a conscious project of cognitive and intelle ctual colonialism, or what was called in France the mission civilisatrice (civilising mission). Rec ognising that the Chinese initiators of this intellectual experience deeply interiorised a Eurocentrist and historicist narrating of progress and civili sation inherited from the Europ ean Enlightenment, philosophy confirmed the epistemological h egemony of the West over the Chi nese intellectual world at that time.6 The present article suggests an i nterpretation of the transcultural experience of this Chinese school in France as a set of prac tices, discourses and institut ions - what Foucault termed a dispositif or apparatus - contributing to the fabrication of subjectiviti es, in this case the construction of 'Chinese modern subjects'.7 While this notion of appa ratus helps to point out the structural power relations that contributed to moulding the cultural identity of these students, it is also pivotal to take into account the capacity of empowerment of the subjects themselves in this specific contex t. This article tries to shed light on how the students of the Institute have been identified, a nd have identified themselves, simultaneously as 'Chinese' and 'modern'. The main goal of this school was to train a future Chinese scie ntific elite that would dedicate itself to the modernisation of C hina. However, reading the test imonies and archives about this experience allows us to highlig ht another function of this inst itution of knowledge - to contribute to the emergence, or reinforcement, of a sentiment o f nationality among the students. There is nothing new in mentioning that cultural nati onalism praising particularism 4 Accepted manuscriptis often stronger within diaspora and exiled communities than i n the native country. In Lyon, the distance from the homeland, t he remoteness of the students from, and alterity of, the French cultural environment probably helped to intensify the construction of a national consciousness. Moreover, not only local French newspapers but a lso academics and politicians connected with the Institute constantly asserted th e putative Chinese-ness of the students. Finally, entrusted with the task of leading the modernisation of China, the students were also convinced and conscious Chinese patriots. A Western School of Modernity Looking at the discourse of the intellectuals and professors, b oth French and Chinese, who played a leading role in this ed ucational proposal, it is obvio us that this institution had been imagined as a school of modernit y for Chinese youth. Modernity is here the name for the epistemologically, c ulturally and ideologi cally dominant norms and values in the broader context of French/Western soc iety during the 1920s. First professor of Chinese at Lyon University, and one of the foundi ng fathers of the Institute, Maurice Courant, was explicit when describing the main goal of the IFCL: The Lyon Sino-French institute of St Ir\u00e9n\u00e9e Castle is dedicated to training an elite of technicians an d academics capable of leadi ng the development of China - in the indus trial, commercial and artist ic fields as well as in the sci entific and pedagogic ones - in the direction required by the present situation. The aim was to educate Chinese youth in all the fields of moder n life to guide the future development of China 'in the direction required by present situ ation'. This last phrase could be translated as follows: 'i n the direction wished by the West' . Courant adds that the students were coming to Lyon to 'supplement their traditional culture an d search in the West for the technical dimension of modern life'. 8 Since, in the collective im aginary of this period, the 'modern' was congruent with the 'Western', the European or the French, the real concrete goal of the Institute was to accu lturate the students: learning French academic and scientific culture, seizing 'moral ideas' and 'republican values', adoptin g of the so-called modern/French civ ilisation (leisure, sports, hygienic habits and the like). The 5 Accepted manuscriptquotation below from a n article entitled ' Lyon, Carrefour des races: Les Chinois de Saint- Ir\u00e9n\u00e9e' (Lyon, Crossroad of The Chinese of Saint Irene) in L'Est R\u00e9publicain of 1 October 1930 unveiled the modernity of students' material life, which is confirmed by the archives of the Institute, esp ecially in photos of the students and their living conditions: At St Ir\u00e9n\u00e9e castle, the students' comfortable lives are like h ose at Oxford or Harvard College. El ectricity, running water, bathrooms, tennis, basketball and European c uisine, contribute to create t he necessary pleasure that shoul d go along with studying. Nice roo ms with two beds, decorated with the careful attention which chara cterises Oriental people, are occupied by tw o students from the same cla ssroom and having common affinities.9 Regarding the sociocultural ba ckground of the students, it is obvious that they were confronted with new practices, a new material everyday life, and new imaginaries during their sojourn in France. Howev er, one of our tasks here is to highlight the ideological function of the 'modern' substantive when it comes to being a p roperty of the West and a legitimating discourse of Europe an imperialism. Citing Oxford a nd Harvard as models of advanced colleges, this discours e broadens the scope of moderni ty, subsuming the colonial Western world as a whole. The dis cursive practices of the Insti tute and its residents are deeply embedded in this Orienta list binary epistemology that lo cates academic, material, moral and political mode rnity in France while Others (Chinese, Oriental) are seen as situated in a backward, pre-moder n and particular position.10 In this paradigm, manifest or lat ent discourse stressing cultur al difference and essential identity is always associated with the historicist discourse of modernity: 'Nic e rooms with two beds, decorated with the caref ul attention which characteri ses Oriental people, are occupied by two students from t he same classroom and having com mon affinities'. The mention of the 'Oriental' is di screet while meaningful, thoroug hness ( la minutie ) being a specific characteristic of the C hinese/Oriental subject. In the following pages, I will try to demonstrate that, in t his manufacture of modern subjectivities, the students were constantly hailed as 'Chinese' subjects be ing sent back to an ethnicity so lidified by racialism, nationalism and culturalism. 6 Accepted manuscriptWhile the modern/Western appara tus will have as identity hasn't disappe ared. The discourse of 'becom ing modern and staying Chinese' is perfectly illustrated by the p aragraph below, from the same 1 October 1930 L'Est R\u00e9publicain article, about a student pain ting exhibition in that year: 'Th e artists praised newness and their works are modern with a \"something\" [ je ne sais quoi ] that suggests, in spite of all, an atavist ic respect for past traditions'. The 's omething' ( je ne sais quoi ) represents what Rey Chow has call ed the 'ethnic supplement' sti cking to the skin of those apparently unable to escape their putative Chinese-ness.11 As Nora Wang puts it in her work on Chinese student emigration in France, the French government did not have any speci fic 'Chinese policy' during th e 1920s. However, some French politicians, intellectua ls, industrialists and business people were interested in China for both commercial and ideological reasons. One of the main ob jectives on the French side in this educational partnership with China was to train Chinese executives who would be familiar with French industry and technology and become potenti al buyers of French products.12 The goal of the Institute was not purely philanthropic and sel fless; it was articulated with the interests of French econo mic and political expansion. Courant insisted on the fact that those 'friendshi ps' created by the Institute woul d help 'us' to 'spread French ideas and French goods': 'Today, som eone is asking for lightning: let's make sure that the new firebox lit on the banks of the Pacific will soon bring us back light and warmth'.13 This discourse, which articulates the republican universalism o f the civilising mission and a concern with the prosperity and s trength of the nation is typic al of the 'French imperial nation-state' doctrine that has affirmed a coherent and systema tic imperialist policy since the Third Republic.14 For instance, the views of J ules Harmand, a diplomat and empir e administrator in Indochina, are a perfect theorisation of this colonial policy based on 'association', 'mutual help' and 'development'. As Harmand put it, the 'conqueror' had to defend its economic and political i nterests but without forgetting its moral responsibility over the 'conquered'.15 In this perspective, the col onised were not only a pure object but also a subject capable of transforming themselves to become modern hum an beings through education by the coloniser. Whi le China in the 1920s was not a French colony, unlike Indochina, this discourse of 'colo nial humanism' is nevertheles s ubiquitous in the archives of 7 Accepted manuscriptthe IFCL.16 As mentioned in the journal of the Institute in 1928, the scho ol was 'the peaceful citadel where we invent the new men of China'.17 In the perspective of Maurice C ourant and other French initiato rs of the Institute, the journey of the Chinese stude nts from China to Fr ance was not only a geographical or cultural displacement; it also had a tem poral dimension: from past to pr esent, from the 'traditional to the 'modern world'. Thi s Eurocentrist colonial rse was intimately linked to a well-known nineteenth-century Hegelian representation of histor y as linear, progressive and universal. As Walter Migno lo stipulates in his Local Histories/Global Designs , if 'Space was dominant in the imaginary of the previous stage of colonial expansion (sixteenth and seventeenth centuries), from th e nineteenth century, Time reord ered universal history and became the \"essence\" of modern ity'. The anthropologist adds tha t the linear time of universal history became, furthermore, entr enched within the very idea of the civilising mission: 'to be civilized was to be modern, and to b e modern meant to be in the present'.18 While there were divergent pers pectives and finan cial tensions between the French and Chinese sides involved in the I nstitute, the leading Chinese fi gures of the Study-Work movement in France did not contest this Eurocentri c historicism . The French colonial humanism promoting republicanis m, scientism and universal values was perfectly consistent with the May Fourth cultural and i ntellectual imaginaries, at l east with the progressivist and Occidentalist intellectuals i nvolved in the Study-Work program.19 Let us recall here the equivalence made between mode rnity, Europe and France by the le ading figure of the May Fourth Movement, Chen Duxiu, in his famous 1915 article, 'Franc e and Modern Civilization': 'Modern civilization is exclusively European or Western civilization. It is European civilization that has been transplanted to America and is all the rage in Asia. All European people have made cont ributions to the European civiliz ation, but its leaders have been the French'.20 In the same vein, the foreword of the 'Rules of the Association of Frugal Studies in France', established by Li Shizeng and Cai Yuanpei in Beijing in 1912, assumed clearly this Europeandiscourse of modernity: 'Studying in the West is a necessity to reform society, respect education and introduce worl d civilisation to the country'. 21 In this global imaginary, the 'West' isn't a civilisation or a culture among others; this pla ce is situated at the centre of the 8 Accepted manuscriptgame, establishing the norms and the hegemonic values of modern ity: 'It is an ambiguous and ubiquitous presence of a certa in global domin ation whose su bject can hardly be identifiable. What is at issue he re is \"the West\" insofar as pe oples in the so-called non-West have to refer to and rely on it so a s to construct their own cu ltural and historical identity'.22 As Naoki Sakai puts it, 'the West ' is a category t hat designate s a dominant, hegemonic geopolitical but also epistemological position in a globalised modernity. In this perspective, the Others, non-Westerners, can't but refer to this centre to d efine themselves from the position of a negative rhetoric. W hile this theoretical articul ation of 'the West and the rest' remains questionable and should be adjusted for diverse socio-h istorical contexts, it is enlightening when interpreting the experience of IFCL students. The simultane ity of the inscription of China in a (gl obal) modernity - defined by Rebec ca Karl as 'a global material and representational structure, whose tendential unities are un derpinned by the expansion of capitalism in its imperialist f orms' - and the emergence of a discourse of national identity find an interesting illustration w ithin the micro-society of th e IFCL.23 If the Institute was conceived as a school of modern ity, I also hypothesise that it functioned as a device that contributed to shaping a 'Chines e subject', hardening the feeli ng of Chinese-ness among the students, and homogenising practic es and discourses considered Chinese. Patriots, Native Guides and Ethnic Subjects This discursive link be tween the meta-narrative of Eurocentrist modernity and the inscription of the students in a dedicated e thnic identity is also confirme d by a close reading of the scientific production of the Inst itute's residents. A previous work on the paratexts of the students' PhD dissertations helps to foreground an interesting articulation between national subjectivity, Orientalis t discourse and the c olonial distributi on of knowledge.24 Reading these texts from the theoretical and hi storical perspective of the co lonial geopolitics of knowledge, I have tried to shed light on the a mbivalences of the geo-histo rical position of these young Chinese scholars who were immer sed in the 'Western' culture of scholarship while basing their research on China. The structural asymmet ry in the distribution of modern scientific knowledge between the dominant (colonial) cultures of scholarship in Europe - locus o f academic production - and 'the rest of the world' - that is to say, colonised, semi-colonised or marginalised countries 9 Accepted manuscriptreduced to an object of study - has been well documented and st udied: 'The map of scholarly production between 1850 and 1945 traced by Wallerstein had scho larship located in Europe and the rest of the World was e ither the scene o f interesting h uman achievements to study and understand, but frozen in time and antimodern, or of cultur es where the civilizing mission had precisely the mission to civilize'.25 In the context of Sino logical studies, the French philosopher Anne Cheng has underscored what she calls a paradox: after having been deeply appreciated in France during the Enlightenment century, 'Chinese thought' was excluded from the field of philosophy wit h the increasing Sinophobia of the nineteenth century. The paradox was that while China was disappearing as a 'knowing subject'- as a producer of ideas and knowledge - C hina as an object of study, that is to say Sinology, or the Science of China, emerged as a n official discipline in the Fren ch academic world.26 The focus here is on the epist emological positions of the Insti tute's students seeing themselves as in the positi on of universal and objective 'knowi ng subjects' and, at the same time, defining themselves, and bei ng reduced to, Chinese ethnic subjects, intimately linked with China, their object of st udy. Absent, veiled or marginalis ed in some theses, Chinese-ness was claimed or valorised in some other works as an ethnic, cultural or political identity. Being patriots, 'native guides' or 'authentic' representatives of a traditional culture, the students often remained in the local, particular position of th e Oriental facing the universal West. Among the 136 listed theses, 41 explicitly deal with a su bject related to China. Even if, at first glance, it might seem obvi ous that 'Chinese' students should work on Chinese topics, I wish to question this common sense position, especially the ov erdetermined Chinese-ness of the students. Even if the large percentage of China-centered to pics is the result of the Institute's policies and PhD dir ectors, this unquestioned certa inty of ontological Chinese ethnicity is also inscribed in t he words of the students themse lves. Reading closely the thesis of Tcheng Tse-sio entitled ' Les relations de Lyon avec la Chine: Etude d'histoire et de g\u00e9ographie \u00e9conomiques' (Relations between China and Lyon: a study of history and e conomic geography), i t becomes clear th at the author is in fact partly narrating his own story in this dissertation. He mentions 'thos e students selected by Chinese universities' to attend the IFCL and later 'holding important i ntellectual and economic positions when re turning in China'.27 However, maintaining an objective and neutral position, Tcheng never explicitly includes himself as a subject of his work. 10 Accepted manuscriptIn the same vein, Woo Tsou-sing, on e of the few women PhD stude nts of the Institute, wrote her thesis on the well-known Han Dynasty woman historian Ban Zh ao, composer of the famous 'lessons for women'. Dealing with modern Chinese women's conditions in the last part of her dissertation, she e xplicitly mentions her own situation: 'Many young girls and women are going to Europe and the States to study; they struggl e with all their strength to be as progressive as men, to be free and to have the same rights a s men...' Woo finishes her thesis with the inclusive 'we' of the Chinese woman: 'We must n ot give up our fight for a more active, freeer, and m ore comprehensive life'. 28 Integrated within the French academy, Tcheng and Woo put themselves in the position of the objective, neutral 'know ing subject'. But, at the same time, Tc heng as a Chinese student studying abroad, and Wu as a Chines e woman student fighting for women's emancipation, merge with their own object of study, echoing Rey Chow's statem ent that 'minorities are allowed the right to speak only on t he implicit expectation that they will speak in the documentary mode, \"reflecting\" the group from which they come'.29 In most of the dissertations involving China, while being within a culture of scholarship claiming a universal, objective and transcendental knowing subject, the students can't but speak from theinside of an ethnic/national Chin ese community. They are often put in the positi on of 'native guides of the country' - as coin ed by the student Yu Tchen-p'ong in the introduction to his thesis 'The Mortgage in Chinese Common Law' - as having the fun ction of driving information and data from the lo cal field to the European acade mic field. 30 Similarly, Yuan Chaucer, working on the intellect ual history of the Warring Sta tes period, writes from the enunciative position of the 'contemporary Chinese': 'Let's ment ion briefly our own attitude, as contemporary Chinese, before th e philosophy of Confucius and Mencius'.31 The linguistic subject is never the 'we'of the putative neutral and objective scientific subj ect. The merging with their object of s tudy goes even further in the liminal ass ertion of Hsu Sung-Nien's dissertation on the great Tang dynasty poet Li Bai: In France, sinologists, essay ists, novelists and journalists ha ve studied Li Bai's poetry and talked a bout him, but, for various reasons, his real personality remains unknown. Some writers would have avoided making mistakes about him if they had had a better knowledge of the Chinese literary writing and of Chi nese private life. [...] How c an 11 Accepted manuscriptthey, for example, feel a poem written in our language without having experienced for some years i n our own privacy [...] Those who hav e an imperfect knowledge of Chin ese writing, those who having probably lived apart from the Ch inese, will inevitably spoil th e poet's work.32 Here the author is claiming his proximity and intimacy with his object of study, the poet Li Bai. He underscores a native knowle dge, internal , intuitive, no n-open to 'sinologists, essayists, novelist s and journalists' and 'people who stand apart from the Chinese'. The distinction made between 'us and them' would not have been possible without postulating the permanence of a n 'us': Hsu Sung-nien presuppose s a continuity between the student and the author of the st udied texts, based here on a tr anshistorical and essentialised cultural identity revealed in the expression 'Chinese private l ife'. This knowledge of the native is also emphasised by Hoang Tsen-yue in his thesis, a co mparative study of Laozi, Kongzi and Mozi.33 In the preface to this dissertation, the French philosopher Ed mond Goblot - attached to the IFCL and PhD d irector of some students - deve lops a classical Orientalist opposition between France and Europe as the location of modern science and the Others - here China - as fixed traditional cultures lacking scientific k nowledge. In a paternalist stance, Goblot found very moving the attach ment of the student to his n ational philosophy and his wish to introduce it in Europe. Th e French professor developed an argument about the added value for the academic institu tion in France of having a 'Chine se' studying and introducing Chinese philosophy in Europe: You told me that my hypothesis c onforms to Lao Tseu's thinkin g; it's difficult for me to believe it. It's almost impossible for a European from the twentieth centur y, who would use guesses, to catch up an extreme-oriental philosopher from fifth or sixth century B.C. B ut you, Chinese, should be able to conf irm, condemn or rectify this hypothesis by the study of the t exts and, if necessary, through philological study.34 Goblot adds that, in this disse rtation, he was looking for some thing attainable only through the mentality and characters of t he Chinese 'race' ('Chinese bo dy and soul'), something he 12 Accepted manuscriptwould not be able to find in the work of a Sinologist: 'You, as Chinese body and soul, can bring something unique to our knowle dge of China'. With Goblot' s words 'you, Chinese', we are confronted with a textbook case of the Althusserian view of ideology as interpellation: through the hailing of ideology, indi viduals are constantly cre ated as subjects. However, if the subject recognises himself as a Chinese subject when being hailed, that is because in a specific social-historical situ ation he has already been identified, and identifies himself, as a Chinese subject a nd not someone else.35 What Goblot and others w ere saying is that through the very specific ethnic Chinese reading of the texts, 'we', Eu ropeans, have a chance to discover the mystery of the Chine se soul. Here, the added value of the students is precisely their supposed authentic ethni city and nativist position. While having noted the necessity for the students to learn Western scientific methods, Professor Cou rant insisted on their contribution to the knowledge of C hina with what he called thei r 'native qualities'. As he put it: 'Discovering Chinese civilisa tion with the work of the Chin ese, this is the most natural way, isn't it ?'36 This localised, contingent, embedded position of the students i s also very well expressed in affirmations of national consci ousness. Behind the 'native guid e' there is often a fervent patriot. Since national salvati on was a crucial argument in the choice of dissertation topic, many theses take an instrumenta l or applied approach, dealing a s they did with key practical contemporary Chinese topics. As Tchang Lam puts it in his work on public instruction in China, he must conduct research t o find 'appropriate cures' for all the 'administrative failures' of China's education system.37 In the same vein, James Woo, among many others, mentions that 'for a Chinese' his research has an obvious 'prac tical dimension'.38 Li Tsi Gziou writes explicitly in his applied research on the 'Passive Defence of Civil Populations against the Aero-Chemical War in China' following Japan's aeria l bombardment of Shanghai in 1933: We must foresee a great war be tween the two great yellow people ... The old Occident being the cradl e of modern culture, which has been so successful to our immoral and unscrupulous neighbours, we elaborated this modest work on defence measures against the aer o- chemical risk inspired by the gre at European mas ters on the eve of the awakening of China. 39 13 Accepted manuscriptThese patriotic interventions articulate the idea, which dates back to the Self-Strengthening Movement of the mid-nineteenth century, of using European scien ce and knowledge as a way of resolving China's socio-politi cal difficultie s. In many case s, the ambiguity between the requirements of academic knowledge - being a neutral knowing su bject - and students' subjective, embedded political pos ition as 'Chinese' is directly stated in some texts. Henri T.T. Tchai, who undertook research on the sensitive question of the unequal treaty system, while emphasising the necessity o f objectivity a nd impartiality recognises the difficulty of the task for him as a Chinese patriot: We want to let people know how difficult it has been during thi s research to silence the inner vo ice of patriotism which keeps protesting indignantl y against these unjust treaties imposed on our miserable country.40 Addressing his readers, Tchai r eveals how deeply the feeling of nationality has been interiorised by the students a nd how difficult it has been to c onstrain the so-called 'inner voice of patriotism.' Becoming 'Chinese' in Lyon : Discourse and Practices Nationalist ideology in China, e mbodying the will to invent a p olitical nation-state, goes back to the eve of the twentieth cen tury as a consequence of, and an answer to, Western imperialism. The spread of ethno-ra cial theories helped intellectuals and politicians to imagine an organic and natural Chinese identity and to populari se a sentiment of nationality among educated urban Chinese c itizens. In 1919, contesting the decisions of the Treaty of Versailles, a modern patriotism suddenly erupted in metropolita n China in the demonstrations of the May Fourth movement. Nev ertheless, at that time, nationa lism and the spreading ethnic/racial categories of identity did not signify that China had already been constituted as, or represented a homogenous cultural and linguistic national space. In the period of the foundation of the Institute, the h istorical reality was of a mu ltiplicity of languages and cultural practices among the Chi nese population. Before joining the Institute, the students followed a common training pathwa y in specific preparatory scho ols located in large cities 14 Accepted manuscriptlike Beijing, Shanghai and Chengdu, but the geogra phical origin s, the social backgrounds, the languages and the cultural practi ces of the students were extre mely diverse. In his 'scattered memories of Lyon', the former s tudent Cui Zaiyang insisted on t his cultural heterogeneity within the student community: 'W e were coming from different pr ovinces, speaking different languages and having different customs'.41 Our last point focuses on the eve ryday practices of the student s, and more precisely the way in which those practices were part of a discourse of national c ulture. In Benedict Anderson's famous thesis on the national, c ommunity was 'imagined' also be cause 'even the smallest nation will never know their fello w-members, meet them or even hear of them...'42 But to the contrary here, limited to withi n the walls of the St Ir\u00e9n\u00e9e cas tle, the IFCL had a 'real' and concrete community of human dime nsion. In this compressed time/space one could witness, at a molecular scale, practice s, institutional rituals and disc ourses that helped to reinforce the awareness of belonging to a uniqu e community. Reading the IFCL archives enables us to confirm the deployment of an imaginary of national culture. The learning of Mandarin, the promotion of 'Chinese' art and culture through exhibitions, the development of a Sinological library - including an important c ollection of literary works from the imperial epoch - and the annual celebration of the na tional day contributed to culti vating, or initiating, a shared cultural identity am ong the students. While the students held d ifferent political positions, the IFCL leaders emphasised ideolog ical neutrality and subsumed tho se different tendencies under the meta-political nationali st discourse of modernisation , or saving the motherland with science. Finally, while cultura l and linguistic practices appea r to have been diverse, due to the geographical origins of the st udents, testimonies reveal a homo genisation of practices and discourses among them. In this regard, Zheng Yanfen's narration of his first days at the Institute in 1926 is part icularly relevant: It could seem funny, but I learne d the national language in France with my comrade of the In stitute. I remember that before leaving for France, while I was in Shanghai for my passport, I always shopp ed in a store on Sichuan Street because the shopkeeper spoke Cantones e. Since I didn't speak the national language, it was the only way for me to communicate without constr aints. . . .After arriving in Lyon, students of the Institute, esp ecially those from Sun-yat-sen University, set up a welcoming c eremony for us. I had to say a few 15 Accepted manuscriptwords. While I was intimidated, I forced myself to say some wor ds in the national language, but, after a few sentences I had no othe r solution than speaking in Cantonese and letting a comrade do th e translation. This event make m e realise some thing of utmost importance: as long as I didn't speak the national language, I wouldn't be able to assume my duties. From that time on, I've b een determined to learn it.43 This text reminds us that the difference between the vernacular local idiom and the national language was, and still is in ma ny parts of China and Taiwan, a historical reality. In the 1920s in China, Zheng Yanfen, who needed a translator to communicate with his compatriots, experienced linguistic disconti nuity, and cultural difference, within the so-called national community. This linguistic heterogeneity and the role played by IFCL in the process of homogenisation is also at stake i n the memories of Danielle Li, daughter of Li Shuhua, a student in the Institute be tween 1923 and 1926: 'Arriving in Ly on, my father only spoke Hakka; he learned official Chine se with his Hunanese comrade in the Institute'. Thanks to his first Chinese teacher, L i Shuhua spoke Mandarin with a Huna nese accent, reminding us of the partial and relative dimens ion of this cultural and linguis tic homogenisation.44 While contesting the mythical dis course of an organic Chinese c ultural community by pointing out differences between s tudents, the testimonies simu ltaneously state an apparent erasure of those differences in t he IFCL context. The place wor ked as a laboratory where everyday life practices tended to be standardised and unified. However, if Li Shuhua, Zheng Yanfen and many others were, in a sense, becoming Chinese in Ly on, it was not only because their new customs would be objectively the s ame as those of the other students (they were using a common idiom); it was also because they had made theirs a discourse of national culture, which allowed them to identify those practices as bein g part of a specific national culture. Preceding the narration o f his difficulties in communi cation with his comrades, the very first lines of Zheng Yanfe n's testimony attest to this representation of a nationalised everyday life: 'At the Institute, there are only Chinese studen ts, we're all living together, everybody speaks a Chinese langua ge, eats Chinese food, and liv es the Chinese way of life'.45 Feminist writer Su X uelin is even more explicit in her autobiog raphy: 'When we arrived in France, this civilised and progre ssive country, we were immerse d into a Chinese sea. 16 Accepted manuscriptSpeaking Chinese, hearing Chinese, eating Chinese; our rooms lo oked Chinese; all everyday life customs were becoming Chine se, as if we were still living in China'.46 Zheng and Su subsume a set of pra ctices, people, things, langua ges and the like within a unique national category: 'Chines e'. However, the issue here is not the real or putative origin of those phenomena. A historical inquiry to r eveal the authenti c Chinese-ness of those practices would be meaningless. T he link made between ethnicity or nationality and a specific cultural practice is, for the most part, contingent an d arbitrary. We always witness different cultural practices within an ethnic/national populati on and, at the same time, common cultural practi ces that overcome et hnic/national boundar ies. As shown by the archives, the students had nume rous other common everyday life practices that were not included within the imaginary of Chinese-ness: for instance, pl aying tennis or pool, going to the movies or wearing suits and so on. Unlike eating fried nood les and speaking Mandarin, those customs hadn't been ca ught up in the discourse of nationa l culture. When Su Xuelin uses the expression zhongshihua, or 'Sinicisation,' she is not only describing a homogenisation of social practices in the everyday life of the Institute; she is also revealing that a set of common chosen practices are being caught up wit hin a discourse that emphasises national culture. The ve ry special context of the Institute ena bles us to highlight discourses and practices of nati onal recognition and identification. To conclude, we must understand this experience in a broader hi storical context. From the end of the nineteenth century on, C hinese nationalist discourse appeared simultaneously with a new global consciousness.47 Chinese nationalism must not be only read as an oppositional and anti-colonial ideology targe ting Western imperialism. Natio nal consciousness constitutes in itself a fundamental propert y of the modern subject shaped i n the context of global modernity, led by Western powers. As I tried to show at the mic ro-level of this educational experience, the nation-state bui lding project led by May Fourth intellectuals was totally harmonious with the French colonial discourse of modernisation - the 'civilising mission' - addressed to Chinese students at the IFCL.48 In the 1920s context, Chinese nat ionalism was unable to escape the epistemological and historiographical framework imp osed by Western colonial hegemon y. However, th argument can be deepened, with Gregory Lee , who demonstrates without amb iguity that 'China' as a concept and an imagined cultural/n ational community was initial ly created by and in the 17 Accepted manuscriptWest.49 From the Late Qing period on, 'Chinese' intellectuals, writers and politicians interiorised this imagined 'Chin a' in order to invent a modern nation-state. The IFCL epitomises the subjective eff ect of this co-production among th ose young becoming-Chinese scholars. Theorising the comp licity between of particularity, Sakai Naoki has po inted out that the cultural and national identities of the peripheries construct ed themselves withi n their confrontation w ith the West as the normative figure of modernity: 'It is pr ecisely the demand to \"become like a Westerner!\" or to \"acquire the standards of the West\", that makes one aware of those histo rical and cultural traces that have accumulated within the body t hat make it impossible, try a s one might, to comply with the demand'.50 This coincidence between the ins cription of China in global mod ernity and the spread of a national imaginary is perfectly i llustrated in the experience o f the IFCL, a utopian synecdoche of China being dresse d simultaneously in the clothes of Chinese-ness and in those of modernity. In this institution, where students endeavo ured to become intellectuals and scientists fashioned by the methods, values and epistemolog ies of the French academic realm, in this place where stude nts become familiar with 'modern' leisure and sports like football, tennis, cinema and s nooker, between those walls where students had to learn how to behave as 'civilised/Westernis ed' modern men and women, China a s a cultural, ethnic and national identity referent was paradoxically constantly mention ed in the discourse of both the students and the initiators of t his educational institution. The experience of the IFCL appears to be a relevant case study for shedding light on the intimate relationship between the feeling of nationality and the desire to become modern. 18 Accepted manuscript1 Hongling Liang, of Modern China: From the 'Sc holarly Fund of the Boxer to the Franco-Chinese Institue of Lyon], Transtext (e)s-Transcultures: of Global Cultural , 9, 2014, https://transtexts.revues.org/515 , accessed 4 July 2017. 2 See also on this topic James L.
