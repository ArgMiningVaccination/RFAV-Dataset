CEREMONY INFO: We are living in a world driven by masculine energy. The masculine energy is focused on doing and achieving. Since the masculine energy is so overruling. We start to feel unhappy and disconnected from ourselves. More and more woman feel the need to re-connect with their Divine Feminine Energy. Connecting to the divine feminine within is all about slowing down and being rather than doing. The energy of the feminine embodies nurturing, soft, grounded with strong boundaries, and trusting of her intuition. I created this special workshop for us combined with a cacao ceremony. We will drink together the ceremonial cacao and set our intentions for the start of this year. Cacao is know as a heart opening medicine that helps to expand insight and awareness. Cacao is packed full of vitamins and minerals and increases blood flow to the brain which helps to strengthen awareness and focus. It helps the body to heal, detoxify and to give your immune system a good boost. We will start this day to set our intentions together we will drink the ceremonial cacao. I will guide you through a meditation to connect you with your divine feminine energy. After this we will start moving with a slow sensual yoga/pilates flow. At the end of the ceremony there will also be sharing in the circle. Please note: cacao is not a drug or psychedelic. Cacao is a safe plant and won't make you high or hallucinate.
