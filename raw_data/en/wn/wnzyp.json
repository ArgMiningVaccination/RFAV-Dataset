Incidence by health authority has stabilized or increased slightly since weeks 25 and 26: Since week 26, Fraser Health incidence was stable (at 6 per 100K). Since week 25, Vancouver Coastal incidence was stable (at 6 per 100K). Since week 25, Interior Health incidence increased ( 10 to 15 per 100K). Since week 25 , Island Health incidence was stable (at 1 per 100K). Since week 26, Northern Health inciden ce was stable (at 1 per 100K). Most a ge-specific incidences have been stable , except for increases in the 20 -29 year -olds from 11 to 15 per 100K between weeks 25 - 28; and in the 30 -39 and 40 -49 from 7 to 10 per 100K and 5 to 8 per 100K, respectively , between week s 26-28. By week 28, the single -dose vaccination coverage in 12+ year -olds reached 80 %; 52% were fully vaccinated Testing of MSP -funded specimens has stabilised at ~17,000 specimens since wee k 26. Positivity of MSP -funded specimens has also stabilized at 2.0% since week 26 . Hospital and intensive care unit admissions have both been declining since week 15, with 16 and 2 admissions reported in week 28 , respectively . The number of deaths decrea sed since week 19 with 2 deaths reported in week 28. By case of earliest onset date, there were two new outbreaks repor ted in care setti ngs in week 28. BCCDC COVID -19 Situational Report Week 28 Page 2 of 10 BELOW ARE IMPORTANT NOTES relevant to the interpretation of data displayed in this bulletin: Episode date s are defined by dates of illness onset. When those dates are unavailable, earliest laboratory date is used (collection or result date); if also una vailable, then public health care report date is used . Analyses based on episode date (or illness onset date) may better represent the timing of epidemic evolution. Episode -based tallies for recent weeks are expected to increase as case data, in particular onset dates, are more complete . The weekly tally by surveillance date (result date, if unavailable then report date) includes cases with illness onset date in preceding weeks. Episode dates for hospital admission, ICU, and death are defined by admission a nd death dates. When unavailable, surveillance date is used. As of June 15, 2021, per capita rates/incidences for year 2020 are based on Population Estimates 2020 (n= 5,139,568 for BC overall) and for year 2021 are based on PEOPLE 2020 estimates (n= 5,197 ,224 for BC overall). Laboratory data include Medical Service Plan (MSP) funded (e.g. clinical diagnostic tests) and non -MSP funded (e.g. screening tests) specimens. Data sources include: health authority case line list data, laboratory PLOVER data , PHSA P rovincial Immunization Registry (PIR), and hospital data (PHSA Provincial COVID19 Monitoring Solution (PCMS)). Case data were extracted on July 26, 2021 , laboratory data on July 23, 2021 , PIR vaccine coverage date on July 23, 2021, and PCMS hospitalizatio n data on July 26, 2021 . A. COVID -19 case counts and epidemic curve s As shown in Figure 1 , provincial incidence has stabilized since week 25 at ~6 per 100K per week . Up to week 28 , 2021, there have been 148,601 cases for a cumulati ve incidence of 2,855 per 100K (Table 1 , Figure 1 ). Rates may increase as data by episode date become more complete. Incidence by health authority (HA) has stabilized or increased slightly since weeks 25 and 26 . As shown in Figure 2 , incidence increas ed from week 25 to week 28 in Interior Health (I H) from 10 to 15 per 100K . Incidence has stabilized since week 25 in Vancouver Coastal Health (VCH) at 6 per 100K and Island Health (VIHA) at 1 per 100K , and since week 26 in Fraser Health (FH) at ~6 per 100K and Northern Health (NHA) at ~1 per 100K per week . Regional increases were driven mainly by Kootenay Boundary health service delivery area (HS DA) which increased from 1 (week 24) to 42 (week 28) per 100K, and by North ern Interior which increased from 0 (week 26) to 3 (week 28) per 100K .

Likely sources of infection As shown in Table 2 and Figure 3 , domestic contact with a known case or cluster has been the most commonly reported source of infection across the pandemic to date.

Test rates and percent positive As shown by the darker -colore d bars in Figure 4 , testing of MSP -funded specimens has stabilised at in week 26 . Positivity of MSP -funded specimens has also stabilized at 2.0% in week 26 ; this is comparable to positivity in early Augus t 2020 (week 32, 2020) . As shown in Panel A of Figure 5 , the per capita testing rates for MSP -only specimens has been stable across HAs since week 26. As shown in Panel B, percent positivity for MSP -funded tests has been stable since week 26 for FH (~1.5%) and IH (~3.5%). From week 27 to 28 , positivity has slightly decreased in VCH from 2.4% to 1.8% and in VIHA from 1.3% to 0.8%, and has increased in NH from 1.1 to 3.1%. Figure 4.

Age profile - Testing and cases Testing rates and percent positivity by age group As shown by the bars in Figure 6 , testing rates in all age groups remained stable since week 26 , wit h the exception of the 80+ year -olds showing a decrease . The 80+ year -olds, however, continue to have the highest testing rate for week 28 at 628 per 100K. As shown by the black dots in Figure 6 , the percent positivi ty has shown recent stabilizations since week s 26 and 27 in all age groups. In week 28 , the percent positivity was highest in the 20 -39 year -olds at 3.0%, followed by the 15 -19 and 40 -59 year age groups, which were comparable at ~2 .5%. Case distribution and weekly incidence by age group As shown in Figure 7 , recent fluctuations in the proportion of affected age groups reflect small case counts, which are more pronounced starting week 22. Generally, adults between 20 and 49 years of age comprise half of the cases. As shown in Figure 8, age-specific incidences have been generally stable since week 25 with minor changes in trends in some age groups: the 20 -29 year -olds have increased since week 25 from 11 to 15 per 100K (highest incidence in week 28 ); the 30 - 39 and 40 -49 have increased since week 26 from 7 to 10 per 100K and 5 to 8 per 100K, respectively; and the <10, 15 -19, and 60-69 year -olds have decreased since week 27 from 6 to 3, 12 t o 8, and 4 to 2 per 100K, respectively .

The 70+ year -olds were eligible between weeks 10 and 14 , the 40 to 69 year - olds started in weeks 15 -19, the 20 to 39 year -olds started in weeks 19 -20, and children 12 -19 years of age started in week 20. As vaccination coverage increas es, case counts are expected to decrease a few weeks later (Figure 9 ). By week 28, the overall single -dose vaccination coverage in the eligible 12+ year -olds reached 80%, and 52% in the fully vaccinated. The single -dose coverag e for age groups 50+ years of age ranged from 81 -90%, and two-dose coverage ranged from 63 -85%, with 58 cases reported for those age groups combined. For younger adults, s ingle -dose coverage in the 20-49 year -olds was between 74 -80%, and two -dose coverage ranged between 28-52% , with 237 cases reported for those age groups combined .

Severe outcome counts and epi -curve The number of weekly hospital admissions peak ed in week 15 (383 ) and has declined by 96 % since then, r eaching 16 admissions in week 28 . (Table 3 , Figure 9 ). Intensive care unit (ICU) admissions decreased by 98 % since week 15 (107 admissions), re aching 2 admissions in week 28 . The number of deaths decreased by 93% since week 19 (31 deaths) with 2 deaths reported in week 28 . These numbers may increase in future reports as more data become available. Cumulatively, there have been 16 confirmed cases of Multi -system Inflammatory Syndrome in children and adolescents (MIS - C) in BC from January 1, 2020 to week 28 . No ne w cases were reported in week 28 . The me dian age of these cases is 7 (range 1-15) years. Table 3.

In week 28 , median age of hospital admissions, ICU admissions and deaths was 58 years, 42 years a nd 89 years, respectively, based on health authority case line lists only (data not shown). As shown in Figure 11 , since week 23, death counts have been low and stable in elderly adults with an average of 2 deaths per week in each of the 80+ year -olds and the 70 -79-year -olds, and 1 in each of the 60 -69-year -olds and the 50 -59-year -olds.
