Acupuncture We're honored to offer you both Traditional and Esoteric Acupuncture. One focuses on the physical, mental, and emotional, while the other addresses the spirit. Acupuncture is a natural and non-invasive method of treatment. Tiny needles achieving big results. Donation-based Community Clinic We firmly believe that wellness is not a luxury. So many people can benefit from our services, but unfortunately, there are many circumstances that make it difficult to access. Thus, our community clinic was born! This is a monthly offering for YOU! Each month we host this community clinic, all donation based only; pay what you can. Then, we donate 50% of the proceeds to a different organization each month. Everyone wins! Events & Workshops Intimate. Communal. Magical. Our events are so dear to us. We meticulously curate each and every gathering with you in mind. We hope to see you at the next one.
