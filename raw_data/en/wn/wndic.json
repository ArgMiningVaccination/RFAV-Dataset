Wolfert, General Counsel 389 South 1300 West Pleasant Grove, Utah 84062 Warning Regarding Health and Earnings Claims Related to Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) Dear Mr. Wolfert, FTC staff has reviewed social media pos ts made by doTERRA International, LLC (\"doTERRA\") business opportunity part icipants or representatives th at unlawfully advertise that certain products treat or prevent Coronaviru s Disease 2019 (COVID-19) and misrepresent that consumers who become doTERRA business oppor tunity participants are likely to earn substantial income. This letter is to provide you with information about laws and regulations enforced by the Federal Trade Commission (\"FTC\") that may bear upon your business activities, including the activities of your business opportunity particip ants and representatives. Some examples of Coronavirus prevention or treatment claims made by your business opportunity participants or representatives include: \"...

Some examples of earnings claims made by your business opportunity participants or representatives include: \"For those of you working from home now, who says you ever have to go back? With a little education and a lot of upl ifting support... you can take your health and your career future into your own hands.\" \"Need to make extra money? Find it difficult to pay your bills?

Msg Act, 15 U.S.C. \u00a7 41 et seq ., to advertise that a product can prevent, treat, or cure human disease unless you possess competent and reliable scientific evidence, including, when a ppropriate, well-controlled human clin ical studies, s ubstantiating that the claims are true at the tim e they are made. For COVID-19, no such study is currently known to exist for the products identified above. Thus, any coronavirus-related prevention or treatment claims regarding such products are not supported by competent and reliable scientific evidence. You must immediately cease making all such claims. Additionally, representations about a business opportunity, including earnings claims, violate Section 5 of the FTC Act, 15 U.S.C. \u00a7 41 et seq ., if they are false, misleading, or unsubstantiated and material to consumers. Expre ss and implied earnings claims must be truthful and non-misleading to avoid being deceptive, whic h means that claims about the potential to achieve a wealthy lifestyle, career -level income, or significant income are false or misleading if business opportunity participan ts generally do not achieve su ch results. Even truthful testimonials from participants who do earn signifi cant income or more will likely be misleading unless the advertising also makes clear the amount earned or lost by most participants. Your business opportunity participants and representatives must immediately cease making all express and implied earnings claims that would be fa lse or misleading to current or prospective participants. You are responsible for the claims of your business opportunity participants and representatives. As the FT C stated in the January 2019 Business Guidance Concerning Multi- Level Marketing , the compensation structure of a Mult i-Level Marketing entity (\"MLM\") may create incentives for its participants to make certain representations to current or prospective participants. \"As a consequence, an MLM should (i) direct its part icipants not to make false, misleading, or unsubstantiated representations and (ii) monitor its partic ipants so they don't make false, misleading, or uns ubstantiated representations.\" You are advised to review all claims rela ting to your products and business opportunity and immediately cease, and require your business opportunity particip ants and representatives to cease, making claims that are not supported by the evidence or substantiation described above. 2 Within 48 hours, please send reply via email to COVID-19-Task-Force @ftc.gov describing the specific actions you have taken to address the FTC's concerns.
