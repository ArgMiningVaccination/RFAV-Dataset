Read this entire provision to understand a Covere d Person's COBRA rights and obligations. The following is a summary of the federal continuat ion requirements under the Consolidated Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act of 1985 (COBRA), as amend ed. This summary generally explains COBRA continuation coverage, when it may become available to You and Your family, and what You and Your Dependents need to do to protect the right to recei ve it. This summary provides a general notice of a Covered Person's rights under COBRA, but is not int ended to satisfy all of the requirements of federal law. Your employer or the COBRA Administrator will provide additional information to You or Your Dependents as required. The COBRA Administrator for this Plan is: WESTLAKE FINANCIAL GROUP, INC. INTRODUCTION Federal law gives certain persons, known as Qualifi ed Beneficiaries (defined below), the right to cont inue their health care benefits beyond the date that the y might otherwise terminate. The Qualified Benefic iary must pay the entire cost of the COBRA continuation coverage, plus an administrative fee. In general, a Qualified Beneficiary has the same rights and oblig ations under the Plan as an active participant. A Qualified Beneficiary may elect to continue cover age under this Plan if such person's coverage would terminate because of a life event known as a Qualif ying Event, outlined below. When a Qualifying Even t causes (or will cause) a Loss of Coverage, then the Plan must offer COBRA continuation coverage. Loss of Coverage means more than losing coverage entirel y. It means that a person ceases to be covered under the same terms and conditions that are in eff ect immediately before the Qualifying Event. In sh ort, a Qualifying Event plus a Loss of Coverage allows a Qualified Beneficiary the right to elect coverage under COBRA. Generally, You, Your covered spouse, and Your Depen dent Children may be Qualified Beneficiaries and eligible to elect COBRA continuation coverage even if the person is already covered under another employer-sponsored group health plan or is enrolled in Medicare at the time of the COBRA election. COBRA CONTINUATION COVERAGE FOR QUALIFIED BENEFICIA RIES The length of COBRA continuation coverage that is o ffered varies based on who the Qualified Beneficiar y is and what Qualifying Event is experienced as outlined below. An Employee will become a Qualified Beneficiary if coverage under the Plan is lost because either one of the following Qualifying Events happens: Qualifying Event Length of Continuation Your employment ends for any reason other than You r gross misconduct up to 18 months Your hours of employment are reduced up to 18 months (There are two ways in which this 18-month period o f COBRA continuation coverage can be extended. See the section below entitled \"The Right to Extend Coverage\" for more information.) 10-01-2011/01-23-2012 -35- 7670-00-411139 The spouse of an Employee will become a Qualified B eneficiary if coverage is lost under the Plan because any of the following Qualifying Events happ en: Qualifying Event Length of Continuation Your spouse dies up to 36 months Your spouse's hours of employment are reduced up to 18 months Your spouse's employment ends for any reason other than his or her gross misconduct up to 18 months Your spouse becomes entitled to Medicare benefits (under Part A, Part B, or both) up to 36 months You become divorced or legally separated from Your spouse up to 36 months The Dependent Children of an Employee become Qualif ied Beneficiaries if coverage is lost under the Plan because any of the following Qualifying Events happen: Qualifying Event Length of Continuation The parent-Employee dies up to 36 months The parent-Employee's employment ends for any reas on other than his or her gross misconduct up to 18 months The parent-Employee's hours of employment are redu ced up to 18 months The parent-Employee becomes entitled to Medicare b enefits (Part A, Part B, or both) up to 36 months The parents become divorced or legally separated up to 36 months The Child stops being eligible for coverage under the plan as a Dependent up to 36 months Note: A spouse or Dependent Child newly acquired ( newborn or adopted) during a period of continuation coverage is eligible to be enrolled as a Dependent. The standard enrollment provision of the Plan applies to enrollees during c ontinuation coverage. A Dependent, other than a newborn or newly adopted Child, acquired and enro lled after the original Qualifying Event, is not eligible as a Qualified Beneficiary if a subsequent Qualifying Event occurs. COBRA NOTICE PROCEDURES THE NOTICE(S) A COVERED PERSON MUST PROVIDE UNDER T HIS SUMMARY PLAN DESCRIPTION To be eligible to receive COBRA continuation covera ge, covered Employees and their Dependents have certain obligations with respect to certain Qualify ing Events (including divorce or legal separation o f the Employee and spouse or a Dependent Child's loss of eligibility for coverage as a Dependent) to provide written notices to the administrator. Follow the r ules described in this procedure when providing not ice to the administrators, either Your employer or the COB RA Administrator.

In order to protect Yo ur family's rights, the Plan Administrator should b e informed of any changes in the addresses of family members. Keep a copy of any notices sent to the Plan Administrator or COBRA Administrator. COBRA NOTICE REQUIREMENTS AND ELECTION PROCESS EMPLOYER OBLIGATION TO PROVIDE NOTICE OF THE QUALIF YING EVENT Your employer will give notice to the COBRA Adminis trator when coverage terminates due to Qualifying Events that are the Employee's termination of emplo yment or reduction in hours, death of the Employee, or the Employee becoming entitled to Medicare benef its due to age or disability (Part A, Part B, or bo th). Your employer will notify the COBRA Administrator w ithin 30 calendar days when these events occur. EMPLOYEE OBLIGATION TO PROVIDE NOTICE OF THE QUALIF YING EVENT The Covered Person must give notice to the Plan Adm inistrator in the case of other Qualifying Events t hat are divorce or legal separation of the Employee and a spouse, a Dependent Child ceasing to be eligible for coverage under the Plan, or a second Qualifying Event. The covered Employee or Qualified Beneficiary must provide written notice to the Plan Administrator in order to ensure rights to COBRA continuation coverage. The Covered Person must pro vide this notice within the 60-calendar day period that begins on the latest of: The date of the Qualifying Event; or The date on which there is a Loss of Coverage (or would lose coverage); or The date on which the Qualified Beneficiary is inf ormed of this notice requirement by receiving this Summary Plan Description or the General COBRA Notic e. The Plan Administrator will notify the COBRA Admini strator within 30 calendar days from the date that notice of the Qualifying Event has been provided. The COBRA Administrator will, in turn, provide an e lection notice to each Qualified Beneficiary within 14 calendar days of receiving notice of a Qualifying E vent from the employer, covered Employee or the Qualified Beneficiary. MAKING AN ELECTION TO CONTINUE GROUP HEALTH COVERAG E Each Qualified Beneficiary has the independent righ t to elect COBRA continuation coverage. A Qualifie d Beneficiary will receive a COBRA election form that must be completed to elect to continue group healt h coverage under this Plan. A Qualified Beneficiary may elect COBRA coverage at any time within the 60- day election period. The election period ends 60 c alendar days after the later of: The date Plan coverage terminates due to a Qualify ing Event; or The date the Plan Administrator provides the Quali fied Beneficiary with an election notice. A Qualified Beneficiary must notify the COBRA Admin istrator of their election in writing to continue g roup health coverage and must make the required payments when due in order to remain covered. If the Qualified Beneficiary does not choose COBRA continu ation coverage within the 60-day election period, group health coverage will end on the day of the Qu alifying Event. 10-01-2011/01-23-2012 -37- 7670-00-411139 PAYMENT OF CLAIMS AND DATE COVERAGE BEGINS No claims will be paid under this Plan for services the Qualified Beneficiary receives on or after the date coverage is lost due to a Qualifying Event. If, ho wever, the Qualified Beneficiary has not completed a waiver and decides to elect COBRA continuation cove rage within the 60-day election period, group healt h coverage will be reinstated back to the date covera ge was lost, provided that the Qualified Beneficiar y makes the required payment when due. Any claims th at were denied during the initial COBRA election period will be reprocessed once the COBRA Administr ator receives the completed COBRA election form and required payment. If a Qualified Beneficiary previously waived COBRA coverage but revokes that waiver within the 60-day election period, coverage will not be retroactive t o the date of the Qualifying Event but instead will be effective on the date the waiver is revoked. PAYMENT FOR CONTINUATION COVERAGE Qualified Beneficiaries are required to pay the ent ire cost of continuation coverage, which includes b oth the employer and Employee contribution. This may a lso include a 2% additional fee to cover administrative expenses (or in the case of the 11-m onth extension due to disability, a 50% additional fee). Fees are subject to change at least once a year. If Your employer offers annual open enrollment oppo rtunities for active Employees, each Qualified Beneficiary will have the same options under COBRA (for example, the right to add or eliminate coverag e for Dependents). The cost of continuation coverage will be adjusted accordingly. The initial payment is due no later than 45 calendar days after the Qu alified Beneficiary elects COBRA as evidenced by the postmark date on the envelope. This first payment must cover the cost of continuation coverage from the time coverage under the Plan would have otherwise terminated, up to the time the first payment is made. If the initial pay ment is not made within the 45-day period, then cov erage will remain terminated without the possibility of r einstatement. There is no grace period for the ini tial payment. The due date for subsequent payments is typically the first day of the month for any pa rticular period of coverage, however the Qualified Beneficiary will re ceive specific payment information including due dates, when the Qualified Beneficiary becomes eligi ble for and elects COBRA continuation coverage. If, for whatever reason, any Qualified Beneficiary receives any benefits under the Plan during a month for which the payment was not made on time, then the Qu alified Beneficiary will be required to reimburse t he Plan for the benefits received. If the COBRA Administrator receives a check that is missing information or has discrepancies regarding the information on the check (i.e., the numeric dol lar amount does not match the written dollar amount ), the COBRA Administrator will provide a notice to th e Qualified Beneficiary and allow him/her 14 days t o send in a corrected check. If a corrected check is not received within the 14-day timeframe, then the occurrence will be treated as non-payment and the Q ualified Beneficiary(s) will be termed from the Pla n in accordance with the plan language above. Note: Payment will not be considered made if a che ck is returned for non-sufficient funds. A QUALIFIED BENEFICIARY'S NOTICE OBLIGATIONS WHILE ON COBRA Always keep the COBRA Administrator informed of the current addresses of all Covered Persons who are or who may become Qualified Beneficiaries. Failure to provide this information to the COBRA Administrator may cause You or Your Dependents to l ose important rights under COBRA. 10-01-2011/01-23-2012 -38- 7670-00-411139 In addition, after any of the following events occu r, written notice to the COBRA Administrator is req uired within 30 calendar days of: The date any Qualified Beneficiary marries.

LENGTH OF CONTINUATION COVERAGE COBRA coverage is available up to the maximum perio ds described below, subject to all COBRA regulations and the conditions of this Summary Plan Description: For Employees and Dependents . 18 months from the Qualifying Event if due to th e Employee's termination of employment or reduction of work hour s. (If an active Employee enrolls in Medicare before his or her termination of employment or redu ction in hours, then the covered spouse and Dependent Children would be entitled to COBRA conti nuation coverage for up to the greater of 18 months from the Employee's termination of employmen t or reduction in hours, or 36 months from the earlier Medicare Enrollment Date, whether or no t Medicare enrollment is a Qualifying Event.) For Dependents only . 36 months from the Qualifying Event if coverage is lost due to one of the following events: /head2right Employee's death. /head2right Employee's divorce or legal separation. /head2right Former Employee becomes enrolled in Medicare. /head2right A Dependent Child no longer being a Dependent as d efined in the Plan. THE RIGHT TO EXTEND THE LENGTH OF COBRA CONTINUATIO N COVERAGE While on COBRA continuation coverage, certain Quali fied Beneficiaries may have the right to extend continuation coverage provided that written notice to the COBRA Administrator is given as soon as possible but no later than the required timeframes stated below. Social Security Disability Determination (For Emplo yees and Dependents) : A Qualified Beneficiary may be granted an 11-month extension to the initial 18-month COBRA continuation period, for a total maximum of 29 months of COBRA in the event that the Social Security Administration determines the Qualified Beneficiary to be disabled some time befo re the 60 th day of COBRA continuation coverage. This extension will not apply if the original COBRA continuation was for 36 months. If the Qualified Beneficiary has non-disabled famil y members who are also Qualifying Beneficiaries, th ose non-disabled family members are also entitled to th e disability extension. 10-01-2011/01-23-2012 -39- 7670-00-411139 The Qualified Beneficiary must give the COBRA Admin istrator a copy of the Social Security Administration letter of disability determination w ithin 60 days of the later of: The date of the SSA disability determination; The date the Qualifying Event occurs; The date the Qualified Beneficiary loses (or would lose) coverage due to the Qualifying Event or the date that Plan coverage was lost; or The date on which the Qualified Beneficiary is inf ormed of the requirement to notify the COBRA Administrator of the disability by receiving this S ummary Plan Description or the General COBRA Notice. Note: Premiums may be higher after the initial 18- month period for persons exercising this disability extension provision available under COBRA. If the Social Security Administration determines th e Qualified Beneficiary is no longer disabled, the Qualified Beneficiary must notify the Plan of that fact within 30 days after the Social Security Administration's determination. Second Qualifying Events: (Dependents Only) If Your family experiences another Qualifying Even t while receiving 18 months of COBRA continuation cov erage, the spouse and Dependent Children in Your family who are Qualified Beneficiaries can receive up to 18 additional months of COBRA continuation coverage, for a maximum of 36 months, if notice of the second event is provided to the COBRA Administrator. This additional coverage may be ava ilable to the spouse or Dependent Children who are Qualified Beneficiaries if the Employee or former E mployee dies, becomes entitled to Medicare (Part A, Part B or both) or is divorced or legally separated , or if the Dependent Child stops being eligible un der the Plan as a Dependent. This extension is available o nly if the Qualified Beneficiaries were covered und er the Plan prior to the original Qualifying Event. A Dependent acquired during COBRA continuation (othe r than newborns and newly adopted Children) is not el igible to continue coverage as the result of a subsequent Qualifying Event. These events will onl y lead to the extension when the event would have caused the spouse or Dependent Child to lose covera ge under the Plan had the first qualifying event no t occurred. You or Your Dependents must provide the notice of a second Qualifying Event to the COBRA Administrator within a 60-day period that begins to run on the latest of: The date of the second Qualifying Event; or The date the Qualified Beneficiary loses (or would lose) coverage due to the second Qualifying Event; or The date on which the Qualified Beneficiary is inf ormed of the requirement to notify the COBRA Administrator of the second Qualifying Event by rec eiving this Summary Plan Description or the General COBRA Notice. EARLY TERMINATION OF COBRA CONTINUATION COBRA continuation coverage may terminate before th e end of the above maximum coverage periods for any of the following reasons: The employer ceases to maintain a group health pla n for any Employees. (Note that if the employer terminates the group health plan that the Qualified Beneficiary is under, but still maintains another group health plan for other similarly-situa ted Employees, the Qualified Beneficiary will be offered COBRA continuation coverage under the remai ning group health plan, although benefits and costs may not be the same). The required contribution for the Qualified Benefi ciary's coverage is not paid within the timeframe expressed in the COBRA regulations. 10-01-2011/01-23-2012 -40- 7670-00-411139 After electing COBRA continuation coverage, the Qu alified Beneficiary becomes entitled to and enrolled with Medicare. After electing COBRA continuation coverage, the Qu alified Beneficiary becomes covered under another group health plan that does not contain any exclusion or limitation with respect to any Pre-Existing Condition(s) for the beneficiary. The Qualified Beneficiary is found not to be disab led during the disability extension. The Plan will terminate the Qualified Beneficiary's COBRA continu ation coverage one month after the Social Security Administration makes a determination that the Qualified Beneficiary is no longer disabled. Termination for cause, such as submitting fraudule nt claims. SPECIAL NOTICE (Read This If Thinking Of Declining COBRA Continuation Coverage) Electing COBRA continuation coverage now may protec t some of Your (or Your Dependent's) rights if You or Your Dependent need to obtain an individual health insurance policy soon. The Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA ) requires that all health insurance carriers who o ffer coverage in the individual market must accept any e ligible individuals who apply for coverage without imposing Pre-Existing Condition exclusions, under c ertain conditions. Some of those conditions pertai n to COBRA continuation coverage. To take advantage of this HIPAA right, COBRA continuation coverage under this Plan must be elected and maintained (by paying the cost of coverage) for the duration of th e COBRA continuation period. In the event that an in dividual health insurance policy is needed, You or Your Dependent must apply for coverage with an indi vidual insurance carrier after COBRA continuation coverage is exhausted and before a 63-day break in coverage. If You or Your Dependent will be obtaining group health coverage through a new employer, keep in mind that HIPAA requires employers to reduce Pre-Ex isting Condition exclusion periods if there is less than a 63-day break in health coverage (Creditable Coverage). HEALTH COVERAGE TAX CREDIT PROGRAM (HCTC) The Trade Act of 2002 created a new health coverage tax credit for certain individuals who become eligible for trade adjustment assistance. Trade ad justment assistance is generally available to only a limited group of individuals who have lost their jo bs or suffered a reduction in hours as a result of import competition or shifts of production to other countr ies. Under the new tax provisions, eligible indivi duals can either take a tax credit or get advance payment of 65% of premiums paid for qualified health insurance, including COBRA continuation coverage. If You have questions about these new tax provisions, You may call the Health Coverage Tax Cr edit Customer Contact Center toll-free at 1-866-628-4282. TTD/TTY callers may call toll-free at 1-866-626-4282. More information about the Trade Act is available at www.doleta.gov/tradeact/2 002act_index.cfm. Special COBRA rights apply to certain Employees who are eligible for the health coverage tax credit. These Employees are entitled to a second opportunit y to elect COBRA coverage during a special second election period (if the Employee did not elect COBR A coverage already). The special second COBRA election period lasts 60 days or less, beginning on the first day of the month in which the Employee becomes an eligible HCTC recipient, but the electio n must also be made within six months after the ini tial loss of group health coverage. As a result, if the Employee finds out that he or she is eligible for this program with fewer than 60 days remaining in the si x month period after initial loss of group health coverage, then this second election period will be less than 60 days. The Employee must send the COBRA Administrator a copy of the confirmation lett er from HCTC or the State Workforce Agency, stating the effective date of eligibility under this progra m. 10-01-2011/01-23-2012 -41- 7670-00-411139 COBRA coverage elected during the special second el ection period is not retroactive. Coverage begins on the date that the special second election period begins, and the maximum COBRA coverage period will end on the same day it would have ended if COB RA coverage had been elected during the regular 60-day election period. There is no retroactive co verage for the gap period from the initial loss of coverage to the first day of the special second ele ction period. For example, if an Employee's covera ge ends on June 30 due to termination of employment, a nd the Employee elects COBRA coverage during a second 60-day election period that begins on Novemb er 1, the person would have no coverage from July 1 to October 31. COBRA coverage would start o n November 1 and would end 14 months later because the maximum COBRA coverage period would exp ire 18 months from loss of coverage due to termination of employment. For purposes of Pre-Exi sting Condition exclusions, the Plan will not count any days between the initial loss of group health c overage and the first day of the special second ele ction period as part of a 63-day Significant Break in Cov erage. DEFINITIONS Qualified Beneficiary means a person covered by this group health Plan i mmediately before the Qualifying Event who is the Employee, the spouse of a covered Employee or the Dependent Child of a covered Employee. This includes a Child who is bor n to or Placed for Adoption with a covered Employee during the Employee's COBRA coverage period if the Child is enrolled within the Plan's Special Enrollment Provision for newborns and adopted Child ren. This also includes a Child who was receiving benefits under this Plan pursuant to a Qualified Me dical Child Support Order (QMCSO) immediately before the Qualifying Event. Qualifying Event means Loss of Coverage due to one of the following : The death of the covered Employee. Voluntary or involuntary termination of the covere d Employee's employment (other than for gross misconduct). A reduction in work hours of the covered Employee. Divorce or legal separation of the covered Employe e from the Employee's spouse. (Also, if an Employee terminates coverage for his or her spouse in anticipation of a divorce or legal separation, and a divorce or legal separation later occurs, the n the later divorce or legal separation may be considered a Qualifying Event even though the ex-sp ouse lost coverage earlier. If the ex-spouse notifies the Plan or the COBRA Administrator in wri ting within 60 calendar days after the divorce or legal separation and can establish that the coverag e was originally eliminated in anticipation of the divorce or legal separation, then COBRA coverage ma y be available for the period after the divorce or legal separation). The covered former Employee becomes enrolled in Me dicare. A Dependent Child no longer being a Dependent as d efined by the Plan. Loss of Coverage means any change in the terms or conditions of cove rage in effect immediately before the Qualifying Event. Loss of Coverage includes ch ange in coverage terms, change in plans, terminatio n of coverage, partial Loss of Coverage, increase in Employee cost, as well as other changes that affect terms or conditions of coverage. Loss of Coverage does not always occur immediately after the Qualifying Event, but it must always occur within t he applicable 18- or 36-month coverage period. A L oss of Coverage that is not caused by a Qualifying Even t may not trigger COBRA. 10-01-2011/01-23-2012 -42- 7670-00-411139 UNIFORMED SERVICES EMPLOYMENT AND REEMPLOYMENT RIGH TS ACT OF 1994 INTRODUCTION Employers are required to offer COBRA-like health c are continuation coverage to persons in the armed service if the absence for military duty would resu lt in loss of coverage as a result of active duty. Employees on leave for military service must be tre ated like they are on leave of absence and are enti tled to any other rights and benefits accorded to simila rly situated Employees on leave of absence or furlo ugh. If an employer has different types of benefits avai lable depending on the type of leave of absence, th e most favorable comparable leave benefits must apply to Employees on military leave. Reinstatement following the military leave of absence cannot be s ubject to Pre-Existing Conditions and Waiting Perio ds. COVERAGE The maximum length of health care continuation cove rage required under USERRA is the lesser of: 24 months beginning on the day that the Uniformed Service leave begins, or a period beginning on the day that the Service lea ve begins and ending on the day after the Employee fails to return to or reapply for employme nt within the time allowed by USERRA. USERRA NOTICE AND ELECTION An Employee or an appropriate officer of the unifor med service in which his or her service is to be performed must notify the employer that the Employe e intends to leave the employment position to perform service in the uniformed services. An Empl oyee should provide notice as far in advance as is reasonable under the circumstances. The Employee i s excused from giving notice due to military necessity, or if it is otherwise impossible or unre asonable under all the circumstances. Upon notice of intent to leave for uniformed servic es, Employees will be given the opportunity to elec t USERRA continuation. Dependents do not have an ind ependent right to elect USERRA coverage. Election, payment and termination of the USERRA ext ension will be governed by the same requirements set forth under the COBRA Section, to the extent th ese COBRA requirements do not conflict with USERRA. PAYMENT If the military leave orders are for a period of 30 days or less, the Employee is not required to pay more than the amount he or she would have paid as an act ive Employee. For periods of 31 days or longer, if an Employee elects to continue health coverage purs uant to USERRA, such Employee and covered Dependents will be required to pay up to 102% of th e full premium for the coverage elected. EXTENDED COVERAGE RUNS CONCURRENT Employees and their Dependents may be eligible for both COBRA and USERRA at the same time. Election of either the COBRA or USERRA extension by an Employee on leave for military service will be deemed an election under both laws, and the coverag e offering the most benefit to the Employee will generally be extended. Coverage under both laws wi ll run concurrently. Dependents who choose to independently elect extended coverage will only be deemed eligible for COBRA extension because they are not eligible for a separate, independent right of election under USERRA. 10-01-2011/01-23-2012C -43- 7670-00-411139 PROVIDER NETWORK Effective: 01-01-2013 The word \"Network\" means an outside organization that has contracted with various providers to provide health care services to Covered Persons at a Negoti ated Rate. Providers who participate in a Network have agreed to accept the negotiated fees as paymen t in full, including any portion of the fees that t he Covered Person must pay due to the Deductible, Part icipation amounts or other out-of-pocket expenses. The allowable charges used in the calculation of th e payable benefit to participating providers will b e determined by the Negotiated Rates in the network c ontract. A provider who does not participate in a Network may bill Covered Persons for additional fee s over and above what the Plan pays. Knowing which Network a provider belongs to will he lp a Covered Person to determine how much he or she will need to pay for certain services. To obta in the highest level of benefits under this Plan, C overed Persons need to see an In-Network provider, however this Plan does not limit a Covered Person's right to choose his or her own provider of medical care at h is or her own expense if a medical expense is not a Covered Expense under this Plan, or is subject to a limitation or exclusion. To find out which Network a provider belongs to, pl ease refer to the Provider Directory, or call the t oll-free number that is listed on the back of the Plan's ide ntification card. The participation status of prov iders may change from time to time. If a provider belongs to one of the following Netw orks, claims for Covered Expenses will normally be processed in accordance with the In-Network benefit levels that are listed on the Schedule of Benefits: 58 - UnitedHealthcare Options PPO Network If a provider belongs to one of the following Netw orks, claims for Covered Expenses will normally be processed in accordance with the Out-of-Network benefit levels that are listed on the Schedule of Benefits, but the providers have agreed to disco unt their fees. This means that the Covered Person may pay a little less for a particular claim than they would for an Out-of-Network claim. XZ - First Health Shared Savings For services received from any other provider, cla ims for Covered Expenses will normally be processed in accordance with the Out-of-Network benefit levels that are listed on the Schedule of Benefits. These providers charge their normal rate s for services, so Covered Persons may need to pay more. The Covered Person is responsible for pa ying the balance of these claims after the Plan pays its portion, if any. For Transplant Services at a Designated Transplant Facility the Preferred Provider Organization is: Chartis EXCEPTIONS TO THE PROVIDER NETWORK RATES Some benefits may be processed at In-Network benefi t levels when provided by an Out-of-Network provider. When Non-Network charges are covered in accordance with Network benefits, the charges are still subject to the Usual and Customary charge lim itations. The following exceptions may apply: Covered Services provided by a Physician during an Inpatient stay will be payable at the In- Network level of benefits when provided at an In-Ne twork Hospital. If there is not a Tier 1 or Tier 2 provider, or no Tier 1 or Tier 2 provider is willing or able to pr ovide the necessary service(s) in the specialty that the Covered Person is seeking within a 45 mile radius of the Covered Person's residence, then the Tier 3 charges will be processed as Tier 2 charges so long as the Covered Person provides appropriate doc umentation. 10-01-2011/01-23-2012C -44- 7670-00-411139 The In-Network level of benefits may be applied wh en an Out-of-Network provider is used during a true Emergency, provided the Out-of-Network provide r is the closest medically-appropriate provider and a transfer to an In-Network provider occurs as soon as medically appropriate . Covered Services provided by a radiologist, anesth esiologist, certified registered nurse anesthetist or pathologist for routine mammograms and colonosco pies when services are provided at a Tier 1 facility will be payable at In Network level of ben efits when rendered by a Tier 2 or Tier 3 provider. Provider Directory Information Each covered Employee, those on COBRA, and Children or guardians of Children who are considered alternate recipients under a Qualified Medical Chil d Support Order, will automatically be given or electronically made available, a separate document, at no cost, that lists the participating Network providers for this Plan. The Employee should share this document with other covered individuals in Yo ur household. If a covered spouse or Dependent wants a separate provider list, they should make a writte n request to the Plan Administrator. The Plan Admini strator may make a reasonable charge to cover the cost of furnishing complete copies to the spouse or other covered Dependents. TRANSITIONAL CARE Certain eligible expenses that would have been cons idered at the PPO benefit level by the prior Claims Administrator but which are not considered at the P PO benefit level by the current Claims Administrato r may be paid at the applicable PPO benefit level if the Covered Person is currently under a treatment p lan by a Physician who was a member of this Plan's prev ious PPO but who is not a member of the Plan's current PPO in the Employee or Dependent's network area. In order to ensure continuity of care for certain medical conditions already under treatment, the PPO medical plan benefit level may continue fo r 90 days for conditions approved as transitional car e. Examples of medical conditions appropriate for consideration for transitional care include, but ar e not limited to: Cancer if under active treatment with chemotherapy and/or radiation therapy.

Utilization Management can determin e Medical Necessity, shorten Hospital stays, improve the quality of care, and reduce costs to the Covere d Person and the Plan. The Utilization Management pr ocedures include certain Prior Authorization requirements. The benefit amounts payable under the Schedule of B enefits of this SPD may be affected if the requirements described for Utilization Management a re not satisfied. Covered Persons should call the phone number on the back of the Plan identification card to request Prior Authorization at least two w eeks prior to a scheduled procedure in order to allow fo r fact gathering and independent medical review, if necessary. Special Note: The Covered Person will not be penalized for failur e to obtain Prior Authorization if a prudent layperson, who possesses an average knowl edge of health and medicine, could reasonably expect that the absence of immediate med ical attention would jeopardize the life or long-term health of the individual. However, Covered Persons who received care on thi s basis must contact the Utilization Review Organization (see be low) as soon as possible within 24 hours of the fir st business day after receiving care or Hospital admit tance. The Utilization Review Organization will th en review services provided within 48 hours of being c ontacted. This Plan complies with the Newborns and Mothers He alth Protection Act. The Prior Authorization requirement is not required for Hospital or Birthin g Center stays of 48 hours or less following a norm al vaginal delivery or 96 hours or less following a Ce sarean section. Prior Authorization may be require d for stays beyond 48 hours following a vaginal delivery or 96 hours following a Cesarean section. UTILIZATION REVIEW ORGANIZATION The Utilization Review Organization is: UMR CARE MANAGEMENT DEFINITIONS The following terms are used for the purpose of the Utilization Management section of this SPD. Refer to the Glossary of Terms section of this SPD for addit ional definitions. Prior Authorization is the process of determining benefit coverage prio r to service being rendered to an individual member. A determination is made based o n Medical Necessity criteria for services, tests or procedures that are appropriate and cost-effective for the member. This member-centric review evaluates the clinical appropriateness of requested services in terms of the type, frequency, extent a nd duration of stay. Utilization Management means an assessment of the facility in which the t reatment is being provided. It also includes a formal assessment of the effectiven ess and appropriateness of health care services and treatment plans. Such assessment can be conducted on a prospective basis (prior to treatment), concurrent basis (during treatment), or retrospecti ve basis (following treatment). SERVICES REQUIRING PRIOR AUTHORIZATION Prior authorization is not required for services at Newton Medical Center. Call the Utilization Management Organization before receiving services for the following: Inpatient stay in a Hospital or Extended Care Faci lity. Home Health Care. 10-01-2011/01-23-2012C -59- 7670-00-411139 Durable Medical Equipment over $1,500 or any Durab le Medical Equipment rentals over $500/month. Prosthetics over $1,000. All Inpatient stays for Mental Health Disorders, s ubstance abuse and chemical dependency and residential treatment facility.

Outpatient surgery at any hospital other than Newt on Medical Center. Behavioral Mental Health and substance abuse servi ces requiring 23 hour observations, partial hospitalizations, residential treatment and intensi ve outpatient therapy. This Plan includes benefits for human organ and ti ssue transplantation which require Notification from the Chartis Organ & Tissue Transplant Policy u nderwritten by A&H Corporate Benefits. These benefits are fully explained in the Chartis Organ & Tissue Transplant Policy. Note that if a Covered Person receives Prior Author ization for one facility, but then the person is transferred to another facility, Prior Authorizatio n is also needed before going to the new facility, except in the case of an Emergency (see Special Not es above). PENALTIES FOR NOT OBTAINING PRIOR AUTHORIZATION A non-Prior Authorization penalty is the amount tha t must be paid by a Covered Person who does not cal l for Prior Authorization prior to receiving certain services. A penalty of $250 for Tier 2 and Tier 3 will be applied to applicable claims if a Covered Person re ceives services but did not obtain the required Pri or Authorization for: Inpatient stay in a Hospital or Extended Care Faci lity. Organ and tissue transplants. Home Health Care. Durable Medical Equipment over $1500 or any Durabl e Medical Equipment rentals over $500/month. Prosthetics over $1,000. All Inpatient stays for Mental Health Disorders, s ubstance abuse and chemical dependency and residential treatment facility. Inpatient stay in a Hospital or Birthing Center th at is longer than 48 hours following a normal vagin al delivery or 96 hours following a Cesarean section. Hospice. Outpatient surgery at any hospital other than Newt on Medical Center. Behavioral Mental Health and substance abuse servi ces requiring 23 hour observations, partial hospitalizations, residential treatment and intensi ve outpatient therapy. This Plan includes benefits for human organ and ti ssue transplantation which require Notification from the Chartis Organ & Tissue Transplant Policy u nderwritten by A&H Corporate Benefits. These benefits are fully explained in the Chartis Organ & Tissue Transplant Policy. The phone number to call for Prior Authorization is listed on the back of the Plan identification card. Even though a Covered Person provides Prior Authori zation from the Utilization Review Organization, that does not guarantee that this Plan will pay for the medical care. The Covered Person still needs to be eligible for coverage on the date services are prov ided. Coverage is also subject to all of the provi sions described in this SPD. Medical Director Oversight . A UMR Care Management medical director oversees the concurrent review process. Should a case have unique circumst ances that raise questions for the Utilization Management specialist handling the case, the medica l director will review the case to determine medica l appropriateness using evidence-based clinical crite ria. 10-01-2011/01-23-2012 -60- 7670-00-411139 Case Management Referrals . During the Prior Authorization review process, c ases are analyzed for a number of criteria used to trigger case to case man agement for review. These triggers include ICD-9 diagnosis codes, CPT codes and length-of-stay crite ria, as well as specific criteria requested by the Plan Administrator. Information is easily passed from U tilization Management to case management through our fully-integrated care management software syste m. All Prior Authorization requests are used to identi fy the member's needs. Our goal is to intervene in the process as early as possible to determine the resou rces necessary to deliver clinical care in the most appropriate care setting. Retrospective Review . Retrospective review is conducted by Plan Admini strator request as long as the request is received within 30 days of the original determination. Retrospective reviews are performed according to our standard Prior Authorization polic ies and procedures. Other Medical Management Services Case Management Services are designed to identify catastrophic and complex Illnesses, transplants and trauma cases. UMR Care Management's case manag ement specialists identify, coordinate and negotiate rates for out-of-network services (where appropriate and allowed under the Plan) and help manage related costs by finding alternatives to cos tly Inpatient stays. Opportunities are identified from the Prior Authorization review process, national cr iteria and system flags based on ICD-9 diagnosis, C PT procedure code and potential high dollar claim crit eria. UMR Care Management works directly with the patient, family members, treating Physician and fac ility to mobilize appropriate resources for the Cov ered Person's care. Our philosophy is that quality care from the beginning of the serious Illness helps av oid major complications in the future. The Covered Per son can request that the Plan provide services and the Plan may also contact the Covered Person if the Plan believes case management services may be beneficial. NurseLine service is a 24/7 health information line that ass ists Covered Persons with medical-related questions and concerns. NurseLine gives Covered Persons access to highly trained regi stered nurses so they can receive guidance and support when making d ecisions about their health and/or the health of their Dependents. 10-01-2011/01-23-2012 -61- 7670-00-411139 COORDINATION OF BENEFITS Coordination of Benefits (COB) applies whenever a C overed Person has health coverage under more than one Plan, as defined below. It does not however, apply to prescription benefits . The purpose of coordinating benefits is to help Covered Persons pa y for Covered Expenses, but not to result in total benefits that are greater than the Covered Expenses Incurred. The order of benefit determination rules determine which plan will pay first (Primary Plan). The Prim ary Plan pays without regard to the possibility that an other plan may cover some expenses. A Secondary Plan pays for Covered Expenses after the Primary Pl an has processed the claim, and will reduce the benefits it pays so that the total payment between the Primary Plan and Secondary Plan does not exceed the Covered Expenses Incurred. Up to 100% of charg es Incurred may be paid between both plans. The Plan will coordinate benefits with the followin g types of medical or dental plans: Group health plans, whether insured or self-insure d. Hospital indemnity benefits in excess of $200 per day. Specified disease policies. Foreign health care coverage. Medical care components of group long-term care co ntracts such as skilled nursing care. Medical benefits under group or individual motor v ehicle policies. See order of benefit determination rules (below) for details. Medical benefits under homeowner's insurance polic ies. Medicare or other governmental benefits, as permit ted by law. See below. This does not include Medicaid. Each contract for coverage is considered a separate plan. If a plan has two parts and COB rules apply to only one of the two parts, each of the parts is tre ated as a separate plan. If a plan provides benefi ts in the form of services rather than cash payments, the rea sonable cash value of each service rendered will be considered an allowable expense and a benefit paid. When this Plan is secondary, and when not in confli ct with a network contract requiring otherwise, covered charges shall not include any amount that i s not payable under the primary plan as a result of a contract between the primary plan and a provider of service in which such provider agrees to accept a reduced payment and not to bill the Covered Person for the difference between the provider's contracte d amount and the provider's regular billed charge. ORDER OF BENEFIT DETERMINATION RULES The first of the following rules that apply to a Co vered Person's situation is the rule to use: The plan that has no coordination of benefits prov ision is considered primary. When medical payments are available under motor ve hicle insurance (including no-fault policies), this Plan shall always be considered secondary rega rdless of the individual's election under PIP (Personal Injury Protection) coverage with the auto carrier. Where an individual is covered under one plan as a Dependent and another plan as an Employee, member or subscriber, the plan that covers the pers on as an Employee, member or subscriber (that is, other than as a Dependent) is considered primar y. The Primary Plan must pay benefits without regard to the possibility that another plan may cov er some expenses. This Plan will deem any Employee plan beneficiary to be eligible for primar y benefits from their employer's benefit plan. 10-01-2011/01-23-2012 -62- 7670-00-411139 Effective: 10-01-2012 The plan that covers a person as a Dependent (or b eneficiary under ERISA) is generally secondary. The plan that covers a person as a Depe ndent is primary only when both plans agree that COBRA or state continuation coverage should al ways pay secondary when the person who elected COBRA is covered by another plan as a Depen dent (see continuation coverage below). (Also see the section on Medicare, below, for excep tions). When an individual is covered under a spouse's Pla n and also under his or her parent's plan, the Primary Plan is the plan of the individual's spouse . The plan of the individual's parent(s) is the Secondary Plan. If one or more plans cover the same person as a De pendent Child: /head2right The Primary Plan is the plan of the parent whose b irthday is earlier in the year if: - The parents are married; or - The parents are not separated (whether or not they have been married); or - A court decree awards joint custody without specif ying that one party has the responsibility to provide health care coverage. - If both parents have the same birthday, the plan t hat covered either of the parents longer is primary. /head2right If the specific terms of a court decree state that one of the parents is responsible for the Child's health care expenses or health care coverag e and the plan of that parent has actual knowledge of those terms, that plan is primary. Th is rule applies to claim determination periods or plan years starting after the plan is gi ven notice of the court decree. /head2right If the parents are not married and reside separate ly, or are divorced or legally separated, the order of benefits is: - The plan of the custodial parent; - The plan of the spouse of the custodial parent; - The plan of the non-custodial parent; and then - The plan of the spouse of the non-custodial parent . Active or Inactive Employee: If an individual is covered under one plan as an active employee (or Dependent of an active employee), and is also cover ed under another plan as a retired or laid off employee (or Dependent of a retired or laid off emp loyee), the plan that covers the person as an active employee (or Dependent of an active employee ) will be primary. This rule does not apply if the rule in paragraph 3 (above) can determine the o rder of benefits. If the other plan does not have this rule, this rule is ignored. Continuation coverage under COBRA or state law: I f a person has elected continuation of coverage under COBRA or state law and also has cove rage under another plan, the continuation coverage is secondary. This is true even if the pe rson is enrolled in another plan as a Dependent. If the two plans do not agree on the order of benef its, this rule is ignored. This rule does not appl y if one of the first four bullets above applies. (See exception in the Medicare section.) Longer or Shorter Length of Coverage: The plan th at covered the person as an employee, member, subscriber or retiree longer is primary. If the above rules do not determine the Primary Pl an, the Covered Expenses can be shared equally between the plans. This Plan will not pay more tha n it would have paid, had it been primary. MEDICARE If You or Your covered spouse or Dependent is also receiving benefits under Medicare, including Medicare Prescription drug coverage, federal law ma y require this Plan to be primary over Medicare. When this Plan is not primary, the Plan will coordi nate benefits with Medicare. 10-01-2011/01-23-2012 -63- 7670-00-411139 The order of benefit determination rules determine which plan will pay first (Primary Plan). The Prim ary Plan pays without regard to the possibility that an other plan may cover some expenses. A Secondary Plan pays for Covered Expenses after the Primary Pl an has processed the claim, and will reduce the benefits it pays so that the total payment between the Primary Plan and Secondary Plan does not exceed the Covered Expenses Incurred. Up to 100% of charg es Incurred may be paid between both plans. When this Plan is not Primary and a Covered Person is receiving Part A Medicare but has chosen not to elect Part B, this Plan will reduce its payments on Part B services as though Part B Medicare was actu ally in effect. ORDER OF BENEFIT DETERMINATION RULES FOR MEDICARE This Plan complies with the Medicare Secondary Paye r regulations. Examples of these regulations are as follows: This Plan generally pays first under the following circumstances: /head2right You continue to be actively employed by the employ er and You or Your covered spouse becomes eligible for and enrolls in Medicare becaus e of age or disability. /head2right You continue to be actively employed by the employ er, Your covered spouse becomes eligible for and enrolls in Medicare, and is also c overed under a retiree plan through Your spouse's former employer. In this case, this Plan will be primary for You and Your covered spouse, Medicare pays second, and the retiree plan would pay last. /head2right For a Covered Person with End-Stage Renal Disease (ESRD), this Plan usually has primary responsibility for the claims of a Covered Person f or 30 months from the date of Medicare eligibility based on ESRD. The 30-month period can also include COBRA continuation coverage or another source of coverage. At the end of the 30 months, Medicare becomes the primary payer. Medicare generally pays first under the following circumstances: /head2right You are no longer actively employed by an employer ; and /head2right You or Your spouse has Medicare coverage due to ag e, plus You or Your spouse also have COBRA continuation coverage through the Plan; or /head2right You or a covered family member has Medicare covera ge based on a disability, plus You also have COBRA continuation coverage through the Plan. Medicare normally pays first, however an exception is that COBRA may pay first for Covere d Persons with ESRD until the end of the 30-month period; or /head2right You or Your covered spouse have retiree coverage p lus Medicare coverage; or /head2right Upon completion of 30 months of Medicare eligibili ty for an individual with ESRD, Medicare becomes the primary payer. (Note that if a person with ESRD was eligible for Medicare based on age or other disability before being diagnosed with ESRD and Medicare was previously paying primary, then the person can cont inue to receive Medicare benefits on a primary basis). Medicare is the secondary payer when no-fault insu rance, worker's compensation, or liability insurance is available as primary payer. Note: If a Covered Person is eligible for Medicare as the primary plan, all benefits from this Plan w ill be reduced by the amount Medicare would pay, regardles s of whether the Covered Person is enrolled in Medicare. 10-01-2011/01-23-2012 -64- 7670-00-411139 TRICARE In all instances where an eligible Employee is also a TRICARE beneficiary, TRICARE will pay secondary to this employer-provided Plan. RIGHT TO RECEIVE AND RELEASE NEEDED INFORMATION Certain facts about health care coverage and servic es are needed to apply these COB rules and to determine benefits payable under this Plan and othe r plans. The Plan may obtain the information it needs from or provide such information to other org anizations or persons for the purpose of applying those rules and determining benefits payable under this Plan and other plans covering the person claiming benefits. The Plan need not tell, or obta in the consent of, any person to do this. However, if the Plan needs assistance in obtaining the necessary in formation, each person claiming benefits under this Plan must provide the Plan any information it needs to apply those rules and determine benefits payabl e. REIMBURSEMENT TO THIRD PARTY ORGANIZATION A payment made under another plan may include an am ount which should have been paid under this Plan. If it does, the Plan may pay that amount to the organization which made that payment. That amount will then be treated as though it were a ben efit paid under this Plan. The Plan will not have to pay that amount again. RIGHT OF RECOVERY If the amount of the payments made by the Plan is m ore than it should have paid under this COB provision, the Plan may recover the excess from one or more of the persons it paid or for whom the Pla n has paid; or any other person or organization that may be responsible for the benefits or services provided for the Covered Person. 10-01-2011/01-23-2012 -65- 7670-00-411139 RIGHT OF SUBROGATION, REIMBURSEMENT, AND OFFSET Effective: 01-01-2013 The Plan has a right to subrogation and reimburseme nt. Subrogation applies when the Plan has paid Covered Expenses on Your behalf for an Illness or Injury fo r which a third party is considered responsible. The right to subrogation means that the Plan is substi tuted to and will succeed to any and all legal claims tha t You may be entitled to pursue against any third p arty for the Covered Expenses that the Plan has paid tha t are related to the Illness or Injury for which a third party is considered responsible. The right to reimbursement means that if a third pa rty causes or is alleged to have caused an Illness or Injury for which You receive a settlement, judgment , or other recovery from any third party, You must use those proceeds to fully return to the Plan 100% of any covered benefit you received for that Illness o r Injury. The following persons and entities are considered t hird parties: A person or entity alleged to have caused You to s uffer an Illness, Injury, or damages, or who is legally responsible for the Illness, Injury, or dam ages. Any insurer or other indemnifier of any person or entity alleged to have caused or who caused the Illness, Injury, or damages. The Plan Sponsor. Any person or entity who is or may be obligated to provide benefits or payments to You, including benefits or payments for underinsured or uninsured motorist protection, no-fault or traditional auto insurance, medical payment coverage (auto, homeowne rs', or otherwise), Workers' Compensation coverage, other insurance carriers, or third party administrators. Any person or entity that is liable for payment to You on any equitable or legal liability theory. You agree as follows: You will cooperate with the Plan in protecting the Plan's legal and equitable rights to subrogation and reimbursement in a timely manner, including, bu t not limited to: /head2right Notifying the Plan, in writing, of any potential l egal claim(s) You may have against any third party for acts that caused Covered Expenses to be p aid or become payable. /head2right Providing any relevant information requested by th e Plan. /head2right Signing and/or delivering such documents as the Pl an or our agents reasonably request to secure the subrogation and reimbursement claim. /head2right Responding to requests for information about any a ccident or Injuries. /head2right Making court appearances. /head2right Obtaining our consent or our agents' consent befor e releasing any party from liability or payment of medical expenses. /head2right Complying with the terms of this section. 10-01-2011/01-23-2012 -66- 7670-00-411139 Your failure to cooperate with the Plan is consider ed a breach of contract. As such, the Plan has the right to terminate Your covered benefits, deny future cov ered benefits, take legal action against You, and/o r set off from any future covered benefits the value of covered benefits we have paid relating to any Il lness or Injury alleged to have been caused or caused by any third party to the extent not recovered by the Plan due to You or Your representative not cooperating w ith the Plan. If the Plan incurs attorneys' fees a nd costs in order to collect third party settlement fu nds held by You or Your representative, the Plan ha s the right to recover those fees and costs from You. Yo u will also be required to pay interest on any amou nts You hold that should have been returned to the Plan . The Plan has a first priority right to receive pay ment on any claim against a third party before You receive payment from that third party. Further, ou r first priority right to payment is superior to an y and all claims, debts, or liens asserted by any med ical providers, including, but not limited to, Hospitals or Emergency treatment facilities, that a ssert a right to payment from funds payable from or recovered from an allegedly responsible third pa rty and/or insurance carrier. The Plan's subrogation and reimbursement rights ap ply to full and partial settlements, judgments, or other recoveries paid or payable to You or Your representative, no matter how those proceeds are captioned or characterized. Payments include, but are not limited to, economic, non-economic, and punitive damages. The Plan is not required to help You to pursue Your claim for damages or personal Injuries and no amount of associated costs , including attorneys' fees, will be deducted from our recovery without the Plan's express writte n consent. No so-called \"Fund Doctrine\" or \"Common-Fund Doctrine\" or \"Attorney's Fund Doctrine \" will defeat this right. Regardless of whether You have been fully compensa ted or made whole, the Plan may collect from You the proceeds of any full or partial recovery th at You or Your legal representative obtain, whether in the form of a settlement (either before or after any determination of liability) or judgmen t, no matter how those proceeds are captioned or chara cterized. Proceeds from which the Plan may collect include, but are not limited to, economic, non-economic, and punitive damages. No \"collateral source\" rule, any \"Made-Whole Doctrine\" or \"Make-Whole Doctrine,\" claim of unjust enrichment, nor any other equitable limitation will limit our subrogation and reimbursement rights. Benefits paid by the Plan may also be considered t o be benefits advanced. If You receive any payment from any party as a res ult of Illness or Injury, and the Plan alleges some or all of those funds are due and owed to the Plan, You will hold those funds in trust, either in a separate bank account in Your name or in Your att orney's trust account. You agree that You will serve as a trustee over those funds to the extent o f the benefits the Plan has paid. The Plan's rights to recovery will not be reduced due to Your own negligence. Upon our request, You will assign to us all rights of recovery against third parties, to the extent o f the Covered Expenses the Plan has paid for the Illn ess or Injury. The Plan may, at its option, take necessary and ap propriate action to preserve the Plan's rights under these subrogation provisions, including, but not limited to, providing or exchanging medical payment information with an insurer, the insurer's legal representative, or other third party and fili ng suit in Your name, which does not obligate the Plan in any way to pay You part of any recovery the Plan might obtain. You may not accept any settlement that does not fu lly reimburse the Plan, without its written approval. The Plan has the authority and discretion to resol ve all disputes regarding the interpretation of the language stated herein. In the case of Your wrongful death or survival cla im, the provisions of this section apply to Your estate, the personal representative of Your estate, and Your heirs or beneficiaries. 10-01-2011/01-23-2012 -67- 7670-00-411139 No allocation of damages, settlement funds, or any other recovery, by You, Your estate, the personal representative of Your estate, Your heirs, Your beneficiaries, or any other person or party will be valid if it does not reimburse the Pl an for 100% of its interest unless the Plan provides written consent to the allocation. The provisions of this section apply to the parent s, guardian, or other representative of a Dependent Child who incurs an Illness or Injury cau sed by a third party. If a parent or guardian may bring a claim for damages arising out of a mino r's Illness or Injury, the terms of this subrogation and reimbursement clause will apply to that claim. If a third party causes or is alleged to have caus ed You to suffer an Illness or Injury while You are covered under this Plan, the provisions of this sec tion continue to apply, even after You are no longer covered. The Plan and all administrators administering the terms and conditions of the Plan's subrogation and reimbursement rights have such powers and dutie s as are necessary to discharge its duties and functions, including the exercise of its discre tionary authority to (1) construe and enforce the terms of the Plan's subrogation and reimbursement r ights and (2) make determinations with respect to the subrogation amounts and reimbursements owed to the Plan. 10-01-2011/01-23-2012C -68- 7670-00-411139 GENERAL EXCLUSIONS Exclusions, including complications from excluded i tems are not considered covered benefits under this Plan and will not be considered for payment as dete rmined by the Plan.

The Plan provi sions will be applied consistently with respect to similarly situated individuals. Pre-Determination A Pre-Determination is a determination of benefits by the Claims Administrator, on behalf of the Plan, prior to services being provided. Although not req uired by the Plan, a Covered Person or provider may voluntarily request a Pre-Determination. A Pre-Det ermination informs individuals whether, and under which circumstances, a procedure or service is gene rally a covered benefit under the Plan. Covered Persons or providers may wish to request a Pre-Dete rmination before Incurring medical expenses. A Pre-Determination is not a claim and therefore cann ot be appealed. A Pre-Determination that a procedure or service may be covered under the Plan does not guarantee the Plan will ultimately pay the claim. All Plan terms and conditions will still be applied when determining whether a claim is payabl e under the Plan. TYPE OF CLAIMS AND DEFINITIONS Pre-Service Claim needing prior authorization as re quired by the Plan and stated in this SPD. This is a claim for a benefit where the Covered Per son is required to get approval from the Plan before obtaining the medical care such as in the case of p rior authorization of health care items or service that the Plan requires. If a Cove red Person or provider calls the Plan just to find out if a claim will be covered, that is not a Pre-S ervice Claim, unless the Plan and this SPD specifically require the person to call for prior a uthorization (See Pre-Determination above). Giving prior authorization does not guarantee that the Pla n will ultimately pay the claim. Note that this Plan does not require prior authoriz ation for urgent or Emergency care claims, however Covered Persons may be required to notify t he Plan following stabilization. Please refer to the Utilization Management section of this SPD for more details. A condition is considered to be an urgent or Emergency care situation when a sudden an d serious condition such that a Prudent Layperson could expect the patient's life would be jeopardized, the patient would suffer severe pain, or serious impairment of his or her bodily fu nctions would result unless immediate medical care is rendered. Examples of an urgent or Emergen cy care situation may include, but are not limited to: chest pain; hemorrhaging; syncope; fev er equal to or greater than 103\u00b0 F; presence of a foreign body in the throat, eye, or internal cavity ; or a severe allergic reaction. Post-Service Claim means a claim that involves payment for the cost o f health care that has already been provided. Concurrent Care Claim means that an ongoing course of treatment to be pr ovided over a period of time or for a specified number of treatments has been approved by the Plan. PERSONAL REPRESENTATIVE Personal Representative means a person (or provider) who can contact the P lan on the Covered Person's behalf to help with claims, appeals or oth er benefit issues. Minor Dependents must have the signature of a parent or Legal Guardian in order to appoint a third party as a Personal Representative . If a Covered Person chooses to use a Personal Repre sentative, the Covered Person must submit a written letter to the Plan stating the following: The name of the Personal Representative, the date a nd duration of the appointment and any other pertinent information. In addition, the Covered Person must agree to grant their Personal Representative access to their Protected Health Information. This lette r must be signed by the Covered Person to be consider ed official. 10-01-2011/01-23-2012 -75- 7670-00-411139 PROCEDURES FOR SUBMITTING CLAIMS Most providers will accept assignment and coordinat e payment directly with the Plan on the Covered Person's behalf. If the provider will not accept a ssignment or coordinate payment directly with the P lan, then the Covered Person will need to send the claim to the Plan within the timelines discussed below i n order to receive reimbursement. The address for su bmitting medical claims is on the back of the group health identification card. Covered Persons who receive services in a country o ther than the United States are responsible for ensuring the provider is paid. If the provider wil l not coordinate payment directly with the Plan, th e Covered Person will need to pay the claim up front and then submit the claim to the Plan for reimbursement. The Plan will reimburse Covered Per sons for any covered amount in U.S. currency. The reimbursed amount will be based on the U.S. equival ency rate that is in effect on the date the Covered Person paid the claim, or on the date of service if paid date is not known. A complete claim must be submitted in writing and s hould include the following information: Covered Person/patient ID number, name, sex, date of birth, Social Security number, address, and relationship to Employee Authorized signature from the Covered Person Diagnosis Date of service Place of service Procedures, services or supplies (narrative descri ption) Charges for each listed service Number of days or units Patient account number (if applicable) Total billed charges Provider billing name, address, telephone number Provider Taxpayer Identification Number (TIN) Signature of provider Billing provider Any information on other insurance (if applicable) Whether the patient's condition is related to empl oyment, auto accident, or other accident (if applicable) Assignment of benefits (if applicable) TIMELY FILING Covered Persons are responsible for ensuring that c omplete claims are submitted to the Third Party Administrator as soon as possible after services ar e received, but no later than 12 months from the da te of service. Where Medicare or Medicaid paid as pri mary in error, the timely filing requirement may be increased to three years from the date of service. A Veteran's Administration Hospital has six years from the date of service to submit the claim. A complet e claim means that the Plan has all information tha t is necessary to process the claim. Claims received af ter the timely filing period will not be allowed. INCORRECTLY FILED CLAIMS (Applies to Pre-Service Claims only) If a Covered Person or Personal Representative atte mpts to, but does not properly follow the Plan's procedures for requesting prior authorization, the Plan will notify the person to explain proper proce dures within five calendar days following receipt of a Pr e-Service claim request. The notice will usually b e oral, unless written notice is requested by the Covered P erson or Personal Representative. 10-01-2011/01-23-2012 -76- 7670-00-411139 HOW HEALTH BENEFITS ARE CALCULATED When UMR receives a claim for services that have be en provided to a Covered Person, it will determine if the service is a covered benefit under this group h ealth Plan. If it is not a covered benefit, the cl aim will be denied and the Covered Person will be responsibl e for paying the provider for these costs. If it i s a covered benefit, UMR will establish the allowable p ayment amount for that service, in accordance with the provisions of this SPD. Claims for covered benefits are paid according to a n established fee schedule, a Negotiated Rate for certain services, or as a percentage of the Usual a nd Customary fees. Fee Schedule : Generally, providers are paid the lesser of the billed amount or the maximum fee schedule for the particular covered service, minus any Deductible, Plan Participation rate, Co-pay or penalties that the Covered Person is responsible fo r paying. Where a network contract is in place, th e network contract determines the Plan's allowable ch arge used in the calculation of the payable benefit . Negotiated Rate : On occasion, UMR will negotiate a payment rate w ith a provider for a particular covered service such as transplant services, Durabl e Medical Equipment, Extended Care Facility treatment or other services. The Negotiated Rate i s what the Plan will pay to the provider, minus any Co- pay, Deductible, Plan Participation rate or penalti es that the Covered Person is responsible for payin g. Where a network contract is in place, the network c ontract determines the Plan's Negotiated Rate. Usual And Customary (U&C) is the amount that is usually charged by health ca re providers in the same geographical area (or greater area, if necessary) f or the same services, treatment or materials. An industry fee file is used to determine U&C fee allo wances. The U&C level is at the 85 th percentile, see surgery and assistant surgeon under the Covered Ben efits for exceptions related to multiple procedures . As it relates to charges made by a network provider , the term Usual and Customary means the Negotiated Rate as contractually agreed to by the p rovider and network (see above). A global package includes the services that are a necessary part of a procedure. For individual services that are part of a global package, it is customary for the individual services not to be billed separately. A separate c harge will not be allowed under the Plan. NOTIFICATION OF BENEFIT DETERMINATION If a claim is submitted by a Covered Person or a pr ovider on behalf of a Covered Person and the Plan does not completely cover the charges, the Covered Person will receive an Explanation of Benefits (EOB ) form that will explain how much the Plan paid towar d the claim, and how much of the claim is the Cover ed Person's responsibility due to cost-sharing obligat ions, non-covered benefits, penalties or other Plan provisions. Please check the information on each E OB form to make sure the services charged were actually received from the provider and that the in formation appears correct. For any questions or concerns about the EOB form, call the Plan at the n umber listed on the EOB or on the back of the group health identification card. The provider will rece ive a similar form on each claim that is submitted. TIMELINES FOR INITIAL BENEFIT DETERMINATION UMR will process claims within the following timeli nes, although the Covered Person may voluntarily extend these timelines: Pre-Service Claim: A decision will be made within 15 calendar days following receipt of a claim request, but the Plan can have an extra 15-day exte nsion, when necessary for reasons beyond the control of the Plan, if written notice is given to the Covered Person within the original 15-day perio d. Post-Service Claims: Claims will be processed wit hin 30 calendar days, but the Plan can have an additional 15-day extension, when necessary for rea sons beyond the control of the Plan, if written notice is provided to the Covered Person within the original 30-day period. Concurrent Care Claims: If the Plan is reducing o r terminating benefits before the end of the previously approved course of treatment, the Plan w ill notify the Covered Person prior to the coverage for the treatment ending or being reduced. 10-01-2011/01-23-2012 -77- 7670-00-411139 Effective: 10-01-2012 Emergency and/or Urgent Care Claim: The Plan will notify a Covered Person or provider of a benefit determination (whether adverse or not) with respect to a claim involving Emergency or Urgent Care as soon as possible, taking into accoun t the medical necessity, but not later than 72 hours after the receipt of the claim by the Plan. A claim is considered to be filed when the claim fo r benefits has been submitted to UMR for formal consideration under the terms of this Plan. CIRCUMSTANCES CAUSING LOSS OR DENIAL OF PLAN BENEFI TS Claims can be denied for any of the following reaso ns: Termination of Your employment. Covered Person is no longer eligible for coverage under the health Plan. Charges Incurred prior to the Covered Person's Eff ective Date or following termination of coverage. Covered Person reached the Maximum Benefit under t his Plan. Amendment of group health Plan. Termination of the group health Plan. Employee, Dependent or provider did not respond to a request for additional information needed to process the claim or appeal. Application of Coordination of Benefits. Enforcement of subrogation. Services are not a covered benefit under this Plan . Services are not considered Medically Necessary. Failure to comply with prior authorization require ments before receiving services. Misuse of the Plan identification card or other fr aud. Failure to pay premiums if required. Employee or Dependent is responsible for charges d ue to Deductible, Plan Participation obligations or penalties. Application of the Usual and Customary fee limits, fee schedule or Negotiated Rates. Incomplete or inaccurate claim submission. Application of utilization review. Experimental or Investigational procedure. Other reasons as stated elsewhere in this SPD. ADVERSE BENEFIT DETERMINATION (DENIED CLAIMS) Adverse Benefit Determination means a denial, reduction or termination of a bene fit, or a failure to provide or make payment, in whole or in part, for a benefit. It also includes any such denial, reduct ion, termination or failure to provide or make payment t hat is based on a determination that the Covered Person is no longer eligible to participate in the Plan. If a claim is being denied in whole or in part, and the Covered Person will owe any amount to the provider, the Covered Person will receive an initia l claim denial notice, usually referred to as an Explanation of Benefits (EOB) form, within the time lines described above. The EOB form will: Explain the specific reasons for the denial. Provide a specific reference to pertinent Plan pro visions on which the denial was based. Provide a description of any material or informati on that is necessary for the Covered Person to perfect the claim, along with an explanation of why such material or information is necessary, if applicable. Provide appropriate information as to the steps th e Covered Person can take to submit the claim for appeal (review). If an internal rule or guideline was relied upon, or if the denial was based on Medical Necessity or Experimental treatment, the Plan will notify the Co vered Person of that fact. The Covered Person has the right to request a copy of the rule/guideli ne or clinical criteria that was relied upon, and s uch information will be provided free of charge. 10-01-2011/01-23-2012 -78- 7670-00-411139 APPEALS PROCEDURE FOR ADVERSE BENEFIT DETERMINATION S If a Covered Person disagrees with the denial of a claim or a rescission of coverage determination, th e Covered Person or his/her Personal Representative c an request that the Plan review its initial determination by submitting a written request to th e Plan as described below. An appeal filed by a provider on the Covered Person's behalf is not cons idered an appeal under the Plan unless the provider is a Personal Representative. First Level of Appeal : This is a mandatory appeal level. The Covered Person must exhaust the following internal procedures before any outside ac tion is taken. Covered Persons must file the appeal within 180 da ys of the date they received the EOB form from the Plan showing that the claim was denied. The Pl an will assume that Covered Persons received the EOB form five days after the Plan mailed the EO B form. Covered Persons or their Personal Representative w ill be allowed reasonable access to review or copy pertinent documents, at no charge. Covered Persons may submit written comments, docum ents, records and other information relating to the claim to explain why they believe the denial should be overturned. This information should be submitted at the same time the written request f or a review is submitted. Covered Persons have the right to submit evidence that their claim is due to the existence of a physical or mental medical condition or domestic vi olence, under applicable federal nondiscrimination rules. The review will take into account all comments, do cuments, records and other information submitted that relates to the claim. This would in clude comments, documents, records and other information that either were not submitted previous ly or were not considered in the initial benefit decision. The review will be conducted by individu als who were not involved in the original denial decision and are not under the supervision of the p erson who originally denied the claim. If the benefit denial was based in whole or in par t on a medical judgment, the Plan will consult with a health care professional with training and experi ence in the relevant medical field. This health care professional may not have been involved in the original denial decision, nor be supervised by the health care professional who was involved. If the Plan has obtained medical or vocational experts in connection with the claim, they will be identified upon the Covered Person's request, regardless of whether the Plan relies on their advi ce in making any benefit determinations. After the claim has been reviewed, Covered Persons will receive written notification letting them know if the claim is being approved or denied. The notification will provide Covered Persons with the information outlined under the Adverse Benefit Determination section above. It will also notify them of their right to file suit under ERISA after they have completed all mandatory appeal levels described in this SPD. Second Level of Appeal : This is a voluntary appeal level. The Covered Person is not required to follow this internal procedure before taking outsid e legal action. Covered Persons who are not satisfied with the dec ision following the first appeal have the right to appeal the denial a second time. Covered Persons or their Personal Representative m ust submit a written request for a second review within 60 calendar days following the date r eceived the Plan's decision regarding the first appeal. The Plan will assume that Covered Persons received the determination letter regarding the first appeal five days following the date the Plan sends the determination letter. Covered Persons may submit written comments, docum ents, records and other pertinent information to explain why they believe the denial should be overturned. This information should be submitted at the same time the written request for a second review is submitted. Covered Persons have the right to submit evidence that their claim is due to the existence of a physical or mental medical condition or domestic vi olence, under applicable federal nondiscrimination rules. 10-01-2011/01-23-2012 -79- 7670-00-411139 The second review will take into account all comme nts, documents, records and other information submitted that relates to the claim that either wer e not submitted previously or were not considered in the initial benefit decision. The review will b e conducted by individuals who were not involved in the original denial decision or the first appeal, a nd are not under the supervision of those individuals. If the benefit denial was based in whole or in par t on a medical judgment, the Plan will consult with a health care professional with training and experi ence in the relevant medical field. This health care professional may not have been involved in the original denial decision or first appeal, nor be supervised by the health care professional who was involved. If the Plan has obtained medical or vocational experts in connection with the claim, th ey will be identified upon the Covered Person's request, regardless of whether the Plan relies on t heir advice in making any benefit determinations. After the claim has been reviewed, the Covered Per son will receive written notification letting them know if the claim is being approved or denied. The notification will provide the Covered Person with the information outlined under the Adverse Benefit Determination section above. It will also notify them of their right to file suit under ERISA after they have completed all mandatory appeal levels described in this SPD. Regarding the above voluntary appeal level, the Pla n agrees that any statutory limitations that are applicable to pursuing the claim in court will be p ut on hold during the period of this voluntary appe al process. The voluntary appeal process is available only after the Covered Person has followed the mandatory appeal level as required above. This Pla n also agrees that it will not charge the Covered Person a fee for going through the voluntary appeal process, and it will not assert a failure to exhau st administrative remedies if a Covered Person elects to pursue a claim in court before following this voluntary appeal process. A Covered Person's decis ion about whether to submit a benefit dispute through this voluntary appeal level will have no af fect on their rights to any other benefits under th e Plan. For any questions regarding the voluntary level of appeal including applicable rules, a Covered Person 's right to representation (Personal Representative) o r other details, please contact the Plan. Refer to the ERISA Statement of Rights section of this SPD for d etails on a Covered Person's additional rights to challenge the benefit decision under section 502(a) of ERISA.
