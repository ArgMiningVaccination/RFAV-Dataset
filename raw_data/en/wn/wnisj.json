Bacteria coordinate their social behavior in a density depe ndent manner by production of diusible signal molecules by a process known as quorum sensing (QS). I t is generally assumed that in homogenous environments and a t high cell density, QS synchronizes cells in the population to per form collective social tasks in unison which maximize the be net at the inclusive tness of individuals. However, evolutionary the ory predicts that maintaining phenotypic heterogeneity in performing social tasks is advantageous as it can serve as a bet-hedging surviv al strategy. Using Pseudomonas syringae and Xanthomonas camp estris as model organisms, which use two diverse classes of QS signa ls, we have shown that two distinct subpopulations of QS-res ponsive and non-responsive cells exist in the QS-activated populat ion. Our work has also elucidated how ne tuning of QS regulat ory circuits in closely related members of the Xanthomonas group of phytop athogens contribute to their lifestyle change inside the ho st. Overall, these results support the model that bacteria maintain QS-r esponsive and non-responsive subpopulations at high cell d ensities in a bet-hedging strategy to simultaneously perform functions that are both positively and negatively regulated by QS to im prove their tness in fluctuating environments. We are also trying to und erstand how the QS-mediated social structure and individua lity in the bacteria coexists improve their tness in fluctuating env ironments. Dipankar Chatterji, Indian Institute of Bangalore Messengers (p)ppGpp and Cyclic di-GMP mediated regula tion of Cell Divi- sion and Antibiotic Sensitivity in Mycobacterium smegmatis. Quorum Sensing, a cell to cell communication phenomenon, is involved in modulating the social behavior o f bacteria. Nucleotide based second messengers like (p)ppGp p and c-di-GMP are known to regulate such communication in mycoba cteria. (p)ppGpp is synthesized by bacteria to face any kind of stress; while the signalling nucleotide c-di-GMP is synthe sized principally to switch from motile (planktonic) to ses sile (biolm) life style. We investigated the eect of disrupting (p)ppGpp and c-di-GMP signalling on the antibiotic sensitivity in M. sme gmatis. Using Phenotype Microarray (PM) technology, the growth of re l and dcpA knock out strains was compared to those of the wild- type and respective complemented strains in 240 dierent antimi crobials. It was found that the knockout mutants displayed e nhanced10 survival in the presence of multiple antibiotics. The PM dat a was corroborated by the independent determination of mini mum inhibitory concentrations of seven dierent antibiotics. Microscopy analyses revealed that the rel and dcpA strains a re elongated, multinucleate and multiseptate in M. smegmatis. The higher levels of (p)ppGpp and c-di-GMP caused M. Smegmatis assume c occoid morphology. overproduction of (p)ppGpp and c-di-GMP, a chieved through overexpression of Rel and proteins, en cased the overexpression strains relOE and dcpAOE in a biolm like matrix. cited: (1) Gupta et al., cell fate: insights into the biochemica l determinants of cellular decisions cell-to-cell variability. cell-to-cell varia bility caused by non-genetic determinants that often obstacle our capabilities to model biological sy stems accurately. For instance, in the face of an identical s timulus, non- genetic heterogeneity can manifest itself as broad distrib utions in the timing at which individual cells respond to the stimulus or as distinct choices of cell fates (e.g., self-renewal versu s dierentiation or survival versus cell death). These die rences are rooted in the distinct responses that biochemical networks underl ying cellular decisions exhibit. Therefore, I will argue fo r the necessity to complement ensemble measurements (e.g., genomic and pro teomics) with single cell non-invasive techniques thatby p reserving the identity and integrity of cellsenable to establish caus al relationships between biochemical determinants, cellu lar choices, their heterogeneities and context-dependencies. I will illustr ate the most recent work on single cell systems biology of cel lular decisions, including novel methodologies and applications dedicated to the imaging of biochemical network activities and their c ontrol by Optogenetics means. More specically, I will illustrate th e role of biochemical networks in the maintenance of cellula r checkpoints during DNA damage with a perspective on how we may be able, in th e future, to follow complex cellular and biochemical proces ses in living three-dimensional tissue. Our aim is to determine how oncogenes rewire signalling networks (e.g. RAS and RAS-de pendent signal transduction networks) to alteroften in subtle ways cell fate decisions therefore contributing to tumorigenes is. Cell signalling, cell fate choices and the process of transformation exhibit signicant variability within identical clones. Therefor e, we envisage that a single-cell systems biology approach to study signal ling networks underlying cellular transformation will ena ble us to explore cell-to-cell variability in the process of oncogene-induc ed transformation and to investigate the role of non-geneti c heterogeneity during early oncogenesis.11 Glen D'Souza, EAWAG, Zurich, Switzerland.Experimental evolution of metabolic dependency in bacteria. Bacteria frequently lose biosynthetic genes and functions, thus making them dependent on an environmental u ptake of the corresponding metabolite. Despite the ubiquit y of this genome streamlining, it is generally unclear whether the co ncomitant loss of biosynthetic functions is favored by natu ral selection or rather caused by random genetic drift. Here we demonstrate ex perimentally that a loss of metabolic functions is strongly selected for when the corresponding metabolites can be derived from t he environment. Serially propagating replicate populatio ns of the bacterium Escherichia acid-containing envir onments revealed that auxotrophic genotypes rapidly evolv ed in less than 2,000 generations in almost all replicate populations. Mor eover, auxotrophs also evolved in environments lacking ami no acids yet to a much lesser extent. Loss of these biosynthetic function s was due to mutations in both structural and regulatory gene s. In competition experiments performed in the presence of amino acids, auxotrophic mutants gained a signicant tness adva ntage over the evolutionary ancestor, suggesting their emergence was selectively favored. Interestingly, auxotrophic mutants derived amino acids not only via an environmental uptake, but also by cross -feeding from coexisting strains. Our results show that ada ptive tness benets can favor biosynthetic loss-of-function mu tants and the establishment of intricate metabolic in teractions within microbial communities. Yuma Fujimoto, University of Tokyo, Japan.Hierarchical Prisoner's Dilemma in Hierarchical Public-Goods Game. Dilemma in cooperation is one of the major concerns in game theory. In public-goods game, eac h individual pays a cost for cooperation or not for defection , while receives reward from the collected cost in a group. Thus, def ection is benecial for each individual, while cooperation is benecial for the group. Now, groups (say, countries) consisting of ind ividual players also play games. To study such a multi-level game, we introduce a hierarchical public-goods (HPG) game in which tw o groups compete for nite resources, by utilizing costs coll ected from individuals in each group. From analysis of this HPG game, we f ound the hierarchical Prisoners Dilemma, in which groups ch oose defective policy (say armament) as Nash strategy to optimize each groups benet while cooperation optimizes the total be net. On the other hand, for each individual within a group, to refuse cost (say tax) is Nash strategy, which, turns to be cooperatio n policy for group, thus leading to hierarchical dilemma. Here, the rewar d of one group receives increases with the population, as the collected cost does. In spite of it, we nd existence of an optimal group size that maximizes its payo. Furthermore, when the popula tion12 asymmetry between the two groups is large, a smaller group wi ll choose cooperation policy (say disarmament), to avoid ex cessive response from the larger group, which leads to the resolutio n of the Prisoners Dilemma between the groups. HPG model can be applied to, not only animal society, but conflict-cooperati on problem in the multicellularity, that is also discussed. E. Peter Greenberg, University of Washington, Seattle, USA.Communication, cooperation and conflict among cells of the pathog enic bacterium Pseudomonas aeruginosa. Acyl-homoserine lactone quorum sensing circuits allow cell -cell communication in many species of Proteobacteria. There are activates RhlR-I and thus serves as a master QS regulator. Together, th ese circuits activate hundreds of genes, many of which code f or production of secreted or excreted factors. These factors a re considered public goods and can be shared among individua ls in the group. P. aeruginosa requires QS-activated secreted prote ases for growth on casein as the sole carbon and energy source , and over time LasR mutants emerge and invade populations of LasR-int act cooperators. These mutants are social cheaters that rea p the benet of the cooperator-produced proteases without being burdened by the metabolic costs of public goods production. We, and others, have observed that under certain conditions these s ocial cheaters come to an equilibrium with cooperators and d o not cause the population to collapse, as would occur if the number of co operators fell below the quorum threshold. We have probed th e molecular basis of the equilibrium. We hypothesized that co operators can police cheaters by intoxicating them. RhlR ac tivates genes coding for production of several reactive toxic compo unds, including peroxides and hydrogen cyanide. We believe RhlR also induces immunity to these factors. We reasoned that RhlR-ac tivated genes allow P. aeruginosa cooperators to police policing mutants. Polici ng mutants will a capacity to limit invasion by LasR- , RhlR- cheaters and we expect population crashes for failure to ach ieve a quorum. This prediction was borne out by experiments w here LasR-, RhlR- social cheaters rapidly arose to high frequenc ies and caused a population crash. We then showed that polici ng involves cyanideproductionbywildtypeP.aeruginosabyfollowings ocialevolutioninanHcnC-cooperator, HcnC- co operators were overrun by LasR mutants. To test the hypothes is that wildtype P. aeruginosa and LasR- cheaters coexist by virtue of RhlR-activated toxin secretion, and not a direct cell-ce ll interaction, we used dialysis membranes to separate LasR+, coopera tor populations from either LasR+,, RhlR+,or HcnC- cooperat ors. Over 48 hours, the of LasR+, RhlR- cooperators wi th the wildtype were two logs lower than when they were when gr own13 with the HcnC-cooperators. Our studies support the notion th at groups of cooperating P. aeruginosa can police social che aters and we provide a plausible mechanism for this phenomenon. Duncan Greig, Max Planck Institute for Evolutoinary Biolog y, Pl\u00a8 on, Germany. Sexual signalling in yeast. Mating is a well-studied form of cooperation. Prior to matin g, yeast cells court each other by sending and receiving signals in the form of short peptide pheromones. Cells that do not produce pheromone fail to mate . Information about potential mates is conveyed by both the qu antity of a pheromone and its amino acid sequence. Ill talk ab out experiments that manipulate both these factors, showing wh at yeast look for in a mate. Ill talk about theory that explain s the physiological constraints that limit just how sexy a yeast c ell can be. Randal Halfmann, Stowers Institute for Medical Research, Kan sas City, USA. Reciprocal cheating drives epigenetic switching of facultati ve multicellularity. Cooperation between genetically identical cells is the basis of multicellulari ty. Despite an extensive theoretical framework, the molecu lar mechanisms that engender the evolution of cooperation remain enigmati c. We demonstrate that prions and other switch-like mechani sms that regulate yeast cell surfaces suce to create stable divisio ns of labor within genetically homogeneous populations. Th ese switches produce phenotypic granularity, with discrete subpopulat ions diering according to whether or not they express the ad hesin, Flo11. Cells that express Flo11 exhibit a wasteful metabolic strat egy in which tremendous resources are expended on the produc tion of a secreted lubricant that enables them to slide into uncoloni zed territory. Doing so allows them to secure more than their fair share of common resources, albeit at the expense of the more-ecie nt, non-Flo11 expressing cells and therefore to the detrime nt of the population as a whole. Counter to theoretical expectations , we observe that non-Flo11-expressing cells nevertheless persevere, in part because they too are mobilized by the surfactant produced by Flo11-expressing cells. Moreover, they exhibit a conserva tive metabolic strategy that takes advantage of the nutritional niche crea ted in the wake of Flo11-driven colonization. Thus, \"cheati ng\" by one cell type entails the production of a new public good, which is in t urn exploited by the second cell type. Epigenetic switching between the two cell types enables an individual genome and each of th e individual genes that promotes switching to benet from bo th the original and reciprocal forms of cheating, resulting in a population that is relatively resistant to invasion by unr elated individuals.14 William Harcombe, University of Minnesota, St. Paul, USA.Systems biology and eco-evolutionary feedbacks in microbial communities. Conflict and cooperation between bacterial species drive the composition and functi on of microbial communities. Stability of these emergent pr operties will be influenced by the degree to which species interactions are ro bust to genetic perturbations. We use genome-scale metabol ic modeling to computationally analyze the impact of genetic changes wh en Escherichia coli and Salmonella enterica compete, or coo perate. We systematically knocked out in silico each reaction in the me tabolic network of E. coli to construct all 2,583 mutant stoi chiometric models. Then, using a recently developed multi-scale compu tational framework, we simulated the growth of each mutant E . coli in monoculture and in the presence of S. enterica. The type of interaction between the species was set by modulating the in itial metabolites present in the environment. We found that both t he species ratios and community productivity are most robus t to genetic perturbation when the two species cooperate. Additi onally, the number of mutations that have a substantial eec t is lower when the species cooperate than when they are competing. The se results highlight the utility of connecting metabolic me chanisms and studies of ecological stability. Cooperation and confli ct alter the connection between genetic changes and propert ies that emerge at higher levels of biological organization.

Candida species are the most common cause of invasive fungal infections with Candida glabrata accoun ting for up to 30% of total stream infections. C . glabrata is alsothesecondtofourthmostfrequentlyisolatedCandidas peciesfromIntensiveCareUnitpatientsdependingupontheg eographical location. Treatment of C. glabrata infections is particula rly challenging as C. glabrata inherently is less susceptib le to widely used azole antifungals. Our current research is focused on delin eating the strategies that C. glabrata employs to acquire re sistance to antifungals and survive antimicrobial environment of the m ammalian host. Towards our goal, we have screened a mutant li brary, representing 50% of the C. glabrata genome, for altered tne ss in macrophages, and identied a set of 56 genes that is requ ired for survival and/or proliferation of C. glabrata cells in human THP-1 macrophages. These genes are implicated in diverse bio logical processes including chromatin and cell wall organization, signal transduction and Golgi vesicle transport. Molecula r and biochemical characterization of identied factors has revealed that th e communication between C. glabrata and macrophages is mult ifactorial in15 nature. These ndings along with an essential role for the C. glabrata class III phosphoinositide 3-kinase (PI3K) in int eraction with host cells will be presented.

Microenvironmental regulation of intra-tumor heterogenei ty.Heterogeneity within single tumor population referred as intra-tumor heterogeneity has been observed in many experimental studies and has been implicated in develo pment of multi-drug resistance, increased cancer aggressiveness, and metastasis organotropism. Understanding the mechanism (s) that induces this heterogeneity can signicantly improve our understan ding of cancer progression and that knowledge can be used to i dentify novel cancer drugs and therapies. However, due to involvemen t of multiple length/time scale processes and complex cell- cell and cell-surrounding interactions, it is very dicult to study the emergence of intra-population heterogeneity within tu mor population in purely experimental framework. To address this, we are us ing multi-scale computational modeling approach augmente d with experimental studies to understand the emergence of phenot ypical heterogeneity like heterogeneity in cell size/shap e, migration, and, its implication in cancer metastasis. Specically, we are using cellular Potts model (CPM) and cellular automata ( CA)-based in silico study to understand how remodeling of extracellul ar matrix (ECM) - as observed during cancer progression can a lter the tumor population composition. During this meeting, I would like to discuss about some of our recent ndings where we are s tudying how the connement geometry, cell-cell adhesion and cell mi gration can cause the emergence of intra-tumor heterogenei ty. I will also discuss about some of the relevant experimental observatio ns pertaining to populations of HT-1080, MCF7 and MDA-MB-231 c ells.

Maintaining Myeloid Cell Fate and Function During Drosophila H ematopoiesis Through Stress- Sensing Pathways. Drosophilahematopoiesisgivesrisetostem-likemyeloidp rogenitorcellsthatdierentiateintomacrophages or platelet like blood cells. The development of the myeloid system relies on utilizing both systemic and locally derive d signaling cues for maintenance of myeloid precursor cells and their subseq uent dierentiation into mature cells. As we learn more about this system, it is apparent that blood cells rely on utilizing stress-sen sing molecules such as ROS, NO, adenosine and other small meta bolites for development, maintenance and dierentiation into matu re cell types. The cues are generated by progenitor/dieren tiating cells themselves, or are neuronally derived upon sensory or nutri tional stimulation. What is fascinating is that these stres s molecules16 perform developmental roles and are also coopted by the myel oid system to combat stress scenarios such oxidative stress , hypoxia, starvation or infection. The dual regulation by such metabo lites in myeloid development and stress response provides a n interesting paradigm to explore the importance of stress sensing in myel oid development and function. In line with this idea, our lat est ndings elucidate how GABA, a well characterized neurotransmitter fu nctions as a signaling ligand to control myeloid progenitor development and the same molecule is co-opted by blood cells as a metaboli te to overcome immune challenges by parasitic wasps. The tal k will dwell into some of these recent ndings and nally elucidate the importance of odor perception in regulating hematopoie sis via GABA.

As pa rt of the process, a substantial number of cells die (as stalk ), apparently in order to enhance the reproductive tness of the rest (as sp ores). The relative proportions of stalk and spore are appro ximately the same in clonal and genetically heterogeneous groups. As a rs t step towards understanding the principles that underlie t he allocation of cells to the spore and stalk pathways, we have studied two- way and three-way mixes between genetically distinct wild- type strains of various Dictyostelium species. In heterogeneous pairwi se mixes, there is often a bias in the relative contribution o f the two strains to the spore population, and the bias can vary depending on th e proportions in which cells were mixed as amoebae. The exten t of bias decreases markedly when a third strain is present, wh ich adds to the evidence that highly nonlinear interactions lie behind dierentiation into a spore or stalk cell. We suggest that pr e-aggregation cellular quality, and post-aggregation com petition for the ability to complete a life cycle via the spore route, are the m ain factors responsible for multicellular cooperation.

Planarian Schmitdea meditteranea: a regenerative model sy stem to study polarity and tissue organization critical for multicellularity. Planarians are bilateral symmetrical, fresh water platyhe lminths, which emerged as a tractable model system to study regeneration. R egeneration is a complex process, which involves formation of new cells facilitated by stem cells in communication with its ni che followed by remodeling of old and new tissue to form funct ional organ. Planaria in particular is an interesting model becau se of its capacity to regenerate whole body from tiny piece of tissue. The prerequisite for the formation of new tissue at a right place and right size is determined by the ability of the animal to es tablish body axis. In the lab, we study the brain regeneration becaus e of the availability of the markers, easy of conducting func tional assay, distinct spatial organization and presence of vario us cell types (Neural subtypes). Here, I will present the work, which show the critical role of microRNAs in regulating neural speci city, brain organization and neural wiring during planari an brain regeneration. I will also present the preliminary data, whi ch demonstrates the gradient-based regulation of tissue fo rmation and the role of post-transcriptional regulators in establishing t he gradients during planarian regeneration.

Myx- ococcus xanthus is a predatory soil bacterium that exhibits vegetative growth and multicellular fruiting body develop ment as two distinct life history stages. It was previously demonstrat ed that genetically heritable social variation within frui ting bodies is com- mon. However, factors that aect the maintenance of such natu ral within-group variation remain unknown. We tested the e ects of within-group diversity on both total-group and individual -strain spore productivity using eight representative iso lates derived from18 a single natural fruiting body. Interestingly, total produ ctivity of chimeric populations containing all eight isola tes was higher than expected from monoculture controls. Further analyses sugg est that chimerism does not stimulate total productivity by aecting just one or two isolates, but rather a majority of the eight is olates respond positively to chimerism. We also tested for p air-specic interactions by performing all possible pairwise-mixes. I n these experiments, positive responses to mixing were more common than negative ones. Finally, we show that positive eects of mixi ng several isolates on total group productivity are specic to isolate sets that derive from the same fruiting body group, whereas e ects of chimerism on total productivity among isolates fro m dierent fruiting bodies were negative, and increasingly so as a func tion of mean distance between the soil sites from which fruit ing bodies were derived. Our study shows that chimerism among distinct but closely related individuals from the same natural socia l-group can enhance the absolute tness of a majority of group members. T hese studies also show the importance of incorporating info rmation on spatial locations of individuals for analyses of interac tions. Aarthi Ravikrishnan, The Institute of Mathematical Sciences , Chennai, India. Rational development of microbial consortia for metabolic en gineering. Microorganisms are ubiquitous and rarely occur in isolation. They always tend to form commu nities, where they exhibit dierent types of interactions s uch as mutualism, commensalism and predation. A consortium enj oys division of labour and provides a wider scope to leverage the joint metabolic capabilities of the organisms vis--vis a si ngle organism. Although there are several naturally occurri ng microbial communities, their systematic exploitation through ratio nal design and metabolic engineering has rarely been perfor med. Consortia have been chosen randomly in the past for carrying out fermen tations, particularly in wastewater treatments and fermen ted food products, but a framework to design a well-dened consortiu m by exploiting the metabolic diversity is still lacking. Me thods to characterise and dene consortia for industrial applicati ons is still in infancy. To improve our understanding of thes e relationships, it is imperative to focus on the development of systems-leve l modelling oriented towards communities. Towards this end , we have designed an algorithm based on principles from graph theory that can be used for designing industrially useful consorti a. This algorithm predicts the potential metabolic interactions b etween a given set of microorganisms, given the source (s) an d the target (s) ofinterest.

Analysis of strategies for bacterial cooperation. Microbial cooperation is a ubiquitous feature in their exis tence. In these systems, cooperating cells produce and release a co mmon public good to be used by all individuals in the populati on. However, cooperating populations are prone to be taken advan tage of by cheaters (cells who do not invest in production of t he public good, but use the good produced and released by co-operators ). In such a scenario, how does cooperation prevail in nature ? In this talk, I will discuss two strategies (metabolic load sharing and cooperation with spatial structures) that cooperating cells employ to help exist stably in nature. Szabolcs Semsey, University of Copenhagen, Denmark.Birth and life of (p)ppGpp induced persisters. Bacterial persistence is a common phenomenon in isogenic po pu- lations of antibiotic-sensitive bacteria. Persister cell s slow-growing or non-growing cells that are transientl y multidrug tolerant. The bacterial stress alarmone ppGpp plays a central role in t he emergence of persister cells, by activating toxin-antit oxin systems through a regulatory cascade. However, persistence remains a stochastic phenomenon even if this regulatory cascade is i mpaired or if ppGpp synthesis is enhanced. In order to address the sourc e of stochasticity, we have designed a system where intracel lular ppGpp levels and the activity of toxin-antitoxin systems can be fo llowed in single cells using fluorescent reporters. We nd th at persister cells are solitary and maintain a high level of transcriptio n of TA moduls. Our results also suggest that the source of sto chasticity in persister formation originates from a process downstrea m of ppGpp in the regulatory cascade. Wenying Shou, Fred Hutchinson Cancer Research Center, Seattle , USA. Rapid evolution of metabolic dependence. Microbes are often found to have lost their ability to make es sential metabolites (auxotrophs) and instead rely on other individ uals for these metabolites. How might metabolic dependency e volve to be so common? When microbes live inside a host (endosymbionts) , amply host metabolites support auxotrophic endosymbiont s. host transmits only a small number of endosymbionts to its o spring, then auxotrophic endosymbionts can rise to high fre quency simply by chance. On the other hand, auxotrophs have also bee n observed in abundant free-living bacteria found in ocean w ater where nutrient supply is low. How might auxotrophs rise to an a ppreciable frequency in a large population when nutrient su pply is low? We found that nutrient limitation can facilitate the ev olution of certain types of metabolic dependency. Metaboli c interactions can in turn shape spatial organization of microbial communi ties. Rapid evolution of metabolic dependency can contribu te to complex interactions in microbial communities, and help explain th e diculty of culturing microbes in isolation. Varsha Singh, Indian Institute of Science, Bangalore, Indi a. Swarming in Pseudomonas aeruginosa: Why and how? Bacteria have been traditionally regarded as solitary individuals in a planktonic phase. In the past few decades it has increasingly become clear that many cells can come toget her to form multi cellular communities in the face of competition, predation and other unknown factors to ensure survival of th e species. One such multi cellular community is called biolm. This is a surface associated aggregate of mostly sessile cells cover ed in matrix of secreted exopolysaccharides. Swarming population of ba cteria is a quorum dependent community but comprises motile bacteria that show rapid and coordinated movement over semisolid sur faces. Pseudomonas aeruginosa (PA) is a ubiquitous environm ental organism that is also an opportunistic human pathogen in imm une compromised individuals with cystic brosis, and in bur n wounds or diabetic foot ulcers. When solitary, PA can swim, twitch o r slide, but swarms or forms biolm when in a community and has reachedquorum. TheswarmingpatternsofPAcomprisedendri teswhichbranchatregularintervalsremindingoneoffract alpatterns. Since no two species of swarming bacteria produce similar pa tterns, we are motivated to understand if motives and mechan isms of swarming are distinct in these bacteria.

We characterized the sub-populations of the UPEC colony for their other phenotypic traits and the susceptibility towards env ironmental stresses like the eect of antibiotics, chlorin e, heat, etc. The overall bet- hedging strategy of the UPEC population will be d iscussed.

With microbial studies we can see how well theories of social behavior derived from organisms with brains apply to organisms where cell adhesion, receptors, and secretion s prevail. Furthermore, we can test specic predictions of k in selection and mutualism using experiments, experimental evolution, and genomics.

The goal of our research is to clarify the role of bacterial ce ll-cell signaling, called quorum sensing, in shaping the interactions between bacteria and the viruse s that prey on them, bacteriophages. Since bacteriophages r equire a bacterial host in order to multiply, it follows that the abun dance of bacteriophages is tied to the abundance of host cell s. Therefore, we suggest that quorum-sensing signals, which confer infor mation about the types and numbers of bacteria present in a gi ven environ- ment, may also serve as a proxy for information about the pote ntial bacteriophage predation pressure. In support of this hypothesis, we have shown that quorum sensing is involved in regulating b acterial susceptibility to bacteriophages both in the clas sic model system of Escherichia coli K-12 and bacteriophage , and in an environmental isolate of the sh pathogen Vibrio anguillaru m. In the latter case, we demonstrated that Vibrio anguillarum employ s quorum-sensing information to entary antiphage defense strategies.22 Mukund Thattai, National Centre for Biological Sciences, Bang alore, India. Turbocharged evolution in a bacterial arms race. Satoshi Omura made his 2015-Nobel-Prize-winning discovery on golf course: he isolated a soil-dwelling bacterium that s ecreted avermectin, a drug which revolutionised the treatm ent of parasitic diseases. Such stories are surprisingly common: we nd pote nt bioactive compounds in almost any niche that has a rich mic robial ecology. This is because bacteria are engaged in an ongoing a rms race to generate novel molecules, to be deployed as weapo ns against enemies or as signals among friends. Just as our immu ne system uses a combinatorial strategy to generate antibod ies, bacteria could use combinatorial chemistry to synthesise u seful molecules. I will discuss an amazing set of bacterial p roteins called polyketide synthases (PKSs) that actually use such a strate gy. These enzymes produce compounds like the anti-parasiti c avermectin, the antibiotic erythromycin, and the immunosuppressant ra pamycin. We have shown that the unusual structure of PKSs all ows them to convert the random process of DNA recombination into a n ecient strategy to explore chemical space. PKSs thus appe ar optimised not to produce a single chemical product, but rath er to search for new products: they are the innovation engine s that keep bacteria one step ahead of the competition. Catherine Wakeman, Texas Tech University, USA.Factors driving cooperativity versus competition in cystic br osis pathogens. Microorganisms demon- strate numerous types of community behaviors that range fro m cooperative to competitive interactions. Cooperative be haviors include biolm formation in which microorganisms work toge ther to create a barrier that is capable of protecting agains t various environmental insults. However, most microbes also demonst rate competitive behaviors ranging from superior nutrient acquisition capabilities to active killing of competitors. These behav iors are often influenced by environmental nutrient fluctuat ions. The inter- actions between bacterial pathogens surviving within chro nic polymicrobial infections are of particular interest to many researchers in both basic and translational sciences. Pseudomonas aerugi nosa and Staphylococcus aureus are stic pathogens known to occupy sites of polymicrobial infection within the cystic brosis lung. The ability of P. aeruginosa to outcomp ete and kill S. aureus under standard laboratory conditions has been wel l established. However, recent data has shown that in the pres ence of a metal-sequestering innate immune protein, P. aeruginosa does not elaborate its antimicrobial mechanisms and instea d co-exists with S. aureus. I seek to determine the potential benets tha t P. aeruginosa gains from a cooperative lifestyle in the pre sence of S. aureus during infection. Additionally, I have uncovered e vidence that S. aureus can outcompete P. aeruginosa under ce rtain23 conditions. I seek to elucidate the antimicrobial capacity of S. aureus and understand the inherent resistance mechani sms employed by P. aeruginosa under standard laboratory conditions. Marvin Whiteley, The University of Texas at Austin, USA.Biogeography of in vivo microbial biolms. Biogeography is the study of the spatial distribution of spe cies within an ecosystem across space and time. The eld of microb ial ecology has long focused on the micron-scale biogeograp hy and its consequences in polymicrobial communities. For exa mple, studies of the leaf-associated microbiota of plants s how that the arrangement of single cells in structured polymicrobia l communities is responsible for desiccation tolerance, pe rsistence, and resistance to invading species. The biogeography of human- associated polymicrobial communities, including those in disease, has not been studied to similar depth. While it is now widely accepte d that most polymicrobial communities living in natural env ironments, including the human body, form spatially structured consor tia, the mechanisms used by microbes to form these communiti es is not understood. Here I will discuss recent in vivo evidence suppo rting this idea using multiple models of infection, and the d evelopment of a versatile experimental framework for modulating micro bial biogeography on the micron-scale. Gerard Wong, University of California Los Angeles, USAMemory, surface sensing, and behavior adaptation during the rst 20 generations of bacterial life on a surface. Bacterial biolms are integrated communities of cells that adhere to surfaces and are fundamental to the ecology and biology of bacteria. The accommodation of a free -swimming cell to a solid surface is more complex than modula tion of cell adhesion. We investigate the interplay between motili ty appendages, molecular motors, hydrodynamics, and exopo lysaccharide production near the surface environment using state of the a rt tools from dierent elds that are not usually combined, i ncluding theoretical physics, community tracking with single cell r esolution, genetics, and microbiology. Themes such as surf ace sensing, multi-generational signaling via secondary messengers, s ubsequent downstream motility consequences, and the subse quent onset of microcolony organization via interactions between append ages and exopolysaccharides will be discussed.24 Poster Abstracts 1.Understanding Jawaharlal Nehru Universit y, Delhi, India. At population level, the patterns of T cell response for a giv en infection is highly reproducible. But the mechanism at si ngle-cell level for such reproducibility is not clearly known. Single cell l ineage studies showed that naive T cells produce both eecto r and memory T cells. In-vivo lineage tracing experiments [1, 2] demonst rate that expansion of identical CD8+ T Cells show heterogen eity in both clonal family sizes and marker distribution. In short, one s tudy concluding against the asymmetric division as the solo driver and another suggesting a linear developmental path that progre sses from slowly proliferating long-lived to rapidly expan ding short-lived subsets. And the reproducibility of the CD8+ T Cells response is ascribed to the population averaging of the seemingly sto chastic underlying dierentiation fates. However, in vitro experim ental evidence does not overwhelmingly support any single d evelopmental pathway. To explore if other types of models will explain the observations better, I, in this work, developed a branching process model at the cellular level, with variedly inherited and sto chastically distributed factors and then to build a populat ion. The rules of branching process dene the heterogeneous structure of t he population and the properties of inheritance of the facto rs dene the way they are distributed between the cells. Branching proce ss model used in this work is the modied cyton model dened in the context of B Cells expansion [3] with two factors, one for pro pensity to divide (R) and the other for time to die (T), which a re stochastically inherited at each cell division. And the mode l includes three markers which stochastically inherit at ea ch cell division, but have dierent rates of accumulation. Preliminary resul ts suggest that population expanded from this model qualita tively t the experimental results. [1] Gerlach et.al., 2013, Heterogene ous dierentiation patterns Sci ence 340, 635639.

They can either proceed along the lytic pathway, b y increasing their numbers in a burst killing the host cell or play a less aggressive strategy and integrate their genome with the hos t's, ensuring that their numbers increase slowly with each c ell division. Several viruses are discovered in this lysogenic state, and even eukaryotic genomes carry evidence of past integration events with viruses. At the level of microbial communities, the phage-b acteria games are diverse and have multiple players. Multip le phages can target the same bacterial cell and can either co-operate or c ompete. We consider one of the smallest units of such predato r-prey communities i.e. two phages, competing for the same bacteri al host population. We use the classical E.coli, phage syste m to do our study. We show that for such kind of viruses, there exists a pr edictable optimal lysogeny which is the best strategy to pla y when competing with another phage for getting the larger share of the host population to convert to lysogens. 3.Rational development of of Biosciences, Indian Instit ute of Technology Madras, Chennai, India. Microorganisms are ubiquitous and rarely occur in isolatio n. They always tend to form communities, where they exhibit d ierent types of interactions such as mutualism, commensalism and p redation. A consortium enjoys division of labour and provid es a wider scope to leverage the joint metabolic capabilities of the or ganisms vis--vis a single organism. Although there are sever al naturally occurring microbial communities, their systematic exploi tation through rational design and metabolic engineering h as rarely been performed. Consortia have been chosen randomly in the past f or carrying out fermentations, particularly in wastewater treatments and fermented food products, but a framework to design a well -dened consortium by exploiting the metabolic diversity i s still lacking. Methods to characterise and dene consortia for in dustrial applications is still in infancy. To improve our un derstanding of these relationships, it is imperative to focus on the develo pment of systems-level modelling oriented towards communi ties. Towards this end, we have designed an algorithm based on principles f rom graph theory that can be used for designing industrially useful26 consortia. This algorithm predicts the potential metaboli c interactions between a given set of microorganisms, given the source (s) and the target (s) of interest. Results from the algorithm ar e used to rank the combinations to determine the best consort ium. We applied our algorithm to determine the set of microorgani sms that can lead to enhanced bioethanol production while be ing together in a consortium and also predict the metabolic inte ractions that happen between these organisms. Currently, w e are trying to experimentally verify some of the predictions of our algo rithm, by understanding how the microorganisms interact wh ile being together in a consortium. Once established, this algorithm can be used for generating a number of productive consortia f or the production of a wide array of compounds from biofuels to phar maceuticals. This would pave way for systematically analys ing and harnessing the full potential of microbial consortia. 4.Collective motion of Dictyostelium population.Trilochan Bagarti ignaling.

Subho Ghosh and Dipankar Chatterji, Indian Institute of Science, Bangalore, India.Cooperation and conflicts arise when an organism stays in a gr oup and try to make sure that its own genetic material is trans mitted preferentially in a direct or indirect manner compared to th e other members. Like many other biological processes group ing is influenced by transcription factors through the act of trans cription. In eukaryotes zinc nger domain containing trans cription factors are the largest class of transcription factors. In zinc nge r proteins the zinc atom may be coordinated by two cysteine an d two histidine residues, four cysteine residues or three cystei ne and one histidine residues. Among all eubacteria only two g roups of C2H2 zinc nger domain containing proteins have been describ ed structurally as well functionally in alpha proteobacter ia but no27 C4 zinc nger domain containing protein has been reported in details. In Jannaschia sp. a protein containing C- terminal zinc nger domain has been reported structurally but has been ass igned no function. BLAST search using this protein showed the presence of homologues of this protein in Mycobacterium sme gmatis, a saprophytic actinobacterium. This group of prote ins we have named as Mycobacterial Single Zinc Finger Protein (Mszfp). Here we describe the structure-function relationship of Msz fp1. Mszfp1 contains zinc at a molar ratio of 1:1. Mszfp1 is a constitutiv ely expressed predominantly alpha helical DNA binding prote in and can interact with RNA polymerase. On removal of zinc the conforma tion of the protein changes and its DNA binding ability is aec ted. Interacting with RNA polymerase Mszfp1 can increase the amou nt of transcript. We show here that Mszfp1 acts through alpha and sigma A subunit of RNA polymerase. We have also seen that the ov er expression strain of Mszfp1 has an altered colony morphol ogy and sliding motility phenotype compared to wild type strain . Our results show that Mszfp1is a novel zinc nger containin g activator of transcription. Zinc atom is essential for maintaining it s proper structure and function. 6.Coupled public goods games.Amit Vutha and Shashi Thutupalli, NCBS-TIFR, ICTS-TIFR, Bangalore, India.Public-goods dilemmas, and the conditions leading to the ma intenance of cooperation are of great interest in biology. Ho wever, biologically motivated public- goods games need specic va riations. We explore multi-layer games wherein resource pr oduction at a given evel is coupled to goods-sharing at another level. 7.Engineering bacteria for dispersing bacterial biolms.Vihang Ghalsasi and Victor Sourjik, LOEWE Center for Synthetic and Systems Microbiology, Max Pla nck Institute of Terrestrial Microbiology, Marburg, Germany.Biolmsaresurface-associatedstructuresformedbybacte riaembeddedinaself-producedmatrix.

We are interested in the ancient origins of the eukaryotic co mpartmentalized cell plan. Eukaryotes arose from a prokary ote-like ancestor probably during the global oxygenation event 2.5 b illion years ago which evolved into the common ancestor of li ving eukaryotes dated around 1.8 billion-years ago. The shared f eatures of all extant eukaryotes suggest that this last euka ryotic common ancestor (LECA) was already a complex unicellular the absence of any intermediate proto-e ukaryotic forms, the challenge is to understand how LECA arose from a pr okaryote-like ancestor. The endomembrane system of eukary otes consists of membrane bound compartments which exchange mat ter amongst themselves by means of vesicles. To explain thei r origins, the autogenous theory of compartmentalization ha s been proposed (Dacks & Field, 2007). Briefly, it states that organellar diversication is caused by the duplication and divergence of compartment's \"identity-encoding\" genes, an idea which issupported by biophysical models of endomembrane tracking (Ramadas & Thattai, 2013). We have asked which biological scenario wou ld result in concurrent duplication of the entire set of identi ty-encoding genes while providing opportunity for Inter-specieshybridizationtthebill. Ourstudyofonesu chinter-specieshybrid, Saccharomycespastorianus, whos eparentsdiverged apart for 20 million yrs, suggests novelty in endomembrane t racking of the hybrid in terms of gene regulation and ultras tructural complexity. 9.Emergence of heterogeneity in a bacterial population.Sandeep Miryala and Srinandan C. S., Biolm Biology Lab, School of Chemical & Biotechnology, SASTRA University, Thanjavur, India.29 Fluctuating environmental conditions or stochastic gene e xpression could cause emergence of heterogeneity in a bacte rial population. This could also be a bet-hedging strategy of the population. In this study, we observed a pattern of extrapolymeric subst ance (EPS) producing, non- producing and hyper-swarming cell of Uropathogenic E.coli (UPEC) colony on Congo agar (CRA) plat UPEC is the of urinary tract infec tions (UTIs) throughout the world. During infection, persis tent, biolm forming and antibiotic resistant sub-populations emerges and these could be phenotypic or genotypic in nature. We char acterized the sub-populations of the UPEC colony for their other phenot ypic traits and the susceptibility towards environmental s tresses like the eect of antibiotics, chlorine, heat, etc. The overall b et- hedging strategy of the UPEC population will be discussed . 10.Evolution of for Biological Sciences, Bangalore, Karnatak a, India. Microbial habitats are frequently redened due to uncontro lled environmental factors as well as microbial activity wh ich impose selection pressures on evolution of molecular processes. T he interaction between the molecular processes and ecologi cal niche to generate a phenotype is poorly understood. The advent of hig h throughput technology such as sequencing of entire genome s, system level measurement of gene-expression has oered an opportu nity to understand the lifestyle of an organism in its natura l ecological context. Starvation is a prevalent state of microorganisms in their natural niche due to intense competition for resour ces. Starving cultures of Escherichia coli presents a model system to unde rstand the forces of selection operating on organism to opti mize their nutrient requirements. E. coli cultured in Luria Bertini (L B), a complex medium which has very low amount of glucose but p lenty of other oligosaccharides, smaller peptides and amino acid s supports a brief exponential-phase. Extending stationar y-phase results in major population crash, however a minority survives for s ubstantially prolonged periods without further supplemen tation of fresh nutrients. Thesurvivingpopulationbecomesthesourceofg eneticdiversityfromwhichmutantswithincreasedtnesst hantheparent are selected and proliferate under non-growth conditions. This phenomenon is known as Growth Advantage in Stationary Ph ase (GASP) and the mutants are referred as GASP mutants. We have use d E.coli GASP model of stationary-phase sigma factor rpoS was evolved for 28 day s under prolonged starvation in lysogeny broth batch cultur es. rpoS819 has a 46 base-pair duplication at C-terminal end resulting i n functional attenuation. Two colony morphology variants w ere identied30 by regular phenotypic screening of independently evolving populations: 1) A colony morphology variant that is charact erised as irregular shape with undulate margins. 2) A colony size vari ant, characterized by small colonies, was rst observed at t he start of the third week of experiment in two independent population and w as coexisting with the regular sized colonies. Genome seque ncing of two independent small colony variants has revealed a mutati on in rpoC gene. Experiments for genotype to phenotype mappi ng and ecological relationship underlying the coexistence of col ony size variants are in progress. Spectrum of mutations ide ntied by periodic population genome sequencing provided two key observation s: 1) The original 46 base pair duplication in rpoS819 allele reduplicated resulting in a second allele 92 all the replicates. The rpoS819 and rpoS819 92 allele frequencies suggest a competition between them. 2) Multiple alleles of the gene cpdA appeared i n four out of the ve replicates with a rise in frequency there after. CpdA is a cAMP phosphodiesterase that breaks down cAMP. Intere stingly, isolated cpdA variants are present in the rpoS819 92 background. Further experiments are in progress to deciphe r the epistatic relation between these mutations. Strong pa rallelism at rpoS and cpdA supports previously established observation of RpoS and cAMP role under carbon and energy limitation. The c urrent study will help to narrow the gap in our understanding of how t hese two players interact to coordinate adaptation to a comp lex environment such as prolonged stationary-phase. 11.Dynamics of bacterial communities associated with developmenta l stages of butterflies and their impact on butterfly tness.Kruttika Phalnikar , Krushnamegh Kunte and Deepa Agashe, National Centre for Biological Sciences, Bangalore, India.Bacterial communities associated with insects are known to influence host physiology, dietary niche, immune system, an d reproduc- tion. They exist either in the extracellular environment, s uch as bacteria associated with gut lining or as intracellul ar symbionts e.g. in ovaries. These bacterial species communicate, comp ete and cooperate not only within themselves but also intera ct with the cells of the host insect. Depending on the nature of the inter action between bacteria and host (benecial, deleterious o r neutral), mutualistic or antagonistic associations may arise and evo lve between the two. One of the major questions in the eld is h ow these associations influence the assemblage of bacterial communi ties in insects. Our study focuses on the bacterial communit ies associated with butterflies. During development, butterflies undergo c omplete metamorphosis and have four distinct stages egg, la rva, pupa and adult. We focus especially on the larval to adult transit ion in butterflies, which is associated with a drastic dietar y switch as well31 as tremendous physiological change and massive tissue rear rangement including gut tissue, which is a major reservoir o f bacterial cells. This transition in diet and physiology in butterflies might alter the nature of host-bacterial association over t he course of development. For instance, a bacterial species that is bene cial in the larval stage may not be advantageous for the adul t, resulting in distinct bacterial communities across metamorphosis. T o test this hypothesis, we analyzed bacterial communities o f 8 dierent butterfly species across developmental stages. In addition , we carried out manipulative experiments to understand the eect of gut bacteria on tness of 2 butterfly species and here we present t he results for the same. 12.Hierarchical Prisoner's Dilemma in Hierarchical Takahiro(2) and Kaneko Kunihiko(1), (1) Department of Basic Science and (2) Department of Applied Physics at The University of Tokyo, Japan. Dilemma in cooperation is one of the major concerns in game th eory. In public-goods game, each individual pays a cost for c ooper- ation or not for defection, while receives reward from the co llected cost in a group. Thus, defection is benecial for eac h individual, while cooperation is benecial for the group. Now, groups (sa y, countries) consisting of individual players also play ga mes. To study such a multi-level game, we introduce a hierarchical public -goods (HPG) game in which two groups compete for nite resourc es, by utilizing costs collected from individuals in each group . From analysis of this HPG game, we found the hierarchical Pri soners Dilemma, in which groups choose defective policy (say armam ent) as Nash strategy to optimize each groups benet while coo peration optimizes the total benet. On the other hand, for each indiv idual within a group, to refuse cost (say tax) is Nash strategy , which, turns to be cooperation policy for group, thus leading to hie rarchical dilemma. Here, the reward of one group receives inc reases with the population, as the collected cost does. In spite of i t, we nd existence of an optimal group size that maximizes it s payo. Furthermore, when the population asymmetry between the two groups is large, a smaller group will choose cooperation pol icy (say disarmament), to avoid excessive response from the larger g roup, which leads to the resolution of the Prisoners Dilemma between the groups. HPG model can be applied to, not only animal societ y, but conflict-cooperation problem in the multicellularit y, that is also discussed.32 13.Functional characterization Institute of Bombay, Mumbai, India.Cellular dierentiation in response to nutritional deplet ion is well studied in Saccharomyces cerevisiae and Dictyos telium discoideum. In S. cerevisiae, depletion of carbon and/or nitrogen induc es lamentaion or transition to stationary phase (G0) or spo rulation. In D. discoideum, depletion of food source induces unicellula r to multicellular transition. A common element that has bee n shown to participate in the above processes is ammonium transporter . S. cerevisiae strain lacking ammonium transporter coded b y MEP2 is defective in pseudohyphal dierentiation. Even though, th e deletion of amtA, the ortholgue of MEP2, in D. discoideum sho ws severe defect in dierentiation process, the underlying mechanis m is not known. Phylogenetic analysis suggests that, of the a mmonium transportersofS.cerevisiaeandD.discoideum, AmtAandMep 2belongtothesamefamilyofammoniumtransporters. Theobj ective of the study is to functionally characterize amtA by using S. cerevisae as a surrogate system. amtA when present in multip le copies complements mep2 deletion in S. cerevisiae for growth on low ammonia. This complementation is observed when amtA is expr essed in multiple copies. Surprisingly, when expressed in single copy amtA fails to complement, suggesting that amtA is not as active as MEP2. Therefore, mutants of amtA that could complement mep2 deletion, when expressed in single copy, were isolated to de cipher the mechanism of ammonium transport by AmtA. Further analysis is being carried out to characterize the mutants. 14.Cooperation, survival and resilience: ecological consequences (1), Alfonso Perez-Escudero(2), Aming Li(2), Je Gore(2) (1) Indian Institute of Science, Bangalore; (2) MIT Physics of Living Systems, Northeastern University. While negative frequency dependent selection and populati on structure are prominently used to explain the evolution o f cooperation separately, they have rarely been studied together. Here, we explore the eect of metapopulation structure in a yeast exp erimental system with cooperators (which produce a public good) and de fectors (which don't). Specically, we focus on the eect of hetero- geneouos metapopulation structure, where not all nodes are equivalent and migration between nodes is asymmetric. We n d that a star network enhances the fraction of cooperators nearly 2 -fold compared to isolated nodes and complete networks, und er some33 parameter regimes. This increase in cooperation is due to a l ower density in the side nodes of the network, causednby the a symmetric migration rate. This low density on the side nodes makes star networks less capable of surviving in challenging environm ents than isolated populations: isolated populations can survive hi gh levels of sustained mortality that are lethal for the star network. Despite this, we nd that a star network has greater resilience to tem porary perturbations (a salt shock) than isolated populati ons. These two apparently opposed results can be reconciled: the level of permanent harshness that the network can withstand is giv en by the side nodes which are the most vulnerable parts of the network . In contrast, the threshold for surviving a temporary pertu rbation is given by the central node (which has a higher population de nsity and a higher cooperator fraction than isolated nodes) , because it can reseed the side nodes and rescue the whole network. Our results experimentally conrm that heterogeneous network s favor cooperation and demonstrate that ecological communities r espond very dierently to constantly and transiently harsh environments. 15.The balance between pro-growth and pro-arrest signals deter mine the homeostatic control of checkpoint signalling and cell fate.Siddharth De , Alessandro Esposito and Ashok R. Venkitaraman, MRC Cancer Unit, University of Cambridge, UK.Cellular homeostasis relies upon cell-cycle checkpoints, which, at the single-cell exhibit stochasticity and n on-genetic hetero- geneity. The G2 checkpoint monitors DNA damage and prevents i t from being carried over into mitosis, but the mechanisms th at regulate its enforcement in dividing cells are not well unde rstood. We have combined single-cell imaging with dynamic fl uorescence microscopy to investigate this problem. Here, we report that DNA damage triggers an intersection between the ERK signalli ng pathway and the p53 transcription factor, which regulates c ell fate after G2 checkpoint activation. DNA damage activate s dy- namic changes in the ERK and p53 pathways that exhibit in-pha se kinetics. ERK activity alters p53 dynamics but not vice ve rsa. Single-cell imaging reveals that ERK modulation aects cel l fate decisions after G2 checkpoint activation. Collectiv ely, our ndings reveal cross-talk between growth factor-driven oncogenic pathways, the DNA damage response, and p53, with implication s for early oncogenesis, tumour promotion and maintenance of cellular homeostasis34 Sciences, Chennai, India.Motile micro-organisms respond to a variety of chemical and physical stimuli, including chemical concentrations, pH c hanges, oxygen, osmolarity and even magnetic elds. Cyanobacteria or 'blue-green alge', are a widely distributed, diverse gro up of oxygenic photosynthetic gram-negative bacteria that have shown to e xhibit phototaxis - motion in response to a light stimulus. I n the model cyanobacterium Synechocystis sp. PCC 6803, robust positiv e phototaxis has been observed as dense nger like projectio ns (over 1-3 days) of cells emerging from a compact colony that are seen to move toward the direction of white light. Other wavelengths of light elicit responses that range from slower moving colony front s (red light and far-red) to negative phototaxis (blue, UV and high light conditions). While cells are individually able to sense and respond to light direction, it has been shown that there is li kely a social aspect to this phototaxis, since cells form dense aggregate s before forming nger like projections. This is believed to be mediated through Type 4 Pili (T4P), that allow cells to attach to other cells. Cell motion is also enhanced in the presence of slime, which the cells produce to facilitate motion across surfaces. Here we p resent an agent based model for cyanobacterial phototaxis w here agents can sense the direction of light and move towards it. To model the T4P we allow agents to attach to and exert forces on other a gents in their neighborhood. The individual agents also change th e properties of the region they occupy by laying down 'slime' . Thus, agents move as a function of the sensed direction of light, th e forces exerted on them by neighboring agents and the 'slime ' present at their current location. We show that through this model, w e can simulate a variety of phenotypes of collective photota xis. The model also predicts the nature of collective response in cya nobacterial phototaxis when the direction of the light is ab ruptly changed and when non-trivial patterns of input light are presented t o the colony. 17.Evolution on Fitness Landscapes.Dibyendu Dutta and Supreet Saini, Department of Chemical Engineering, Indian Institute of Tec hnology Bombay, Mumbai, India. Assuming a constant environment and a particular selection p ressure, it may be possible to represent the dierent genoty pes an organism may evolve into, as a tness landscape. The path to t he mutant genotype from the original may involve an increase or decrease in tness. In Darwinian Evolution only tter organ isms get selected and xed in the population. However, each mu tation35 does not bring forth an additive eect, sometimes the combin ed eect can be unexpectedly higher, or lower, or neutral, wh ich may be due to epistasis, and molecular pleiotropy. This present s the situation where an organism needs to rst acquire mutat ions that are not the highest in tness, in order to attain the peak tne ss on the landscape. Experiments show that organisms indeed are able to take complicated mutation trajectories to acquire t he tness peaks, for example evolving resistance to a new ant ibiotic. So, does the optimal trajectory simply emerge by trial and error or do cells possess some sort of compass to help them decide ea ch step? We aim to simulate evolution on dierent types of tness land scapes and identify important metrics that allow for naviga tion on a rugged tness landscape, and thus reproduce evolution. 18.Experimental evolution of metabolic dependency in bacteria.Glen D'Souza and Christian Kost Max Planck Institute for Universi Osnabrueck, Germany; biosynthetic genes and functions , thus making them dependent on an environmental uptake of th e cor- responding metabolite. Despite the ubiquity of this genome streamlining, it is generally unclear whether the concomit ant loss of biosynthetic functions is favored by natural selection or r ather caused by random genetic drift. Here we demonstrate exp erimentally that a loss of metabolic functions is strongly selected for w hen the corresponding metabolites can be derived from the en vironment. Serially propagating replicate populations of the bacteri um Escherichia coli in amino acid-containing environments revealed that auxotrophic genotypes rapidly evolved in less than 2,000 ge nerations in almost all replicate populations. Moreover, a uxotrophs also evolved in environments lacking amino acids yet to a much les ser extent. Loss of these biosynthetic functions was due to m utations in both structural and regulatory genes. In competition exp eriments performed in the presence of amino acids, auxotrop hic mutants gained a signicant tness advantage over the evolutionary ancestor, suggesting their emergence was selectively favo red. Interest- ingly, auxotrophic mutants derived amino acids not only via an environmental uptake, but also by cross-feeding from coe xisting strains. Our results show that adaptive tness benets can f avor biosynthetic loss-of-function mutants and interactions within microbial comm unities.36 (1) and Paul Rainey(1,2), (1) NZIAS, Massey University, Auckland; (2) Max Planck Institut e for Evolutionary Biology, Pl\u00a8 on, Germany. Evolution of cooperation is hypothesized to be the very rst step in the evolution of multicellularity and so the underst anding of it becomes important; however, it presents a problem; nat ural selection rewards selsh behavior; yet, in nature, coo peration is apparently common. Assortment between cooperating types ha s been identied as the underlying mechanism behind theorie s for the evolution of cooperation. However, the theories fail to a cknowledge frequency (evolutionary) and density (ecologi cal) dependent nature of interactions, capable of generating co-evolutio nary interactions. In this regard the feedback between ecol ogy and evolution (eco-evo feedback) is of likely importance. In a previous lo ng-term evolutionary experiment, a rudimentary life cycle was established in model bacterial populations between a cellulose produci ng, group living cooperator type, termed WS, and a solitary, free living cheater type, termed SM. I believe that the eco-evo feedback is likely to have occurred on the WS-SM interactions. The aim of my study was to identify the presence of the feedback in the evol ved lineages. I compared the evolutionary dynamics and popu lation dynamics on the interactions between WS and SM. I also report the joint influence of evolutionary and population dynamic p atterns via ecospace diagrams of the ancestor and evolved lineages. The results showed that the interactions between WS and SM ar e both frequency and density dependent and the interplay of the two factors suggest the presence of the eco-evo feedback. 20.Novel microfluidic platform to control and investigate cell comm unity behaviour using portable microscopy.Rudra Vaswata Roy Choudhury (1), Dr. Sunil Laxman(2), Dr. Anil Indian Institute of Technology Madras; (2) inStem, NCBS-TI FR Bangalore. Varied nutrient stimuli might lead to varied cell responses , thereby aecting the behaviour of cell communities. We des ign and demonstrate a novel Lab-on-chip platform which provides a c onvenient technology to examine the dierent cellular resp onses to varied nutrient conditions. The platform consists of a micr ofluidic device, which can control nutrient gradient in mult iple chambers, where colonies of cells are maintained. It could be used to st udy single cell as well as cell community responses to diere nt nutrients and micro-environmental conditions. The device is augment ed to a portable microscopy platform which enables imaging o f live cells, and thus provides a mean to study growth behaviour of c ell colonies in eect to key nutrient conditions. The micros cope37 consists of cost-eective and easily available optical and electronic components and thus provides a platform for anal yzing micro cell communities (including small microbial or mammalian cell c olonies) under diverse, controlled environmental conditi ons. 21.Interplay of synergy and redundancy in a transmission motif. of Chemistry, Bose Institute, Kolkata, India.To better respond to the physio-chemical changes in its envi ronment, it is important for a living system to harness usefu l information and process it with signicant accuracy. For this purpose, l iving species have developed optimized architechtural com plexity over the evolutionary timescale thereby attaining better adapt ation skills. Information theory provides sophisticated t echniques to address this problem eciently and identies the governing physical principles. We have utilized a stochastic framewo rk to describe the dynamics of dierent interacting biochemical species f orming a two-step cascade (TSC) motif. Application of Linear Noise Approximation to the set of Langevin equations involving Gau ssian random variables which represent involved biochemic al species, provides analytical expressions for the second moments whi ch are ingredients for calculating mutual information (MI) . The formalism of Partial Information Decomposition using these MI terms q uanties the net synergy which predicts whether the source v ariables are capable of synergistically provide information about the t arget variable or not. The analysis reveales signatures of b oth synergy and redundancy, the later arising out of Markovian property. Ano ther important nding of this study is that redundancy in inf ormation transmission can indeed empower delity of the signaling pa thway.

While th ey remain good systems to study cooperation and competition in popula tions, we believe that there is a lack of simple phenomenolog ical models38 that explain some overarching themes in the eld. We believe these to be of three broad kinds: stability, eciency and rep roducibility (parallelism) among similar communities. Here, we construc ted a class of simple abstract models of microbial communiti es with trophic layers. We believe such models capture temporal tre nds about the stability and eciency of certain classes of co mmunities (such as those used in wastewater treatment) that are often s een to undergo rapid turnovers and succession, as well as to t alk about rarefaction studies where areas are sampled for new species . 23.Metabolic Regulation of Fungal Morphogenesis.Sriram Varahan and Sunil Laxman, Institute for Stem Cell Biology and Regenerative Medicine, B angalore, India. Unicellular organisms employ multiple strategies to adapt t o changing environments around them. Once such strategy dep loyed unicellular organisms is the ability to form complex multic ellular communities. During this transition from a unicell ular form to a multicellular community which is often reversible, cells usually undergo division of labor wherein dierent cells of the commu- nity perform distinct specialized functions. This process of Cellular specialization is critical for the survival of t hese multicellular complex communities. Fungal morphogenesis is one such proc ess wherein fungal cells can reversibly switch from a sessil e unicel- lular state to numerous types of facultative multicellular forms including biolms (liquid medium), rugose mats (soli d medium) hyphal/pseudohyphae, flocculation etc. to name a few. These morphogenetic changes allows the fungi to quickly adapt to v arying environmental conditions and even thrive in them. For examp le, Candida albicans, an opportunistic pathogen that cause s a variety of human infections can reversibly switch between its yeast like form (non-pathogenic) and its hyphal form (pathogenic ) when it enters into a vertebrate host. Several studies have shown th at this morphogenesis is crucial for C. albicans to cause suc cessful infections in a host. Candida glabrata has recently emerged as the second leading cause of infective candidiasis and for ms robust biolms on both biotic as well as abiotic surfaces to cause pe rsistent infections. Pathogenic isolates of C. glabrata fo rms rugose mats on solid surfaces compared to the smooth colonies formed by t he non-pathogenic isolates. Although many genes involved in these morphogenetic behaviors are known, we lack an understandin g of the driving principles behind such behavior. We hypothe size that specic metabolic demands of these aforementioned fungal p athogens in a particular host niche are primary determinant s of fungal morphogenesis, with key metabolic events determining the a bility to switch to complex communities. Saccharomyces cer evisiae can serve as an excellent model for understanding these metabol ic regulations of fungal morphogenesis as it can reversibly switch from39 a single-cell form to multiple distinct types of complex com munities under specic nutrient conditions. These complex communities formed by S. cerevisiae show spatial organization, morphol ogical dierences, and can survive harsh environmental con ditions. Such features in S. cerevisiae includes flocculation, biolm for mation, and invasive or pseudohyphal growth of cells. We the refore propose to address this hypothesis by using biolms with rugose morp hology (BRM) mor- phogenesis. Our initial ndings show that S. cerevisiae can form robust BRMs when grown at low glucose conditions, in con trast to the uniform, smooth colonies they form when glucose is abund ant. We also have discovered gluconeogenesis to be a critica l process for this morphogenetic change since the deletion of the gene encoding a key gluconeogenic We also observe that the availability of free amino acids are cr itical for the formation of biolms with rugose morphology. 24.With a little help from my favo ur the evolution of metabolic cross-feeding?Samir Giri and Christian Kost, Experimental Ecology and Evolution research group, Max Pla nck Institute for Chemical Ecology, Jena, Ger- many.Metabolic cross-feeding interactions, in which two or more bacterial species exchange costly metabolites, are very co mmon in bacte- rial communities. Evolutionary theory predicts cooperati should favour genealogically related individ uals over non-kin. Whether or not the relatedness among two bacterial lineages to engage in cooperative cross-feeding interactions remai ns elusive. Previous work of our laboratory has shown that cooperative c ross-feeding interactions rapidly evolved between two Esc herichia coli genotypes that were auxotrophic for two dierent amino acids. Evolved auxotrophic consortia displayed signican tly increased consortium-level tness relative to derived populations o f metabolically autonomous, prototrophic cells. Moreover , derived aux- otrophic consortia showed an extensive degree of phenotypi c diversity, formed multicellular clusters and a signican tly improved growth relative to the ancestor. The main objective is to unr avel how the relatedness among coevolving auxotrophic geno types aects the evolution of cross-feeding interactions. To add ress this issue, pairs of auxotrophic genotypes will be set u p within the same and between dierent bacterial species and experiment ally coevolved to compare their propensity to engage in coop erative cross-feeding interactions. The expected results will pro vide unprecedented insights into the role relatedness play s for the evolution40 of cross-feeding among dierent bacterial genotypes and ma y thus help to explain the widespread distribution of such in teractions in nature. 25.Microenvironmental regulation of intra-tumor heterogenei ty. Sandeep Kumar and Shamik Sen, Department of Biosciences and Bioengineering, IIT Bombay, India. Heterogeneity within single tumor population referred as in tra-tumor heterogeneity has been observed in many experime ntal studies and has been implicated in development of multi-drug resist ance, increased cancer aggressiveness, and metastasis org anotropism. Understanding the mechanism(s) that induces this heterogen eity can signicantly improve our understanding of cancer p rogression and that knowledge can be used to identify novel cancer drugs and therapies. However, due to involvement of multiple lengt h/time scale processes and complex cell-cell and cell-surroundin g interactions, it is very dicult to study the emergence of i ntra-population heterogeneity within tumor population in purely experimen tal framework. To address this, we are using multi-scale com putational modeling approach augmented with experimental studies to u nderstand the emergence of phenotypical heterogeneity lik e hetero- geneity in cell size/shape, migration, and, its implicatio n in cancer metastasis. Specically, we are using cellular P otts model (CPM) cellular automata (CA)-based in silico understa nd how remodeling of extracellular matrix (ECM) as observed during cancer progression can alter the tumor population composit ion. During this meeting, I would like to discuss about some o f our recent ndings where we are studying how the connement geom etry, cell-cell adhesion and cell migration can cause the em ergence of intra-tumor heterogeneity. I will also discuss about som e of the relevant experimental observations pertaining to p opulations of HT-1080, MCF7 and MDA-MB-231 cells. spore p roductivity of social bacteria. Samay Pande and Gregory J. Velicer, Institute for Integrative Biology, ETH Zurich, Switzerland.Myxococcus xanthus is a predatory soil bacterium that exhib its vegetative growth and multicellular fruiting body deve lopment as two distinct life history stages. It was previously demonst rated that genetically heritable social variation within f ruiting bodies is common. However, factors that aect the maintenance of such n atural within-group variation remain unknown. We tested th e eects41 of within-group diversity on both total-group and individu al-strain spore productivity using eight representative i solates derived from a single natural fruiting body. Interestingly, total produ ctivity of chimeric populations containing all eight isola tes was higher than expected from monoculture controls. Further analyses sugg est that chimerism does not stimulate total productivity by aecting just one or two isolates, but rather a majority of the eight is olates respond positively to chimerism. We also tested for p air-specic interactions by performing all possible pairwise-mixes. I n these experiments, positive responses to mixing were more common than negative ones. Finally, we show that positive eects of mixi ng several isolates on total group productivity are specic to isolate sets that derive from the same fruiting body group, whereas e ects of chimerism on total productivity among isolates fro m dierent fruiting bodies were negative, and increasingly so as a func tion of mean distance between the soil sites from which fruit ing bodies were derived. Our study shows that chimerism among distinct but closely related individuals from the same natural socia l-group can enhance the absolute tness of a majority of group members. T hese studies also show the importance of incorporating info rmation on spatial locations of individuals for analyses of interac and Varsha Singh, Department of Molecular Reproduction, Development and Gen etics, Indian Institute of Science. Bacteria have been traditionally regarded as solitary indi viduals in a planktonic phase. In the past few decades it has i ncreasingly become clear that many cells can come together to form multi c ellular communities in the face of competition, predation a nd other unknown factors to ensure survival of the species. One such multi cellular community is called biolm. This is a sur face associated aggregate of mostly sessile cells covered in mat rix of secreted exopolysaccharides. Swarming population o f bacteria is a quorum dependent community but comprises motile bacteria t hat show rapid and coordinated movement over semisolid surf aces. Pseudomonas aeruginosa (PA) is a ubiquitous environmental o rganism that is also an opportunistic human pathogen in immu ne compromised individuals with cystic brosis, and in burn wo unds or diabetic foot ulcers. When solitary, PA can swim, twi tch or slide, but swarms or forms biolm when in a community and has reached quorum. The swarming patterns of PA comprise dendrites whic h branch at regular intervals reminding one of fractal patter ns. Since no two species of swarming bacteria produce simila r patterns, we are motivated to understand if motives and mechanisms of swa rming are distinct in these bacteria. Using PA as a model swarm ing bacterium, we use both genetic and modelling approaches to u nderstand the why and how 28.Clustering in sequences.Rahul Siddharthan and Ankit Agrawal , The of Mathematical India.A new way of clustering for high-throughput sequencing whic h divides the sequences into clusters.

Vidyanand Sasidharan , Institute for Stem Cell Biology and Regenerative Medicine, B angalore, India. The unique capacity of planarians to regenerate their centr al nervous system provides an opportunity to investigate me chanisms critical for adult neurogenesis. The brain regeneration in planaria is mediated by tightly orchestrated spatiotempor al regulation of gene expression critical for multiple aspects of neurogene sis. However, the mechanisms crucial for gene regulation ess ential for brain regeneration are largely unknown. Multiple studies have id entied microRNAs as key regulators of gene expression essent ial for diverse cellular processes in metazoans. Here, we report a no vel role of miR-124c in regulating axon guidance, organizat ion of brain and photoreceptors in regenerating planaria. Albeit highly conserved in metazoans and thought to regulate neural dier entiation, the role of the miR-124 family in neural wiring and brain orga nization is not known. Our study shows that miR-124c is expre ssed on day 3 post-amputation in the anterior regenerating tissu e of the planarians. We demonstrate its critical role in regu lating key pathways such as axon guidance and planar polarity, ess ential for accurate neural patterning and neural growth dur ing anterior regeneration. The with miR-124c KD showed ectopic e chat+ and expression of gad+, th+ neurons suggesting that miR-124c plays a pivotal role in the specication and organization of neuronal subtypes in t he planarian brain. Our study identied notch and the genes essential for axon guidance and planar cell polarity as direct targets of m iR-124c. We also showed that miR-124c regulate slit-1, a gene require d for axon guidance, by modulating the Notch pathway. Togethe r, our results reveal a novel role for miR-124c in regulating axon g uidance cues and the planar cell polarity pathway. This is es sential for precise neural growth and wiring, which is necessary for the regeneration of both functional brain and photoreceptors.43 30.Regulation of Cell Biology and Regenerative Medicine, Ba ngalore, India. Hemocytes govern various functions such as immune response, tissue remodeling, wound healing amongst others. A multitu de of signaling mechanisms regulate the development of hemocyte s, Notch signaling being one of them. Notch signaling pathway p lays a crucial role in many critical functions that include cell f ate specication, stem and progenitor cell development, ce ll survival and cell death. Interestingly in addition to these functions, o ngoing studies in our lab has shown that notch signaling in th e hemocytes respond to the nutritional cues. To understand this further , we perturbed notch in the hemocytes and we found that, mainl y lipid homeostasis in the organism is compromised. Our study aims t o decipher the mechanism by which Notch signaling in the hemoc ytes is responsible for maintaining lipid homeostasis. 31.Long range dispersal and its consequences Howard Stone and Cliord Brangwynne,The ecological and evolutionary dynamics of populations ar e shaped by the strategies they use to produce and utilize res ources. However, our understanding of the interplay between the gene tic and behavioral factors driving these strategies is limi ted. Here we report on a C. elegans-E. coli (worm-bacteria) experimenta l system in which the worm foraging behavior leads to a redist ribution of the bacteria, resulting in a growth advantage for both organ isms, similar to that achieved via farming. We show experime ntally and theoretically that the increased resource growth represen ts a public good that can benet all other consumers, regardl ess of whether they are producers or not. Mutant worms that cannot farm bact eria benet from farming by other worms in direct proportion to the fraction of farmers in the worm population. At the same ti me, the population dynamics of the bacteria is signicant a ected due to their long range spreading : we explore these consequence s in the contexts of diversity, competition and spread of evo lutionary novelties.44 32.Cell commitments to division during Cell Biology and Regenerative Medicin e and (2) National Centre for Biological Sciences, Bangalore, India.Under continuous glucose limited growth, budding yeast (S. c erevisiae) spontaneously undergo robust oscillations in o xygen consump- tion. During these oscillations, over half the yeast genome is periodically expressed, specifying a temporally separa ted orchestration of numerous processes and leading to distinct phases of grow th, cell division and quiescence-like states. We now unders tand that the entry into growth and division hinges upon an increase in a ce ntral metabolite, acetyl CoA, derived from glucose metaboli sm. How- ever, it remains unclear how only a sub-set of cells in the pop ulation enter into growth and cell division, and how these os cillations are maintained stably and indenitely as long as these nutrient limited conditions persist. We attempt to understand these oscillations using the notion of \"frustrated bistability\". Here, we posit that the cells can be in two stable states, either growing/di viding or quiescent. However this bistability is destabilised by the a ccumulation of intracellular nutrients (likely acetyl CoA) when most cells are quiescent. We show using mathematical models that this m echanism is sucient to trigger oscillations. This is a work in progress and we're exploring the space of such models, but we should be able to make testable predictions about how the oscillation s would be aected as we change parameters such as the influx rate of nu trients, the density of cells, etc. Our preliminary models a lready suggest that communication between cells is necessary "}
