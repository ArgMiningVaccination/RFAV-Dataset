Vaccine Rule 18(b) provides the parties 14 days to request redaction of any material \"(i) which1 is trade secret or commercial or financial information which is privileged and confidential, or (ii) which are medical files and similar files, the disclosure of which would constitute a clearly unwarranted invasion of privacy.\" 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 300aa12(d)(4)(B). Petitioners have waived their right to request such redaction. See Petitioners' Notice to Waive the 14-Day \"Waiting\" Period as Defined in Vaccine Rule 18(b), filed December 2, 2008. Respondent also waived the right to object to the disclosure of information submitted by respondent. See Respondent's Consent to Disclosure, filed January 14, 2009. Accordingly, this decision will be publicly available immediately after it is filed. \u00a7 300aa-10, et se q.

Therefore, in ord er to prevail, the y must d emonstrate by prepo nderant evidence: the injury; (2) a logical[4] sequen ce of cause and effect sh owing tha t the vaccinatio n was the reaso n for the injury ; and (3) a showing of a proximate temporal relation ship b etween vaccinat ion a nd injury .\" Althe n, 418 F.3d at 1278. See also Hines v. Sec'y, HHS , 940 F.2 d 1518, 1525 (Fed. Cir. 1 991). After co nside ring the reco rd as a whole, I hold that petition ers ha ve failed to establish b y prep onderant evidence that Colte n's con dition was ca used or signif icantly aggravated by a vaccine or a ny comp onent thereof.

A \"Table\" injury is an injury listed on the Vaccine Injury Table, 42 C.F.R. \u00a7 100.3, corresponding3 to the vaccine received within the time frame specified. Doctor Wiznitzer, one of the expert witnesses, explained that scientists use the terms4 \"hypothesis\" and \"theory\" with very specific meanings. A hypothesis is an idea proffered to explain an event. A theory is what is developed after a hypothesis has been subjected to many attempts to disprove it, and thus, it is likely correct. Cedillo Tr. at 1632, 1731A-35. This is an important distinction, but because much case law and many of the witnesses in this case have used the two terms as if they were interchangeable, I do likewise. 2could not reliab ly demonstrat e the presen ce of a persisten t measle s virus in Co lten's central ne rvous system . Petition ers failed to establish tha t measle s virus can cause autism o r that it did so in Colte n.

They failed to sh ow that Co m arked ly improved between his d iagnosis an d the hearing, th e experim ental treatments h e rece ived cann ot be logically or scien tifically linked to the theories o f causa tion. Given th e advice that petitione rs received f rom a treating ph ysician, Co lten's parents b rought t his act ion in good faith and upon a rea sona ble b asis. Ho wever, the y have f ailed to demonstrate vaccine causation of Colten 's cond ition b y a preponderance of the evidence . Therefore, I deny their pe tition for com pensation . Colten 's case was heard as p art of the largest om nibus proce eding in the histo ry of the Vaccine A ct. It was one of three test case s on the first of two theo ries of5 causa tion [\"Theory 1\"] ad vance d petitione in th e Om nibus Autism Procee ding [\"OAP\"]. Theory 1 is t hat a co mbinatio n of the MMR v accine and TCVs, a cting in conce rt, cau se so me ASDs. The other two cases involv ing Th eory 1 are Cedillo v.

Decisions on the second theory, that TCVs alone cause some ASDs, are pending before this court. See \u00a7 300aa-13(a): \"Compensation shall be awarded...if the special master or court finds on the6 record as a whole...\" See also \u00a7 300aa-13(b)(1) (indicating that the court or special master shall consider the entire record in determining if petitioner is entitled to compensation).

The Court o f Federal Claim s has noted that \"inste ad of being passive recipien ts of informa tion, such as ju rors, specia l masters a re giv en an active role in determin ing the facts re levant to Vaccine A ct petitions,\" a nd that \"the special m asters have th e expertise and experien ce to know the type of informa tion that is m ost p robative of a cla im.\" Doe v.

Weinste in, Improving Expert Test imony, 20 U. RICH. L.

Recognizi ng tha t case s involv ing the same vaccine a nd injury often involv e the same body of medica l expertise, t he Office of Special Mast ers [\"OSM\"] d eveloped the conce pt of omnibus proce edings to an swer the common question of whether a particu lar vaccine can cause th e inju ry in quest ion-the genera l causa tion question . The issue o f whether it did so in a specific case can then be reso lved more exped (Novembr 21, 1989) (Conference Report8 on the 1989 amendments stated that \"The system is intended to allow the proceedings to be conducted in what has come to be known as an 'inquisitorial' format, with the master conducting discovery (as needed), cross-examination (as needed) and investigation.\" ). With special masters experienced in Vaccine Act litigation, medical acronyms, for example, need not be explained anew to a special master who has heard such acronyms in numerous cases. Basic scientific evidence is often cursorily addressed by the experts, with the expectation that the special master will ask questions concerning any matters not completely clear. However, special masters are not doctors; thus they do not \"diagnose\" petitioners. Although due process concerns preclude the wholesale importation of evidence adduced in one proceeding to another proceeding without the consent of the parties, in omnibus proceedings, the parties consent to import evidence from the \"test case\" into other individual cases. Absent such consent, special masters advise the parties when they intend to consider evidence derived from their own efforts, usually in the form of medical journal articles, and permit the parties to comment on such evidence. Institute of Medicine [\"IOM\"] Reports, learned treatises, medical textbooks, medical dictionaries, or handbooks explicating medical abbreviations or tests are often consulted and referenced in the body of an opinion without formal notice to the parties. See, e.g., Stroud v. Sec'y, HHS, 113 F.3d 1258 (Fed. Cir. 1997) (special masters may rely upon an IOM report that neither party filed as evidence). 4base d on a ruling in an omnibus test case .9 At least two types o f omnibus proce edings have bee n developed . The first involv es applying ev idence developed in th e context of one or more ind ividual cases to other case s involv ing the same vaccine a nd the sam e or similar injury. See, e.g., Capiz zano v. Sec'y, HHS , 440 F.3 d 1317 (Fed. Cir. 200 6). T he secon d involv es hearing ev idence on a genera l theory of causation , making f indings ba sed on that evidence, and ordering the parties to file m atters esta blishing the extent to which th e facts o f individual ca ses f it within t he frame work de veloped. See, e.g., Ahern v. S ec'y, HHS , No. 90-1435V, 1993 U.S. Claims L EXIS 51 (Fed. Cl. Spe c. Mstr. In the rubella arth ropathy procee ding de tailed in Ahern, Special Mast er Hastin gs used the seco nd type of omnibus proce eding. He con sidered evidence developed on the genera l issue o f whether the rubella vaccine cou ld cau se ch ronic a rthritis or ot her joint p roblem s. The general ca usation e vidence was develope d in a procee ding in which t wo counse l represe nting a large num ber o f petitione rs and counsel f or respo ndent filed e xpert reports an d medica l journa l articles. Special Maste r Hastings then conducted a hearing in which th e medica l experts te stified. He p ublishe d an order settin g forth th e conclusion s he had rea ched from the evidence prese nted and filed it in each of the rube lla arth ropathy cases. Conclu ding tha t there was suf ficient e vidence that the rub ella vaccinatio n could ca use chron ic arthrop athy under sp ecified co nditio ns, he indicat ed that individual petitione rs would be entitled to co mpensa tion if they met all of those co nditio ns. He th en ordered a dditio nal filings by each petition er to esta blish whether they me t those criteria. Ahern, 1993 U.S. Claim s LEXIS 51, *46-55. See also Snyd er v. S ec'y, , (Fed. Spe mnibus dings, ho wever, have involv ed hearing ev idence and issuing an opinion in the context of a sp ecific case or case s. Then, by the agreem ent of the parties, th e evidence adduced in the omnibus p rocee ding is ap plied to other cases, along with any additio nal e vidence adduced in those particu lar case s. The partie s are thus not bound by the results in the test case , only agreeing th at the expert op inions and evidence formin g the b asis f or those opinions co uld b e conside red in addition al cases prese nting th e same theory of causation . For example, the common issue of whether Vaccine A can cause Disease X might be heard in9 the context of an individual case. If the special master determines that Disease X could, indeed, be caused by Vaccine A, the special master would also attempt to determine under what circumstances causation could be established, what specific symptoms would be required, and when those symptoms must manifest in order to attribute the disease or injury to the vaccine. The findings, issued in the context of deciding an individual case, would then provide guidance to the parties in other cases involving that vaccine and injury. Such findings might result in settlement or withdrawal of many pending cases without the necessity of additional hearings. Omnibus proceedings have resolved claims that the polio vaccine caused polio, that the rubella vaccine caused some arthritic conditions, and that the hepatitis B vaccine caused various demyelinating conditions. 5Both methods have pro ven efficient in resolving similar ca ses b y settlement or dism issal, ba sed on the special m aster's ana lysis of the scient ific evidence. Howev er, the seco nd method has th e disadvanta ge tha t the special m aster's findings am ount to an advisory opinion. Using the seco nd type of omnibus proce eding might w ell de lay final reso lution of affected cases, a s eith er pa rty might cont est a pplicat ion o f the evidence develope d, but have no case ripe f or ap peal until the general ca usation evidence is app lied to a particular ca se. B. The Omnibus Autism Procee ding. 1. Creation of the OAP . On Ju ly 3, 2002, Ch ief Special Mast er Go lkiew icz issued Autism General Orde r #1 [\"Autism Gen . Orde r # 1\"] to address issues arising f rom the unprece dented filing of more than 300 petitions for com pensation in a six-mon th period, all alleging tha t vaccine s cau sed a neurodevelopm ental diso rder kno wn as autism Gen. Orde r # 1 esta blished the OAP to proce ss ef ficiently and expeditiou sly the current ASD p etition s as well as th e large n umber o f anticipate d petition s prese nting th e same claims. 11 Autism G en. Orde r #1 and the OAP grew out of meetings w ith an informa l advisory com mittee comprised of members o f the petitione rs' bar, a nd legal and medical rep resen tatives of the respo ndent in Vaccine A ct case s, the Secreta ry of Health and Hum an Services. Au tism Gen. Orde r #1 noted that the large n umber o f petitions a lready f iled, a nd the even larger nu mber of anticipate d petition s, would12 stretch both the court's reso urces a the bar. Pe titione rs ackno wledged that their cases were no t yet read y for ad judicat ion, as th ey were se eking discovery and additiona l time for the completion of scient ific stud ies to bolster th eir claims. Cond ucting such discovery in th e context of an omnibus proce eding, rathe r than in individual case s, was clearly a more e fficient u se of resou rces of both the bar a nd the court. Autism and ASD are discussed in some depth in Section IV.10 The publicly accessible website contains the OAP master file, which includes orders, decisions,11 and periodic updates issued by the special masters assigned to the autism docket. Most of petitioners' and respondent's filings are posted on this website. Beginning in June 2007, audio files and transcripts of the hearings were also posted on this website. The text of Autism Gen. Order #1 may be found at 2002 U.S. Claims LEXIS 365 at *1 (Fed. Cl. Spec. Mstr. July 3, 2002); see also http://www.uscfc.uscourts.gov/node/2718 (last visited November 17, 2008). Over 5100 such petitions have been filed, approximately 4700 of which remain pending before12 the court. See Autism Updates, January 19 and March 14, 2007, available at http://www.uscfc.uscourts.gov/node/2718 (last visited on January 31, 2009). Since the OAP was established, over 375 petitions have been resolved by decisions, voluntary dismissals, or involuntary dismissals of petitions filed outside the statute of limitations. 6Autism G en. Orde r # 1 esta blished the PSC t o rep resen t the interests of petitione rs. Mem bersh ip on the PSC was de termined by the petitione rs' bar, with tw o attorneys selecte d by the com mittee to se rve as \"lead counsel.\" The PSC h as represe nted the gene inte rests o f autism petitione rs cont inuously since the incep tion of the OAP . Howev er, co unse l of record retain ed respo nsibility fo r all oth er asp ects o f their ow n ind ividual cases, includ ing keep ing clients inf orme d about the process, and obtaining m edica l records a nd other pe rtinen t documents. 13 Those petitione rs with ASD pe titions pending in th e Program a t the tim e Autism Gen. Orde r # 1 was issue d were pe rmitte d to \"opt in\" to the OAP , while retainin g the right to \"op t out\" at any time and return their ca ses to active stat us for resolu tion on an individual ba sis. Relat ively fe w petitione rs have availed t hemselves of this o pportunity14 to opt out of the OAP . New petitions filed a fter th e issua nce of Gen . Orde r #1 were to use a \"Short Form\" p etition forma t set forth in the order. See Orde r dated July 8, 20 02. By15 filing such a petition, the filer averr ed that: (1) th e vaccinee suffered from an ASD, o r autism-like diso rder, th at had persiste d for lon ger than six months; (2 ) the petition was filed within thre e years of onset o f that diso rder; a nd (3) a vaccine liste d on the Vaccine Injury Ta ble was th e cause of the condition . Chie f Special Mast respo ndent's co ncern s tha t the short form petitions would n ot permit evaluation of case s for the sta tutorily-requir ed docu mentation, but indicated that most e fficient m ethod for ha ndling th e overwhelm ing A few law firms represent substantial numbers of OAP petitioners, with three firms each13 representing more than 400 petitioners. Other attorneys represent only a few petitioners or even a single petitioner. Colten's case is somewhat unusual, in that it did not become a part of the OAP until February14 13, 2004. At the time his case was transferred to the OAP, medical records, test results, and a number of expert reports were already filed. As a result, some subsequent filings duplicated prior filings and some lacked exhibit numbers. Prior to the hearing in this case, I ordered each party to correct exhibit numbers and to file an updated index of their exhibits each time a new exhibit was filed. See Orders, dated August 30 and September 26, 2007 (adopting the new exhibit numbers). Those indices reflect the exhibit numbers referred to throughout this opinion. In the Vaccine Rule 4 reports filed in response to short form petitions, respondent continued to15 object to the short form procedure. 42 C.F.R. \u00a7 100.3.16 Section 300aa-11(c) of the Vaccine Act requires the petition to be accompanied by certain17 documentary evidence, including records pertaining to the vaccination and subsequent treatment. See also Vaccine Rule 2(e), RCFC, Appendix B. 7number o f case s.18 2. The OAP Discov ery Proce ss. All case s in th e OA P were assigned to Specia l Master Ge orge Hastings, who managed the discovery proce ss an d other matters a rising as the cases moved toward the goal of a hearing on the genera l causa tion issue. Based on a draft propose d by petitione rs' represen tatives, Au tism Gen. Orde r a master sched ule for resolvi ng the ASD ca ses. The sched ule in clude d a discovery period, f ollowed by a hearing on th e gene ral issue of causation , within two years of the OAP 's incep tion. For a variety of reaso ns, d elays ensu ed. Alth ough t he master sch edule anticipate d completion of discovery and designation of petitione rs' ex perts by August 2003, followed by petitio ners' e xperts' rep orts in Novembe r, 2003, those deadlines were subsu med by dispu tes a rising in th e discovery proce ss. A s Special Mast er Hastin gs noted in Jan uary, 200 4: It is, o f course, u nfortun ate that these discovery dispu tes a re de laying the progress of the Omnibus Autism Procee ding toward an eventu al he petitione rs' claims. Howev er, it is t he strate gic decision of the Com mittee [the PSC] to pursue furthe r discovery before th e petition ers' cau sation case . While I am eager to p rocee d to the prese ntation of the petitione rs' causa tion case, I will leave this strate gic decision t o the Com mittee. If the Com mittee believes th at it will be of advantage to the autism petitione rs tha t the Com mittee pursu e additiona l discovery before p resen ting tha t case , I will defer to the Com mittee. My role, instea d, will be to assist in facilitating th e discovery proce ss in a ny way that I can , and to be read y to prom ptly hear a nd rule upon the petition ers' cau sation case as so on as th e petition ers are ready to presen t it. Autism Up date and Order, Ja nuary 12, 2004. Most o f the discovery issues were a mica bly resolved, b ut so me remained contentious. Special Mast er Hastin gs issued ru lings on se veral issue s tha t cou ld no t be The PSC, counsel for respondent, and the OSM have developed and implemented a plan to18 supplement the short form petitions and to resolve expeditiously those cases with jurisdictional or other defects. Approximately 200 cases per month are added to the process, which entails the filing of sufficient medical records to make a determination whether the case was timely filed and whether the vaccinee has an ASD or similar condition. Further filings then ensue in those cases filed within the statute of limitations and properly assigned to the OAP. Once all the statutorily-mandated documents are filed, the remaining Theory 1 cases will be resolved, at least in part, by the causation evidence filed in the Cedillo, Hazlehurst, and Snyder Theory 1 test cases and the decisions of the special masters in these three cases. Of course, in accordance with Autism Gen. Order # 1, petitioners may withdraw from the OAP at any time. 8resolved by the parties. See, e.g., Autism Upda te and Order, d ated September 2 4, 2003. 3. Prepa ration s for Hea ring the T heory 1 Test Ca ses. Autism G eneral Order # 1 was w ritten in con templatio n of a \"gene ral cau sation hearing\" in March, 2004. At the request of the petitione rs, this h earing da te was postponed. In a lengthy Autism Upda te and Order issue d on August 1 1, 2005, Special Master Hast ings sum marized reaso ns for the delay in the original time table an d addressed a governme nt argument that he lacked the authority to delay the proce edings longer tha n 420 days. Alth ough h e declined to force p etition ers to try their cases before they w ere rea dy to do so, he set a January 31, 2006 deadline f or identification of expert wi tnesses. After request ing and receiving an enlargemen t of this deadline, petitione rs filed a list of 16 experts o n February 14, 2006 and filed a curriculum vitae [\"CV\"] f or ea ch of those experts on March 22 , 2006. On April 21, 2 006, Special Maste r Hastings de ferred t he filing of expert rep orts u ntil Dece mber 31 , 2006. On Ju ly 18, 2006, the PSC f iled a prop osal f or proce edings. T he PSC p roposed a new hearing da te in June, 2007, with the hearing cond ucted over a two-to-th ree week p eriod in which pet itione rs would prese nt evidence regarding all the ories f causation . The PSC o pposed consid eratio n of any specific case. In September, 2006, Special Mast er Hastin gs adop ted the PSC p ca usation h earing. He orde red p etition ers to file expert rep orts b y Februa ry 16, 2007, with resp ondent's expert repo rts to be filed 6 0 days later. At this20 21 point, it was still uncle ar whether the general ca usation issu es would b e conside red alone, or in th e context of a test ca se. The plan to consid er all th eories of causation at a single h earing w as lat er modified. As e arly as Ma y, 2006, it ap peared that the petitione rs might reque st to bifurcate the genera l causa tion issue in to two separate procee dings, on e addressing whether T CVs cou ld cau se autism and the other add ressing w hether the MMR v accine could cause autism . See Autism Up date, Ma y 16, 2006. On January 9, 2 007, the PSC proposed hearing a single a ctual case to test the theory that a combination of the MMR vaccine and TCVs cau sed ASDs. Subsequen t hearings to a ddress two othe r theories, One might fairly read Autism Gen. Order #1 as written in contemplation of the second method19 of conducting an omnibus proceeding, one similar to that used in the rubella arthropathy cases. They were actually filed on February 20, 2007, after yet another request for delay. 20 The many delays requested by petitioners to file their expert reports resulted in a highly21 compressed schedule in the final four months before the Cedillo hearing began. Until the petitioners' expert reports were filed on February 16, 2007, respondent did not know precisely what their theory (or theories) of MMR-TCV causation entailed. Thus, respondent's experts had a very tight time schedule in which to review petitioners' expert reports and the scientific and technical literature upon which they were based, and to prepare their own reports and supporting materials. 9one in which T CVs alo ne were ca usal (T heory 2), a nd the other in which th e MMR vaccine was ca usal (T heory 3) were plan ned. The PSC lat er de termined that hearing test cases involv ing Th eory 3 w ould not be necessary beca use the evidence pertaining to this th eory had been prese nted during the Theory 1 ca ses. See PSC No tice Re: Theory 3, dated August 7, 2008 and Autism Upda te, dated September 2 9, 2008.

The PSC o pposed the prop osal. Nevertheless, on January 11, 2007, Ch ief Special Mast er Go lkiew icz assigned two add itiona l specia l masters to the OAP docke t.

It was rea ssigned to me on June 11, 2007. The delays in d esignation of the seco nd and third test cases (Hazlehurst and Snyd er) meant that evidence pertaining to their specif ic facts co uld n ot be presen ted at the sche duled hearing be ginning on ne 11, 2007. con siderat ions, includin g enty iden tified e xpert witnesse s and in obtaining a courtroom large en ough t o accom modate the expected public interest in th e23 The three special masters issued joint orders permitting the designation of the test cases in the22 second two theories of causation to be delayed until after the hearings in the first three cases. See Autism Update, dated July 12, 2007, at 5-6. Hearings on the Theory 2 test cases took place in May and July, 2008. The Vaccine Act prohibits disclosure of information submitted to a special master to anyone23 who is not a party to the proceeding without the express written consent of the person who submitted that information. \u00a7 300aa-12(d)(4)(A). Thus, Vaccine Act hearings are not routinely opened to the public. Given the intense public interest in the autism cases and the probable applicability of the testimony in the Theory 1 OAP cases to thousands of other claims pending in the Program, petitioners waived the protection of the statute and asked that the hearing be opened to the public. After expressing initial concerns and opposition, respondent agreed to have the testimony (but not the entirety of the expert reports) publicly disclosed and withdrew objections to opening the Cedillo hearing to the public. 10hearing, ef fectively preclu ded granting an addition al de lay so tha t all th ree ca ses co uld be heard together.

See Snyder T ranscript [ \"Tr.\"] a t 1030-31, 1033-34. C. Evidence Const ituting th e Reco rd as a Whole. The evidence before m e thus inclu des all of the evidence , less t he medical records o f the other children , intro duce d before, during, a nd after th e hearings in Cedillo and Hazlehurst, as well as a ll of the evidence filed in this ca se. By Order, da ted Februa ry 9, 2009, I filed co mpact d isks cont aining th e evidence in Cedillo and Hazlehurst into the record of this ca se as Snyder Co urt Exhibits [\"Ct. Ex.\"] I and II, respe ctively. In m y preh earing orde r, I ind icated my intent to conside r, absent any objections, \"all evidence , to includ e expert reports, m edica l articles, a nd trial exhibits previously filed in the Cedillo and Hazlehurst case s, as well as in the OAP master file.\" Pretrial Orde r, \u00b6 2 f, dated September 19 , 2007. No o bjectio ns were f iled b y either party. 25 Many ex hibits, particu larly the medica l and scient ific journa l articles, f iled in this case were a lso filed in Cedillo or Hazlehurst. Such exhibits w ere o ften discusse d in the transcript or expert rep orts b y the exhibit nu mber use d in that case . To avoid confusion , I will ordin arily iden tify the exhibit by the designation used in th e transcript o r report, clea rly iden tifying the case name involv ed. For e xample, Pe t. Ex. 61, Tab D\" or \"Haz lehurst Res. E x. B.\" Additionally, the parties agreed to posting audio transcripts of the hearing testimony on the OSM website, to similar posting of the daily transcripts, and to \"listen only\" telephonic access to the hearing itself. Similar procedures were adopted in the Hazlehurst and Snyder hearings, with the exception of telephonic access. Hundreds of individuals dialed in to the Cedillo hearing; determining how many have accessed (or will access) the audio files or typed transcripts of the hearing is not possible. No specific agreement governs to what extent evidence adduced in the test cases can be used24 in resolving the approximately 4800 other cases, but, generally speaking, evidence developed in an omnibus hearing can, at the request of a party, be applied to subsequent cases. During the Snyder hearing, respondent's counsel initially lodged an objection to my25 consideration of Dr. Kennedy's testimony in the Snyder case on the issue of general causation, but immediately acknowledged he was in error. He then affirmed that I could consider all of the testimony in Cedillo and Hazlehurst. Snyder Tr. at 299A-300A. 11Many med scien iled ents or ta bs to26 expert repo rts; of ten, more than one expert attached the sam e article, resultin g in multiple e xhibit n umbers o r lette rs for the same document. In this d ecision, the article27 is prima rily iden tified b y one of the several exhibit de signations. When two experts discusse d the same article in testimony or expert repo rts, an d it is n ecessa ry to refer to their indiv idual interp retations o f the article, only one exhibit de signation is used . For examp le, a medica l journa l article m ight be identified a s \"Cedillo Res. Ex. D, T ab 36,\" even if it was also f iled a s a p etition er's exhibit in t his case . 28 At each hearing, some expert wi tnesses u sed slide p resen tations to aid the court in followi ng key points of their testim ony. Oth er do cuments were u sed in cross- examina tion or in reb uttal testim ony. T hese exhibits were designat ed as trial e xhibits, using the case name, the party of fering the exhibit, th e term \"trial exhibit\" an d conse cutive exhibit nu mbers. Fo r example , a trial exhibit f rom the Cedillo case might be designat ed as Ced illo Pet itione rs' Trial Exhibit 3 [\"Cedillo P et. Tr. Ex. 3\"] . A respo ndent's e xhibit f rom the er case might be designat ed Snyder Resp ondent's Trial Exhibit 6 [\"Sn yder Re s. Tr. Ex. 6\"] . In discussing the evidence in th is case, references to testimony are ide ntified with th e name of the case in which the testimony was giv en, the abbreviation \"T r.\" and the page num bers o f the transcript on which t he testim ony app ears.29 Respondent's expert reports identified most of the journal articles as \"attachments,\" rather than26 \"tabs,\" but the experts were not entirely consistent in this practice. For simplicity, throughout this opinion, any \"tab\" or \"attachment\" to an expert report is referred to as \"Tab,\" followed by the letter (petitioners) or number (respondent) assigned to it. The special masters assigned to the autism cases recognized the potential for confusion27 caused by multiple exhibit numbers for the same document. In the Theory 2 test cases, we ordered each party to produce a \"Master List\" of scientific and medical journal articles and similar documents. Even under this system, a document filed by both parties has two different exhibit designations. The fact that a particular medical journal article was filed by a particular party or by both parties28 does not constitute a party's endorsement of the article's premise or conclusions. Our practice is to require that a copy of any articles discussed (favorably or unfavorably) in an expert's report be filed with the report. A special master is not required to accept an expert report at face value (see \u00a7 300aa-13(b)(1) (indicating that \"any such diagnosis, conclusion, judgment, test result, report, or summary shall not be binding on the special master or court.\")) and may thus explore the basis for the expert's conclusions by reading and evaluating materials cited in the report. See also Perreira v. Sec'y, HHS, 33 F.3d 1375, 1377 n.6 (Fed. Cir. 1994) and Burns v. Sec'y, HHS, 3 F.3d 415, 417 (Fed. Cir. 1993). Accuracy problems with the original transcripts filed in each of the three cases resulted in29 numerous changes. Revisions were proposed by the parties and the agreed-upon changes were ordered by the special master assigned to that case. In an effort to avoid completely renumbering a transcript already referenced in post hearing briefs, pages with changes were designated by a letter \"A\" appearing after the page number. If transcript corrections resulted in an additional page, the original page number appears, followed by the letter \"B.\" 12The evidentiary record in th is case thus encompasse s, inter a lia, nearly four30 weeks of testimony, including th at offered in th e Cedillo and Hazlehurst case s; over 90 0 medical a nd scientif ic journa l articles; 5 0 expert reports (including several repo rts of witnesse s who did n ot testify); supplem ental expert rep orts f iled b y both parties p ost-31 hearing, the testim ony of fact witnesses on behalf of Colten , and Colte n's m edica l records. In additio n to presid ing over and hearing all of the testimony in Colten 's own case, I was prese nt for all o f the testimony in the Cedillo case and all of the expert testim ony in th e Hazlehurst case . Thus, my opinions on the credib ility of the witnesse s are b ased , in p art, o n my persona l obse rvation s of witness demeanor. D. Expert W itnesse s and Their Qu alification s. The expert w itnesse s includ ed, inter prof fered by respon dent, the rela tionsh ip of those qualif ication s to the subject matter o f their testim ony, an d the quality of their testim ony f ar exceed ed those of petitione rs' ex perts. For p urposes o f com parison of qualif ication s, I h ave gr ouped the experts by the ir primary fie ld of expertise; howev er, so me experts o ffered opinions in more than one scient ific discipline. For e xample, Dr. Ken nedy offered opinions in virology , immunology, and polymerase chain react ion [\"PCR\"] testing ; Dr. Rima32 offered opinions in vir ology and PCR testing.

T wo of petitione rs' witnesse s appeared to derive substantial in come from expert w itness fees. My evaluatio n of the quality of the testimony and the qualif ication s of the witnesse s offering tha t testimo ny is based , in p art, o n the factors the Suprem e Cou rt set The Vaccine Act requires the special master to consider the record as a whole. See 30 \u00a7 300aa-13(a): \"Compensation shall be awarded...if the special master or court finds on the record as a whole...\" See also \u00a7 300aa-13(b)(1) (indicating that the court or special master shall consider the entire record in determining if petitioner is entitled to compensation). Six expert reports prepared by Dr. Jeffrey Bradstreet were filed as exhibits in this case (Snyder31 Pet. Exs. 1, 17, 18, 21, 26, and 28) prior to the case's transfer to the OAP. Although Dr. Bradstreet testified at the hearing, his testimony was designated as that of a fact witness, as one of Colten's treating physicians. Pet. Prehearing Memo at 4.

I emphasize tha t my decision is not based solely on th e experts' rela tive importan t factor, it is no t, sta nding alone , determinative. A qualif ied e xpert with lesse r qualif ication s may of fer an opinion that, for a variety of reaso ns, is m ore p ersua sive than that of a more qua lified expert testif ying on b ehalf of an opposin g party. In evaluating ma tters co ntained in expert reports filed b y witnesse s who did n ot testif y, I have consid ered the experts' qualif ication s, as reflected in all of their filed curricula vitae [\"CV\"], t he extent t o which the experts' op inions were su pported by othe r evidence or testimo ny, the base s for their op inions, and the nature of their opinio ns offered in determining ho w much weight to acco rd the proffered opinions.

Payment for expert te stimo ny is ex pected, and the mere rece ipt of payment does not, of itself , cast doubt upon an expert's qualif ication s or o pinion s.

Just ice Ke ith heard the application on May 24, 2 007. He71 expressed some concern s about the lack o f notice to the U.K. claima nts, as well as to the brea dth of the materials bein g req uested. He se t another he aring f or Jun e 5, 2007. Cedillo S C Tr. at 15, 17-19. Base d on Justice K eith's co mments at the May 24 hearing, respo ndentth narrowed his re quest f or do cuments, rem oving from the original ap plication the request for the rep orts f rom petitione rs' ex perts in Cedillo and those of several oth er72 witnesse s. The revised a pplicat ion focuse d specifically on matters perta ining to measles virus and measles vaccine, but also69 commented on the reliability of Unigenetics' measles virus testing program. A signed copy of this report, along with accompanying medical literature, was filed as Cedillo70 Pet. Ex. 112 on June 1, 2007. A copy of that application was filed in Cedillo on June 8, 2007, as Attachment 2 to respondent's71 Notice of Filing. Respondent did not assign it an exhibit number. The original application to the U.K. court sought release of the reports filed by Drs. Kinsbourne,72 Krigsman, Byers, Wakefield, and Bradstreet (see Cedillo SC Tr. at 31), three of whom were witnesses in Cedillo (Drs. Kinsbourne, Krigsman, and Byers) and two of whom were witnesses in Snyder (Drs. Kinsbourne and Bradstreet). The amended application was filed by respondent as Attachment 3 to respondent's June 8, 2007 Notice of Filing in Cedillo. 37noted that attempts to obtain the rem aining tissue from Michelle Ced illo's gut biop sy for testin g were u nsucce ssful be cause Unigenet ics labo ratory no lon ger ex isted. Ced illo SC T r. at 19. Justice Keith considered the revised application in a June 5, 2007 hearing, a nd, on June 6, ruled that four e xpert reports cou ld be relea sed, subject perso nal cla imant informa tion. By the time of the Cedillo and OA P sta tus co nference73 on June 8, 2007, two rep orts were reda cted, relea sed to the respo ndent's co unse l, reviewed by them , and filed a s exhibits. A third report was red acted and release d to respo ndent's co unse l, and was awaiting r eview . The fourth repo rt was still pa rtially in transit between the U.K. and respo ndent's co unse l. Ced illo SC T r. at 20-22. During the June 8, 2007 sta tus co nference, p etition ers argued that none of the reports sho uld b e conside red a s evidence because they were u ntimely. Counse l noted that the hearing in Cedillo was sch eduled to begin in th ree d ays, on Ju ne 11, 2007. Petitione rs also n oted that they had sought relea se of U.K. litigation material throu gh third p arty subpo enas to Merck three years earlier, and that it appeared resp ondent74 had at a B ased on late filing and u nfair prejud ice, th ey asked that the informa tion obtained from the U.K. court be excluded. Apparently ignoring the fact that the U.K. court controlled rele ase of the U.K. litigation materials, pe titione rs renewed a request for the court to subpoena Merck and other manufacturers to o btain the rep orts o f all 65 experts in the U.K. litigation . Petitione rs cont ended that resp ondent's app lication to the U.K. co urt was a \"sovereign to so vereign\" request t hat received e xtraordin ary treatment. Fina lly, petitione rs objected to the court's consid eratio n of any repo rts if their auth ors w ould not be made available f or cross-examina tion. Ced illo SC T r. at 23-27. Petitione rs conce ded that they knew about attempts to obtain do cuments from the U.K. litigation more than two Justice Keith's Order was filed as Attachment 4 to respondent's June 8, 2007, Notice of Filing in73 Cedillo. See OAP Master File, July 16, 2004, Ruling Concerning Motion for Discovery from Merck RE:74 MMR Vaccine, in which Special Master Hastings denied the PSC's request for these materials. Given the U.K. court's protective order on witnesses, it does not appear that Merck could have released those materials without the consent of the U.K. court, even if ordered to do so by Special Master Hastings. The PSC counsel conceded as much when he noted that their experts who were also experts in the U.K. litigation were subject to protective orders and, therefore, could not discuss their knowledge of the U.K. proceedings. Cedillo SC Tr. at 36. However, nothing barred those experts from indicating that the U.K. litigation files contained material that might be relevant to the OAP litigation. Respondent also noted that Dr. Bustin's reports were not filed with the U.K. court until after the PSC's request for third party discovery from Merck. Cedillo SC Tr. at 43. 38weeks prior to this sta tus co nference. Ced illo SC T r. at 28. 75 Special Maste r Hastings con sidered petitione rs' object ions t o fall into two categories: (1) late notice a nd filing, makin g prepa ration to coun ter th e rep orts a t the hearing dif ficult, a nd (2) the limite d nature of the repo rts prod uced . With regard t o late notice, h e commented that petitione rs filed a number of documents (includin g one expert repo rt) after th e May 25 deadline . Ced illo SC T r. at 45-46. With regard t oth \"cherry picking\" only f our rep orts, h e proposed that the special m asters join resp ondent and petitione rs in a joint a pplicat ion to the U.K . cou rt for disclosu re of all ad dition al reports sou ght by eithe r side. Cedillo S C Tr. at 47-49. He also prop osed conducting the Cedillo and genera l causa tion hearings as plan ned on June 11, 2007, but recon vening at a later t ime to hear evidence derived from the U.K. expert repo rts to mitigate the prob lem with lat e notice and disclosu re. Ce dillo SC T r. petitione rs cont inued to object to any considerat ion o f matters d erived from the U.K. expert repo rts at the Cedillo trial, b ut did no t oppose having additio nal p rocee dings on ce full acce ss to the U.K. litigation materials w as obtained. Ced illo SC T r. at 53. Cou nsel f or the PSC agreed to request d isclosure o f76 the U.K. litigation documents. Ced illo SC T r. at 52. Resp ondent's coun sel expressed a willingness to join the court in requesting th e U.K . litigation m aterials. Cedillo S C Tr. at 54-55. Between the Cedillo hearing in Jun e, 2007, and the Snyd er hearing in Novembe r, 2007, it is un clear what, if anything, p etition ers w ere d oing to obtain the additiona l U.K. litigation materials. At the Snyder hearing, pe titione rs once again chara cteriz ed respo ndent's e fforts to obtain material f rom the U.K. litigation as a \"sovereign to sovereign\" req uest. Snyder T r. at 25, 1013A. Mr. Po wers, a ppearing as both a PSC a ttorney and as one of Colten 's atto rneys, argued t hat petitione rs' ex perts wanted to use inf orma tion from the U.K. litigation , but cou ld no t obtain it. He asserte d that witnesses f or the plaintif fs in th at litigation were \"be aten up for three years by the pharmace utical in dustry, being prevented from doing their job s, from treating patie nts, from running the lab, from publishing research and from teaching be cause they were barraged with endless inte rrogatories an d reque nd endless.\" Sn yder T r. no co ncern ing these asse rtions was f iled, it is uncle ar Powers obta ined his inf orma tion. Respondent's counsel identified the date of the status conference at which the pending request75 was discussed as May 23, 2007, and noted that petitioners' counsel merely requested a copy of any document received. Cedillo SC Tr. at 34. Petitioners in Cedillo later filed a motion to exclude the expert report and testimony of Dr. Bustin76 as duplicative. See Motion to Exclude, dated June 18, 2007, filed in Cedillo. Petitioners renewed the motion in a much expanded filing made on August 8, 2007. Petitioners later filed supplemental expert reports of Drs. Hepner and Kennedy in the Cedillo record to address Dr. Bustin's testimony and his reports from the U.K. litigation. See Cedillo Pet. Ex. 120 and 121. 39During the testim ony of Dr. Ken nedy in Snyd er, petitione rs' coun sel elicited that Dr. Ken nedy was aware o f material in th e U.K . MMR litig ation that would he lp est ablish the lab orato ry results from Unigenetics p CSF were credib le\" bu t that the informa tion was still un der se al by the U.K. court. Snyder T r. 350A-51 A. In respo nse to a question I posed , Dr. Ke nnedy indicate d that he had not been asked to supp ort th e rele ase of his o wn rep ort in the U.K. MMR litigation , and had no objection to its release . Snyder T r. 424A-25 A. After Dr. Ke nnedy's testimo ny, I no ted that som e five months earlier, the three specia l masters h ad invited the petitione rs to a pply to th e U.K . to seek relea se of whatever mat ters f rom the U.K. MMR li tigation t hey desired . In respo nse to my question s, cou nsel f or the PSC (w ho appeared as co-cou nsel o n behalf of Mr. and Mrs. Snyder an d Colte n) ind icated that \"the y\" (presum ably ref erring to th PSC) had made inquiries, bu t were inf orme d by outside coun sel th at they could not obtain the informa tion. He a lso sta ted that petitione rs' coun sel was actively investigating w hat needed to be done to gain relea se of documents. I noted that the governm ent77 obtained rele ase of the four rep orts request ed from the U.K. MMR li tigation in a far shorte r period than the five months between t he June 8, 2007 sta tus co nference and the Snyd er hearing. I u rged petitione rs to p rocee d with spee d and diligence. Snyder Tr. at 433A-35A . On ce again, resp ondent's coun sel be supp ortive of petitione rs' ef forts to obtain release of addition al inf orma tion from the U.K. litigation . Snyder T r. at 435A. During cross-ex aminatio n of Dr. Rima, petitione rs' coun sel aske d a series o f question s con cerning prop osed retesting of som e of the U.K. claima nts' sa mples. Snyder T r. at 920A-23. During this t estim ony, Dr. Rima referred t o a confidentiality order. Sn yder T r. at 923. It was not entirely clear f rom his te stimo ny that the confidentiality order to which h e referred was f rom the court, as it appeared that this discussion involv ed experts w orking w ith th e attorneys represen ting the U.K. defendants and, thus, may have involv ed attorney w ork-produ ct. A t that point, Mr. Powers asked for lea ve of court to file a su pplemental repo rt once th e rem aining matters f rom the U.K. litigation were u nsea led. I inquired when petitione rs expected to make th e reque st to the U.K. court to release addition al matters, an d Mr. Po wers respo nded that the \"process h as begun.\" Snyder T r. at 923-24. After describing f ive months of no apparent progress in requestin g release, I informe d counse l that petitione rs nee ded to move speedily. Snyder T r. at 924-25. Petitioners' counsel's characterization in Snyder of the efforts to obtain additional U.K. reports77 differs from the statement that appears in the notice the PSC filed on July 31, 2008. See PSC Notice Re: UK Litigation Materials and the First Theory of General Causation [\"PSC Notice Re: UK Litigation\"] at 2 (\"In the period between the Cedillo and Snyder hearings, the petitioners sought, unsuccessfully, to obtain the claimant-side reports from the UK.\"). This statement implied that petitioners actually made some effort to obtain the U.K. litigation materials. It was apparent to me from Dr. Kennedy's testimony that his support for release of his report had not been sought, and from the on-the-record response of counsel to my questions, that petitioners' efforts to obtain these materials had not progressed to the stage of making any application, or, indeed, anything beyond talking about the process. See Snyder Tr. at 924-25. 40Later in t he hearing, ano ther of petitione rs' coun sel, Mr. W ickersham , expressed his con cern a nd willingness to do what was nece ssary to obtain the U.K. e xpert reports, commenting th at his experts w ere a ll willing to waive any object ions t o the rele ase of their reports. He reque sted that I su bpoena the repo rts from the U.K. court. I noted that the Hague Conventio n governed subp oenas in foreign jurisdiction s, an d that a subp oena for a docu ment under seal was no t the norma l method of obtainin g it. Once again, re spon dent's cou nsel o ffered to in o btaining any docu ments they sought, an d sta ted that U.K. law allow ed third p arties, includin g priv ate litigants, to obtain m atters filed u nder seal. Snyder T r. at 1011A-13 A. Between Novemb er, 2007, and July, 2008, the special m asters repea tedly raised the issue of petitione rs' atte mpts to obtain additiona l evidence from the U.K. MMR litigation at our p eriodic st atus con ferences with the parties. A t no point did the PSC indicat e that an applicat ion h ad actually been made. All th ree sp ecial m asters sig ned a letter indicat ing our su pport for relea se of the documents sou ght by petitio ners. 78 Several of the experts who prep ared repo rts for the U.K . cou rt agreed to the release of their work. O thers, includ ing Drs. Orla She ils and John O'L eary, w ere a pparently unwill ing, as th ey reported ly did not respo nd to efforts to contact them. Ultima tely, base d on the delay and expense that would be involv ed in litigating the release of som e reports w ithou t the consen t of the experts, t he PSC ch ose not to seek the relea se of any of the addition al expert rep orts. See PSC No tice Re: UK L itigation a t 2. It may well be true that the petition ers' ef forts to obtain additiona l material f rom the U.K. MMR li tigation would h ave bee n entirely unsucce ssful. Ho wever, base d on the prece dent establishe d by Justice Keith's relea se of four e xpert reports, it a ppears th at, at a minimu m, petitione rs could have obtained the repo rts of their ow n experts and those of any of the respo ndent's e xperts. Because the application to the U.K. court was never ma de, we sim ply do no t kno w what the court would have done. Petitione rs atte mpted on several occa sions t o shift the resp onsib ility for requesting such evidence from their shou lders to the court's. In each ca se, the court decline d to shoulder petitione rs' burde n, while, ne verthe less, su pporting petitio ners' efforts b y conveying the court's desire t hat the evidence be relea sed. I note that petitione rs failed to lodge an y specific obje ction in Snyd er to my consid eratio n of the expert rep orts o f Dr. Bust in, in contrast to the motion s to strike his expert repo rts, te stimo ny, and trial prese ntation filed sugg n PSC No tice Re: UK Litigation at 2-3, sta ting tha t they would rest o n the reco rd de veloped in the three test Petitioners noted that they had requested that the special masters make a request for these78 documents directly to the U.K. court. As respondent had requested and received such reports without aid of the court, we placed the burden on petitioners to make a request for documents they deemed relevant on their own. It was clear at the conclusion of the Snyder hearing that the burden to make the request was petitioners. See PSC Notice Re: UK Litigation at 2. 41cases, \"a reco rd includ ing object ions t o the admission o f evidence from the UK a s was introd uced during these hearings.\" Assum ing, arguendo, that this erence is a belated objection to my consid eratio n of any of the material release d by the U.K. court, and testimo ny deriv ed from such material, I overrule the objection . Whatever v alidity the \"u nfair\" surprise an d lack of time to prep are for cross-examina tion argume nts h ad at the Cedillo hearing had evaporat ed by the t ime of the Snyd er hearing f ive months lat er. P etition ers w ere free to request t hat Dr. Bust in retu rn for ad dition al cross-examin ation at eithe r of the two test case hearings subseque nt to Cedillo . Their f ailure t o do so constitute s waiver. With regard t o their inab ility to examine any evidence underlyi ng Dr. Bustin 's and Dr. Rima's critiques o f Unigenet ics labo ratory's r esults, petitione rs also waiv ed any objection by their f ailure t o reque st disclosu re of such materials f rom the U.K. court. As the testimony discussed in Section s VII and VIII, below, makes abundantly clear, volum inous materials w ere filed with the U.K. court regarding the laboratory's operation s. Althou gh Unigenetics is n o lon ger in bu siness, the U.K. court is. Given th e amount of impassion ed argume nt devoted to the petitione rs' nee d for such materials, petitione rs' failure t o lod ge a reque st for their disclosu re in t he months followi ng all thre e Theory 1 hearings is ine xplicable . It is also waiver. Petitione rs introdu ced a belate d expert report from an entirely new witness, Dr. Karin He pner, attesting to the validity and reliab ility of Unigenet ics' testing pro gram. Equally belated ly, but with a far be tter e xcuse, respo ndent answered th is evidence with filings from the U.K. litigation . By the time of the Snyd er hearing, pe titione rs had not taken even the most b asic ste ps to obtain what they contended was favorable e vidence crucial to their case. Their Ju ly 31, 2008 filing, inf ormin g the co urt th at they w ere n o longer see king to o btain this evidence from the U.K. court, waives any object ion to the court's co nside ration of the U.K. materials int roduced. The issue o f the weight I h ave accord ed such evidence is add ressed below. Section II. Petitioners ' Theorie s of Caus ation. Most o pinion s of the special m asters who hear Vaccine Act cases begin with a discussion of the medica l records a nd medical co nditio n of the individual claim ing the vaccine injury. Giv en the com plexity of the evidence in th is case and of the condition from which Co lten suffers, I choo se to begin w ith th e gene ral cau sation evidence . After evaluating th at evidence, I discuss Colten 's me dical h istory and treatment, and then apply the genera l causa evidence 's me dical h istory , diagnosis, an d treatment will be b est understoo d after co nside ration of the genera l causa tion evidence. In this sect ion o f the opinion, I first discuss t he general t heories of causation upon which Colten 's claim for com pensation rests. In Section III, I set forth the applicable la w and sta ndards for ad judicat ing Vaccine Act Cases. Section IV is d evoted 42to explainin g ASD. In Sections V-VII, I set forth and discuss the genera l causa tion evidence. Colte n's own m edica l history app ears in Section VIII. In Section IX, I ap ply the law to the facts o f Colten 's case and explain why I have conclu ded that petitione rs have no t met their b urden of proo f. This m ethod of proce eding in no way ref lects a ny lack of importan ce for Colte n's specif ic claim for com pensation . As the court and counse l for bo th parties ackno wledged at Co lten's h earing, th is case prese nts b oth a gen eral ca usation theory and a sp ecific causa tion claim. Snyder T r. at 6-7, 16-17. evidence develope d in the genera l tion case was inous and complex, and Colten 's specif ic situat ion ca n be best e xamined and understood in light of the scient ific the ories u pon which it is base d. The court is dee ply g rateful to Colten and his pare nts for agreeing to have his case prese nted as one of the first three test case s on the com bined theory of causa tion. Petitione rs are ca ring and committed parents who h ave f ocuse d consid erable tim e, effort, a nd rces on Colten 's me dical tre atment, education al ne eds, and gene ral w elfare. No o ne who obse rved the hearing could doubt their comm itment to Colte n, or their good faith belief that Colte n's con dition is the result of his ch ildhoo d vaccines. They have act ed on that belief in determining m any of the treatments Co lten has received. I n this respe ct, th ey mirror the anecdotal acco unts of the struggl es of many oth er pa rents of autistic children . Howev er, in this co urt, a s in a ll other cou rts, sub jective belief is insuf ficient of causation . See 13(a)(1). Part V etition ers' Hearing Brief [\"Snyder Pe t. Post He aring Br.\"], filed Fe bruary 19, 2008, discusse d both the genera l theory of causation and the evidence specif ic to Co lten. Borrowing from the subheadings in th e brief, the building blocks o f their theo ry can be expressed as: (1) the ethylmercury in TCVs is an imm une MMR v an immune suppressa nt; (3) the com bined effect o f both TCVs an d the measle s vaccine virus sup presse d the immune system of at least some children who rece ived both; (4) this im munosu ppression p ermits the measle s virus to persist in th ese children ; (5) a persiste nt measle s virus can enter th e brain a nd cause a neurological injury ; and (6) that neurological injury can inclu de autism o r ASD sympto ms. The theory itself is complex, imp licating me dical co nditio ns and scientif ic disciplines ranging f rom epidemiology to virology . Each of these building blocks has its own com ponent parts. T he evidence prese nted inclu des both uncon troverted f acts (f or examp le, th at the measles virus ma y persist in som e ind ividuals) and vigorously litigated co ntention s (for examp le, th at persiste nt measle s virus can cause autism ). It nece ssitate s discussio n of the reliability 43of in vitro studies, animal stud ies, specific types of scient ific testin g and the79 80 laboratory in w hich so me tests were p erforme d. In additio n to epidem iology and virology explore pediatric n eurology, and toxicology . Altho ugh th e OA P petition ers includ e children with ma ny dif ferent diagnoses o n the autism spect rum, the genera l causa tion theory prese nted in the Theory 1 test ca ses was lim ited to a specific type of ASD, one with regressiv e features. Regressiv e autism is discusse d in more de tail be low, but in the context presen ted here, it rep resen ts a cond ition a rising in th e second year of life, after apparently norm al de velopment. In Colten 's specif ic case case, petitione rs relied u pon the theory that the TCVs an d MMR, acting in co ncert, caused Colten 's cond ition, which was \"aut istic symptoms\" or \"regr essive autism .\" See, e.g., Pet. Post He aring Br., p p. 6, 9. They did not advance a signif icant aggravation cla im, instea d contending that Colten was a healthy, hap py child un til receipt of his MMR v accine . Howev er, im plicate d in their theory is the underlyi ng prem ise th at Co lten is one of a sm all m inority of children who are \"hypersusce ptible \" to the effects o f the ethylmercury containe d in some of his e theo ry began wi th evidence regarding mercury 's effects o n the immune system , I begin the discussio n of the evidence prese nted with the evidence concerning AS D itself , followed by the evidence perta ining to mercury tox icology and immunology, measle s virus an d vaccine, and, finally, the specif ic aspe cts of Colten 's case, testing, and treatments. 79 An in vivo study is one that is done in an intact animal or human being. In vitro studies involve cells taken from an animal or human that are grown in a petri dish and subjected to experimental conditions. The results from in vitro studies cannot be extrapolated to demonstrate what would happen in vivo. Cells in culture are in an environment metabolically very different from that within the intact subject. Cedillo Tr. at 2321-23. In vitro studies are useful for generating hypotheses. If a substance does not cause harm in vitro, then it will not cause harm in vivo. If it causes harm in vitro, then further study is warranted. Cedillo Tr. at 2324. The Institute of Medicine has acknowledged this scientific principle, commenting that \"an adverse effect ... in vitro does not readily translate into a physiologic argument.\" Immunization Safety Review, VACCINES AND AUTISM, IOM, National Academies Press, 2004 [\"IOM 2004 Report\"], filed as Cedillo Res. Ex. JJ, at 140. Confronted with scientific evidence derived from in vitro studies, courts have required some supporting evidence indicating the results can be extrapolated. See, e.g., Richardson v. Richardson-Merrell, Inc., 857 F.2d 823, 830 (D.C. Cir. 1988) (holding in vitro studies insufficient evidence of causation in humans in the face of overwhelming contradictory epidemiologic studies). Animal studies have limitations because the effects of a drug may differ in animals and80 humans. For example, saccharin causes cancer in rodents, but not in humans. Tylenol, even in extremely small doses, is lethal to cats. Cedillo Tr. at 2334. See, e.g, Goewey v. U.S., 886 F. Supp 1268 (D.S.C. 1995) (neurotoxic effects of substance in chickens cannot be extrapolated to humans, absent some epidemiologic confirmation). See also General Electric v. Joiner, 522 U.S. 136, 144-45 (1997) (district court did not abuse its discretion in excluding animal studies that did not involve the same modes of exposure as in humans). 44Section III. The Le gal S tandards to be A pplied . This sect ion a ddresses th e legal sta ndards to be applied in gene ral in Va ccine Act ca ses. The legal argume nts co ncern ing the application of these sta ndards to Colten 's specif ic case are a ddressed Se ction VIII, below. Vaccin e Act pe titione rs mu st est ablish each of the three Althe n factors: (1) a medical th eory causa lly connecting the vaccina tion and the injury; (2) a logical sequen ce of cause and effect sh owing tha t the vaccinatio n was the reaso n for the injury ; and (3) a proximate temporal relation ship b etween vaccinat ion ntial e and medical o pinion s may be su fficient t o satisfy the seco nd Althe n factor. Capiz zano, 440 F.3 d at 1325-26. The medical th eory f actor doe s not require pe titione rs to e stablish iden tification and proo of specific biological m echa nism s, as \"the purpose of the Vaccine A ct's preponderance sta ndard is to allow the f inding of causation in a field b ereft of com plete and direct proof of how vaccines af fect the human body.\" Althe n, 418 F.3 d at 1280.

Petitione rs ma y not be required to show \"epid emiologic studies, rech allenge, the prese nce of pathologic markers o r genetic d isposition , or general a ccept ance in th e scien tific or m edica l com munities t o establish a lo gical ce of and at 1325.

Close calls regarding causa tion must be resolved in favor of the petitione r. Althe n, 418 F.3 d at 1280. But see Knudse n, 35 F.3d at 550 (when evidence is in e quipoise, the party with the burden of proo f failed to meet that burden). When a petition er alleges a n \"off-Table\" inju ry, eligibility for com pensation is established when, by a p reponderance of the evidence , petitione r dem onstrates that he: (1) received a vaccine set forth on the Vaccine I njury Tab le; (2) rece ived the vaccine in th e Unite d States; (3) sust ained an illness, disea se, d isability, or cond ition cause d by the vaccine (or experien ced a signif icant aggravation o f an illness); a nd (4) the prob lem has persisted f or more than six months. Vaccine litigation rarely81 conce rns w hether the vaccine appears on the Table, the situ s for ad ministration , or Section 300aa-13(a)(1)(A).

Ced illo Res. E x. P at 6-7; Ced illo T r. \"Differential diagnosis\" is the diagnostic technique of including possible causes for a patient's93 condition, then ruling out causes until one is left (or selecting the most likely cause from those remaining). It is a central feature of medical science. What is unstated in this process, however, is that the resulting diagnosis is valid only if the original list of possible causes is limited to causes properly \"ruled in.\" That is, there must be some reliable scientific or medical basis for putting a cause on the list of possible causes in the first place. The first Althen prong encompasses this point by requiring petitioners to advance a reliable medical theory for vaccine causation. See Althen, 418 F.3d at 1278. See 2008 WL 3522297 (Fed. Cl. Spec. Mstr. July 24, 2008) and Ruggerio v. Warner Lambert Co. 424 F.3d 249, 254 (2d Cir. 2005); Restatement (Third) of the Law of Torts: Liability for Physical Harm \u00a7 28 (2005). 501281A-82 A. Aspe rger de scribed the disord er that bears h is nam e in 1944. Both Kanner a nd Aspe rger also noted that som e parents of children with th e described disorde rs had persona lity characteristics sim ilar to t he behavioral dif ficulties in their children , an observation that prompted Asperger to su ggest a genet ic com ponent to the disorde r. See A. Bailey, et al., Au tism: the Phenotype in Relatives , 28 J. AUTISM DEV. DISORDERS 369 (199 8), filed a s Cedillo P et. Ex. 61, Tab E. In the 1960s and early 1970 s, au tism was se en as a psychiatric disorde r. In 1967, Bruno Bettleheim published The Empty Fo rtress: In fantile Au tism and the Birth of the Self, setting f orth his be lief that the emotiona l detachm ent seen in many autistic children was th e resu lt of poor pa rentin g, specif ically the mother's f ailure t o bond with her in fant. The rate of autism diagnosis was very low during this pe riod, p erhaps reflecting the social st igma au tism spect rum disorde rs have evolv ed since t he cond ition was f irst describe d by Kanner. In 1968, at the time of the initial e pidemiologic studies of autism, the DSM ha d no provisions f or childh ood psychiatric disorde rs, w hich is what autism was th en consid ered to be. Thus, there were n o agreed-upon diagnostic criteria f or the conditio n, other than those posite d by Kanner. Ced illo T r. at 2513A. See also Cedillo Re s. Ex. HH at 2 2.

Fombonne, Cook, and Rust , and introduced a number o f epidem iologic studie s97 Absent other evidence linking these events (increased vaccinations and increased incidence of96 ASD), a statistical correlation between the two would be an example of the \"ecological fallacy.\" An ecological fallacy occurs when a correlation between an agent and a disease in a group cannot be reproduced when individuals are studied. Reference Manual on Scientific Evidence, 2d Ed. Federal Judicial Center, 2000 \"[\"Reference Manual on Scientific Evidence\"] at 391. Epidemiology is the study of the distribution of disease in human populations and of the factors97 that influence that distribution. Cedillo Tr. at 2501. There are two major types of epidemiologic studies-the cohort study and the case-control study. The cohort studies are also called incidence studies. They compare the new onset of a disease in two groups of individuals, with one group exposed to something and the other group unexposed. By following the two groups over a period of time, and measuring the incidence of the disease in the exposed and unexposed groups, it is possible to determine if the exposure played a role in the development of the disease. If the incidence of the disease is the same in both groups, the exposure is unlikely to have had an effect on the development of the disease. Cedillo Tr. at 2501-02. A case-control study starts with a group of individuals with a disease and compares those individuals to a group without the disease. Working retrospectively, the investigator measures past exposures of both groups in order to find exposures that appear to be higher in the group with the disease. The exposures of the two groups are compared, producing what is called an \"odds ratio,\" which is a 52indicat ing that there is no reliable evidence of an actu al increa se in the incide nce of ASDs. Doctor Fo mbonne agreed that prevalence rat es for au tism are h igher now than in pre vious d ecad es, b ut asserted that much, if not all, o f the increa se ca n be attribut ed to better ascerta inment, revised dia gnostic criteria, awareness, diagnost ic subst itution , and in educational policies. Cedillo T at 2512-15A, 2521A-23 A. In su mmary, resp ondent contended that there is in adequate data to establish th at rates o f autism are, in fact, rising . There was gene ral agreem ent on the rate of ASD in the U.S. The U.S. e stima te of 60-70 ca ses p er 10 ,000 was derived from data from 14 different states. Illustrat ing98 some of the prob lems in ca se ascertain ment, the rates am ong th e sta tes su rveyed were highly variable, with Ne w Jersey having an incid ence of 107 per 10 ,000. In contrast,99 the rate in Alabama was 32-33 per 10,000, only 1/3 of the New Jersey rate. Ced illo T r. at 2510A-12. The diagnost ic source s use d affect the prevalence rates found. When multiple source s are used to identify or ascertain a diagnosis of ASD, the rate per 10,000 rises. One prob lem in co mparing rates a mong stud ies is th at studies use different ascerta inment criteria, resu lting Fom bonne used four d ifferent studies in the U.S., published between 1999-2001, to demonstrat e a 14-fold d ifference in the rate of ASD p er 10 ,000.

Prior to 1994, there was no requirem ent for scho ol districts o r measure of relative risk. Cedillo Tr. at 2502. Two other types of studies are also used: prevalence studies (also called cross-sectional studies) and ecological studies. Prevalence studies look at a population at a single point in time, and assess all of the individuals in the sample for disease and the characteristics suspected to be associated with the disease. Cedillo Tr. at 2502-03A. Ecological studies look at rates of a particular disease over time and compare those rates to exposure levels over the same period. An example of an ecological study would be comparing unemployment rates and suicide rates. If suicide rates go up as unemployment rates also rise, that might indicate there is a relationship between the two events. The inferences that can be drawn from ecological studies are less strong than those from cohort or case-control studies because ecological studies rely on aggregated, rather than individual, data. In the example of suicide and unemployment, an ecological study would not look specifically at individuals who had committed suicide to ascertain their employment status at the time, but simply at aggregated population data.

Diagnoses I nclud ed in the Autism Spectrum . Within t he U.S., the stan dard diagno stic criteria are found in the DSM-IV-TR. 104 Beca use the criteria are very broa d, ch ildren with the sam e DSM-IV d iagnosis m ight prese nt with very different sympto ms. Moreo ver, th e sympt oms displa yed by an individual child might ch ange o ver tim e. In clinica l prese ntation, children with th e same diagnosis, includin g the sa me subgroup on the autism spect rum, may have dif ferent levels of severity of impairme nt. Cedillo T r. at 1592-94. The key fe atures of each DSM-IV classif ication within t he PDD um brella a re sum marized below. a. Autistic Disorders. To be diagnosed with autistic d isorder, t he DSM-IV requires tha t a child m ust display abn orma l developm ent in th e three d ifferent domains of : (1) lan guage an d communicatio n; (2) social int eractio n; and (3) repe titive patterns of play, be havior, or intere sts. A lthou gh the behavioral ma nifestations must occu r before three years of age, the diagno sis itself may be m ade much later. Cedillo T r. at 1263-64, 1591-92. In the domains o f com municatio n and socialization, t he impairme nt must b e qualitatively significa nt. Cedillo T r. at 1589-91. The behaviors must reflect six of the subcrite ria in th e three d omains. At least two of the six subcriteria m ust b e from the socialization d omain; there must b e at least on e behavior from each of the other two domains. Cedillo T r. 1265A-66A, 1617-18. Addition ally, the behavior mu st con stitute a functional imp airme nt that actu ally causes p roblem s in so cializ ation , com municatio n, and play. Fina lly, the behaviors mu st no t be explainab le by ano ther medical o r psychiatric disorde r, such as Re tt's diso rder. Ce dillo T r. at 1618. b. PDD-NOS. If a ch ild do es not meet all of the diagno stic criteria f or au tistic disord er, th en other dia gnoses a re en tertained. A child who clea rly meets the diagno stic criteria in t wo of the three domains, but has a d ysfunction in the third domain that is no t sufficiently severe to meet the diagnost ic criteria, would be classif ied a s having pervasiv e Cedillo T r. at 1592. Children who are diagnose d later in lif e are often given this d iagnosis. I n many cases, these ch ildren a re In Europe, the criteria are found in the 10 edition of the International Classification of Diseaseth 104 Manual [\"ICD-10\"]. The ICD includes the full range of medical disorders, with one chapter devoted to psychiatric disorders, including autism. That one chapter is the equivalent of the DSM-IV-TR. In most cases, the data collected lead to the same diagnosis under either the ICD-10 or the DSM-IV-TR criteria, and thus, studies using either criteria can be reliably compared. Cedillo Tr. at 2617A-19. Doctor Fombonne, who was part of the group that developed the diagnostic criteria for both manuals, testified that there are very few differences between them.

Many of the highly functioning ind ividuals with ASD are classif ied a s having Aspe rger's disorde r. In Asperger's, language d evelops n orma lly. By two y ears o f age, a child with Asperger's disorde r might h ave a vocabu lary of multiple words. Conversation al im pairm ents are subtle. Intelligence is in th e norma l range. However, those with Aspe rger's f requent ly displa y clear so cial imp airme nts. Rett's r.105 ic DSM-IV PDD dia gnosis w ith a defined cause.

Hagberg, Clinical Manifestations and Stages of Rett Syndrome, MENTAL RETARDATION107 DEVEL. DISABIL. RES. REV. 8: 61-65 (2002), filed as Cedillo Res. Ex. DD, Tab 6. The author, one of the first researchers to describe the condition, describes classical Rett's disorder as relatively normal development for the first six months of life, followed by delayed, but not significantly abnormal, development during the following year. The onset of clear developmental regression, with loss of acquired skills, occurs between the ages of one to four years. This regression is followed by a \"pseudostationary period\" during which some skills are regained, but an unapparent and slow neuromotor regression occurs. The final stage involves complete loss of ambulation. Id., Table 3. For a more detailed description of this disorder, see E. Fombonne, Prevalence of Childhood108 Disintegrative Disorder, AUTISM 6(2): 149-57 (2002), filed as Cedillo Res. Ex. P, Tab 62. 562. Dom ains o f Impairm ent. a. Com municatio n Dom ain. Example s of com municatio n abnormalities include langua ge dela y, lack o f babbling in a communicative con text, or lack of pointing or gestu ring to com municate something othe r than needs or d esires b y the age o f 8-12 months. In older ch ildren, or in high-f unctioning childre n, the types of com municatio n abnormalities are d ifferent and may includ e idio syncratic se ntences lite dersta nding of words. Cedillo T r. 1266A-69 A. Lack of, or d elay in, lan guage de velopment does not includ e children who p oint, gesture, or mime in an effort to com municate . An ina bility to initiate or to susta in a conversation can indica te a marked qualitative imp airme nt of com municatio n in children who have an otherwise ad equate vocabula ry. Such children might sing a jingle f rom a restau rant advertisem ent to communicate that they are hu ngry or want to go to a particu lar restau rant, rather than asking to go the re. Ch ildren who rep eat conversation s, as if from a script, demonstrat e a stere otyped or repe titive use of language. Cedillo T r. at 1603-04. b. Impaired Social Int eractio n Dom ain. There are four su bgroups within t he impaired social int eractio n domain: (1) marked im pairm ent in th e use of multiple nonverbal beh aviors; (2) f ailure t o develop peer relation ships a ppropriate to the child's d evelopm ental level; (3) m arked impairme nt in expression of plea sure in the happiness o f others; a nd (4) lack of social o r emotion al reciprocity. Nonverbal b ehaviors includ e gestu res, e ye contact, and use and understan ding of body language. T he subgroup of peer relatio nship s take s into consid eratio n a child's co gnitiv e impairm ent, and loo ks to the nature of relatio nship s appropriate for the level of developmental function, rathe r than calendar age. The third subgroup is esse ntially a de ficiency in em pathy. T he last su bgroup, social re ciprocity, include s respo nding to con tact from others, a s well as in itiation of social o r emotion al contact. Cedillo T r. at 1594-96. Socia l young childre n inclu de poor eye contact, lack of social sm iling, poor resp onse to the child's o wn name, and reduced facial e xpression s. Ced illo T r. at 1269A-70 A. The greatest im pairm ents in so cializ ation are in those children who are so cially unavailable . They rema in ob livious t o their surroun dings, do not see k con solatio n when injured , and may wander aim lessly . Social u navailability man ifests a t around 18 months to two years of age. Cedillo T r. at 1597-98. Spontaneous play is ev aluated at the level of the child's m ental an d emotiona l functioning. A utistic ch ildren m ay play in a rep etitive ma nner or fail to initiate play at a ll. 57Cedillo T r. at 1604-05. Socially r emote children do not initiat e social inte raction with an adult. They ma y respo nd if an adult initia tes co ntact, but will not see k to continue the contact if the adult breaks a way. T hese children look at their p eers, but do not approach them, and often choose to play alone. Ced illo T r. at 1598-99. Othe r autistic children , esp ecially older on es, m ay engage in so cially inappropriate in teract ion, particu larly with th ers. ch ildren with no rmal intelligence may displa y cial skills, but their beh avior is mech anica l and scripted and interaction may be f ocuse d on their own narrow range of interests o r on learne d respo nses. To illustrat e a learn ed respo nse, Dr. W iznitzer described a ch ild who could not answer a question about where he lived, but cou ld an swer correctly w hen aske d for his ad dress. Cedillo T r. at 1599-1602. c. Rest ricted, Repe titive, and Stereotyped Behavior Doma in. The third d iagnostic criterion requires tha t the child displa y restricted , repetitive, and stere otyped patterns of behavior f alling in at least one of four su bcategories: (1) a n abnorma lly restricted pattern of interest; (2) a n adherence to specif ic (and non- functional) routine s or preoccu pation with pa rts of objects. Cedillo T r. at 1612-16. The restricted patterns of interest criterion , the first in th is subgroup , is an inten se preoccu pation with na rrow, restricted subjects, ra nging fro m watching fan blades tu rn to an overw helm ing interest in a carto on chara cter, a card game , or a n area of natural h istory . Ced illo T r. at 1613-14. A ild m ight w atch a ce iling fa n for a few second s, bu t an autistic child m ight spen d thirty minute s lookin g at th e fan and would be angry at attempts to redirect his inte rest.

It is the fact o f the restricted interest, n ot the subje ct matter of the interest, that is im porta nt for the diagnosis. Ce dillo T r. at 1593A. An autistic child m ight repetitively turn a light on and off for a lengthy period of time; in contrast, a typically developin g child m ight do so for a few minut es before m oving on to another interest . Cedillo T r. at 1616. The secon d subgroup, an adherence to routine s, is an apparent desire f or sameness: th e same seat at the dinn er table, taking th e same route to a location , or expecting the sam e greetin g ritual.

The fourth subgroup involv es a focus on individual com ponents of an object, rathe r than the object itself. For example , an autistic child m ight not be interested in playing w ith a toy car; inst ead he might f ocus on making the wheels spin. Cedillo T r. at 1615-16. 3. Diagnostic T ools. Specializ ed checklists a nd interview instrum ents are used to evaluate children for AS D. T he Childho od Autism Ra ting Scale [\"CARS\"] ha s been used for many y ears. More rece nt rating sy stem s includ e the Autism Diagnostic In terview-Revised [\"ADI-R\"] and the Autism Diagnostic Ob servation al Sch edule-Gen eric [\"ADOS-G\"]. The ADI-R is an interview of the caregiv er; th e ADOS-G is use d in direct e xaminatio n of the child. These two instrum ents are used togeth er. Ce dillo T r. at 1272A-74 A. These standardized tests allow fo r a high degree o f agreem ent among clinicians in the diagnosis o f ASD. Cedillo T r. at 1274A. Altho ugh m ost a utism specialists use one or more of the checklists in m aking a diagnosis, they also use home videos t o observe be haviors tha t a child m ay not manifest in the clinic. Hom e videos o f babies a t age 1 0-12 months have proven extremely usef ul in id entifying autistic ch ildren e arly in life. Several stu dies h ave109 established that a traine d observer can d istinguish childre n with aut ism f rom those with mental retarda tion (of a type not iden tifiable by fa cial cha racteristics) an d from children with typical de velopment. The prima ry features d istinguishing aut istic children from their men tally r etarded or typically developing pee rs are a bnormal gaze or e ye contact, deficits in joint attention, and lack o f orien tation to their nam e. The single best pred ictor of an eventu al au tism diagnosis is a baby's fa ilure to look at people tryi ng to in teract with him. Cedillo T r. at 1296A-99 A. Hom e videos, altho ugh use ful as diagnost ic too ls, are n ot used as th e sole ba sis of a diagnosis of ASD. Cedillo T r. at 1699-1700. Video analysis don e with children younger tha n 12 months ca n over-diagnose autism, but even th e children im properly diagno sed with autism may have oth er de velopmental issues. Cedillo T r. at 1724-25. Several o f these stu dies a re discu ssed in more d epth below. The precise onse t of the disea se of autism is difficult to determine. The first Several of the pediatric neurologists testified that they used home videos in their diagnosis of109 children with autism. Cedillo Tr. at 1295A-99A,1643-45, and 1756-59. Interestingly, Dr. Kinsbourne's first foray into the use of home videos to detect symptoms of autism was in Michelle Cedillo's case. He testified that he observed no signs of autism in Michelle Cedillo's videos taken prior to her MMR vaccination. Cedillo Tr. at 1064-66A, 1171. Other experts who viewed the videos pointed out specific portions of the videos that demonstrated early onset or classic symptoms of autism in Michelle months prior to her MMR vaccination. Cedillo Tr. at 1338A-54. 59symptoms are often observed before 2 4 months of age. However, recognition of these symptoms does not necessa rily indica te the beginnin g of the disea se process. To analogize to lung can cer, th e first recogniz ed symptom might be coughing blood , but by that point, the cancer h as been in th e lun gs fo r many mon ths to years. Ce dillo T r. at 1283-84. With autism , som e parents ha ve rep orted that their child a ppeared to be developin g norma lly, but at age 1 2-24 months, they began noting prob lems in lan guage developm ent, as compared to other children of similar a ge. T hirty percent of parents recogniz e some developmental prob lem by the child's f irst birthda y; the child's seco nd birthd ay. T he mean age of first paren tal co ncern about the child's developm ent is ap proximate ly 14-19 m onths. T r. at 1285A-86 A. D. Se parate Phenotypes? Doctor Fo mbonne testified that the epidem iology of autism is com plicate d by the various classif ication s use d, su ch as classic au tism, early onset a utism , and regressiv e autism. Cedillo T r. at 2596-97. It is no t only the epidem iology that is com plicate d by these Petitione trigg ering onse t of autism in a group of children with a separate phenotype of the disord er. Fo r a110 number o f reaso ns, their th eory requir es th at regressive autism be a se parate phenotype. Some of those rea sons are b ased on the nature of the hypoth eses develope d. The temporal conn ection between MMR v accina tion and loss o f skills w as cited by Dr . Kinsbou rne a s evidence of a ca usal m echa nism occu rring shortly before the time of loss. Skill loss is of ten noted at around 18 months of age, sh ortly after administration of the MMR v accine at 12-15 months, thus making the MMR v accine a111 possib le can didate as a ca use. Oth er reaso ns for the focus on regressiv e autism are more pract ical. B ecau se th e first sy mptoms of autism often prece de administration of the MMR v accine , it would b e illogical to a scribe MMR causa tion to these case s. 112 Thus, an MMR theo ry of causation requires tha t regressiv e autism be considered a sepa rate disorde r, with a cause or cause s distinct from the causes o f early onset o r classic au tism. If regressiv e autism is no t a sepa rate phenotype, then it is m ore likely Phenotype, as used in this context means: \"the entire physical, biochemical and physiological110 makeup of an individual as determined both genetically and environmentally...\". DORLAND'S at 1421. As used in the context of petitioners' theory, the phenotype of regressive autism (or regressive autistic enterocolitis) refers to a postulated \"separate type\" of autism with distinct features and causes separate from classic or early onset autistic disorders. Hazlehurst Tr. at 662A-64. The enterocolitis aspect of this theory is discussed in Section VI., Parts A.1.b and A.2.a. Since 1998, the Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices has recommended111 administration of the first dose of the MMR vaccine at 12-15 months of age. See MMWR, CDC; 55(22): 629-30 (2006). Prior to 1998, the recommendation was that the vaccine be administered at 15 months. See MMWR, CDC; 47(8):1-57 (1998). Doctor Kinsbourne would not opine in favor of causation if symptoms of autism preceded the112 MMR vaccination. Snyder Tr. at 536A-37A. 60that regressiv e autism and classic a utism share a set o f com mon causes. This sect ion e xamines t he evidence for regressiv e autism constitutin g a sep arate phenotype of autistic disord er. T hereafter, I consider what is kn own abo ut the cause s of autism in gene ral. Fina lly, I return to regressive autism in particular to see if it is sufficiently dif ferent from classic or e arly onset a utistic d isorders, so as to ren der a sepa rate cause for regressiv e autism likely or probable. Based on what is kno wn about autism's stron g genetic ba sis, atal nature o f significa nt ch anges in the pathophysiology of autistic brain s, an d the epidemiologic ev idence, I conclude that there is insu fficient e vidence to show that regressiv e autism is a se parate phenotype. 1. Possib le Ph enotypes of Autistic Disorder a nd PDD-NOS. As th e wide range o f behavioral ma nifestations discusse d in Part C, above, suggests, the re is con siderab le variability in th e presen ting sy mptoms of ASD. Children with autistic d isorder o r PDD-NOS share similarities a nd display their \"classic\" \" How ever, accordin g to Dr. Kinsb ourne, the age a t which sy mptoms of autism manifest, and the nature of the sympto ms themselves, su ggest that autistic disord ers m ay be d ivided into several ph enotypes: (1) early onset or co ngenita l cases, in which children fail to reach developmental milest ones and display some characteristic sympto ms of autism in the first six months of life; (2) classic au tism, in which ea rly development is n orma l or ne ar no rmal, until the first recogniz ed symptoms of autism manifest, usua lly at ten to fifteen months of life; and (3) regressiv e autism , in which pre viously acquired skills are lost , usu ally during the secon d year of life. Cedillo T r. at 1054-55. Some of the resea rch con ducted into autism lo oks a t early or classic a utism as one cate gory and regressiv e autism as a separate cate gory. Much early resea rch w as criticiz ed beca use it did not distinguish between children with regressiv e autism and those with classic or e arly onset o f sympto ms. Therefore, many researche rs ensu re a wider a ccept ance of their research by collecting dat a based on the nature of the onset of the disord er. T his cat egoriz ation should n ot be rea d to suggest tha t the rese arche rs consid er them to be two separate disorders. a. Early Onset a nd Classic Aut istic Disorders. Some children with diagnoses on the autism spect rum demonstrate \"early onse t,\" in which ab norm alities in developm ent appear at a round six mon ths, when the child d oes not babble, does not respon d to caregiv ers, a nd does not make eye contact. The secon d group com prises th e majority of children with an ASD113 diagnosis. This group of children seems to develop n orma lly up to a certain p oint, but at 12-14 months, they have a progressiv e deviation o f their developm ent from the 113 Doctor Rust testified that children diagnosed with autism during the first year of life are often classified as having congenital or classic autism.

Regressiv e or Loss of Skills Aut istic Disorders. Some autistic ch ildren e xperien ce a loss o f previously acquired skills and are frequent ly referred t o as having regr essive autism . These children may have had apparently normal d evelopm ent prior to the loss o f skills, but in about 70% of them, there was so me earlier abno rmality in de velopment. Cedillo T r. at 1289A. 2. Regressiv e Autism as a Distinct Disorde r? If the loss o f skills (reg ressed ) group and the early onset group are truly distinct phenotypes, then it is p ossible that there a re dif ferent cau sal m echa nism s for ea ch type. Or, as Dr. Kin sbou rne a sserted , regression in dicate s tha t \"som ething\" is happening to th e brain a t the point when the regression m anifests, with his imp lication being that the MMR v accine is the postulat ed triggering event. Cedillo T r. at 1055. Doctor K insbo urne contended that there m ust b e an explanation for why developm ent in a norm al or n early norma l child ta kes a sudden downward trajecto ry. He argued that \"some thing m ust h ave mo st likely happ ened to change th e trajectory of development in such a rad ical w ay.\" Snyder T r. at 479A-80A . He testif ied that what causes a utistic regression is \"no t only not kno wn, it's h ardly been investigated.\" Snyder T r. at 480A. Altho ugh th ere is st ill deba te about the percen tage o f children with autistic disorde rs who manifest with loss o f skills, mo st au tism experts acce pt that skill loss does occu r. That such skill losses o ccur in a utistic d isorders sh ould not be surprising, beca use other con dition s on the autism spect rum manifest with skill losses a t spe cific time frame s. Childre n with childho od disinte grative disorde r experience a drama tic loss of acquired skills at th ree years of age o r later, a nd girls with Ret t's disord er also experience several pe riods o f skill loss, involv ing both langua ge and motor skills. Th e loss of skills also o ccurs in ch ildren with the PDD-NOS dia gnosis in n umbers sim ilar to those with an autistic disorde r diagnosis; in bo th ca ses, t he skills loss generally occurs before the age of two. Cedillo T r. at 1289A-90 A. 62a. Proble ms in Docu menting Skill Lo ss. Docum entation of the nature and extent of skill loss in ch ildren with au tistic disorde r or PDD-NOS is com plicate d by the retrosp ective nat ure o f case asce rtainm ent in most st udies, con cerns a bout possible rep orting bias in pa renta l obse rvation s, an d the lack o f a standard m easu reme nt for regression. There is genera l agreem ent that some children with au tistic disord ers experience a loss of previously acquired skills, usua lly at 15-24 months of age. Loss of langua ge skills is most frequent ly observed,114 but skill loss m ay also occu r in no nverbal area s of development. What percenta ge of autistic children fall in th e regressiv e or loss of skills category is dif ficult to determine, with estima tes ra nging fro m 5 to 50%. This wi de range u ndoubtedly stem s from the115 use of different criteria in classif ying children. The range o f estim ates may be a ffected by recall bias, as parental int erviews, con ducted months or years af ter th e onset of symptoms, were of ten the only method available to investigators to classif y children as having ex perien cing regr ession . Few of the earlier studies sepa rated children with116 regression f rom those without. Ced illo T r. at 1055-56A. b. Use of Hom e Videos in Docu menting Dif ferences.

It is not uncommon for parents to describe a loss of language in their children. However, in at116 least some of these cases, the children were not using language independently, merely imitatively. That is, the child repeated what the parent said, and the parent interpreted that as the use of a word. This is not a true loss of language, and the child's later lack of repetition does not represent autistic regression. Cedillo Tr. at 1668-70; Hazlehurst 460A-61A. Cedillo Res. Ex. P, Tab 155. 117 J.

Snyder T r. at 729A. I thus co nclud e that petition ers ha ve failed to demonstrate that regressiv e autism is a se parate phenotype o f ASD. The weight of the evidence is tha t som e children with ASD d evelop sympt oms by six months, o thers at 1 0 to 12 months, o thers at 1 8 months, and still oth ers at three to four years of age. The \"first\" sy mptoms do not define the disorde r; the y simp ly indica te when the disord er manifests.

Postnatally, autistic features have developed in previously normal children in the course of an acute encephalopathic illness. In two reported cases, the illnesses subsided and the autistic features disappeared.

Genetic B asis. At the outset, it is imp ortan t to understa nd the distinct ion b etween in herite d genetic co nditio ns and those th at arise de novo . Autism has features o f both types of genetic d isorders. The simp lest f orm of an inhe rited co nditio n is o ne which o ccurs w hen the child inherits a d ominant gene from one parent. Hun tington's ch orea this m anner.

Du ring concep tion or ea rly gestatio n, defects o r mutations in genes o r chrom osom es m ay arise, w ith or withou t a known cause . For example , Down's sy ndrome is a gen etic co nditio n, but not one which is131 inherited. It occurs de novo , cau sed by an e xtra co py of half of chrom osom e 21. If a cond ition is in herite d, theoretically at least, the parents can be teste d for it, a s can the child. If the condition arises de novo, only genet ic testin g of the child ca n reveal th e defect. Cedillo T r. at 1504-05. In Down's sy ndrome, testing of the parents would provide no indictio n that a fetus has the condition . Before b irth, te sting the fetus is the only me thod to determine if the genet ic def ect is p resen t. Thus far, th e examples o f genet ics have be en simp le on es.

The distinction between \"behavioral symptoms meeting the DSM-IV-TR diagnostic criteria\" and being diagnosed with an ASD is a significant one. Because autism is a diagnosis of exclusion, a child with Fragile X syndrome who meets the diagnostic criteria for autism should not be given an autism diagnosis. Cedillo Tr. at 1485A. \"Concordance rate\" refers to the percentage of the time that two individuals or groups share134 the same condition. A 100% concordance rate indicates that the condition is completely controlled by genes.

Doct or W ard's te stimo ny was ca sone d, and well-supp o wn experien ce. For ba sic conce pts n ot otherwise explaine d by the e xperts, I relied upon How the Immune Syste m Works by Lau ren S ompayrac (2d ed., Blackwell Pu blishing) (2003 ). There do not appear to b e any genuine issu es of fact in this section before rea ching the issue of imm une system \"skewing\" in Part A. 2.c.(3 ), below. The human immune respo nse to pathogens is m ounted by the innate and adaptive imm une systems. These two sy stem s fight pat hogen s in d ifferent and complem entary ways. Like t he Army and Air Force, they bring dif ferent types o f com bat power to t he battle, a nd they each function o ptimally when they com municate well. T he innate im mune system is the first respon der. When the inna te im mune system calls f or help, the adaptive immune system is activated and deployed, takin g abou t four to seven days bef ore it enters th e battle. Ced illo T r. at 689A-90B . The components of the two sy stem s are a veritable alphabet sou p of cell types, recep tors, a nd signaling mech anism s. Fo r that reason, Appendix A to t his op inion contains a glossary of term s. 1. Innate Immune System. The innate im mune system provides a rapid , but non-spe cific, respo nse to the prese nce of pathogens. I n additio n to natural b arriers to in fection , includ ing skin an d mucous, the inna te im mune system relies o n specialized w hite blood cells, called phagocy tes, complem ent proteins (which w ere d iscussed only in passing in th e testim ony and exhibits), de ndritic ce lls [\"DC\" ], and natural killer [\"NK\"] cells (a t ype of lymphocyte) to act as th e body's initial de fense against invaders. 691, Ce dillo Ex. R at 2 . The innate im mune system also produces 77cytokine s, and is largely respo nsible for inf lammation and fever. Cedillo T r. at 691,146 2772A.

Phagocy tes. Phagocy tes a re cells th at engulf or ingest microo rganism s or p articles in a proce ss called \"pha gocy tosis.\" T hey a nd neutroph ils. In tissue, macroph ages act like vacuum clean ers, clea ning up cellular d ebris. When they encoun ter an invading pa thogen, th ey engulf or ingest it, bre aking it up into peptides. Snyder T r. at 575A. In the proce ss, th ey cytokine s alert o ther macroph ages th at an invade r is presen t. Ma croph ages th at receive such signals are sa id to be \"activated\" o r \"primed .\" On ce activated, they can function a s antigen prese nting cells [\"AP Cs\"] tha t com municate the nature of the invading pat hogen to the adaptive imm une system. One cytokine kn to roduced by helpe r T cells an d NK cells. Ced illo Res. E x. R at 2. Macroph ages can become hyperactivated by direct signals f rom invading pathogen s, such as lipo duce the own as tu mor necrosis f actor [\"TNF\"], which can kill tum or cells a nd virus-inf ected cells, and can activate o ther com ponents of the immune system. The release of cytokines p roduces inf lammation. Neutro phils m ake up about 70% o f the white blood cells in circulation . They Cytokines are hormone-like proteins that communicate between immune system cells. In146 essence, they are messages or orders sent from one cell to another. Some act locally; others act over distances. Some cytokines are classed as interleukins [\"IL\"]; the different types of interleukins are assigned numbers to distinguish them. Interleukins that are assigned low numbers (i.e., IL-1 and IL-2) and some other cytokines, such as tumor necrosis factor [\"TNF\"], that are assigned no number, are produced in very large quantities in the body and are not well regulated. These are produced quickly and elicit proinflammatory responses. For instance, IL-1 produces a high fever when injected. Cedillo Tr. at 1813A-15. The more recently discovered cytokines, generally the ones assigned higher numbers, are more tightly regulated, do more specific things within the body, and are produced in much smaller quantities. Cedillo Tr. at 917-18, 1812A-13A, 2235A-39. Cytokines can be classified several different ways: as proinflammatory and anti-inflammatory or as those that act over short distances or over long distances. Most act over only short distances, particularly those that are responsible for activating cellular responses. Cedillo Tr. at 2236. Those that act over long distances tend to be more proinflammatory, such as IL-1. Cedillo Tr. at 1897-98, 2237-39. Cytokines are involved in all immune responses. They are also used in the central nervous system [\"CNS\"] to communicate between leukocytes and glial cells. Cedillo Tr. at 2236-37. Lipopolysaccharides are molecules contained in the cell walls of many bacteria.

Dend ritic cells are p robably the m ost im porta nt cla ss of APCs. They are lo cated at places where p athogens m ay inv ade the body, including th e skin, the lining of the lungs an d gut, and in th e liver. In t heir restin g state, they act as phagocytes, e ngulf ing and digesting inf ected cells and viruses. Cedillo Re s. Ex. R at 2. However, w hen toll- like recep tors [\"T LR\"] on the surface of dendritic ce lls recogniz e LPS o r cytokine s (such as TNF) that indicat e a pathogenic invasion, t hey beco me activated . Upo n activation , they travel f rom the tissue through th e lymph atic system to nearby lymph nodes. They display ant igens, f ragmen ts of proteins f rom viruses o r other pa rasites, on their cell surfaces, and activate T cells in t he lymph nodes. Ced illo T r. at 692-97A, 906B-09 A, 2231A-33 A; Ce Res. Tr. Ex. 16, at 11. APCs a ssist the adaptive immune system to recogniz e and respo nd to invading path ogens. Cedillo T r. at 696-97A. b. Natura l Killer Cells. Natura l killer cells, as t heir n ame implies, a re versatile killers, cap able of killing tumor cells, virus inf ected cells, bact eria, p arasite s, an d fungi. T hey kill cells by \"injecting\" them with co mpounds th at trigger cell dea th or by binding to the surface of the target a nd send ing chem ical signals tha t induce cell de ath. Like m acrop hages, they are m ore e ffective killers w hen activated by chem icals such as L PS o r when they receive interf eron cells atta cked by viruses. c. Resp onse to Viruses. Viruses re produce by hijacking a cell's m achin ery to produce more cop ies of the virus. T hose copies exit the cells an d infect n eighboring cells. When viruses a re in transit between cells, th e inn ate imm une system ca n reco gnize and destroy them, but the inna te im mune system is m uch less ef fective against viruses inside cells. T he innate im mune system is excellent, howev er, at signaling the adaptive immune system about the viral inv asion . Ced illo T r. at 2231A-33A. 2. The Adaptive Im mune System. As its n ame implies, t he adaptive imm une system ca n adapt to fight alm ost a ny invading path ogen. Although it requires time to recogniz e a new invader, a nd to recruit and equip t he army to f ight it, on ce it e ncou nters and defeats a sp ecific pat hogen , it ca n respo nd quickly to future invasions. Because the cells th at were m ost e ffective against the pathogen be come part of the adaptive immune system 's me mory, the adaptive immune system ca n mount a more rapid and tailored resp onse to subse quent attacks. Apoptosis is programmed cell death. DORLAND'S at 117. In essence, the cell has a natural148 lifespan, at the end of which it self-destructs. 79The prima ry com ponents of the adaptive immune system are B and T lymphocytes. B cells m ature in t he bone marrow ; T cells m ature in t he thymus. Ced illo Res. E x. R at 2. Once mature, both B and T cells en ter th e blood strea m and circulate between the circulatory and lymphatic system s. Like the inna te im mune system , the adaptive immune system also uses cytokine s to communicate and mount a respo nse. Ced illo T r. at 692.

Although Dr. Kennedy testified that the measles vaccine virus can cause immune suppression156 or immunodeficiency, his statement was challenged by several other witnesses with greater expertise regarding measles virus. Cedillo Tr. at 710, 1887A. I address the issue of the immunosuppressive effects of measles virus elsewhere in this opinion. During the testimony in Snyder, it became apparent that much of Dr. Kennedy's testimony157 about the measles virus came from Dr. Griffin's chapter in Field's Virology. See Snyder Tr. at 1000-04A. However, he relied upon an outdated version of that reference. Snyder Tr. at 1004A. In surrebuttal, Dr. Rima noted that information known to be outdated or incorrect by those in the field of measles virology may appear in textbooks. Snyder Tr. at 1007A-08A. This is more likely when the textbook in question has been superceded by a new edition. Between six months and two to three years of age, the average child has six to 10 infections158 per year. Hazlehurst Tr. at 568A. 86(2) T ypes of Testing.

Immune system function ca n be measu red two way s. Th1 respo nse (the cell-med iated arm of the imm une system) is m easu red b y the in vitro react ion o f the cells to a stimulus. T h2 respo nse (the humoral a rm of the imm une system) is m easu red b y determining how well the B and T cells com municate . If antibod ies are prod uced to a stimu lation with an agent to which t he child h as been exposed , then that arm of the immune system is working. Te sting imm une respo nse to particular p athogens, such as those found in vaccine s, is a better m easu re of whether the child's im mune system is functional, because an antibod y respo nse demonstrates that the T cells can recognize the pathogen, a nd that they can te ll the B cells to p roduce antibo dies t o the antigens prese nt.

Mitogens are substances that cause lymphocytes to proliferate. DORLAND'S at 1162. By comparing responses to common antigens (ones to which a substantial portion of the population has been exposed), it is possible to determine if the individual's immune system is responding properly. Negative responses to common antigens suggest that the immune system is abnormal. Cedillo weed, used b ecau se th ey are kno wn to activate n orma l T and B cells to divide.

Cedillo Tr. at 995. Both Dr. Ward and Dr. McCusker disagreed with this statement. Cedillo Tr. at 1799-1800A; 2211. Considering their relative qualifications, and the support found for their testimony in other exhibits (see, e.g., A.

Petitione rs' primary w itness on mercury and its e ffects was Dr. Apo shian , a toxicologist. Resp ondent countered Dr. A posh ian's te stimo ny with th at of Dr. Bren t, a168 medical to xicologist. Docto r Byers' testimony abou t mercury' s effects o n the immune system was not drawn from her e xpert report, he r pub lications, or her pe rsona l resea rch. I t appeared that she drew her un dersta nding of mercury' s effects f rom several scientif ic journa l articles th at sh e had read. In co ntrast to the testimony of both of petitione rs' witnesse s, Dr. Bren t offered clear a nd focuse d testimo ny during bot h direct an d cross-exam inatio n. His testim ony was based on his e xperien ce in diagnosin g and treating me rcury poisoning, nd was supp orted by the medical litera ture filed. Doctor McCab e, an immunotoxicologi st, was eminently qualif ied to opine on both mercury in general a nd its ef fects o n the immune system in particular.

Cedillo Tr. 776-783. He did not testify directly about thimerosal or ethylmercury's effects. I have thus accorded his opinion on this topic little weight.

This widely cited article reported the effects of oral ingestion and prenatal exposure to methylmercury as the result of eating bread made from seed grain treated with methylmercury. Central nervous system damage, characterized by loss of sensation in hands and feet, paresthesia around the mouth, ataxia, slurred speech, diminution of vision, and loss of hearing, were common symptoms, with extremity numbness and paresthesia as the first symptoms noted. Severe poisoning resulted in blindness, coma, and death. Prenatal exposure resulted in mental retardation with cerebral palsy. Those infants prenatally exposed had higher concentrations of methylmercury in their blood than did their mothers. Onset of parasthesia occurred, on average, at 40 mg of exposure, although parathesia occurred at doses as low as 25 mg of methylmercury. Threshold doses for ataxia, dysarthria, deafness, and death were 55, 90, 170, and 200 mg of Hg, respectively. Of note, the abbreviation \"mg\" represents milligrams, or one-thousandth of a gram, as compared to \"\u00ecg\" which represents a microgram, or one millionth of a gram. See Neil M.

Onset of symptoms began between 7-15 days after ingestion. The symptoms observed in over 10% of the patients were (in order of most frequent symptom): weakness, loss of appetite, dizziness, nausea, abdominal pain and diarrhea, fever, numbness of extremities, paresthesia, ataxia, vomiting, thirst, unsteady gait, headache, insomnia, fatigue and sleepiness, heart palpitation, inability to walk, polyuria, and chest pain. Those hospitalized had weakness, loss of appetite, nausea and vomiting, dizziness, speech disturbance, incapability of standing, abdominal pain and diarrhea, and tinnitus. The signs displayed by more than 20% of those hospitalized included muscular weakness, fever, unsteady gait, decreased tendon reflexes, emaciation, hepatomegaly, listlessness, impaired speech, paralysis in lower extremities, increased tendon reflexes, and coma. Mild cases were estimated to have ingested 0.5-1.0 mg/kg body weight; moderate severe cases at 2.0-3.0 mg/kg body weight and the one lethal case at 4.0 mg/kg body weight. Doctor Brent testified that these patients had ingested between 35,000 and 280,000 \u00b5g of ethylmercury. 91Cedillo P et. Ex. 55, Tab G, at 12. Mercury read ily forms compounds with other subst ance s. The various mercury compounds and elem ental mercury are of ten referred t o as \"specie s\" of mercury. Elem ental mercury and its non-carbon ining com pounds are cla ssified a s inorganic m ercury. Mercury com pounds containing carb on are cla ssed as organic forms of mercury. Elem ental mercury is fo und in air and dental amalgams. Inorganic mercury can be found in air, w ater, and food, in the form of mercury v apor or m ercury salts. Organic me rcury includ es m ethylmercury (found primarily in fish) an d ethylmercury . Ced illo T r. at 2343-44. Ethylmercury from TCVs is th e primary source o f ethylmercury exposure . Breast milk co ntains m ercury from the mother's de ntal amalgams, ingested mercury from water and food, and from the mother's exposure to TCVs an d other mercury -conta ining me dical p roducts. Once in the body, elem ental an d organic m ercury comp ounds are metabolized. S ome of the mercury is excreted, primarily in feces and urine , and some is con verted to mercuric me rcury (inorganic m ercury) , which bind s to body tissue s and is th us less readily excreted than organic m ercury. Thimerosa l, the form of mercury fo und in vaccines, has been used extensively in pharmace utical p roducts since the 1920s. Alth ough it was rem oved f rom most173 vaccine s by 200 1, it continues to be used as a n antimicrobial in multidose vials of som e vaccine s. IO M 200 4 Rep ort, Ce dillo Res. Ex. JJ, at 36-37.

Cedillo Res. Tr. Ex. 18, 47 F.R. 436 (1982) (notice of proposed rulemaking regarding banning174 the use of mercury-containing over-the-counter drug products) and Cedillo Res. Tr. Ex. 19, 21 C.F.R. \u00a7 310.545 (April 11, 2007). The 1982 FDA action was an assessment of the safety and efficacy of thimerosal-containing disinfectants such as merthiolate for use on wounds. The assessment was performed because of concerns that overdosing could occur, that thimerosal was not effective in wounds containing pus, and that there was a potential for allergic reactions. The 2007 FDA action involved a listing of some 700 drug products sold over the counter for which there was inadequate data to establish their safety and effectiveness. The list, organized by the use to which the product was commonly put, included camphor, aspirin, Vitamin E, zinc oxide, menthol, peppermint oil, garlic, and thimerosal. Thimerosal's inclusion on the list had nothing to do with its use as a preservative in vaccines. 92b. Toxicokinetics. Generally speaking, th e different spe cies of mercury have dif ferent toxicological properties. Mercury is the metal with th e most d iverse e ffects a mong its dif ferent by petitio ners o n the harmful effects o f mercury inv olved stud ies an d rep orts dealing w ith exposu re to methylmercury , not the ethylmercury fo und in th imerosal.

Their e fforts to do so were no t entirely successf ul. A lthou gh the re are similarities b etween t he two species o f mercury and their effects, the differences a re signif icant. In asse ssing ethylmercury's ef fects o n the immune and central n ervous system s, I re lied u pon the amply suppo rted testim ony tha t it is no t scien tifically valid to u se th e toxicological prop erties o f methylmercury to determin e the effects o f similar d oses of ethylmercury .

Ced T r. at 2330, 2470-71. The179 half-life of methylmercury in primate s was 25 days, mo re than three times lon ger. 180 The Burba cher st udy also e xamined the amount of each sp ecies o f mercury that entered the brain , finding th at about three times more methylmercury did so. Of the amounts of each sp ecies t hat entered the brain , ethylmercury was elimina ted nearly twice as fast a s methylmercury . Howev er, a higher p ercen tage o f the ethylmercury that entered the brain was co nverted t here to inorganic m ercury than that of methylmercury . Once converted to inorganic m ercury from either sou rce, it was elimin ated very slowl y. Cedillo T r. at 2471-74; Ced illo Res. E x. L at 13. The authors o f the Burbach er stu dy conclu ded that methylmercury is \"not a su itable reference for risk assessm ent from exposure to thimerosa l.\" Othe r stud ies ha ve methylmercury have af finities for dif ferent ans, with ethylmercury targeting both the kidne ys and the brain and methylmercury specifically targeting th e brain. Different amounts of each sp ecies are required to produce mercury intoxication . The Burba cher st udy dem onstrated that more ethyl than methylmercury is required to prod uce the sam e effect. The 1985 Magos stud y, filed a s Cedillo P et. Ex. 55, Tab FF, had sim ilar results. More181 ethylmercury than methylmercury was required to produce a given amount of damage to the brain in rats. Ced illo T r. at 2489-90. On ly rats e xpose d to methylmercury had widesp read granular layer da mage in th e cerebellum, indica ting tha t organic m ercury The compressed period of administration, as compared to the vaccination schedule for human177 infants, did not permit the same amount of excretion of mercury between doses. Thus, the results are not directly comparable to the levels of mercury that could be expected in human infants, even assuming that human infants metabolize mercury in the same manner as primate infants. Id. at 1015. \"Half-life\" (sometimes called \"half-time\") refers to the period of time for half of a given amount178 of a substance to be eliminated from the body. DORLAND'S at 810. A research team examining the clearance rate of ethylmercury in human infants receiving179 TCVs found a seven day half-life for ethylmercury. See M.

(2) Ref erence Dose [\"RfD\"]. Both Dr. Ap oshia n and Dr. Brent agreed on the concept and definition of the term \"reference dose.\" The term is use d by the Environm ental Prot ection Agency [\"EPA\"] to mean the daily dose of a su bstance, as a veraged over a lif etime, that would not be expecte d to have an adverse ef fect. The most im porta nt co ncep t regarding reference dose is tha t it rep resen ts an average over a lif etime. On so me days, the reference dose might b e exceed ed, while, o n others, the reference dose would not be reach ed. Ced illo T r. at 66-66B, 85A, 2346-47. The reference dose does not reflect th e point at which t oxicity will occur. Ce dillo T r. at 2348-50. The EPA RfD is 0.1 \u00ecg of methylmercury per kilogr am per day. Ced illo T r. at185 84A. The reference dose is subst ance specific; th ere is n o established reference dose for eith er ethylmercury or th imerosal. Cedillo T r. at 2347. The reference dose for m ethylmercury was established base d on data obtaine d The symbol \"\u00ecg\" was routinely used in exhibits as an abbreviation for \"microgram\" (sometimes185 abbreviated as \"mcg\"), meaning one millionth of a gram. It should not be confused with the abbreviation \"mg\" or milligram, which represents one-thousandth of a gram. See MED. ABBREV. at 394. 96from victims o f the mercury- contaminate d seed wheat disa ster in Iraq. The data were186 later ref ined by the Faroe Island s stud y.

There is no scient ific basis f or ap plying the reference dose from methylmercury to doses of thim erosa l. Ced illo T r. at 2347. Even if there were, Dr. Apo shian misa pplied the reference dose conce pt during his te stimo ny in Cedillo . He testif ied that when Michelle Ce dillo was one day old, she weighed approximately 3.6 kilogram s and received a dose of 12.5 \u00ecg of mercury from her first hep atitis B vaccination , which amounted to 3.5 \u00ecg of mercury per kilogram. Cedillo T r. at 85A. This was correct. O n that date, the amount of ethylmercury she received e xceed ed the reference dose for methylmercury. How ever, Dr. Apo shian misapp lied th e reference dose conce pt when he state d that Miche lle received it \"pe r day\" and that she therefore rece ived 35 times the EPA RfD. In fact, she received a bolus dose on that day (and o n the dates of188 several oth er vaccination s), no t \"per day.\" T here is no RfD esta blished for ethylmercury ; the EPA Rf D is f or m ethylmercury . Assum ing Michelle gained no weight and ingested no mercury from other sou rces, h er cum ulative exposure in one month would be roughly that of the RfD for m ethylmercury .

In terms of the adverse effects observed, the Faroe Islands study found very subtle, subclinical deficits in memory and language in children who were otherwise normal. Cedillo Tr. at 2348-50. This was not simply a misstatement by Dr. Aposhian. He resisted efforts during cross-188 examination to have him quantify the level of ethylmercury from TCVs in Michelle at any one time, and ignored the elimination process for mercury. Cedillo Tr. at 195-97. \"Hypersusceptible\" was not defined by Dr. Aposhian. According to Dr. Brent, hypersusceptible189 individuals manifest toxic responses to a dose of an agent that does not produce any response in the general population. Cedillo Tr. at 2481. \"Efflux\" refers to molecules leaving the body. In this context, it refers to an inability to excrete190 mercury.

This literature survey examined twelve studies of the relationship of thimerosal to autism, and concluded that there is no reliable evidence of a link between TCVs and autism, and that the pharmacodynamics of ethylmercury make such an association unlikely.

Although Dr. Aposhian's report cited to an article by S. Bernard, et al., (Autism: A novel form of193 mercury poisoning, MED. HYPOTHESES 56(4) 462-71 (2001), filed as Cedillo Res. Ex. L, Tab 10) that contended the symptoms of acrodynia and mercury poisoning were similar, a comparison of the primary symptoms of autism and those of acrodynia clearly indicates that the two conditions are not similar. Doctor Brent's report (Cedillo Res. Ex. L at 4-5) called this article's premise \"wholly insupportable.\" See also Nelson and Bauman, Cedillo Pet. Ex. L, Tab 43. J. Warkeny and D.

This article was often cited as the source of the 1-in-500 figure; the court obtained the article to determine how that figure was derived. Doctor Brent testified that the 1-in-500 number had been carried forward and requoted in the195 literature dealing with acrodynia. The most likely explanation is not a hypersusceptible population, but rather the dose of teething powder that the children received. There were no dose-response studies with regard to acrodynia. Cedillo Tr. at 2483A. Cited in Warkeny, Cedillo Court Ex.

Cedillo Tr. at 131A. The mean normal blood mercury level in children age 1-5 in 1999-2000 was 0.34 \u00ecg/L. S.

Doctor A posh ian testified that recen t rese arch h ad established that a subse t of the population with a genet ic hypersuscep tibility to mercury does exist.

Peer review involves the review of submitted manuscripts by known experts in the field. Peer199 reviewers are supposed to read the articles carefully to ensure that the manner in which the research was carried out and the interpretation of the results of the research are the product of due care. Papers that are published after this process have had careful review by several reviewers. Peer review clarifies and improves papers, catching errors and mislabeling. Some journals are more reliable in this process than 100language scie ntific literatu re that reports a difference in blood or urinary mercury lev els in au tistic children as co mpared to controls. T hese are the easiest levels to measure . Cedillo T r. at 2469.Two of the three stu dies t hat petitione rs relied u pon to demonstrate aberrant m ercury ex cretion patterns in ch ildren with ASD in volved ha ir and teeth. The third, Dr. Bradst reet's 2 003 stud y, did involv e urine, b ut the paper was not publishe d in a peer review ed and inde xed journa l. Ced illo T r. at 2360. All three of these stu dies200 have signif icant flaws tha t adversely af fect the scientif ic reliability of their conclusio ns. In the Bradst reet study, filed a s Cedillo P et. Ex. 55, Tab E, 55 autistic children201 were m atched for age, sex, and vaccination status with eight, n on-ran domly select ed controls. Mea n urinary mercury ex cretion after th ree d ays of chelation was 6.42 \u00ecg/g of creatin ine for the ASD children and only 1.08 \u00ecg/g of creat inine for the control202 children . No lation levels w ere d etermine d for eith er group.

Ced illo Pet . Ex. 55 , Tab E, at 79. Othe r proble ms with th e Bradstree t 2003 article, a s noted by Dr. Brent, involv e others and have better reputations because of their high standards. Peer review also catches conflicts of interest to ensure that articles are not published for financial gain. Hazlehurst Tr. at 544A-46B. An indexed journal is one that is searchable by medical-scientific literature search engines. A200 journal may be non-indexed because it is new or because it is considered to be \"insufficiently rigorous\" for scientists to rely upon its publications. Cedillo Res. Ex. BB at 6. Doctor Ward noted that the Bradstreet 2003 study was published in the Journal of American Physicians and Surgeons, which, although published for over 50 years, remains non-indexed. Id. Medical literature may not be required as a condition precedent to finding vaccine causation. Althen, 418 F.3d at 1281. However, when medical literature is submitted as evidence, the type of medical literature submitted may be weighed and evaluated in determining what weight should be accorded to that evidence. The Supreme Court has noted: [S]ubmission to the scrutiny of the scientific community is a component of \"good science,\" in part because it increases the likelihood that substantive flaws in methodology will be detected. The fact of publication (or lack thereof) in a peer reviewed journal thus will be a relevant, though not dispositive, consideration in assessing the scientific validity of a particular technique or methodology on which an opinion is premised. Daubert, 509 U.S. at 593-94 (citations omitted). J. Bradstreet, et al., A Case-Control Study of Mercury Burden in Children with Autistic201 Spectrum Disorders, J. AM. PHYSICIANS SURGEONS 8: 76-79 (2003) [\"Bradstreet 2003\"]. Doctor Brent testified that this journal is not an indexed journal. Cedillo Tr. at 2360. Creatinine excretion rates are used to measure kidney function. DORLAND'S at 432-33. 202 The failure to ascertain pre-chelation levels of urinary mercury is contrary to standard practice,203 as petitioners' own expert conceded. Cedillo Tr. at 166. See also Snyder Tr. at 769A (Dr. McCabe testified that the appropriate way to conduct chelation is to establish a baseline level before administering a chelating agent). 101the huge and overlappin g range of values f or urina ry mercury lev els, th e failure t o control for die t between the two gr oups, an d the sta tistical m ethodology employed.

The standard deviation s exceede d the actual values rep orted , rendering th e data essen tially meaningless. Ced illo T r. at 2357. Doctor B rent also n oted that, given the large stan dard deviation s, it was unlikely that the differences b etween t he two group s were st atistically sig nificant. Based on the methodology described in the paper, Dr. Brent was unable to find a statistically significa nt result. Ced illo T r. at 2358; Ce dillo204 Res. E x. L, at 19. Additiona lly, the control group of children was se lected based on parental conce rns ab out environm ental mercury. Bradstre et 2003, Ced ilo Pe t. Ex. 55, Tab E, at 76. Docto r Brent testified that parents conce rned about mercury are likely to restrict seafood in th eir children 's diets, which would co ntribu te to lower urinary mercury lev els in the control ch ildren. Howev er, th e investigators f ailed to co ntrol f or die t in the study. Cedillo T r. at 2357-58.

Altho ugh no stud y was filed to indica te what p ost-che lation mercury ex cretion rates are typical, Dr. Brent base d his testim ony on his experien ce with norm al mercury lev els. Ce dillo T r. at 2341, 2355. Another proble m with th e Bradstree t 2003 study was th at the authors f ailed to state whether in dividuals who had undergone prior che lation were e xclude d. Given that the stud y subjects were individuals trea ted by Dr. Bradstree t, who use d multiple rounds of chelation with Colte n (see Snyder P et. Ex. 12, pp. 46-47,1 12-117, 151-52, 161-67, 543), the possibility that som e of the children stud ied h ad previous roun ds of chelation therapy cann ot be exclude d. Cedillo T r. at 2356, 2359-2360. I note that two of the co-authors of this study were Dr. Mark Geier and Mr. David Geier. This204 is not the first occasion in which other researchers have been unable to verify the validity of the Geiers' statistical analysis. See IOM, IMMUNIZATION SAFETY REVIEW: VACCINES AND AUTISM (Washington, DC: National Academies Press (2004)) at 55-62, 65 (calling their work unintelligible). A number of judges have had similar concerns about Dr. Geier's work. See, e.g., Graham v. Wyeth Laboratories, 906 F.2d 1399, 1418 (10 Cir. 1990) (Dr. Geier's calculation error was of sufficient magnitude so as to warrant a newth trial); Doe v. Ortho-Clinical Diagnostics, 440 F. Supp. 2d 465, 474 (M.D.N.C. 2006) (excluding Dr. Geier's testimony as based on \"hypothesis and speculation.\"); Redroot v. B.F. Ascher & Company, 2007 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 40002 (N.D. Cal.

Sup.Ct. 2003) (characterizing Dr. Geier's affidavit as \"conclusory and scattershot\" and \"undermined by many of the materials submitted in support of it\"). 102Another group of resea rchers at tempted to duplicate Dr. Brad street 's stud y. The Soden study, filed a s Cedillo Re s. Ex. OO, failed to find e vidence th at the autistic205 subje cts ha d excess levels of mercury or othe r hea vy metals. T his stu dy did no t suffer from the defects n oted by Dr. Bren t in the Bradst reet 2003 stu dy (C edillo T r. at 2357- 60), altho ugh th e numbers o f test subjects with aut ism d iagnoses and controls w ere smaller tha n in the Brad street 2003 study. To correct f or on e of the flaws noted in th e Bradst reet 2003 stu dy, dieta ry restrictions were im pose d, pre-chelat ion (b aseline ) urine levels w ere m easu red, diagnose s of autism were co nfirmed , and those with previous chela tion were e xclude d. Only one o f the autistic children had a post-chela tion urinary mercury level abo ve the lim its of detectio n. Non e of the typically developing contro l206 children showed post-chelat ion u rinary mercury lev els ab ove the limits o f detectio n (which was 1 \u00ecg). Becau se of the small nu mber of control sub jects, n o sta tistically significan t com parison could be made. The authors co nside red it highly significa nt, howev er, th at only one o f the ASD su bjects demonstrated a detectable level of mercury after ch elatio n. The Holme s stud y, found at Ced illo Pet . Ex. 55 , Tab X, com pared the level of207 mercury in hair from the first haircut of 92 children diagno sed with autism with th at of 45 age an d gend er matched controls. The study found much lower levels of mercury in208 the hair of autistic children than in the hair of control children (mean of 0.47 \u00ecg in autistic subje cts vs. me an of 3.63 \u00ecg in cont rols). Furthe r, the mercury lev els am ong the autistic sub jects were inversely correlate d with the severity of their autism , with the children with th e most se vere a utistic sympt oms having the lowest le vels of mercury. If correct, t hese findings do lend support to the theory that childre n with aut ism h ave difficulty ex creting me rcury . However, a m ajor p roblem with th e Holm es stu dy is that the findings are in conflict w ith hair an alysis data obtained in a very large stud y of mercury lev els in U.S . S. Soden, et al., 24-Hour provoked urine excretion test for heavy metals in children with autism205 and typically developing controls, a pilot study, CLIN. TOXICOL. 45: 476-81 (2007) [\"Soden\"]. After a month of a fish-free diet, he was chelated again, and the post-chelation urinary mercury206 declined from 23 \u00ecg after the first test, to 5 \u00ecg after the second challenge. A. Holmes, et al., Reduced Levels of Mercury in First Baby Haircuts of Autistic Children, INT'L207 J. TOXICOL. 22: 277-85 (2003) [\"Holmes\"]. Doctor Aposhian testifed that another study, one he referred to as the \"MIT\" study, had confirmed Holmes' findings. Cedillo Tr. at 98. He was apparently referring to a post chelation measurement of hair mercury levels in three individuals, with one control. This study, which involved a new technology for measuring mercury levels, suffered from the same defects as the Holmes' study. L. Hu, et. al., Neutron Activation Analysis of Hair Samples for the Identification of Autism, TRANSACTIONS AM. NUCLEAR SOC. 89: 681-82 (2003), filed as Cedillo Pet. Ex. 55, Tab Y. Hair analysis studies for heavy metals, and for mercury in particular, have been conducted208 frequently. Hair furthest from the scalp represents the oldest hair. Using hair obtained from the first baby haircut would capture the earliest mercury exposures. See, e.g., Cedillo Pet. Ex. 55, Tab D (Bakir); Cedillo Pet. Ex. 55, Tab G (Clarkson 2002); and Cedillo Pet. Ex. 55, Tab T (Grandjean 1998). 103children . Filed as Ce dillo Res. Ex. L, T 41, the McDow ell stud y esta blished that209 the mean hair mercu ry level of U.S. children ages 1 -5 was 0.22 \u00ecg, which was lower than the mean levels f or Holm es' au tistic sub jects, a nd much lower tha n the control subje cts. Ce dillo T r. at 2352. Altho ugh th e McDowell study did n ot use first bab y haircuts, co mparisons between the two studie s may still be m ade for two reason s . First, Ho lmes found similarly low lev els of mercury in current h air levels of autistic children , prior to her stud y of baby hair. Ced illo T r. at 2463-65; Holm es, Ce dillo Pe t. Ex. 55, any \"mercury efflux disorder\" w ould be genet based and unlikely to chan ge w ith age; un der the genetica lly-cause d mercury ef ould persist od. In any event, the extremely high dif ference between t he 0.22 \u00ecg mea n level f ound in the McDow ell stud y and the mean level of 3.63 in Holme s' non -autistic co ntrols st suggests tha t something w as wr ong wi th the control sam ples in the Holm es' stu dy. One reaso n for the discrepan cy in th e control sa mples cou ld be the methodology for ob tainin g them . According to the Holm es article, th e controls were recruited through appeals t o autism parent groups, an d the control ch ildren a nd parents were no t interview ed in pe rson. Hair sam ples were m ailed directly to th e lab orato ry, making true blindin g of sam ples d ifficult. I n the case of both the controls an d the subjects, the hair samples were no t obtaine d under cont rolled co nditio ns; in stead, the investig ators relied on parental repo rts to indicat e that the samples re prese nted first bab y hair cuts. Holme s, Ced illo Pet . Ex. 55 , Tab X, at 2 78-79. In 2007, another stu dy of the heavy metal cont ent of hair failed to replicate Holme s' findings. Forty-five children with ASD dia gnoses were m atched with 45210 controls f or age, gende r, and race /ethnicity. Inste ad of the striking dif ference between ASD su bjects and controls repo rted by Holmes, the repo rted mercury levels w ere n ot statistica lly different between the ASD su bjects and controls. The third st udy relied u pon by Dr. Aposh ian was the Adams stud y, filed a s Cedillo P et. Ex. 82. This stu dy of baby teeth showed mercury levels tw ice as high in211 autistic children as in controls. T his stu dy appe ars to contradict the Holm es and Bradst reet studies, which sho wed lower levels of mercury in autistic ch ildren. Docto r Brent also noted an error in th e methodology, suggesting tha t the resu lts were n ot M. McDowell, et al., Hair Mercury Levels in U.S. Children and Women of Childbearing Age: 209 Reference Range Data 1165-71 (2004) [\"McDowell\"]. J. et al., Sulfhydryl-Reactive Metals in Autism, J.

Ced illo T r. at 2467-69. Both the Holm es and Bradst reet studies ha ve been extensively criticiz ed, and other investigators ha ve failed to replicate their results. T he Adams study, even a side from its stat istical sho rtcom ings, doe s not sho w hypersusce ptibility. W eighing the evidence, I conclud e that petition ers ha ve failed to demonstrate that childre n with autism h ave dif ficulty ex creting me rcury , and thus th ere is n o reliab le evidence of a mercury efflux disorder or a hypersusce ptibility to m ercury in children with an ASD diagnosis. 3. The Effects o f Meth ylmercury . Even scept ibility to mercury or a mercury efflux disorder in a subset o f children with ASD, p etition ers w ould still have to demonstrate the effects o f mercury on th e immune system . Unf ortun ately, most o f the evidence of mercury' s effects co ncern s methylmercury , not the ethylmercury into which TCVs are metabolized. A very brief discussio n of methylmercury 's effects is in clude d here, because of Dr. Apo shian 's reliance on stud ies de aling w ith m ethylmercury . There is am ple e vidence th at methylmercury is toxic at so me doses a nd has more sub tle adverse ef fects a t lower dose s. It is also well-dem onstrated that fetuses and infants are more susce ptible than adults to methylmercury 's effects. But, there is n o evidence th at any lev el of exposure to methylmercury causes symptoms tha t mimic th ose of autism, or th at those exposed to mercury are more pron e to develop a utism . A lengthy article w ritten by Dr and Magos (Clarkson212 and Magos 20 06, Cedillo P et. Ex. 55, Tab H), sum marizes m uch of the prior rese arch regarding the effects o f mercury. Th ey note that in the Iraqi seed wheat disa ster, t he children who died from prenatal methylmercury exposure showed widesp read brain damage, inclu ding prob lems in ce ll division a nd in ne uronal cell m igration . In contrast, infants exposed during the f irst y ear o f life did no t exhibit m any adverse e ffects, even at fairly high blo od levels of mercury. Id., at 630, 635-36. They conclu ded that the fetal brain is very sensitive to methylmercury . Id., at 635. In the Minam ata Bay disast er in Ja pan, children exposed pren atally to high213 Evidence from the Iraqi methylmercury disaster established that the primary toxic effects from212 its ingestion included central nervous system damage (loss of sensation in hands and feet, paresthesia around the mouth, ataxia, slurred speech, diminution of vision, and loss of hearing). Prenatal exposure resulted in cerebral palsy with mental retardation. Bakir, Cedillo Pet. Ex. 55, Tab D. See T. Tsubaki and K.

Ex. 9 at 17, the context of the testimony sugg ests t hat Dr. Byers w as either t estifying from a docu ment that she had not prepared o r und erstoo d, or was sim ply conf used about the amount of mercury in thim erosa l. In either event, her frequent deferrals to Dr. Ken nedy, Dr. Kinsbo urne, and Dr. Ap oshia n, su ggest that she was offering testim ony out side h er expertise.

Doctors A posh ian a nd Byers relied prim arily upon two stu dies t o demonstrate mercury 's effects o n immune system cells, e xtrapo lating ef fects f rom in vitro or an imal studies to pred ict in vivo effects o n humans. Docto r Byers conced ed that many of the in vitro studies on the effects o f mercury on im mune respo nse failed to identify the dose of mercury necessa ry to establish th e effects, but testified that the Goth and Agrawal217 studies involv ed dose s of thim erosa l similar to , or le ss tha n, those found in vaccine s. 218 Cedillo T r. at 897A, 902A-03. Acco rding to Dr. B yers, th e Go th study dem onstrated that 20 \u00ecg of thim erosa l cause d abnormal I L-6 p roduction in mouse (murine) DC, an d the Agraw al stu dy showed tha t 25 \u00ecg of thim erosa l cause d abnormal I L-6 p roduction in human DC in vitro .

She provided no evidence that alte red IL-6 p roduction, or altera mune cells, any ef fect o n viral clea rance or would ca use damage to glial cells. The Goth stud y examin ed the effects o f various conce ntrations o f thim erosa l and ethylmercury on murine DC in cultu re. T he highest co ncen tration s killed m ore than 90% of the DC, prob ably by inducing ap optosis. No t surp rising ly, their viability w as dose -dependent. The authors st ated that a pract ical ap plication of their findings was identifying DC as sen sitive targets for ethylmercury mediated dysfu b e conside red in asse ssing contribution s to altere d immune functioning. G oth, Ced illo Pet . Ex. 55 , Tab Q, at 1090. In essence , they sugg ested that when immune dysfu nction was found, ethylmercury shou ld be considered as a possible ca use. The Agraw al stu dy looked at the in vitro effects o f thim erosa l on human DC. T he cells w ere cu ltured with th imerosal f or six -eight ho urs, th en stimu lated with LPS a nd then cultured with th imerosal f or an other 18 -20 h ours, and several dif ferent types o f respo nses were m a 50 nanomolar thim erosa l conce ntration, the cells shifted to a Th 2 function, which is a n anti-inf lammatory and pro-allergy respo nse.

Ced illo T r. at 2334- 35, 2438. He criticiz ed the reliance of Drs. Apo shian and Byers on the Goth and Agraw al articles. He co mmented: \"I think th ere's n o rea sona ble way anybody could conclu de from the Goth and Agraw al stu dies t hat the thim erosa l from the vaccine would cause imm unosupp ression. \" Cedillo T r. at 2325. As he pointe d out, the Goth article discusse d an in vitro stud y of a rare type o f mouse dendritic ce ll, not human cells. An d, as Drs.

Doctor McCab e provided addition al insights int o the signif icance of the Goth study. He testif l's ability to provoke ch in vitro is well , and that the Goth stud y demonstrat ed that it also do es so in DC. T he study showed that thimerosal red uced IL-6 prod uction . It did not demonstrat e an effect o n physiologi c or im munologic fu nction from the lower IL-6 levels. Sn yder T r. at 754A-55. He d escribed the Goth stu dy as linking A to B, and Dr. Byers' interpreta tion of that study as m oving from A to B to Z, while skipp ing all the step s in b etween. Snyder T r. at 755-56. Subjecting cells in cu lture t o ethylmercury does not mimic what h appens to ethylmercury in th e human body. Cultu red ce lls are n ot afforded the protect ion o f other body systems. Prote ins such as m etallothion ein, glutathio ne, and cysteine, which inactivate m ercury, are no t present in ce ll cultures. In vivo , mercury is transpo rted to the tissue s via red bloo d cells, and much of the mercury r emains b ound to those blood cells. T hese bloo d cells are n ot presen t when m ercury is applied directly to ce lls in culture . For these rea sons, cells in cu lture a re far more vulnerab le, and levels of subst ance s which would n ot ca use injury in vivo will kill cultu red ce lls. Cedillo T r. at 2321-23; Ced illo Pet . Ex. 55 , Tab H, at 629. Both stu dies in volved the exposure of cells to thim erosa l. Most cells in th e body are n ot expose d to thim erosa l after rece ipt of TCVs be cause thim erosa l rapidly breaks down into ethylmercury . Thus, any findings regarding thim erosa l exposure are n ot relevant to the effects o f TCVs be cause after administration of a TCV, th e vast m ajority of human cells are e xpose d to ethylmercury , not thimerosal. Accordin g to Dr. Bren t, Dr. Ap oshia n was incorrect when he testif ied that the conce ntrations o f thim erosa l used in th e Go th study equaled TCV-lev el exposu res. T he 100 nanomolar level of thim erosa l at which a cellular e ffect was sho wn is th e equivalent of about 20 \u00ecg/L of mercury ex posu re. Ho wever, in th e body, the mercury has to be 109unbound to act on cells, an d about 90% of the ethylmercury administered is bo und to red b lood cells, lea ving only 10% f ree to act on cells. S ome of that 10% is also bound to protein s and not available to act o n cells. T hus, an exposure to 20 \u00ecg/L in ce ll culture is the equivalent o f greater th an 200 \u00ecg/L of bloo d mercury. W hole bloo d levels of 200 \u00ecg/L are very high levels, an d far higher th an any child would h ave af ter administration of a TCV. Ced illo T r. at 2326-29A; Ce dillo Res. Tr. Ex. 17 a t 8-12. 219 Furthe r, the Goth stu dy does not address t he duration of the effects f rom exposure. Beca use the half-life of ethylmercury in th e blood is ap proximate ly 8 days (C edillo T r. at 2330), a substantial po rtion o f the mercury adm inistered would be elim inate d through urine or feces, and thus not available to act o n cells. Doctor B rent offered a sim ilar criticism of the Agraw al article. The 50 nanomolar level, at which ef fects were see n, would b e equivalent to a blood mercury lev el of 10 \u00ecg/L, 90 % of which would b e bound to red blood cells. In order to get DC exposed to 10 \u00ecg/L, th e whole b lood level of mercury w ould have to be at 100 \u00ecg/L. T hus, the culture d human DC w ere e xpose d to far greater le vels of thim erosa l than human infants would be when vaccinated with TCVs. Ce dillo T r. at 2331-32; Ced illo Res. T r.

Ce dillo T r. at 2332-33. Doctor McCuske r interpre ted the Agraw al pa per d ifferently than Dr. Byers did. The human DC treate d with thim erosa l were st imulated with LPS.

As Dr. Brent noted, the220 221 Shenker 1 992b stu dy involv ed f erent from222 See T.

Shenker, et al., Immunotoxic Effects of Mercuric Compounds on Human Mercuric Compounds on Human Lymphocytes and221 (1992) [\"Shenker 1992b\"]. The cross-examination concerned a reference to this study found in K. Pollard and P. Hultman.222 MERCURY AND THE IMMUNE SYSTEM, Chapter 14, \"Effects of Mercury on the Immune System,\" at 421-40 (publication date not provided), filed as Cedillo Pet. Ex. 81. 110that con taine d in vaccine s, an d much higher do ses o f mercury than would be found in vaccine s. Ced illo T r. at 2441. Doctor B rent ackno wledged that extreme ly small amounts of thim erosa l in T CVs w ill be co nverted t o mercuric m ercury ( also kn own as inorganic m , but that the amounts sho wing ef fects o n monocytes a nd B and T cells in th is stud y were far higher th an would be found after vaccinatio n. Cedillo T r. at 2443. The Shenker 1 992a stu dy inv olved the effects o f species of mercury other t han ethylmercury (methyl mercury chloride a nd mercury chloride ), on T cell pro liferation . It also in volved do ses h igher tha n those contained in vaccine s. Thus, neither st udy is particu larly helpful in d emonstrating even p ossible, much less pro bable, im mune system effects f rom the levels of thim erosa l found in vaccine s. As Docto r Brent testif ied: \"[i]f you w ant to this d iscussion in the true scien tific fashio n about what happened with ethylmercury at do ses a ssociate d with v accine s the n we shou ld discuss lite rature on ethylmercury at exposures we see with the vaccine. No w, I don't think were going to have that discussion and the reaso n being the re are no papers th at show any adverse ef fects.\" Cedillo T r. at 2453. Another stud y relied upon by Dr. Byers w as th e Horn ig study, which223 demonstrated that autoimmune disea se-sen sitive mice expose d to thim erosa l showed growth dela y and other chan ges, w hile m ice strain s with resista nce to autoimmunity were n ot affected.

Altho ugh on e stu dy dem onstrated som e associatio n with gastrointe stinal symptoms in a utism and families w ith a histo ry of autoimmune disorde rs, the224 difference between ch ildren with ASD a nd typically developing children in the stu dy was small. Le aving aside the prob lems in e xtrapo lating f rom anim al stu dies t o human effects, the small asso ciation between a possible genetic p redispo sition t o autoimmune disorde rs and autism is too small to render this stud y relevant t o the role of mercury in immune system m alfunctions.

The Petitioners' Omnibus exhibits were not filed into the record of any of the three Theory 1 test cases; they were filed by the PSC in the OAP prior to any test case being designated. Because Dr. Byers relied upon this article, which was discussed in other exhibits that were filed, I have read it to aid in evaluating Dr. Byers' testimony. See M. Vallicenti-McDermott, et al. Frequency of Gastrointestinal Symptoms in Children with224 Autistic Spectrum Disorders and Association with Family History of Autoimmune Disease, DEVEL. BEHAV. PEDIATRICS 27(2): 128-36 (2006) [\"Vallicenti-McDermott\"], filed as Cedillo Pet. Ex. 61, Tab HHHH. This cross-sectional study examined the association of gastrointestinal symptoms with a family with a history of autoimmune disease. A family history of autoimmune disease was reported in 38% of children with ASD, as compared to 34% of controls. 111Doctor B yers te stified that, in vitro , mercury inhibits ne utrop hil function. Neutro phils a re a part of the imm une system t hat kill by using an o xidative bu rst. Mercury inhib its the oxidative burst ca pacity of these ce lls. Cedillo T r. at 895. Doctor McCab e challenged Dr. Byers' testimo ny that mercury targets T regulatory cells (Cedillo T r. at 897A), te stifying that if there were a ny literature supp orting tha t statement, he would be aware of it. S nyder T r. at 749A. He also challen ged he r testim ony tha t mercury- induced autoimmunity in anim al models would demonstrate a sim ilar impa ct on the human immune system . The amounts of mercury given to mice in t he studies th at he examined would be approximate ly 1,000 times the amount of mercury in TCVs. Snyder T r. at 752-53. It is clea r that mercury has som e effects o n immune system cells. Do ctor Bre nt ackno wledged that monocytes a ppear to be the most se nsitive to m ercury' s effects, followed by B cells a nd then T cells. Ho wever, the re is insu fficient e vidence to conclude that vaccine level do ses o f ethylmercury have any ef fects o n the immune system , in vivo, much less th at they supp ress its f unctioning.

He te stified that intrau terine mercury ex posu re results in what is called a static ence phalopathy, a co nditio n very different from autism. Mercury exposure causes227 injury to the visual a nd auditory corte xes, b ut sp ares la rge neurons. In autism , the large To the extent, if any, that TCVs affect human embryos, the effects would be from vaccinations225 administered to the mother. That was not a theory presented in any of the Theory 1 test cases. Doctor Aposhian also stated that any form of mercury entering the brain is converted to226 mercuric mercury (inorganic mercury). This was an overstatement. Some of any form of mercury that enters the brain is converted into inorganic mercury; the amount varies by the species of mercury involved. The term \"encephalopathy\" can be applied to any degenerative disease of the brain. 227 DORLAND'S at 610-11. A static encephalopathy is one that is not changing. The general definition of an ecephalopathy should not be confused with the Vaccine Injury Table's more restrictive definition.

Pe titione rs have f ailed to demonstrate the existence of mercury ef flux disorders or a hypersuscep tibility of som e children with au tism to mercury' s effects.

Section VI. The Mea sles Theory . The MMR v accine is usu ally administered to children in th e U.S . between 12-15 months of age, shortly before p arents first begin to notice th e behavioral sympto ms228 that eventu ally lead to their children's A SD dia gnoses.

See Snyder Tr. at 432A-32B (Dr. Kennedy deferring to Dr. Kinsbourne for any testimony on how measles virus could cause autism, stating that his own \"knowledge of autism is very limited,\") and Dr. Byers' testimony indicating that she and Dr. Kennedy did not have the qualifications to say that MMR causes ASD. Cedillo Tr. at 947. Doctor Krigsman provided most of the information on gut disorders in autistic children, but it231 was Dr. Kinsbourne who linked the gut disorders and autism through this biologic process. Although there was ample evidence that \"autistic enterocolitis\" is not recognized as a distinct232 medical condition (see, e.g., testimony of Dr. Hanauer at Cedillo Tr. 2143; testimony of Dr. MacDonald, Hazlehurst Tr. at 662A-63), I use the term to discuss the theories advanced by petitioners. My use of this term should not be construed as a determination that the gut symptoms in those with ASD constitute a new disease process or a separate autism phenotype recognized by the medical community. 114child's au tism was ca used by the MMR v accine . As he testified: \"I would not give an opinion o n a case that did not have a positive biopsy...no r would I giv e an opinion if there was no rea son to even think of measle s.

This sect ion b egins w ith a discussio n of how the MMR theo ry first arose, followed by a m ore d etailed e xplication of the current theory. The discussion of \"autistic enteroco litis\" is fo llowed by the e vidence co ncern ing the wild strain measles virus, covering how the vaccine strain of the virus dif fers from the wild-ty pe virus, th eir particu lar ef fects o n the immune system , and the disease s com monly recognized as being caused by the virus strains. Finally, this sect ion e xamines P CR testing, p roblem s commonly encou ntered in such testing, and the prob lems demonstrat ed in the Unigenetics t esting pro gram in particular. I postpone a discussion of the testing specif ic to Co lten until Sectio n VIII. A. The Genesis an d Mut ation of the Measle s Theory of Autism Causa tion. 1. The Wakefield Hypothe ses.233 The original h ypothesis co nnecting MMR v accine and autism grew out of work by Dr. And rew Wakefield in the U.K. A number o f gastrointe stinal d isease s and234 Much of this section is drawn from the testimony of Dr. MacDonald in Hazlehurst. Doctor233 MacDonald testified that he was very familiar with the investigations of Dr. Wakefield's claims. Hazlehurst Tr. at 650A. Petitioners resisted respondent's efforts to focus some of respondent's experts' testimony on234 problems with Dr. Wakefield's hypotheses and research. During opening statements in Snyder, petitioners' counsel characterized respondent's evidence regarding Dr. Wakefield as a \"smear campaign.\" Snyder Tr. at 24. I found the testimony and exhibits pertaining to Dr. Wakefield to be highly relevant for several reasons. First, Dr. Wakefield is responsible for much of the research supporting the autistic enterocolitis theory, relied upon by Dr. Kinsbourne, proposing vaccine causation in those children with the postulated \"regressive autistic enterocolitis\" phenotype. Second, the validity of specific tests for measles viral material in gut tissue performed by the Unigenetics laboratory is critical to Dr. Kinsbourne's theory. Doctor Wakefield was a co-author of the paper reporting the testing performed by Unigenetics, and the primary author or co-author of numerous journal articles filed as evidence in the Theory 1 cases. Doctor Wakefield was, at one time, the Director of Research for the International Child Development Resource Center, a nonprofit corporation created by Colten's treating physician, Dr. Bradstreet. Snyder Tr. at 254- 55. Finally, Dr. Wakefield filed a \"commentary\" (Snyder Pet. Ex. 27), on Dr. Ward's supplemental report in Snyder (Snyder Res. Ex.

As such, his scientific methodology and theories, and the validity of the research supporting them, are fair game for criticism. 115cond itions a re discu ssed in this ulcerative colitis are235 236 chron ic inflammatory disease s of the intestines.

Doctor Wakefield characterizes Dr. Ward as being annoyed, but says nothing about Dr. Ward telling him that the abstract was based on errors. Doctor Wakefield implied that Dr. Ward was withholding data that would have confirmed Dr. Wakefield's findings. I accept Dr. Ward's account as correct. It seems clear that children with autism experience more gastrointestinal symptoms, with260 slightly greater frequency, than do other children. See Vallicenti-McDermott, Cedillo Pet. Ex. 61, Tab HHHH. This cross-sectional study compared lifetime prevalence of gastrointestinal symptoms in children with ASD, children with typical development, and children with other developmental disabilities. A history of gastrointestinal symptoms was elicited in 70% of children with ASD, compared with 28% of children with typical development and 42% of those with other developmental disabilities. The incidence of an abnormal stool pattern was higher in children with ASD (18%) than in those with typical development (4%) and those with other developmental disabilities (2%). Two shortcomings exist in this study: it is based on parental reports, rather than medical records, and it does not distinguish between classic and regressive autism. Children with ASD are more likely to have pica or self-restricted diets. Cedillo Tr. at 2716A-17A.

A ll of these experts' o pinion s, with the exception of Dr. Aposhian 's, reste d on the actual prese nce of measle s virus in ch ildren with ASD. Doctor K insbo urne's role was to p rovide the theory or th eories to explain how me asles virus cou ld, directly or ind irectly , cau se at least som e cases o f ASD. He initially of fered two som ewhat relat ed theories to explain h ow mea sles vir us See D. Chitkara, et al., Incidence of Presentation of Common Functional Gastrointestinal269 Disorders in Children from Birth to 5 Years: A Cohort Study, CLIN. GASTROENT.

This im balance manifested in the behavioral an d communicatio n disorders th at are au tism's co re features. Between the Cedillo hearing in Jun e, 2007, and the filing of post-hea ring brief s in Snyd er in March, 2008, Dr. Kinsb ourne reformu lated the theories linking th e neuroinflammation theory more clo sely with th e over-arousa l theory. In his su pplemental repo rt, he referred t o his the ory's270 271 three points a s cau sally linked \"stages,\" set forth below: Stage 1.

Once in the brain , the virus co uld a ffect se veral types o f brain cells,272 After the conclusion of the causation hearing in Snyder, petitioners requested the opportunity270 to file a supplemental expert report by Dr. Kinsbourne. See Motion for Leave to File Supplemental Report of Dr. Marcel Kinsbourne Contemporaneous with Petitioners' Post-Hearing Brief, dated February 7, 2008. I granted their request, over respondent's objections, giving respondent the opportunity to file a supplemental expert report in response. See Order, dated February 28, 2008. Petitioners filed Dr. Kinsbourne's supplemental report on March 10, 2008, as Snyder Pet. Ex. 215. Respondent filed the supplemental response of Dr. Wiznitzer on April 10, 2008, as Snyder Res. Ex. DD.

Nevertheless, I considered both Drs. Kinsbourne's and Wiznitzer's supplemental reports. Doctor Byers testified that one specific cytokine, TNF-\u00e1, causes the blood-brain barrier to272 become more permeable, increasing the ability of cytokines to reach brain tissues.

Snyder Tr. at 464A-65A . According to Dr. Kinsb ourne, the prese nce of inflammation indicat ed an ongoing, lon g-term disea se process, rathe r than a static proce ss cau sed by prena tal damage to the brain . In his view , the type o f inflammation found, activated microgl ia, indicat ed an innate im mune system respo nse to the prese nce of an agent recognized as foreign.

Doctor K insbo urne's rt also indicat ed that chro nic inf lammation had been found in the cereb rum and the cereb ellum of children with ASD. He considered this finding con sistent with th e effects o f a ch ronic vir al inf ection . Ced illo Pet . Ex. 61 , at 17- There are two main categories of brain cells: neurons and glia. Neurons perform brain273 functions and control other body systems. Glia act like the connective tissue found in other organs and also function as immune cells in the brain. Astroglia (astrocytes), a specialized form of glia shaped like stars, are very prevalent in the brain and are scattered among the neurons. Microglia are the brain's innate immune system. Oligodendroglia are the cells that manufacture the fatty sheaths along axons, called myelin. Myelin acts as insulation along the axons, similar to the role of plastic coating along electrical wires.

Doctor Kinsbourne agreed that microglial activation might have other causes, including275 activation in response to a breakdown of neurons. Microglial activation is found in both Parkinson's disease and Alzheimer's. Cedillo Tr. at 1091. The Vargas 2005 article cited by Dr. Kinsbourne indicated that the inflammatory processes observed in autistic brains resemble those seen in Alzheimer's, Parkinson's, and amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, and have some similarities to those seen in HIV infection. They did not find adaptive immune reactions in the ASD patients. The authors noted that co-morbid conditions, such as epilepsy, might play a role in their findings. 13018.

Landau-Kleffner syndrome involves paroxysmal EEG discharges (sleep-activated), predominating over the temporal or parieto-occipital regions, and language deterioration (acquired aphasia), with manifestation at three to nine years of age. Word deafness is the first manifestation, with parents reporting that children no longer respond to commands. This may deteriorate into total unresponsiveness or impaired expressive communication. This language disorder has similarities to ASD, including abnormal development of spoken language, impaired ability to initiate or sustain conversation, and stereotyped, repetitive, and idiosyncratic language. Differences between the two syndromes include an earlier loss of language in ASD, more dramatic loss in LKS, and a different behavioral profile in ASD (core symptoms of ASD). EEG findings in LKS are striking. The etiology of LKS is unknown. Corticosteroid treatment in LKS has proven effective for both clinical and EEG abnormalities, suggesting a chronic encephalitic etiology. Lewine, Snyder Pet.

In summary, the evidence, including articles by the researchers Dr. Corbier identified, indicates that there are some unusual immune parameters in some of those with ASD, but no evidence that it is an autoimmune condition. There is no evidence that the immune system findings are related to ASD's pathogenesis. See generally, IOM 2004 Report, Cedillo Res. Ex. JJ, at 131. 295 Doctor Zimmerman's report clearly indicated that he did not believe the MMR vaccine to be causal of autism. Cedillo Res. Ex. FF at 4. The papers listing Dr. Gupta as the primary author were published in 1998 and 2000 (filed as Cedillo Res. Ex. R, Tab 22 and Snyder Pet. Ex. 181) took no position on vaccine causation. Doctor Ashwood's two articles were both discussed at some length. The Ashwood 2006 article reflected the lack of consistency in the research into immune system parameters in children with ASD. Doctor Singh's research came closest to suggesting some connection, but his own findings were inconsistent and criticized. See discussion in Parts D and E, below. 139symptoms are most com monly noted , most ch ildren with ASD wil l have th is tem poral relation ship.

Doctor Griffin explained that the virus has an affinity for lymphoid tissue and endothelial cells anywhere they are found, but that the virus does not preferentially select gut tissue. Both lymphoid tissue and endothelial cells are found in the gut. Cedillo Tr. at 2755-56. I accept Dr. Griffin's testimony as correct. \"Neurotropic\" means having an affinity for nervous tissue. Cedillo Tr. at 1068. Doctor Griffin308 indicated that, in children dying of acute measles infection, the virus was only located in brain endothelial cells, not in brain tissue itself. In the rare neurological illnesses associated with persistent measles virus, a characteristic measles inclusion body can be seen on autopsy. Cedillo Tr. at 2756-57, 2789A. Doctor Kennedy testified that the vaccine strain measles virus was attenuated in monkey309 kidney cells and tested for virulence in mice. Cedillo Tr. at 714A.

Doctor Kennedy testified that the period of immune suppression from wild-type measles virus312 lasts from three to six months. Cedillo Tr. at 717-18A. Other testimony established that the longer period applied only in patients who were immunosuppressed at the time of the measles infection. Cedillo Tr. at 1889-91 (Dr. Ward) and 2799-2802 (Dr. Griffin); Snyder Tr. at 831-36A (Dr. Rima). I found the testimony of Drs.

In essence , petitione rs cont end that childre n with regressiv e autism have both prima ry and second ary imm une system d efects. The prima ry defect is a genet ic predisposition resultin g in an immune \"dysr egulation \" prior MMR v accina tion. 316 The secon dary def ect, allegedly caused by the effect o f TCVs an d the measle s vaccine virus on the imm une system, ostensibly results in a suppression of imm une respo nse and an ineffective atte mpt to clear t he measles vaccine virus f rom the body. T his section discusse s the evidence for imm une system m alfunctions in children with ASD, and the imm unological ef fects o f measle s vaccine vir us on children with ASD a nd on those with imm une system d efects. 1. Evidence th at Ch ildren with Aut ism h ave Malf unctioning Im Systems. Petitione rs' argumen ts on p oint were b latan tly circular. E vidence th at a child had autism was used to demonstrate that the immune system of the child was malfunctioning. Evidence that a child h ad a malfunctioning im mune system was used317 to demonstrate why the virus persisted to cause autism. There was no evidence introd uced that childre n with aut ism h ave genetic d efects t hat alter their imm une respo nse to viruses or o ther pathogen s. There was evidence th at so me of those with ASD h ave unu sual im mune system profiles, alth ough t hese findings were not consiste nt. There was no evidence th at these profiles ha ve any clinical sig nificance . Doctor B yers op ined that the impaired imm une systems o f autistic children render their bo dies u nable to clear live v irus v accine s, includ ing MMR . Ced illo T r. at 935-39. As a result of the children 's imp aired immune systems, the measle s vaccine virus can cause an exaggerated inflammatory response . Ced illo T r. at 952-53. However, Dr. By ers of fered no convincing supp ort for the proposition t hat autistic children have immune system weakn esses, genet ically -cause d or otherwise. Petitioners' theory does not depend on establishing an exact cause for the postulated immune316 \"dysregulation.\" Petitioners can prevail, without demonstrating any effect of TCVs on the immune system, if they can demonstrate that the measles virus persists. However, a malfunctioning immune system makes the persistence of the measles virus more likely, regardless of the cause of the malfunction. Doctor Byers made precisely this argument: \"One has to say that genetically, an autistic child317 has an immune system that is innately prone to being damaged, and it appears that the main place that it is going to be damaged is by an aberrant reaction to environmental stimuli.\" Cedillo Tr. at 935. 147Accordin g to Dr. Byers, an Ashwood article regarding imm une respo nse in318 autism p rovided a goo d summary of what was kn own abo ut the immune status of autistic children . Ced illo T r. at 891A-93A . The Ashwood 2006 paper describe d a number o f stud ies finding various, a nd sometimes co ntrad a ildren. It noted that many of the stud ies com pared autistic children to adult con trols an d failed to co ntrol f or the medica tion statu s of the autistic children , which could be a signif icant confounding f actor. The authors a lso no ted a possib le pa tient select ion b ias in t he studies. T hey specu lated that the discordan t results f rom some stu dies m ay \"poten tially reflect d ifferent autism behavioral phenotypes.\" Ashwood 2006 Ced illo Pet . Ex. 61 C, at 4. Ashwood's co nclusion noted: \"Within t he literatu re de scribing imm une-base d stu dies in ASD, there are a number o f discrep ancie s and unreplicated repo rts.

At best, th is article su ggested that im mune dysfu nction may play a role in sub groups of patients with autism , without actual evidence that the discorda nt results tru ly reflected subgroups of ASD. It offered no support for the proposition that the MMR v accine caused immune suppression or for vaccines a s causa tive agents in autism. Cedillo T r. at 1816-17. Docto r Byers testif ied that most o f the repo rts found that autistic ch ildren h ave abnorma l inna te im nses, particularly overly react ive inflammatory respo nses. She referred t o the Jyonou chi stu dy as d emonstrating ab norm al levels of319 three proin flammatory cy tokine s in IL-6. Ce dillo T 889A-90A . The article d id de monstrat e higher lev els of these cytokines in the autistic children stud ied, compared to a co ntrol p opulation of adults.

Doctor Byers did not identify which of the several articles authored by Jyonouchi she meant, but from context, it appears that she was referring to this one. However, later in her testimony (Cedillo Tr. at 893A), she mentioned articles by Jyonouchi written in 2000 and 2006. No articles by Jyonouchi published in 2000 or 2006 were filed.

These cells are part of the adaptive immune system . Ced illo T r. at 891A-92A . When the innate im mune system fails to clear a n invading pa thogen, th e adaptive immune system activates. She testified that these im mune system findings were indicat ive of a ch ronic infection in th e autistic ch ildren st udied. Cedillo T r. at 891A. The 2004 paper actually found sim ilar CD3 cell cou nts in both the ASD ch ildren, referred f or gastrointe stinal co mplaints, and in th e typically developing children, referred f or inflammatory bow el dise ase. The study found no correlation between the degree of inflammation in the children with ASD a nd the prop ortion 61, Tab B, at 668-69. Doctor McCuske r disagreed with Dr. Byers regarding bot h the evidence of immune system d ysfunction in those with ASD a nd any causa l role o f imm une dysfu nction in autism . She testif ied that autism was once thought to be relate d to immune dysfu nction , but this hypothe sis is no longer gene rally acce pted. The initial article su ggesting a role f or imm une dysfu nction in ca using au tism, published in 1976, was based on a ca se rep ort. Several stud ies ha ve since tried to evaluate im munity in autism, but have returned inco nsisten t findings. Ce dillo T r. at 2207; Ce dillo Res. Ex. Z at 2. In her own experien ce, h aving tested the imm une profiles of approximate ly 100 children with autism over eight years, she found only one su ch ch ild with an immune deficiency. She did not believe that im mune deficiencies o r imm une mecha nism s play any role in the development of autism. Hazlehurst T r. at 585A-86A . Doctor B yers' po sition is sim ply unsup porte d by the evidence adduce d. As th e Ashwood 2006 survey article indica ted, studies sh owing imm une dysfu nction in autism were frequent ly contradicto ry and most su ffered from some defects. Howev er, Dr.322 McCusker's testim ony did n ot address the evidence from the Vargas stu dy, that the brains and CSF of autistic individuals d emonstrated som e degree o f inflammation associa ted with an inn ate imm une system resp onse . Whether this is a cause of autism, or simp ly an effect o f autism, is no t yet esta blished . Certa in of Vargas's f indings suggest tha t the inflammation may be an effect. Vargas found that tumor grow th factor- \u00e21 (an anti-inflammatory cy tokine involv ed in tissue remodeling af ter inju ry) was one of the most p revalent cytokines f ound in brain tissues of autistic individuals. Vargas 20 05, Cedillo P et. Ex. 61, Tab MMM , at 79. Doct or Zimm erma n, a co-au thor of this p aper, noted that, in spite of the findings of imm une activation in au tism, there was no Cedillo Pet.

Ad dition ally, evidence demonstrat ing that measles vaccines are rou tinely gi ven to ch ildren with cha llenged o r com prom ised immune systems, withou t harmful effects, undercuts the theory that the vaccine virus is immunosupp ressiv e or lead s to viral persisten ce. The studies cited by Dr. Corbier, an d other petitione rs' ex perts, as e vidence for an altere d immune respo nse to measle s vaccine ildren with au tism, were incon sistent , and frequent ly their results were not replicat ed by othe r research ers. Summaries of the many dif ferences in immune system p aram eters found in autism resea rch m ay be f ound in the Ashwood 2006 article, Ce dillo Pe t. Ex. 55, Tab C, at 6 and in a slightly more rece nt article by Libbe y.324 The Singh stu dies were illustrative of this p roblem . The initial Sin gh stud y325 found no signif icant difference in measles a ntibo dy lev els be tween children with ASD and typically developing contro ls. Su bseque nt studies by Singh sho wed significan tly higher levels of measle s antibod ies in ch ildren with involv controls, found different resu lts. 327 Myelin, the insulation that sheathes the brain's axons, can be damaged in a number of ways. 323 When damaged, internal components of the myelin, which include myelin basic protein, leak out into the surrounding tissues. Some damage to myelin can be repaired by the oligodendrocytes. Snyder Tr. at 573. Myelin basic protein is one of the most abundant proteins found in myelin, comprising about 30% of the total protein in myelin. It has a very strong positive charge and is very alkaline.

Age-matching controls and subjects is important in comparing immune system parameters327 because these parameters change significantly with age. Libbey, Snyder Res. Ex.

This 150The ASD ca se ch ildren were divided int o two groups, classic on set a nd regressiv e onse t. Typically developing children and children with T ourette's syndrom e were use d as co ntrols.

The study also compared measle s antibod y levels to MBP autoantibo dies in the ASD ch ildren. Unlike th e Singh stud ies, th ey fo und no correlatio n between a ntibo dies against m easle s and antibo dies a gainst MBP. The Singh 2 002 authors specu lated that the high MBP levels and high m easle s antibod y titers t hat they found in autistic children evidenced an autoimmune proce ss. Howev er, other research ers found no evidence of cross-reactivi ty of antibod ies to MBP a nd measles virus, indica ting tha t if the MBP antibodies were evi dence for an autoimmune proce ss, th e measle s virus w as not triggering that process. Libbey, Snyder Res. E x. BB at 255. At best, the evidence for an altered im mune respo nse to measle s vaccine in children with ASD is con tradicto ry. The Libbey study clearly contradicte d the findings in the Singh st udies and, unlike th e Singh stud ies, a ccoun ted for a significan t con founder, the mean age o f the case children , as compared to the controls. The evidence that childre n with com prom ised im mune system s saf ely tolerate the measle s vaccine also undercu ts the argument that immune system dysfu nction an aberrant resp onse to measles vaccine, contributin g to th e developm ent of ASD. The World Hea lth Organization recom mends that asymp tomatic ch ed HIV inf ection s receive me asles vaccines. In fact, an extra dose , administered at six months of age, is re commended. See W.

Approximately 14,0 00 mothers and babies were recruite d for a study of mother-to-child factor alone could account for the difference in antibody levels in ASD children as compared to controls in the studies. Older subjects had lower measles antibody levels than younger subjects in all the studied populations. Although the group differences in antibody levels were not statistically significant, more of the328 ASD children, in both the regressive and early onset groups, had very low or absent titers against the rubella virus than those in the two control groups. The individuals with very low or absent rubella titers were dropped from the analysis of variance. Libbey, Snyder Res. Ex. BB at 254. 151transm ission o f HIV.

See Snyder T r. at 362A-63A . 330 Another factor sugg esting th at measle s vaccines do not cau se clinically ev ident immune suppression is tha t measle s vaccines are routinely adm inistered to individuals with kn own prior tub erculosis e xposu re or e ven laten t tubercu losis w ithou t activation or reactivation of the tuberculosis. Cedillo T r. at 1883A-84 A, 1887A-89. I con clude that petitione rs have f ailed to demonstrate that the MMR v accine cause s imm unosupp ression. There is no evidence that childre n rece iving the vaccine have higher rat es of infection in th e months after vaccinatio n than children who do not receive the vaccine. T he immunosupp ression seen after wi ld-type measles in fection s affects t he body's ability to com bat other inf ection s, no t measle s itself .

In the year following vaccination, more female recipients died after the high-dose vaccine than after the standard-titer vaccines. The 2003 study examined the hypotheses offered to explain the higher mortality rates, and concluded that an increased immunosuppressive effect of the high-titer vaccine was an unlikely explanation. In any event, the problems with the high-titer measles vaccine have no bearing on the role330 measles virus might play in causing ASD. Doctor Rima was part of a WHO team created to look at evidence of increased mortality in recipients of the high-titer vaccine. The increased mortality was on the border of statistical significance when boys and girls were considered together, but when female mortality was considered separately, there were statistically significant higher mortality rates in the girls receiving the high-titer vaccine. Doctor Rima testified that the data obtained from the review did not suggest that the increased mortality was due to any immune dysfunction.

Measles Infection s. Measles is a se rious a nd highly infectiou s disea se. It carries a signif icant risk of mortality , particularly in developing cou ntries. In a 1988 measle s epidem ic in Gu inea- Bissau , there was a 9 .8% mortality rate in ch ildren u nder 3 years of age who con tracte d measles. It is the seco nd most com mon cause of vaccine-preventab le de ath in331 children worldw ide, killing 450,000 to 500,000 children annually. Ced illo T r. at 2797. The disea se ta kes a pproximately one to two weeks to manifest. During the first 10 days af ter inf ection , a perso asy mptomatic.

T he skin rash occu rs bet ween nine and fifteen days after inf ection , marking the peak level of virus in the body, known as th e period of maximum viremia. Generally, the rash lasts f or ab out three to five days, and appears332 as th e adaptive immune system mounts its resp onse to the virus. The virus is333 generally cleared f rom the body by arou nd 20 days af ter inf ection . Ced Res. T r. 1; Ced illo T r. 2751-53, 2758-59. Altho ugh m infects lymph oid a nd epith elial cells.

In the millions of case s of measle s trea ted worldw ide, no evidence of a disease proce ss in h umans similar to diste mper in ca nines has em erged; distem per is n early alw ays fa tal in canin es; a nd measles virus is known to infect the brain in hu man only rarely.

The measles virus is a wi dely-r ecognized cau se of several types of are consid ered to be persiste nt measle s viral inf ection s because they occu r months or years a fter m easle s disea se as the result of ineffective clearan ce of the measle s virus from the body.

In rare complications of measles discussed below, the virus spreads to the brain, causing334 death in most cases. These deaths, however, occur months or years after the measles infection. Doctor Kennedy also acknowledged that persistent morbilliviruses generally result in death to the host and canine distemper virus causes death in most canines infected. Cedillo Tr. at 789-91. This condition is sometimes called post-measles viral encephalomyelitis, 2743A-44.

(1) Viral Pe rsistence in Ge neral. In an introduction to a medica l journa l article, read repe atedly in337 Cedillo Michae l Oldsto ne, world's m ost h ighly regarded virologists ( see generally , Dr. W ard's te stimo ny, Snyder T r. at 952A-62A ), wrote that viruses persist when the host fails to form an appropriate imm une respo nse or fails to clear th e virus; that viruses can acquire un ique strate gies of replicat ion b y regulating gene expression to persist w ithou t killing host ce lls; and that the disease s cau sed by replicating v iruses are o ften new and unexpecte d. The implication drawn f rom Dr. Oldsto ne's gen eral state ments was tha t the measle s virus cou ld sim ilarly surprise t he scientists who study it by persisting in vaccinate d children a nd causin g autism . In the Snyd er hearing, Dr. Oldsto ne respo nded to the use of his sta tements in Cedillo with a lette r filed a s Snyder Re s. Ex. AA.

Petitioners objected to the admission of the second paragraph of this letter (Snyder Res. Ex.338 AA) as an untimely filed expert report on the ultimate issue in this case. Snyder Tr. at 11-12. At the hearing, I indicated that the parties could address this issue in their post-hearing briefs. However, I also indicated that, to the extent that Dr. Oldstone was stating that his work did not support the proposition for which it was repeatedly cited, I would consider the entire letter as rebuttal evidence. Snyder Tr. at 15-16. I did not consider Dr. Oldstone's opinion as substantive evidence in forming my opinion on causation. 155Measles virus ha s been a focus of my labo ratory fo r many years so this autism/m easle s link ha s been of interest to me. Furthe r, I sh ould state up front that I se e at present no evidence whatsoever f or such a link. Even w ithou t con sidering Dr. Oldsto ne's le l state in Oldsto ne's 2 006 article (Ced illo .

A deterioratio n in schoo l perf orma nce is sometimes an early sympto e attention deficits, prob lems in conce ntration, jumps and jerks (called m yoclon us), a nd other moveme nt disorders. Both a characteristic EE G ab norm ality and h igh lev els of antibod y to measles a re found in the CSF o f individuals with SSP E. Brain im aging studies show big v entricles, w hich are in dicative of a sh rinking brain. By the t ime the first sy mptoms are prese nt, the disea se is a lready w idesp read throughou t the nervous system . Snyder T r. at 842A- 43A, 941A; Cedillo T r. at se is rare, only occu rring around 1 in 1,000,000 children , and340 prima rily in th ose who were le ss tha n two years of age when t hey cont racted measle s. The pathogen esis of the disea se process is n ot kn own, but the virus likely enters th e brain of the children at the time of the original inf ection . Becau se th e disease develops in those who had a mild case of measle s, it is p ossible that their bo dies d id no t mount an appropriate ly stron g immu ne respo nse. The virus replicate s slowl y, building up t o a thresh old o f infection sufficient t o trigg er dise ase symptoms. After lap sing into a com a, Doctor Wiznitzer placed the onset as early as three years after exposure to the wild-type virus. 339 Cedillo Tr. at 1627. However, I accept Drs. Griffin and Ward's testimony of a five-to-ten year latency period as correct, based on their greater expertise in measles virology. See Norrby and Kristensson, Cedillo Res. Ex. DD, Tab 8. Doctor Griffin's chapter in FIELDS340 VIROLOGY, Cedillo Res. Ex.

Much of the evidence introd uced in th e gene ral cau sation case , and in Colten 's specif ic case, conce rned whether the positive test results for measle s virus w ere sufficiently reliable to be given any w eight as evidence. The testin g was performe d by Unigenet ics, an uncertif ied la boratory, f ounded by I am mindful of Dr. Corbier's opinion on causation, which also relied heavily on findings of345 measles virus in affected children. Although he indicated he would find in favor of MMR causation, even without evidence of viral persistence, that portion of his opinion was limited to autoimmune reactions. Part E, above, explains the lack of support for his opinions on impaired immune function and autoimmunity as another causal mechanism. Positive test results were reported for both Michelle Cedillo and Colten Snyder. I address346 Colten's specific test results in Section VIII, below. The discussion in this section concerns the reliability and validity of the positive findings for measles virus in general. 159Dr. John O'Le ary and Dr. Orla S heils a t Trinity College in Du blin, I reland .

Additiona l informa tion was su pplied by Drs. Kenn edy, W ard, Rima, Bustin, a nd A reference or certified laboratory is required to undergo external evaluation to determine how347 well it performs.

In view of the subsequent failure to publish any results of the immunohistochemical testing, Dr. Chadwick's testimony that the immunohistochemical results from the Royal Free Hospital could not be reliably reproduced, and other evidence that Unigenetics did not perform immunohistochemical testing (see Cedillo Tr. at 651-52A), I have given Dr. Kennedy's testimony on the positive results of these tests little weight. 160Chad wick.

A Molecu lar Biology Primer. Deoxy ribonu cleic acid [\"DNA\"] is ma de up of four types of nucleotid es (some times called \"base s\"), ade nine [\"A\"], nine T hese es form bonds: T bind s only to A; G bind s only to C, creat ing what are called \"base pairs.\" DNA mo lecules resem ble a very twisted spiral sta ircase, with th e base pairs f ormin g the ru ngs. On e run g could b e forme d by the T nucleotid e on one side and the A nucleo tide on the other; a seco nd rung might b e ide ntical t o or the mirror image of the first, or it m ight be compose d of a G-C bon d. The nucle otide s are bonded in two cha ins formin g the sid es of the ladd er, as well as bonded to their p aired base on the opposite chain. W hen the bonds between the base pairs are \"un zipped\" or b roken , as if cleaving a ladd er from top to bottom, each strand of the molecu le forms a mirror image of the other. S plitting the molecu le in t his manner, in th e body or in a test tube, is t he first step in rep licating, or a mplifying, DNA. The splitting of me, b y heating (de naturing) the DNA. Ced illo T r. at 589A-92A . After sp litting, the missing half of the rungs on each side of the ladd er are replace d by a polymerase enzy me, which add s the missing nucleo tides to recreate the complem entary stran d of DNA. T wo ide ntical co pies o f the original DNA sequen ce are create d. Cedillo T r. at 593A-97A . The sequen ce of A, G, T, and C n ucleo tides forms unique patterns of \"words,\" forme d from the four \"lett ers.\" es ascertain ing the nucle otide orde r in a particular DNA se gmen t. DNA segme nts form genes. DNA da tabanks contain the exact orde r of nucleotid es for many genes. If a scie ntist f inds a particular DNA sequen ce and wants to determin e the source o f the DNA, a databank inquiry can be made. Dete rmining th e nucleo tide sequen ce requires, a s a first step , that the strand of DNA con tainin g those nucleotid es be \"am plified\" o r copie d. Cedillo T r. at 589A. If the target st rand contains RNA inste ad of DNA, th e RNA m ust first be converted to DNA, be cause RNA can not be amplified b y PCR. I n RNA, one of the base s tha t makes up the molecu le is dif ferent from the four b ases found in DNA. In the proce ss of making the RNA into DNA, th e correspon ding DNA ba se is su bstitu ted. If the RNA is ne gativ e sense, an addition al ste p is n ecessa ry. The negative sen se RNA must be converted to positive sen se RNA, and then converted t o DNA. The proce ss of Doctor Ward commented that Dr. Hepner did a very good job of explaining PCR testing. His351 only issue with her testimony was that she left the impression that PCR is simply a matter of putting a sample in a machine, pressing a button, and getting correct results at the other end, ignoring the need for subjective interpretation or considering the possibility of human or machine errors. Cedillo Tr. at 1840A. 161turnin g RNA into DNA is ca lled \"reverse transcript ion\" [\"RT \"]. The DNA tha t is crea ted is called \"cDNA,\" ref lecting tha t it is a copy of the RNA.

The conversion o f RNA to DNA use s an enzyme called reverse transcripta se and a primer co mposed of T bases to creat e a com plem entary versi on of the RNA.

Polymerase chain rea ction is a m ethod of expone ntially replicating a st rand of DNA. Ced illo T r. at 592. Using con ventional (or solutio n-based) P CR, extremely sma ll quantitie s of DNA can be amplified, creatin g enou gh DNA to produce a visible \"ban d\" on a gel. A ny specif ic section of a DNA strand can be targete d for am plification , so long as a t least som e part of the sequen ce is kn own. Cedillo P et. Ex. 120 at 9. Altho ugh extensively automated, su bjective asse ssme nts a re required in PCR analysis and , therefore, both mecha nical a nd human errors ossible.

For the se rea sons, it is esse ntial t o establish strict sta ndard testing proto cols an d quality contro l measure s. a. Steps in Convention al PCR. (1) Sele cting Prime rs. The first step in amplifying DNA is to se lect p rimers. A \"prime r\" is a sectio n of DNA tha t is com plem entary to a portion of the target st rand of DNA. A prime r352 consists of a nucleo tide sequen ce of about 20 nucleotid es. Prime rs are d esigned to be specif ic to t he two ends of the target se quence . They can be purch ased com mercially selecte d based on the sequen ce of nucleotid es in the target se ction of the gene. Cedillo T r. at 594-96A. The prime rs nee d to be specific to t he target DNA to be amplified a nd the specif ic section of DNA to be amplified sh ould not be prese nt in any other gene . If the prime rs are n ot sp ecific eno ugh, DNA o ther than the target se quence might be amplified a long w ith (or inst ead of) the target DNA, amplifying the wrong sub stance, resulting in a false p ositive. Cedillo T r. at 596A-97A , 1983A-84A. \"Complementary\" means that if a T nucleotide is the first base on the target DNA, the first base352 on the primer would be the T nucleotide's complement, the A nucleotide. Doctor Hepner called this a \"mirror image.\" Cedillo Pet. Ex. 120 at 9. 162When designing y, sequen cing the amplified DNA [the \"amplicon\"] to353 be generat ed, and then comparing th e sequence to a known sam ple o f the target subst ance , is th e best m ethod for de termining if the prime rs in th e assay are sen sitive enough. I f the labo ratory does not sequen ce th e target when designing, validating, an d optimizing the assa y, the lab orato ry cannot be certa in it is te sting exclusiv ely fo r the target su bstance. Ced illo T r. at 1945A. (2) Am plification . After se lection of the appropriate DNA p rimers, t he target DNA is d enatured (split by heat ing). A po lymerase is a dded, and two stra nds of DNA are then forme d from the original st rand. This is on e cycle in PCR. A second cycle incre ases the two strand s to four b y heating th e DNA t o ind uce splitting, an d reformin g each of the split stra nds by the added polymerase. A third cycle turns t he four st rands into eight, a nd the proce ss proce eds expone ntially, norm ally through 20 to 40 cycles, in conventio nal, solutio n- base d PCR. Am plification is followed by runnin g the a mplicon in gels and com paring the bands. Ced illo T r. at 1941-42A. PCR can prod uce billions o f copies from one strand of DNA. Ce dillo T r. at 598A-99A . (3) Melt Curves. ma chine s can genera te a \"melt curve,\" w hich is t he temperature at which the two strand s of DNA th at have bee n amplified will brea k apart. Each segme nt of DNA ha s a sp ecific tem perature at which it wil l brea k apart, p roviding a good indica tion that the sequence being am plified is t he sequen ce so ught. If the unknown an d known samples h ave similar m elt cu rves, this is an indica tion that they are likely to be the same DNA se quence . Ced illo Res. T r. Ex. 12, slide 1 5, is a n example o f a melt cu rve. A melt cu rve should be confirmed with gel de tectio n, which com pares the size of the DNA mo lecule amplified with the size of the targete d sequence . Ced illo T r. at 1844-45. (4) Gel Det . The DNA prod uced through PCR a mplification is place d in wells at one end of an agarose gel. Cedillo T r. at 1976A-78 A. An electrical cu rrent is a pplied to the gel, w hich cause s the negativ ely- charged DNA to move through th e gel in la nes. DNA p ieces move through th e gel at different rate s, de pending on their size, with the smaller pie ces moving faster. A st ain is a dded to the gel, an d under ultraviolet light the piece s of DNA fluoresce , making the m visible. Ce dillo T r. at 600-01A. The result o f this p rocess is something that looks like a b ar cod e. The agarose gel conta ins a DNA stan dard \"ruler\" indicatin g how man y base pairs of DNA w ill reach a particular po int in the gel as a result of the elect rical current and their size. Since the approximate size (nu mber of base pairs) of the DNA ta rget piece is In PCR, an assay is the testing process. DORLAND'S at 166.353 163known, th e first step in determining if the prime rs are sp ecific to t he target se lected is to compare the bands in the gel to the ruler. I f the prod uct is t he correct size, the prime rs likely select ed the correct t arget. Ce dillo T r. at 601A. b. Real T ime PCR. Real t ime PCR is a technique f or am plifying and detectin g DNA in \"real tim e.\" Real tim e PCR perm its de tectio n of the target se quence as the sample is b eing amplified, withou t waiting fo r the amplified p roduct to be run on a gel an d permits quanitif ication of the amount of the target su bstance prese nt. See generally, T. Nolan , et. al., Quantificat ion o f mRNA using real-tim PROTOCOLS, 6) \"], filed a s Cedillo Re s. Ex. UU, T ab 7. In real tim e TaqMan PCR (th e type o f testing perf orme d at Unigene tics), as in conventio nal P CR, tw o primers a re use d, both designed sp ecifically for the targeted gene. Howev er, TaqMan PCR a lso use s a p robe that is com plem entary to one of the strand s of target DNA. Prob es are trea ted to be chem ically luminesce nt. If the target DNA is prese nt, the prob e will bind to it, an d lum inesce nce signals tha t the amplification proce ss is w orking. T he fluoresce nt signal p rovides a n additio nal le vel of confidence in the result of PCR am plification , because both the prime r and prob e sequence s must match the target DNA stra nd in ord er for the probe to fluoresce . Ced illo T r. at 609A; Nolan, Cedillo Re s. Ex. UU, T ab 7. The thresh old cycle [\"CT\"] is the first cy cle of amplification in which en ough DNA is prese nt to detect the fluoresce nce. The more target DNA available initia lly, the fewer the number of cycles necessa ry before a machin e can detect the fluoresce nce. Ced illo Tr. at 612A. By convention , no more than 40-45 P CR cy cles sho uld b e run on any sample. Cedillo T r. at 2000-02, 2039. In genera l, results at 35 cycles or be low are accep table.

The results o f TaqMan PCR a re more reliab le than conventio nal, solutio n-based PCR be cause of the addition al con firmatio n from the prob e, but TaqMan resu lts are not definitive. The probe may be d etecting cont aminatio n, or the fluoresce nce may be an artifact. Any prob lems with th e actual assay itself remain. Sequencing th e resu lts is the only me thod which can determine p recisely what was amplified. Cedillo T r. at PCR a lso pe rmits a determinatio n of the approximate amount of the target DNA se quence in th e unkno wn samples, b ased on the development of a standard curve. A st andard cu rve is d erived by taking a very clean sam ple o f a kn own quantity of the targete d gene tic sequen ce and diluting it a t various con centration s. PCR amplification is the n performe d. A curve, based on the results from various dilution s and the number of PCR cycl es required to produce a signal, is gene rated . The range o f the stan dard curve mu st be sufficiently broad so a s to include all po ssible conce ntrations t hat might be found in the unknown sam ples. By comp aring the results of an unknown sam ple a gainst th e sta ndard curve, the labo ratory can d etermine how 164much of the targete d gene tic sequen ce was prese nt initially . Page 10 of Cedillo Re s. Tr. Ex. 13 re flects a stan dard curve f or a gene a t various dilut ions a t factors of 10. When plotted against a sta ndard curve, the unknown sam ples sh ould be within t he ranges e stablished by the st andard cu rve. This ran ge is illustrated in th is exhibit by the black d ots. Cedillo T r. at 1987A-89 A. c. Con firmato ry Testing. PCR am plification of a gen etic se quence of base pairs do es not produce a result that can be directly v isualized. T he product ca nnot be examin ed microsco pically and then visually com pared to a kn own sam ple. Com paring th e bands on a gel with the standard ruler in co nvention al PCR m erely tells the investigator w hether the amplification prod uced a molecu le of the expecte d size. T o illustrat e, a person ca n determin e by touch th at a small grapef ruit on the table is sim ilar in siz e, sh ape, and texture to another fruit inside a paper bag, b ut ca nnot definitively state wheth er the fruit in the bag is a large o range o r a sm all grapef ruit.

Docto rs Ken nedy and Hep ner agreed that PCR resu lts can be affected by changes in t he study design, v ariation s in the PCR m achin ery, the specificity and sensitivi ty of the prime rs, an d by the use of unblinded sam ples. Cedillo T r. at 668-70, 818-24A (1) Qua lity of RNA Sa mples. The quality of the RNA sam ple is critical t o the validity of the test results. RNA is extremely f ragile and easily degraded . Ced illo T r. at 1841A. Tissue sa mples fresh-f rozen or forma lin-fixed. A fresh-f rozen sample is o ne that is pla ced in liquid nitrogen immediately upon biop sy.

Ced illo T r. at 1969A-70 . Time and temperature are b oth crucial in PCR. On ce th e primers a re de veloped, and the optimum temperature for the assay is estab lished, it is im porta nt to continu e to use that temperature and timing to e nsure consistent results.

A positive control is a sam ple containing th e target DNA, such as ce lls gr own in cultu re con tainin g the virus, or ot her tissue known to contain the virus, such as b rain tissu e from an SSPE victim. P ositive controls v erify whether the assays used are working prope rly. The positive con trol m ust always test p ositive f or the presen ce of the virus.

The Uhlma nn paper be gan by recap ping Dr. W akefield's f indings of ILNH in children with autism and his hypothe sis tha t the ILNH represen ted the persistence of a viral ant igen at sites o f ILNH. The authors n oted that \"prelimina ry\" immunohistoch emical da ta su ggested that the measles virus w as presen t in the lymphoid tissue . The paper de scribed the molecu lar biolo gic techniques used to356 The reference in the paper to immunohistochemistry is somewhat ambiguous regarding when356 and where the immunohistochemistry was done. The Unigenetics lab, which provided the data from which the Uhlmann paper was drawn, did not use immunocytochemistry or immunohistochemistry. Cedillo Tr. at 650-52A; Snyder Tr. at 848A-49A, 914A-16A. If the paper's reference was to previous 169detect a nd measure measle s virus in t he terminal ileu m of children with IL NH and developm ental diso rders. 357 Biopsies f rom 91 case children and 70 developm entally normal co ntrols were teste d and compared. Positive con trols f or measle s virus RNA includ ed tissue from two cases of SSP E and from measles virus-infe paraffin tissue blocks were u sed as so urces o f RNA. The paper covered t he steps use d in testin g the RNA by Ta qMan PCR. Prim ers and prob es were de signed f or regions o f the measle s virus N, H, a nd F genes; Southern blo t analysis was used to co nfirm spe cificity of the prob es; P CR d using the TaqMan reverse tran scription reagent s with appropriate controls, includin g no-tem plate and no amplification controls; an d quan titative m easu reme nts were m ade using sta ndard curves. In situ P CR w as also pe rforme d. 358 The authors rep orted that 75 of the 91 case children had measle s virus in t heir ileal lympho id tissue , com pared to only five of the control children . TaqMan PCR testin g found positive resu lts for measle s virus in 7 0 of the 91 case children tested, albeit at low copy numbers in m ost ca ses. Only fo ur of the 70 control children tested positive f or measle s virus, wi th all of the positive findings com ing from control sam ples obtained during app endectomies. No measles virus w as detected in norma l children or children with isola ted ILNH. In situ PCR te sting f ound that 42 of 57 tissue biop sies were positive f or the N gene; four sa mples were incon clusiv e, and 11 were n egative. One of the five control children with norma l bowel mu cosa had detecta ble N gen e RNA p resen t. The virus was found in DC and som e lymph ocytes. In co mparing Ta qMan and in situ PCR te sting, the resea rchers ob taine d some immunohistochemical testing of samples at the Royal Free Hospital, Dr. Chadwick's testimony indicated that this testing could not be replicated by other researchers. Cedillo Tr. at 2288-89A. See also Iizuka, Cedillo Res. Ex. BB, Tab 46 (finding that the measles-related antigen found in the intestine of Crohn's disease patients by Dr. Wakefield was derived from human protein, not measles virus). The witnesses used the terms \"immunohistochemistry\" and \"immunocytochemistry\" in referring to the same method of testing for viruses. The terms are interchangeable. Snyder Tr. at 935A. The Uhlmann paper described the use of several techniques for testing samples for the357 presence of measles virus: (1) solution-based RT PCR, which Dr. Rima characterized as a standard technology; (2) in situ RT PCR, which he characterized as an experimental technology that was not properly developed; and (3) TaqMan PCR. Cedillo Tr. at 613A-14, 650-52A; Snyder Tr. at 848A-49A, 914A-16A. The Uhlmann study also involved the collection of gastrointestinal tissue by biopsy and the358 amplification of DNA directly in the tissue, rather than extracting the DNA from the tissue and conducting the amplification in a test tube. This is known as \"in situ\" PCR. Cedillo Tr. at 613A-16A. 170discorda ough 5 6 biopsies were e xamined using bo th techn iques, th e359 authors rep orted that con corda nt results were ob taine d in 42 samples (3 7 positive in both and five negative in bo th).

The authors co nclud ed that their da ta co nfirmed an asso ciation between the prese nce of measle s virus an d gut p athology in ch ildren with de velopmental disorde rs. b. Doctor He pner's Analysis of the Uhlm ann Paper. Doctor He pner testif ied that, based on the Uhlm ann paper, the Unigenet ics laboratory used appropriate PCR te chniques, prop erly performe d PCR am plification of the extracted RNA, u sed appropriate positive and negative con trols, a nd, therefore, obtained reliab le resu lts. Ced illo T r. at 616A-23A . Based on the high cop y numbers of measles virus RNA f ound in some of the sam ples, she conclu ded that the positive findings were not artifacts a nd represe nted actual virus de tectio n. Cedillo T r. at 642. Doctor K ennedy testif ied that, at least with th e high copy num ber resu lts, he considered the Unigenet ics' results to be reliable . Snyder T r. at 345-46A, 385A. Unigenetics' u se of known positive and negativ e samples pro vided one level of control. As Dr. Hepn er explaine d the concep t, if a negative contro l teste d positive, there was either a flaw in th e experim ental de sign or con taminatio n. A flaw in th e experimen tal design m ight result f rom using prime rs tha t were not specific to t he target. Cedillo T r. at 618A-19A . A second level of control involv ed the of experime ntal atien ts idiopathic b disea ed developm entally normal ch ildren. Both group s had biopsies of gastrointe stinal t issue t ested by Unigenet ics. Acco rding to Dr. Hep ner, the standard labo ratory practice sh ould involv e the sim ultan eous test ing of sam ples o f the control group a nd the experime ntal group. Ced illo T r. . Doctor He pner discusse d the Uhlm ann paper in so me detail. B ased on the360 paper, sh e asserted that, in their convention al PCR te sting, the labo ratory's positiv e \"Discordant results\" refers to a single sample testing both positive and negative for the359 measles virus, on different runs using the same primer, or on runs using different primers. Primers are specific to the gene being sought. A sample that tests positive for one measles gene, but negative for another, should not be reported as positive for the presence of measles virus. Cedillo Tr. at 672. If one gene test is positive, but the other is negative, the likelihood that the virus was actually present is considerably more doubtful. Cedillo Tr. at 1961A-62A. During Dr. Hepner's testimony, the Uhlmann paper was identified as Cedillo Pet. Ex. 63, Tab360 U. It was also filed as Cedillo Pet. Ex. 61, Tab GGGG. The Uhlmann paper was referenced by several of the experts, and, thus, it was filed as an attachment to each report. For consistency, I use the Cedillo Pet. Ex. 61, Tab GGGG, designation. 171control w as co nsisten tly positive and the \"no-te mplate\" co ntrol was con sistent ly negative. T he varied results f or prese nce of the virus, a nd the different cop y numbers obtained, indicate d that the experimen tal design w as appropriate and working prop erly. Cedillo Tr. at 622A-23A . Con firmato ry testing by South ern b lot gave her co nfidence that the targeted gene was being am plified b ecau se th e Southern blot prod uced a molecule of the pred icted size. Cedillo T r. at 624A. She used Figure 2 (A) of the Uhlm ann paper, which sh owed the bands produced by gel ele ctroph oresis, t o demonstrate that the positive results f or measle s virus w ere reliable. The first seven lan es of the gel (lanes 1-7) in Figure 2 (A) involv ed prime rs testin g for the measle s virus F gene . The next seven lan es (lan es 8-14) ref lected tests for the measle s virus H gene . According to Dr. Hepn er, te sting f or two genes, both with positive results, enhanced the reliability of the positive test resu lts for measle s virus Lanes 1 and 2 represe nted positive contro ls, on e from measles in fected-Vero cells an d one from the brain tissue of an SSP E victim.

Ced illo T r. at 624A-26A .361 Doctor He pner's conclusio n was tha t the resu lts from the Uhlm ann stud y were valid (Ced illo T r. at 626A), bu t she ackn owledged that other la bs were un able to reprod uce Dr. Uhlma nn's f indings.

H. Kawashima, Cedillo Res. Ex. T, Tab 18. 362 PBMCs are the lymphocytes, macrophages, and dendritic cells that remain in blood after the363 removal of red blood cells, platelets, and neutrophils from peripheral blood. Measles virus (wild-type and vaccine strain) can infect all types of the PBMCs in vitro, and presumably in vivo as well. Cedillo Tr. at 1848. The Kawashima study was performed in Japan, but all of the case children (those with autistic364 enterocolitis) were from the U.K., presumably from samples provided by Dr. Wakefield. Kawashima, Cedillo Res. Ex. T, Tab 18, at 726. Doctor Chadwick's declaration indicated that Dr. Wakefield had invited 172HIV. After PCR te sting, the gene products were seque nced for spe cific regions of the measles virus H and F gene s.

Proble ms with th e Uhlm ann and Kawashima Papers. Critici sms of the Uhlm ann and Kawashima papers a bound, both in the published literatu re, and in the testimo ny and reports in th e Theory 1 test ca ses. The prima ry criticism involv ed the inab ility of other rchers to duplicate their results. O ther criticisms includ ed issues co ncern ing the specif icity of the prime rs and prob es, the failure t o use blinded sam ples, evidence of contaminatio n, and data omitted from the papers. See, e.g., Cedillo T r. at 653; 1846-48; Ce dillo at 2-3. Petitione rs' experts ackn owledged that som e criticisms were valid, bu t con tended that the resu lts were, neverthe less, reliab le. 365 (1) Ina bility to Duplicate Results. If correct, the results from the Uhlm ann and Kawashima papers would work a sea chan ge in m easle s virology , with signif icant implications for the diagnosis an d possib le trea tment of both autism and gastroin testin al dise ase. Howev er, th d a number of epidem iologic studie s tha t failed to detect an y connection between measle s virus or m easle s vaccine an d inflammatory bow el diso rders or autism. Therefore, it was not su rprising that a number of labo ratories a ttempted to duplicate t heir resu lts. Doct or W ard p rovided testimony abou t his o wn rese arch efforts a nd findings.

Cedillo Tr. at 653-54. 173(a) Doctor W ard's Rese arch T eam's Efforts. Doctor W ard's group initially attempted to duplicate the Uhlm ann stud y, but electe d to use PBMCs rath er than gut biop sy tissue , based ethical con cerns a bout performin g endo scopie s and gut b iopsies on autistic children when the tests were n ot medically necessa ry. Because the Kawashim a paper involved th rough p eriphe ral bloo d from the gut to the brain, they used PMBCs f or their first stud y.

The autistic children who provided blood samples for this study had a high level of366 gastrointestinal complaints, as compared to the control children, but the threshold for reporting such complaints included relatively mild symptoms. Cedillo Tr. at 1899A-1902A. If measles virus persists in children with ASD, it should be present in PBMCs. Both Drs.367 Kawashima and Bradstreet purportedly found measles virus genomic material in the PBMCs of one of the three children tested. J.

Doctor Kinsbourne testified that if measles virus is replicating in the gut and causing inflammation, immune cells are responding to the inflammation and some will be infected. Immune cells move throughout the body, carrying the replicating virus in their cytoplasm. If measles virus is getting to the brain from the gut, it moves between them via the bloodstream. Cedillo Tr. at 1139, 1142. See also Cedillo Tr. at 1847-51 (Dr. Ward's testimony explaining why PBMCs were an appropriate substitute for gut tissue). Y. D' Souza, et al., No Evidence of Persisting Measles Virus in Peripheral Blood Mononuclear368 Cells From Children With Autism Spectrum Disorder, PEDIATRICS 118(4): 1664-75 (2006). Doctors Fombonne and Ward were co-authors on this study. 174Doctor He pner's critici sms were a nswered in t he secon d D'So uza pap er. This369 study used gut t issue, the Uhlm ann and Kawashima prime rs, an d the same proce dures as th e Uhlm ann and Kawashima investigators. It also involv ed the use of F gene probes, d eveloped by Dr. W ard's lab orato ry, and sequencing of the prod uct o f the PCR proce sses. When Dr. W ard's group teste d the Uhlm ann prime rs on gut tissue , they obta ined results sim ilar to Dr . Uhlm ann, includ ing similar cop y numbers. However, only some of those sa mples ha d appropriate melt cu rves, a nd none had bands in the appropriate lo cation during the gel e lectrop horesis of the F or H gene s. 370 Two of 17 had appropriate bands when the N gene assay w as performe d. When the results were sequen ced, the results were co mpatible with various m ammalian gene s, includin g a hu man gene , but not measle s virus. Ce dillo T r. at 1859-61, 1909A-12A.

Non e of the sam ples p roduced using the Kawashima H gene prime r teste d positive by nested PCR. 371 The melt curves indicat ed the amplification was not sp ecific to t he targets. This cause d many of the sam ples t o \"fall ou t\" of the group o f potentially positive resu lts. When the DNA f ragmen ts were run o n a gel, m any of the remaining sam ples were negative. Howev er, in three of the 42 children with ASD (as co mpared to none of the 17 controls), the test results rema ined positive after th e gel. I f Dr. W ard a nd his resea rchers ha d sto pped at this poin t, they would have rea ched conclusions similar to those in Dr. Kawashima 's stud y. Howev er, Dr. W ard's lab orato ry used a slightly different techno logy for de tectin g the e nd products, and then sequence d the gene s from the positive resu lts. Upo n sequencing, a ll of the gene products, obtained by using the Uhlm ann F, N, o r H prime rs, turne d out to be human genes, not measle s virus genes. No m easle s virus geno mic m aterial w as found. Cedillo T r. at 1850-53. The sequen cing results d emonstrated a problem with th e primers.

Doctor Ward was a co-author. Doctor Hepner agreed that the lack of band specificity meant that the primers were amplifying370 cDNA from something other than the measles virus. Cedillo Tr. at 644-45. Nested PCR involves a PCR reaction performed on material previously amplified by PCR,371 using one set of primers for the first reaction and another set of primers for the second reaction.

In 1999, Dr. Afzal had published a letter in GUT, responding to a proposal that gene373 amplification and sequencing might provide a definitive answer to the measles-IBD theory. The letter referenced \"several published studies\" by both his team and \"the IBD study group who formulated the original measles hypothesis\" that indicated PCR had been used to examine biopsies from Crohn's disease patients, looking for the N, F, and H genes, all with negative results.

In 2001, the Afzal group published a letter to the editor of Digestiv e Disea ses and Scien ces th at was highly critical of its 20 00 publication of the Kawashim a article. 375 The letter com mented that other research ers w ho had failed to find m easle s virus in biopsies an d PBMC of patients with IB D had used \"more rob ust a nd sensitive m ethods than the method applied b y Kawashim a.\" Id. at 658. It also noted anomalies in th e gene se quencing da ta provided by Kawashima when com pared with the vaccine strain virus, in a dditio n to noting sequen ce variations in the same sam ple a mplified by different processes.

See Part F.2.b .(1), supra . In respo nse, Dr. Oldsto ne with Drs. W akefield nd O'Lea ry to Dr. W ard. Acco to Dr. W ard, Dr.382 Oldsto ne was approache d about a collabo ration with Dr. O'L eary, but , before h e would agree to collab orate , he wanted to ascertain the O'Le ary labo ratory's ability to detect reliably mea sles vir us. He th erefore p repared tissue a nd cell cultu res at various levels of infection , and sent blinded sam ples t o the O'L eary laborat ory. After th e lab orato linded the specime ns and determin ed that the labo ratory results w ere o nly abou t 80% accu rate, includ ing abo ut 10% p ositive results. Snyder T r. at 952A-56A . According to Dr. W ard, this resu lt would be unaccept able in a resea rch set ting, an d was w ildly inap propriate f or a diagnost ic lab, such as Unigene tics. Ced illo T r. at 1846; Snyder T r. at 956A. Doctors O ldston e and O'Lea ry agreed to try again, and Dr. Oldsto ne prepared another set o f sam ples. After te sting, the results were jo intly unblind ed, with a similar level of inaccu racy of arou nd 20%. Some of the sam ples t hat were false p ositives or false n egatives in the first round of testing w ere resu bmitted in th e second roun d with new code numbers. I n several inst ance s, sam ples t hat tested as positive during the first round tested negative in th e second , and vice v ersa. At that point, Dr. O ldston e decid ed against a ny fu rther co llabora tion, and suggested publishin g the re sults. However, the stud y's spon sor w ould not grant p ermission for pu blication . Snyder T r. at 957-58A. Altho ugh it is p ossible that con taminatio n of the sam ples occu sition a dvanced by Dr. Kenn edy, Dr. W ard d iscoun ted that possibility . He noted that Dr. Oldst one was co nside red a meticulo us scien tist, with Because Dr. Oldstone did not testify, I considered this evidence to be less reliable than the381 other evidence that challenged the O'Leary laboratory's findings. However, Dr. Ward's testimony about his conversations with Dr. Oldstone substantiated other evidence that Unigenetics' results were not reliable, and for that reason, I considered it relevant. I also note that petitioners' counsel elicited similar hearsay from Dr. Kennedy, concerning his conversations with Dr. Sheils (see Snyder Tr. at 331A-36A), to establish the reliability of Unigenetics. Hearsay is permissible under the relaxed evidentiary standards in Vaccine Act cases. See \u00a7 300aa-12(d)(2)(B). Doctor Oldstone's experience with Unigenetics was also recounted in evidence presented to Congress in 2001. See Autism - Why the Increased Rates? A One- Year Update: Hearings before the Committee on Government Reform, 107 Cong. 29 (2001) at 174-75 (testimony of Dr. Michael Gershon regarding Dr. Oldstone's testing of Unigenetics' ability to detect measles virus by PCR) (available at frwebgate.access.gpo.gov/cgi- bin/getdoc.cgi?dbname=107house_hearings&docid=f:76856.pdf) (last visited January 22, 2009). After conversing with Dr. Oldstone about the aborted collaboration with Dr. O'Leary, Dr. Ward382 sent his notes to Dr. Oldstone. Thereafter, Dr. Oldstone wrote a letter, filed as Snyder Res. Ex. AA, setting forth his recollections of the events. Snyder Tr. at 962A. Petitioners objected to the portion of Dr. Oldstone's letter that set forth his opinion on vaccine causation of autism as an untimely filed additional expert report, but did not otherwise object to the letter. Snyder Tr. 11-12. 180a 50-year track record of high quality and high imp act p ublicat ions. Snyder T r. at 959. Doctor K ennedy also su ggested the misident ified sa mples were proba bly at the low end of the detectio n thresho ld (Snyder T r. at 337A-39A ), but his e xplanation did not acco unt for false p ositive results n or ho w the sam e samples cou ld test po sitive initia lly, but negative w hen submitted a second time, or vice versa. Sn yder T r. at 960A-62A . Doctor G riffin sum med up the criticisms when she testif ied that the repu tation of the O'Le ary labo ratory in the scient ific com munity w as \"no t very good. \" Cedillo T r. at 2866. The evidence that Unigene tics w as not reliably detect ing me asles virus is highly probative. T he lack of specificity in th e F gen e primers a nd the resulta nt amplification of DNA f rom source s oth er than the measle s virus, th e discordan t resu lts for H an d N genes, the failure t o sequence the results from the F gene positives, a nd the inab ility of other lab orato ries to reprod uce its results all cast consid erable do ubt on the reliability of Unigenetics' rep orts. Therefore, base d on evidence not derived from the U.K. litigation materials, I conclude that Unigene tics' repo rts can not be considered at face value and are e ntitled to little evident iary weight, a bsen t som e ind ication that a specif ic test result is corrobo rated by evi dence from source s oth er than Unigenetics. I address ad dition al problems with Colte n's Unigene tics test results in Se ction VIII, below. e. The U.K. MMR Litigation Data . Respo ndent filed a number of documents and expert reports con tainin g informa tion derived f rom the U.K. MMR li tigation, includin g the e xpert report of Dr. Pet er Simm onds, two reports b y Dr. Bust in, and a repo rt by Dr. Rima. In addition ,383 384 385 some of the testimony of Dr. Bust in an d Dr. Rima was derived from informa tion they acquired in the course of that litigation. As a part of the U.K. litigation , Dr. Bu stin was given access to all of the raw data underlying the Uhlma nn paper as well as t he informa tion on the assa ys carried o ut for the U.K . litigants. Doctor Rim a was also provided a ccess to background materials regarding testing. At the request o f the U.K. court, Dr. Bust in con ducted a review of the Unigenet ics laboratory, w hich in volved an examin ation of data underlying their resu lts an d two site visits. Aske d to sum marize his chief concerns, Dr. Bustin testified that there was386 His report was filed as Snyder Res. Ex. P.383 His June 2003 report was filed as Snyder Res. Ex. Q. His November 2004 report was filed as384 Snyder Res. Ex. R. Doctor Rima's report was filed as Snyder Res. Ex. S. 385 Doctor Bustin testified that he was approached by attorneys for GlaxoSmithKline in June or386 July of 2003, who asked him to look at the Uhlmann paper and some of the documentation provided by Dr. O'Leary and Unigenetics in response to discovery requests in the U.K. litigation. He was told he was a \"Court witness,\" rather than a partisan advocate, and he approached his analysis of the evidence in that 181clear evidence that the lab orato ry was detecting a DNA co ntaminant, not measle s virus RNA. He therefore co nclud ed that there was no measle s virus in a ny of the case samples t hat Unigenet ics teste d. Cedillo T r. at 2035-36. His te stimo ny fu rther d etailed the reaso ns he believed th e lab orato ry could no t reliab ly repo rt the prese nce of measles virus RNA in tissue , blood, or CSF. Doctor Rim a shared Dr. Bust in's op inion. He f latly stated that he had no confidence in the results from the Unigenet ics labo ratory. Snyder T r. at 846A. His criticisms of the Unigenet ics labo ratory w ere b ased on evidence he found ind icating carelessn ess a nd on practice s he accep table as a scien tist.\" Sn yder T r. at 927A. Doctor Rim a ide ntified h is top three problem s with th e Unigene tics labo ratory: (1) repo rting discordan t resu lts as a h e characte rized as with norma l ic proce dure; (2) f ailing to o ptimize the F gen e assay; and (3) PCR u nder li tigation e stablished that Unigene tics experience prob lems com monly encou ntered in PCR te sting, an d that it failed to take adequate measure s to detect a nd correct th em. In addition to the problems in th e primers u sed to se lect th e amplification target a ddressed by Dr . Ward, other prob lems with th e primers were discovered. Unigenet ics had prob lems in RNA extraction a nd qua lity, inte rnal co to Un igenetics' own SOP , unblinde d testing tha t permitte d data manipulatio n, and a critical p roblem with co ntamination . Some of the data discovered du ring Dr . Bustin's revi ew sugg ested a fraudulent manipulatio n of labo ratory note books an d machine settings. Oth er evidence genera ted during the U.K . litigation d emonstrated anew that Unigene tics' results co uld n ot be rep roduced. Alth ough t here was te stimo ny that Unigene tics sequen ced some of the cDNA ob taine d through PCR, n o resu lts of sequen cing have ever bee n Unigenetics a ttempted to use allelic discrimina tion to identify strain measle s virus ithou t seque ncing; Dr. Rima 's examina tion of underlyi ng dat a ind resu lts of their allelic discrimina tion h igh copy num ber resu lts were n ot a reliable indicat or of measle s virus in t he samples re porte d. (1) Qu ality of Samples. Doctor B ustin assesse d the Unigene tics pract ice wi th regard to quality and light. Cedillo Tr. at 1962A-64A. He was granted access to the Unigenetics laboratory in January and May, 2004. Cedillo Tr. at 1964A. He analyzed the raw data files from Unigenetics, an operation that involved about 1500 hours of work. He looked at all the notebooks disclosed in the course of the litigation, statements from all the Unigenetics laboratory workers, the expert witness reports filed by Drs. O'Leary and Sheils, all of the operator sheets produced during discovery, all the experimental reports produced, and the laboratory's SOP. Cedillo Tr. at 1964A-68A. In addition, he analyzed the data files directly on Unigenetics' own computers. Cedillo Tr. at 1965A-66A. I found Dr. Bustin to be a candid, forthright, and compelling witness. 182quantity assessm ent of RNA in sa mples as incon sistent . He found very little quality assessm ent was performe d. Even w hen quality assessm ent was done, it was of ten done improperly, resu lting in the testing of sam ples t hat should h ave bee n discarded . Data from the Uhlm ann paper in dicate d that, in ap proximate ly one-third o f the sam ples teste d, the RNA quality was unacce ptable Ce dillo T r. at 1996-97. In analyz ing the materials p roduced, Dr. Bust in no ted that Unigene tics' repo rted comparison s of the quant ity of RNA prod uced from forma lin-fixed tissue versus f resh- frozen tissue were gen erally appropriate. It took approximately 25 cycles to p roduce a specif ic am ount of RNA (the \"copy ber\") f rom fresh-f rozen tissue samples a nd about 35 to 45 cycles to prod uce it from forma lin-fixed samples. These results indicat ed that there was ap proximate ly 200-300 tim es less of the target RNA in the forma lin sam ples t han in th e fresh sa mples. Do ctor Bu stin illustrat ed this d ifference in Cedillo Res. Tr. Ex. 13 a t 5. Howev er, when h e analyz ed the results from a specific cont rol sam ple387 amplified b y the labo ratory, the copy num bers f rom fresh-f rozen tissue and forma tissue were n ot noticea bly diff erent. The cycle nu mbers w ere the same, in spite of the presu med lower quality of the DNA in t he forma lin-fixed sample. This an omalous result in dicate d that whate ver was being am plified in the forma lin-fixed sample was a contaminant intro duce d after th e fixation . Ced illo T r. at 1971A-73 . The RNA extraction p hase is crucial to the results beca use the quality of the RNA de termines t he results. Poor quality RN A will result in low copy numbers; h igh quality RNA w ill result in h igher copy num bers. Unigenet ics oste nsibly applied two quality control m easu res. T he first check involv ed looking at the ratio of two optica l densities, which cou ld ide ntify contaminants in t he RNA sam ple. Unfortun ately, this test was not routine ly performe d. The other quality assessm ent method involv ed the measu reme nt of GAP DH, a cellular ref erence gene , detecta ble if the RNA is of good quality . Every cell in t he human body expresses t his gene and, thus, it can be used to determine wheth er an RNA extraction a ctually contains RNA. If the reference gene cannot be detecte d, the sample sh ould not be analyzed, because there is no RNA prese nt. Unigenet ics' laboratory SOP a cknowledged th is principle by stating tha t if GAP DH w ere n ot presen t, the sam ple sh ould not be analyzed. Howev er, lab orato ry personn el did analyze samples where t he reference gene could no t be detecte d. When positive resu lts for the F gene were o btained from samples with no detecta ble G APDH, th e resu lts ref lected contaminant, not 1978A-79A 2054. Additiona the conversion of ha d hallma rks of \"ope rator e rror,\" as th e conversion ste p was som etimes skipp ed, rend ering any results u seless. During Dr. Bustin 's rev iew of the Unigenet ics labo ratory data , he began to think tha t the The control sample was from an SSPE patient.387 183positive labo ratory results f or measle s virus gene s were the result o f contaminatio n, rathe r than the actual prese nce of the virus in t he unkn own sam ples. His slides, Ce dillo Res. T r. Ex. 13 a t 8-9, reflected Unigenet ics labo ratory data that demonstrat ed the reverse t ranscription step had not been performe d. The results o n page 9 of this e xhibit indicat ed that in four o f the lead case s in th e U.K . litigation, the labo ratory fa iled to perform reverse t ranscription . The positive results could not have come from the patient samples b ecau se any RNA presen t in them was not co nverted t o DNA. Beca use PCR can not amplify RNA, whatever w as amplified had to be a contaminant introd uced in th e lab orato ry. Ced illo T r. at 1980A-82 . (2) Prime rs. As noted in Part G .5.d., above, Unigene tics' F gene prime r was not su fficiently specif ic. During Dr. Bust in's examin ation of Unigenet ics' data in th e U.K . litigation, he discovered a nother issu e with the prime rs. T he laboratory used prime rs for bo th the F and H genes and attempted to optimize the ir assays f or bo th, with th e goal o f developin g concord ant results. Unigene tics found that the H gene a ssay w as m uch more sen sitive than the F gene assa y. In testing the same tissu e, on some occa sions they obtaine d positive results f or the F gen e, but obtained negativ e resu lts on the more sensitive assa y for the H gene . Faced with th is prob lem, the lab orato ry should h ave redesigned th e F gen e assay in orde r to h ave conco rdant resu lts. In stead, Un igenetics ignored t he negative H gene results, and repo rted only the positive F gene results. Cedillo T r. at 1985A-86 A. (3) Contro ls and Standards. Approximately one-th ird of Unigenet ics' runs h ad positive results for the negative controls, a result in dicative of a signif icant problem with co ntamination . In at least one case, an environm ental con trol (a tu be left open to the air in th e lab orato ry) teste d positive, a strong ind icator t hat the labo ratory itself was co ntaminated. Cedillo T r. at 1995-96. The conce rns Dr. Bu stin d eveloped about contaminatio n at Unigene tics w ere heighte ned when he visited the labo ratory and discovered t hat the PCR po rtion o f the laboratory w as next to a room labe led \"Pla smid Room .\" Plasm ids are DNA m olecu les used to replicate large quant ities of DNA in a bacterium . These bacteria o ffer massive potential for DNA con taminatio n, and standard scient ific practice would be to place the plasm id facility as far from the PCR lab orato ry as p ossible. Plasmid s get on to hair, hands, a nd clothe s, an d are ea sily transferred t hroughout the facility , and erad icate. Alth ough Dr. S heils a ssured Dr. Bust in that they did n ot use th e plasm id roo m for grow ing F gene t argets, h e rem ained concern ed it was th e source o f the contaminatio n he already had iden tified in the assa ys. Ced illo T r. at 2021-23. Another issue id entified b y Dr. Bust in con cerne d the failure o f Unigenet ics perso nnel to follow their own SOP. Docto r Ken nedy concurred in the importan ce g and followi ng experime nt, particu larly when 184PCR results a re use d in diagnosis. He te stified that any variation s from the SOP should be recorde d in detail, includ ing the reaso ns for the variation. Ced illo T r. at 818. Unigenetics p erson nel failed to do this. The TaqMan p robe contains a fluoresce nt label. In addition t o this fluoresce nce, a reference dye (called ROX) is adde d to each tu be to ensure correct p ipetting of the sample. The PCR instrum ent recognizes ROX and co mpensa tes for vary ing quantities of the substance. Docto r Bustin examin ed the ratio of the fluoresce nt probe to the ROX dy e in the react ion tubes. If the investigator place d the same amount of prob e into each tube, ROX am ounts sho uld b e rou ghly the sam e across th e plate. Ced illo T r. at 2024-25A. The chart at Re s. Ced illo T r. Ex. 13 a t 19, indicated that, in 18 wells, twice as much probe was added than in the rem aining wells becau se th e ratio of prob e to ROX dy e was increase d in those 18 wells fro m approximately .65 t o 1.3. This incorrect p ipetting w as just one example o f many deviations from the lab's o wn SOP found by Dr. Bust in. S uch deviations lead to incon sistent results. Ced illo T r. at 2025A- 26. To quan tify the amount of measle s virus in a ny given sample, Unigenetics develope d a stan dard curve. T he \"CT\" (som etimes ref erred t o as \"Ct\") num ber o n data generat ed to su pport quant ification represe nted the number o f cycles of amplification performe d before d etecting the target gen e. The lower the amount of the target gen e in the sam ple, the higher th e number o f cycles required before gett ing a po sitive rea ding. Beca use the unknowns ref lected on Cedillo Re s. Tr. Ex. 13 a t 10 were n ot within th e parameters o f the stan dard curve, it w as im possib le to quant ify the amount of F gene in these unkno wn samples, a nd a copy num ber sh ould not have been repo rted.

At a tenfold d ilution (the secon d black do t), the cycle num ber was 18 ; at another tenfold dilution , the thresho ld cycle w as 21. Cedillo T r. at 1989A-91 A. All of the unknown samples in this e xhibit a ppear to the left of the last d ata point on the sta ndard curve. They w ere a ctually out of range a nd the labo ratory should not have rep orted any quantity of measle s virus. Ce dillo T r. at 1991A. The standard curve at Ce dillo Res. Tr. Ex. 13 a t 11, illustrate d the difficulty Unigenetics e ncou ntered in amplifying low copy numbers. O ne of the known sta ndards was signif icantly diluted , and after 45 cycles of amplification , the lab orato ry was unable to detect the presen ce of virus un der o ptimal con dition s. This ind icated that the assay was working very poorly, and thus th e quan tification s of the other sam ples in this ru n were m eaningless. Ced illo T r. 1994-95. If less th an 20,000 copies of the target F gen e existed in t he teste d material, Unigenet ics w as unable to amplify DNA. Ce dillo T r. at 1992-94. 185(4) Unblind ed Testing. Proble ms from the use of unblinde d data were illustrat ed in the way Unigenet ics handled settings on t heir PCR m achin es. An examp le of the results from one of their machine s is sho wn on Ced illo Res. T r. Ex. 13 a t 12. The fluoresce nce thresh old is t he line run ning f rom left to right across th e middle of the graph. The first cy cles (on the far left side of the graph) con taine d ran dom \"noise ,\" and, therefore, the manufacturer recom mended that the first three cycles be exclude d from analysis. Be ginning at a bout cycle 17 and continu ing to a bout cycle 26, four cu rves appear, su pplemented by red lines. These lines a re virtually parallel, ind icating tha t sim ilar am plification of the target occurred . Becau se th ey are similar, the copy numbers can be reliably comp ared. These are samples co ntaining mo re of the target. A very well-designed assa y would demonstrat e line ar results, but with higher numbers o f cycles, the assay beco mes less e fficient. This was ref lected by the two red lines o n the far right of the graph in Cedillo Re s. Tr. Ex. 13 a t 12. Ced illo T r. at 2001- 05. The curves on the far right side o f the graph t hat failed to reach the fluoresce nce thresh old were record ed as negatives, a su bjective asse ssme nt. If the rves co ntained d gene , they were false n egatives. If they were \"no -template \" cont rols, som ething in the negativ e control was be ing am plified and should h ave bee n rep orted as p ositive. T his exam ple illustra tes the role th at subje ctive analysis prope rly plays in inte illo roperly. It set the thresh old cycle of its m achin es in what Dr. Bust in called \"a very peculiar w ay,\" sometimes using the manufacturer's guidelines a nd sometimes not. Cedillo T r. at 2005. An examp le of a Un igenetics p rintou t from their ABI 7 700 machin e is f ound at Cedillo Res. Tr. Ex. 13 a t 13. The printo ut reflects th e use of the ABI stan dards, with the baseline starting at number 3 and going up t o 15. The red a nd green lines re flect results f rom two different sam ples, with th e red line sa mple crossing th e thresho ld at 33 cycles an d the green line cro ssing the thresh old a t 37 cycles. Cedillo T r. at 2005-06. If no subjective ana lysis w ere a pplied to these resu lts, bo th would b e rea d as positive. Howev er, th e curves ref lected very different slop es. The red line showed an appropriate curve; the green line wobbled u p and down at the threshold . After examinin g this result, a blinded reviewer w ould have conclud ed the sam ple re flected by the green line should n ot be rea d as positive. Unigenetics re porte d both sam ples a s positive. Unigene tics frequent ly repo rted positive results from samples t hat should have be en read as n egative. Cedillo T r. at 2005-07. Unigenetics' p ractice o n rep orting discorda nt results f rom the sam e sample was decid edly unu sual. It is st andard p ractice t o test sam ples a t least twice. If the results are gen uine, they will be th e same. If there are discrepa ncies, the test should b e repeated. Unigenetics ra n assays in dup licate a nd sometimes in triplicate, but in m any instan ces, t he results f or the F gen e were discorda nt, with one test positive an d one test negative, an d with dif ferent cycle num bers. Cedillo T r. o f one rep eated assay are d isplayed in t he slide a ppearing at p age 16 of Cedillo Re s. Tr. Ex. 13. The open bars ref lect th e assay run on March 2 1, 2003, and the solid b ars ref lect th e rep eated assay don e on March 26, 2003. Docto r Bustin noted the massive v ariability in the cycle numbers o btained on the different dates for the sam e samples. He pointed out that so me of the sam ples t ested positive on t he first run a nd negative on the seco nd, and vice v ersa. ics repo rted the sam ples t hat teste d positive on e ither d ay as po sitives, ignoring th e discordan t resu lts. Ced illo T r. at 2014. Doctor B ustin also t estified that an ABI 7700 machine used by Unigenet ics w as defective. T he heating block f or the ABI 7700 containe d 96 wells, perm itting the operator to run 96 assays at a time, but heating and cooling w ere n ot uniform across the block in these machine s. Fo r that reason, investigators aware of the heating problem do not use the outside wells. T he machine that was used on most o f Unigenetics' run s had huge variations in the heating an d cooling across t he block. Depe nding on where th e tube was placed , the temperatu re fluctua tions cause d variability in results beca use both reverse tran scription and PCR are sensitive to temperature. Unigene tics w as unaware of the prob lem with th e ABI 7700 machin es. Cedillo T r. at 1998-2000. (5) Evi dence Suggesting Fraud. Laborato ry notebooks are u sed to record what is d one in an experim ent, and are later u sed to wri te papers on the experime nt. Laboratory note books are generally available f or insp ection . In stan dard pract ice, n otebook entries are usua lly made relatively contemporaneously and a re no t, thereafter, ch anged . Ced illo T r. at 2026-27. During the course of the U.K. MMR li tigation, the sam e lab orato ry notebook was disclosed on two sepa rate occasio ns. Cedillo T r. at 2027. As ind icated in Ced illo Res. Tr. Ex. 13 a t 20, and in Dr. Bustin 's accom panying testim ony, the top labo ratory notebook page was disclosed at the earlier of the two occasion s. The secon d page, th e same notebook page as th e first, w as disclosed at a later time . It containe d parenthetical a dditio ns, sual.\" Cedillo T 2027-28. The secon d disclosed page co ntained the phrase \"A1 0 tipped,\" which re fers to the end of a pipette tip being brushe d against a reactio n vessel, th us putting a sm all bit of the react ion m ix into the wrong tub e. This would be a plausible explana tion for a false p ositive result, if made contemporaneously w ith th e event. The later a dditio n of this p arenthetical suggests som ething less be nign tha n such an error. T his was only one of several examp les of alteration s Dr. Bust in found in laboratory note books. 388 Cedillo T r. at 2028-32. Doctor Rima also observed this alteration, but it was the only alteration in a notebook of which388 he was aware. Snyder Tr. at 855A-56A. 187Another example of an alteration in a submitted docu ment was f ound in Cedillo Res. T r. Ex. 13 a t 21-22 (pa ge 22 is an enlarged version of a se gmen t of the document appearing on at 21). The docu ment liste d the date of the run, the experime ntal cond itions, what wells w ere u sed, and the nature of the substance in each well. Doct or Bustin de termined that each sa mple in t his run was a triplicate , with three wells use d for each sam ple. The wells (iden tified b y the lette r A, B , or C in the left colu mn) each had a number id entifying the sample in the left cen ter of the page. W ells B1 , B2, and B3 were a ll from Sample 1 (iden tified in the fourth colum n from the left). The fifth co lumn from the left indicated the results; the sixth co lumn ind icated the quant ity of the target subst ance . The entries in th e sixth colum n were roughly the sa me for ea ch group of three sam ples, confirming tha t the run was m ade in triplicat e. Cedillo T r. at 2029-31. Unigenetics su bmitted testing data for the U.K . litigants to the court with each case in the litigation assigned a unique n umber. When documents such as the page appearing on page 22 of Cedillo Re s. Tr. Ex. 13 were sub mitted as evidence, Unigenetics p erson nel would m ark th e resu lts relevant t o a particular litigant by boxing them in an d writing the litigant number ne xt to the result. In this p articular e xhibit, the results rele vant to wells C1 with a handwri tten \"# 8\" inside t he box, indica ting tha t these two wells pertain ed to Patien t Num ber 8 in th e litigation. 389 The handwritten notation \"viral cells 1/ 100\" was also written by Unig enetics pe rsonn ositive contro ls-cells kno wn to be infected with me asles virus at a 1/100 level of infection . The entry in co lumn three for these two wells is \"Positc,\" a n abbreviation for \"positive con trol.\" Be cause Dr. Bust in rece ived this docu ment from evidence relating to Patient Num ber 8 in th e U.K . litigation, he interp reted the entries as an attempt to repo rt the results from a positive contro l as a litigant's result. Cedillo T r. at 2031-32. In esse nce, Unigenet ics too k a co ntrol sa mple known to contain m easle s virus an d rep orted it as a litigant's sa mple, th e PCR testing equiv alent of \"plan ted evidence .\" The bottom slide o n Ced illo Res. T r. Ex. 13 a t 14 reflected another prob lem with Unigenetics's rep orting. T he base line o n slide B ref lected a range of 2-13 , rath er than the 3-15 range reco mmended by the m anufacturer. T he effect o f using th e altered range was to ch ange t he results f rom positive to negative. T his is signif icant, because the sam ple in question was a negativ e control. If it tested positive, su ggesting contaminatio n, it would raise d oubts as to the other results from the sam e run . Using the manufacturer's settings, a s Slide A of this e xhibit d emonstrated , the negative control sam ple sh ould have returned a positive resu lt. Ced illo T r. at 2008-10A. Altho ugh Dr. Bu stin sto pped short of saying the a lteratio n in the settings w as a delibe rate manipulation of the data, he testif ied that the unusua l settin gs were a matter of curiosity f or him , until he obtained access to the raw data, which sh owed this Doctor Bustin testified that he added brackets to the third column, reflecting the triplicate run in389 each bracket. He also added the handwritten arrow in the middle of the page and the large question mark next to the data from wells C1 and C2. Cedillo Tr. at 2031. 188particu lar sam ple was a n egative contro l. The clear im plication from his te stimo ny was that the raw data provided the motive to m anipulate the machin e settings, as a positive result f or a negative con trol ref lects a contaminatio n problem that sho uld ca use all of the sam ples f rom that run to be discarde d. Cedillo T r. at 2011A-12 . He added that whenever there was a hint of a positive result f or the F gen e in a sample, regardless of whether the curve suggested actual amplification , Unigene tics called the sam ple positive. Howev er, when t he sample was a n o-tem plate control th at sh ould have been read as p ositive, it w as either o mitted from the repo rt, or th e baseline s were a ltered to generat e the impression of a negative test. Cedillo T r. at 2012. (6) Reprod ucibility of Unigenet ics' Results in U.K. MMR Litigation . Several w itnesse s also testif ied a bout attempts within th e context of the U.K. MMR li tigation t o confirm Unigene tics' results. During the course of the U.K. litigation , the remaining quan tities o f Unigenet ics' sam ples were split b etween t he respo ndents and the claim ants and retested. Doctor S immonds rete sted sam ples f or the defendant drug panies an d Doct or Cott er rete sted sam ples f or the claim ants. Snyder T r. at 896A Accordin g to Drs. Bu stin a nd Rima, neither Dr. S immonds nor Dr. Cotter was able to find e vidence of measle s virus in t he claima nt sa mples. S nyder T r. at 895A- 897A. Accordin g to Dr. Ke nnedy, Dr. Sheils to ld him that Dr. Cott er con firmed the prese nce of measle s virus in t he high cop y number sam ples, but she did not provide him with th e data. Snyder T r. at 347A-49A . Doct or Ke nnedy indicate d that informa tion confirming this was in th e U.K . litigation f iles, which w ere st ill sealed . Snyder T r. at 349A-50A . Doctor B ustin testif ied that he and Dr. Cot ter, whom he described as a PCR expert, worked f or the same institu tion. Ced illo T r. at 1967A. Using the sam e type o f ABI machine used by Unigenet ics, Dr. Cotte r atte mpted to verify Dr. O'Le ary's results. Snyder T r. at 2015A. Using RNA tha t he persona lly extracted , Dr. Cott er pe rforme d PCR am plification s. In every insta nce where he used PCR that he extracted , Dr. Cott er obtained negative results. In using Unigenetics' extracted RNA, h e obtained positive results, shown on Slide 17 of Cedillo Re s. Tr. Ex. 13. The numbers a ppearing on that slide a re the thresho ld cycle (CT) nu mbers; red reflects p a nd green reflects n egative results. Cedillo T r. at 2015A-16 . All of Dr. Cotte r's ex traction s from the sam e sources h ad previously tested negative. T he results ref lected on this slide indicat ed two things. First, Dr. Cotte r's assay w as m ore se nsitive, beca use his cycle numbers were lower than Unigenet ics'. Se cond , because sam ples f rom these individuals te sted negativ e when Dr. Co tter e xtracte d the RNA, but positive when h e performe d testing on Unigenetics' e xtraction s from the sam e ind ividuals, Unigenet ics' samples were likely contaminate d. Cedillo T r. at 2016. It was ob vious f rom the slide and from Dr. Bustin 's testim ony tha t he had access to Dr. Cotte r's data , and did no t merely obtain his inf orma tion throu gh stimo ny abou t Dr. Cotte r's results was similar to that of Dr. Bust in, but less de tailed . Snyder T r. at 895A-97A . Doct or Sim monds' re port noted that the only tw o samples of PBMCs th at 189teste d positive f or measle s virus by Dr. Cotter were extractions performe d by Unigenetics, while th e correspon ding sam ples Dr. Co tter e xtracte d were ne gativ e. Snyder Res. Ex. P at 86-87. See also Cedillo Res. Ex. BB, Tab 23 (newspape r article reporting that the claim ants' retest ing expert w as unable to confirm Unigene tics' results). Base d on the testimo ny and reports, I co nclud e that the accou nts o f Drs. Bust in and Rima are more likely to reflect a ccurate ly Dr. Cotte r's ef resu lts. Howev er, becau se th e evidence is in conflict, an d Dr. Ke nnedy clearly asse rted that evidence containe d in the U.K. files w ould validate h is testim ony, in an abundance of caution, I have disregarded the testimony abou t Dr. Cott er's results. I emphasize that I am doing so wi th great relucta nce, in view of the fact that petitione rs have no t attempted to obtain Dr. Cotte r's report f rom the U.K. court. I am unlikely to disregard th is testim ony in f uture case s, ab sent good faith efforts to obtain the evidence to which Dr. Ke nnedy ref erred. I have, howev er, co nside red Dr. S immonds' repo rt. Using ne sted PCR, h e looke d for the N gene and the H gene and was una ble to find a ny positive results f or eithe r gene in any of Unigenet ics' sam ples. Snyder Re s. Ex. P a t 32, 42. As the N gene is n orma lly prese nt at about 30,000 copies p er cell (a le vel seven t o eight time s higher th an the number of copies of the F gene prese nt during an acute infection ), it shou ld ha ve been more e asily detecte d. Snyder T r. at an d on a conversatio n Dr. Ke nnedy had with Dr. Sh eils, Dr. Ke nnedy testif ied that Unigene tics did ce th eir po sitive resu lts. Ced illo T r. at 824A. Doctor W ard testif ied that if Unigenet ics had sequen ced their positive results, t hat informa tion was never pu blished . Ced Ke nnedy concurred that sequen cing data had not been published . Ced illo T r. at 826. The failure t o publish such informa tion is inexplicable, particu larly in view of the firestorm of criticism over Unigenet ics' testing pro gram. It is equally inexplicable th at, if such data existed, petitione rs would not have attempted to obtain it. In view of all of the evidence available to me, I cannot credit Dr. Ken nedy's testim ony on this p oint. I add that, in con text, Dr. Ken nedy's testim ony is som ewhat am biguous about whether se quencing was perf orme d on the final p roduct of amplification or whethe r the \"sequencin g\" to which h e was ref erring w as done as a part of Unigenet ics' allelic discrimina tor te sting. was: A: All Rig ht. Once you'v e got a positive, yes, you want to sequen ce. In fact, Dr. She ils was asked had they sequen ced and verified that this was ind eed vaccine strain and they had done sequencing of H and F. 190Q: Specif ic to vaccine strain? A: Specif ic - - an a llelic discriminat or from the F. T hey had actu ally sequen ced the prod uct that cam e out. Q: Specif ic to vaccine strain? A: Specif ic to vaccine strain. Q: And they didn 't publish th is? A: This was in - - I ha d assum ed that the Uhlm ann paper h ad alread y been subm itted. So - - an d the Uhlm ann paper ca me out -- Cedillo T r. at 824A-25. It is n ot entirely clear f rom this e xchan ge w hether Dr. K ennedy w as sa ying that the positive resu lts the mselves were sequen ced, or th at kn own v accine strain and known w ild-ty pe measles virus sequen ces were use d to determine wheth er a sample contained vaccine st rain vir us. There is ha rd da ta to ind icate that Unigene tics did the latter; the re is no ne to indicate that they did th e forme r. Doctor K ennedy's testim ony can be read to say that Unigenetics h ad confirmed the prese nce of vaccine strain measle s virus usin g an a llelic discriminat or within t he F gene. Cedillo T r. at 824A, 847. Allelic d iscriminatio n is n ot se quencing. I t is a test to determin e whethe r indivi duals have inh erited a a Unigenetics la attem pted to apply allelic measle s virus un der cond itions t hat were e xperim ental. S nyder T r. at 824A, to Dr. Rima , Unigenetics la boratory w as not reliably diff erentiating be tween vaccine strain and wild- type m easle s virus. Doctor Rim a also discu ssed how the allelic discrimina tion testin g worked with Dr. Sheils, beca use the materials disclosed to him did not adequate ly explain th e process. Using sequence d data from wild-ty pe virus an d vaccine st rain vir us, Un igenetics designed two probe s, on e designed to interact only with vaccine st rain vir al material and one designed to interact o nly w ith wil d-type vi rus m aterial. Dep ending on which vir us was presen t, different fluoresce nce values would be genera ted. Snyder T r. at 856A- 57A. Doctor Rim a examined the data underlying Snyder Res. T r. Ex. 4 at 9, which showed h ow the a llelic discriminat ion d ata was gene rated . The control ma terial f or the vaccine test appears in th e upper right portion of the lower ri ght square o n this exhibit (shown in red). The wild-ty pe virus con trol m aterial app ears in blue in th e upper left quadran t of the chart. Con trols con tainin g both wild-ty pe and vaccine strain virus RNA appear in green o n the slide , in the box in th e upper right qua drant of the chart. The rema inder of the data points come from claima nt sa mples, which are largely cluste red 191in the upper left corn er of the box labe led \"vaccines.\" S nyder T r. at 856A-861 A. Base d on his ana lysis of this d ata, Dr. Rima conclude d that so me of the patient samples were m isident ified a s vaccine strain because replicat es of the sam e sample teste d by Unigenet ics had different resu lts. If one rep licate a ppeared in th e vaccine quadran t and the other app eared in the undetermin ed quadran t, Unigene tics repo rted this a s a \"vaccine st rain\" sam ple. This de monstrat ed that the test they developed was not capable of discrimina ting bet ween vaccine strain and wild-type strains of the virus. These test results from Unigenetics were ne ver pu blished and this me thod is n ot used by othe r labo ratories, other ind ication s tha t the allelic discriminat ion test was no t an effective me thod to differentiate between vaccine strain and wild-type vi rus. S nyder T r. at 861A-863. (8) Copy Numb er Issu es. Doctor Rim a disagreed with Drs. Ken nedy's and Hepn er's asse nly w hen repo rted copy num bers were low. Copy num ber rep orting w as su bject to the same treatment of discord ant results as th e results f or viral genes, and was af fected by the labo ratory's contam inatio n problem Doctor Rim a also te stified that discrep ancie s in th e comparison of the GAP DH housekee ping genes and measle s virus cop y numbers led to incorrect ca lculation s of copy num bers. Snyder T r. Unigenet ics det ected a number of copies of the virus on one run , but zero copie s on a se cond run of the sam e sample, th ey reported the higher n umber, rathe r than attempting to determine what ca used the discrep ancy. Unigene tics' ignoring of zero values was widesprea d. Snyder T r. at 864-65A. The charts appearing on Snyder Res. T r. Ex. 4 at 2, were taken from Dr. Simm onds' repo rt, filed a s Snyder Re s. Ex. P, at 72. The chart on the left reflects th e resu lts from two run s of the sam e sample looking f or the measle s virus F gene . The datapoint in the upper le ft hand portio n of the chart reflects a value of 5,000-6,000 copies, but the replicat e resu lts (the results from the seco nd run) were negative. Unigene tics repo rted this a s a p ositive result. Snyder T r. at 865A-68A . Even w hen the copy numbers w ere h igh, the high values co uld re flect contaminatio n rather than high am ounts of the target su bstance in tissue . Doct or Rima concu rred wi th Drs. Simmonds that the high copy num bers rep result of labo mination , rath er than high am ounts of target virus in tissue . Snyder T r. at 865A-68A ; Ced illo T r. at 2036, 2065A; Snyder Res. E x. P at 85-87. In the U.K. litigation , the samples close st to the row in which the high cop y numbers w ere found were the sam ples m ost likely to b e contaminated. Snyder T r. at 878A-79A . In her po st-hea ring supple mental Cedillo high cop y number sam ples co uld b e the product of \"spon taneous\" cont aminatio n. Cedillo P et. Ex. 120 at 6. She did not clarif y what she meant by \"spont aneous\" co ntamination , but the context suggests th at sh e meant 192something othe r than the evidence of widesp read contaminatio n found by Dr. Bust in. Her qualif ication of her opin ion, coup led with Dr. Bust in's op portu nity to ob serve the Unigenetics la boratory setting an d his access to a substantial am ount of informa tion missing f rom the Uhlm ann paper (which w as th e source o f Dr. Hepn er's kno wledge about Un igenetics o perations), cause s me to give greate r weight to the opinions of Drs. Rima, Simmonds, and Bustin on the effects o f contaminatio n on Unigene tics' repo rted results. A high copy num ber o f measle s virus do es not necessa rily imply that the thresh old cycle (CT) was low . Doct or Rima illustrate d this poin t by ref erence to the \"housekee ping gene\" G APDH, which is prese nt as messen ger RNA [\"mRNA\"] in e ach cell at about 1,000 copies p er cell. Calculatio n errors inv olving GAPDH a ffect the copy numbers rep orted for the target gen e sequence s because the repo rted copy num ber for the F gene in a given sample is b ased on the number of copies of the GAP DH gene's mRNA in the sam e sample. S nyder T r. at 868A-871 A. If a tissue sa mple were degrade d or fixed, it would be more d ifficult to extract th e GA PDH mRNA. In these cases, the GAP DH copy num bers a re low, and calcula tions for measle s virus cop y numbers t hat rely on the average cell nu mbers for GAP DH are u nreliab le. S nyder T r. at 873A-75A . Doctor Rim a conclud ed that when low num bers were repo rted by Unigenetics, the repo rts ere u nreliab le, becau se th e resu lts were o utside the stan dard curve. Most o f the copy numbers repo rted by Unig enetics w ere o utside their stand ard curve. Snyder T r. at 871A-874 . The testim ony and other evidence derived from the U.K. litigation confirms th e validity of the prob lems previously set forth conce rning th at Un igenetics' resu lts are so unreliab le that they shou ld be preclud ed from evidentiary conside ration . Neverthe less, I have con sidered them, but given them no weight. 6.

Leaving aside for the moment the prelim inary natu re of the results, and the lack of peer review because the results have no t been published, a review of the poster prese ntation and abstract d isclosed a number o f reaso ns to acco rd this stud y little weight in d etermining if petitione rs have est ablishe d the presen ce of measle s virus in gut biop sies of ASD p atien ts. Pages 1 -3 of Cedillo Re s. Tr. Ex. 13 co nsisted of pictu res ta ken directly from the Walker-Hepn er po ster p resen tation. After review ing the picture s, Dr. Bu stin e xpresse d conce rn that there was no band in th e picture o n the right side of page 1 a t the level of 726 base pairs. If the run contained measle s virus, a band shou ld ha ve appeared at that point. The picture s on pages 1-2 ref lected a cle ar ba nd at about 300 base pairs and at several oth er po ints. The prese nce of these bands indica ted a problem with th e specif icity of the PCR be cause there were b ands where no bands were e xpected. Additiona lly, the poster indicat ed that 12 patient sam ples were ref lected on the gel, w ith the ladd er in la ne 13. There were n o positive or ne gativ e controls; at a minimu m, the run sh ould have inclu ded a negative contro l. The lack of a negative contro l invalidated the results. Ced illo T r. at 1954A-56 A. Slide number 3 from Cedillo Res. Tr. Ex. 13 co ntained figure 4 f rom the poster prese ntation, which d emonstrated the results from nested PCR. T he bands were blurred, indica ting tha t the primers were not specific. On ce again, th ere was no negative con trol, ren dering th e resu lts m eaningless. Ced illo T r. at 1956A-58 A. Doctor Bustin also testified that the use of 35-40 cycles of amplification was high, particu larly when sted 1959A. There are insuf ficient in dicia o f reliability in this p relimina ry work to acco rd it a ny weight on the question of whether m easle s virus truly ex ists in th e gut t issue o f children with ASD. A s Dr. W ard's d escription of the prelim inary results f rom his lab orato ry that 194were p resen ted in an abstract , but late r determin ed to be wrong (Cedillo T r. at 1864A- 65) illustrat es, there are significan t problem s inhe rent in relyi ng upo n prelimina ry and non-peer reviewed work. T he poster prese ntation provides no basis to co nclud e that the virus is f ound more o ften in ch ildren with ASD t han in th eir typically developing peers. Unle ss it can be shown to be an abnorm al finding, th e presen ce of measle s virus genom ic ma terial in the gut tissue of autistic children says little to nothing ab out possib le cau sation of autism or co-occu rring symp toms and autism . As Griff in no ted in her repo rt, giv en the extreme sensitivity of PCR te sting, vi ral prote ins or RNA m ight be recovered lon g after th e infectiou s virus itself has been cleared . Thus, reports of the prese nce of viral ma terial in these sa mples, e ven if accu rate, do not warrant drawi ng a ca usal co nnection between measle s virus an d gastroin testin al symptoms, much less be tween measle s virus an d autism . Ced illo Res. E x. V at 6. Section VII. Analysis of the Ev idence Regardi ng MMR Causation of A utism. In Theory 1 test ca ses, t he PSC ch ose to presen t theories of causation restricted to a small sub set o f children with ASD: th ose children with regression and gastrointe stinal co mplaints who rece ived the MMR v accine prior to the onset o f ASD symptoms. The receipt of TCVs prior to the MMR v accine was not a necessary cond ition f or this the ory, merely one that, according to petitione rs, w ould enhance th e likelihood that the measle s virus cou ld pe rsist to t rigger ASD in children genetica lly pred ispose d to the condition . Ample re ason s for the rest ricted n ature of their theo ry exist. T he most ob vious one is tha t the MMR v accine cannot cause autism in th ose in whom the condition manifested prior to th e MMR v accina tion. Thus, children with early onset o r classic ASD were, by design, e xclude d from this p articular th eory. It was the striking tem poral conn ection between the MMR v accina tion subse phenomenon of regression-t he dram atic loss of langua ge and /or other skills-that forme d the basis f or pe titione rs' theo ry. In Dr. Kinsb ourne's words, it is evidence that \"som ething mu st ha ve most likely hap pened to ch ange t he trajecto ry in su ch a radica l way.\" Snyder T r. at 479A-80A . Thus, the search for a theory to explain ho w the MMR v accine could cau se autistic regression ensu ed. The existence o f gastrointe stinal symp toms provided: (1) a site for inf lammation which co uld a ffect the brain, as well as th e gut, throu gh the sprea d of proin flammatory cytokine s; (2) a site f rom which m easle s virus itself could spre ad to the brain; and (3)391 a site where measle s virus cou ld be detecte d more e asily than directly in th e brain. If inflammation, rather than direct in vasion of the brain by me asles virus, w ere the causa l Petitioners' theories were somewhat unclear regarding a direct effect of the measles virus on391 the brain. Doctor Kinsbourne posited inflammation as a link in the causal process without directly stating that the inflammation must be caused by the measles virus itself in the brain. Snyder Tr. at 488A-89A; Cedillo Tr. at 1151-53, The presence of ILNH provided, at least in theory, a reservoir for measles virus which could then infect the brain. 195mechan ism, the virus m ight not be in th e brain a t all; d etection in the gut co uld b e sufficient t o link A SD an d ILNH to th e same cause. However, the prob lems with th e case presen ted by petitio ners f or gene ral causa tion are o verwhelm ing. T he quality of the petitione rs' ex perts paled in comparison to the world-class experts p roffered by respon dent. The theories p etition ers' experts advance d lacke d support in b oth logic and resea rch. A s Dr. W ard testified, an hypothe sis has a life span. An hypoth esis m ay be b iologically plau sible a t the tim e it is first advance d. As evidence accum ulate s, the hypothesis m ay be stre ngthen ed or weake ned. The MMR ay have biologically t its incep g body of scient ific evidence has tippe d the sca les decisively against it. Snyder T r. at 975. The weight of the scient ific evidence is tha t the measles vaccine virus plays no role in the pathogenesis o r triggering of autism. I thus conclu de that petitione rs have f ailed to demonstrate that the MMR v accine can cause autism, even in t he highly circumscribe d subset of children with regressiv e ASD an d gastrointe stinal symp toms. Aside from the flaws evident in the theories of causation advance d, there are other reaso ns for con cluding th at MMR vaccine cau sation of autism is imp robable. Withou t advancin g an a lterna te ca use, respo ndent produced compelling evidence that MMR causatio n of autism is unlikely, beca use epidemiologic studie s have failed to detect a ny relationsh ip be tween the MMR vaccine , TCVs, o r the measle s virus, a nd ASD. Evidence of the prese nce of measle s virus geno mic m aterial in children with ASD is not reliable or persua sive as to causa tion beca use of faulty scientif ic me thods and practice s. The evidence for the postulated \"sepa rate phenotype\" in ASD, that com bines regressiv e autism and enterocolitis, is sca nty and speculative. T he occurren ce of regression in t emporal proximity to the MMR v accine is insuf ficient, standing alon e, to demonstrate a causal co nnection. Given th at the MMR v accine is ad ministered to most children within t he six to nine months before A SD sympto ms beco me apparent, a temporal relation ship b etween t he vaccine and onset of sympto ms would be likely in many, if not most, cases of ASD. See Gran t, 956 F.2 d at 1148 (a proximat e temporal associa tion alone is n ot su fficient t o establish vaccine cau sation ). A. Credibility of Experts. In co urts th at apply the Fede ral Rules o f Evidence , it is d oubtful that so me of petitione rs' ex pert witnesse s would have withstood challenge un der Daub ert and Rule 702, based on their lack of qualif ication s to opine on the subjects at issu e and the specu lative and unsupp orted nature of their opinio ns. In ca ses f iled u nder the Vaccine Act, where the rules o f evidence do not apply, Daub ert does not gen erally serve as a basis t o exclude testimony, but rathe r, a frame work to weigh an d evaluate testim ony. As Ju stice B lackm un said in Daub ert: But, in o rder to qualif y as \"scien tific knowledge,\" an inference or assertion be the scie ntific me thod.

Daub ert provided a non-exhaustive list o f factors for a court to co nside r in evaluating a proffer of expert te stimo ny: (1) w hether a theory has or ca n be tested; (2) whether the theory has been subje cted to peer review and publicat ion (a relevant, but not dispo sitive conside ration ); (3) the known or potential error rate of a techn ique; an d (4) w hether the theory U.S. at 593-94. Kumho Tire added that a trial judge m ust e nsure \"that an expert, whether b asing test imony upon profession al stu dies o r person al experien ce, e mploys in the courtroom the sam e level of intellectua l rigor that ch aracte rizes th e practice o f an expert in t he relevant f ield.\" 5 26 U.S. a t 152. Justice Breyer add ed that, in applying Daub ert: The trial cou rt mu st ha ve the same kind of latitu de in de ciding how to test an expert's reliability, and to decide whether o r when special brief ing or other proce edings are ne eded to investigate reliab ility, as it enjoys w hen it decid es whether or n ot that expert's relevant testim ony is reliable. 526 U.S. at 152 (emp hasis o riginal). The Ninth Circuit's Daub ert decision a fter rem and is pa rticularly instruct ive to trial courts in evaluat ing prof fered scient ific testim ony f or ad equate indicia of reliability. It offers m any para llels to V accine Act cases in gene ral, an d the Theory 1 gen eral causa tion testim ony in pa rticular. L ike th e Federal Circuit in Althe n, the Ninth Circuit noted that cau sation can be esta blished , even when the precise mecha nism of injury is unkn own, \"if there is suf ficiently comp elling proof that the agent m ust h ave cause d the damage somehow.\" 43 F.3d at 1314 (em phasis origi nal). The experts prof fered by plaint iffs in Daub ert fell into three categories: (1) t hose who reanalyzed studies sho wing no statistica l associa tion between Bendectin u se in pregnan cy and birth de fects t o demonstrate the existence of such a link; (2) tho se who relied on animal stud ies to demonstrate Bendectin cau ses b irth de fects; and (3) tho se who po inted to chem ical similarities b etween B endectin and other drugs susp ected of causing birth d efects. The circuit cou rt noted that the \"sm all bu t determined group o f scient ists test ifying on b ehalf of the Bendectin p laintif fs\" const ituted the whole o f a distinct m inority of the scient ific community. Id. The court also n oted that the question of admissibility of an opinion arises o nly if it is f irst esta blished that the proffered witness is in f act a n expert in the relevant scien tific field. 43 F.3d at 1315. A \"self -serv ing assertion \" by an e xpert that \"his con clusions were 'd erived by the scie ntific me thod'\" is no t binding on a co urt. 43 F.3d at 1316. The party of fering tha t expert \"m ust sh ow that t he expert's f indings are base d on sound science , and this will req uire so me objective, inde pendent validation of the expert's m ethodology.\" Id. 197The Ninth Circuit a pplied an addition al factor to the analysis of an expert's opinion, one that is sim ilar to t he same intellectu al rigor test th e Supreme Court applied later in Kumho Tire . The circuit cou rt con sidered whether the matters t he expert proposed to testif y about flowed from resea rch con ducted independently of involv ement in the litigation in questio n, becau se th is factor provides ob jective proof that the resea rch w as co scien tific purp oses. 43 F.3d at 1317. See also Exxon Shipping Com pany v. Gra nt Baker, 128 S. Ct. 2 605, 2626 n.17 (20 08) (de clining to consid er resea rch funded in pa rt by a pa rty to the litigation). In this case , the quest ion is n ot one of admissibility, it is one of weight, b ecau se in ou r ben ch hearings, th ere is n o jury to b e misled. For m any of the reaso ns th e Ninth Circuit on rema nd affirmed the district co urt's grant o f sum mary judgm ent to the defendants, I co nclud e that the evidence advance d by petitione rs in th e Theory 1 general ca usation ca se does not esta blish ca usation b y a preponderance of the evidence. I find it significan t that petition ers did not have a measle s virologist to e stablish the biolo gic plausibility ry of s virus cau sation . Instead, they of fered the testimony of Dr. Ken nedy, a well-respecte d virologist, bu t not one whose re search had focuse d on measle s. His on ly published work on the measle s virus w as a literatu re survey, w ritten when he was an expert witness in the U.K . MMR litig ation . Much of his testim Snyd er drew on a n out-of-date verison of Dr. Grif fin's cha pter on measles , as he testif ied to matters om itted from the most re cent versi on. Petitione r's imm unologist, Dr. Byers, is not board certif ied in allergy and immunology, does not se e patien ts ou tside of a litigation context, ha s no expertise in mercury 's imp act o n the immune system , and offered opinions on immune system testin g (the u se of adult param eters to m easu re ad equacy of imm une function in children ) that defied lo gic, comm on sense , and were cou nter to the published, peer no rese arch o n autism , has not actively treated patients for more than 17 years, has published only a f ew speculat ive and theoretica l articles o n autism , plus one textboo k cha pter rders, ch anged a ch art on autism 's known cau ses in one of his b ook chap ters to creat e the impression that measle s is a recogniz ed cause of autism, and whose m ore rece nt place o f work ap pears to b e the courtroo m, not the lab orato ry. He advance d theories that are based on testin g at a laboratory w ith kn own error rates t hat are unaccept ably high and results that are scientif ically implausible , are unsupp orted by the weight of the scient ific literatu re, and which f ly in th e face of what is kno wn about the measle s virus an d central n ervous system infection s. Doctor Co rbier f ares little better. Evaluatin g his testim ony in a general ca usation context only (not co nside ring his opin ions o n Yate s Hazlehurst a s a treatin g physici an), Dr. Corbier's test imony is person op See v. In c., 959 F.2 d 1349, 1360 (6 Cir. 199 2). He has con ducted noth perso nal re search into autism's ca uses, and the rese arch u pon which h e relied was not, in gene ral, sup portive of his p osition on either measle s or a utoimmunity as a cause. Docto r Hepn er was well- acquaint ed with how to pe rform PCR, bu t nothing in h er backgroun d or pub lications reflected any expertise in detectin g mea sles vir us in tissue or bo dy flu ids. He r only research into measles virus det ection had not been published , much less subje cted to peer review. Yet, she proffered favorable o pinion s on the quality of the testing describe d in the Uhlm ann paper, withou t any knowledge o f Unigenetics' a ctual error rate. She failed to rebut the findings of Dr. W ard's lab orato ry demonstrating tha t the F gen e primers u sed by Unig enetics am plified h ost tissue a s well as t he measles virus. Doctor K rigsman was qualif ied to testify about gastroen terolo gy. Howev er, his testim ony w as not enhanced by his prof ession al dif ficulties. His qualifica tions to establish th e validity of a new fo rm of gastrointe stinal d isorder, u nreco gnized by othe r authorities in the field, were, e ven when inflated , sad ly lacking. Doctor A posh ian was w ell-qualified to discuss m ercury tox icology in gene ral, bu t his pe ncha nt for con flating the species of mercury w hen discussin g toxi city did not enhance his cred ibility . His te stimo ny appe ared similar to the disqualif ied e xperts in Daub ert, who were wil ling to te stify that Bendectin ca used birth defects, base d on similarities in chem ical structu re, rath er than specif ic resea rch. I n any ev ent, his testim ony beca me peripheral t o the central issu e of MMR causat ion in these ca ses, a s he did n ot link TCVs to imm une dysfu nction or su ppression, and Dr. Byers w as ineffective in he r atte mpts to do so. B. The Failure o f Proo f. 1. There is No E vidence W ild-Type Mea sles Virus Ca uses ASD. Leaving aside the Daub ert analysis of petitione rs' ex perts' qua lifications and opinions, other evident iary prob lems are glaringly apparent. One obvious a nd overw helm ing proble m with th e PSC's f irst the ory of vaccine cau sation is tha t there is virtually no evidence that the wild-type m easle s virus can cause ASD, e ither d irectly , throu gh som e action of the pathogen on the brain , or in directly, by creat ion o f a disease or sympto ms, such as in flammation, that trigg ers th e onset of ASD. The Vaccin e Program h as lon g recogniz ed that if a pathogen ca n cause a particular d isease or side effect o f a disease , it is likely that the vaccine against that pathogen can do so a s well, a position endorse d by respo ndent's e xperts, Drs. W ard a nd Griffin with regard to the measles virus. See also K. Stratto n, et al.,eds. Va S afety Comm ittee, of Medicine Adve A ssociate d with Childh ood Vaccines: Evide nce Bearing o Causa lity 4) at 22 (\"the vaccine-a dverse n cu rrent kn owledge a bout the biology of the vaccine an d the adverse event. Such informa tion include s experience with th e naturally occu rring infection against which th e vaccine is giv en, particularly if the vaccine is a live attenuated virus.\"). 199If the pathogen itself cannot cause th e conditio n, it is unlikely that the vaccine against the pathogen can do so, abse nt an autoimmune react ion to the vaccine o r a co mponent thereof.392 No evidence was int roduced that suggests th at co ngenita l measles, unlike rubella, is relat ed to the developm ent of ASD. Likewise, the re was no reliab le evidence that post-nat al measle s infection s can cause ASD. A lthou gh Dr. Kinsbo urne testified about a 1948 case report that purported ly linked measle s disea se to autism, I did no t393 find h is testim ony supp orted by the article. Doctor W ard review ed a translatio n of the abstract o f the Bosch ca se rep ort, a nd testif ied that the article co ncern ed two cases o f \"infantile de mentia\" with on set sh ortly after a natural m easle s infection . Ced illo T r. at 1825A-28 A. Calculatin g that between 1948 and 1978, when the measle s vaccine be came widely av ailable , approximate ly nine billion ch ildren were bo rn, Dr. W ard testified that virtually all of these ch ildren would h ave bee n infected with w ild-ty pe measles, most before they w ere three years old. Between 1948 and 1978, there were n o other case reports of an asso ciation between measle s disea se and autism, much less any stud ies linking me asles t o ASD. Ce dillo T r. at 1826A-28 A. Thus, Dr. Kinsb ourne's use of the Bosch a rticle as su pport for bio logic plausibility of measle s virus cau sation is extreme ly weak. Not only is it f ar from clear th at the \"infantile de mentia\" d escribed was a condition consistent with an ASD dia gnosis, th e lack of any other repo rt of an asso ciation between measle s disea se and autism m akes the connection e xtremely improba ble. Adding to th is imp robability are several epid emiologic studie s tha t attempted to find a relatio nship between measle s virus an d ASD. No relatio nship was detected.394 Adjuvants or contaminants in a vaccine could, theoretically, trigger an adverse vaccine392 reaction, but that is not the theory advanced in the Theory 1 cases. The Theory 2 cases presented the evidence that the thimerosal component of vaccines can cause ASD. V. Bosch, Demenz Folge (1948) [\"Bosch\"], filed (in German) as Cedillo Pet. Ex. 61, Tab QQQ. As this is apparently the only article suggesting that wild-type measles could cause autism, it is inexplicable that petitioners, whose expert apparently considered this theory plausible, did not file a translated copy. See, e.g., W. Chen, et al., No evidence for links between autism, MMR and measles virus. J.394 PSYCHOL. MED. 34: 543-53 (2004) [\"Chen\"], filed as Cedillo Res. Ex. P, Tab 28. The Chen study (which Dr. Fombonne co-authored) used the U.K. National Autistic Society membership to identify 2407 autistic individuals born between 1959-1993. The study examined prenatal and post-natal exposures up to the age of 18 months to wild-type measles virus, the monovalent measles vaccine, and the MMR vaccine. Prior to 1967, no measles vaccine was available and any exposure would have been to the wild-type measles virus. From 1968 to 1986, the primary exposure was to the monovalent measles vaccine; from 1987 to 1991, to the MMR vaccine, and from 1991 to 1993, to a modified MMR vaccine. No associations between measles outbreaks or epidemics and rates of autism were observed. See discussion of this study at Cedillo Tr. at 2548-51A. Additional studies are discussed below. 200In sp ite of the existence of measle s vaccines, a pproximately 500, 000 children a year worldw ide st ill experien ce wil d-type m easle s infection s. Desp ite th e widesprea d nature o f such infection s, an d the grow ing aw areness o f autism as a disord er even in the developing w orld, t he medical litera ture still conta ins between wild-ty pe measles nd autism. This no t an asso ciation that would be misse d becau se m easle s outbrea ks com e in waves. T he east coast of the U.S. and the eastern p rovinces o f Cana da had a measle s outbrea k in th e 1990s, with thousand s of cases reported. There was no sudden spike in t he number o f autism cases in eith er locale after th ese measles o utbreaks. Snyder T r. at 949A. Assum ing, arguendo, that measle s virus directly cause s autism, petitione rs did not proffer an y explana tion for why the ra tes o f autism were a pparently much lower when measle s disea se was epid emic or en demic. A child in 1950 who disp layed395 some disorders o n the autism spectrum would likely have been diagno sed as m entally retarde d or suffering f rom a childhoo d psychosis, rathe r than as autistic. Howev er, it seem s highly unlikely that a conn ection would ha ve been missed e ntirely between measles d isease and such behaviors. T o the extent that petition ers are contending that TCV exposu re was necessa ry to set the stage f or susce ptibility to th e measle s vaccine, they have overlooke d the other sources of mercury then prese nt in over-the-cou nter medicatio ns, su ch as tee thing po wders o r merthiolat e, during the period b efore the developm ent of new vaccines an d TCV s disea se its acco mpanying fever, rash, a nd other sympto ms.

T he two persisten t measle s inf ection s, MIBE and SSPE, involve mu tations of the virus, o bvious pa thologic changes in the brain , and a relent less ne urologic de terioratio n resu lting in de ath. These condition s are not similar396 to ASD, e ither in sympto matology or prognosis. W hen measle s virus directly inf ects t he central ne rvous system , there is a persistent and progressiv e impairm ent of the level of conscio usne ss. In ASD, there are decline s, im proveme nts, and plateaus. The wild-ty pe measles virus can also in directly cause, or co ntribu te to, a wide variety of condition s. W orldw ide, pneumonia and diarrhea, caused by oppo rtunistic infection s after m easle s disea se, st ill kill thousan ds of children annually. Clea rly, measles d isease can cause fever and inflammation. Yet th ose parts of the world where measles d isease is still a m ajor th reat to public h ealth do not appear to h ave rates of The initial results of two major surveys of ASD in the U.S. were released in February, 2007. 395 The prevalence estimates for eight-year-olds in 2000 was 6.7 per 1000 (67 per 10,000). The prevalence rate was measured again in eight-year-olds from the same states in 2002. The average figure was 6.6 per 1000 (66 per 10,000), indicating that between 2000 and 2002, the prevalence rate was essentially unchanged. However, these rates reflect a marked increase in autism diagnoses from the 4-5 per 100,000 rate estimates in 1960s and 70s. Cedillo Tr. at 2510-12; Cedillo Res. Tr. Ex. 21 at 5.

Epidemiology has Failed to Detect any Asso ciation between the MMR Vaccin e and ASD o r Co-Morbid Ga strointe stinal Co mplaints. Could ASD b e caused by the vaccine strain virus, bu t not the wild-type vi rus? This is, in essen ce, the MINE the ory prop osed in Dr. Dyken's ed itorial an d mentioned, in pa ssing, by Dr . Kinsbou rne. If it cou ld, th e introduction of the measle s vaccine shou ld ha ve trigg ered a su dden spike in t he cases of ASD in the period f ollowi ng the introd uction of the vaccine. n umber o f well-cond ucted epidemiologic studies ha ve found no such incre ase. 397 See B.

Dales, et al., Time Trends in Autism and in MMR Immunization Coverage in California, JAMA 285(9): 1183-85 (2001) [\"Dales\"], filed as Cedillo Res. Ex. P, Tab 33. The Taylor 1999 study was a time trend analysis to determine if there was an increased incidence of autism diagnoses after 1988, when the MMR vaccine was introduced in the U.K. An examination of the records of over 400 children with ASD, born between 1979-1992, found that the number of cases by year of birth increased steadily, without any sudden increase after introduction of the MMR vaccine. The DeStefano study, a 2004 case-control study based in metropolitan Atlanta, compared the age at the first MMR vaccination between children with ASD and typically developing children. The study compared 624 children with ASD (including subgroups of children with and without regression) to 1824 control children, matched for age, gender, and school. The data demonstrated that similar proportions of case and control children were vaccinated by 18 months and before 24 months. The Masden study was a very large retrospective cohort examination of records for all children born in Denmark from 1991-1998, 82% of whom received an MMR vaccination. It found no association between vaccination, or age at vaccination, and the development of an autistic disorder. Doctor Fombonne described this as a very powerful and important study because of its design, nationwide scope, and extremely high statistical power. Cedillo Tr. at 2539A-41A. The Smeeth study was a large case-control study based on the U.K. General Practice Research Database. It compared 1294 children with ASD to 4469 controls, matched for age, gender, and primary care providers. It found no connection between MMR vaccination and autism. The Smeeth investigators also included a meta-analysis of the Madsen and DeStefano studies, along with the data generated from their own study. All of the studies showed a relative risk of less than one. Combined, the odds ratio was 0.87, with a confidence interval of 0.76-1.001. Cedillo Tr. at 2541A-45A; Cedillo Res. Tr.

P, Tab 33, it compared MMR vaccination rates in birth cohorts by 17 and 24 months of age, with the number of children in those birth cohorts diagnosed with autism. The relative increase in MMR vaccinations was 14%. In contrast, the relative increase in autism rates per births was 373% over the same period. Id. at 1184-85.

In Vaccine Act cases, the law is clear tha t petitione rs cann ot be required to produce epidemiologic studie s to supp ort a causation respo ndent introd ucing epidemiology to demonstrate that vaccine ca usation is u nlikely. Epide miology can never be direct proof that vaccines d o not cause ASD, but it can be stron g circumsta ntial e vidence th at k to causa tion in an individual ca se. It can, howev er, su fficiently unde rmine a hypothe sis or th eory regarding causat ion, making reliance on such a theory unreason able under a ll the facts a nd circumsta nces of an individual ca se.

DD, Tab 12. 406 A child was placed in the word loss group if the child had spontaneously used at least three407 meaningful words, other than \"mama\" or \"dada,\" on a daily basis for at least one month, then stopped using all words for at least one month, prior to 36 months of age. Children without word loss, but who had lost at least 25% of skills in three or more skills areas, were also part of the \"regression\" category. Cedillo Res. Ex. P, Tab 124, at 4-5.

The possib ility remains, but the likelihoo d that it is prese nt but undisco vered, declines with each successive sea Similarly, altho ugh ep idem iology cannot esta blish th at vaccine s do not cau se autism , it ca n establish the improbability that they do. In se arching f or con nections b etween A SD an d various e nvironmental factors, epidemiology has not stripp ed the apartment entirely bare. No epidem iologic study has examine d whethe r a co mbinatio n of TCVs an d MMR is associa ted with autism , altho ugh stu dies h ave examine d this possib ility with both TCVs an d MMR sepa rately. There are no studies th at have looke d specifically at the causes o f regressiv e autism , as opposed to autism in gene ral. T here are, however, stud ies th at have explored a n associa tion between regressiv e autism and MMR, w ith no associatio n found. Additiona lly, no stud ies ha ve loo ked specif ically at regressiv e autism in ch ildren with gut inflammation. Ced T r. at 1058-60; 2679A-80A. These \"unse arche d\" area s leave open the very slim p ossibility that a n associatio n exists. Howev er, th e nature an d number o f the stud ies alrea dy condu cted makes the possibility highly remote. Resea rchers ha ve not ignore d the striking tem poral conn ection between the MMR v accina tion and the onset o f regressiv e autism . When the connection h as been examine d more clo sely, the t emporal relation ship b ecom es less striking. Th e MMR vaccina tion has been rou tinely adm inistered to children between 12-18 m onths of age, with co verage rate s of 80-95%. Thus, the vast ma jority of children with regression would have rece ived the MMR v accine in th e months im mediate ly prior to the age a t which p arents first beco me concerne d about their child's d evelopm ent and when a loss of skills is mo st likely to ha ve been noted. Cau sally linking the two events would require a showing tha t more ch ildren with regression h ad received th e MMR v accine than either children withou t ASD or w ith an ASD bu t no regression. Alterna tively, a cau sal conn ection might be demonstrated by evi dence linking a particu lar time frame after vaccina tion in which regression would likely occur. T wo stu dies a ttempted to do just that. The DeW ilde stu dy looke d at the U.K . gene ral practice database for evidence409 of an increa se in health ca re provider vi sits po st-MMR vaccination . They f ound reco rds for 71 children with a diagno sis of autism and receip t of MMR bef ore d iagnosis, a nd S.

By \"consult\" the authors meant visits to a physician. 206matched each of them to four co ntrols b ased on age, gen der, month of MMR vaccina tion, and health care provider.

However, in th e six mon ths p rior to th e diagnosis of autism, the number of patient contacts with the prima ry care team was higher f or the case ch ildren t han the controls. As the median tim e between MMR vaccination and autism diagno sis w as 1053 days, there was no overlap between the six months after th e vaccinatio n and the six-mon th window bef ore d iagnosis.

The study casts consid erable do ubt on the validity of parenta l repo rts of conn ection between MMR and the first beh avioral man ifestations of autism. Doctor Fo mbonne also te stified a bout one of his o wn stu dies examin ing the410 ages of autistic children when parents first not ed developm ental con cerns. The mean age at which p arents be came concern ed did n ot materially vary , regardless o f whether the children had rece ived an MMR v accine .

All of the repu table stu dies have411 failed to find a ny statistical co nnection between ASD a nd the MMR v accine . 3. Measles Virus Has No t Been Reliably Detecte d in Children with ASD. The only evi dence th at truly distinguishe d children with \"regr essive autistic enteroco litis\" from other children was th e finding of measle s virus in gut or CSF. Was this e vidence su fficiently reliable to suggest tha t the virus was causa l of ASD a nd/or gastrointe stinal d isorders? I conclud e that it was not. Fombonne and Chakrabarti 2001, Cedillo Res. Ex. P, Tab 60.410 Although several epidemiologic studies, primarily authored by Dr. and Mr. Geier, purported to411 find a relationship between vaccines and autism were filed, petitioners did not present any testimony about them. See n. 204, supra. 207The bedrock of the scient ific proce ss is reprod ucibility. If a result o r effect is412 real, it can be repeated. If a different resu lt obtains from efforts to duplicate it, th e experimen t must, at a minimu m, be repe ated. Cedillo T r. at 2014-15A. Unigenetics' results co uld n ot be duplicat ed by any othe r research ers, wi th the possib le exceptio n of the incom plete stud y d Drs. W alker, He pner, and Krigsman. The prelimin ary nature of that work preclude s placin g any sig nificant reliance on it. Un less measles virus can be detected in greater nu mbers of children with ASD th an in typically developin g children, the prelim inary fin dings are largely irrelev ant in establishing a causa l conn ection between s a nd gastrointe stinal co mplaints, much less a connection with ASD. T he mere prese nce of measle s virus in gut tissue would be extreme ly weak circumsta ntial e vidence of MMR causat ion o f autism, particu larly in view of the paucity of evidence that \"autistic en teroco litis\" is a sep arate phenotype of autism. The prese nce of measle s virus in CSF, if reliable , would pre sent a different, and far stron ger, case for cau sation , even if petitione rs could not demonstrate such a finding m ore frequent ly in ch ildren with ASD t han in th eir typically developin g peers. Unfortun ately, the evidence for the presen ce of measle s virus in CSF is no t reliab le, becau se of the flaws in Unigene tics' testin g. C. Con clusion. Doctor Ru st use d the term \"scien tific fraud\" in de scribing the informa tion upon which t he MMR theory of causation is ba sed. While n oting th at scie ntists a re very caref ul ab out using th at term, he testified that there was \"ab undant evidence \" of scientif ic fraud in th e body of evidence developed to su pport the MMR- autism hypothe sis. Hazlehurst T r. at 506A-07A . Sadly, the petitione rs in th is litig ation have been the victims of bad scien ce, co nducted to supp ort litigation rathe r than to advance medical a nd scientif ic und erstan ding of ASD. The evidence in sup port of petitione rs' causa l theory is weak, contradicto ry, and sive. is pa rticularly ering e body con nection\" b etween MMR vaccination and onset of regression was also u ndercut b y a co nside rable body of evidence showing onse t of regression ca n be triggered b y gene expression. Children with Ret t's disord er, which is en tirely genet ic in nature, evince loss o f skills at sp ecific time s in th eir de velopment, withou t trigg ering events. Othe r genetic co nditio ns m anifest when a particular gene is expressed ; for examp le, Hun tington's ch orea manifests d ecad es after co ncep tion, withou t a triggering event. Given the com plex genetic b asis f or AS D and the epidem iologic inv estigation s into regression, gene expression is a m ore likely ex planation than the MMR v accine for the manifestation of regressiv e ASD sympto ms. Interestingly, Dr. Wakefield's commentary in Snyder echoes the importance of reproducibility. 412 In commenting on Dr. Singh's laboratory findings, Dr. Wakefield wrote: \"The number of samples is not important at this stage. What is important is the reproducibility.\" Snyder Pet. Ex. 27 at 2. 208Doctor Fo mbonne summed up the body of scient ific resea rch into ASD's ca v accine hypoth esis, sa ying the som children are genetica lly pred ispose d to abnorm al rea ctions to TCVs an d the MMR vaccine so a s to cause autism was less likely than the possibility of the earth being the center of the solar system .

The record a s a whole f ails414 Whether Colten still holds a PDD-NOS diagnosis is uncertain, but it is clear that the condition413 persisted longer than the statutorily required six months. He was released from the developmentally delayed category at school in August, 2004. Snyder Pet. Ex. 15, p. 125. The parties stipulated that thimerosal was present in \"preservative amounts\" in the three414 hepatitis B vaccines and the three hemophilus influenzae type b [\"Hib\"] vaccines Colten received prior to his MMR vaccine.

They have also stipulated that thimerosal was not present, or present only in trace amounts, in the diphtheria, tetanus, and acellular pertussis [\"DTaP\"] vaccination he received on July 9, 1998, two and one-half months after his MMR vaccination. Id., \u00b6\u00b6 9-10. The records of the Hib vaccination Colten received concurrently with the MMR vaccination are insufficient to establish whether the Hib vaccine contained any thimerosal. Id., \u00b6 10. Neither the joint stipulation nor any evidence submitted at the hearing established the exact amount of thimerosal Colten received, although Dr. Bradstreet referred to \"his 100 plus micrograms of mercury in the form of Thimerosal\" without explaining how that figure was derived.

Two gene ral legal principles guide th e reso lution of conflicts bet ween contemporaneous reco rds an d later-add uced evidence . The first is tha t the absen ce of a reference to specific symptoms in a medica l record d oes not conclusiv ely establish the absence of sympto ms during th at time frame . See, e.g., Murphy v.

Snyder T r. at 41-43, 87. t estified that Colten developm ental pro gress was S T 146A, 154A-55 . The medical reco rds prese nted a slightly different pictu re, in that Colten showed an early sig n of developmental dela y followed by app arently normal developm ent. The video records showed so me behaviors tha t, at least in re trospe ct, reflect a reas o f concern. Addition ally, the reco rds an d testimo ny are som ewhat incon regarding Colten 's vocab ulary his MMR vaccina tion. Between Colten 's discha rge from the hospital a fter his birth a nd his two mo nth well-bab y visit, Colte n had three medica l visits to t he Halifax Family Health Cen ter [\"HFHC\" ] for illnesse s and one trip to the Halif ax Medical Cen ter [\"HMC\"] em ergency417 The Apgar score is a numerical assessment of a newborn's condition, usually taken at one416 minute and five minutes after birth. The score is derived from the infant's heart rate, respiration, muscle tone, reflex irritability, and color, with from zero to two points awarded in each of the five categories. See DORLAND'S at 1670. He saw Dr. Thomas Land on January 27, 1997, for a non-productive cough. He was417 described as alert, smiling, and in no acute distress. He was recorded as breastfeeding. Snyder Pet. Ex. 7, p. 64. Colten was seen again February 3, 1997, for a recheck of his upper respiratory infection [\"URI\"] symptoms. His cough persisted and he had a clear, runny nose, which was worse at night. He had a 211room . The March 2, 1997 emergency room visit w as promp ted by Colten's t hree week history of a co ld an d congestion withou t fever. Af ter examinatio n and a chest x-ray , he was diagnosed with upper respirato ry congestion. His pare nts were to ld to return if he had fever or increase d resp iratory distress. Sn yder P et. Ex. 11, His tw o month well- child ch eckup on March 1 2, 1997, was at th e HFHC. His height a nd head circum ference were at the 50 percentile and his weig ht was at the 75th th ntile, coincidin g with Mrs. Sn yder's d escription of him as a chubby bab y. He had a mild pa pular rash o n his arms and face, a possible reactio n to a new bath soap . He received his se cond hepatitis B vaccinatio n, [\"DPT \"] and Hib vaccinat ion and his first oral po lio vaccine at this visit. Sn yder P et.418 Exs. 7, p . 61 and 15, p. 11; Snyder T r. at 39. During the period between his two m onth and four m onth well- child ch eckup s, Colten logged thre e visits to eith er the emergency room at HMC or to HFHC. All th ree visits conce rned possible a llergic ns to formu la after exclusiv e breastf eeding. 419 On Ma rch 19 , 1997, at the seco nd of these th ree visits, Colten 's tem perature was 100.6, rectally. Doctor L and prescribe d a ten-day course o f an antibiotic. Snyder Pet. Ex. 7, pp. 59-60. On the third visit, on April 10, 1 997, he saw Dr . Steven Sa hai for the first time . Colte n had a rash , emesis, a nd a discharge f rom his right eye tha t was diagnose d as an inflammation of the lacrima l gland in his eye. S nyder Pet . Ex. 8, p. 129. At his four m onth well- child visit on May 9, 1 997, Colte n saw Dr. Sah ai again. Snyder Pe t. Ex. 8, p. 128. Colte n rece ived seco nd tions at this visi t. Do ctor Sa hai re corde d that Co lten passe d all of his developm ental mileston es, e xcept rolling ov er. He n oted a little m ild m otor dela y, and420 slightly elevated temperature, and his parents were advised to chart it and to return if it exceeded 100.4 degrees. At this visit, he was recorded as taking formula without problems. Snyder Pet. Ex. 7, p. 63. The February 6, 1997 visit was for emesis, and he was diagnosed with viral gastroenteritis. Id., p. 62. Colten received Tetramune vaccine, which contains both DPT and Hib. Snyder Pet. Ex. 7, p.418 61. Colten had a severe rash on his face, ears, trunk, armpits, and groin at an emergency room419 visit on March 16, 1997. His parents reported that he had broken out with hives shortly after his first Enfamil formula feeding. He had problems with vomiting after a second type of formula was introduced, and refused to drink a third type of formula. Snyder Pet. Exs. 11, pp. 49-51, 7, pp. 59-60, and 8, p. 129. A history of exclusive breastfeeding, taken at the March 16, 1997 emergency room visit, conflicted with two prior entries in his medical records, which indicated he was taking formula. Snyder Pet. Ex. 7, p. 63 (reflecting formula feeding without problems) and Snyder Pet. Ex. 7, p. 62 (prescribing Pedialyte for a day followed by half-strength formula for a day or two for his gastroenteritis). Mrs. Snyder denied that Colten had any problems rolling over at four months of age. Snyder420 Tr. at 43. Given the other comments in Dr. Sahai's records concerning Colten's need for stimulation, I resolve this conflict in favor of the contemporaneous record. 212indicat ed that Colte n was not getting en ough st imulation .

His right tympanic membrane was erythematous. He was diagnosed with right otitis media and URI, and was prescribed a ten-day course of Amoxicillin for the ear infection and Tylenol for his fever. He was described as a well- developed and well nourished infant. His parents were told to follow up with his pediatrician in a week, but there is no record that they did so. Snyder Pet.

In sh ort, p rior to h is MMR v accina tion, Colten had exhibite d early signs of food allergies and asth ma, in a dditio n to a number o f fevers and several gastrointe stinal, respirato ry, and throat infection s. 432 These medica l records d id no t spe cifically reflect Colte n's lan guage de velopment in terms o f the number of words h e used. Mrs. Sn yder testified that his lan guage developm ent was norma l, and that he used between 10-20 words prior to the vaccina tion, includ ing a nu mber of names of parents, siblings, an d grand parents. She identified \"ca r,\" \"ball,\" and \"bye bye\" as oth er words h e used. Snyder P et. Ex. 33, p. 15; Snyder T r. at 39, 43, and 80. By report, Colten had been coughing and wheezing for 36 hours. Snyder Pet. Ex. 11, pp. 41-428 45. A sibling had the infection, but Colten's rapid strep test was negative. Colten was given Amoxil429 for ten days. At this visit, Dr. Sahai recorded that Mrs. Snyder was quite concerned about Colten because he was acting ill with low grade temperatures. He was diagnosed with strep-negative pharyngitis. Snyder Pet. Ex. 8, p. 120. Colten was described as neurologically \"appropriate\" at this visit. Snyder Pet. Ex. 11, pp. 39-430 40. See DORLAND'S at 642. Doctor Ward described E. coli as a \"stool organism.\" Snyder Res. Ex.431 K, p. 2. According to Dr. McCusker, the average child has six to 10 infections per year between six432 months and two to three years of age. During this time period, the child's immune system is learning to recognize and fight infections and to generate immunological memory. That memory allows the body to recognize and fight subsequent infections by the same pathogen without clinically apparent illness. Hazlehurst Tr. at 568A. Doctor Bradstreet testified that Colten was immunologically normal prior to his MMR vaccination, as did Dr. Kinsbourne. Snyder Tr. at 256A, 493A-94A. 214Videos of Colten take n between t hree weeks to 13 months of age were f iled a s Snyder Pe t. Ex. 31. Docto r Wiznitzer rev iewed all the videos and ide ntified se veral433 time periods a s reflective of som e developm ental pro blem s suggestiv e of ASD. The videos did not show Colten using lan guage or so unds, other than screech es and one syllable so unds such as \"b a\" or \"m a.\" T here was no interpersona l bab bling. The434 videos sho wed siblings app roach ing Colten and talking to him, but, according to Dr. Wiznitzer, Colten did not talk b ack to them the way a ba by would normally do. One video segme nt sh owed him , at about 7 months of age, with another b aby prese nt435 who was babbling. Colten was silen t. Snyder T r. at 637A. He loo ked at the camera and played with the lens cover, but had inco nsisten t resp onse s to voices. Sometimes he respo nded to his n ame, and sometimes he did no t. To Dr. W iznitzer, this raised a conce rn ab out Colten 's use of langua ge. Sn yder T r. at 638A. He te stified that the family repo rts tha t Colte n was using 15 -20 words at 15 months of age ref lected appropriate langua ge developm ent, if the words were be ing used for com municative purposes. Snyder T r. at 666A. In Dr. W iznitzer's opinion , based on the video evidence , Colten was not using w ords, merely syllables, at 13 months of age. Snyder T r. at 667A. Accordin g to Dr. W iznitzer, the re was not enough inf orma tion in the videos t o determin e if Colten had deficits in socia l skills prior to h is MMR v accina tion. Snyder T r. at 661A. Title 7 of the videos, taken when Colten was 11 months old, sh owed him being unresp onsive to his na me for a period of about 30 seco nds. At Title 8 of the video, when h e was thirtee n months old, he was also u nresp onsive to his na me. At Title 9, he was unresp onsive to a hug. At Title 10 , he was not looking at people, altho ugh he did go to h is father. O n Title 11 , he was unresp onsive to voice p romp ts and, on Title 13 , he ignored his siblings. A lthou gh the se videos were no t definitive evidence of a lack of social skills, Dr. W iznitzer called t hem suggestiv e of such a lack. Snyder T r. at 661A-664 A. There was no evidence on the pre-MMR vaccination videos of repe titive behavior. Sn at 665A. 4. MMR Vaccinat ion. Colten returned to Dr. Sah ai on April 23, 1 998, for his 1 5 month well- child visit. He rece ived his first MMR vaccine an d his fourth Hib vaccine a t this visit. Sn yder P et. Ex. 8, p . 115. Colten was described as a ppearing w ell. His he ight w as at the 95th perce ntile, his weig ht at the 50 percentile (25 p ounds, 1 4 ounce s), an d his hea dth The videos also included Colten from April, 1999, through slightly after his third birthday. 433 There was a 13-14 month gap in the video record that Mrs. Snyder explained was the result of Colten's behavioral symptoms during this time period. The gap included the period from two months before his MMR vaccination to the beginning of his speech therapy, which was in April, 1999. Mrs. Snyder testified that she had neither the time nor the inclination to record his behavior during this period. Snyder Tr. at 71A. Titles 6-14 of Snyder Pet.

Com menting on the previous E. coli inf ection in his pha rynx, Dr. Saha i recorde d Mrs. Snyder as st ating th at Co lten \"does eat poop.\" Snyder P et. Ex. 8, p . 115. The436 throa t cultu re taken at this visi t did not sho w any bacterial grow th (Sn yder P et. Ex. 8, p . 114). This was not surprising, in view of the antibiotics p rescribed at the April 7, 1998 visit. In the first not ation of any langua ge evaluation in Dr. Sa hai's reco rds, h e commented that Co lten had no signs of any recep tive lan guage disord ers. He did not comment on Colte n's expressiv e lan guage skills or no te any particular words or language b eing use d by Colten prior to the vaccination . Snyder Pet . Ex. 8, p. 115. Doctor S ahai recom mended a followup w ell-child vi sit in th e next three months. 5. Medical V isits f rom MMR Vaccinat ion to Hosp italization . During the four ng his MMR v accina tion, Colten had three visits to Dr. S ahai and two em ergency room visits, all f or prob lems similar to those he had previously experience d, including f evers, hiv es, gen eral f ussine ss, an d throat inflammation. See generally, Snyder P et. Exs. 8, p p. 96-113 and 11, p. 38. At trial, Mrs. Snyder's recollectio n of the sam e period was th followi ng the MMR v accina tion, Colten \"no t. He would scream all night lo ng.\" Snyder T r. at 48A. Acco suffering f rom fevers, no longer m aking eye con tact, and that \"he was just, h e wasn't rea lly there.\" Snyder T r. at 48A-49A. He h ad profuse diarrhea after his MMR v accina tion that never abated. Snyder T r. at 56A. This cha nge in b ehavior w as what ca used her to repeatedly bring Colten in to see the doctor. Snyder T r. at 49-50. She also te stified that the main re ason s she took him to the doctor o r the emergency room during th is period were b ecau se of his e xtremely hig h fever and her inab ility to conso le him . Snyder T r. at 76. Mrs. Noon an describe d Colte n as a \"d ifferent child\" b h ospita lization . Snyder T r. at 92. The medical reco rds do not sup port Mrs. Snyder's chara cteriz ation of the reaso ns for see king me dical a ttention for Colte n. Fever and fussine ss (cry ing and irritability) are th e only comp laints co mmon to both Mrs. Snyder's test imony and the medical reco rds be tween Colten 's v accina tion and his h ospita lization . At several points, th e medica l records a ffirmatively reflect th at Co lten did n ot have the sympto ms that Mrs. Sn yder testified that he demonstrat ed. For e xample, she describe d profuse In testimony, Mrs. Snyder vehemently denied that Colten ever \"ate poop.\" Snyder Tr. at 47A. 436 I credit Dr. Sahai's records over Mrs. Snyder's testimony in this matter, not only because of the quotation in the medical records and the E. coli positive throat culture from the April 7, 1997 visit, but also because of a notation in Colten's records that Dr. Sahai had discussed \"hygiene issues\" with Mrs. Snyder \"quite extensively\" after the throat exudate tested positive for E. coli. Snyder Pet. Ex. 8, p.113. 216diarrhea after his MMR v accina tion (Snyder T r. at 56A), but all th e reco rds from his visits up until the day of his h ospita lization either record him as h aving no diarrhe a or are silen t. See, e.g., Snyder Pe t. Ex. 8, p. 113 (\"no signs of vomiting, dia rrhea o r abdominal stre ss\"). As Colte n saw several dif ferent health care p roviders d uring this time , and none recorde d slee p disturba nces, scream ing, lack of eye con tact, or mental statu s cha nges (un til the day of his h ospita lization ), it is un likely that all o f the health ca re providers w ere sim ply indif ferent to Mrs. Snyder's repo rts. For t I rely prima rily on the contemporaneous m edica l records f Colte n's m edica l cond ition d uring this tim e frame . I emphasize that I do not questio n Mrs. Sn yder's veracity . She is a d evoted and caring paren t and I am confident that her testimo ny was based on her best recollect ion of this e xtremely diff icult an d stre ssful pe riod in her lif e. For m any y ears, Colten was a child who required co nside rable care, patience , and attention. Und erstan dably, it appears t hat her histories o f his illnesse s have conflated som e events. Occa siona lly, Snyder's chara cteriz ation of an b ecam e of a so mewhat revisionist medical h istory , and was the n relied upon by othe r doct ors. Thus, I rely primarily on437 the contemporaneous m edica l records f or Colte n's con dition . On Ma y 6, 1998, 13 days af ter his MMR v accina tion, Colten returned to Dr. Sahai. His m other repo rted that he was fussy and had increa sed crying, and decrease d appetite. Howev er, he was af ebrile with no vomiting, dia rrhea, or ab dominal d istress. On e xaminatio n, Dr. S ahai Colte th with erythema and \"little white patchy ex udates.\" His strep screen was negative, and he was described as438 neurologically normal. Docto r Sah ai inject ed Rocep hin, an antibiotic, a nd asked that Colten return in 1 0 days fo r ano ther throa t swab. T he record a lso con tains the followi ng notation : \"Hy giene issue s were d iscussed with m om quite e xtensively.\" Snyder P et. Ex. 8, p. 113. The lab re port for his t hroat swab sho wed norm al flora. Snyder Pe t. Ex. 8, p. 112. The follow- up visit occurred on May 19, 1 998, 26 days after his MMR v accina tion and 13 days after his Rocep hin in jection . The history taken at this visit indicate d that Colten had hives \"ab out a week a go\" af ter eating vanilla pu dding with m ilk, and Dr. For example, in the questionnaire she filled out for Dr. Bradstreet in May, 1999, she reported437 that in April, 1999, Colten became \"completely out of control\" in response to Augmentin, prescribed to him for cellulitis caused by an insect bite. Snyder Pet. Ex. 12, pp. 605, 643. Doctor Sahai did prescribe Augmentin, an antibiotic that Colten had previously taken without difficulty. Snyder Pet. Ex. 8, pp. 34, 60, and 77. Over the years, the adverse behavioral reaction became an \"allergic reaction.\" See Snyder Pet. Ex. 12, p. 253 (describing Colten as allergic to penicillin) and Snyder Pet. Ex. 33, p. 2 (describing a penicillin allergy diagnosed by allergy testing). There are no records of any allergy testing for penicillin. During his testimony, Dr. Bradstreet speculated that these \"patchy exudates\" were actually438 Koplik's spots. Snyder Tr. at 156-57. This is unlikely, given Dr. Ward's testimony that Koplik's spots do not occur in response to the measles vaccine. Snyder Tr. at 833A. I also note that this was not the first time Colten experienced patchy exudates in his throat and tonsils. See, e.g., Snyder Pet. Ex. 8, p. 118 (Colten's April 7, 1998 visit to Dr. Sahai, before his MMR vaccination). 217Sahai no ted that Colte n seemed to have som e milk intolera nce. He h ad an eye discha rge and a few healing insect bites on his leg. S nyder Pet . Ex. 8. p. 111. 439 Colten weighed 26 pounds, 2 ounce s, at this visit, accord ing to a later note by Dr. Sahai. Id., p. 92. On Me morial Day weeke nd, Colten 's family attended a family picnic. Mrs.440 Snyder de scribed Colten as ju st sitting on her lap. He d id no t play with his cousin s and siblings. Sn yder T r. at 52A, 90. Mrs. Noo nan him as \"u nresp rgic, pa Sn yder T r. at 91. Colte n visited th e emergency room on May 24 and May 25, a nd was admitted to the hospital o n May 26, 1998. Althou gh Mrs. Snyder describe d the hospita lization as ccurring bef ore Mem eeke nd (Snyder T r. at 52A), the dates o n the medica l records cle arly reflect th at he was hosp italized on the day af ter Mem orial Day, May 26, 1998. Five days af ter last seeing Dr. Saha i (and 31 days after his MMR v accina tion), on May 24, 1998, Colten Ormon d Mem Em ergency Room, with a histo ry of fever of 104 degrees o r higher f or three d ays. His tem perature at the emergency room was 101.1 degrees. He ha d a nonproductive cough an d was f ussy. He was gi ven another Rocep hin in jection and prescribed Tylenol or ibu profen for fever. He was also giv en a prescription for oral p enicillin. T he diagnosis was strep and right otitis m edia. Snyder Pet . Ex. 8, pp. 109-10. Colten went to the HMC eme rgency room the next morning, May 25, 1998, with continuing f ever and sore throa t. His te mperatu re rem ained high, ranging between 102 and 103 degrees. His app earance was \"no n-sep tic\" but his to nsils ha d a white exudate bilate rally. His tympa nic m embranes were \"ok.\" He appeared well- hydrated and neurologically intact. He was diagnosed with acute tonsillitis, to be treated with te pid baths, T ylenol, and incre ased fluid int ake. Snyder P et. Ex. 11, p. 38. Doctor B radstree t testified that Mrs. Snyder said Colten was sicker a fter his MMR ref . Snyder T r. at 152A. Her own testim ony was th at sh e continu ally raised his h ealth issues with his hea lth ca re providers, b ut that her co ncern s fell on deaf ears. Sn yder T r. at 78A-79. Howev er, Colte n saw several health ca re providers, inclu ding Dr. Sah ai, and none of them noted that any illness was significan t, up to the point Dr. Sa hai h ospita lized him, discu ssed immediately below. Mrs. Snyder's testim ony on this p oint is not sufficiently clear, cogen t, or com pelling to credit it over the contemporaneous m edica l records. Doctor Sahai associated this conjunctivitis with Colten's pharyngitis and the allergic reaction to439 milk products a week earlier. Snyder Pet. Ex. 8, p. 111. Colten also had conjunctivitis with his April 7, 1998 pharyngitis. Id., p. 118. I judicially note that in 1998, Memorial Day fell on May 25th.440 2186. Colten 's Hospita lization . Doctor S ahai saw Colten o n May 26, 1998, the day after his secon d emergency room visit, at his o ffice. He noted a temperature of 102.6, and two em ergency room visits over the last th ree d ays. In co ntrast to the Halif ax ER records f rom the day before, which d id no t mention sh aking, po or ap petite, se vere d iarrhea, and some vomiting, all of these were repo rted by his pare nts a s the sympto ms prom pting th e emergency room visit. Given th at he was describe d as \"well-hy drate d\" at the HMC emergency room visit, an d then dehydrate d at Dr. Sa hai's o ffice, it is likely that at least the diarrhe a and vomiting w ere rela tively new sympto ms, although Co lten was clea rly ill at both previous e mergency room visits. Doctor S ahai noted that Colte n appeared limp , dry, and easily acce ssible, which was unusu al. His a nterior fontanel was described as \"a lmost close d, su nken .\" Docto r Sahai also wrote that Colte n was a \"child with initia lly som e mild m otor dela y, but has done quite well since. ..Colte n appears flat let hargic, quiet, quite unnatural f or him . He is norm ally a quite active child.\" Snyder Pe t. Ex. 8, p. 99-100. He h ad mildly hyperactive bowel soun ds, a nd his th roat was inf lamed with enlarged t co vered with white pa tchy exudate s.

Do ctor W ard testified that the exudat ive pharyngi tis an d the elevated white coun t with a marked left shif t were consiste nt with a b acterial inf ection . Most of the elevation of Colten 's white blood cell coun t was cause d by an elevated number of neutroph ils, the white blood cells that respo nd to bacterial inf ection s. In a left shif t, the nucle us of the neutrop hils ha s no lobe s, ap pearing as a b and, which me ans that the neutroph il is y oung. This ele vated \"ba ndamia\" is indicat ive of an active ba cterial infection . The laboratory data was not co nsisten t with a viral inf ection because viral infection s do not produce an elevated band coun t. Snyder T r. at 972-73A.

On443 The nursing notes reflect that Colten slept from about 1400-1900 on the afternoon of his441 admission and was awake and crying or irritable from 2000-2300. Snyder Pet. Ex. 10, pp. 32, 34-35. The next day, May 27, 1998, Colten was half asleep at 0100, and slept from 0200-0400. He was awake and crying at 0400, and asleep from 0500-0800. He was alert from 0800-1600, fussy at 1700, resting at 1800, and alert at 1900. He was awake and irritable at 2000 and remained awake through 2300. Snyder Pet. Ex. 10, pp. 14-16. On May 28, 1998, the date he was discharged, Colten slept from 2400-0400, from 0500-0600, and from 0700-0900. He was awake and crying at 0400-0500 and awake from 0600-0700. Snyder Pet. Ex. 10, pp. 9-11. Mrs. Snyder's account to Dr. Bradstreet was given almost a year later, on May 11, 1999, when she stated that he had \"Non-stop screaming/crying during hospital stay. Sleepless nights started.\" Snyder Pet. Ex. 12, pp. 641-42. Her recollection is at odds with the nursing notes, although it is clear that Colten was irritable during many of the hours he was awake. Rotavirus is a common cause of gastroenteritis in infants and children. DORLAND'S at 1643. 442 According to Mrs. Snyder, by the time he was hospitalized, Colten had arrested his443 communication and was no longer playing with toys in a typical manner, instead favoring repetitive play. Snyder Tr. at 53A-54A. I adopt the accounts in the contemporaneous records, which reflect that Colten was still playing and communicating normally at the time of his hospitalization. 220discha rge, his neu rological exam was norm al, with no focal d eficits. Sn yder P et. Ex. 8, pp. 101-02. Colten was hospita lized on May 26, and discharged o n May 28, 1998, spending less th an 48 hours in th e hospita l. Howev er, on Dr. Bra dstree t's question naire, Mrs. Snyder ind icated that Colte n was hosp italized for four d ays, tw o weeks af ter his MMR vaccina tion. Snyder P et. Ex. 12, p. 634. In a report to a social worker, Mrs. Snyder indicat ed that Colte n was hosp italized for a week. Snyder P et. Ex. 15, p. 204. Accordin g to Dr. Brad street 's testim ony, Mrs Snyder told him that, at the tim e Colten was hospita lized, he had been ill for two w eeks. Snyder T r. at 159A-60. The contemporaneous reco rds ref lect a pproximately five da ys of fever prior to h is hosp italization . If Colten were a s ill as Mrs. Sn yder im plied for the two w eeks immediately preced ing his ho spitalization, the records of at least one of the three health care p roviders h e saw would surely have no ted an illness o f that duration . Doctor K insbo urne characterized Colton 's letha rgy prior to his h ospita lization as the beginning of the social withdrawal that is pa rt of autism's co re features. Snyder T r. at 528A-29B. Docto r Wiznitzer disagreed, testif ying that the term \"letha rgy\" had a particu lar clinical m eaning, a m ild dim inutio n or decrea se in level of consciousn ess, which is very different from the social withdrawal seen in autism . Snyder T r. at 631A- 33A. Lethargy as a result of illness a nd dehydratio n was a m uch more reaso nable explanat ion for Colte n's be havior at t hat point. Snyder T r. at 633A-34A . 7. Post-Hospitalization t o PDD-N OS Diagno sis. Doctor B radstree t testified that Colten never really recov ered from this illness. Snyder T r. at 160. Mrs. Sn yder testified that, after Colte n's relea se from the hospital, he continued to lose weight. S he describe d him as very cranky and fussy. He cried all night lon g. Snyder T r. at 52A. The medical reco rds pa rtially support and partially contradict h er testimo ny. After discharge f rom the hospital, Colten returned to Dr. Sah ai on June 2, 1998. At this po st-hosp italization check up , Colte n appeared to be doing \"quite well,\" an d Mrs. Snyder de scribed him as a lmost ba ck to norm al. His p hysical ex aminatio n was norm al, altho ugh his t hroat appeared to be mildly erythem atous. Base d on the recom mendation of the specialist w ho saw Colten in the hospital ( see Snyder P et. Ex. 10, p. 18), Colten was prescribed Bactrim for 30 days. Snyder Pet . Ex. 8, p. 94. On Ju ne 10, 1998, Colten was se en again b y Dr. Sah ai, th is time for two days of fever. His tem perature was elevated a t 102 degrees. His rig ht ce rvical ly mph nodes were slightly enlarged. Do ctor Sa hai re corde d a histo laste d a few days,\" but did not reco rd when it be gan. His throa t was note d to be mildly erythem atous and his tympa nic m embranes sh owed po or mobility bilate rally. Colte n weig hed 24 pounds, 13 ounces. Docto r Sah ai no ted that, in a little over a m onth, Co lten had lost a pound in weig ht. His kne es and ankle s444 appeared to be warme r, and Dr. Sa hai co nside red ju venile rheumatoid arthritis as a possib le dia gnosis. He suggested a consultat ion with a p ediatric end ocrinolo gist, indicat ing that Colten \"app ears quite ill and does not appear to be improving...\". He prescribed a ten day course of Augmen tin, a nother a ntibio tic. S nyder saw Dr . Ayode ji Otegbeye day, Jun e 11, 1998. His445 examina tion disclosed no joint swelling or redn ess, b ut he did find a faint skin rash on Colten 's trunk that appeared to be recu rrent. Colte n was describe d as som ewhat446 apathetic, wi th an intermitt ent dry cough. His n eurologic ex am showed no focal d eficits. At 17 months of age, Co lten had only a three word vocab ulary consisting on ly of names. Doct or Ote gbeye requested that Mrs. Sn yder ke ep a jou rnal o f four d aily447 temperature readings and that she note any mou th so res. His im pression was recurrent fevers w ith pharyngi tis, an d his differential dia gnoses in clude d cyclic Colten had actually lost more than three pounds since April 7, 1998, when he was recorded as444 weighing 27 pounds, 7 ounces. Snyder Pet. Ex. 8, p.118. He lost weight between April 7 and his MMR vaccination on April 23, 1998, when he weighed 25 pounds, 14 ounces. Snyder Pet. Ex. 8, p. 115. He regained some weight after the MMR vaccination, as he was recorded at 26 pounds, 2 ounces on both May 19 (Snyder Pet. Ex. 8, p. 92) and May 24, 1998 (Snyder Pet. Ex. 10, p. 43). His weight dropped by May 25, 1998, to 25 pounds, 9 ounces (Snyder Pet. Ex. 11, p. 38), reflecting the beginning of the gastrointestinal illness that caused his dehydration and prompted his hospitalization. His weight was not recorded during his hospitalization or at the June 2, 1998 followup visit, but by June 10, 1998, he had lost two pounds and four ounces since early April. Snyder Pet. Ex. 8, p. 92. Colten actually gained weight between his MMR vaccination and the emergency room visit two days before his hospitalization. Presumably, Dr. Otegbeye was the pediatric endocrinologist Dr. Sahai referenced, but none of445 the records reflect Dr. Otegbeye's specialty. A recurrent rash would be consistent with Colten's history of developing various rashes, many446 in apparent response to milk products. See, e.g., Snyder Pet. Exs. 11, p. 49; 7, pp. 58-60; 8, pp. 111, 129. This contemporaneous report of Colten's vocabulary contrasts with Mrs. Snyder's statements447 to Dr. Bradstreet that he had a large vocabulary and early speech. See Snyder Pet. Ex. 12, pp. 641-42. There was no indication in Dr. Otegbeye's record that Colten had recently lost words or expressive language in general. A three word vocabulary at 17 months of age is not typical. The MacArthur Communicative Development Inventory, a widely used scale to assess language and communication development in infants, indicates that most children have a 20 word vocabulary at 14-15 months of age.

Hazlehurst Tr. at 621A. A sedimentation rate test (sometimes referred to as an \"ESR\" or \"Sed Rate\") is a non-specific451 (non-diagnostic) test to detect acute and chronic infections. It is a measurement of how fast red blood cells in solution settle. Some diseases increase the protein content in blood plasma, causing the red blood cells to stick together, which in turn causes them to settle faster. In inflammatory autoimmune diseases, as the disease worsens, the sedimentation rate also worsens. Increased sedimentation rates are associated with renal failure, some forms of cancer, bacterial infections, and severe anemia, among other illnesses. MOSBY'S MANUAL OF DIAGNOSTIC AND LABORATORY TESTS [\"MOSBY'S LABS\"] at 233-35 (3d ed. 2006). A rheumatoid factor [\"RF\"] test is a nonspecific test. It may be elevated in autoimmune452 diseases, chronic viral infections, mononucleosis, and some bacterial infections, and is usually elevated in juvenile rheumatoid arthritis. MOSBY'S LABS at 462-64. Although one of Dr. Bradstreet's reports (Snyder Pet. Ex. 1 at 4) characterized an elevated RF as indicative of a measles brain infection, Drs. Zweiman and Ward both took issue with this statement.

She described Colten as linin g up toys and having inten se emotiona l reactio ns to change. repo rted that ng was hosp italized for tonsillitis-pharyng itis w ith a high f ever for seven d ays\" and that after antibio tic ad ministration , Colte n screa med for 22 out of 24 hours. In a slight co nflict w ith her ea rlier report th at Co lten lost co mmunica tion skills at 15 months, Mrs. S nyder also reported that he stop ped talking at the time of his hosp italization (Snyder Pe t. Ex. 13, p. 6), which act ually occurred when he was 16-17 months of age. Altho ugh he scored 36 on the Childho od Autism Ra ting Scale [\"CARS\"], which place d him in the mild to moderately autistic ran ge, Dr. W enk's diagnost ic imp ression was th at Co a pervasive developm diso rder, b of sympto ms nece ssary to meet the diagnost ic criteria f or autistic disorde r. Sh e reco mmended a number o f treatment and therapy options. Snyder Pe t. Ex. 13, pp. 5-8. Doctor B radstree t noted that Colte n had not made much progress be tween the March 19 99 evaluation and the August 1 999 evaluatio n. His scores o n the Vinelan d Adaptive Beh avior Scales were similar, a nd only slig htly improved b y August, 19 99, 227altho ugh he was five months older a nd had begun spe ech therapy f our m onths earlier. Snyder Pe t. Ex. 13, pp. 23 and 7; Snyder T r. at 182. C. Colte n's T reatm ent After PDD-NOS Diagnosis. 1. Speech Therapy. Ms. T imlin f irst saw Colten for spe ech therapy on A pril 13, 1999. She rem ained his th erapist un til he was discharged f rom therapy in May, 2002 . See Snyder P et. Ex.456 14, p. 2. She initially assessed Colten as h aving a se vere la nguage d elay. Sn yder T r. at 103, 109-10, 127, 136. She began te achin g Colten h ow to com municate , and teachin g his pare nts h ow to reinforce t he lesson s at home. Snyder T r. at 111. Colte n's be havior ma de this difficult. I n early session s, he would not sit a t the table a nd had to be cajoled into participa ting. His play w as rep etitive and ritualistic. He resp onded to interrupt ions in his playing w ith te mper tantrum s. She could not approach Colte n any closer tha n three to four feet withou t him moving away . Snyder T r. at 112-14. He would p ermit eye cont act if there were so mething he wanted, but would ot herwi se loo k sideway s and up and down the wall rath er than at her. S nyder T r. at 114. Ms. T imlin sa w Colten for 30 minute s of therapy tw ice a week. Initially , Colte n progressed slowly. She believed t hat the pace of Colten 's progress imp roved once he was placed on the gluten- a nd casein -free [\"GFCF\"] diet. Snyder T r. at 115-17. Accordin g to he r notes from May 28, 1999, Colten was on the GFCF d iet on that date. Snyder Pe t. Ex. 14, p. 67. Thereafter, Co lten appeared to be more co mpliant a nd less irritable. Snyder T r. at 116. Ms. T imlin t estified that upon review of her notes, sh e457 could see significa nt progress f rom one month to the next. Snyder T r. at 117. Colten 's imp rovement began in Ju ne, 1999. He b egan sp eakin g true words at that time. Snyder T r. at 117, 119-20. On June 1, 1999, he didn 't scream . The rings under his e yes were disap pearing and he was playing bet ter. On Ju ne 11, 1999, Colten did n ot display any ri tualistic beh aviors. Snyder T r. at 117. Not es from July 6, 19 99, reflected improved behavior, more smiles, an d incre ased eye con tact and parallel play. Snyder T r. at 120. She noted that she could \"be g[in] to see effects o f GFCF diet \" on July 27, 1 999. Snyder Pet . Ex. 14 , p. 65. These improvements all occu rred be fore Colten first saw Dr. Brad street . Colten received school-based language therapy until October 2003. Snyder Pet. Ex. 15, pp.456 172-73. He was dismissed from school-based speech therapy in May, 2007. Id., pp. 72-74. Other records reflect that milk and casein products were removed from his diet at the end of457 March, 1999, and gluten products were removed on May 9, 1999. Snyder Pet. Ex. 12, p. 642. However, Ms. Timlin's notes reflected that she first talked to Mrs. Snyder about the diet on May 4, 1999. Snyder Pet. Ex. 14, p. 67. 228At so me point, Ms. Timlin b ecam e aware that Colten was se eing Dr. Brad street , altho ugh she could no t reca ll exactly when. Snyder T r. at 118-19. She also be came aware tha t Colte n was receivi ng IVIG therapy, but she did not recall when t hat therapy began . Snyder T r. at 121. When Colten was about 34 months old, Ms. T imlin b egan t o see more im itation s of single w ords. In Octob er, 1999, she was unable to conduct a sco red e valuation of him, but reco rded the improvements she saw. Her no tes re flected that occa siona lly, and usually when he had a secret in inf usion , Colte n could a ppropriate ly use a three word se ntence. Snyder T r. at 121-23. By the e nd of Novemb er, 1999, she noted more e choic b ehavior, bu t Colte n was also p utting two syllables to gether t o form a word. By the end of Decem ber o f that year, Colten was sp ontaneously using w ords a nd phrases a nd respo nding to questio ns. Snyder T r. at 123-24. Ms. T imlin in dicate d that Co lten's p rogress by April, 200 0, was significan t and that it was rare for he r to se e that degree o f progress. He r only othe r experience with sim ilar progress w as with ano ther child o n the GFCF d iet. Snyder T r. at 124-25. She noted that, anecd otally, childre n with beh avioral issues a nd language disorde rs often improve their be havior if their language im proves. Sn yder T r. at 132. Most o f her patients improved their spee ch to the extent of their intellectu al an d cognitiv e abilities. S nyder T r. at 129. In Ma rch, 2 000, Colte n made spontaneous reque sts, with imp roved intelligibility in his sp eech . Snyder T r. 125-26. She reco rded that he had rece ived an IVIG treatment on the Wednesda y prior to this p articular se ssion. In her o pinion , the treatment had a positive ef fect o n his perf orma nce at that session . Snyder T r. at 126. Ms. T imlin was aware tha t there were tim es when Co lten was not receiving IVIG treatment for financial reaso ns, b ut sh e did no t document those periods. There were times when he became signif icantly f rustrate d during his spe ech therapy, and she attribu ted that to not rece iving IVIG, but this was not reflected in her no tes. Snyder T r. at 126-27. She admitted that she could no t track the ups and downs in Colten 's progress w ith th e dates of secret in or I VIG infusion s, except when her notes ref lected a treatment or a gap in the treatment. On August 11 and 22, 2000, she noted that Colte n was not himse lf, but she did not record any treat ment. On Decem ber 5 , 2000, she458 noted that his in telligibili ty was signif icantly clearer, with sim ilar not ation s on March459 He began chelation sometime between August 3 (see Snyder Pet. Ex. 12, p. 543, when458 prescription is dated), and August 7, 2000 (see id., p. 528, noting on August 14, 2000, that he had finished chelation a week earlier), but had difficulties with the chelation, as noted in Dr. Bradstreet's records. Id., p. 528, and discussion of the chelation treatment in Part C.3.b.(2)(c), below. He received secretin, and was prescribed a chelating agent on December 4, 2000. Snyder459 Pet. Ex. 12, pp. 508-09. 22920, 2001. On June 5, 2001, his b ehavior w as a prob lem, and, on June 12, 2001, she460 noted that he had an IVIG tre atment the day prior, th e circles u nder his eyes w ere decre ased , and his beh avior w as im proved. July 17, 2 001, was a pa rticular high po int beca use Colten was playing w ith im agination . On August 22 , 2001 and on Octo ber461 10, 2001, her notes ref lected more co mplex play strate gies. Snyder T r. at 134-35. 462 Ms. T imlin t estified that Colten had some significa nt peaks and valley s in h is progress, bu t her notes ref lected only one period of clear d ecline. She agreed that her notes ref lected a signif icant, stea dy improveme nt in Colten . Snyder T r. at 137. Given that Colte n was seein g Ms. Tim lin twi ce a week for therapy and making fairly stea dy progress, and that Colte n was receivi ng IVIG treatments at approximately six to eight week inte rvals an d secretin in fusion s monthly, it w ould not be unusua l for the treatments and speech improvements to coincide withou t any causal relat ionsh ip between the two events. Colten 's language skills be gan im proving after he sta rted spee ch th erapy. Ms. Timlin's n otes reflected by July , 1999. As Dr. W iznitzer testif ied, children with lan guage prob lems, whethe r or no t relat ed to an ASD, im prove w ith int ervention. How well the y respo nd to sp eech therapy is related to their lev el of intellectua l and cognitiv e abilities. S nyder T r. at 640A-41A . Colte n's cognitive pot ential was in the norm al ran ge, w hich gave him the capacity to im prove as m uch as he did. S nyder T r. at 641A-42A. A child with an IQ of only 50 would not have made the sam e improvements. Snyder T r. at 642A. 2. GFCF Diet. The GFCF diet involv es th e elimina tion of wheat and milk-based prod ucts f rom the diet. Colte n began t he diet shortly af ter he began se eing Ms. T imlin f or spe ech therapy. Accord ing to Ms. T imlin, she referred Mrs. S nyder to the mother of another of her p atien ts, who reco mmended the GFCF f ree d iet. Snyder T r. at 62-63. After spea king w ith th e other mother, Mrs. Snyder imm ediately placed Colten on the diet. Snyder T r. at 63. Acco rding to Mrs. Sn nd casein from his t mendation by his spee ch th erapist, wi \"very good Colten had last received an IVIG treatment on March 2, 2001. Snyder Pet. Ex. 12, pp. 492-96.460 Colten had received a secretin infusion on July 6, 2001, but was five to six weeks post his last461 IVIG treatment. Snyder Pet. Ex. 12, pp. 479, 485-87. Mrs. Snyder noted that Colten's performance and behavior generally deteriorated six weeks after IVIG treatment. Id., p. 266. Colten had received an IVIG treatment on August 6, 2001 (Snyder Pet. Ex. 12, pp. 473-76)462 and a secretin infusion on September 21, 2001 (id., p. 464), but he was over two months past his most recent IVIG infusion at the October 10, 2001 therapy session. 230respo nse.\" Snyder P et. Ex. 12, pp. 604-05.463 Mrs. Noon an testif ied that she saw mino r positive cha nges in Co lten's b ehavior after he was place d on the diet. She com mented that Co lten could become irration al if he ate so m uch as a small goldf ish cracke r. Sn yder T r. at 94. Colte n continu ed on the diet, and was still on t he diet at the time of the hearing. Sn yder T r. at 76. In Dr. W iznitzer's ex perien ce, im proveme nts o n the CFGF d iet are found only in those ch ildren who h ave milk o r gluten intoleran ce. Snyder T r. in his m edica l records. Snyder T r. at 675A. Testing suggested that Colte n rea cted adversely to gliadorphin (wheat), in a dditio n to milk. Sn yder P et. Ex. 12, p. 613. Acco rding to Dr. Wiznitzer, the diet did not treat his a utism ; it tre ated a food intolerance or allergy that was aggravating his b ehavior an d making him miserable . Snyder T r. at 675A. 3. Treatm ent by Dr. Bradstree t. Doctor B radstree t began trea ting Colten on July 28, 1 999, and was still treatin g him at the time of the hearing in Novemb er, 2007. Colte n's m edica l records with Dr. Bradst reet enco mpass o ver 65 0 pages over mo re than eight years, includ ing over 160 office visi ts, te lephone These records reflected464 office ts every four to eight w eeks throu ghout most of the period b etween m id-199 9 and August, 20 07, the date of the last m edica l record f iled. Doctor B radstree t's trea tments includ vari dietary ord ered numerous la boratory tests, m any of which were no n-stan dard tests not approved by the FDA, or ones performe d outside the U.S. He p erforme d several466 lumbar p unctures t o draw Colten 's CSF to test for measle s virus an d measle s The history form completed for Dr. Bradstreet indicated that milk and casein products were463 eliminated the end of March, 1999, and gluten products were eliminated on May 9, 1999. Snyder Pet. Ex. 12, p. 642. The end of March date conflicts with Ms. Timlin's records which reflect that she told Mrs. Snyder about the diet on May 4, 1999. Snyder Pet. Ex. 14, p. 67. These records do not include Dr. Bradstreet's hyperbaric oxygen treatments. Although the464 hyperbaric oxygen treatments are referenced occasionally in the other medical records (see, e.g., Snyder Pet. Exs. 7, pp. 22-24 and 12, pp. 1, 103), they were not furnished with the rest of the records from Dr. Bradstreet. Snyder Tr. at 278A-79. Snyder Res. Tr. Ex. 1 contains a list of medications and dietary supplements prescribed for465 Colten between 1999-2004. See also Snyder Tr. at 228A-37A (Dr. Bradstreet's testimony discussing some of the supplements). See, e.g., Snyder Pet. Ex. 12, pp. 249 and 529, and Snyder Pet. Ex. 207, pp. 3-6.466 231antibodies, a nd referred Co lten to a gastroen terolo gist fo r a co lonoscopy and gut biopsy. His rep orted diagno ses varied th roughou t Colte n's trea tment. He began with a diagnosis o f autism, yeast overgr owth, an d a fungal inf ection in (Snyder Pet . Ex. 12 , p. 583, in March, 2 000); autoimmune disea se not elsewhere classif ied a nd immune mecha nism disea se not elsewhere classif ied p. 353, in Decem ber, 2002); allergic gastroen teritis an d autoimmune disea se (id., p. 313, in March, 2 003); unspecif ied u gastroe nteritis, and colitis (id., 2003 ); distu rbance of sulph ur-bea ring amino acid metabolism, r imm une mecha nism , phalopathy unsp ecified (id., p. 206, in June, 2004); the sam e diagnoses in July, 2004, with the addition of \"rule ou t epilepsy, unsp ecified\" ( id., p. unsp isorder o f metabolism encep halopathy not e 164 in Ja nuary, 2005); and toxic ef fect o f mercury and its compounds, autoimmune disea se not elsewhere classif ied, and unspecif ied d isorder o f imm une mecha nism (id., p. 52 in September, 2006). Doctor B radstree t testified that the recorde d diagnoses varied, depending on the nature of the prob lem being treate d at that particular tim e. 470 Snyder T r. at 266-68. Doctor B radstree t's trea spee ch th erapy from July, 1999 through Ap ril, 200 3. Colten also saw his primary care pro vider a nd occasio nally saw specialists du ring this time frame . Exactly how Mrs. Snyder was ref erred t o Dr. Bra dstree t is un clear. Ms. T imlin I note that Dr. Wenk concluded that Colten did not meet the diagnostic criteria for autism,467 giving him a PDD-NOS diagnosis shortly after Colten's first visit to Dr. Bradstreet. Snyder Pet. Ex. 13, p. 7; Snyder Tr. at 184. Doctor Bradstreet's records do not reflect the use of any of the autism rating scales, such as the ADI-R, CARS, or ADOS; his diagnosis appeared to be based solely on his own observations and parental reports. Urticaria refers to a vascular reaction in the upper dermis, characterized by wheals. DORLAND'S468 at 1994. Colten was previously treated for hives by another provider (Snyder Pet. Ex. 12, pp. 431-34), and experienced a recurrence in this time frame. Snyder Pet. Ex. 12, p. 302. Doctor Bradstreet first testified that Dr. Thek, Colten's gastroenterologist, diagnosed him with469 colitis. He immediately qualified his testimony to reflect that the diagnosis might have been based on the symptoms he presented with that day. Snyder Tr. at 269A. Doctor Thek, Colten's gastroenterologist, never diagnosed colitis. See Snyder Pet. Ex. 36, pp. 1-2. His letter to Dr. Bradstreet, specifically stating that there was no evidence of colitis on pathology, was included in Dr. Bradstreet's records. Snyder Pet. Ex. 12, p. 292. This list is not exhaustive of the various diagnoses assigned to Colten throughout Dr.470 Bradstreet's treatment of him. 232testif ied that she referred Mrs. S nyder to another mother whose child was see ing Dr. Bradst reet. She admitted that she \"made suggestions th at he was available,\" b ut did not recall a ny direct ref errals to Dr. Bradst reet. Snyder T r. at that Colten th erapist told her that she \"nee ded to see Dr. Bradst reet\" and that she obtaine d his cont act in forma tion from the therapist. Snyder T r. at 60-61. The question naire she complete d for Dr. Brad street mentioned an Orlan do conference where Dr. Brad street suggested certain testing, and it also stated that Ms. T imlin \"educated her on the different cau ses o f autism\" a nd prom pted her to see Dr. Bradst reet while Colte n was still y oung. Snyder Pe t. Ex. 12, p. 644. Ms. T imlin's n otes did n ot mention a referral to Dr. Bradst reet. In the summary of Colten 's post -diagnosis a nd treatment provided below, I have focuse d primarily on those m atters eithe r directly or circumsta ntially relev ant to the issue o f causation . The records a re volumino us, a nd while I have rea d each medical record, schoo l record, and test repo rt sub mitted, I have not attempted to sum marize them all. a. Colten 's Initial T esting an d Assessm ent. Altho ugh Colte n did no t see Dr. Brad street until July 28, 1 999, his m other complete d a screen ing evaluation form for trea tment on May 11, 1 999. A number of laboratory tests were pe rforme d at the initia l screen ing v isit. In her paren t question naire, Mrs. Snyder de scribed Colten as h aving early speech and a large vocab ulary, w hich h e lost at approximately 18 m onths of age. She described his vocab ulary ex clusiv ely in terms of names (grandma, Krista, mama, dada). Sh e indicat ed that he stop ped playing w ith his siblings and had delayed m otor skills af ter 16 months of age. She listed chron ic \"loose stools\" as a conce rn, but noted471 communicatio n and behavior problem s as h er prim ary concerns. She had remo ved gluten a nd casein prod ucts f rom his die t after a recom mendation by his spee ch therapist, with a \"very respo nse.\" Mrs. Snyder de scribed her b elief that Colte n's problems were linke d to his m ilk allergy , a lot of antibiotic u se, a nd his MMR shot. 472 She recorde d that Co lten was hospita lized two weeks af ter th e MMR v t. Ex. 12, pp. 604-09, 633-35, 641-44. This report of delayed motor skills may reflect the left-side weakness Dr. Sahai observed at471 Colten's two year well-child visit. However, it contrasts with Mrs. Snyder's responses to a questionnaire she completed for enrollment in Florida's family support plan. On March 25, 1999, Mrs. Snyder listed under \"Colten's Strengths\" his motor skills, including his ability to climb, run, and jump well. Snyder Pet. Ex. 13, p. 15. Mrs. Snyder responded to a question on the form: \"Do you believe your child's symptoms are472 vaccine related?\" by circling \"yes.\" She then wrote in the comments about the MMR vaccine, milk allergy, and antibiotic use. Snyder Pet. Ex. 12, p. 642. Doctor Bradstreet testified that this question had been on his intake form for 10 years, and about 40-60% of his patients answered it \"yes.\" Snyder Tr. at 219A. The hospitalization actually occurred 33 days after the MMR vaccination. 473 233Colten had a number of tests during May , 1999, ing antif ungal se nsitivi ty, lysis, an d bacterial sensitivity testing. Sn yder P et. Ex. 8, p p. 21-27. An immune system p anel test was also pe rforme d which sho wed norm al IgG levels, low IgA sub class levels, and a very high IgE level. Sn yder P et. Ex. 12, pp. 618-22. 474 Allergy testing dem onstrated extreme react ivity to trees, grass, w eeds, an d mold. As Dr. Sah ai late r charact erized Colten 's allergy test results: \"Colten is allergic to th e Florida e nvironment.\" Sn yder P et. Ex. 8, p . 11. During his initial e xaminatio n of Colten , Dr. Brad street found him to be combative and agitate d. He was una ble to obtain vital sig ns or to ch eck h is height a nd weight. While Colte n made good eye cont act, it was fleetin g. He ha d social inte rest in his mother, but not in a nyone e lse. He was hyperactive, toe walking, an d engaged in self- stimu latory beh avior. His spee ch was limited to two or three words. In physical475 appearance, he was th in with dark circles un der h is eyes. Docto r Bradst reet's working diagnosis was au tism, overg rowth of yeast in h is digestiv e tract, and clostridia b acteria in his u rinary tract. Snyder T r. at 147-48, 181, 223A. His late r testim ony conf irmed476 that his d iagnosis was autism , in terms of the DSM-IV-TR, 299.00, diagnostic criteria, rathe r than the PDD-N OS d iagnosis he was lat er giv en by Dr . Wenk. Snyder T r. at 225A-26A . He be gan trea ting Colten initially int ravenous se cretin and Diflucan , and477 478 a variety of dietary supplem ents. He referred t o Colte n's yeast o vergrow th as \"dysbiosis,\" m eaning that atypical, a nd possib ly pathogenic, organism s were resid ing in his gastroint estina l tract. Snyder T r. at 185; Snyder P et. Ex. 12, p. 609. The laboratory report actually listed the IgA results in the \"within\" range column. Doctor474 Zweiman testified that this was a \"modestly decreased\" serum IgA level, not an IgA deficiency. Snyder Tr. at 588A-89A. Subsequent studies in other laboratories, including the Shands Medical Center laboratory at the University of Florida, showed normal IgA levels. Snyder Tr. at 589A; Snyder Pet. Ex. 33, p. 4. An IgA deficiency is associated with chronic and persistent sinusitis, ear infections, and pharyngitis, but not with an increased number of colds. Snyder Tr. at 587A-88A. Clearly, Colten's language development had plateaued, if not actually declined. In June, 1998,475 about one year earlier, Dr. Otegbeye had described Colten as having only a two to three word vocabulary. It does not appear that this laboratory actually grew bacteria from Colten's urine. Doctor476 Bradstreet testified he determined that Colten had bacteria in his urine, \"based on organic acid testing for metabolites from clostridium bacteria in his urine.\" Snyder Tr. at 148. The report identified the marker as increased dihydroxyphenylpropionic analog. Snyder Pet. Ex. 12, p. 640. Doctor Bradstreet testified that secretin is a neuropeptide, consisting of a sequence of 27477 amino acids, that \"has effects in the GI tract and the brain,\" and increases the \"outflow of pancreatic digestive enzymes.\" Snyder Tr. at 230-31A. Colten received numerous secretin treatments over the next eight years, with both Dr. Bradstreet and his parents ascribing positive results for the therapy. Diflucan is an antifungal agent. Snyder Tr. at 230. 478 234Doctor B radstree t described Colten as h aving one to three loo se watery stoo ls a day in July, 199 9. Snyder T r. at 185. This m et Dr. B radstree t's criteria f or a diagnosis of chron ic diarrhea , which w ould includ e loo se sto ols over a p eriod of time, usually fo r more than two weeks. S nyder T r. at 269A. The secretin treatment seemed to improve his sympto ms, as n oted by his m other, Dr. Brad street , family members, and his sp eech therapist. Snyder T r. at 186-87. Acco rding to Dr. B radstree t, in April, 20 00, when Colten first began receiving IVIG trea tments, yder T t prescribed the IVIG trea tments base d on the work of Drs. Gup ta and El-Dahr. Acco rding to Dr. B radstree t, Colte n479 the selection criteria f or IVI G trea tments based on his lon g history of \"imm unological dysr egulation \" and his h igh lev antibod ies to MBP. Docto r Bradst reet l prob lems, , and regression af ter 15-16 months of age, Co lten appeared to fit the regressiv e subset of children with autism . Doct or Brad street variously describe d Colten 's ition a Snyder T r. at 189A-90; Snyder P et. Ex. 12, p. 22. b. Types of Treatm ent Provided. Doctor B radstree t testified that Colten made a drama tic, an d highly unusua l, level of improvement while u nder his care. By six years of age, Co lten had normal language sco res, which represe nted a remarkab le reco very from the levels he displayed a t two and one-half years of age. Snyder T r. at 192-93A. The progress continued. Altho ugh Colte n sta rted the first gr ade classif ied a s developmentally delayed and langua ge imp aired (Snyder Pet . Ex. 15 , p. 145), at seven a nd one-half years o f age, Co lten's vocab ulary and sentence structu re was th at of a nine year o ld. Snyder T r. at 194A. Colten was rele ased from the developmental dela y classif ication on August 10, 2004. Snyder P et. Ex. 15, pp. 116, 125-26. Doctor B radstree t based his trea tment modalities on his view of what caused Colten 's cond ition. He n oted that Co lten was expose d to mercury in TCVs, both prior to, and at the time of, his MMR vaccination . Based on the imm unological records,480 the hospitalization, the subsequen t trea tment, and on other labo ratory testing, he Doctor Bradstreet may have been referring to Snyder Pet. Ex. 181, S. Gupta, Immunological479 Treatments for Autism, J. AUTISM DEV. DISORDERS 30(5): 475-79 (2000), in which Dr. Gupta discussed positive results from an unblinded trial of IVIG therapy. The article also referenced an ongoing double- blinded trial, using autism rating scales to measure efficacy. If the results from that trial, ongoing in 2000, were ever published, the paper was not filed as evidence in the Theory 1 cases. The parties stipulated that the level of thimerosal in the Hib vaccination Colten received at the480 same time as his MMR vaccination could not be determined. Jt. Stip., \u00b6 10. Although Colten apparently had few dietary sources for mercury ingestion, his mother testified that he occasionally ate tuna fish prior to his placement on a more restricted diet (Snyder Tr. at 76-77A). 235believed t he MMR v r. at481 195A. The dysregulate d immune system permitte d gut a nd brain inflammation. Snyder Tr. at 195A. The evidence for gut inf lammation came from biopsies ta ken during an endoscop y and a colon oscop y in May, 20 02. The evidence for brain inflammation was \"his overall cognitiv e abilities an d his respo nse to therapies t hat are anti-inflammatory in nature.\" S nyder T r. at 195A-196 . He believed t hat Colten had oxidative stress, and was ce rtain t hat he had persisten t measle s virus in h is CSF an d gastroin testin al tract . His imm une dysreg ulatio n, exposu re to antibiotics, and persistent virus led to an inability to manage p athogens in his gut. His the rapies for Colte n were de signed to address all o f these issue s. Snyder T r. at 196. A more d etailed a ccoun t of the testing performe d or ordere d by Dr. Brad street , the resu lts, an d interpreta tions of those resu lts is imm ediately below, f ollowed by an a ccoun t of Dr. Brad street 's treat ment regimen. (1) T esting. (a) Low IgA Levels. One and one-half months after his MMR v accina tion, Colten had a low serum IgA (24.9 , with a reference ran ge of 36-163 mg/dL a s normal). Snyder Pe t. Ex. 9, p. 5. Accordin g to Dr. Brad street , the level w as still low in July, 1999 , when h e retested Colten . Snyder T r. at 197. The actual test resu lts sho wed that Colte n's to tal IgA was within n orma l limits (38 mg/dL, with a re ference ran ge of 24-121 as n orma l). How ever, IgA sub classes (IgA1 and IgA2) levels w ere lo w (31 mg/dL of IgA1, with a reference range o f 48-378 and 6 mg/dL o f IgA2, with a reference ran ge of 13-91). Snyder P et.482 Ex. 12, p. 620. Docto r Zweiman testif ied that this was a \"m odestly decrease d\" serum IgA level, not an IgA de ficiency. Snyder T r. at 588A-89A . Doctor Zweiman did not think the se levels w ere o f concern. Snyder T r. at 587A- 89A. Another p hysici an, Dr. Von Elten, who rep laced Dr. Sah ai as Colten 's prima ry care p rovider, d id no t think th at these IgA levels w ere o f any clinical signif icance . He spoke with Dr. Bra dstree t about Mr. and Mrs. Snyder's request that he orde r the IVIG product. With regard t o this conversation , Dr. Vo n Elten's n otes stat subtype deficiency not clinica lly significa nt.\" The note does not reflect who m ade the The only witness who testified that Colten's immune system was dysregulated prior to his481 MMR vaccination was Dr. Kennedy. When asked if Colten had evidence for immune dysfunction and immune suppression prior to receiving his MMR vaccination, Dr. Kennedy's response was highly equivocal. He testified: \"I would say that there was some indication that it might have been possible.\" He relied on \"[s]ome reoccurring infections that appeared to occur, and some of the, the selective IgA that was just one point, but it's, it's not hard evidence but it's suggestive.\" Snyder Tr. at 366A-67A. When informed that Dr. Bradstreet had testified that Colten's immune system was not dysregulated prior to the receipt of the MMR vaccine, Dr. Kennedy deferred to his assessment. Snyder Tr. at 376. During the hearing, Dr. Bradstreet referred to Colten's high IgA levels, noting that the482 inflammation found on biopsy of gut tissue explained those \"high\" levels. Snyder Tr. at 210-11. This was apparently a misstatement, as he later referred to Colten's low IgA levels. Snyder Tr. at 216. 236conclu sion re garding the lack of clinical signif icance . Snyder Pet . Ex. 7, p. 54. Altho ugh th e context suggests it was Dr. Bradst reet (a con clusion also re ache d by Dr. Ward u pon read ing these notes (see Snyder Re s. Ex. K a t 8)), Dr. Bra dstree t testified that he did not so co nclud e. Snyder T r. at 283A. As th ese laboratory tests d o not appear in Dr. Von Elten's reco rds (Snyder Pe t. Ex. 7), the informa tion conce rning the IgA levels must have come from Dr. Bradst reet. An IgA test performe d in Janu ary, 2006, orde red b y Dr. Skod a-Sm ith, a n immunologist to whom Colten was ref erred, was norma l. Sn yder P et. Ex. 33, p. 4. Colten 's IgA levels w ere a lso no rmal in July, 200 7, in the only other serum IgA te st ordered b y Dr. Brad street . Snyder Pet . Ex. 12 , p. 18. (b) Hig h IgE L evels. Doctor O tegbeye did not test Colte n's IgE levels. In itial test ing initiated by Dr. Bradst reet showed a n extremely hig h IgE le vel (24 71 IU/m L with a ref erence ran ge of 0-164), ind icative of an allergic process. Snyder T r. at 197; Snyder P et. Ex. 12, p. 619. Doctor Zweiman characterized this re sult a s a st riking ly elevated serum IgE level, w hich Colten 's doct ors sho uld h ave f ollowed up with te sting to e nsure that there was no parasitic inf ection , which might h ave cause d his diarrhea . Snyder T r. at 618A-19A . There was no evidence th at Dr. B radstree t con ducted such follow up. A lthou gh he did stool testin g at th e initia l visit, the analysis did not includ e testing f or pa rasites. Snyder Pet. Ex. 12 , p. 611. Doctor Zweiman testified that another explana tion for Colte eosino philic gastroe nteritis, w hich is se en in childre n who ha ve food allergies or other react ions t o certain f oods, som ething Colten clearly demonstrat ed, both clinica lly and on the gut bio psies t aken in May, 20 02. Snyder T r. at 620A; Snyder Pet . Ex. 36 , p. 4. The only othe r IgE testin g, cond ucted on July 16, 2007, showed a level of 820 with the upper ran ge of normal a t 328. Snyder Pe t. Ex. 12, p. 18. (c) Ly mphocyte L evels. Doctor B radstree t cha racterized Colten 's lymphocyte levels as e videncing a persiste nt lymph ocytosis, or to o many w hite lymphocytes, which ind icated imm une dysregulation . Snyder T r. at 197. Doct or Ote gbeye's testing in Ju ne, 1998, showed 67% lymphocytes, with a n orma l range o f 18-56. Snyder P et. Ex. 9, p . 5. The June , 1999, results sh owed 62 % lymphocytes, with a re ference ran ge of 50-56%. Snyder Pet. Ex. 12 , p. 622. Colten 's lymphocyte levels w ere co nsisten tly high. See id., pp. 68- 70, 119-20, 245, 261, 403, and 470. They w ere lo w only on one test. Id., p. 36. (d) My elin B asic Prot ein A utoantibodies. Doctor B radstree t ordered MBP a utoantibody testing at Colte n's initial visit in July, 1999 (Snyder Pe t. Ex. 12, p. 609), and had Mrs. Snyder sign a co nsen t form for 237such testin g (id., p 632), but the sample was no t drawn until Jan uary, 200 0. Specialty Laborato ries repo rted his resu lt on January 25, 2000, as 46 EIA units, wi th a reference range f or no rmal o f less th an 10. Id., pp. 593-94. Mrs. Sn yder co uld n ot recall w hy the MBP te st was perf orme d. Snyder T r. at 79. Doctor B radstree t cha racterized Colten 's initial as wi th 585. Docto recom mended a course of IVIG trea tment to clear th e antibodies an d to treat Colte n's ele vated IgE le vel. S nyder Pet . Ex. Dr. Zw eiman, IVIG no t be an appropriate t herapy to trea t an anti- MBP a ntibo dy lev el of 46. Snyder T r. at 615A. Doctor Zweiman also noted that measu ring antibo dies a gainst MBP can be difficult. S nyder T r. at 574A-75A , 578-79A. It is a lso dif ficult to com pare findings f rom one measu reme nt techn ique to another. Testing f or MBP h as not been stan dardized, as th e primary use f or an ti-MBP test s is in rese arch, rathe r than clinical ca re. S nyder Tr. at 580. Anti-MBP ant ibodies ha ve been repo rted in pa tients with ASD an d in patients with neurodegen erative disea ses o r epilep sy, with vary frequency. So me repo rts483 indicat e that 50-60% of ASD p ha ve such antibo dies. Anti-MBP an tibod ies ha ve been found in 62% of individuals with mu ltiple sclero sis and in about 50% of those with active rheu matoid arthritis. Ho wever, ant i-MBP ant ibodies ha ve also be en found in about 25% o f individuals without any clinical disea se, a nd thus elevated anti-MBP levels are n ot always a sign of neurologic dysfu nction . Snyder T r. at 580-82A. There evidence that anti-MBP an tibod ies are asso ciated with any path ology in ASD pa tients. injectin g anti-MBP int o experim ental an imals doe s not induce neurologic disease , there is no consensu s on the clinical relevance , if any, of anti-MBP an tibod ies. S nyder Tr. at 582A-53 A. An MRI can show dem yelinat ion in condition s like m ultiple sclerosis, b ut demyelinat ion is n ot se en in au tism. Snyder T r. at 577A-78. Colte n's MRI, p erforme d in Jan uary, 200 6, showed n o evidence of demyelinatio n. Snyder Pe t. Ex. 33, pp. 9-10. Because normal in dividuals ma y have antibo dies a gainst MBP, and such antibo dy levels are highly variable, it is d ifficult to draw conclusio ns from Colten 's test results. Snyder T r. at 578-79A. Doctor Zweiman noted that the particular study finding anti-MBP antibodies in those with483 epilepsy that he relied upon was careful to exclude those with ASD from their sample of epileptics. Snyder Tr. at 603A. An immunologist who evaluated Colten in 2005 also noted that anti-MBP antibodies are484 suggestive of central nervous system inflammation and damage, but not specific of such disorders. She was informed by Colten's parents of his high MBP levels; she was unaware that Colten's subsequent MBP tests were generally normal. Snyder Pet. Ex. 33, p. 19. 238On the date Colte n began I VIG therapy, March 8, 2000, Dr. Brad street orde red another test of his a nti-MBP level. The report was negative. It in clude d the485 comment: \"There was no sign of autoimmunity to bra myelin... .\" Sn yder T r. at 243A- 44; Snyder P et. Ex. 207 , p. 1. Over the n ext six years, Colten 's bloo d anti-MBP a ntibo dies re mained within t he norm al ran ge of 10 or below, except f or on e test on Octo ber 9 , 2002, when the level was 14. Snyder Pe t. Ex. 12, p. 469 (4, on August 6, 2001); p. 357 (14 , on Octo ber 9 , 2002); p. 345 (4, on Decem ber 1 9, 2002); p. 189 (4, o n July 28, 2004); and p. 81 (5, on April 24 , 2006). Docto r Zweiman noted that anti-MBP levels are variable. Snyder T r. at 616A. The only test f or MBP in Colten 's CSF, dra wn on April 17, 2002, was also negative. S nyder Pet . Ex. 20 7, p. 2. Antibod ies against MBP in the CSF would be more direct evidence of damage to t he white matter o f the brain than finding such antibodies in b lood serum . Snyder T r. at 585-86A. In sp ite of repe atedly norma l anti-MBP tests, apparently Colten's p arents still thought h is ant i-MBP ant ibodies were high in March, 2007. At his 1 0 year che ck up , they repo rted that he had anti-MBP a ntibo dies t o his prima ry care physician, a nd attempted to get his IV IG tre atment for them resta rted. Snyder P et. Ex. 7, p . 6. Apparently Dr. Brad street thought th ey were st ill high as well, becau se a note, dated in March, 2 007, in the records o f Colten 's family pract ice ph ysician co mmented: rotein Id., p. 3. A later-dat ed note reco rded that a request f or the IVIG had been sent to another o ffice for proce ssing. Id. Doctor B radstree t ascribe d the need for IVI G therapy to Colten 's ant i-MBP levels. How ever, the re is no evidence that eith er the wild-type m easle s virus or th e vaccine strain measles virus indu ces th e forma tion of anti-MBP an tibod ies, d espite extensive study. It is not a reliable m arker f or measle s infection in th e brain. Snyder T r. at 583A-86A. (e) Mercury Testing. Snyder Res. Tr. Ex. 3, p . 7 is a ta ble that captures the mercury testing perf orme d on Colten over mo re than six years, me asuring m ercury in the hair, b lood, and urine. For reaso ns se t forth below, I co nclud e that none of these te sts de monstrat ed excess mercury in Colte n's bo dy. These results were dated September 21, 2001, and involved a different testing technique. 485 There was no explanation of why the testing process took over 18 months. Snyder Pet. Ex. 207, p. 1; Snyder Tr. at 585, 613A. 239(i) Hair Mercury Test. Colten 's first me rcury test was a hair test, cond ucted on April 29, 2000. Snyder Pet. Ex. 12 , p. 575. Hair tests measure exposure to organic m ercury, primarily ethyl or methylmercury. Th e hair closest to the scalp captures t he level of mercury in the blood within a month of the time the hair w as cu t. The rema inder of the hair strand provides informa tion regarding historical e xposu re. S nyder T r. at 759-60A. Hair m ercury lev els reflect circulat ing blood levels of mercury at the time of hair growth, not the level of mercury in tissu e (bo dy burde n). S nyder T r. at 761-62. The April 29 , 2000 hair te st for mercury dem onstrated a low level of mercury in Colten 's hair, b ut one within t he reference ran ge of normal f or the lab orato ry, and one well be low the 90 percentile for U.S. children ages six to eight. Snyder T r. at 762-65A;th Snyder Pe t. Ex. 12, p. 575; Snyder Res. T r. Ex. 3, p . 4. Alth ough Co lten was a little over three years o f age a t the tim e of the test, the U.S . norms f or old er children help to place this re sult in context. Given Colten 's exposure to mercury through T CVs, Dr. Brad street expecte d this hair m ercury lev el to be higher. He th ought the low test resu lts ref lected a problem in excreting m ercury, rather th an low body lev els of mercury. Snyder T r. at 270A-71A . This inverse correlat ion b etween h air me rcury and mercury body burde n was base d on Dr. Holme s' work (Cedillo P et. Ex. 55, Tab X, discussed , supra , Section V, Part C.2.c.(3 )(b). Snyder T r. at 247A. Doctor McCab e disagreed with Dr. Bradst reet, testifying that this re sult would b e expected from Colten 's diet (which d id no t includ e fish), an d from the small am ount of thimerosa l cont ained in Colten 's vaccine s. He also n oted that it was co nsisten t with the levels of mercury fo und in Colte n's blo od. Snyder T r. at 763. (ii) Urine Mercury Levels. Colten 's first urine t est for mercury ex posu re was a post-provocation challenge test cond ucted on July 21, 2000. Snyder T r. at 197, 246, 272A. Prior to co llecting the urine, Colten was administered 100 mg of DMSA, a chelating agent . See Snyder P et. Ex. 12, p. 544 (upper right corne r of repo rt). T he results were repo rted by Doctor's Data laboratory as \"v ery elevated ,\" at 11 \u00ecg/g creat inine. Id.; Snyder T r. at 272A-74. 486 Converting this f igure to p arts p er billion (\u00b5g/L) w ould yield a result of 2.2 \u00ecg/L of urine . Snyder T r. at 770-71A. No b aseline urina ry mercury lev el was rmine d before administration of the chelating agent . Snyder T r. at 274. However, the reference ran ges f or this test were b ased on subjects who were This test measures a mercury ion in the urine, and is reported as \u00ecg/g creatinine, which is a486 different measurement than \u00ecg/L. Snyder Tr. at 770. 240not chelated before m easu reme nt of their urinary mercury lev els. S nyder Pet . Ex. 12 , p. 544; Snyder T r. at 769A, 771A-72. Based on Dr. W oods' resea rch, urina mercury levels in ad ults n ot occupa tiona lly exposed to mercury were 3 .0 \u00ecg/L, pre - chela tion; Colten had a st-chela tion. ough t he Doctor's Dat a laboratory reported Colten 's results a s \"very elevated ,\" applying the correct re ference range p laced Colten 's post -chelat ion m ercury lev el in t he range o f normal p re-chelat ion levels. Snyder T r. at 771A-72. Doctor McCab e's te stimo ny was also sup porte d by an article f iled a s Cedillo Re s. Ex. L, T ab 5. This stu dy looked at chela tion as a method to assess \"bo dy burde n\" of488 mercury . Hea lthy adults were tested for mercury lev els, a nd then took a chelating agent. Baseline urinary mercury av eraged 2.2 \u00b5g/L o f mercury. Post-che lation mercury levels w ere a n average o f 13.7 \u00b5g/L. B ased on this sm all stud y, Colte n's po st-chela tion mercury level app eared to be low, not e levated. The study also demonstrated why no post-chelat ion n orms have be en established for children . On e of the 15 adults recruite d for this stud y suffered a se rious rea ction to the chela ting agent, and the stu dy was terminate d after only one ro und of chelation . A post-che lation urine sam ple, taken on April 24, 2006, repo rted that any mercury prese nt was be low the detectio n lim it. Snyder Pet . Ex. 12 , p. 86. Another post-chelat ion u rine sa mple, ta ken on June 26, 2008, was rep orted by ano ther laboratory as w ell be low the reference ran ge for mercury. Id., p. 70. Another p ost- chela tion urine sample, taken on September 2 5, 2006, found no detectable mercury. Id., p. 48. (iii) Blood Mercury Levels. Colten 's bloo d mercury lev els were teste d on five occasion s, all with f indings in the normal ra nge. S nyder T r. at 757-58. A blood sam ple d rawn on September 2 1, 2000, was test ed for mercury on Se ptember 26 , 2000. The mercury level of 3 \u00ecg/L w as well within t he reference ran ge. Sn yder P et. Ex. 12, p. 530. Colte n's blo od mercury levels w ere m easu red o n Dece mber 10 , 2004, April 29, 2 005, and June 26 and Decem ber 1 1, 2006. All of the results were lo wer than the reference lim it of 10 \u00b5g/g,489 Doctor Woods was originally listed by the PSC as an expert witness for petitioners, but he did487 not file an expert report or testify. See Petitioners' Initial Disclosure of Experts, filed February 14, 2006, OAP Master file. His work was relied upon by Dr. Bradstreet. Snyder Tr. at 251-52A. G. Archbold, et al., Dimercapto-succinic acid loading test for assessing mercury burden in488 healthy individuals, ANN. CLIN. BIOCHEM. 41: 233-36 (2004). The 10 \u00ecg/g level was the upper limit of normal. There was no lower \"normal\" limit listed. 489 241even th ough t hey w ere a ll post-ch elatio n tests. The blood mercury lev els m easu red490 recen t exposu re, which, in Co lten's ca se, would h ave bee n very limite d due to his diet and his p arents' ref usal t o administer a ny additio nal vaccines. Snyder T r. at 246-47A, 763. (iv) Urinary Porphyri n Testing. Accordin g to te sting don e at the Laboratoire P hillippe August in France , Colte al urina ry porphyri ns nsisten t with mercury ex posu re. S nyder T r. at 216. Doctor B t inte rpreted Colten 's porp hyrin test resu nsisten t with his oth er obse rvation s tha t Colte n demonstrated low lev els of thiols, cystine, an d glutat hione, and he was probably not a good excreter of mercury. Doctor Bra dstree t explaine d that the ratios b etween ce rtain t ypes of porphyri and Colten 's preco porphyrin level w as He b ased this interp retation o n work by Drs. W ood, Nata f, and Ge ier. Sn yder T r. at 251-52A. Urinary porphyri n testing represe nts a \"work in p rogress,\" according to Dr. McCabe. Preco proporphyrin appears to b e a marker of urina ry mercury in those491 occup ation ally exposed to high levels of elem ental or methylmercury, but there is no data on those with int ermitt ent exposure to TCVs. S nyder T r. at 774-75A; Snyder Re s. Ex. T a t 5. Colten 's preco proporphyrin test results were so mewhat incon sistent . On September 1 5, 2006, his le vel was 31.7 nmol. O n July 27, 2006, his p recop roporphyri n level w as 24.6, with a reference ran ge of 2-5. On July 26, 2 007, the level ha d risen to 30, in sp ite of several roun ds of chelation between the latte r two tests. S nyder Pet . Exs. 207 , pp. 3, 8 and 12, p. 58. These test results conflicted with the urine , hair, and blood tests, a ll of which sh owed low or und etectable levels of mercury. Doctor McCab e noted that Dr. W oods found two po rphyri ns, p recop roporphyri n and pentacarbo xyporphyrin, th at appeared to equate to other measu res of mercury exposure (comp aring porph yrins to urinary mercury lev els). Colte n's urine was high in both. However, Colten was also high in two other porph yrins, he ptacarbo xyporphyrin and hexacarb an unusual p rofile. Given Colte n's m any roun ds of chelation , Dr. McCabe was highly skep tical th lten's p orphyrin test ing represe nted resid ual m ercury in his bo dy. He no ted that Dr. W oods' work demonstrated that che lation lowered urina ry preco proporphyrin levels \"precipitou sly.\" The highest blood mercury level was .002 \u00ecg/g on December 10, 2004. On April 29, 2005490 and on both June 26 and December 11, 2006, Colten's blood mercury was .001 \u00ecg/g. Snyder Pet. Ex. 12, pp. 172, 130, 70, and 39. Precoporphyrin is a different porphyrin than precoproporphyrin. In his testimony, Dr.491 Bradstreet referred to precoporphyrin to illustrate what he saw as problems in Colten's mercury excretion. See Snyder Tr. at 251-53A. Doctor McCabe testified about Colten's precoproporphyrin level in discussing Dr. Woods' pioneering work in porphyrin testing. Snyder Tr. at 774-80A. 242Snyder Res. Ex. T a t 5; Woods 1996, Snyder Re s. Ex. T , Tab 4, at 214. (f) Measles V irus Ant ibody Testing. Measles virus an tibod y testing me asure s exposure to measles virus w hether from natural inf ection or from vaccine . A positive test resu lt for measle s IgG an tibod y would be expecte d in someone who ha d been vaccinated within t he prior two y ears, and would be indica tive of an appropriate im mune respo nse to the vaccine . Ced illo T r. 2781A-82 A. From a blood sam ple d rawn on March 8, 2000, Colten tested positive492 for bo th measle s virus an IgG, ref lecting MMR v accina tion years earlier, a nd some natural exposure to herpes virus. Snyder T r. at 198, 242A-43 A,493 371A-72A ; Snyder P et. Ex. 207 , p. 1. However, by March, 20 02, Colten did not have detectable levels of antibod ies to measles virus, MMR, or herp es vir us in his CSF, which Dr. Brad street attribute d to two years o f IVIG trea tments. Snyder T r. at 198. Later, Dr. Bradst reet elaborate d on this testim ony, stat ing that the absence of measle s virus an tibod ies in Co lten's CS F in 2002, \"needs to be interp reted in th e light of his p revious t herapy.\" Snyder T r. at 240A. He agreed that most b atches of IVIG would ha ve signif icant levels of anti-mea sles vir us antibodies. Snyder T r. at 241A. 494 Acco rding to Dr. W xplanation that IVIG tre atments cau negativ e resu lt for measle s antibod ies was persu asive. If Colten had a persiste nt measle s infection and manufactured a ntibo dies t o the measle s virus as a result o f either that infection or his vaccina tion, he would not cea se m anufacturing them simp ly because he had an IVIG tre atment. Snyder T r. at 947-48A. A negative m easle s antibody test would be incon sistent with an active, persisten t measle s infection . Ced illo Tr. at 2787. This was also the date of Colten's first IVIG treatment. Snyder Pet. Ex. 12, p. 582; Snyder Tr.492 at 243A. For reasons unclear in the record, the sample, collected on March 8, 2000, was not reported493 as positive until September 24, 2001. This report was not contained in the updated records from Dr. Bradstreet filed in July, 2007, although the report is dated September 24, 2001, and was addressed to Dr. Bradstreet. Snyder Pet. Ex. 207, p. 1. This exhibit was filed on October 26, 2007, shortly before the hearing began. According to Dr. Ward, the FDA requires that all IVIG formulations contain a minimum level of494 measles neutralizing antibodies, but the levels vary widely above that amount, depending on the source. If Dr. Bradstreet were using IVIG to treat a persistent measles virus infection, he should have selected the lots containing the highest levels of measles antibodies. Snyder Tr. at 944A-45A. Doctor Bradstreet testified that the titer of anti-measles virus antibody was not a consideration in his selection of IVIG batches. Snyder Tr. at 240A-41A. 243(g) End oscop y and Colo nosco py Results.

He f ound more e osino phils in the duodenum. In inal ileu m, he found \"prom inent lympho id tissue \" with a hyperplast ic follicle w ith a large germina l center on one sample. He also found two large collectio ns of eosinop hils.

However, intraepithelial eosinophils are not evidence of an inflammatory bowel disease, and are found in developmentally normal children. Increased eosinophils in the gut appear to be a consequence of constipation, with increased inflammation in the gut wall caused by impacted stools. Hazlehurst Tr. at 621A-23A, 628A; Hazlehurst Res. Ex. A, Tab 15, Table 2. This exhibit is not on letterhead, so there is no indication where Dr. Anthony practiced at the496 time of the report. Although there is a fax machine header, with a date/time entry (04 Sep 2003) there is no indication who faxed the document, to whom, and from where. The signature block on the report is \"Dr Andrew Anthony MRCPath (by published works)\" A review of the exhibits filed in the Theory 1 test cases disclosed that Dr. Anthony was a co-author of several of Dr. Wakefield's articles (see, e.g., Snyder Pet. Exs. 120 and 186; Cedillo Pet. Exs. 61, Tab NNN and 63, Tab T; and Cedillo Res. Ex. T, Tab 32. He was one of Dr. Bradstreet's co-authors on the Bradstreet 2004 article, filed as Cedillo Pet.

I note that Co lten's I gA lev els were never high, an d it is likely Dr. Bradst reet simp ly misspoke , meaning instea IgE le vels. (h) T esting f or Measle s Virus RNA. Base d on rep orts f rom Dr. O'Lea ry's labo ratory, Unigenetics, t hat measle s virus had been detected in the gastrointe stinal t ract o f som e children with au tism, Dr. Bradst reet thought it was logical to co nfirm his su spicion of a ca usal re lation ship between the MMR v accine and onset of Colten 's symptoms. He traveled to Dublin to meet Dr. O 'Leary to ask if CSF sho uld b e tested for the presen ce of the measle s virus, and to find ut wheth er Unigene tics cou nt. Docto r O'Lea ry gave him a tour of the labo ratory and explained the collectio n, sh ipping, a nd testin g proced ures.

Colten 's CSF an d blood sam ples were drawn in Dr. Bra dstree t's of fice on April 17, 2002, and shipped to Unigenet ics. T he CSF sam ple was repo rted back as positive for measle s virus at 3.7 x 10 copies pe r nan ogram o f total RNA. Snyder Pe t. Ex. 12, p.4 419. Colte n's blo od sample tested negative f or the presen ce of measle s virus. Id., p. 417 (dup licates o f these rep orts a ppear at several oth er pla ces in the record). Both reports w ere d ated June 5, 2002. Id., pp. 417, 419. These repo rts are what Dr. Rim a called \"headline reports\" in tha t they simply reported the results withou t explaining ho w the copy numbers w ere co mputed. See Snyder T r. at 929-30. A termina l ileal bio psy, collected during Dr . Thek's e ndoscopy and colon oscop y of Colten on May 30, 2 002, was receiv ed by Unig enetics on Decem ber 1 2, 2002.

Ex. 12, p. 390. Petitione rs' ex pert, Dr. Ken nedy, testified that this re sult was quite low, and was only com fortab le with ca lling the gut b iopsy results \"indet ermin ate.\" Snyder T r. at 379A-82A . 498 A possible explanation for the delay in sending the biopsy to Unigenetics appears at Snyder497 Pet. Ex. 12, p. 352, indicating that on December 6, 2002, Dr. Bradstreet discussed Colten's case with Colten's attorney, and would send samples of Colten's CSF and bowel biopsies to either Unigenetics or another laboratory within a week. If a second CSF sample was sent to Unigenetics at the same time as the gut biopsy, there is no record of the results from it. In testifying in Cedillo, Dr. Kennedy reported some concern about Unigenetics' results showing498 low copy numbers. Cedillo Tr. at 1815-17. In his testimony in this case, he appeared to retreat from his concern about samples with low copy numbers, and suggested that Colten's gut biopsy might be a \"low positive,\" based on his supposition that the blood sample was assayed at the same time as the gut sample. Snyder Tr. at 379A-80A. However, the blood and gut biopsy specimens were tested on different dates and could not have been run concurrently. See Snyder Pet.

Ex. 1 con tains a list o f the dietary supplem ents Colten received between 1999-2004. Syclovir, plem ent, was recom mended by Dr. Kartzinel, on e of Dr. Brad street 's partn ers, to treat inflammatory changes in the digestiv e tract. S nyder T r. at 230. During cross-examina tion, Dr. Brad street iden tified some of the other sup plem ents and explaine d why they were p rescribed. He id entified alpha lipo ic acid prob iotic. S nyder T r. at 232A-33.

Snyder T r. at 233. He identified taurine as a neutral a mino acid ntial the forma tion of bile salts, a nd explained that it had been observed to calm and ease behavioral sy mptoms. Snyder T r. at 234A. He ind icated that he prescribe d it fairly frequent ly. Withou t his perm ission, a com pany that manufactured it (Kirkman Laboratory) used him as a testim onial for its e fficacy. Doctor ry was ting rine f use in tre ating tistic pa tients withou t any scient ific the claim , and ran into prob lems with th e FDA a s a re sult. Snyder T r. at 234A-35A .

S nyder Pet . Ex. 12 , p. 515. The nutritional su pplements p rescribed by Dr . Brad street were a lso sold by Dr. Bradst reet. His test imony on whethe r this was a p rofit-makin g ente rprise w as somewhat equivocal. A fter first testif ying that his co rporatio n made \"app roximately nothing\" f rom \"essent ially no mark-up a t all\" T r. at 237A), he gave a nonresp onsive an swer to the next questio n, co ncern ing any prof it from the sale of dietary supplem ents. Rat her than answering y es or no, he com mented that he often \"gav e supplements a way to f amilies in ne ed.\" Snyder T r. at 237A. Colten 's experience s with nutrition al sup plem ents were n ot always benign. On Octob er 26 , 1999, what appears to b e a telephone consu ltation with a nurse in Dr. Bradst reco rded that Colte n was irri table, th rowing tem per tantrums, not sleep ing throu gh the night, a nd having recurrent d iarrhea.

T his en coun ter note indica ted that every time Colte n was place d on a supplement, he would respo nd with inco ntine nce or po or be havior; the health care 247provider's respon se was to re commend a decrea se in the dose of supplem ents to one- fourth and to start them one at a tim e. (b) Secret in. Secret in therapy appeared to be the intervention Co lten received th e lon gest, beginnin g on Colte n's first v isit w ith Dr. Bra dstree t in Ju ly, 1999 (Snyder Pet . Ex. 12 , p. 608), and continu ing throu gh Februa ry, 2007 (id., p. 30). He t ook several f orms of secretin , beginning w ith int ravenous se cretin, and, in A pril, 20 05, he began to use nasal secretin in co mbinatio n with intravenou s secret in. Id., p. 135. Accordin g to Dr. W iznitzer, secretin does not work as a t reatm ent for au tism. Snyder T r. at 675A.

Secretin m ight have som e positive ef fect o n bowel problem s, bu t not on the core sympt oms of autism. Snyder T r. at 676A-77 A. His testim ony w as buttressed by Dr . Coo k's in Cedillo. Doctor Co ok te stified that he was one of the resea rchers involv ed in clinical trials o f secret in as a therapy for autism. Three case repo rts suggested that secre tin m ight be effective, an d he was v ery excited ab out the prosp ect o f a drug treatm ent for au tism. Secretin was test ed against saltwater in a blind ed study. The initial da ta indicate d that the children were b etter after the stud y. When the stud y was ed, however, tho se rece iving saltw ater actu ally did slightly bette r than the children rece iving secretin. The study itself provided hope to families strugg ling w ith th is illness, b ut se cretin t herapy prov ed less ef fective tha n the place bo. Ced illo T r. at 1474A-77 . Nevertheless, Mrs. Snyder w as adamant that the secretin t herapy helpe d Colten 's aut as well as h is gastrointe stinal o nes. She testified that, after beginnin g secretin, Colten began slee ping thro ugh th e night. His diarrhe a did no t entirely go away , but it was mu ch better, and she began t o see more e ye contact an d fewer tantrum s. Snyder T r. at 64-65. Most o f Mrs. Snyder's com ments in Colten records co ncern ed Colten 's digestiv e issue s. See, e.g., Snyder Pe t. Ex. 12, pp. 294 (sto ols be tter forme d post-secret in); 17 3 (secret in he lping with bowel fo rmation); 1 54 (bowels loose; needs Secref lo [se cretin]); 1 38 (stools f ine after se cretin); 1 25 (able to tolerat e additio nal fruits an d vegetable s while o n nasal secretin ); and 76 (bo wels be tter a fter se cretin in fusion ). Howev er, sh e also at tribute d good b ehavioral ef fects t o secretin. See, e.g., id., pp. 466 (no ting beh avioral decline four weeks p ost-secret in); 43 2 (slee ping thro ugh th e night w ithou t inco ntine nce when secretin administered every four weeks); 29 4 (calm er an d \"more lo veable\" po st- secretin ); and 131 (light se nsitivi ty disappe ared since starting na sal secre tin). Do ctor Bradst reet noted in Au gust, 20 06, that Colte n \"see ms to require secretin to stay on 248target - wi th it he does very well in sch ool.\" Id., p. 57. 501 (c) Chelation . Doctor McCab e testified n o good data demonstrates that che lation therapy w orks to treat autism. Snyder T r. at 677A-78A . Neverthe less, a atien ts were chela ted during his treatm ent of them, a figure tha t rem ained consiste nt over the five years prece ding the hearing. Sn yder T r. r Bradst reet testif ied that chelation was clinically indicate d in patients with a histo ry of significan t exposu re to a heavy metal; elevated current bloo d levels of mercury or lead; high levels of porphyri n in the urine , com bined with oxidativ e stre ss; high h air levels of mercury ; or a very stron g result to a provocation ch allenge. Snyder T r. at 245. He used chelation challenge to diagno se whethe r a ch ild ha d excessive lev els of mercury, and did not routinely test f or mercury or othe r hea vy metals prior to beginnin g chelatio n. Snyder T r. at 245-46. In spite of the fact that none of Colten 's tests for mercury w as high, and Colte n resp onded poorly to chela tion, Dr. Brad umerous502 chelation therapy. 503 Colten was initia lly chelated with Che met, the brand name for succim er, or DMSA, in July, 2000 . Snyder T r. at 229-30. Based on the results from this te st, Dr.504 Bradst reet prescribed 100 mg of Chem et to be taken three times a day for three d ays, followed by an 1 1 day break, repeated for 10 cycles of chelation . Apparently Dr. Kartzinal redu ced the dose by half, to 50 mg of Chem et three times a day, acco rding to nursing no tes in the records. Snyder P et. Ex. 12, p. 543. Alth ough t he date Colte n505 began takin g Chem et was no t reco rded, the prescription was dated August 3 , 2000, and a message re garding the recom mended dosage ch ange was lef t on August 4, 2000. I note that Dr. Bradstreet made virtually identical claims for IVIG's efficacy for Colten. See501 Snyder Pet. Ex. 12, p. 25 (\"One of the few things that has ever helped him is IVIG\"). In the spring of 2007, Colten scored in the 81 national percentile on reading comprehension and in the 88 for mathematics. st th Snyder Pet. Ex. 15, p. 29. His most recent IVIG treatment prior to academic testing was December 11, 2006. Snyder Pet. Ex. 12, p. 32. Colten's urinary mercury test collected on July 21, 2000 (Snyder Pet. Ex. 12, p. 544), was the502 only mercury test noted by Dr. Bradstreet to be abnormal. Snyder Tr. at 246. Doctor McCabe explained that the post-chelation mercury level found on this test was, in fact, a normal level of mercury, even in an individual not chelated. See Part C.3.b.(1)(e), supra. Doctor Bradstreet acknowledged that Colten responded poorly to chelation. Snyder Tr. at503 247A-48A. See PDR at 2458.504 Nursing notes, dated August 14, 2000, reflected that Colten took the 50 mg dosage. Snyder505 Pet. Ex. 12, p. 528. 249A nursing not e reflected that Colte n becam e very agitate d and noncompliant five days af ter ch elatio n, but that his b ehavior w as back to normal b y August 14 , 2000. On August 16, 2008, Dr. Brad street 's records re flected that Colte n was experiencing myclonic jerks at night. Snyder Pe t. Ex. 12, p. 534. Doctor B radstree t reco rded temporary setb acks with the chelation and decrea sed Colten 's dose that sam e day. Id. The secon d rou nd of chelation did not go ne arly as well. A n urse's n ote dated August 21, 2000, reflected that, upon resta rting the Chem et on August 2 0, Co lten was going \"beserck.\" He was described as a ggressiv e and noncompliant , with repetitive behaviors and tantrums. Snyder Pet . Ex. 12 , p. 528. Nevertheless, another round of chelation began in O ctober, 2000. Che met was to be compounded \"per n ew chelation protocol,\" a t a dosa ge of 200 mg, three times a day f or three d ays, f ollowed by an 1 1 day break, repeating as directe d. Snyder Pe t. Ex. 12, p. 528. This rou nd of chelation also did n ot go well. Colten visited HFHC w ith complaint s of back pa in on Octo ber 3 , 2000, the day after beginning che lation . His prima ry care provider, Dr. Von Elten, noted that 5% of children takin g Chem et develope d back o r flank p ain. Snyder P et. Ex. 7, p p. 48, 50. The Snyders called Dr. Brad street 's office on Octo ber 5 , 2000, to report tha t Colten was up all night w ith high-pitched scream ing, and that he was m ore co nstipa ted since t he last IV IG tre atment. Doct or Brad street recom mended Epson salt b aths and an enema. Snyder Pet . Ex. 12 , p. 523. The next da y, Dr. Brad street aske d to see Colten . Id. On O ctober 9, 2000, Mrs. Snyder called to report tha t, since startin g glutathio ne, Colten was vomitin g and complainin g of a backach e. Doctor B radstree t recom mended waiting until Colte n was stab le be fore rest arting che lation . Snyder Pet . Ex. 12, p. 523. Colten returned to Dr. Von Elten's of fice on Octo ber 1 2, 2000, with co ntinu ing complaint s of back pa in. A ll tests co nducted were n orma l, but Dr. Vo n Elten wrote: \"I am concerne d regarding th e treatment that he is getting f rom Dr. Bradst reet that (sic) would like to rule o ut se rious ca use for the child's back pain.\" Sn yder P et. Ex. 7, p . 47. He ord ered addition al tests, inclu ding rena l and abdominal u ltrasou nds. Id. Colte n's creatin ine, sodiu m, and carbon dioxide levels w ere lo w, but the other tests were a ll norm al. Id., pp. 43-46. Colten returned to Dr. Von Elten on Oct ober 24, 2000. Mrs. Sn yder told Dr. V on Elten that Colte n had made a drama tic imp rovement, reporting tha t \"[h]is perso nality has come back a nd he has not com plaine d of back pa in since stop ping the Chem it (sic).\" Docto r Von Elten reco mmended against re starting Che met. Snyder Pet . Ex. 7, p. 41. At Dr. B radstree t's of fice th ree d ays later, Mrs. Sn yder rep orted that it to ok a 250month to get Colten back to norm al after ch elatio n, and that he had been self-injurious, noncompliant , and aggressiv e. Snyder Pe t. Ex. 12, p. 520. Howev er, on Novem ber 10, 2000, Mrs. Snyder rep orted that Colte n \"did fine while on DMSA, when off is when regression occu rred (sic).\" Snyder Pe t. Ex. 12, p. 513. Chelat ion therapy continu ed in Feb ruary, 2005 , with a prescriptio n for DMPS, another chela ting agent. Snyder P et. Ex. 12, p. 161. He d eveloped incon tinen ce506 while u sing DMPS. Id., p. 141. In sp ite of this a dverse reactio n, another DMPS prescription was wr itten in Ju ne, 2005. Id., p. 122. This tim e, reaction s includ ed \"meltd owns,\" night sw eats, an d agitation. Id., p. 117. Doctor B radstree t's ph ysician's assistan t ordered a reduction to a half dose of DMPS. Id. Colten began getting an intraveno us form of chelation in April, 20 06, using a chela tor ca lled CaE DTA. Snyder P et. Ex. 12, pp. 89-92. He rece ived additiona l 507 treatments o f CaEDT A in May and June, 2006. Id., pp. 74, 63. The day af ter th e May chela tion, his p arents rep orted that he was easily irritated and having hea dach es and stom acha ches. Id., pp. ys after th e June chela tion, he had headache s and his a rms a nd legs hurt. Id., p. 62. In August, 2 006, after Colte n's first urinary porphyrin test, Dr. Brad street again prescribed DMPS. Snyder Pe t. Ex. 12, pp. 56-57. His mo ther reporte d that, Co lten beca me incon tinen t, paranoid o f the dark, an d easily irritated. She described him as m ore withdrawn, and said he complaine d of bone ache s, he adache, and fatigue. Id., pp. 46-47. Colte n had another CaEDT A trea tment that sam e day. Id., p. 48. This was app arently Colten 's last ch elatio n. Doctor B radstree t con cede d that Co lten did n ot respon d well to che lation . Snyder T r. at 247A-48A . The medical reco rds, inclu ding repo rts from Mrs. Snyder, reflected that Colte n did po orly after every roun d of chelation therapy, altho ugh th e effects f rom CaEDT A appeared to be milde r than those from DMSA or DMPS. The more distu rbing question is why chelatio n was perf orme d at all, in view of the normal levels of mercury fo und in th e hair, blo od, and urine, its apparent lack o f efficacy in treating Colten's symp toms, an d the adverse side effects it apparently caused. (d) Im munoglobu lin Therapy. During the course of his tre atment by Dr. Bradstree t, Colte n rece ived oral DMPS is 2,3-dimercaptopropane-1-sulfonate. MED. ABBREV. at 117.

Id., p. 583. Review ing Dr. Von Elten 's own note s, this \"agreeme nt\" wi th the proposed treatment appears to be an overstate ment. See Snyder P et. Ex. 7, p p. 52-54. At the time Colten 's IVIG treatment began, Dr. Bra dstree t con sidered IVIG therapy to b e clinically indicate d if a patien t had evidence of a dysregulated imm une system , preferably with evidence of autoantibo dies, such as anti-myelin an tibod ies or anti-endo ant ibodies. S nyder T r. at 237A-38A . Evidence of imm une dysregulation would includ e IgA d eficiencies, subcla ss IgG an d IgM de ficiencies, defects in cell-me diate d immunity, or au toimmunity. Snyder T r. at 238A. Accordin g to Doctor Bradstreet testified that oral immunoglobulin is \"essentially pooled human508 immunoglobulin\" for passive immunity. Snyder Tr. at 229. \"IVIG\" is intravenous immunoglobulin. MED. ABBREV. at 195. The administration of IVIG,509 according to Dr. Bradstreet's records, was a time-consuming and labor-intensive process. To illustrate, Colten's 6 IVIG treatment, administered on August 16, 2000, began at 8:30 AM, with application of ath topical anesthetic. The IV was established at 9:30 AM, and infusion of Gamimune began at 9:50 AM, followed by SoluMedrol (a steroid), Benadryl (an antihistamine), and Nubain (an opiate pain medication prescribed as a sedative). See http://www.fda.gov/medwatch/safety/2003/03apr_pi./nubain_pi.pdf) (;ast visited on February 5, 2009). More Gamimune was administered at 12:30 PM. A nurse noted Colten's condition every 15 minutes, until 3:30 PM, when the IV was discontinued. Snyder Pet. Ex. 12, MBP , a positive rheumatoid factor, IgA de ficiency, and very high levels of IgE. S nyder T r. at 238A-39A . The anti-MBP titer, in the prese nce of Colten 's history and sympto ms, was of the greatest co ncern to Dr. Bradst reet in the decision to begin IVI G therapy. His trea tment objective was to im prove the child's b ehavior to the point of recovery or near reco very. Thus, although la boratory v alues would be monito red, treatment efficacy w ould be measure d by 's beh avior-in Dr. on patient\"- rathe r than strictly on lab orato ry values. Snyder T r. at 239A. Doctor510 Bradst reet was also con cerne d about n's on going g astroin testin al pro blem s, his immunological history, and his regressiv e history . He believed t hat Colten had an autoimmune-relat ed ence phalopathy, a co nditio n that would b enefit from IVIG. Snyder Tr. at 190. Respo ndent's e xperts were h ighly skep tical of Dr. Brad street 's treat ment ration ale a nd its ef ficacy. Doctor Zweiman testified that the available st udies on IVIG therapy f or AS D had such significa nt design f laws tha t it was imp ossible to extrapo late an effect o n ASD's core f eatures. He co mmented that both a group o f Cana dian experts an d the American Aca demy of Pediatrics h ave f ound insu fficient d ata to supp ort the use of IVIG in t reatin g autism . Snyder T r. at 615A, 678A. In his rep ort, Dr. Zimm erma n also no ted that there was no evidence that administration of immunoglobulins im proved a utistic sympt oms. Ced illo Res. E x. FF at 2. Doctor W ard testified that IVIG is no t a treatment co mmonly used for wild-ty pe measles virus inf ection s and, thus, it was unlikely to be effective in trea ting a511 persiste nt measle s infection of any type. S nyder T r. at 943A-45A . Since Co lten was alread y manufacturing Ig G against the measle s virus at the time his IVIG treatments began (Snyder Pe t. Ex. 207, p. 1), the measle s antibod ies in t he IVIG treatments (Snyder T r. at 944A) would not do anything his im mune system was not already doin g. Both an immunologist and a pediatric neu rologist w ho evaluate d Colte n in 2005- 06 were a trea tments. Doct or Sko da-Sm ith, a n immunologist w ho evaluate d Colte n in Novembe r, 2005, com mented: \"I do not know of an immunologist that uses titers o f [anti-MBP] an tibod ies to guide I VIG therapy at th is time.\" Sh e noted that Co lten's f amily attribute d his dram atic reco very to the IVIG As late as November, 2005, Mrs. Snyder apparently believed that the IVIG treatments were510 determined, at least in part, on test results for anti-MBP antibodies. See Snyder Pet. Ex. 33, p. 15 (Mrs. Snyder stating to Dr. Skoda-Smith that Dr. Bradstreet used MBP titers as a guide to determine when Colten needed another dose of IVIG). IVIG is used to treat MIBE in rare cases to protect the patient against the disease until immune511 function is restored or improved. Even then, most of those with MIBE will die unless the underlying and unrelated immunosuppression can be reversed. Snyder Tr. at 945A-46. It is also used on rare occasions with infants whose mothers contract measles in the last few days of pregnancy or shortly after birth. Maternal antibodies against measles commonly protect newborns, but a mother with a recent infection would not have antibodies to pass on to her child. Snyder Tr. at 943A-44A. 253therapy and com mented: \"There are children with poorly described inflammatory disea ses o f the central ne rvous system that have resp onded to IVIG therapy. How ever, most of these ch ildren h ave som e signif icant marker, f inding, o r derlyi ng inf lammation.\" Snyder Pe t. Ex. 33, p. 19. She did n ot note any such signif icant marker in Colte n. She stated: \"I think it would b e importa nt for us to find so me clear m arker th at IVIG is ben efitting this young m an. It is difficult to know w ithou t struct ured or validate d behavioral scale s, whethe r we can use behavioral measure s alon e to guide o ur therapy in his case. \" Id., p. 20. The pediatric ne urologist who examine d Colte n in Janu ary, 2006 (the only time Colten actu ally saw a pe diatric neurologist), com mented: \"At this t ime, we have no explana tion why these sympto ms shou ld be respo IV IG. ehavioral distu rbances a re cycl ical.\" Id., p. 2. The examine r recom mended a referral to a developm ental diso rders, b ut the family declined. Id. The opinions o f both sp ecialists were b ased on the repo rts of Colten 's family concerning on set, cyclic natu re of the symptoms, an d efficacy of the IVIG trea tments. Mrs. Snyder test ified that prior to Colten 's third b irthda y, there were brief periods when they saw \"the o ld Colte n.\" S nyder T r. th erapy began, Colten 's perso nality \"started\" t o return. His langua ge imp roved, with parts o f words512 instea d of just so unds. Snyder T r. at 65-66. His facial e xpression s retu rned. Althou gh he still engaged in repe titive play, he b egan re spon ding to his na me and interactin g with his family. The more he received IV IG, \"th e more h e came back to us.\" S nyder T r. at 67. By the time he was in pre -kindergarten , he was doing w ell. Mrs. Sn yder delibe rately chose not to tell h is pre-kinde rgarten teacher a bout his A SD dia gnosis, an d received good repo rts from her. Snyder T r. at 67-68. Mrs. Noona n also te stified that after th e IVIG th erapy began, Colte n played be tter in groups a nd was m ore a part of the family. His spe ech slowly returned. He intera cted with her an d began t o participat e in story time. Snyder T r. at 97-98. In the medical reco rds, Mrs. Sn yder gen erally noted improvements after IV IG therapy ( see, e.g., Snyder P et. Ex. 12, pp. 440, 369), altho ugh th ere were tim es when the therapy itself (or som e component thereof) cause d Colte n to be ill or to miss sch ool afterwards. See, e.g., id., pp. 265, 246, 223, 219, 103. However, she also re corde d improvements at the office visi ts on the date of the IVIG therapy, presumably w hen Colten 's symptoms would have been at their worst. See, e.g., id., pp. 461, 452, 432. She noted when gaps in the IVIG therapy caused problem behavior. See, e.g., id., p. 406 (abo ut 6 weeks since p revious I VIG treatment); p . 335 (Dr. Jekyl and Mr. Hy de at about 16 weeks since the previous IV IG tre atment); p. 311 (six weeks since p revious Her statements in the medical records reflected Colten's improvement in September, 1999512 (Snyder Pet.

Doctor B radstree t cou ld no t explain why IVIG effective in trea ting Colten , alth ough h e had theories. Snyder T r. at 239A. He te stified that IVIG was \"an anti-inflammatory,\" and t hat it was used in LKS, a conditio n he described as sim ilar to autism. Snyder T r. at 240A. He was aware tha t most b atches of IVIG con taine d anti- measles b ut the titers o f antibod ies in t he IVIG he administered were not importan t to him, as long as t he treatment was ef fective. It was effective in Colte n's case, and in the case s of many peo ple with ASD, base d on his em pirical evidence . Snyder T r. at 240A-42. Acco rding to Dr. B radstree t, Colte n did rem arkab ly well on the treatment, going fro m severe de lay to be coming an A /B student, with excellent language, and a ch armin g and social p erson ality. Snyder T r. at 190. In the 2002 tim e frame , Med icaid withdrew approval f or IVI G trea tment, so Colten received it le ss frequent ly over tha t period. Both Dr. Bra dstree t and Mrs. Sn yder reported that if he went longer th an 30 days bet ween IVIG trea tments, Colte n becam e more irritable, squinted or close d his eyes during con versatio ns, d isplayed m ore obse ssive behavior, an d was less socia lly interactiv e. Snyder T r. at 190-91A. Beca use Colten regressed when he didn't get IV IG tre atments, Dr. Brad street conclu ded that he had immunological dy sregulation that was auto immune in nature. Snyder T r. at 192. He did n ot reference any tests o bjectively measu ring auto immunity in Colte n. During the period from April 29 , 2005, to May 19, 2006, the pace of IVIG treatments su bstantially slow ed. Colte n had an IVIG treatment on April 29, 2 005, a subcu taneous IG t reatm ent on September 15 , 2005, a su bcutaneous IVIG treatment on Octob er 4, 2005, and an IVIG tre atment on May 19, 2 006.

In spite of the length of time between t he last two treatments, Dr. Bradst reet describe d Colte n as having don e \"am azing ly well.\" Id., p. 74. During this sam e tim e frame , Colte n had excellent grade s (Snyder Pe t. Ex. 7, pp. 10- 12), was described as co mmunica ting w ell by both Dr. Evers ( id.) and Dr. Sko da-Sm ith (Snyder Pet .

However, there is a reference by Mrs. Snyder on October 27, 2005, that Colten's last IVIG was administered on October 4, 2005. Snyder Pet. Ex. 12, p. 97. I conclude that the IVIG treatment was actually administered, possibly at home, subcutaneously. See Snyder Pet. Ex. 7, p. 22. 255Pet.

T hose sympto ms, plus the crying and sleep disord er, were all pa rt of his e ncep halopathic sympto ms. Snyder T r. at 220A-21A . He testif ied that there was no way to distinguish b etween t hese manifestations of ASD a nd the langua ge regression he later develope d. Snyder T r. at 221A. Doctor B radstree t did not explain why these sympto ms marked t he beginnin g of his e ncep halopathy, but the earlier and similar sympto ms did n ot. Base d on Mrs. Sn yder's rep orts and his interp retation o f Colten 's me dical515 Doctor Bradstreet believed that vaccines caused between 10-50% of the cases of autism he514 has treated. Snyder Tr. at 219A-19B. Although Dr. Bradstreet characterized Mrs. Snyder as an excellent historian regarding Colten's515 condition (Snyder Tr. at 173A-74), she was reporting events to him that had transpired over a year earlier. I have detailed above my reasons for accepting the contemporaneous medical records as accurate and will not repeat them here. To the extent Dr. Bradstreet's opinions are based on Mrs. Snyder's accounts, they are not reliable. As the Court of Federal Claims has noted, a doctor's \"conclusions...are only as good as the reasons and evidence that support them.\" Davis v. Sec'y, HHS, 20 Cl. Ct. 168, 173 See also Perreira, 33 F.3d at 1377 n.6 (\"An expert opinion is no better than the soundness of the reasons 256records, Dr. Bradst reet opined that Colte n's visi t to Dr. Sah ai on May 6, 19 98, was \"th e first evi dence of a low-grade enceph alitis con dition .\" Sn yder P et.

In essence , Dr. Brad street prese nted a theory based on direct a nd circumsta ntial evidence. The direct e vidence was the prese nce of measle s virus in Co lten's CS F and gut, as detected by Unigenet ics. T he circumsta ntial e vidence was the improvement Colten made based on treatments d esigned to co unter a persiste nt measle s virus infection .

He also f ailed to explain the relation ship, if any, between MBP a ntibo dies a nd measles virus.

Resp ondent also raised question s con cerning Dr. Brad street 's biase s and motives f B radstree t identified Co lten as one of the three children he described in the article (Bradstre et 2004) that he co-au thored with Dr. Wakefield, f iled a s Snyder P et.

T heir o pinion s are base d on Colte n's m edica l records and have the weig ht of scient ific aut Doctor K insbo urne's Opinio n. Unlike Dr. Brad street , Dr. Kinsb ourne did no t rely on th e theory of mercury dysregulation of Colten 's imm une system, beca use, for him , it was unn ecessa ry. Base d on the presen ce of the virus in Co lten's system , he opined that Colte n's im mune system was obviously unable to clear it. Therefore, Dr. Kinsbo urne could con clude that the persistent measles virus cause d Colte n's AS D withou t determining w hat allowed or cause d the virus to persist. Mercury could b e one of those factors, bu t Colte n's ina bility to mount an appropriate im mune respo nse to the MMR v accine did not depend on any impact o f mercury on his im mune system . Doct or causa tion in Colte n's case did not depend on any fo rm of imm une dysreg ulatio n predating Colte n's vaccination . Snyder T at 486A-87 A. In essence , Dr. Kinsb ourne contended that the prese nce of measle s virus in Doctor Ward also noted that Colten had a very similar white blood cell count during another518 bacterial infection in March,1999.

If Colten had a neurotrop ic virus in h is CSF an d a neurological illness, then the logical conn ection required b y Althe n was m ade, and, presum ably, the temporal one as well.

Doct or Kinsb ourne unequivocally stated that, without the finding of measle s vaccine vir us m aterial in Colte n's system, he would not be able to opine in favor of vaccine cau sation in Colte n's case . Snyder T r. at 491A. In view of that statement, I defer my conclusion on Dr. Kinsbo urne's opin ion u ntil af ter a discussion of the evidence for measle s viral ma terial in Colten 's CSF. 3. Doctor K ennedy. Doctor K ennedy of fered opinions on measles vaccine causa tion in this case, as well as o pinion s on other topics up on which h e was not qualif ied to opine, based on his education , train ing, and experience . To the extent that Dr. K ennedy of fered opinions beyond the scop e of his e xpertise , his t estim ony is not reliable 1268 (Fed. Cir. 2 008); Nimely v.

E. Factu al Find ings. 1. Autistic Regression. Altho ugh th e evidence co ncern ing Colten's la nguage skills prior to and after his MMR v accina tion is in con flict, con temporaneous m edica l records su pport tha t Colte n's language d evelopm ent arreste d, and may have declined , during the t wo to four m onths after his vaccina tion. Colte n had between 10-20 words a t the tim e his expressiv e lan guage skills began to regress in the late spring or summer of 1998, although t hese repo rts w ere a ll ma de on or after March, 1999. The video records suggest tha t Colte n's lan guage skills at 1 3 months were no t well- According to Dr. Kinsbourne, the pharyngitis and recurrent fevers Colten suffered after the519 MMR vaccine were evidence of the immune suppression caused by the vaccine. Snyder Tr. at 494A, 497A. A more extensive explanation of Dr. Kinsbourne's theories was set forth and discussed in520 Section VI.A.2.b.(1) above. Therefore, I have not repeated that explanation here. 260develope d and Dr. Otgebe ye's reco rds do cument that Colte n's vocabu lary was underdeveloped when he was 17 months old. T he use of just t hree words a t that age was clea rly abnorm al, but the record d oes not suggest tha t he had lost langua ge prior to this visi t. At the time of his MMR v accina tion in Ap ril, 199 8, when Colten was 15 months old, Dr. Sah ai no ted that there was no evidence of a receptive lan guage disord er. He did n ot co mment on Colten 's expressiv e lan guage ab ilities. I ca nnot inte rpret h is lack of comment as reflecting eith er no rmal o r abn orma l lan guage. During th e hosp italization , which too k place over a m onth after th e vaccinatio n, there were n o conce rns ab out Colten 's language a bilities expressed , eith er by his pa rents or by his caregiv ers. T he developm ental histo ry indica ted that he understo od English, was able to express h imse lf, and had an age-app ropriate prese su ggested Colte n's lan guage skills w ere b elow norm al was that of Dr. Ote gbeye, w hich in dicate d that Co lten had only three words on June 10, 1998, when Colten was 17 months old. Colten 's pare nts gave vari ous dates for the arrest or d ecline of Colten 's expressiv e lan guage. In March, 1 999, Mr. Sn yder p rovided a history of langua ge loss at 12 months. Mrs. Snyder provided a variety of ages f or when the langua ge loss occurred : 15 months and 17 months to Dr. W enk; 18 months to Dr. Brad street ; and 19 months at Colten 's two year che ckup, when she expressed concern a bout his developm ent. 521 Altho ugh th e issue is far from clear, giv en the range o f 12-19 m onths in parental reports, I a dopt the most co ntemporaneous acco unt of Colten 's language p roblem s, and find that Colten 's spee ch problem s were first app arent when h e was bet ween 17 and 19 months old, or between June and August, 1998. In the followi ng mo nths, his expressiv e ued or declined . Othe r autistic-li ke behaviors mo st likely man ifested in the two to th ree m onths prece ding his two year checku p. In mid-Nov ember, 1998, Dr. S ahai describe d Colte n as active, playful, running aroun d, and spitting ou t a few w ords. About two and one-half months late r, Mrs. Snyder repo rted behavioral conce rns an d Dr. Sa hai n oted some of his own, com menting th at Co lten's b ehavior w as l.\" It is rtainly behavioral conce rns ea rlier than mid-Nov ember, 1998, but if they did, they were n ot su fficiently sev ere to bring to th e attention of Dr. Sah ai or h is physician's assista nt. If they existed in June or Ju ly, 1998, it is surp rising that the It is noteworthy that Mrs. Snyder's first recorded account of Colten's language problems did521 not directly state that he had loss of words. Doctor Sahai recorded Mrs. Snyder as saying \"he was speaking relatively well and right around 19 months seemed to just arrest the process.\" However, the statement \"he is no longer speaking well\" does suggest some diminution of language or articulation. Snyder Pet. Ex. 8, p. 66. 261Snyders did not follow up wi th Dr. O tegbeye, a s the y were u rged to do. In view of Mrs. Snyder's praise of Dr. Sah ai on the initial quest ionnaire th at sh e completed for Dr. Bradst reet, I expressly reject he r testim ony tha t she mentioned Colte n's be havior to Dr. Sahai ea rlier and that he was not respon sive to her conce rns. I n this regard, I n ote that Dr. Bradst reet was quite critical of Dr. Sah ai's care of Colten , and his negative522 opinions m have Snyder's later ccoun ts. 2. Immune a fter his MMR v accina tion were o f the sam e type a s tho se th at prece ded it. T he weight loss t hat prom pted, at least in p art, Dr. S ahai's ref erral of Colten to Dr. Otegbe ye began b etween A pril 7, 1 998, and his MMR v accina tion. Colten 's symptoms and illnesse s in th e 33 days between h is vaccina tion and his hosp italization were n ot co t with a measle s virus inf ection . The evidence that Colte Dr. Bra dstree t, attribut ed any clinical significa nce to the IgA test results obtained by Dr. Ote gbeye. Docto r Bradst reet is the only physician who at tached any significan ce to the sedimentation rate or po sitive RF test results. At best, Dr. Sa hai sa w the RF test as a reaso n for an other visit to Dr. Otegbe ye, a suggestion Co lten's p arents did not take. Their f ailure t o return to Dr. Otegbe ye also suggests th at they did n ot believe Colten 's cond ition was seriou s. Doctor B radstree t's test ing showed two results o f concern: Colten 's extremely high IgG level in July, 199 9, and his an ti-MBP level in Jan uary, 200 0. Doctor Zweiman agreed that both of these te st resu lts were h ighly unusua l. Howev er, Dr. Brad street apparently did not think the IgE level w as su fficiently concern ing to f ollow up on it; after noting the result, the next time he mentioned it was w hen he used it a s partial justification for trea ting Colten with IV IG, se ven months late r. In view of Colten 's numerous food and environmental allergies, th e IgE t est re sults likely ref lected an overproduct ion o f IgE in resp onse to these stim uli. T here was no evidence th at a high IgE level is in an y way conne cted with a post-me asles vaccine supp ressed imm une system ; indeed, levels tha t high ref lect a n over-activated im mune respo nse. The anti-MBP level in 200 0 was abe rrant in view of the later testin g. As Dr. Zweiman testif g is used prima rily for resea rch, n ot diagnostic p urposes; a nd there is no conn ection between anti-MBP levels and measle s virus inf The IVIG treatment ca nnot be respo nsible for the decline from the initial very high level of anti- MBP, a s Colten 's ant i-MBP level w as norma l at the time of his f irst IVIG treatment. His levels remain ed norm al or o nly sli ghtly elevated throughou t the rem ainder of his treatment by Dr. Brad street . See generally, Snyder Pet. Ex. 1. But see Snyder Res. Ex. K at 4-6 (Dr. Ward's assessment522 of Dr. levels rema ined elevated throughou t much of his treatment by Dr. Brad street , nothing in Dr. B radstree t's records or testimo ny indicate d that Colte n's trea tment or diagnosis was predica ted on the leuko cytosis. 3. Mercury Efflux Di sorde r. There is no evidence that Colte n suffered from a mercury ef flux disorder. T he evidence overw helm ingly esta blish th at Co lten's m ercury lev el was norm al at the time it was first me asure d, and at an appropriate and expected level, in vi ew of his T CV exposure and dietary histo ry. He respo by ex creting me rcury in an amount Dr. Brad street considered abnorm al ba sed on pre-che lation norms. I accep t Dr. McCabe 's testim ony tha t this level w as not abnormal p ost-che lation . In view of Colten 's norm al mercury lev els on all sub sequen t tests com monly accepte d to measure mercury ( hair, b lood, and urine), an d the conflicts bet ween Dr. Nata f's interp retations o f Colten porphyri n testing resea rch cond ucted by Dr. W ood, plus Dr. McCabe's t estim ony tha t the rela tionsh ip be tween urinary porph yrins an d mercury body burde n is \"a work in p rogress,\" I f ind that the porphyrin test resu lts for Colte n are e any 4. Ent eroco Petitione rs have no t demonstrat ed en teroco litis\" is the rele vant medica l com munity. Even if it were, the evidence that Colte n fit the \"autistic ent eroco litis phe notype\" is weak. It is clea r from the records that Colte n had numerous, and genera lly mild, digestive sy stem prob lems from early inf ancy onward. T he medical reco rds do not demonstrat e that Co lten suffered from chron ic diarrhea between his MMR v accina tion and his two year w ell-child vi sit, wi th only one mention of \"loose stoo ls\" beginning on the day of that visit. After two y ears o f age, Co lten had only four o r five bouts of diarrhe a last ing more than a day or tw o that were un accom panied b y clear e vidence of illness. Mrs. Snyder de scribed three weeks of loose stoo ls in May, 199 9, in the question naire she complete d for Dr. Brad street . Thereafter, the parent evaluation shee ts, co mpleted prior to most o f Colten 's examina tions by Dr . Brad street , provide a n excellent record of the cond ition o f his b owels. Colten had diarrhea in late Octo ber-ea rly Novemb er, 1999, with no evidence of illness, b ut it began after he finished takin g Difluca n, prescribed to treat a yeast overg rowth in his d igestiv e tract. He was back to normal b y early Decem ber, 1999. Snyder Pe t. Ex. 12, pp. 595, 600-01. He ha d another b out of diarrhe a in mid-Janu ary to early February, 2000 . Id., p. 591. In Ma rch, 2 002, he had diarrhea again, b ut it was in con junctio n with a f ebrile illne ss. Id., p. 432. In Ma y, 2002, Colten began an other bout of diarrhe a, accom panied b y lethargy, resu lting in his ref erral to Dr. Th ek. The illness con tinue d into June, 2002. Id., pp. 389, 395, and 406. In February, 2003, Mrs. 263Snyder de scribed a few episode s of diarrhe a. In Ma rch, 2 003, he had one week of diarrhea . Id., pp. 335, 304. He h ad problems again in July, 200 4, which Mrs. Sn yder attribu ted to some dietary supp lements. Id., p. 194. Altho ugh Dr. T hek's h istory described interm ittent, chronic d iarrhea, it do es not appear from Colten 's me dical reco rds th at the problem was very frequent or se vere except d uring the period May-June, 2002, when his en dosco py and colon oscop y were performe d. The descript ions o f Colten 's bowel hab its do not sup port the descriptions of the children with th e purported \"autistic e nterocolitis\" phe notype. Colte n's m any ood and environm ental allergies, co upled with occasio nal erial gastrointe stinal infection s, ap pear to b e a more likely ex planation for his sympt oms. Con trary to Dr. Bradst reet's reco rds, th ere is n o evidence th at Co lten had inflammatory bow el dise ase or en teroco litis. Docto r Thek did no t diagnose h im with en teroco litis or colitis; f rom the evidence, Dr. Ant hony does not appear to be a physici an, and thus co uld n ot make such a diagnosis. 5. Measles Infection . a. Initial \"Va ccine Re action .\" Mrs. Snyder att ribute d Colte n's sympto ms between his MMR v accina tion on April 23, 1998, and his May 26, 1998 hosp italization , to a reaction to the MMR v tion. Doctor K insbo urne attribute d the illnesse s he had, sp anning the two or three month period after his vaccina tion, to the MMR v accine . Snyder T r. at 459A-60A . However, Colten 's symptoms were n ot co nsisten t with su ch a react ion o r with a measles viral inf ection . The small white patchy th roat were u nlikely to523 be Koplik's spots, not only because the vaccine vir us does not prod uce Koplik's spots, but also beca use they were d escribed in th e same term s Dr. Sah ai ap plied to their p re- vaccina tion manifestation. Snyder T r. at 970A-74. Measles infection s do not gene rally involv e sore throats or ph aryngitis. Sn yder Tr. at 972-74. Likewise, Colten 's sympto ms, between his MMR v accina tion in April an d his hosp italization in May, w ere n ot co nsisten t with measle s infection , measle s Doctor Skoda-Smith wrote about the striking timing between Colten's MMR vaccination and523 the onset of certain symptoms, commenting that they appeared to be related to a post-MMR reaction. Snyder Pet. Ex. 33, p. 18. However, her comment was based on an incorrect history of the timing and nature of the subsequent symptoms. She did not have access to most of Colten's records, particularly those between April, 1998 - January, 2000. Therefore, I attach no weight to these comments. When an expert's opinion is based upon facts not established by the record, a fact-finder may reject the expert's opinion. Bradley, 991 F.2d at 1574. 264ence phalitis (ADEM any othe r cond ition kn own to b e associate d524 with m easle s virus. S nyder T r. at 971A-74.

Beca use there is no credib le evidence that measle s vaccine vir us incre ases the likelihood of other childh ood illnesses within 4 5-60 days of vaccination , I ca nnot attribu te either t he illness th at led to his h ospita lization or his June , 1999 illness to the MMR v accina tion. These factual findings seriou sly undercu t Dr. Kinsb ourne's op inions regarding the temporal relation ship b etween vaccinat ion a nd onse t of ASD symp toms in Colte n's case. Neverthele ss, be cause the postulat ed mechan ism o f injury is a pe rsistent525 measles virus, it is ne cessary to co nside r the evidence regarding me asles virus persiste nce in Colte n. b. nd the hearing w as entirely inconsiste nt with what is kn own and genera lly acce pted about measle ection on, genera l, Unigenet ics' reports sh owing the prese nce of measle s virus F gene RNA in ch ildren with ASD, and in Colte n's spe cific case, the Unigenet ics' reports o f measle s virus F gene RNA in Co lten's gut tissue and CSF. W ithou t these results f rom Unigenetics, Dr. Kinsbo urne was unwilling to op ine in favor of vaccine cau sation of Colten 's cond ition. la S nyder Pet . Ex. 12 , pp. 390 and 419, reflected positive resu lts for measle s virus RNA in Co lten's t ermin al ilium (id., p. 380) a nd CSF ( id., p. 419). If reliable , the rep ort of measle s virus RNA in Co lten's CSF w ould be stron gly prob ative tha t there was an ongoing persisten t measle s infection in Colte n's bra in. If reliable , the rep ort of measle s virus RNA in Co lten's gut would be probative of the \"autistic ent eroco litis\" disease proce ss osed W akefield, a nd the gut-brain co nnection would provide th linka ge bet ween measle s virus pe rsisting in In his expert reports, Dr. Bradstreet opined that Colten suffered a post-vaccinal524 encephalopathy. See, e. g., Snyder Pet. Ex. 1, p. 7. In PIEM occurring after measles infection, no measles virus has been found in the brain. Snyder Tr. at 836A. Doctor Ward offered convincing evidence that Colten did not have a post-vaccinal encephalopathy. Snyder Tr. at 971-74; Snyder Res. Ex. K at 11- 12. Doctor Wiznitzer came to a similar conclusion. Snyder Res. Ex. A at 3-4 (pages unnumbered in filed exhibit). I note that Dr. Kinsbourne did not offer testimony in support of Dr. Bradstreet's opinion. It appears that Dr. Kinsbourne placed more reliance on Mrs. Snyder's testimony than on the525 contemporaneous medical records. For the reasons noted above, I found the contemporaneous records to be more reliable. See Bradley, 991 F.2d at 1574. 265the gut an d neurologic dy sfunctions m anifesting as autism. The Unigenetics la boratory report appearing at Sn yder P et. Ex. 12, p. 417, reflected that Unigene tics w as unable to detect m easle s virus in Co lten's p eriphe ral bloo d. (1) Irreconcilab le Con flicts in Unigene tics' T est Re sults. Even if all th ree test re sults a re acce pted as prob ative and reliable evidence , there is a serious conflict am ong th em. There is no biolo gically plau sible e to test n egative, the gut bio psy to te st po sitive at a very low copy number (or, as Dr. Ke nnedy called it, \"indet ermin ate\"(Sny der T r. at 380A)), and his526 CSF to test positive f or a very high level of the virus. Doctor Rim a explaine d that becau se m easle s is an entirely cell-associa ted virus, the F gene repo rted as presen t in Co lten's CS F mu st ha ve come from cells in th e CSF. Snyder T r. at 881A. Doctor W ard co ncurred , noting tha t measle s virus ha s not been isolate d from plasm a, only from cells. T he only cells in th e CSF a re lymphoid (white blood) cells, t he same white blo od cells circulating in t he blood. Snyder T r. at 950-51A. Assum ing a lon g-term, persistent measles in fection measle s-infected cells in the CSF are in consiste nt with the PBMCs h aving no detectib le vir us. Snyder T r. at 881A-82A . If there were h igh lev els of infection in th e white blo od cells of the brain , it is logically incon sistent that the virus would b e absen t from the white blood cells in the peripheral circulatory sy stem . Snyder T r. at 950-51A. (2) Unigenetics' Resu lts are Unreliable as E vidence. I con clude that none of the Unigenet ics' test re sults in Colten 's case are sufficiently reliable to be considered as p robative evidence becau se of the myriad f laws in Unigene tics' testin g. I ba se th is conclu sion o n the gene ral cau sation evidence alread y discusse d with regard to Unigenetics, and on evidence specific to Co lten's case. Even without considering an y of the evidence derived from the U.K. litigation , I neverthe less con clude that the resu lts from these te sts are not reliab le evidence that Colten had a measle s virus is pe rsisting in the central ne rvous system of an individual, t here Doctor Kennedy's testimony regarding the gut biopsy's RNA results was highly equivocal. He526 testified that the gut biopsy \"might be a low positive.\" Snyder Tr. at 380A. Later, he stated that the only site of measles virus that he was concerned about in Colten was his CSF. Snyder Tr. at 382A. Based on his tone and demeanor at the time he offered this testimony, I interpret \"concerned about\" to mean that this was the test result upon which Dr. Kennedy was relying for his opinions. Testimony by Dr. Rima disclosed that the reported result for the gut biopsy was not a standard quantification report, even for Unigenetics. The report used the \">\" sign before the amount. Read literally, this report indicated that there was measles virus F gene present in some amount greater than 7 copies per nanogram of total RNA. Snyder Tr. at 891A. 266shou ld be evidence of an enhanced immune respo nse against t hat virus. S nyder T r. at 593A; Ce dillo Res. Ex. R at 7 . Colte n had appropriate evidence of measle s virus antibodies in h is serum nearly two y ears a fter th e vaccinatio n (Sn yder P et. Ex. 207 , p. 1). Ne arly four years af ter administration of the MMR v accine , in a sam ple d rawn at the same tim e as the CSF sam ple that Unigenet ics teste d for the measle s virus RNA, th ere was no evidence of measle s virus. T his is inco nsisten t with an active viral inf ection . There was no evidence of MMR antibo dies in his CSF, also in consiste nt with an active viral inf ection , particularly since Colten demonstrat ed a previous re spon se to the vaccine in his positive m easle s IgG titer. Snyder T r. at 593, Snyder P et. Ex. 207 , p.527 2; Snyder Pet . Ex. 12 , p. 419. Measles virus, like o ther RNA v iruses, m ust re plicate constantly in order to survive. Snyder T r. at 837A-38A . If no antibod ies are prese nt to fight the virus, it ca n replicate virtually unche cked. Thus, if measle s virus w ere a ctually prese nt in Colten 's brain, but he was not manufacturing any antibo dies a gainst it, t he results would b e incom patible with Colten 's cont inued life or hea lth. Since Colten had serum antibodies to measle s virus at an earlier point, he was ca pable of mounting an immune respo nse. If he had measle s virus prese nt in his b rain, a ntibo dies t o the virus would b e presen t. In SSPE, when m easle s virus pe rsists in th e brain, m easle s antibod y levels are extremely high.

Sn yder Pet. Ex. 12 , p. 315. (b) Am ount of RNA Dete cted Is Im plausible. 529 Another highly com pelling reaso n to doubt the validity of the Unigenet ics test results f or measle s RNA in Co lten's CS F is the extreme ly high cop y numbers of the virus pu rported ly found. Doctor Rim a echoe d the testimo ny of Dr. Grif fin in t he Cedillo In other words, Colten's adaptive immune system had previously fought the virus and527 produced memory cells (as indicated by the positive IgG titer) capable of recognizing the virus again. The same is not true in MIBE. See Bitnum, Cedillo Pet. Ex. 61, Tab K. However, MIBE occurs528 only in individuals who were immunosuppressed at the time the virus is contracted or the vaccine was administered. With the possible exception of Dr. Kennedy, all of petitioners' expert witnesses were in agreement that Colten's immune system was functioning when his MMR vaccine was administered. In interpreting the transcript references to copy numbers, I note that, for reasons unknown,529 even the corrected transcript in this case perpetuated the error in the earlier version, in that figures referring to exponents are not typed with superscript. For example, in the first paragraph appearing in the Snyder transcript at p. 887A, the figure 104 should have been typed as 10; the figure 103 should have4 been 10; and the figure 107 should have been 10. 3 7 267trial ab out the significa nce of extreme ly high cop y numbers, saying that t hey w ere n ot530 biologically plau sible. Cedillo T r. at 2783-84; Snyder T r. at 930A-31A . By w ay of background, Dr. Rim a explaine d that a cell no rmally has a bout 200,000 copies o f mRNA. If he attempted to grow his b est-grow ing strain o f measle s531 virus in Ve ro cells, at best, he could get 3 ,000 copies o f the measle s F gene mRNA532 per ce ll. An infected cell would also have 20 ,000 copies o f the measle s N gene mRNA, plus so me amount of mRNA f rom the other measle s genes prese nt. Based on the level of virus repo rted in Colte n's cells, e very cell pre sent in his CSF w ould have to be stuffed with m easle s virus. S nyder T r. at 882A-83A . That would leave no room for the cells' own mRNA. Snyder T r. at 883A-84A . There would be no need to use PCR testing to detect the virus be cause it cou ld ea sily be isolate d from the cells or p icked u p by immunocytochemistry. Snyder T r. at 884A. In Co lten's ca se, the figure reporte d for his CSF was positive at 3 .7 x 10 per4 nanogram o f RNA. This m eant that Co lten had 3,400 copie s of the measle s virus F533 gene p er cell in his CSF, a result too high to be credib le. S nyder T r. at 929-32A. (c) Th e Lack o f Backup Data for the Hea dline Repo rt. Most lab orato ry repo rts in Va ccine A ct case s are accep ted at face value, altho ugh th ere is n o sta tutory requireme nt that special m asters do so. See \u00a7 300aa- 13(b)(1) (\" test result\" am ong th e medica l evidence not bind ing on a special m aster). If a report reflects th e presen ce of a pathogen, the special m aster com monly accepts that report as so lid evidence that the pathogen is p resen t.

Cedillo Tr. at5 1960-62. He noted that the manufacturer of the TaqMan kits used a standard figure of about 200,000531 copies of mRNA molecules per cell. About 1,000 of those 200,000 copies are GAPDH. Snyder Tr. at 874-75A. Vero cells have no innate immunity, and thus do not impede viral growth by immune attack. 532 Snyder Tr. at 932A. Doctor Rima explained that sometimes Unigenetics reported the number of copies of RNA533 found, and sometimes reported the number of copies per nanogram of RNA. In the latter case, an additional computation was made. Snyder Tr. at 850A. The 3.7 x 10 figure reported for Colten is the4 equivalent of 37,000 copies of measles F gene per nanogram of RNA. 268cond ucted activity. Howev er, Unigene tics existed f or on e purpose-to test pa tient534 samples f or use in litigation. Test re sults f rom hosp ital or in dependent labo ratories a re gene rally repo rted in a \"headline\" f orm, and are acce pted in that form. That is, th e lab orato ry repo rt reflects the test performe d and the results therefrom, com pared to esta blished normal values, withou t reference to any underlyi ng dat a concern ing the manner in w hich t he testin g was performe d. Doctor Rim a raise d concern s about Unigenet ics \"hea dline\" rep ort for measle s virus in Colte n's case based on the specific am ount reported for Colte n being biologically implausible , and upon other pu blicly repo rted data in the Uhlm ann and Bradst reet 2004 papers. He e xplaine d that the CSF results reported by Unig enetics for the three children in Dr. Brad street 's 200 4 paper were a ll scientif ically implausible beca use the amounts of F gene repo rted were sim ply too h igh to b e believed. Co lten, Child 3, in Dr. Bra dstree t's stud y (Snyder T r. at 255), had the lowest of the three amounts rep orted ; the measle s RNA results for the other two children e xceed ed the amount of total RNA p resen t in ce lls. Sn yder T r. at 882A-84A , 890A-94 A, 931A. A test that produce s imp ossible results sh ould not be relied upon, and certain ly should n ot be accep ted at face value. Even if test results are, in the norma l course of business, presu med to be valid, Dr. Rima's te stimo ny shif ted the burden of esta blishing the validity of Unigenet ics' results b ack to petitione rs. T hey f ailed to co nvince m e that Unigenetics' te st resu lts were reliab le. (3) Matte rs Deriv ed from the U.K. Litigation. (a) Copy Numb er Discrepan cies. In the U.K. litigation , Dr. Rima had access to both the headline reports an d the underlying data for those reports. T he underlying data includ ed the CT number, RNA extraction d ata, the CT for the GA PDH in th e same run, the results for the known positive an d negative stand ards, the actu al cop sam ples in the sam e run . Snyder T r. at 850A. In Co lten's ca se, Dr. Rim a had none of that background data to examine . There were se veral d iscrepan cies in t he way Unig rted their copy This reference to Fed.R.Evid. 803(6) does not imply that I applied the rules of evidence to534 determine any fact in issue in this case, to include determining the reliability of Unigenetics testing. Rather, looking to the reason behind this exception to the hearsay rule, laboratory reports have indicia of reliability. Those indicia are lacking in Unigenetics' results. The actual copy number is different from the reported copy number. The reported copy535 number, 3.7 x 10 copies per nanogram of total RNA, is a figure derived from dividing the actual copy4 number by the amount of mRNA in the GAPDH housekeeping gene in the same sample volume. Snyder Tr. at 869A-72A. 269numbers. The most distu rbing one was th e way Unigenet ics han dled discord ant results. If one run showed a resu lt of zero and the next run of the sam e sample showed a result of 2,400, Unigenet ics w ould repo rt the sam ple a s positive at 2,400 copie s. This ha ppened frequent ly. Doct or Rima called this re portin g met hod bad science . Snyder T r. at 865A. His experience in review ing the backgroun d data at Unigenetics d emonstrated that many of the high rep orted headline figures w ere the result o f low copy num bers o f both the targeted substance and GAP DH. Furthe r, ma ny of the copy numbers fell outside t he bottom range o f the stan dard curve Unigenetics d eveloped . Snyder T r. at 878A. Doctor Rim a pointe d to many examp les of this p ractice in Table 3, Section B , of his rep ort to the U.K. court, filed a s Snyder Re s. Ex. S a t 15-17. If the stan dard curve w as determine d by using 50 , 500, 5,000, 50,000, 500,000, and 5,000,000 copies of the known target, with th e copies d etermine d based on runs performe d on dilutions of the known target, the unknown sam ples sh ould test between 50 and 5,000,000 for a valid quan tification to be made. Most of Unigenet ics' sam ples fell be low the lowest num ber o n their stan dard curve, an d any copy num bers rep orted would be based on an extrapolat ion. Docto r Rima ca lled th is a \"de plorab le way of doing a test .\" Sn yder T r. at 873A-74. The same headline f igure could be derived from several dif ferent sets of data, but it is de pendent on the copy number from the run and the copy number of GAP DH in the sam ple. For exam ple, the 167,000 figure reporte d for Michelle Ce dillo's sam ple could have been based on 167,000 copies o f the F gene and 100,000 copies of GAPDH. It could a lso ha ve been based on a run showing 1.67 million cop ies of the F gene, and 1,000,000 copies of GAP DH, or on a run showing 167 copies of the F gene and 100 copies o f GAP DH, since t he figure reporte d is d etermine d by dividing the F gene co py num ber b y the GAP DH copy num ber. Snyder T r. at 875A-76A . The \"per nanogram o f total RNA\" is ba sed on the fact that 100,000 copie s of GAP DH is the equiv alent of a nanogram of RNA. S nyder T r. at 874-75A. Withou t the underlying data , it is im possib le to determine h ow the h eadline f igure reported by Unig enetics w as derived. High copy num bers were no t necessarily the result o f low CTs; h igh copy num bers d id no t necessarily imply a large quan tity of the target su bstance in the sample am plified. Snyder T r. at 876A-77A . In Colten 's case, no data on the number o f copies was produ ced. Snyder T r. at 877A-88A . (b) Bradst reet 2004 Paper and U.K. Litigation Data. Doctor Rim a illustrat ed some of the prob 2 004 paper, Snyder Pe t. Ex. 188. Data from Table 2, Snyder Pe t. Ex. 188, p. 42, was reprod uced on slide 8 , Snyder Re s. Tr. Ex. 4. S nyder T r. at 884A. Base d on Dr. Rima's a ccess to the U.K. litigation data, he was able to find b ackup data conce rning the other two children upon whom Dr. Brad street 's pap er was based , but 270not Colten 's dat a. The additiona l informa tion conce rning Child 1 and in Dr. Bradst reet's a rticle ap peared o n slide 8, with th eir nu mbers from the U.K. litigation materials (w ith Child 1 appearing as n umber 4 90 and Child 2 as n umber 2 65 on Dr. Rima's slide 8). Snyder T r. at 885-86A. Child 1 in Dr. Brad street 's article (Child 4 90 on Dr. Rima's slide ) had 2.42 x 107 copie s of measle s virus F gene per nan ogram o f total RNA. That result meant that536 every bit o f mRNA in th at ch ild's CSF cells was me asles F gene, with no roo m left for anything else, not even t he other mRNA ne cessary f or cells to live and function. Docto r Rima called this \"com plete ly and utterly implau sible.\" S nyder T r. at 886A-87A . The result f or Child 2 (in Dr. Brad street 's article), who w as Child 265 on Dr. Rima's slide , had similarly hig h, and equally implau sible, co pies o f measle s virus F gene per nanogram. Snyder T r. at 887A-89. Doctor Rim a's cha rt (slide 8) sh owed the actu al figures f or GAP DH and F gene copie s from which t he headline figures reporte d by Dr. Brad street were d erived. In both cases, the GADPH a mounts were e xtremely low , which is w hat would be expecte d in CSF since the cell cou nts a re low in CSF. Ba sed on the method for com puting the headline results, a low den ominato r (the G APDH cou nt) guaran teed a high resu lt for the headline figure. In Colten 's case, given the type of material bein g tested , it is reaso nable to infer that the cell cou nt, and hence the GAP DH coun t, would b e low. Allelic discrimina tion tests were run a year lat er on the CSF sam ples f rom Child 1 and Child 2 . Both tested negative f or measle s virus in t he CSF. S nyder T r. at 902. Base d on all the evidence he had acce ss to from the U.K. litigation , Dr. Rima conclude d that any RNA in t he CSF of these two children was based on contaminatio n. Snyder T r. at 903. Doctor Rim a noted that Dr. B radstree t's 20 04 article ref erenced informa tion not contained in Colten 's hea icating tha t measle s nucleoca psid p rotein was found in the three cases. Doctor Rim a did no t kno w where this in forma tion came from, but noted that he found no evidence regarding te sting f or measle s virus prot eins in the material h e examined for the U.K . litigation. Snyder T r. at 893-94A. Another criticism of Dr. Brad street 's resea rch w as voiced b y Dr. W ard in testim ony in Cedillo . In persistent measles b rain inf ection (SSPE ), the re is a pattern of higher an tibod y titers in CSF th an in blo od. In Dr. Brad street 's resea rch, th e measle s antibody levels w ere lo wer in t he CSF tha n in the bloo d, which would te nd to indicate there was no persisten t brain inf ection by the vaccine strain measles virus. Ced illo T r. at 1831-32. Simple mathematics proves Dr. Rima's point. Converting the reported figure of 2.42 x 107 536 results in 24,200,000 copies of the measles F gene per nanogram of total RNA. The total amount of all mRNA in a cell is only 200,000 copies. 271F. Ap plying Althe n. In their p esta of Althe n's three factors by a onderance of the evidence . Sndyer Pet . Post- Hearing Br. a t 2, 7. Petitione rs incorpo rated by ref erence th e legal a rguments conce rning w hat constitute s proo f of the Althe n factors from the post-hea ring brief s filed in Cedillo (pp. Hazlehurst (pp. ring Br. . Petitione rs correctly noted that scien tific certain ty regarding cau sation is no t required b y the Vaccine A ct, and that a showing that a vaccine was a sub stantial factor in cau sing the injury is suf ficient. Snyder P et. Post-Hearing Br. at 7. In the Cedillo P et. Post-Hearing Br. at 184, inco rporate d by reference in the instan t case petitione rs atte mpted to reformu late the Althe n test. They argued that a showing that a petitione r: \"(1) w as health y (or m ore h ealth y); (2) received a covered vaccine ; and (3) su bseque ntly suf fered an injury that, in th eory can b e caused by the vaccine ; and (4) e xperien ced the onset o f sympto ms within a n appropriate time after the vaccine\" w as held to be sufficient e vidence of causation in a number of cited case s, and therefore o bliquely argued that this shou ld be the test for cau sation . This reformu lation neglects to in clude the statutory requireme nt that a petition er de monstrat e \"by a preponderance of the evidence \" that the inju ry in quest ion was cau sed by the vaccine (\u00a7 300aa-13(a)(1) (emp hasis a dded)), a st andard the specia l masters f ound to be met in those cited case s. In the Cedillo P et. Post-Hearing Br. at 172, petitione rs sugg ested that the \"stand ard o f proo f\" is relaxed in V accine Act cases. In Vaccine A ct case s the stan dards of admissibility are relaxed, in that the technica l rules o f evidence do not apply. See \u00a7 300aa-12(d)(2)(b) (\"flexible an d informa l stan dards of admissibility of evidence \" to b e used ). The difference between \"sta ndards of dards of admissibility\" may be simp ly one of sem antics, or p etition ers' cho ice of wording m ay be d elibera te. The Vaccin e Act requires pe titione rs to p rove their case by the preponderance of the evidence. \u00a7 300aa-13(a)(1). T hat proo f may be a dduced by less f orma l proce sses a nd relaxed sta ndards for ad missibility of evidence . The preponderance of the evidence stan dard in Vaccine Act cases involv ing an off-Table in jury is the sam e sta ndard ordin arily used in tort litigation . Hines F.2 d at 1525; Althe n, 418 F.3 d at 1278. Und er that standard, the petitione r must sho w that it is \"more prob able than not\" th at the vaccina tion was th e cause of the injury. Althe n, 418 F.3d at 1279. What is dif ferent in V accine Act cases, and one of the reaso ns proof of actual cau sation is ea sier f or pe titione rs und er the Vaccine Act, even in off-Table ca ses, than in traditio nal civil li tigation, is tha t the methods of proo f are relaxed, in that the rules o f evidence do not apply, and petitione rs nee d not establish ne gligence, defective design, m anufacturing fla ws, or, indeed, any tort cause of actio n, merely cause of injury . See \u00a7 300aa-12(d)(2). The Althe n factors provide the frame work for de termining if petitione rs have m et 272their burde n to demonstrat e that a vaccine cau sed the injury claimed . 1. Medical T heory. Althe n requires m ore than merely a me dical th eory. Pet itione rs mu st offer a biologically plau sible m edica l theory. See Walthe c'y, HHS , 485 F.3 d r's theo must be repu table). T he theory of measle s virus cau sation is ne ither b iologically plausible n or repu table, in view of all th at is kn own abo ut measle s viral inf ection s of the brain. Not a single m easle s virologist cam e forward to testify on behalf of petitione rs. Every measle s virologist w ho testif ied st ated that the theory advance d by petitione rs flew in th e face of decade s of resea rch an d clinical e xperien ce with bot h the wild-type and vaccine strain s of the virus. Doctor G riffin did not con sider th e theory that the measle s vaccine vir us persiste d and cause d disease in both the gut an d the brain to be biolo gically plau sible. Cedillo T r. at 2795A-96 . What measle s virus do es when it enters th e brain is well- known, an d it d oes not prod uce symptoms or d amage con sistent with autism . Ced illo Tr. at 2796-97. Petitione rs correctly noted that the medica l theory proffered to explain ho w a vaccine could cau se an inju ry need not be one reco ntified b y a pathologic ma rker. In their view, a theory is suf ficient, if \"supp orted by com petent evidence .\" Sn yder P et. Post-Hearing Br. at 7-8 (em phasis ed), citing Capiz zano and Knudsen \"Comp etent\" was no petitio m issing fro m of the medica theory pron g of Althe n is the requireme nt that such a theory be reliable.

Daub ert requires tha t an opinion be supp orted by som ething mo re than subje ctive belief; it m ust b e groun ded \"in th e methods and proce dures of science .\" A non-exclusiv e list o f factors to b e conside red in evaluatin g an e xpert's o pinion are: (1) whether the theory is acce in the scient ific com munity; (2) w hether it has been subjecte d to peer review and publicat ion; (3) w hether it can be or ha s been teste d; (4) and whether the known po tential error rate is acce ptable. Kumho Tire , 526 U.S. a t is clea r that petitione rs' theo ry is no t gene rally acce pted. There was no evidence that the measle s virus cou ld cau se ASD, o nly speculat ion that it might. T here are n o articles sup portin g Dr. Kinsbou rne's th eory that persistent measles virus cause s 273brain inflammation of the type see n in ASD b rain p athophysiology . At best, th ere is some evidence of an ongoing inf lammatory process in ASD, b ut no ind ication that it is virally-cause d. The excitation-inh ibition theory is likew ise un supp orted in th e peer reviewed medical litera ture; at best, there is so me speculatio n that so me ASD symptoms may be a reflection of an excitatory- inhibito ry imbalance. And as for the MINE the ory, it has not been subject to peer review , and after Dr. Dyken's edito rial, ha s apparently never again resurf th e medica l or scien tific literatu re. The theory rests o n one key piece o f evidence : test resu lts from a lab orato ry that is no longer in e xistence and whose p ractices a nd methods were seriously f lawed. In Daub ert's term s, Unigene tics' rate ptable. Docto r Rima's resp onse to one of my question s provided a cogent rea son for so conclu ding. He noted that Unigenetics was the only labo ratory comm ercially testing blo od ce of measle s virus. S nyder T r. at 927A. He th en commented: Let me explain this. I mean, if the tech nology had been validated , then Dr. O'Lea ry would have found me and Oldsto ne and several oth er pe ople intere sted in m easle s virus at his d oor sa ying, can you help us re solve issues a bout not only this d isease . I can give you o ther disea ses where there is a question about the forma tion of measle s virus in - - d isease , in otoclerosis. A nd I'm involv ed in several of these inst ance s where people are st ruggling to f ind a link or a n etiology for a disea se which ha s no known etio logy. And so, if inde ed that techno logy had been validated , if that indeed had been the circumst ance , a lot of people would have knocke d on O'L eary's lab an d said you can do som ething w hich we can 't do. And there would h ave bee n a flood of people com ing to h im independent of the litigation o f som e. But that flood hasn't ta ken place for the very simp le rea son that every one who has looke d at it sa id, no, actually, this tech nology does not work. W hat he claim s he can do he cann ot do. What he claim s, he simp ly has not been able to give us the sort o f confidence in his te chno logy that would allow us to start looking at it from a rese arch p erspe ctive. That's a rese arch p erspe ctive. That is a very different perspective even f rom the perspective of a diagnostic lab that is going to t est ch ildren f or pa thological cond itions t hat there are. So I would have said I would h ave bee n the first at h is doo r...Bu t it was clear that the company tha t was set u p by Unigenet ics had only one trading activity and that was to test measles p resen ce in samples f rom the litigants in th e U.K ...We came quickly to the conclusion that som e of the practice s tha t I described here, so me of the slopp iness, some of the incon sistencie s in th e data were there and they led us to the conclu sion that this simp ly does not work. Snyder T r. at 927A-29. 2742. Logical Se quence of Cause and Effect. Unde r Althe n, the logical seque nce of cause and effect m ust b e supported by a \"reputa ble m edica l or scien tific explanat ion, i.e., by evidence in the form of scient ific studies or e xpert medical te stimo 418 F.2d at 1148.

Petitione rs' ex perts and fact witnesses attempted to establish th e logical conn ection between Colten 's vaccina tions The ry and of a co nnection was Unigene tics' test results. For rea sons explained at length, supra , I find in sufficient in dicia o f reliability in Unigenetics' te sting program in general, and in Colte n's resu lts in p articular, t o show the p resen ce of measle s virus in his bra in. T he lack of a logical conne ction in the CSF re sults is a mply demonstrat ed by the amount of measle s virus RNA pu rported ly found, an amount too great to be biologically plau sible. Abse nt evidence of persisting mea sles vir us, Dr. K insbo urne was unwilling to opine in favor of vaccine cau sation in Colte n's case . This te lls me that Dr. Kinsb ourne reaso ned backwards. From the prese nce of measle s virus, h e developed a theory about how the vir us co uld ca use brain inflammation and damage the excitation- inhibitio n balance in brain chem tism's sympt oms. Unf ortun ately, his theories a re no t logical, ba sed on every thing kno wn about measle s virus. W hen measles virus persists, it kills w ithin m onths or years. Doctor B radstree t's op inions on causa tion informe d his treat ment of Colten , and for that reason , if for no other, th ey warrant consid eratio n. It is clea r that Colte n's cond ition m aterially improved between the time he began sp eech therapy in April, 1 999, and the time of the hearing. Howev er, it is f ar from clear th at Co lten's im proveme nt was due to Dr. Bradst reet's t reatm ent. It is even less clear th at the treatments were designed to remo ve a dangerous virus f rom his bo dy, and the evidence that any of the treatments were cap able of doing so is no nexistent. Colten 's pare nts cle arly believed in Dr. Brad street 's treat ment regimen. They saw ev idence of behavioral respo nses to IVIG and secret in therapy, and rep orted their obse rvation s to health ca re providers, inclu ding tho se other than Dr. Bra dstree t. Their subje ctive beliefs also warrant caref ul con siderat ion. Howev er, th e objective evidence 275regarding Dr. Bradstree t's the rapies is not particularly persuasive. Colte n got worse when chelated . Secretin may have help ed with bowel sy mptoms, an d even with behavior, but, objectively , secre tin has been shown to be ineffective in au tism treatment. As Dr. W iznitzer note d, Co lten had digestive and allergy prob lems tha t may have be en helped by dietary restrictions. Colten 's pare nts cle arly believed that IVIG therapy helpe d Colte n. Altho ugh m y detailed review of Colten 's me dical reco rds, a nd a comparison of those reco rds against objective me asure s of his p erforma nce in scho ol and speech therapy make s me, like Dr. Skod a-Sm ith, le ss san guine a bout IVIG's effectiveness, even acce pting th eir asse ssme nt not 's claim for causa tion. IVIG th erapy has not been shown to be effective against m easle s virus. I t has not been shown to be effective in trea ting ant i-MBP ant ibodies, a prob lem that had disap peared b y the time the treatment was initia ted, and which did not appear to resurf ace during th ose period s when IVIG therapy was su spen ded. The many dietary supp lements may or ma y not have helped Colte n, but, again, t here were n o rea sons advance d to connect them to co untering persisten t measle s virus. I am unconvinced that Dr. Brad street 's treat ments sp an the gap b etween t he theory of measle s virus pe the prese nce of a persiste nt measle s virus in h is brain. Snyder T r. at 452A-52B . Howev er, th e absen ce of any credib le evidence that Colte n actually had measle s virus in h is brain elimin ated the connector be tween Dr. Kinsb ourne's th and Colten 's cond ition. 3. A Pro ximate Temporal Relation ship. The best that can be said about this asp ect o f petitione rs' case is t hat the probable onset o f Colten 's regression in la nguage o ccurred a fter his vaccina tion, altho ugh th e videos d emonstrated som e early, sub tle ind icators o f com municatio n and socialization d ifficulties m onths prior to th e vaccinatio n. Onse t after vaccinatio n is n ot enough, sta nding alone , to satisf y Althe n's third prong. Pet itione rs have th e burden to demonstrate the existence of a \"scien tific tem poral relation ship.\" F.3 d 1352 (Fed. Cir. 200 6). T he time frame must be medically accepta ble. De Ba zan, 539 F.3 d at 1352. Doctor K insbo urne opined that the sympt oms must h ave ma nifested after vaccina tion for him to opine that the vaccine caused the condition . Snyder T r. 536A- 37A. Becau se his opin ion was so cle arly based on the manifestation of autistic regression as an indicat ion that \"som ething\" w as happening in the brain at that time, it appears t hat the temporal relation ship b etween vaccinat ion a nd manifestation of regression ha d to be reaso nably close. He d id no t place an absolu te outer limit of how soon after th e vaccinatio n the sympt oms had to manifest. He co uld n ot opine on how long af ter vaccinatio n the virus m ight ent er the brain. Cedillo T r. at 530-32A. Thus, it appears h e did no t kno w what a biologically appropriate t emporal relation ship would b e, altho ugh his t estim ony in Cedillo suggested t hat, after wi th onset greater th an three months post-vaccina tion, he would be less wil ling to op ine that the MMR v accine 276cause d ASD. Ce dillo T r. Drs. Kin sbou rne a nd Bradst reet opined that the onset of Colten 's PDD- NOS was in ea rly May, 199 8. For the reaso ns noted above, I do not acce pt the factual prem ises up on which t hese opinions are b ased because they conflict w ith contemporaneously cr eated, and rea sona bly detailed , medica l records. There was no clear d emarcatio n point established for Colte n's loss o f skills. T o the extent that petitione rs rely on Colten 's May and June, 1998 illnesses f or on set a nd conn ection to his vaccination , the pharyngi tis, fever, and weight loss a ll ma nifested prior to h is MMR vaccina tion. I find that his sp eech prob lems began at som e point between when he was 17 and 19 months of age, a t a time when his im mune system was functioning no rmally, and there was no evidence th at he had a delayed rea ction to his me asles vaccine. The immune system t esting do ne when he was 16 months old (du ring his hosp italization ) and by Dr. Otegbeye several w eeks later d emonstrated that Colte n's im mune system was functioning ap propriately af ter his vaccina tion. His IgG levels w ere e ntirely norma l. Doctor K insbo urne relied in som e measu re on a malfunctioning im mune system to explain why Colten allegedly f ailed to cle ar the virus. The objective evidence is th at at the time Drs. Kin sbou rne a nd Bradst reet claime d his symptoms manifested, Co lten's immune system was f unctioning ap propriately. In her first report to a health care p rovider o f behaviors consiste nt with ASD, Mrs. Snyder pla ced onse t when Colte n was 19 months of age. Dating it to when Dr. Otegbe ye reco y (altho ugh he did not note it a s such ) would place onset o f word lo ss at 17 months of age. This tim e frame fits squarely w ithin t he period when most p arents no tice loss of skills or de velopmental plate aus, acco rding to t he testim ony of respo ndent's e xperts. It is also co nsisten t with the evidence that stron gly genet ic disorde rs can manifest a t pre-programm ed time frame s, lon g after birth, wi thout any outside trigg ering events. Doctor K insbo urne may have relied u pon the appearance of sympto ms of MIBE (mon ths a fter vaccinatio n) an d SSPE (years a fter vaccinatio n) for the lack of any firm outer limit. If he were rea sonin g by analogy to these co nditio ns, it would not matter when the sympto ms manifested. This is yet an other examp le of Dr. Kinsb ourne \"cherry -picking\" data that ports his hypoth esis, b ut blithely ig noring f acts t hat contradict it. If he relied upon the slow action of measle s virus in S SPE for the outer limit o f a temporal relation ship, he was ignoring the damage to n eurons and the progressiv ely debilitatin g men tal sta tus that occu rs when measle s virus invades the brain and persists the re. If Dr. Kinsb ourne adopts the three-m onth outer limit he allud ed to in Cedillo , it is possib le that Co lten's lo ss of skills ma nifested within tha t time frame .
