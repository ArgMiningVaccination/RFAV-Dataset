[JYNNEOS](https://www.fda.gov/vaccines-blood-biologics/jynneos) vaccine is FDA-approved for prevention of smallpox or mpox disease. - Supply of JYNNEOS vaccine continues to be managed by HHS to ensure equitable distribution. - JYNNEOS should be administered as two injections (two-dose series). - The two doses should be given 28 days apart (range 24-35 days). - If the second dose was not given during the recommended interval, it should be given as soon as possible. - Peak immunity is anticipated 14 days after the second dose. - JYNNEOS is indicated in people who are determined to be at high risk for smallpox or mpox infection. The FDA-licensed administration route is subcutaneous (standard regimen). Under an Emergency Use Authorization (EUA) beginning August 9, 2022: - People 18 years of age or older may receive JYNNEOS via intradermal (ID) administration (alternative regimen). - People younger than 18 years old or people of any age who have a history of developing keloid scars may receive JYNNEOS via subcutaneous (SC) administration (standard regimen). - The EUA for JYNNEOS remains in effect, even though the PHE has expired. - During the current mpox outbreak, the intradermal route is preferred because it would substantially increase the number of available JYNNEOS vaccine doses, while maintaining immunogenicity in vaccinated persons. However, concerns about intradermal administration should not be a barrier to vaccination. Either the standard (0.5mL Subcut) or the alternative (0.1mL ID) regimen may be used. Providers may discuss with patients to determine which route of administration each patient prefers. - Early data [evaluating the safety](https://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/volumes/71/wr/mm7149a4.htm?s_cid=mm7149a4_w) and [effectiveness of the JYNNEOS vaccine](https://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/volumes/71/wr/mm7149a5.htm?s_cid=mm7149a5_w) did not identify any new safety concerns and observed a reduction of mpox incidence of 9.6 times among persons who received 2 vaccine doses or 7.4 times among persons receiving 1 mpox dose compared to unvaccinated persons. [Vaccine effectiveness ranges from 66-89% for the two dose series, and 36-75% after one dose](https://www.cdc.gov/poxvirus/mpox/cases-data/jynneos-vaccine-effectiveness.html). JYNNEOS should be prioritized for people who are at high risk for severe disease from mpox (including but not limited to people with HIV, pregnant, or other immunocompromising conditions) or serious adverse events with ACAM2000. - JYNNEOS is safe for administration to people with HIV and atopic dermatitis. - JYNNEOS is shipped at -20\u00b0C and requires cold chain management. - When stored at -20\u00b0C, labeled expiration date applies. - Expiration dates are found on the carton but not on the vial itself. Expiration dates may also be found at the [ASPR Website](/sns/Pages/mpox.aspx). - When thawed and refrigerated at a temperature of 2\u00b0C-8\u00b0C, unopened vials can be stored for up to 8 weeks based on FDA-issued EUA Fact Sheet for JYNNEOS and information provided in the [manufacturer's letter](mailto:letter@https://aspr.hhs.gov/SNS/Documents/MVA-BN-Information-Ltr-Effective-14June2022.pdf) (this differs from the package insert). - JYNNEOS is administered with a needle/syringe; SNS does not provide ancillary supplies. [ACAM2000](https://www.fda.gov/vaccines-blood-biologics/vaccines/acam2000) vaccine is FDA-approved for the prevention of smallpox disease, and is allowed under a CDC-held Expanded Access IND (EA-IND) for the prevention of mpox disease. - There is a plentiful supply of ACAM2000. - ACAM2000 is administered percutaneously as a single dose, using a bifurcated needle. - ACAM2000 is indicated in adults ages 18 years or older; it has a number of contraindications due to its adverse event profile. - ACAM2000 should not be given to people with the following conditions: - Three or more cardiac risk factors (hypertension, diabetes, hypercholesterolemia, heart disease at age 50 years in a first-decree relative, or smoking) - Eye disease treated with topical steroids - Congenital or acquired immune deficiency disorders, including those taking immunosuppressive medications and people living with HIV (regardless of immune status) - Atopic dermatitis/eczema and persons with a history of atopic dermatitis/eczema or other acute or exfoliative skin conditions - Infants less than 12 months of age - Pregnancy and breastfeeding - History of a severe allergic reaction (e.g. anaphylaxis) after a previous dose of ACAM2000 - ACAM2000 is shipped at -20\u00b0C and requires cold chain management. - Stored at -20\u00b0C, unopened vials are good until the printed expiration date - Once thawed and stored refrigerated at 2\u00b0C-8\u00b0C, unopened vials must be used within 18 months - Ancillary kits are provided by SNS More information on these vaccines can be found at: [Interim Clinical Considerations for Use of JYNNEOS and "}
