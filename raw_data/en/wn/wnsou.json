What do you believe in? Here at ASD we believe with the right support, Deaf children can be just as successful as their hearing peers. At ASD, each child has full access to language and to professionals specifically trained to foster their succes s. We look forward to seeing each student transform into an educated and confident learner this year. Dear Parents and Students: Welcome to the 2022- 2023 School Year! It is my hope that you will have a rewarding year as a LEOPARD. This Handbook was written to help you gain the greatest possible benefit from your school experience. We want school to be a place to experience the excitement of learning, as well as a place where students, parents and school staff form a partnership. Working together, there is no limit to what we can achieve. We are proud to provi de a world -class education for Deaf and Hard of H earing students. To ensure each student has t he best preparation for your future career, we are continuing the rollout of our innovative learning environment through the 1:1 laptop program. To be successful, you will need to be able to work collaboratively, think critically, and use 21st century technologies to be productive and efficient. This parent/student handbook is only the introduction to your school program. After reviewing it for general information, I encourage all parents and students to become actively involved in the ASD experience. GO TEAM! Dr. Janet Dickinson 12 Introducing Governor Hutchinson Governor Hutchinson has shown tremendous interest and support for Arkansas School for the Deaf. Over the past few years, he has welcomed our Championship Girls Basketball Team to the Capitol; he awarded our Art students with the Governor's Art award , and he toured our facilities and shared his pride in our new campus vision. Recently, Governor Hutchinson awarded ASD & ASBVI over $36 million to address significant life and safety needs on campus. With these funds, we are building a new School Health Center and addressing other safety and facilities needs on our campus. We are grateful for his support and care for ASD. Governor Hutchinson has won recognition for the state as a leader in computer science education, garnering acknowledgment from the White House, national media outlets, and major tech companies. Growing up on a small farm in Gravette, Arkansas, he understands the needs in our state. He is a graduate of the University of Arkansas law school. He and his wife, Susan, have been married 45 years, and they have four children and six grandchildren. Introducing Secretary Key On March 25, 2015, the State Board of Education approved Johnny Key to be the chief school officer of the Arkansas Department of Education (ADE). Governor Asa Hutchinson then recommended Key for the position of secretary. Secretary Key graduated from Gurdon High School and received a Bachelor of Science in Chemical Engineering in 1991 from the University of Arkansas at Fayetteville. He began his career in public service in 1997 when he was elected to serve as a justice of the peace on the Baxter County Quorum Court. He was elected to three two -year terms in the House of Representatives, followed by a tenure in the Senate that began in 2008. Under Secretary Key's leadership, ADE has focused on the vision of transforming Arkansas to lead the nation in student -focused education. The goal is to provide leadership, support, and service to schools, districts, and communities so every student graduates prepared for college, career, and community engagement. This vision guides the daily work within the agency. Under the new transformation model, Arkansas School for the Deaf became a division of ADE. Since this change in organizational structure, Secretary Key has been a strong advocate for our school. He has personally supported and strengthened our reputat ion across the state. We are gra teful for his leadership and vision to ensure deaf children have the highest quality education and care. 13 Introducing our Board of Trustees The Arkansas School for the Deaf's Board of Trustees consists of five members, each appointed by the Governor by and with the advice and consent of the Senate. At least one member of the board must be a Deaf person. The Arkansas School for the Deaf's Board of Trustees meets on a monthly basis, usually on the 3rd Tuesday of each month. We greatly appreciate the time, wisdom , and energy our Board of Trustees give to ASD and our students. 14 ASD MISSION The mission of Arkansas School for the Deaf is to empower Deaf, Deaf- Blind, and Hard of Hearing children to become highly effective communicators who are educated, motivated and independent. At ASD, students are transformed into confident young people inspired to achieve their goals with the skills to succeed in a competitive world . ASD VISION Arkansas School for the Deaf is an inspired community committed to achievement, innovation , collaboration , and excellence. Achievement At ASD, students belong, excel and thrive. ASD prepares students from birth to age 21 to be college and career ready by ensuring students achieve the essential skills of a rigorous curriculum in a bilingual environment where ASL and English are equally valued. Innovation ASD implements bold and creative strategies, connecting ideas and technologies to meet the changing needs of our students, maximize their success, and enhance ASD's reputation as the Arkansas resource center on deafness, and a premier leader in bilingual e ducation. Collaboration ASD nurtures interactions within our community, as well as creating partnerships locally and globally, to bring new opportunities to our students and to strengthen the future of ASD. Excellence ASD recognizes excellence as equipping a diverse community of promising young people to go out in the world with the confidence to lead lives of integrity, purpose and achievement in an increasingly global society . ASD SLOGAN 15 WHAT WE BELIEVE ABOUT DEAF CHILDREN Bilingual Belief Statements Arkansas School for the Deaf is an accessible ASL/English bilingual community in which people who are Deaf, Hard of Hearing, and hearing learn and work together without language and communication barriers. At Arkansas School for the Deaf, we have the following beliefs: 1. We recognize that students coming to Arkansas School for the Deaf have diverse cultures, backgrounds, and language abilities. For some students, America n Sign Language is their first language. For some students, Spoken English is their first language. For some students, another cultural signed or spoken language is their first language. Some students come to ASD with no language. 2. We believe that American Sign Language and English are equal and separate languages. Both languages allow Deaf children the ability to access academic information, interact effectively with others, and express themselves creatively. 3. We believe that every student has a right to a language rich learning environment, where he/she has full access to clear communication and language. 4. We believe students need to learn how to interact successfully in both Deaf culture and hearing culture. Culture and identity development are important for every child to develop self -worth and self -confidence. We believe Deaf students need real life exposure to experiences in order to increase their understanding of and ability to successfully interact in the hearing community. We believe De af students need Deaf role models and experience in the Deaf community to increase their understanding and ability to successfully interact in the Deaf community. 5. We recognize and respect each student's individual needs and abilities. We believe that ever yone is equal and important, regardless of hearing levels, their preferred communication mode, and their cultural identity 6. We believe that in order to optimize student achievement, Deaf children must have early exposure to a rich and comprehensive language . Therefore, it is our priority to: Meet these needs on our campus by providing programs, resources, and support to families of young Deaf children to foster their exposure to a full language. Meet these needs statewide through a responsive and supported S tatewide Services program. 7. Research shows that there are significant advantages to being bilingual, and we believe that Deaf children have a right to be bilingual. Students should have access to meaningful instruction in both ASL and English (written & spoken). Both languages should be equally celebrated and students should be equally proud of their achievements in both languages. Gaining fluency in ASL has a positive impact on the language and conceptual development of all students. Students should have access to quality curriculum and instruction in the linguistic structure of ASL, designed to increase both incidental and academic ASL. Students should also have quality assessments to monitor their progress in acquiring language. Students with the ability to communicate through spoken English should receive quality instruction to increase 16 their skills in both incidental and academic spoken English, as well as quality assessments to monitor their progress. Lip reading can also serve as an additional tool to increase the child's communication opportunities. To the greatest extent possible, students from other cultural families, such as Spanish speaking families, should receive support for learning their family's heritage language. Technological devices (hearing aids, cochlear implants, etc.) serve as tools to help students achieve more success in gaining listening and spoken English skills. We believe it is important to provide our students up- to-date information and support in accessing and maximizing the success of these tools. We respect students' and families' decisions to choose either to use or not to use technological devices. We believe Deaf students need strong English skills to function independently in a hearing world, and t o maximize their future success. Mastery of written English includes both being able to read and comprehend complex texts, and being able to express oneself through written English. 8. We believe that Deaf and Hard -of-Hearing children benefit from interaction with Deaf and Hard -of-Hearing peers and role models. Access to Deaf role models enhances their understanding of the language, culture, and gives them a view of what success looks like as a Deaf adult. 9. We believe that to successfully meet the diverse need s of future generations of Deaf and Hard of Hearing students, the following are essential: Comprehensive state -of-the-art classrooms, instructional strategies, and resources to maximize each student's learning of ASL Comprehensive state -of-the-art classroo ms, instructional strategies, and resources to maximize each student's learning of English. 10. We, the staff and faculty of ASD, believe that to foster double pride in our students, we must first have double pride ourselves. We realize that it is essential that we have fluent skills in both our native and non -native languages in order to provide a high quality bilingual instructional environment. 17 PARENT INFORMATION Visiting the School The Arkansas School for the Deaf welcomes visitors, especially parents, to our campus. We believe that all information (written and observed) belongs primarily to the students and/or parents and the school. Information that is disclosed to \"third parties \" obligates those parties to safeguard and protect the confidentiality of any personally identifiable information. The administration asks that anything you, as a visitor, see, hear, or observe during your visits not be shared. This is a protection of a student's civil right to privacy. Only visitors who have legitimate educational interests in our students will be allowed to visit the classroom. Visiting Hours and Rules Visits to the classes or academic activities should be arranged through the building principal. ASD students who have withdrawn from ASD for disciplinary reasons or were expelled may not return to visit ASD. Visitors such as ASD alumni must obtain permission from the building principal or superintendent before visiting the campus. The school officials reserve the right to prohibit any visits within reason. Visitors must sign in at the administration office and obtain a visitor's badge to be worn while on campus. Visitors will be asked to wait in the reception area until the person they have come to see arrives to meet them or someone is available to escort them to the appropriate area. The contact will be responsible for the visitor(s) during their time on campus and will escort them back to the reception at the end of their visit. Visitors will be accompanied, or supervised, during the whole of their time at the school. Badges are to be returned to administration when leaving campus. Contact by Parents Parents wishing to speak to their children during the school day shall register first with the building office. Custodial parents/legal guardians may visit their student at any time. Other family members may visit the campus if accompanied by the custodial parent/ legal guardian of the student. ASD adheres to the Family E ducational Rights and Privacy Act of 1974. Custodial parents/legal guardians must provide the appropriate legal documentation concerning custody/guardianship for their student attending ASD at the beginning of the school year. Any changes should be immediately forwarded to the Student Services office. It shall be the responsibility of the custodial parent to make any court ordered \"no contact\" or other restrictions regarding the non- custodial parent known to the principal by presenting a copy of a file -marked court order. Without such a court order on file, the school will release the child to either of his/her parents. Non- custodial parents who file with the principal a date -stamped copy of current court orders granting visitation may eat lunch, voluntee r in their child's classroom, or otherwise have contact with their child during school hours and the prior approval of the school's principal. Contact by Non -Custodial Parent If there is any question concerning the legal custody of the student, the custodial parent shall present documentation to the principal or his/her designee establishing the parent's custody of the student. Unless prior arrangements have been made with the school's principal, Arkansas law provides that the transfer of a child between hi s/her custodial parent and non- custodial parent, when both parents are present, shall not take place on the school's property on normal school days during normal hours of school operation. The provisions of this policy do not prohibit one parent (custodial or non -custodial) from transporting the child to school and the other parent (custodial or non- custodial) from picking the child up from school at prearranged times on prearranged days if prior approval had been obtained from the school's principal. 18 It is the parent's responsibility to keep addresses and all other personal information current in the school office. Non -custodial parents with visitation rights may request current scholastic records. Parent -Teacher Communication ASD recognizes the importance of communication between teachers and parents or legal guardians. To help promote positive communication, parent -teacher conferences shall be held once each semester. Parent -teacher conferences are encouraged and may be requested by parents/guardians when they feel they need to discuss their child's progress with his/her teacher(s). Teachers are required to communicate during the school year with the parent(s), legal guardian(s), or caregiving adult(s) to discuss the student's academic progress unless the student has been placed in the custody of the Department of Human Services and the school has received a court order prohibiting parent or legal guardian participation in the parent/teacher conference. More frequent communication is required with the parent(s) or legal guardian(s) of students who are performing below grade level. All parent/teacher conferences shall be scheduled at a time and place to best accommodate those participating in the conference. Each teacher shall document the participati on or non -participation of parent(s) or legal guardian(s) for each scheduled conference. If a student is to be retained at any grade level, a letter of notice and the reasons for retention shall be communicated promptly in a personal conference. PARENT AND FAMILY ENGAGEMENT PLAN Introduction The goal of the Arkansas School for the Deaf is to work together to create learning opportunities for academic excellence and personal independence. We recognize that a child's education is a responsibility shared by the school and the family. Because we know that parents and families who are involved in thei r child's education promote a higher rate of student success, we have developed a parent and family engagement plan to enhance the engagement of parents and families and to reflect the specific needs of the students at the Arkansas School for the Deaf and their families. To Involve Parents and Families of Students at all Grade Levels, ASD shall: Provide a variety of roles for parents and families to become involved in the education of their student . This can be done through volunteer activities, learning activities that support classroom instruction, participation in school decisions, collaboration with community resources, development of school goals and priorities, and evaluating the effectiveness of the comprehensive school improvement plan (ACSIP). 19 Examples at Arkansas School for the Deaf include but are not limited to: ASD will schedule a \"Report to the Public\" where parents are given a report on the state of the school and an overview of curriculum, assessment, expectations of both parents and tea chers, and how parents can assist and make a difference in his or her child's education. Home Room Parents: volunteers for activities, parties, field trips, special events, etc. Parent and Family Volunteers: making copies for teachers, helping gather resources, volunteering in the classrooms, concession stands at games, etc. Community and Family Members: support students in community service projects, collecting pop tabs for education, career activities, guest speakers, and other school activities. Include parents in a variety of engagement groups such as the VIP Parent Planning meetings which include fundraising opportunities and new family mentoring programs; parent and family involvement events such as ASL classes, Silent Sunday, and the school carnival and other volunteer opportunities. Sign in sheets will be provided for parent and family engagement activities. Wellness Clinics : Parents may assist in organizing, promoting, and implementing good health. Flu shots are given in the fall to all studen ts and faculty members free of charge through coordination with the AR Department of Health To Encourage Communication with Parents and Families , ASD shall: Provide information packets to be distributed annually to the parent of each student. These packets will include school calendars, schedules of special events, school handbook, supply lists, and ways for parents and families to become involved. Packets wil l be distributed at registration, Parent Nights, or during conference times. Maintain regular, two -way communication. Make the district's website, www.arschoolforthedeaf.org, available to parents , guardians , and families to provide information concerning t he school and the schools' activities. Send home classroom and school -wide newsletters on a regular basis. Utilize \"SchoolMessenger,\" an email and text message system, to help keep parents and guardians notified of up-to-date announcements, weather closings, school news, and events. Provide interpreters at Parent Teacher Conferences and other programs and events on campus. Utilize the Interpreters to communicate with non -English speaking parents. Plan activities throughout the school year to encourage parent and family engagement and communication. To Promote and Support Responsible Parenting, ASD shall: Recognize parent and family engagement through local media including feature articles and/or pi ctures. Create a school newsletter to be distributed to all parents in the student homework folder. Send home a monthly calendar of scheduled school, class, and dorm events. Offer American Sign Language classes free of charge to parents and families of stu dents. Provide online podcasts on the school website as an opportunity for parents/families to learn American Sign Language. Hold an annual review, other than parent teacher -conference, to ensure parents and families understand their role in their child's education. Provide reading information on nutritional facts ; and send school menus sent home weekly. Involve parents and family on the ACSIP committee. 20 District Level Communication 21 Student Recognition We will develop and implement a system for recognizing and rewarding the achievement of all students, including Team Ready students, to include but not limited to honor roll, perfect attendance, President's Physical Fitness Awards, and Student of the Month. We will inform parents of rewards and enc ourage them to participate in recognition events : we will invite all parents and families , including the parents and families of Team Ready students, to attend scheduled academic competitions or school performances which are aligned to curriculum standards such as academic, physical, dramatic, and holiday programs, and/or competitions. We will also provide opportunities for parents and families to eat lunch with their children in the cafeteria. Thanksgiving and Christmas meals are held annually and planned around school performances and classroom activities. Parent -Teacher Conferences All teachers will meet with parents or guardians of each student at least once a semester through parent/teacher conferences, telephone conferences or home visit. Conferences for the 2022- 2023 school year will be held November 4, 2022 and April 10, 2023. Teachers will communicate more frequently if additional support is needed. Information concerning the course selection process for smart core and core is included in the student handbook. Collaborating with Community Resources A parent and family council has been established to provide advice and guidance for school improvement. This Parent Meeting occurs on the first Thursday of each month from September to May, at 5:00 p.m. in the Board Room located in the Nutt Athletic Complex. The Council's goals consist of: Involve community patrons in the ACSIP plan for school improvement as participants in advisory capacities. Work with community/business members to help with and promote activities within the school to strengthen school programs, family practices, and student learning. Ask for volunteers to visit classrooms. Ask for monetary or human resource support for activities/programs Conduct surveys at least annuall y to identify additional engagement groups are desired. Identified needs will be addressed by the committee. ASD will annually review and update the parent and family engagement plan and give it to the superintendent. The administrators of ASD will designa te at least one certified staff member that is willing to serve as parent facilitator to organize meaningful training for staff and parents promoting and encouraging a welcoming atmosphere to parent and family involvement. Show parent and family engagement as an asset to the school. Support the development, implementation, and regular evaluation of the program to involve parents in the decisions and practices of the school district by including parents and families in the ACSIP plan and handbook revisions Parent and family evaluation surveys will be disseminated each year and will be included as a part of the school/district evaluations of programs. 22 CAMPUS INFORMATION Expectations of Students Students have the responsibility to pursue their education at the Arkansas School for the Deaf in a manner that shows respect for other students, staff member s, parents , and other citizens. Students should be aware that they have a responsibility to assist the school staff in the orderly and efficient conduct of the school by abiding by rules and regulations established by the school and implemented by teachers and administrators. Each student is responsible for his or her own conduct at all times. Period of Silence Arkansas Code \u00a7 6-10-115 requires a period of silence at the beginning of each school day. Teachers are to ensure that all students remain silent and do not interfere with or distract another student during the period of silence. During the one -minute period of silence, students may reflect , pray, or engage in a silent activity. Religion in Schools Public funds must be spent in compliance with the First Amendment of the U.S. Constitution, which prohibits the United States government from favoring or disfavoring any one religion. Because ASD receives federal funds, it is prohibited from fostering or precluding religion. ASD respects the religious expression and freedom of conscience of all students. School Substitute Meals The district only provides substitute meal components on menus t o accommodate students with conditions meeting the definition of a disability as defined in USDA regulations. A parent/guardian wanting substitutions for his/her child must submit a letter to ASD's Director of Food Services. Special dietary requests mu st be accompanied by a doctor's written orders. Inclement Weather Policy During periods of time that students are on campus, ASD will remain open regardless of inclement weather. Twenty four -hour coverage will be maintained. If students are not on campus when inclement weather occurs, administration will decide if the buses wi ll run. If the ASD Inclement Weather Policy is placed into effect, notice shall be given on local TV channels and http://www.arschoolforthedeaf.org. When inclement weather occurs during school hours, the Superintendent will have the discretion to allow s tudents and employees to leave work or school early for safety reasons only if there will be sufficient supervision for students remaining in dormitories. Alternative Method of Instruction (AMI) ASD has a 1:1 digital device program that allows for e -instru ction for middle school and high school students on days when weather prevents students from attending school. While having a digital computing device is a significant step in providing instruction on weather related closing days, we also realize that some students may not have access to internet. Therefore, we will design lessons that are internet independent, which are still comparable to the learning opportunities that would have been provided if school had been in session. These independent lessons will be 23 bundled into \"ASD Packet\" and will align with the e -learning opportunities and will be distributed to students in early fall. Students will be required to log on to their Google Classrooms with their 1:1 electronic device. For students who do not have internet access at home, or for our younger students, they will have the option of showing attendance through completion of their \"ASD Packet\" projects. Age of Majority Per Arkansas Code \u00a7 9 -25-101, Students reach the age of majority when they turn 18 years old. The reference in any policy of ASD to a \" parent or guardian of a student\" will not be valid for students who have reached the age of majority (18 years old) because such students will be considered responsible for their own decisions and actions. Whatever your age, if you are a student, you must follow rules and re gulations of the Arkansas School for the Deaf. In the event that a court appoints guardianship of a student of the age of majority to another person due to the student's lack of capacity, the guardian(s) shall provide the court order and letters of guardi anship to ASD administration. ASD will comply with court orders regarding who will make decisions on behalf of a student who lacks capacity. If you are 18 years old and are no longer living with your parent/guardian(s), you may continue to attend school fr om the school district in which you live. You will need to enroll in the new school district and notify ASD Student Services of the change. If you are under 18 years old, you must attend school in the attendance zone of your parent/guardian(s), unless you are in one of the following situations and have received a reassignment from the Student Services Office: Legally married; Parent or guardian(s) have given legal custody of you to another person; or Courts have given guardianship of you to the state or some person other than your parents. Student ID Badges Student IDs are required for each student attending ASD and must be worn as directed by the Principal. Every student will receive their first ID at no charge. It is the responsibility of the student to maintain the whereabouts of their ID badge. If an ID is lost or damage, a student will need to report to the Dean of Students. Students can either: A. Bring signed form from Dean of Students to allow student to pay a fee of $5.00 to replace the ID B. Perfo rm on -campus community service as directed by the Dean of Students to obtain a form upon completion for replacement of ID. Textbooks and School Supplies Textbooks are the property of the State of Arkansas and are for the use of students only. They are provided for student use free of charge. Students are responsible for lost or damaged books and will be expected to pay for replacements. Each student will furnish his/her own school supplies. Parents/guardians should check with their student periodically to determine if additional supplies are needed. Library Materials Library materials are checked out for two (2) weeks and may be renewed; however, the Media Specialist may recall materials. Materials will be selected and retained according to curriculum needs, the mission, and goals of the school. 24 School Telephones/Vid eophones The telephone/videophone in the office is to be used by students for emergencies only. Students may use the telephone/videophone with approval by office personnel. Dress Code The Arkansas School for the Deaf believes that ASD's education program is designed to promote learning and to teach grooming and hygiene, instill discipline, prevent disruption, avoid safety hazards , and respect for authority. ASD strives to create a cu lture that promotes and fosters respect for oneself, as well as others, sensitivity to the diverse population in which we live, and a true understanding of the value of education. As a part of that culture, the way students dress has a definite impact on their learning environment. Anything that detracts from this purpose, whether it is behavior or dress, will not be tolerated. Students are expected to attend school looking clean, neat and dressed in a manner that promotes a positive, caring , and safe env ironment. The appearance of any student is the primary responsibility of both the student and the parent. We do not intend to dictate the type of clothes to be worn to school, but occasionally we find it necessary to say what shall not be worn. Students a re here, first and foremost, for academic reasons. ASD would like to encourage students to make appropriate choices regarding their appearance and type of clothing. Health and safety need to be considered when dressing for school. To accomplish this task, ASD has established the following guidelines for appropriate dress at ASD during the regular school day and at school day and at school sponsored activities and events. If your child does not comply with the dress code expectations, then he/she will be sent back to the dorm/home to change clothes. Although ASD recognizes that dress is a matter of personal taste and expression of oneself, it also recognizes the need to help students understand and avoid the negative impact that inappropriate grooming can have in the classroom. Dresses, Pants, Shorts, Skirts Dresses, shorts and skirts: must be no more than six inches above knee. Boys shall wear pants or shorts and a shirt. NO clothing that exposes underwear or buttocks (Ark Code \u00a7 6-18-503) NO holes - no exposed skin NO pajamas or lounge wear NO spandex (leggings, jeggings) unless covered by another garment NO clothing related to gangs (one leg of pants rolled up; towels hangi ng from any pocket or draped over shoulder; overalls with one strap unbuttoned; bandanas, etc.) Shirts Dresses, shirts, and blouses must not expose any part of the midriff or back. NO see- through blouses NO clothing that exposes the breast of a female (Ark Code \u00a7 6-18-503) NO halters, backless, fishnet, or tank tops; no spaghetti straps NO revealing necklines - there should be NO cleavage showing NO emblems, insignias, badges, or other symbols worn that would mock, ridicule, or demean others because of race, religion, national origin, or other individual views NO suggestive slogans (such as Hooters); vulgar captions; pictures or advertisement for tobacco or alcohol products; logos that depict death or violence 25 Shoes and Head Coverings All students must wear shoes Elementary school students are discouraged from wearing flip -flops and thongs because of safety reasons on the playground. Middle School and High School students may wear flip- flops to school but must change shoes for classes with shoe requirements. Students who are enrolled in PE, CTE and Science classes may have shoe requirements. No house shoes except in the dormitory No blankets or bedding No baseball caps, hats, sweatbands, sunglasses, combs, picks, curlers, or rakes - male or female. Please remember ALL students go outside daily. We would greatly appreciate our students being properly dressed for school and activities out of school. Students participating or attending other educational programs are responsible for following that progra m's established dress code. The school reserves the right to prohibit attire that does not comply with the required dress code. Any student failing to follow the above requirements will be subject to disciplinary action. STUDENT TRANSPORTATION The Medical Release and Transportation Agreement form is used to indicate standing permission by the custodial parent/legal guardian for ASD to transport their student. Any temporary change, such as a permission to visit another student or riding another bus, must be made in writing and submitted to dorm supervisor by the Tuesday before the weekend of the change. Only changes by the custodial parent or legal guardian using the form will be accepted. Permanent additions must always be made by custodial parent or legal guardian and can be made at any time. Transportation - ASD Bus Rules Students are expected to follow all established rules when utilizing transportation. Failure to follow the rules can compromise the safety of all passengers. Acts of misconduct on the bus are subject to disciplinary action up to and including suspension or expulsion from school. When students are suspended from riding a bus, parents may become responsible for transporting their children to and from school. Students will stand back ten (10) feet from the bus and wait until the door is opened before moving closer to the bus. While waiting, students are not to play on the highway or road. Unauthorized conduct at the bus stop, such as fighting or damage to property, may be subjec t to action by local police as well as from the school. Students will not be permitted to board or leave the bus at any place other than their destination. When entering or leaving the bus, students should proceed in an orderly manner, without delay. Students on buses are under the supervision of staff and are to always follow staff directions.

A Picture of the Student ATTENDANCE POLICY If any student's Individual Education Program (IEP) or 504 Plan conflicts with this policy, the requirements of the student's IEP or 504 Plan take precedence. Compulsory Attendance as Required by Arkansas Law Every parent, guardian, or other person having lawful control of any child age five (5) through seventeen (17) shall enroll and ensure the attendance of the child at a public, private, or Parochial school or provide home school for the child with the following exceptions. 1. The child is enrolled in private or parochial school. 2. The child is being home -schooled and the conditions of policy (4.6\u2014 HOME SCHOOLING) have been met. 3. The child will not be age six (6) on or before August 1 of that particular school year and the parent, legal guardian, person having lawful control of the child, or person standing in loco parentis of the child elects not to have him/her attend kindergarten. A kindergarten waver form prescribed by regulation of the Division of Elementary and Secondary Education must be signed and on file with the District administrative office. 4. The child has received a high school diploma or its equivalent as determined by the State Board of Education. 5. The child is age sixteen (16) or above and is enrolled in a post -secondary vocational -technical institution, a community college, or a two -year or four -year institution of higher education. 6. The child is age sixteen (16) or seventeen (17) and has met the requirements to enroll in an adult education program as defined by A.C.A. \u00a7 6 -18-201 (b). Students should attend school unless illness or extenuating circumstance justifies an absence. Students are required to maintain prompt and regular attendance in accordance with school policy. Parents have the responsibility to monitor attendance and to familiarize themselves with policies pertaining to the educational program of the school. Tardies Elementary and Middle School late arrivals must be accompanied by the parent/guardian to be signed in. High school students that arrive 5 or more minutes late to school must sign in at office and bring a note from parent/guardian or staff member with reason for tardiness. Those who do not have a note or pass will be given an unexcused tardy. Absences If any student's Individual Education Program (IEP) conflicts with this policy, the requirements of the student's IEP take precedence. Education is more than the grades students receive in their courses. Regular attendance at school is essential to their social and cultural development and helps prepare them to accept responsibilities they will face as adults. Interaction with other students and participation in the instruction within the classroom enrich the learning environment and promote a continuity of instruction which results in higher student achievement. 30 Excused Absences are defined as follows: Excused absences are those where the student was on official school business or when the absence was due to one of the following reasons: 1. The absence was due to illness and the student brings a written statement to the principal from the parent or legal guardian within 2 days of the absence and stating such reason. 2. If the student's illness could jeopardize the health of other students . 3. Head lice infestation is excused for one day per occurrence . 4. Death or illness of a family member 5. Observance of recognized holidays observed by their religion. 6. Attendance at an appointment with a government agency. 7. Attendanc e at a medical appointment . 8. Participation in an FFA, FHA, or 4- H sanctioned activities . 9. Exceptional circumstances with prior approval of the principal . 10.

Absences granted, at the Superintendent's discretion, to seventeen (17) year- old students who join the Arkansas National Guard while in eleventh grade to complete basic combat training between grades eleven (11) and (12) . 14. Students who serve as pages for a member of the General Assembly shall be considered on instructional assignment and shall not be considered absent from school for the day the student is serving as a page . 15. Students who attend in- school suspension shall not be counted absent for those days. 16. High School Juniors and Seniors will be allowed 3 days excused absences to visit prospective colleges. 17. Absences for students excluded from school by the Arkansas Department of Health during a disease outbreak because the student has an immunization waiver or whose immunizations are not up to date. If the School Nurse has issued a recommendation for an excused absence from classes for the day, the sa me restriction shall prevail at night. In cases of extreme emotional distress, the School C ounselor may excuse absences, at which time the same restriction shall prevail at night. Unexcused Absences Absences not defined above or not having an accompanying note, e -mail, text, or telephone call from the parent or legal guardian to the school secretary, presented within 2 days of the absence, shall be considered unexcused absences. The maximum number of unexcused absences allowed by ASD is ten (10) per semester . Students who miss up to three (3) unexcused days within a school year will have their parents/guardians contacted by the school. The office will notify the parents/guardians after the first unexcused absence. The school counselor may be contacted to offer help to the student and/or student's parent or guardian; however, the office and building level administrator will be responsible for contacting the parent once the maximum number of absences have been accumul ated. When a student has had five (5) unexcused absences in a school year, the student is identified as a Chronic Truant (CT) and the student's attendance records will be flagged. Once a student is has been identified as CT, ASD will send a letter to the parent(s) or guardian(s) advising that, under Arkansas law, ASD is required to notify the prosecuting attorney after exceeding ten (10) unexcused absences and a Family In Need of Services (\" FINS \") petition could be 31 filed with the circuit court . ASD will call a meeting to discuss attendance concerns along with parents/guardians and school personnel. Excessive Unexcused Absences When a student has had ten (10) unexcused absences in a school year, the student is identified as a Habitual Truant (HT) and the student's attendance records will be flagged. When a student exceeds ten (10) unexcused absences in a semester, the district shall notify the student's parent and the local prosecuting authority, and the parent or guardian may be subject to a civil penalty through a family in need of services (FINS) action in circuit court . Students with ten (10) or more unexcused absences in a course in a semester may fail to receive credit for that course. At the discretion of the principal after consultation with persons having knowledge of the circumstances of the unexcused absences, the student may be denied promotion or graduation . Excessive absences shall not be a reason for expulsion or dismissal of a student. A t any time prior to a student exceeding the number of unexcused absences permitted by this policy, the student, or his/her parent or guardian may petition the school or district's administration for special arrangements to address the student's unexcused absences. If formal arrangements are granted, they shall be formalized into a written agreement which will include the conditions of the agreement and the consequences for failing to fulfill the agreement's requirements. The agreement shall be signed by the student, the student's parent or guardian, and the district administrator or designee. Students receiving suspension will be charged with unexcused absence for the number of days serving out of school suspension. ASD is required to notify the Department of Finance and Administration whenever a student four teen (14) years of age or older is no longer in school. The Department of Finance and Administration may suspend the former student's operator's license upon notification. Course Audit Policy The maximum number of unexcused absences allowed per class is 10 for classes that meet daily. (See Attendance Policy) Student may be placed in audit status for the course(s) that apply. When a student is placed on audit status, he/she may not receive a credit at the end of the semester for that class. In instances where a student's excessive absenteeism is due to reasonable causes, i.e., serious/prolonged illness, serious/prolonged injury, family emergency, etc., the student will not be placed on audit status. However, absences will still be monitored. A combination of absences due to non- school related reasons which cause the student to exceed the maximum allowed by this policy will result in the student being placed on audit status. Absences for School Sponsored Activities A student may be excused for school -sponsored activities. These absences are not recorded as an absence from school and the student has the right to complete all assignments made during his/her absences. Assignments must be completed within a reasonable time period as determined by the instructor of any classes missed. No student may participate in any school activity (athletics, concerts, plays, etc.) or practice for such an event on a day when the student was absent . This absence will be evaluated by the principal before the student can be declared an eligible participant of the school activity. 32 Absences for Medical Reasons If a student's medical treatment will require excessive absences, the student's parent or guardian may petition the school administr ation for special arrangements to address the student's absences. The petition must be made before the student accumulates 16 absences ; and allow exceptions as necessary to satisfy an Individualized Education Program (IEP). This policy will not waive the requirement to file a FINS petition if a student exceeds the set number of unexcused absences. This policy will allow a student having excessive absences because of illnesses, accident, or other unavoidable reasons be given assistance obtaining credit fo r enrolled courses. ACADEMIC PROGRAMS At ASD, each student's academic program is designed with a focus on their individualized plan and the Arkansas Curriculum Frameworks. The Arkansas Curriculum Frameworks clearly describe what students must know and be able to do in each academic content area. ASD's teachers are skilled in designing rigorous instruction to meet the child's individual needs resulting in academically competent students who can apply their knowledge and skills. Under the Individual s with Disabilities Education Act (IDEA), children with hearing loss are entitled to either a 504 plan or an Individual Education Plan (IEP). 504 plans only provide accommodations. They are utilized for children who have hearing loss but are performing well and have no other educational needs. They can provide for accommodations such as: additional time for assessments and frequent checks for understanding. IEP plans provide accommodations as well as specially designed instruction. They provide support for children who have hearing loss and need more help. They can provide the same accommodations as a 504 plan but have the ability to go beyond. Early Leap (Ages Newborn - 3 years) The Early Leap Program offers both home visits and play groups for very young children. EARLY LEAP is a family - centered program for infants and young Deaf or Hard of Hearing children. Services through this program are offered statewide and occur in the child's most natural learning environment - home and community. EARLY LEAP se rvices are designed to strengthen family communication and encourage the development of language and social skills at an early age. Because early access to language and communication is critical to a child with hearing loss , the EARLY LEAP staff focus on building communication skills necessary to: Enjoy a relationship with family members Reach important developmental milestones Access information Tell you how he /she feels Make friends Play Preschool Age Children living Outside of the Little Rock Area: The EARLY LEAP staff members are available to conduct periodic home visits with families of young Deaf and Hard of Hearing children or meet with local preschool staff to support early learning. For more information, contact the Early Leap Statewide Services o ffice. 33 Early Childhood Center The Arkansas School for the Deaf's Preschool program is a continuum of bilingual curricula for children ages two to five years. The curriculum is child -centered and project -based to provide each child a nurturing and developmentally appropriate educational environment. All aspects of the curricula focus on using research- based principles of learning and childhood developmental milestones as the foundation for lessons and activities. Teachers design plans and organize the classrooms to promote each child's social -emotional, cognitive, and physical development based on individual strengths and interests. Children actively play and learn in the following center s: Blocks, Drama, Table Toys, Art, Sensory, Technology, and Literacy (Reading and Writing). Children experience a variety of gross motor activities, both indoor and outdoor, on a daily basis. Assessment Teachers and assistants evaluate each child's progre ss through portfolio assessment. Parent -Teacher conferences are held at the end of each semester to review progress and plan goals for the child. Portfolios are given to the family at the end of each semester. Communication between home and school is very important. Communication between teacher and parent will be ongoing through Student Communication Books, monthly newsletters, emails, and/or personal communication. If you have a change in plans regarding pick up time, doctor's appointment, or another important message, please write in the student's communication book or on a note. For a daily class schedule, please contact the Principal. Elementary School (Grades K -5) The primary goal of the Elementary Program is to provide students with a strong academic foundation for success when they transition to middle school and high school. Therefore, students develop critical literacy fluency in two languages - English and ASL. Caring adults who are licensed teachers provide bilingual , bicultural experiences that support each child's self - esteem and pride in family, community, ethnic, and linguistic heritage. We view ourselves as members of a world community with a variety of values and traditions. We feel that educa tional opportunities to learn about and value other cultures and traditions are important to the understanding and respecting of one's own individual culture and traditions. Daily Schedule Please see your child's classroom teacher for the classroom sched ule. Class begins at 8:00 a.m. and dismissal is at 3:30 p.m. Monday through Thursday. Dismissal on Friday is at 1:00 p.m. Elementary Groups ASD Elementary School categorizes grade levels Group 1 Kindergarten -2nd Grade Group 2 3rd, 4th & 5th Grade Elementary Grading and Evaluation Grading System for Group 1 - Skills Check List PA = Progressing Appropriately PS = Progressing with support AC = Area of concern NI = Not initiated 34 Grading System for Group 2 (Grades for Grades 3 -4) A 100- 90 B 89-80 C 79-70 D 69-65 F 64 and below Middle Scho ol (Grades 6 - 8) The ASD Middle School is comprised of the sixth through the eighth grades. When students enter our doors, we focus on one goal - give them the skills they need to be successful in their chosen college and/or career pathway. Since reading , writing, and computing are skills basic to success in our society, we believe that the teaching of them is not restricted to any one academic discipline but is rather a shared responsibility of students and teachers. Students experience two important transitions: from elementary school to middle school and from middle school to high school. During these transitions, students experience significant physical, social, emotional, and cognitive growth. Our middle school teachers and staff serve as instructo rs and role models to help students achieve personal and academic success during those times of growth. Many middle grades students are not concerned with looking beyond the next ballgame or party. Although they participate in job exploration and guidance activities, they may not realize the importance of the middle grades to their future education and caree rs. At ASD, our goal is to help students learn to set goals for themselves, and to leave the eighth grade ready to succeed in challenging, college and career preparatory courses in high school. Middle School Schedule Some classes will be assigned double p eriods - to create a block schedule. Extended class periods allow teachers more opportunities to implement differentiated instruction strategies and to provide deeper learning. Provide additional opportunities for remediation, guided practice, and/or enrichment and extension all in the same class period. Students take four classes each nine weeks. For a class schedule, please contact the Principal. High School The ASD High School is more than just another high school. Coursework and instruction are specifically tailored to give Deaf and Hard of Hearing students the support and high expectations needed to succeed. Today's students live in an era driven by math, science, technology, and information. Consequently, we must prepare them with the essential skills they need to prosper in a data- based economy. With the new 1:1 Laptop Program , students gain significant experience in accessing and learning through tech nology. The ASD High School is both a traditional comprehensive high school and a recently redesigned focus on technical education (CTE) to ensure that ASD graduates leave with the skills and abilities to thrive their chosen career. The most notable recent change is a greater connection between our students and the business community. Quarterly, Deaf professionals from the local and national community come share their experiences with ASD students. They describe how they achieved success. Also, our students have increased opportunities to visit a variety of workplaces, shadow professionals, and even work in the business community. High School Schedule Some classes will be assigned double periods - to create a block schedule. Extended class periods a llow teachers more opportunities to implement differentiated instruction strategies and to provide deeper learning. Provide additional opportunities for remediation, guided practice, and/or enrichment and extension all in the same class period. Students take four classes each nine weeks. For a schedule, please contact the Principal. 35 Grading and Evaluation - Middle School & High School Parents or guardians shall be kept informed concerning the progress of their student. Parent -teacher conferences are sc heduled annually, but also may be requested at any time by parents, guardians, or teachers. If the progress of a student is unsatisfactory in a subject, the teacher will reach out to parents to promote teamwork in addressing concerns. The teacher will explain the reasons for difficulties and will develop, cooperatively with the parents, a plan for remediation which may enhance the probability of the student succeeding. The school will also send timely progress reports and issue grades for each nine -week gra ding period to keep parents/guardians informed of their student's progress. Middle School Grading Scores for Grades 6 - 8: 90 - 100 Grade Point = 4 80 -89 Grade Point = 3 70 - 79 Grade Point = 2 60 - 69 Grade Point = 1 59 and below Grade Point = 0 Middle School students who enroll and pass the ADE Approved Algebra 1 course earn one credit toward their high school credits. High School Grading Scores for Grades 9 - 12: 90 - 100 Grade Point = 4 80 -89 Grade Point = 3 70 - 79 Grade Point = 2 60 - 69 Grade Point = 1 59 and below Grade Point = 0 The e-School program that produces student report cards computes the student GPA automatically according to numerical grades and number of classe s. Honor Roll High School and Middle School Honor Roll will consist of the following levels: High Honors 4.0 - 3.70 Honors 3.69 - 3.40 with no course score below 80 Honorable Mention 3.39 - 3.25 with no course score below 80 The e-School program that produces student report cards computes the student GPA automatically according to numerical grades and number of classes. Student Acceleration The School be lieves that acceleration is an effective and research -based intervention for the academic growth of students who are ready for an advanced or faster -paced curriculum. It can allow a student to move through the traditional educational setting more rapidly, based on assessed readiness, capability and motivation. At the same time, the School understands that acceleration is not a replacement for gifted education services or programs. Generally, acceleration can occur through one of two broad categories: content based and grade based. Grade based acceleration shortens the number of years a student would otherwise spend in K -12 education, while content based acceleration occurs within the normal K -12 time span. Either form of acceleration can be triggered by a parent/guardian, student, or community member's request or by the referral of school personnel. 36 Student Promotion and Retention A disservice is done to students through social promotion and is prohibited by state law. The District will, at a minimum, evaluate each student annually in an effort to help each student who is not performing at grade level. ASD will keep p arents or guard ians informed regarding the progress of their student(s). Notice of a student's possible retention or required retaking of a course will be included with the student's grades sent home to each parent/guardian or the student if 18 or older. Parent -teacher c onferences are encouraged and may be held as necessary in an effort to improve a student's academic success. Promotion or retention of students or their required retaking of a course will be a team decision based on the best interest of the student. If th ere is doubt concerning the promotion or retention of a student or their required retaking of a course a conference between the parents/guardians, teacher(s), special education representative, the principal, and other pertinent personnel will be held before a final decision is made. The conference will be held at a time and place that best accommodates those participating in the conference. The school will document participation or non -participation in required conferences. If the conference attendees fai l to agree concerning the student's placement, the final decision to promote or retain shall rest with the principal or his/her designee. Promotion, retention, and graduation of a student with an IEP will be done in consultation with the student's IEP team. ASD Learning Center - Tutoring Program The Arkansas School for the Deaf Tutoring Program is a service for students who require or request additional support with homework and classwork. Tutoring support helps students build necessary skills, complete key assignments, and receive additional monitoring and support. Students can get help with specific subject areas (math, science, humanities, Spanish, etc.) or with general study skills such as homework management, organization, and test preparation. Teachers or parents can also refer students who are in need of additional assistance simply by emailing the Tutoring Program Coordinator. The Tutoring Program Coordinator recruits and organizes volunteer tutors (including peer mentors, alumni, parents, and volunte ers from the community), then matches them with students, either one- on-one or in small groups. In addition to matching tutors with students the Tutoring Program also provides: A safe space to study without the stigma of \"special needs\" The program welcomes any student who wants to ask a few questions or even just sit quietly and do homework in the company of others. Students of all levels are encouraged to take advantage of the Tutoring Program to help maximize their opportunities for success in high school. Healthy snacks to help students focus Food initially attracts many students to the program and often motivates them to continue attending. We typically have water and fruit available during the school day as well as a nutritious after school snack Monday - Thursday, 3:45pm - 4:45pm. Students who voluntarily extend their school day need additional nourishment to continue focusing on their studies so late into the afternoon. A welcoming atmosphere with academic and emotional support Our volunteer tutors and study coaches are dedicated to helping our students succeed! We always remember that it is not easy to be a teenager and asking for help with difficult coursework is a challenge all on its own. TUTORING HOURS Hours: 3:00 p.m. - 8:00 p.m. Monday - Thursday Office Phone: (501) 246- 8474 Mobile Tutor Hotline: (501) 410- 4701 (text only) Elementary Tutoring Program Hours: 3:30 p.m. - 7:00 p.m. 37 Make -up Work Students who miss school due to an absence shall be allowed to make up the work they missed during their absence under the following rules : Students are responsible for asking the teachers of the classes they missed what assignments they need to make up; students are required to ask for their assignments on their first day back at school or their first class day after their return. Teachers are responsible for providing the missed assignments when asked by a returning student. Make -up tests are to be rescheduled at the discretion of the teacher, but must be aligned with the schedule of the missed work to be made up. Students shall have one class day to make up their work for each class day they are absent. Make -up work which is not turned in within the make -up schedule for that assignment shall receive a zero. Students are responsible for turning in their make -up work without the teacher having to ask for it. Students who are absent on the day their make -up work is due must turn in their work the day they return to school whether or not the class for which the work is due me ets the day of their return. As required/permitted by the student's Individual Education Program or 504 Plan. Work may not be made up for credit for absences in excess of the number of allowable absences in a semester unless the absences are part of a sig ned agreement as permitted by Absences Policy. Incomplete Work With advanced notification to the principal's office and valid documentation (doctor's excuse, etc.), a grade of 'incomplete' may be given to a student when the student is excused for: a) an extended illness during a grading period; b) a family emergency during a grading period that required an extended absence; c) a short term illness or family emergency immediately preceding the end of a grading period. All incomplete grades must be removed by the end of the following reporting period. Incomplete grades given for the second semester must be made up within fourteen (14) calendar days after the last day of school. If the work is not completed during the specified time, a zero (0) will be assi gned for the missing work, and the teacher must determine the final grade for the reporting period. Exceptions to this policy will be made only with the approval of the Administration. Homework Policy Homework assigned during class to be done outside the regular class meeting time (at home, in the dormitory, or some other location), is an integral part of the educational program. Homework should be meaningful and relevant both to class work and to the student. It should help the student develop useful sk ills and gain increased insight into class work. All homework should contribute directly as well as indirectly to the student's performance evaluation. All students are expected to complete the given homework assignment within the time frame given by the teacher. Homework decisions, including due dates and extension dates, are at the discretion of the classroom teachers. Assignments will not involve skills/concepts which have not been previously taught. Students have the responsibility of having homework time scheduled after school, whether they live in the dorm or in the home, to complete their homework and to study. If the student has an excused absence from school, she/he may make up any homework that she/he may have missed. Repeated missed homework may result in a note, conference, or phone call. Parents shall be notified of this policy at the beginning of each school year. 38 Field Trips Field trips are an important aspect of the ASD educational program. Visits to the various museums, government offices, and historic sites are an integral part of the program. Trips not related to our educational program will not take place during the school day. Building Supervisor shall approve all field trips. Guest Speakers Guest speakers are an i mportant part of the educational experience at ASD. They often provide students authentic and first -hand information which supplements and enriches the education program. All speeches and presentations must be related to a particular activity or curricul um. Building Supervisor shall approve all guest speakers. Extra -Curricular Activities Participation Eligibility It is the ASD policy that extra -curricular activities, although important, will not supersede educational goals. Interruptions and absences due to extra -curricular activities will be limited. \"Extracurricular activities\" are defined as: any school sponsored program where students from one or more schools meet, work, perform, practice under supervision outside of regular class time, or are compet ing for the purpose of receiving an award, rating, recognition, or criticism, or qualification for additional competition. Examples include, but are not limited to, athletics, academic competitions, field trips, and club activities. Students must maintain a 2.0 grade point average in the term prior to their participation in the sports or academic extra -curricular activity or otherwise meet specific passing criteria for his/her classes for each midpoint and grading period. The athletic director will review interim and 9 week reports confirming eligibility for sports; the academic bowl sponsor will review grades for students participating in academic competitions . The privilege of participating in extra -curricular activities at the Arkansas School for the Dea f is earned not only through satisfactory levels of coursework but by the student's conduct and behavior. An incident report for a student participating in sports must be reviewed by the principal and coach to determine if that student should be ineligibl e for one or more sports events. An incident report for a student participating in academic competition(s) will be reviewed by the principal and sponsor in determining eligibility for competition. Any student in ISS or suspended from school may not participate in any extra -curricular activities during the suspension period. To be eligible to participate in extra -curricular sports activities, each student who participates must have a physical examination on file for the current school year with the ASD Health Services prior to the first day of practice. There are specific papers to be filled out by the family and the medical physician. Parents/Guardians are advised to schedule the annual physical during the summer to avoid any delay in their child's parti cipation in a given sport. No student will be allowed to begin practice without the physical examination. Quite often, deaf and hard of hearing students will qualify for additional therapy, such as speech therapy, occupational therapy (OT), physical therapy (PT), etc. These therapies will be listed in the IEP, along with the required minutes. Therapy Therapists as ASD are committed to providing consistent and appropriate services to all our students, as needed. Therapists will provide designated direct therapy services as indicated in student's IEPs to ensure each student has the opportunity to meet or exceed their individual potential. For provided therapies, traditional breaks of services are considered to be predictable and an unavoidable aspect of public school education. Scheduled school closures (federal and state holidays, spring break, fall bre ak, and winter break) are not included in the IEP service delivery window, as general education services are also not available during these times. 39 Excused and unexcused student absences will not require direct services to be made up, unless IEP team members raise specific concerns of regression or lack of skill development impacting their ability to make continued progress towards their special education goals. Non -Traditional Breaks/Disruptions of Services are considered to be abrupt school closures directly related to health and safety concerns of students: inclement weather, global pandemic, facility damage/concerns. During these closures student needs will be determined on an individual basis. In the event of school closure and the district utilizing their allotted AMI (alternative means of instruction) days, therapists will provide low -tech materials (paper activities, parent handouts, language logs, etc) to each student to meet their therapy needs and maintain progress towards goals HIGH SCHOOL CURRICULUM Advanced Placement and Honors \"Advanced Placement Course\" means a high school preparatory course for a College Board Advanced Placement test that incorporates all topics specified by the College Board and the Educational Testing Service on its standard syllabus for a given subject area and is approved by the College Board and Educational Testing Service. The grade point values for Advanced Placement (AP) and approved honor courses shall be one point greater than for regular courses with the exception that an F shall still be worth 0 points. Students in grade 7 -12 who take Advanced Placement (AP) courses or ADE Approved honors courses or concurrent college courses approved for weighted credit by the Arkansas Department of Education shall be graded according to the following schedule: A = 90 -100 A = 5 points B = 80 -89 B = 4 points C = 70 -79 C = 3 points D = 60- 69 D = 2 points F = 59 and below F = 0 points \"Weighted Credit\" means additional quality points for designated AP courses that will be contingent upon the teacher having obtained or is currently participating within the ATP program. Students desiring weighted credit must also take the applicable AP an d/or IB examination after having completed the entire compatible AP and/or IB course. Credit shall be given for each grading period during the course of the year, but shall be retroactively removed from a student's grade for any course in which the student fails to take the applicable AP or IB exam. Students who do not take the AP exam shall receive the same numeric value for the grade he/she received in the course as if it were a non -AP course. Students who transfer into the district will be given weigh ted credit for the AP, or ADE Approved honors courses and concurrent college courses taken for weighted credit at his/her previous school(s) according to the preceding scale. \"Honors Courses\" are those courses that have been approved by a Department of Education Committee as honors courses. Honors courses must stress higher order learning and be offered in addition to curriculum offerings required by the Standards for Accreditation, Arkansas Public Schools. If a student meets requirements for AP, or ADE Approved honors courses, classes not offered at ASD will be given through the Distance Learning Center or a local public school district. Quarterly grades will be reported to the student, his/her parents/guardian, and will be placed in the student's perman ent file. Interim reports on the student's progress, which may include written comments, will be reported 40 at least four weeks before the close of the quarter. Any time the teacher or administration believes there to be sufficient reason for additional reporting, the parents/guardians will be notified. Core subjects and academics electives will be given a grade. Each grade is converted to a numerical value. Add all numerical values and divide by the number of actual classes taken to calculate the GPA. To reach a four -year average, the student's number of classes and GPA for each semester will be used to compute that average. Concurrent Credit Ninth through twelfth grade students who successfully complete college courses from an institution approved by the Arkansas Department of Education (ADE) shall be given credit toward high school grades and graduation at the rate of one high school credit for each three (3) semester hours of college credit. Unless approved by the school's principal, prior to enrolli ng for the course, the concurrent credit shall be applied toward the student's graduation requirements as an elective. Students who take a three -semester hour remedial/developmental education course, as permitted by the ADE Rules Governing Concurrent College and High School Credit, shall be the equivalent of one -half unit of credit for a high school career focus elective. The remedial/developmental education course cannot be used to meet the core subject area/unit requirements in English and mathematics. Participation in the concurrent high school and college credit program must be documented by a written agreement between: The District's student, and his or her parent(s) or guardian(s) if the public school student is under the age of eighteen (18); the District; and the publicly supported community college, technical college, four- year college or university, or private institution the student attends to take the concurrent credit course. Students are responsible for sending the transcript for the concurrent credit course(s) they've taken sent to the Arkansas School for the Deaf in order to receive credit for the course(s ). Credit for concurrent credit courses will not be given until a transcript is received. Transcripts for students who take concurrent credit courses as partial fulfillment of the required full day of class for students in grades 9 -12 must be received by t he school within 10 school days of the end of the semester in which the course was completed. Students may not receive credit for the course(s) they took or the credit may be delayed if the transcripts are not received in time, or at all. This may jeopardi ze students' eligibility for extracurricular activities, graduation, or promotion. Students will retain credit earned through the concurrent credit program which was applied toward a course required for high school graduation from a previously attended, a ccredited, public school. Remedial classes and math classes lower than College Algebra shall not receive credit. Graduation Requirements The Arkansas Department of Education (ADE) dictates that to be eligible for high school graduation a student must earn 22 units from the categories listed in the following Smart Core and Core Curriculum summaries. In addition to the 22 units required by the ADE, ASD requires Smart Core students reading below grade level to complete 3 additional units of remedial English to be taken during the grades 9 - 11. A Smart Core student reading at grade level is not required to complete additional remedial English courses. ASD may require 25 units for graduation eligibility. ASD requires Core Curriculum students to complete 3 additional units of electives to be taken during grades 9 -11. The 3 additional required units may vary for a transferring student depending on when and at what grade level the student enrolls in the district. With the addition of these 3 units ASD requires 25 units for graduation eligibility. 41 English - 4 units English 9th grade English 10th grade English 11th grade English 12th grade or Transitional English 12 Mathematics - 4 units (or 3 units of Math and 1 unit of Computer Science*) At least one MATH unit must be taken in Grade 11 or Grade 12. Algebra I (or Algebra A & Algebra B - Grades 7 -8 or 8 -9) Geometry (or Geometry A & Geometry B - Grades 8 -9 or 9 -10) Algebra II Fourth math - Advanced Topics and Modeling in Mathematics, Algebra III , Calculus, Computer Science and Mathematics, Linear Systems and Statistics, Transitional Math Ready, Mathematical Applications and Algorithms, Pre -Calculus, or an Advanced Placement mathematics - Comparable concurrent credit college courses may be substit uted where applicable. Science - 3 units with lab experience (or 2 units with lab experience and 1 unit of Computer Science*) Biology - 1 unit (All students must have 1 unit in Biology, IB Biology, ADE Biology, ADE Approved Biology Honors, or Concurrent Credit Biology.) Physical Science, Chemistry, or Physics - 2 units Social Studies - 3 units Civics - \u00bd unit World History - 1 unit U.S. History - 1 unit Other social studies - \u00bd unit Oral Communications - \u00bd unit Physical Education - \u00bd unit Health and Safety - \u00bd unit Economics - \u00bd unit (may be counted toward Social Studies or Career Focus) Fine Arts - \u00bd unit Career Focus - 6 units *Computer Science - (optional) A flex unit of Computer Science and Mathematics, Essentials of Computer Programmi ng, AP Computer Science, or IB Computer Science may replace the 4th math requirement or the 3rd science requirement. Two distinct units of the computer science courses listed above may replace the 4th math requirement and the 3rd science requirement. If the 4th math requirement and the 3rd science requ irement have been met through other coursework, any of the computer science courses listed above may be used for career focus credit. 42 Each high school student shall be required to take at least one digital learning course for credit to graduate. (Act 1280 of 2013) Students seeking a high school diploma or high school equivalency diploma are required to pass the Arkansas Civics Exam with a score of 60% or better. (ACT 478 of 2017) CAREER FOCUS: Six (6) units All career focus unit requirements shall be estab lished through guidance and counseling based on the student's contemplated work aspirations. Career focus courses shall conform to the curriculum policy of the district and reflect state curriculum frameworks through course sequencing and career course concentrations where appropriate. The Core and career focus units must total at least twenty -two (22) units to graduate. ASD requires three (3) additional units of electives to be taken during the grades 9 - 12. Under the Core Curriculum a student needs 25 units to graduate if the student's reading level is below grade level. The additional required units may vary for a transferring student, depending on when and at what grade level the student enrolls in the district. Smart Core Curriculum & Core Curricul um Smart Core is the college and career -ready set of courses that is the default curriculum for all Arkansas public high school students. All students are required to participate in the Smart Core curriculum unless their parents or guardians, or the stude nts if they are 18 years of age or older, sign a Smart Core Waiver Form to not participate. While Smart Core is the default option, a Smart Core Waiver Form will be sent home with students prior to their enrolling in seventh grade, or when a 7 -12 grade stu dent enrolls in the district for the first time and there is not a signed form in the student's permanent record. Parents must sign one of the forms and return it to the school so it can be placed in the students' permanent records. P arents must sign an ac knowledgement they have received the policy. Those students not participating in the Smart Core curriculum will be required to fulfill the Core curriculum or the requirements of their IEP (when applicable) to be eligible for graduation. While there are similarities between the two curriculums, following the Core curriculum may not qualify students for some scholarships, and admission to certain colleges could be jeopardized. Students initially choosing the Core curriculum may subsequently change to the Smart Core curriculum providing they would be able to complete the required course of study by the end of their senior year. Students wishing to change their choice of curriculums must consult with their counselor to determine the feasibility of changing. This policy, the Smart Core curriculum, and the courses necessary for graduation shall be reviewed by staff, students, and parents at least every other year to determine if changes need to be made to better serve the needs of the district's students. The superintendent, or his/her designee, shall select the composition of the review panel. Sufficient information relating to Smart Core and the district's graduation requirements shall be communicated to parents and students to ensure their informed understanding of each. This may be accomplished through any or all of the following means: Smart Core curriculum and graduation requirements are included in the handbook; Discussion of the Smart Core curriculum and graduation requirements at the school's annual publ ic meeting, PTA meetings, or a meeting held specifically for the purpose of informing the public on this matter; Discussions held by the school's counselors or teachers with students and their parents; and/or Distribution of newsletter(s) to parents or g uardians of the district's students. 43 Valedictorian/Salutatorian A committee of High School Staff shall determine rankings of the students. This committee will consist of at least 3 members, two senior class sponsors and the secondary principal. From this ranking, the Valedictorian and Salutatorian will be determined. To be considered for Valedictorian and Salutatorian honors, graduating seniors must have a Grade Point Average (GPA) of 3.2 or better in all subjects, for their years in high school. For Valedictorian and Salutator ian honors, we will compute up to the first semester of the senior year. Should there be no student who has attained a GPA of 3.2 or better for the graduating class, the Valedictorian/Salutatorian honors will not be given. Students who transfer to ASD from other schools must be at ASD for two years to be considered for these two honors. In cases of ties, the highest GPA in the academic core classes will be considered. Core classes are English, Reading, Mathematics, Science, and Social Studies. If a tie still remains, then the GPA for all vocational courses will be computed and the highest GPA will break the tie. If a tie still exists, the highest number of grades of A will be considered, the number of B's, and so on. If, after this, a tie still exists, the number of semesters at ASD will be used. POLICY & PROCEDURES FOR A SAFE SCHOOL ASD staff is charged with the responsibility of providing an orderly and safe environment for all students in order to help them take their places as independent and productive members of society. Students will be subject to the established disciplinary regulations for any incident occurring on any property owned by the Arkansas School for the Deaf, before, during, and after school hours and also while attending school -spons ored activities on or off school property. Positive Behavioral Interventions and Supports (PBIS) The philosophy of ASD's management of student behaviors is to emphasize positive behavioral strategies when working with students. In accordance to the bel ief of positive interventions ASD has adopted a common set of core beliefs regarding discipline. NOTE: SEE PBIS GUIDELINES FOR SUCCESS - PAGE 82 PBIS emphasizes four integrated elements: 1. data for decision making, 2. measurable outcomes supported and evaluated by data, 3. practices with evidence that these outcomes are achievable, and 4. systems that efficiently and effectively support implementation of these practices. These four elements are guided by six important principles: 1. Develop a continuum of scientifically based behavior and academic interventions and supports 2. Use data to make decisions and solve problems 3. Arrange the environment to prevent the development and occurrence of problem behavior 4. Teach and encourage pro -socia l skills and behaviors 5. Implement evidence- based behavioral practices with fidelity and accountability 6. Screen universally and monitor student performance & progress continuously Corporal Punishment Corporal punishment in any form will not be used as a disciplinary measure in the schools or dorms at the Arkansas School for the Deaf by any teacher, dorm supervisor, administrator, or other school personnel. 44 Anti-Bullying Policy Bullying - the intentional harassment, intimidation, humiliation, ridicule, defam ation, threat, or incitement of violence on a continual basis by a student against another student This harassment may occur by a written, verbal, electronic, or physical act that causes or creates a clear and present danger of one of more of the followi ng: Physical harm to a public school employee or student or damage to the public school employee's or student's property; Substantial interference with a student's education or with a public school employee's role in education; A hostile educational environment for one or more students or public school employees due to the severity, persistence, or pervasiveness of the act; or Substantial disruption of the orderly operation of the school or educational environment. \"Electronic Act\" means without limitation a communication or image transmitted by means of an electronic device, including without limitation a telephone, wireless phone or other wireless communications device, computer, or tablet that results in the substantial disruption of the orderly operation of the school or educational environment. \"Harassment\" means a pattern of unwelcome verbal or physical conduct relating to another person's constitutionally or statutorily protected status that causes, or reasonably should be expected to cause, substantial interference with the other's performance in the school environment; and \"Substantial Disruption\" means without limitation that any one or more of the following occur as a result of the bullying: Necessary cessation of instruction or educational activities; Inability of students or educational staff to focus on learning or function as an educational unit because of a hostile environment; Severe or repetitive disciplinary measures are needed in the classroom or during edu cational activities; or Exhibition of other behaviors by students or educational staff that substantially interfere with the learning environment. Bullying is prohibited: While in school, on school equipment or property In school vehicles On school buses At designated school bus stops At school -sanctioned events By an electronic act that results in the substantial disruption of the orderly operation of the school or educational environment, whether or not the electronic act originated on school property or with school equipment, if the electronic act is directed specifically at students or school personnel and maliciously intended for the purpose of disrupting school. Believing that prevention is the strongest means available in eliminating bullying, the Arkansas School for the Deaf will offer programs and educational materials regarding the nature of bullying, its consequences should a child choose to engage in this type of behavior, and the procedures for reporting an incident which involves bullying. The information will emphasize that ASD will not tolerate bullying, and that school employees, volunteers, and students are encouraged to report any instances of bullying without fear of consequences. Any reports will take into account the age of the offend ing student, the level of seriousness of the behavior, and whether or not the offending student has developed a habit of engaging in bullying behaviors. Appropriate measures will be taken when dealing with such students. A school principal or his/her des ignee who receives a credible report or complaint of bullying shall promptly investigate or make a record of the investigation and any action taken as a result of the investigation. 45 Students or adults who knowingly fabricate allegations and falsely accuse a student of being a bully will be subject to disciplinary action. Individuals who withhold information, purposely provide inaccurate facts, or otherwise hinder an investigation of a student for bullying, shall be subject to disciplinary action. Reportin g Procedures Arkansas School for the Deaf will be utilizing an anonymous reporting service called \"STOPit\". STOPit services allow parents, students, or staff to make an anonymous report for bullying/cyberbulling, inappropriate student/teacher relationships, violence/threats, hazing, weapons possession, drugs/alcohol, substance abuse, and intolerance/discrimination. Students can make these reports using an app from their smart phone or on a computer. Reports will be directed to t he appropriate administrator for investigation. Any student who is a victim of bullying or who witnesses or has reliable information that a student has been victim of bullying should report the incident to the building administrator. The student's identit y will be kept anonymous if he/she feels in danger of retaliation. Any school employee who witnesses or has reliable information that a student has been a victim of bullying will report the incident to any administrator. Any school employee who reports vi olations of this policy will be immune from any tort liability that may arise from the failure to remedy the reported incident. The building administrator will act promptly to investigate all complaints of bullying. If it is determined that bullying has occurred, the administrator will discipline any student or group of students according to the consequences listed below. Cyberbullying of School Employees is expressly prohibited and includes, but is not limited to: Building a fake profile or website of the employee; Posting or encouraging others to post on the Internet private, personal, or sexual information pertaining to a school employee; Posting an original or edited image of the school employee on the Internet; Accessing, altering, or era sing any computer network, computer data program, or computer software, including breaking into a password -protected account or stealing or otherwise accessing passwords of a school employee; making repeated, continuing, or sustained electronic communicati ons, including electronic mail or transmission, to a school employee; Making, or causing to be made, and disseminating an unauthorized copy of data pertaining to a school employee in any form, including without limitation the printed or electronic form of computer data, computer programs, or computer software residing in, communicated by, or produced by a computer or computer network; Signing up a school employee for a pornographic Internet site; or Without authorization of the school employee, signing up a school employee for electronic mailing lists or to receive junk electronic messages and instant messages. Disciplinary Actions for Bullying After completing an investigation of the reported incident, a student who was found to have participated in bullyin g behavior will be subject to disciplinary action that is appropriate to the degree of seriousness of the bullying behavior. Such disciplinary actions may include: Counseling Contact by Principal or Counselor with Parents/Guardian Detention In-School Suspension Revocation of Dormitory Privileges Parent Conference Out-of-School Suspension (3 days) 46 Due Process Manifestation Determination Contact Police Expulsion Public Di splays of Affection (PDA) Arkansas School for the Deaf recognizes that genuine feelings of affection may exist between two students. We believe it is important to take a proactive approach to promoting positive and healthy peer relationships. Students are taught expectations related to appropriate and inappropriate public displays of affection (PDA). Inappropriate PDA includes physical contact that may make others in close proximity feel uncomfortable or serve as a distraction for themselves as well as innocent onlookers. Students may engage in appropriate public displays of affection. However, students shall refrain from inappropriate public displays of affection while on campus or while attending and/or participating in a scho ol- related activity. Appropriate Displays of Affection include: Holding Hands Brief Hugging Inappropriate Displays of Affection include but are not limited to: Kissing Fondling Cuddling Inappropriate Touching Excessive Rubbing/Massaging Disciplinary Actions: Inappropriate Public Displays of Affection (PDA) will not be tolerated. Students caught engaging in such practices are subject to the following disciplinary actions. 1st Offense = Verbal Warning. Parents informed of the issue. 2nd Offense = Written Warning. Parent conference on the issue. Subsequent Offenses = In-School Suspension. Parent conference on the issue. Loss of dorm level. Dating Violence, Discrimination, Harassment, and Retaliation Dating Violence Dating violence occurs when a person in a current or past dating relationship uses physical, sexual, verbal, or emotional abuse to harm, threaten, intimidate, or control the other person in the relationship. Dating violence also occurs when a person commits these acts aga inst a person in a marriage or dating relationship with the individual who is or was once in a marriage or dating relationship with the person committing the offense. This type of conduct is considered harassment if the conduct is so severe, persistent, or pervasive that it affects the student's ability to participate or benefit from an educational program or activity; creates an intimidating, threatening, hostile, or offensive educational environment; or substantially interferes with the student's academic performance. Examples of dating violence against a student may include, but are not limited to, physical or sexual assaults, name calling, put-downs, threats to hurt the student or the student's family members or members of the student's household, 47 destro ying property belonging to the student, threats to commit suicide or homicide if the student ends the relationship, attempts to isolate the student from friends and family, stalking, or encouraging others to engage in these behaviors. Discrimination Discri mination is defined as any conduct directed at a student on the basis of race, color, religion, gender, national origin, sexual orientation, disability, or any other basis prohibited by law that negatively affects the student. Harassment Harassment, in general terms, is conduct so severe, persistent, or pervasive that it affects the student's ability to participate in or benefit from an educational program or activity; creates an intimidating, threatening, hostile, or offensive educational environment; or substantially interferes with the student's academic performance. Examples of harassment may include, but are not limited to, offensive or derogatory language directed at a person's religious beliefs or practices, accent, skin color, or need for accommodation; threatening or intimidating conduct; offensive jokes, name -calling, slurs, or rumors; physical aggression or assault; graffiti or printed material promoting racial, ethnic, or other negative stereotypes; or other kinds of aggressive conduct such as the ft or damage to property. Sexual Harassment Sexual harassment of a student by an employee, volunteer, or another student is prohibited. Sexual harassment of a student by an employee or volunteer does not include necessary or permissible physical contract not reasonably construed as sexual in nature. Romantic and other inappropriate social relationships, as well as all sexual relationships, between students and district employees are prohibited, even if consensual. Examples of prohibited sexual harassment may include, but not be limited to, touching private body parts or coercing physical contact that is sexual in nature; sexual advances; jokes or conversations of a sexual nature; and other sexually motivated conduct, communications, or contact. Retaliation Retaliation against a person, who makes a good faith report of discrimination or harassment, including dating violence, is prohibited. Retaliation against a person who is participating in an investigation of alleged discrimination or harassment is also pr ohibited. A person who makes a false claim or offers false statements or refuses to cooperate with ASD's investigation, however, may be subject to appropriate discipline. Retaliation against a student might occur when a student receives threats from another student from an employee or when an employee imposes an unjustified punishment or unwarranted grade reduction. Retaliation does not include petty slights and annoyances from other students or negative comments from a teacher that are justified by a student's poor academic in the classroom. Investigation of Report To the extent possible, the district will respect the privacy of the student; however, limited disclosures may be necessary to conduct a thorough investigation and to comply with law. Allegations of prohibited conduct, which includes dating violence, discrimination, harassment, and retaliation, will be promptly investigated. If law enforcement or other regulatory agency notifies the School that it is investigating the matter and request s that the School delay its investigation, the School will resume the investigation at the conclusion of the agency's investigation. During the course of an investigation and when appropriate, the school will take interim action to address the alleged proh ibited conduct. If the School's investigation indicates that prohibited conduct occurred, appropriate disciplinary or corrective action will be taken to address the conduct. The School may take disciplinary action even if the conduct that is the subject of the complaint was not unlawful. All involved parties will be notified of the outcome of the School investigation within the parameters and limits allowed under the Family Educational Rights and Privacy Act (FERPA). 48 Closed Campus All schools in the District shall operate closed campuses. Students are required to stay on campus from their arrival until dismissal at the end of a regular school day unless given permission to leave the campus by a school official. The custodial parent or legal guardian must call the school or personally check the student out of school. Student or parents or guardian must sign out in their respective school office upon their departure. (Adopted July 16, 2013) Student Vehicles Students who have presented a valid driver's license and proof of insurance to the appropriate personnel office may drive their vehicle to school. Vehicles driven to school shall be parked in the area designated for student parking. Students are not permitted to loiter in parking areas and are not to retu rn to their vehicles for any reason unless given permission by a school administrator. There should be no expectation of privacy in vehicles parked in school parking areas. Drivers of vehicles parked on the school campus will be held accountable for illegal substances or other prohibited items found in their vehicle. Vehicles parked on campus must display a valid parking permit. Permits can be obtained at the Administration building. A replacement permit will cost $3.00. A vehicle parked anywhere other than the assigned spot without prior permission from an administrator will be subject to a parking fine or loss of parking privileges. Crisis Intervention - Emergency Drills Fire drills shall be conducted at least monthly. Tornado drills shall be conduct ed at least four times per year with at least one each in the months of September, January, and February. Students who ride school buses shall also participate in emergency evaluation drills at least twice each school year. An active shooter drill and sc hool safety assessment may be conducted in collaboration, when possible, with local law enforcement and emergency management personnel. Students will be included in the drills to the extent that is appropriate to the age of the student and grade configuration of the school. Drills may be conducted during the instructional day or during non- instructional time periods. Other types of drills may also be conducted to test the implementation of the school's emergency plans in the event of an earthquake or terr orist attack that might include the use of biological or chemical agents. Students shall be included in the drills to the extent practicable. (ASD Board approved July 16, 2013.) Drug -Free School Zone The Arkansas School for the Deaf is a drug, alcohol and tobacco free environment for all staff and students. This includes all buildings as well as state owned vehicles and on premises where school sponsored events take place. Search and Seizure School property is loaned to the students for their use and, as such, is a privilege and not a right. ASD officials reserve the right to, and will periodically, inspect school property, including lockers, desks and dorms. School officials also reserve the right to search an individual if the search is reasonable and nec essary to maintain order or safety. Notice of Drug Dog A registered, trained drug dog may be employed by officials to prevent the use and/or possession of prohibited drugs or alcohol on school property. The dog, while gentle, has been specially trained to locate marijuana, alcohol, and other illegal drugs. The dog and its handler will make periodic, unannounced visits to all educational and dormitory programs and school -sponsored activities. Lockers, dorm rooms, automobiles, and other areas of the building will be searched. Students will be held responsible for any prohibited items found in their room, lockers, automobile, or belongings at school. If prohibited items are found during a search, the violators will be disci -pl ined under ASD policies and may be prosecuted under local, state, or federal law. 49 Video Surveillance The District has a responsibility to maintain discipline, protect the safety, security, and welfare of its students, staff, and visitors while at the same time safeguarding district faciliti es, vehicles, and equipment. As part of fulfilling this responsibility, the District authorizes the use of video/audio surveillance cameras outside of any district building, on district property, automatic identification technology, data compilation device s, and technology capable of tracking the physical location of district equipment, students, and/or personnel. Video recorder placements shall be based on the presumption and belief that students, staff, and visitors have no reasonable expectation of privacy in areas or at events that occur in plain view of other students, staff, or visitors, anywhere on or near school property, facilities, vehicles, or equipment, with the exception of places such as restrooms or dressing areas where an expectation of bodil y privacy is reasonable and customary. Signs shall be posted on campus buildings and in district vehicles to notify students, staff, and visitors that video cameras may be in use. Students will be held responsible for any violations of school discipline rules caught by the cameras and other technologies authorized by this policy. The district shall retain copies of video recordings for a minimum of two (2) weeks before they are erased which may be accomplished by either deletion or copying over with a new recording. Videos, automatic identification, or data compilations containing evidence of a violation of student conduct rules and/or state or federal law shall be retained until the issue of the misconduct is no longer subject to review or appeal; any rele ase or viewing of such records shall be in accordance with current law. Video recordings shall be considered student education records and any release or viewing of such records shall be in accordance with current law. Videos containing evidence of a violation of student conduct rules and/or state or federal law shall be retained until the issue of the misconduct has been settled. Students who vandalize, damage, disable, or render inoperable (temporarily or permanently) surveillance cameras and equipme nt, or automatic identification shall be subject to appropriate disciplinary action and referral to appropriate law enforcement authorities. Policy for Violence or Threats of Violence ASD will not tolerate any violent acts or threats of violence. Disciplin ary action, up to and including expulsion, will be imposed for any violent acts. In addition, all threats of violence will be taken seriously. Disciplinary action will be imposed for any threat of violence or other expressions which substantially disrupt o r materially interfere with school activities or the educational process. Based upon this policy, ASD highly recommends that students refrain from joking about acts of violence. Any student who has been a victim of any violent act or of any threat of viole nce or any student who knows of any such act or threat should report the incident immediately to ASD personnel. Any ASD personnel to who such acts or threats have been reported must promptly notify the Principal for investigation and the Principal will not ify appropriate law enforcement personnel, when appropriate. Weapons and Look -Alike Weapons Firearms and weapons are strictly prohibited on school property for all students, employees, volunteers, substitutes, interns and visitors. Possession of \"look- alike\" weapons on school property is considered and will be dealt with in the same manner as possession of actual weapons. Weapons include, but are not limited to, guns and knives of any kind, razors, metal knuckles, martial arts weapons, and explosi ve devices. Penalties for the possession of weapons or \"look- alikes\" are outlined in the Student Code of Conduct. Any student who suspects that another student is in possession of a firearm, weapon, or \"look- alike\" weapon on school property should report s uch information immediately to ASD personnel. Any ASD personnel to whom such information has been reported must promptly notify the Principal for investigation and the Principal will notify appropriate law enforcement personnel, when appropriate. 50 Law Enfo rcement/DHS Interviews of Students When (1) a law enforcement officer, (2) an investigator of the Crimes Against Children Division of the Department of Arkansas State Police, (3) an investigator or employees of the Department of Human Services requests to interview a student during school hours, ASD officials will record the appropriate personal identification from the police/investigator needing to interview the student. The principal or the principal's designee will then yield to the police officer /inve stigator regarding notifying the parent, guardian, custodian or person standing in loco parentis. If the interview relates to an investigation of the student's parent/guardian(s) notification will not be placed by school officials. If not the subject of the investigation and law enforcement/investigators concede to parent or guardian notification, ASD officials will make every effort possible to call the parent or aid the police/investigators in contacting the parent, guardian, custodian or person standing in loco parentis. At this point, parents may be given the opportunity to come to the school before the interview begins. All reasonable measures should be taken to avoid embarrassing the student and disrupting the educational program of the student and the school. The interview should be conducted in a private room removed from observation by other students and school personnel. A student may be questioned by the police, but he/she is not obliged to answer questions which might incriminate him/her. The principal or the principals' designee shall not provide notification if a request is made to interview a student during the course of an investigation of suspected child maltreatment and a parent, guardian custodian or person standing in loco parentis is named as an alleged offender. This shall apply to: (1) a law enforcement officer, (2) an investigator of the Crimes against Children Division of the Department of Arkansas State Police, (3) an investigator or employees of the Department of Human Servic es. In addition, if a student is under investigation as result of a call to the child maltreatment hotline, ASD does not have to notify the student's parent, guardian, custodian or person standing in loco parentis. ASD staff will yield the parental notification to: (1) a law enforcement officer, (2) an investigator of the Crimes against Children Division of the Department of Arkansas State Police, (3) an investigator or employees of the Department of Human Services. INTERNET SAFETY and ELECTRONIC DEVICE USE School Computer Use Policy A school computer account at ASD gives the user access via the school computer system to the school's academic software and the Internet. A computer account is a privilege, not a right. If a user abuses the privileges, account access could be revoked. A n ASD computer account is maintained by responsible behavior on the part of the account holder and complying with ASD computer usage policies. Just because a particular activity is not expressly prohibited by the computer usage policy does not mean that it is permissible for the user to engage in it. If you are unsure whether an activity is allowed or not, contact the Technology Coordinator. Technology Protection Measures ASD makes computers and/or internet access available to students, to perform resear ch and to allow students to learn how to use computer technology. Use of District computers is for educational and/or instructional purposes only. It is the policy of this District to equip each computer with internet filtering software designed to preve nt users from accessing material that is harmful to minors. For the purpose of this policy \"harm to minors\" is defined as any picture, image, graphic image file, or other visual depiction that (A) taken as a whole and with respect to minors, appeals to a prurient interest in nudity, sex, or excretion; (B) depicts, describes, or represents, in a patently offensive way with respect to what is suitable for minors, an actual or simulated sexual act or sexual contact, actual or simulated normal or perverted sex ual acts, or lewd exhibition of the genitals, and; C) taken as a whole, lacks serious literary, artistic, political, or scientific value as to minors. No student will be granted internet access until and unless a computer -use agreement, signed by both the student and the parent or legal guardian (if the student is under the age of eighteen [18]) is on file. 51 Congress recently passed the Children's Internet Protection Act (CIPA) which requires schools and public libraries that take certain federal funds to equip all computers that might be used by students with a system to block sites that are obscene or show material harmful to minors. The state of Arkansas has also passed legislation requiring school districts to provide Acceptable Use Policies and to provi de Internet filtering. The Arkansas School for the Deaf receives Internet access from the Arkansas Public School Computer Network (APSCN), which also provides filtering. Internet Use and Safety The District is dedicated to ensuring that students are capable of using the Internet in a safe and responsible manner. The District uses technology protection measures to aid in student safety and shall also educate students on appropriate online behavior and Internet use including, but not limited to: Interacting with other individuals on social networking websites and in chat rooms; Cyberbullying awareness; and Cyberbullying response. Students are advised that they cannot expect privacy in any aspect of their computer use, including email, and that monitoring o f student computer use is continuous. Through the generosity of Silent Sunday, combined with careful resource planning, the Arkansas School for the Deaf is fortunate to enjoy some of the best technology of any school in the state. ASD is committed to using this readily available technology to promote educational excellence by facilitating resource sharing, innovation, and communication. Website Privacy ASD operates and maintains a web site for the purpose of informing the citizens of the district about its activities. Any data collected is used to monitor the site activity and to improve the usefulness of the site to its visitors. The site serves no commercial purpose and does not collect any information from individuals for such purpose. Photogra phs of students shall not be displayed on any page of the district's web site without the prior written consent of the parent (or the student if 18 or older). The student's name may be used in conjunction with the photo or video clip. It is understood, however, that once the photo or video clip is displayed on a web site, the District has no control over how the photo or clip is used or misused by persons with computers accessing the District's web site. A Photo Release is included in the school enrollme nt form. The site provides for email communication between the District and individuals for the purpose of exchanging information regarding the District and its activities or between teachers and their students. The site may also provide for password protected communication between the District and its staff. Controversial Material Users may encounter material that is controversial and which users, parents, teachers, or administrators may consider inappropriate or offensive. However, on the I nternet it is impossible to control the content of data. Warranties The Arkansas School for the Deaf makes no warranties of any kind, whether expressed or implied, for the service it is providing. ASD will not be responsible for any damages a user suffers . This includes loss of data resulting from delays, non- deliveries, or service interruptions. ASD assumes no responsibility for the accuracy or quality of information obtained through its services. All users need to consider the source of any information they obtain and consider how valid that information may be. 52 Acceptable Computer Use Each user is expected to use accounts responsibly with purposes for which such accounts are granted. Activities beyond these stated purposes are strictly prohibited and m ay result in restricted or revoked access to computer resources. Misuse of Internet ASD policy and guidelines are posted on the network and are available for review at any time by all users. Logging in to the network implies consent to abide by ASD's Internet Use Policy. ASD administrators reserve the right to change and update the policy at any time. The opportunity to use the district's technology to access the Internet is a privilege and not a right. Students who misuse electronic devices or Intern et access in any way will face disciplinary action. The list below does not cover every situation that pertains to improper use of the computer resources at ASD, but it does suggest some of the responsibilities that the user accepts if he/she chooses to us e an ASD computer. Plagiarizing another student's assignment or plagiarizing by downloading from the internet are subject to academic penalties, up to and including loss of course credit and loss of computer use privileges; Accessing, copying, or destroyin g, programs or files that belong to other users or to ASD without prior authorization; Disclosing, using, or disseminating passwords, whether the passwords are the student's own or those of another student/faculty/community member, to other students; Insta lling software or changing the configuration on computers. (Purchase of software must be approved, and should only be installed by ASD's Network Administrator or Technology Coordinator.); Revealing personal address or phone numbers of other students or employees; Violating the rights of privacy of students and employees; Downloading or using profanity, obscenity or other language which may be offensive to another user; Subverting restrictions associated with student accounts; Using electronic devices to vio late any other policy or is contrary to the Internet Use Agreement; Using the network illegally in ways that violate federal, state, or local laws or statutes including electronic device hacking and copyright or intellectual property law violations; Using the network for financial gain or for any commercial or illegal activity; Using the network to send or retrieve pornographic material, inappropriate text files, or files dangerous to the integrity of the network; Spreading computer viruses or in any way causing disruption of the network, such as sending large e-mail files, etc.; Sending unnecessary \"broadcast\" email messages to all ASD staff; Using for Product advertisement or political lobbying; Circumventing security measures on school or remote computers or networks; Attempting to gain access to another's resources, programs, or data; Falsifying one's identity; Purchasing goods and services; Misusing or vandalizing equipment; Communicating credit card numbers, bank account numbers, or other financial information; Posting anonymous messages; Violating copyright restrictions (which are the same as for printed materials); Using the device to take photographs in locker rooms or bathrooms; Creating, sending, sharing, viewing, receiving, or possessing a n indecent visual depiction of oneself or another person ; The opportunity to use the district's technology to access the Internet is a privilege and not a right. Students who misuse electronic devices or Internet access in any way will face disciplinary action. 53 Social Media Guidelines Students should not be using social media during class time, unless it directly connects to the instruction and have been given permission from the classroom teacher. Be aware of what you post online. Social media venues, in cluding wikis, blogs, photo and video sharing sites, are very public. Do not post anything you wouldn't want friends, enemies, parents, teachers, or a future employer to see. Follow the school's code of conduct when writing online. It is acceptable to dis agree with someone else's opinions; however, do it in a respectful way. Make sure that criticism is constructive and not hurtful. What is inappropriate in the classroom is inappropriate online. Be safe online. Never give out personal information, including, but not limited to, last names, phone numbers, addresses, birthdates, and pictures. Do not share your password with anyone besides your teachers and parents. Linking to other websites to support your thoughts and ideas is recommended. However, be sure to read the entire article prior to linking to ensure that all information is appropriate for a school setting. Be aware that pictures may also be protected under copyright laws. Verify you have permission to use the image or it is under Creative Commons attribution. How you represent yourself online is an extension of yourself. Do not misrepresent yourself by using someone else's identity. Blog and wiki posts should be well written. Follow writing conventions including proper grammar, capitalizat ion, and punctuation. If you edit someone else's work, be sure it is in the spirit of improving the writing. If you run across inappropriate material that makes you feel uncomfortable or is not respectful, tell your teacher immediately. Students who do not abide by these terms and conditions will be subject to strict supervision during the use of any computers while on campus. Possession and Use of Cell Phones and Other Electronic Devices Arkansas School for the Deaf policy allows t he possession of telecommunications devices by students on campus during the regular school day. Students may bring cell phones to school to use during unstructured times according to the following conditions and limitations: The use of cell phones or oth er electronic devices during class time is forbidden except as allowed by the teacher for instructional purposes. Engaging in any form of academic dishonesty, including cheating, giving or receiving help during an examination, plagiarizing, or obtaining copies of testing materials, shall be considered to be misuse and shall violate this policy. The use of cell phones or other electronic devices to photograph or video oneself or other persons is forbidden. The classroom teacher may make an exception to t his policy if the photographs or videos are being made by students for instructional purposes after specific permission is granted, and if the photographs or video are taken under the supervision of the classroom teacher. Face Time and other live video com munication should not be used in areas where privacy is a major concern, such as bathrooms and the nurses' stations. A cell phone or other electronic device will be considered to be in use if it is visible at a time when usage has not been authorized by the classroom teacher. Use of an electronic device is permitted to the extent it is approved in a student's individualized education program (IEP), or if the device is needed and used in an emergency that threatens the immediate safety or security of stu dents, staff or other individuals. 54 Cell phones or other electronic devices which are used in violation of this policy will be confiscated by an appropriate administrator . When a students' phone is confiscated, the parents will be notified immediately. Confiscated cell phones and other electronic devices may be picked up at the administrative office. ASD bears no responsibility for lost/stolen electronic devices brought to school by a student. 55 CONDUCT AND DISCIPLINE Student Discipline Policy The ASD Board has a responsibility to protect the health, safety, and welfare of the District's students and employees. To help maintain a safe environment conducive to high student achievement, the Board establishes policies necessary to regulate student behavior to promote an orderly school environment that is respectful of the rights of others and ensures the fair enforcement of student discipline. Student Conduct Applies to: School activities on ASD property Travel on school buses and at bus stop Schoo l-sponsored activities Incidents which occur on the way to school or from school. Criminal offenses or other serious offenses committed away from school, but which may affect the school climate (This code applies to these kinds of offenses regardless of wh ether or not a student has been convicted in a court of law.) . ASD's administrators may also take disciplinary action against a student for off -campus conduct occurring at any time that would have a detrimental impact on school discipline, the educational environment, or the welfare of the students and/or staff. A student who has committed a criminal act while off campus and whose presence on campus could cause a substantial disruption to school or endanger the welfare of other students or staff is subject to disciplinary action up to and including expulsion. Such acts could include, but are not limited to , a felony or an act that would be considered a felony if committed by an adult, an assault or battery, drug law violations, or sexual miscondu ct of a serious nature. Any disciplinary action pursued by the district shall be in accordance with the student's appropriate due process rights. The handbook committee shall review the student discipline policies annually and may recommend changes in the policies to the Board. The Board has the responsibility of determining whether to approve any recommended changes to student discipline policies. Felony violations of Arkansas law and some serious misdemeanor violations are best handled through law enforcement agencies that consult with the Prosecutor's Office. This ensures that the student- violator is correctly referred to either the juvenile justice system or the adult criminal justice system for correction, treatment, or punishment for the student's behavior. It is an administrative responsibility to enact these procedures. ASD student discipline policies shall be distributed to each student during the first week of school each year and to new students upon their enrollment. Each student's parent or legal guardian shall sign a statement that they have received a student handbook which contains the Student Discipline Policy Each ASD staff member is responsible for the monitoring of conduct of all students. The principal, or person in charge, shall r eport to the police any incidents where a person has committed or threatened to commit , an act of violence or any crime involving a deadly weapon on school property or while under school supervision. Minimum and Maximum Consequences The minimum penalty for student offenses will be a verbal warning and the maximum penalty will be expulsion and/or legal action dependent upon the severity and frequency of the misconduct. 56 Possible Consequences for Breaking Rules Failure to follow school rules while on schoo l property, including buses, at school -s ponsored events, or on the way to and from school, may result in disciplinary action ranging from a minimum of reprimand to a maximum of expulsion and possible prosecution. The Arkansas School for the Deaf Board of T rustees has approved the following actions to be used by school personnel in dealing with students who break school rules: R eprimand ( warning) Time out Conference with student Detention Loss of privileges Restitution ( apology, community service, Student takes ownership of repairing relationships) Sent home (not suspended but sent home for a cool down period) I n -s chool suspension/ in-dorm suspension O ut of school suspension (exclusion from school 1 -10 d ays) E xpulsion (ASD may refer the student back to their school district for the entire school year or permanently) Parent contact/conference Referral to School Counselor/School Based Mental Health Therapist Referral for prosecution under municipal, state and federal laws that apply to the behavior. When minor offenses occur, staff will decide the type of disciplinary action to be used as a positive means of correcting unacceptable behavior. Major offenses may receive a recommendation for more intensive action. Major offenses that are defined under city and state law as criminal in nature may result in suspension or expulsion. The rules and regulations apply to all children at ASD with the exception of some students who have special considerations and/or accommodations. In-School -Suspension (ISS) The A rkansas School for the Deaf In -School -Suspension (ISS) Program is designed to provide continued opportunities for students who have been suspended from class or school to remain in school when the Principal/teacher, due to disciplinary problems, has recomm ended these students to the program. The final decision for placement in the ISS Program will be that of the Principal or Principal's designee. Suspension can be from an individual class or from the Dormitory/academic/vocational program. The intent of the ISS Program is to keep students with disciplinary problems in school. The ISS Program is an in -school disciplinary system. Any additional incidents that occur during the time a student is in the ISS Program may result in suspension off campus. The day of ISS should be used constructively to help improve behavior while keeping up with academic work. Students scheduled for Speech, OT, PT, will be permitted to receive these services. The therapist will administer these services in the designated ISS room. Rules for ISS : Students will report to the ISS room when entering the building at 7:55 a.m. Students must have all books, pencils, and other materials needed to complete assignments. Students will not be permitted to leave the ISS room, except for bathroom requests. Assigned schoolwork will be done on an individual basis. Students may not communicate with each other. Students will not be permitted to sleep. Students may not leave their seats. Students will be given a lunch from the cafeteria that will be eaten in the ISS room. 57 Students who do not complete the class work assigned for ISS can be assigned additional time for ISS. Students are not to have contact with other students while in ISS. Students serving ISS will NOT BE PERMITTED TO PARTICIPATE IN ANY AFTER SCHOOL ACTIVITIES ON THAT DAY. (Dorm students will be restricted to dorm.) Day students must leave school at the end of the day. ISS Program Implementation The student's Individual Education Program (IEP) will continue to be implemented during his/her time in the ISS Program. It is the responsibility of the student's classroom teachers to provide all materials (worksheets, handouts, tests, etc.) to the ISS Program Coordinator for implementation. It will be the responsibility o f the ISS Program Coordinator, Teachers and Teacher Aide to implement these activities and ensure daily assignments are completed. At the end of the school day all materials completed will be collected and given to the Coordinator.

Out-of-School Suspension In extreme cases, it may be necessary to dismiss a student from school for a period not exceeding ten (10) school days. During suspension the student is not permitted to be present on the ASD campus, or attend or participate in any ASD sponsored activities. Suspended students are not permitted on campus at any time except for reinstatement conference that parents attend. Expelled students are not pe rmitted on campus at any time. Expulsion ASD may expel a student for a period longer than ten (10) school days for violation of the School's written discipline policies and for conduct deemed to be of such gravity that suspension would be inappropriate, o r where the student's continued attendance at school would disrupt the orderly learning environment or would pose an unreasonable danger to the welfare of other students or staff. Emergency Removal from Class A building administrator may remove a student without parent notification and/or conference if it is determined that the student's continued presence poses an immediate danger to persons or property or may substantially disrupt the school's orderly operation. Whenever a student is removed under these conditions, a parent/guardian(s) will be notified as soon as possible. The student will not be allowed to participate in any school -r elated activity while on emergency removal. Parent/Guardian(s) Notification of Suspension/Send Home Before the student is sent home, school officials will make every reasonable effort to notify the parent/guardian(s) of a suspension and the reasons for the action. The parent/guardian(s) will be informed that the student's suspension includes a loss of opportunity to pa rticipate in any school -r elated activity. The student is also prohibited from entering any ASD property without prior authorization of the principal or designee. Prior to the student's return to classes, the parent and student must attend a separate prog ramming conference in person. The Principal or designee can allow a separate programming conference via phone if deemed appropriate. \"Send Home\" (Cool Down Period) A \"send home\" is used to establish contact with a parent/guardian(s) to resolve problems that do not require suspension.

Students and parents should be familiar with the standards set out in the Student Code of Conduct, included in the handbook, as well as campus, classroom and residential rules. A student's IEP committee may design and adopt an individual behavior program for the student addressing a variety of target behaviors. The behavior program may include the use of physical intervention to respond to targeted behaviors by trained staff members. MINOR DISCIPLINARY ACTIONS Minor offenses will be addressed by ASD staff prior to referral to the building administrator s. The building administrator(s) and/or staff will make an effort to address minor violations with effective, positive alternative interventions different from a punitive disciplinary reaction. The goal will be to recommend disciplinary actions that provide opportunity to address or resolv e minor disciplinary challenges in a positive manner. Ensuring a safe, orderly teaching and learning environment is priority when addressing and resolving minor behavioral issues. The building administrator may choose a more severe penalty at any time based on the student's past disciplinary record or may reduce disciplinary sanctions when warranted.

A caretaker is anyone w ho is age 10 or older that's entrusted with the child's care and well- being. Child maltreatment occurs when the responsible person harms the child, lets the child come to harm in some way, or in some way does not meet the child's basic needs. Under Arkan sas law, anyone who suspects that child abuse or child maltreatment is occurring has the duty to report it to proper authorities. Social workers, doctors, teachers and school counselors are required by law to report any suspicions they have of child maltreatment. Reports can be made by phone via a phone number (1 -800- 482-5964) or via internet at http://www.arkansas.gov/reportARchildabuse/. Notifying local or state law enforcement does not satisfy the duty to report; only notification by means of the Hotline discharges this duty. Failure to report suspected child abuse, maltreatment or neglect by calling the Hotline can lead to criminal prosecution and individual civil liability of the person who has this duty. The duty to report suspected child abuse or maltreatment is a direct and personal duty, and cannot be assigned or delegated to another person. There is no duty to investigate, confirm or substantiate statements a student may have made which form the basis of the reasonable cause to believe that t he student may have been abused or subjected to maltreatment by another person; however, a person with a duty to report may find it helpful to make a limited inquiry to assist in the formation of a belief that child abuse, maltreatment or neglect has occurred, or to rule out such a belief. Employees and volunteers who call the Child Abuse Hotline in good faith are immune from civil liability and criminal prosecution. All reports of child maltreatment, by Arkansas law, must be investigated. If the report is found to be wrong then no further action will be taken. It child maltreatment is occurring, the Division of Child and Family Services will attempt to make sure your children are protected and their basic needs met. If maltreatment continues, the courts will decide what legal action is appropriate. By law, no school district or school district employee or volunteer may prohibit or restrict an employee from directly reporting child abuse or maltreatment, or require that any person notify or seek permission from any person before making a report to the Child Abuse Hotline. Child Abuse Hotline Arkansas Law ACA 12 -15-507 requires reports made to the Child Abuse Hotline if a person has a reasonable cause to suspect that a child has been abused or neglected.

Childhood obesity increases the incidence of adult diseases occurring in children and adolescents such as heart disease, high blood pressure and diabetes. The increased risk carries forward into their adulthood. Research indicates that a healthy diet and regular physical activity can help prevent obesity and the diseases resulting from it. It is understood that the eating habits and exercise patterns of students cannot be changed overnight, but at the same time, the Board of Directors believes it is necessary to strive to create a culture in our schools that consistently promotes good nutrition and physical activity. The problem of obesity and inactivity is a public health issue. The Board of Trustees is keenly aware that it has taken years for t his problem to reach its present level and will similarly take years to correct. The responsibility for addressing the problem lies not only with the schools and the Arkansas Department of Education, but with the community and its residents, organizations and agencies. Therefore, the District shall enlist the support of the larger community to find solutions which improve the health and physical activity of our students. 67 Goals In its efforts to improve the school nutrition environment, promote student health, and reduce childhood obesity, the District will adhere to the Arkansas Rules Governing Nutrition and Physical Activity Standards in Arkansas Public Schools. To promote nutrition, physical activity, and other school based activities that will improve stu dent wellness, the District has established the following goals. Appoint a district school health coordinator (designated district official) who shall be responsible for ensuring that each school fulfills the requirements of this policy; Implement a grade appropriate nutrition education program that will develop an awareness of and appreciation for nutrition and physical activity throughout the curriculum; Enforce existing physical education requirements and engage students in healthy levels of vigorous physical activity; Strive to improve the quality of physical education curricula and increase the training of physical education teachers; Follow the Arkansas Physical Education and Health Education Frameworks in grades K -12; Not use food or beverages a s rewards for academic, classroom, or sports performances; Ensure that drinking water is available without charge to all students; Establish class schedules and bus routes that do not directly or indirectly restrict meal access; Provide students with ample time to eat their meals in pleasant cafeteria and dining areas; Establish no more than nine (9) school wide events which permit exceptions to the food and beverage limitations established by Rule. The schedule of the events shall be by school, approved by the principal, and shall be part of the annual school calendar; Abide by the current allowable food and beverage portion standards; Meet or exceed the more stringent of Arkansas' or the U.S. Department of Agriculture's Nutrition Standards for reimbursable meals and a la' carte foods served in the cafeteria; Restrict access to vended foods, competitive foods, and foods of minimal nutritional value (FMNV) as required by law and Rule; Conform new and/or renewed vending contracts to the content rest rictions contained in the Rules and reduce district dependence on profits from the sale of FMNV ; Provide professional development to all district staff on the topics of nutrition and/or physical activity; Utilize the School Health Index available from the Center for Disease Control (CDC) to assess how well the district is doing at implementing this wellness policy and at promoting a healthy environment for its students. Advisory Committee To enhance the district's efforts to improve the health of our students, a School Nutrition and Physical Activity Advisory Committee (SNPAAC) shall be formed. It shall be structured in a way that ensures age -appropriate recommendations are made which correlate to our district's grade configurations. The SNPAAC shall have the powers and responsibilities delegated to it by statute and Rule and are incorporated into this policy by reference. 7 The overarching goal of the committee shall be to promote student wellness by monitoring how well the district is doing at implementing this policy. The SNPAAC shall use modules 1, 2, 3, 4, and 8 of the CDC's School Health Index as a basis for assessing each school's progress toward meeting the requirements of this policy. The results of the annual assessment shall be included in each school's ACSIP, provided to each school's principal, and reported to the board. Goals and objectives for nutrition and physical activity shall also be included in the ACSIP. Parents, students, the District's teachers of physical education, school health profe ssionals, the District School Board of Directors, the District's school administrators, members of the community, and representatives of the District's school food authority shall be included in the development, implementation, and periodic review of the D istrict's wellness policy to the extent interested persons from each group desire to be included. 68 The SNPAAC shall provide recommendations to the school district concerning menus and other foods sold in the school cafeteria. Such recommendations shall be based, at least in part, on the information the Committee receives from the District on the requirements and standards of the National School Lunch Program and information and from menus for the National School Lunch Program and other food sold in the school cafeteria on a quarterly basis. The District shall periodically assess, with input from the SNPACC, the District and individual schools' status regarding implementing this policy. The assessment shall be based, at least in part, on: the extent to which District schools are in compliance with this policy; the extent to which this policy compares to other model local school wellness policies; and a description of the progress made in attaining the goals of this policy. The assessment results along w ith the content of this policy shall be periodically reported to the public, including parents, students, and other members of the community. COUNSELING Academic/Transition Counseling Students and their parents are encouraged to talk with the transition/career counselor, teacher, or Principal to learn more about course offerings, graduation requirements, and early graduation procedures. Each year, high school students will be provided information on anticipated course offerings for the next school year and other information that will help them make the most of academic and CTE opportunities as well as information on the importance of postsecondary education. The career counselor can also provide information about entrance exams and application deadlines, as well as information about automatic admission, financial aid, housing, and scholarships as these relate to state colleges and universities. The career counselor can also provide information about workface opportunities after graduation or tech nical and trade school opportunities, including opportunities to earn industry- recognized certificates and licenses. School Counseling Every student is allowed to see the school counselor who is available to support the student with social and emotional concerns. The school counselor may provide the student and/or family with information about community resources. Counselors may engage students in a variety of classroom and dormitory counseling topics related to positive self- esteem, personal safety, and social skills. A student who wishes to meet with the school counselor should request an appointment with the counselor. Any parent, teacher, or dorm staff may refer a student to the school counselor by calling or stopping by to talk about their concerns of questions. All visits are kept confidential unless there is information received that may cause the counselor to suspect that the student has been abused, may harm themselves, or is of danger to others, The counselor will then contact the appropriate authorities or agencies necessary to assist with the situation. School Based Mental Health Services School based mental health is the provision of therapeutic interventions and preventions for students and their families within the school setting with the purpose of equipping children for academic and social success. Currently therapeutic services and support are provided to ASD students and families by an outside community mental health agency. Your child may be referred for SBMH intervention by a school counselor. Services may also be initiated by parent request. Students will not participate in SBMH without a parent's consent. 69 Mental Health Issues Requiring Interventions Self-harm/Self- injury Self-injury is defined as the intentional, direct injuring of body tissue most often done without suicidal intentions. The most common form of self- harm is skin -cutting but self -harm also covers a wide range of behaviors including, but not limited to, burning, scratching, banging or hitting body parts, interfering with wound healing (dermatillomania ), hair -pulling ( trichotillomania ), and the ingestion of toxic substances or objects. If a staff member has knowledge of a student engaging in self -injurious behaviors the staff member should contact the School Counselor, the Principal/Dean, and/or the School Nurse immediately regardless of the time. The staff member is to stay with the student until the counselors are reached. A s a parent, if you become aware of your child engaging in self har m you are encouraged to contact the school counselor or Principal/Dean. Suicidal Ideation and Suicidal Behavior Suicidal ideation concerns thoughts about or an unusual preoccupation with suicide. The range of suicidal ideation varies greatly from fleeting thoughts, to extensive thou ghts, to detailed planning. Suicidal behavior is any action that could cause a person to die, such as taking a drug overdose or placing a noose around ones neck. If a staff member sees a student attempting to kill him or herself they are to call 911 immediately. If a student expresses suicidal ideation the staff member should contact the School Counselor, the Principal/Dean, and/or the School Nurse immediately regardless of time. The staff member should remain with the student until the counselors arrive or prov ide guidance to the situation As a parent, if you become aware of your child struggling with suicidal ideation and/or suicidal behavior you need to seek help immediately. You may contact the school counselor or the SBMH Therapist for guidance. Homicidal I deation Homicidal ideation is a common medical term for thoughts about homicide. There is a range of homicidal thoughts which spans from vague ideas of revenge to detailed and fully formulated plans without the act itself. If a staff member has knowledge of a student engaging homicidal ideation the staff member should contact the School Counselor, the Principal/Dean, and/or the School Nurse immediately regardless of the time. In accord with common health care practice, the SBMH Therapist may conduct an initial assessment and intervention of possible mental health emergencies even if there is no parental consent on record. The staff member is to stay with the student until the counselors are reached. As a parent, if you become aware of your child struggling with homicidal ideation you need to seek help immediately. You may contact the school counselor for guidance. Mental Health Emergencies A mental health emergency is a situation, in which any student who is making statements or behaving in a manner that in the staff's observation (or report by others) can be interpreted as being either a danger to self or a danger to others. Imminent risk includes, but is not limited to, suicidal ideation or actions, homicidal threats/attempts, suspicion of drug ingestion, or fleeing designated areas. ASD defines a mental health crisis as a behavioral, emotional, or psychiatric situation which would likely result in significantly reduced levels of functioning in primary activities of daily living. Mental Health Emergencie s require a mental health assessment which may result in the placement of the student in a more restrictive setting, including but not limited to, inpatient hospitalization. If a mental health emergency occurs, a staff member should contact the School Counselor, the Principal/Dean, and/or the School Nurse. Procedure ASD staff member will contact 911 if the student or others are in immediate danger. If 911 does not need to be called, the ASD staff member will attempt to supportively calm the student in cri sis while contacting or getting help 70 from someone to contact the school counselor and/or Principal/Dean. In accord with common health care practice, the SBMH Therapist may conduct an initial assessment and intervention of possible mental health emergencie s even if there is no parental consent on record. The School Counselor, the Principal/Dean, and/or the School Nurse will assess the level of risk to the student or others and develop a plan according to school policies. The plan may include the following: Removal of other students from the area of the crisis if appropriate Possible medical treatment/psychiatric treatment A mobile Assessment may be called to come on campus and conduct an evaluation of the student. If a mobile assessment is not able to come to campus the student may need to be transported to a medical facility for an evaluation. If a student is admitted into a behavioral hospital, upon discharge with a written note from doctor to ensure that student is safe to return to school, a Separat e Programming Conference is required for the student to return to school. In addition, all discharge paperwork and medication orders need to be given to the school to ensure appropriate programming. Plan for T ransportation if N ecessary: The student may be transported to a medical facility/hospital emergency room via ambulance, police or ASD staff member in a state vehicle. Parent or guardian will be notified, unless it puts the student in increased danger. School building administrator or Dorm Supervisors will be notified. HEALTH SERVICES The philosophy of Health Services is to help the individual student restore and maintain optimum health. We define health as a state of complete physical, mental and social well - being. We believe that eac h student's medical needs should be recognized and met in ways that are appropriate for his/her individual situation. Each student should be taught a sense of responsibility for his/her own health needs and principles upon which good health is based. We believe good health and good health practices are conducive to obtaining a quality education. Location, Hours, and Contact Information For Health Services location and availability, see website . Policy and Procedure Students must have a permission slip fro m the school office or dormitory office before they can see the nurse. Any student who is seen by the Health Services staff can be admitted to one of the observation rooms.

Communicable Diseases and Parasites In order to safeguard the school community from the spread of certain communicable diseases the Arkansas School for the Deaf will adhere to the Arkansas Department of Health policies and procedures relating to the prevention of and response to infectious/ communicable diseases. Students are not allowed to attend school during the period of communicability as established by the Arkansas Department of Health. The student's return to school is determined by the Health Department Guidelines or writt en statement from the physician. The staff has a responsibility to advise Health Services when a student is suspected of having a communicable disease. The Health Services supervisor will annually review with the staff the procedures to be used for handli ng a student who is suspected of having a communicable disease. The superintendent at the direction of the Arkansas Department of Health has the final responsibility for exclusion from school of a student with a communicable disease. Student health inform ation is confidential. However, in connection with an emergency, personal identifiable information from a student's health record may be disclosed to appropriate parties to protect the health and safety of the student or other individuals. Students with communicable diseases or with human host parasites that are transmittable in a school environment shall demonstrate respect for other students by not attending school while they are capable of transmitting their condition to others. Students whom the school nurse determines are unwell or unfit for school attendance or who are believed to have a communicable disease or condition will be required to be picked up by their parent or guardian. Specific examples include, but are not limited to: lice, chicken pox, measles, scabies, conjunctivitis infections, ringworm, mononucleosis, Hepatitis A, B, or C, mumps, vomiting, diarrhea, and fever (100.0 F when taken o rally). A 72 student who has been sent home by the school nurse will be subsequently readmitted, at the discretion of the school nurse, when the student is no longer a transmission risk. In some instances, a letter from a health care provider may be required prior to the student being readmitted to the school. To help control the possible spread of communicable diseases, school personnel shall follow the District's exposure control plan when dealing with any blood borne, foodborne, and airborne pathogens expos ures. Standard precautions shall be followed relating to the handling, disposal, and cleanup of blood and other potentially infectious materials such as all body fluids, secretions and excretions (except sweat). The District shall maintain a copy of each s tudent's immunization record. A student with an exemption from immunization must have an exemption from the Arkansas Department of Health on file annually. A list of individuals with exemptions from immunization shall be education records. An education record may be disclosed to appropriate parties in connection with an emergency if knowledge of the information is necessary to protect the health or safety of the student or other individuals. A student enrolled in the District who has an immunization exemption may be removed from school at the discretion of the Arkansas Department of Health during an outbreak of the disease for which the student is not vaccinated. The student may not return to the school until the outbreak has been resolved and the student' s return to school is approved by the Arkansas Department of Health. The parents or legal guardians of students found to have live human host parasites that are transmittable in a school environment will be asked to pick their child up at the end of the school day. The parents or legal guardians will be given information concerning the eradication and control of human host parasites. A student may be readmitted after the school nurse or designee has determined the student no longer has live human host paras ites that are transmittable in a school environment. Each school may conduct screenings of students for human host parasites that are transmittable in a school environment as needed. The screenings shall be conducted in a manner that respects the privacy a nd confidentiality of each student. Student Illness/Accident If a student becomes too ill to remain in class and/or could be contagious to other students, the school nurse or designee will attempt to notify the student's parent or legal guardian. The stude nt will remain in health services or a place where he/she can be supervised until the parent/legal guardian can check the student out of school. If a student becomes seriously ill or is injured while at school and the parent/legal guardian cannot be contac ted, the failure to make such contact shall not unreasonably delay the school's expeditious transport of the student to an appropriate medical care facility. The school assumes no responsibility for treatment of the student. When available, current, and ap plicable, the student's emergency contact numbers and medical information will be utilized. Parents are strongly encouraged to keep this information up to date. Physical Examinations or Screenings The district conducts routine health screenings such as hea ring, vision, BMI and scoliosis due to the importance these health factors play in the ability of a student to succeed in school. The intent of the exams or screenings is to detect defects in hearing, vision, or other elements of health that would adversely affect the student's ability to achieve to his/her full potential. Screenings Please consider the above annual health evaluation screening information to be your BMI and scoliosis screening. Scoliosis screening takes place in February for girls in 6th grade and boys and girls in 8th grade. If you do not want your child to participate in the BMI or scoliosis screenings, a written statement from you is required. Please send the statement to Health Services staff before screening begins. 73 The rights provid ed to parents under this policy transfer to the student when he/she turns 18 years old. Except in instances where a student is suspected of having a contagious or infectious disease, parents shall have the right to opt their student out of the physical exams or screenings by providing certification from a physician that he/she has recently examined the student Medication Prior to the administration of any medication, including any dietary supplement not regulated by the US Food and Drug Administration, to a ny student under the age of eighteen (18), written parental consent is required. The consent form shall include authorization to administer the medication and relieve the Board and its employees of civil liability for damages or injuries resulting from the administration of medication to students in accordance with this policy. All signed medication consent forms are to be maintained by Health Services. A parent sending medication for a residential student must give the medication to the charter bus or van chaperone who will give it to a dorm staff member or the nurse upon arrival at school. Unless authorized to self -administer or otherwise authorized by this policy, students are not a llowed to carry any medications - including over -the-counter (OTC) medicati ons, any dietary supplement , or other perceived health remedy not regulated by the US Food and Drug Administration -while at school , in the dormitory, or in their possession at any time. Medications, including those for self- administration, must be in the original container and be properly labeled with the student's name, the ordering provider's name, the name of the medication, the dosage, frequency, and instructions for the administration of the medication (including times). Additional information accompanying the medication shall state the purpose for the medication, its possible side effects, and any other pertinent instructions (such as special storage requirements) or warnings. Schedule II medications that are permitted by this policy to be brought to school shall be stored in a double locked cabinet. Medication in a plastic bag or an outdated prescription bottle, will not be accepted. Written parental/guardian permission to give the medication and written doctor's orders must be provided. The district's supervising registered nurse is responsible for creating procedures for the administration of medications on and off campus. When medication is brought to the school nurse, the nurse shall document, the quantity of the medication. The school nurse shall ask another school employee to verify the quantity of the medication(s). Each person present shall sign a form verifying the quantity of the medication(s).

A student is prohibited from sharing, transferring, or in any way diverting his/her medications to any other person. The fact that a student with a completed consent form on file is allowed to carry a rescue inhaler, auto -injectable epinephrine, diabetes medication, or combination does not require him/her to have such on his/her person. The parent or guardian of a student who qualifies under this policy to self -carry a rescue inhaler, auto -injectable epinephrine, diabetes medication, or any combination on his/her person shall provide the school with the appropriate medication, which shall be immediately available to the student in an emergency.

Fo r children under age 12 years, admission is given if the child's IEP/IFSP team determines that their educational needs require ASD's residential environment. Students ages 3 & 4 years old may be accepted if they have developed age -appropriate self -help and behavioral skills. In the case of students who do not have age -appropriate self -help and behavioral skills, they may be accepted with 1:1 assistance supported by an outside entity. All students entering the residential program will have a 30 day tran sitioning period to assess how the student is acclimating to the environment. If the school determines that the child is not thriving in the residential environment, the school may request a meeting with the parent/guardian to discuss an action plan or whether the student's needs are best met in the residential environment. The Student Life staff is responsible for the care and welfare of students whether the students are on campus or off campus after school until students go to classes in the morning and on the weekends if there are special events. The Student Life Office hours are 2:30pm to 8:00am . The Dorm Supervisors are available to assist parents/guardians and students during these hours . Residential Advisors (RA) offices are stationed at different residential halls, and their hours are varied to cover the 2:30pm to 8:00am time frame. Most RAs are available from 5:00pm to 11:00pm on Sunday and between 2:30pm to 11 :00pm Monday through Thursday. Overnight RAs can be contacted between 11:00pm -8:00am.
