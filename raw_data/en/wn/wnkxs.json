My goal is to work with your strengths and lend support where necessary. My foundation for East Asian medicine is in Acupuncture, Chinese Herbal Medicine and the techniques that accompany this form of treatment; cupping, gua sha, Tui Na, etc. From this, I have branched out into Traditional Swedish and Ayurvedic Abhyanga style massage, Ayurvedic medicine and panchakarma as well as sound healing, utilizing Nepalese Seven metal singing bowls and Acutonics; tuning forks. These different styles allow me to use just what is necessary in a session to offer you individualized care. I look forward to meeting you and helping you awaken your inner healer.
