The curriculum consists of rigorous science- and policy-based courses and experiential learning that prepare our students for exciting careers in the environmental field. The Department of Environmental Science recommits itself to advancing informed, knowledge-based approaches to confronting local and global environmental concerns. [](#collapse-5722974) Faculty Research Labs Jessica Gephart [](#collapse-6115290) Diversity, Equity and Inclusion All humans depend on the Earth for survival, creating a universal interest in understanding and protecting it. Solving complex environmental problems requires diverse perspectives and ways of knowing. Yet, most of the history of environmental science and allied fields has excluded and marginalized people based on their race, socioeconomic status, nationality, gender, sexual orientation, disability, and other characteristics. Moreover, environmental science has also caused harm through extractive research practices and research that has promoted harmful, and wrong, ideas towards marginalized people. In the AU Environmental Science Department, we recognize that environmental scientists, scholars and activists must be representative and inclusive of humanity in all its diversity. We also strive to confront the harmful history of our discipline, put science in the appropriate context, and avoid making the same mistakes again. People are drawn to our field of study for myriad reasons: love of the outdoors, passion for environmental justice, and an interest in solving complicated, interdisciplinary problems, to name a few. All these motivations are valid. Whatever has brought you here, it is our goal to create a welcoming space for you in our department, where you can flourish academically and personally. Here is an overview of what our department is doing to promote diversity and inclusion: - Supporting the [Underrepresented Students in STEM](https://www.facebook.com/groups/underrepresentedstudentsinstem/)and and [Women In Science](https://www.facebook.com/groups/100140873375084/)student groups at AU - Organizing a reading and discussion group to understand and combat racism in our field, based on the NSF-funded [Undoing Racism in the Geosciences](https://urgeoscience.medium.com/unlearning-racism-in-geoscience-1f40aa32216e)curriculum - Obtaining an Antiracist Curriculum Development Grant to enhance our curriculum - Helping develop and lead AU's new [Center for Environment, Community and Equity](/centers/CECE/index.cfm). ENVS Courses Additionally, many of our classes cover environmental justice topics. These include: AU Core Classes - ENVS 150: The Nature of Earth - Complex Problems classes: Pollution Solutions, Facing Climate Change, Maxing Out Planet Earth Majors' and Graduate Classes - ENVS 160: Biodiversity and Ecosystems - ENVS 220: Energy and - ENVS 260: Energy and Pollution - ENVS 324: Environmental Health - ENVS 470/670: Water Resources Our Community: Sustainability See some of the ways AU and CAS students and faculty pursue sustainability.
