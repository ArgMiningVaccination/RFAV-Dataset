Abdul Khaliq Controller of Examinations Telangana State Board of Intermediate Education Educational Research and Training Wing Ramana Rao Vudithyala Reader Vasundhara Devi Dist.Coordinating CommitteePREFACE The ongoing Global Pandemic Covid-19 that has engulfed the entire world has changed every sphere of our life. Education, of course is not an exception. In the absence of Physical Classroom Teaching, Department of Intermediate Education Telangana has successfully engaged the students and imparted education through TV lessons. The actual class room teaching through physical classes was made possible only from 1st February 2021. In the back drop of the unprecedented situation due to the pandemic TSBIE has reduced the burden of curriculum load by considering only 70% syllabus for class room instruction as well as for the forthcoming Intermediate Public Examinations May 2021. It has also increased the choice of questions in the examination pattern for the convenience of the students. To cope up with exam fear and stress and to prepare the students for annual exams in such a short span of time , TSBIE has prepared \"Basic Learning Material\" that serves as a primer for the students to face the examinations confidently. It must be noted here that, the Learning Material is not comprehensive and can never substitute the Textbook. At most it gives guidance as to how the students should include the essential steps in their answers and build upon them. I wish you to utilize the Basic Learning Material after you have thoroughly gone through the Text Book so that it may enable you to reinforce the concepts that you have learnt from the Textbook and Teachers. I appreciate ERTW Team, Subject Experts, who have involved day in and out to come out with the, Basic Learning Material in such a short span of time. I would appreciate the feedback from all the stake holders for enriching the learning material and making it cent percent error free in all aspects. The material can also be accessed through our website www.tsbie.cgg.gov.in . Commissioner & Secretary Intermediate Education, Telangana.Contents UNIT NO. TITLE PAGE NO.

Define vital capacity. What is its significance ? Ans:- Vital Capacity (V.C):- The maximum volume of air a person can breathe in after forced expiration this includes ERV, TV and IRV V.C.=TV+1RV+ERV 2. What is the volume of air remaining in Lungs after a normal expiration? Ans:- The volume of air that remains in the lungs after normal expiration is \"Functional Residual capacity (FRC). FRC = ERV+RV 3. Diffusion of oxygen occurs in the alveolar region only and not in the other parts of respiratory system. How do you justify the statement? Ans:- The diffusion membrane is made up of three major layers namely (1) The thin sqlamous epithelium of the alveolar wall (2) the endothelium of the alveolar capillaries and (3) the basement membrane in between them. As if is a very thin border. It is favourable for diffusion of gases. 4. What is the effect of PCo 2 on oxygen transport ? Ans:- The effect of PCo 2 on oxygen transport is called \"Bohr Effect\" 5. What happens to the respiratory process in a man going up a hill ? Ans:- At a height of about 6000m the Po 2 becomes almost half of what it is at the mean sea level hence the \"mountain sickness\" in people ascending hills. The ribcage and the diaphragm help mammals breath in air more effectively. 6. What is tidal volume ? Find out the tidal volume (Approximate Value) in a healthy human in an hour ? Ans:- Tidal Volume (T.V.) :- Volume of air inspired or expired during normal inspiration or expiration. It is apprximately 500ml i.e., a healthy man can inhale or exhale approximately 6000 to 8000ml of air per minute. So in an hour T.V. is 500x60=30000ml (or) 30LBasic Learning Material 2 7. Define oxyhaemoglobin dissociation curve ? Can you suggest any reason for its sigmoidal pattern ? Ans:- A sigmoid curve is obtained when percentage saturation of haemoglobin with O 2 is plotted against the Po 2. This curve is called oxyhaemoglobin dissociation curve. 8. What are Conchae ? Ans:- In Nasal chambers respiratory part has three thin twisted bony plates called conchae. 9. What is meant by chloride Ans:-Chloride Exchang of chloride and bicarbonate between erythrocytes and plasma. It is also called Hamburger's Phenomenon. 10. Mention any two occupational respiratory disorders and their causes in human beings? Ans:-1. Asbestosis:- It occurs due to charonic exposure to asbestos dust in the people working in asbestos industry. 2. Silicosis :- It occurs because of long term exposure to silica dust in the people working in mining industries, quarries e.t.c. 11. Name the muscles that help in normal breathing movements ? Ans:- The muscular diaphragm (phrenic muscles) and a specialized set of muscles, the external and internal intercostal muscles help in normal breathing movements. 12. Draw a diagram of oxyhaemoglobin dissociation curve ? Ans: Zoology-II 3 Short Answer type Questions 1. Explain the process of inspiration and expiration under normal conditions? Ans:-1. Inspiration :- In take of atmospheric air into the Lungs is called inspiration. It is an active process as it takes place by the contraction of the muscles of the diaphragm and the external inter costal muscles. which extend in between the ribs. 2. Expiration :- Release of alveolar air to the exterior is called expiration. It is a passive process. Relaxation of the diaphragm and the external inter costal muscles returns diapharagm and sternum to their normal position. 2. What are the major transport mechanisms for Co 2 Explain ? Ans:-As bicarbonates :- About 70 percent of Co 2 is transported as bicarbonates with the help of carbonic anhydrase enzyme. This enzyme facilitate the following reaction in both the directions. Carbonic anhydrase Carbonic anhydrase 32 2 2 2Co H O H CO Hco H At the tissues where partial pressure of Co 2 is high due to catabolism. Co 2 diffuses into the blood (RBC & Plasma) and forms carbonic acid which dissociates into and H+ , Hco- 3 At the alveolar site where PCo 2 is low, the reaction proceeds in the opposite direction leading to the formation of Co2 and water. Thus Co 2 is mostly trapped as bicorbonate at the tissues and transported to the alveoli where it is relesed out as Co 2. Chloride Shift :- Exchange of chloride and bicorbonate ions between erythrocytes and plasma is also called Hamburger's Phenomenon. 3. How is respiratory movements regulated in man? Ans:- (1) A special centre present in the medulla region of brain Called respi- ratory rhythm centre is primary responsible for regulation. (2) Another centre present in the pons of the brain stem called Pneumotoxic centre can moderate the functions of the respiratory rhythm centre. (3) A chemo-sensitive area is situated adjacent to the respiratory rhythm centre which is highly sensitive to Co 2 and H+ ions (4) Receptors associated with aortic arch and carotid artery also recog nize changes in Co2 and H+ concentration and send necessary signals to the respiratory rhythm centre for necessary actions. 4. Describe the disorders of Respiratory System ? Ans:Asthama :- is a difficulty in breathing caused due to inflammation of bronchi and bronchioles symptoms include coughing difficulty in breathing and wheezing.Basic Learning Material 4 Emphysema:- is a chronic disorder in which alveolar walls are damaged and their walls coalesce due to which respiratory surface are of exchange of gases is decreased one of the major causes of this smoking of tobacco. Bronchitis:- is the inflammation of the bronchi resulting in the swelling of mucous lining of bronchi increased mucus production and decreases in the diameter of bronchi Pneumonia :- is infection of lungs caused by bacteria such as streptococcus pneumoniae and also by certain viruses, fungi, Respiratory disorders:- \"Asbestosis\", \"Silicosis\" \"Siderosis\", \"Blacklung disease\" are caused by exposure of the body to the harmful substances from certain industries, especially those involving grinding or stone breaking. Long Answer type Questions 1. Describe the respiratory system in man ? Ans:- Respiratory system of man includes the following : I. External nostrils (External Nares) A pair of external nostrils opens out above the upper lip/They lead into nasal chambers through the nasal passages. II. Nasal Chambers They lie above the palate and are separated from each other by a nasal septum. Each nasal chamber can be differentiated into three parts namely; i. vestibular part (which has hair and sebaceous glands to prevent the entry of dust particles), ii. respiratory part (which is involved in the conditioning the temperature of inhaled air, it has three thin, twisted bony plates called turbinals /conchae) and iii.olfactory part (which is lined by an olfactory epithelium). III. Naso-pharynx Nasal chambers lead into nasopharynx through a pair of internal nostrils. located above the soft palate. Nasopharynx is a portion of the pharynx. IV. Larynx Larynx is a cartilaginous box which helps in sound production, hence called the voice box- Wall of larynx is supported by nine cartilages. Thyroid, the cuneiform cartilages are the paired cartilages. Epiglottis is a thin leaf like elastic cartilaginous flap attached to the thyroid cartilage to prevent the entry of food into theZoology-II 5 larynx through the glottis. The yellow elastic fibres which connect the thyroid and arytenoid cartilages are called vocal cords/vocal folds- The space between the true vocal cords and the arytenoids cartilage/ is called rima glottidis. The mid ventral part of the thyroid cartilage forms the laryngeal prominence called Adam's apple In males, the vocal cords are thicker, longer, and produce low pitch voice, where as in women and children the vocal cords are usually short and produce high pitch voice. V. Trachea Trachea, the wind pipe is a straight tube extending up to the mid-thoracic cavity. The wall of the trachea is supported by 'C' shaped rings of hyaline cartilage. These rings are incomplete dorsally and keep the trachea always open preventing collapse, Internally the trachea is lined by pseudostratified ciliated epithelium. VI. Bronchi and Bronchioles On entering the mid thoracic cavity, trachea divides at the level of the fifth thoracic vertebra in to right and left primary bronchi. Each primary bronchus enters the corresponding lung and divides into secondary bronchi that further divide into tertiary bronchi. Each tertiary bronchus divides and redivides to form primary, secondary, tertiary, terminal and respiratory bronchioles sequentially. Each respiratory bronchiole terminates in a cluster of alveolar ducts which end in alveolar sacs. Bronchi and initial bronchioles are supported by incomplete cartilaginous rings. The branching network of trachea, bronchi and bronchioles constitute the 'pulmonary tree' (an upside down tree). VH.Lungs Diagrammatic view of human respiratory system (Sectional view of the left lung is also shown)Basic Learning Material 6 Lungs occupy the greater part of the thoracic cavity. Lungs are covered by a double layered pleura, with pleural fluid between them. It reduces friction on the lung surface. The outer pleural membrane is in close contact with the thoracic lining whereas the inner pleural membrane is in contact with lung's surface. The part starting with external nostrils up to the terminal bronchioles constitute the conducting part, whereas the alveoli and 'their ducts form the respiratory or exchange part of the respiratory system. The conducting part transports the atmospheric air to the alveoli, dears it from foreign particles, humidifies and also brings the inhaled air to the body temperature. Exchange part is the site of actual diffusion of and between blood and atmospheric air. The lungs are situated in the thoracic chamber which is anatomically an airtight chamber, it is formed dorsally by the vertebral column, ventrally the sternum, laterally by ribs and on the lower side by the dome-shaped diaphragm. The anatomical setup of lungs in the thorax is such that any change in the volume of thoracic cavity will be reflected in the lung cavity. Such an arrangement is essential for breathing, as the pulmonary volume cannot be directly altered. Zoology-II 7 Body Fluids and CirculationUnitIIA Very Short Answer type Questions 1. Write the differences between open and closed system of circulation? Open type Closed type In this type blood flows freely in the body In this type blood flows through blood space, comes out of the blood vessels. vessels Ex:-Arthopods, molluscs, echinoderms Ex:- Annelids, Cephalopods and ascidians andvertebrates 2. Sino-atrial node is called the pacemaker of our heart why ? Ans:- Sino-atrial node(SAN) consists of specialized cardio myocytes. It has the ability to generate action potentials without any external stimulli hence called pace maker. 3. What is the significance of artrio ventricular node and atrio ventricular bundle in the functioning of the heart ? Ans:- Artioventricular node (AVN) is seen in the lower left corner of the right atrium close to the atrio ventricular septum. This is a relay point that relays the action potentials received from the SA node to the ventricular musculature. A bundle of nodal fibers called atrioventricular bundle of His continues from the AVN into the interventricular septum. 4.

Systemic arch(left) arises from the left ventricle and transported blood to different parts of the body. 7. Name the heart sounds when are they produced ? Ans:- Lub and Dub are the heart sounds. * At the time of ventricular systole the production of the first heart sound known as LUB * The ventricles now relax the production of the second heart sound known as DUB 8. Define Cardiac cycle and Cardiac out put ? Ans:-Cardiac cycle :- The Cardiac events that occur from the begining of one heart beat to the begining of the next constitute a cardiac cycle. Cardiac out put :- The volume of blood pumped out by the heart from each ventricle per minute is termed cardiac output. Cardia out put=Stroke volume No. of beats per minute. 9. What is meant by double circulation ? What is its significance ? Ans:- Blood has circulated two times through the heart in a complete circulation one is systemic circulation another is pulmonary circulation that is called double circulation. In systemic circulation, deoxygeneted blood collected from body parts (except Lungs) In pulmonary circulation heart receive the oxygenated blood from lungs. 10. Why the arteries are more elastic than the veins ? Ans:- Arteries are thick walled as the tunica media is relatively thick with elastin and smooth muscles but veins are thin walled and sightly muscular so arteries are more elastic than veins. Short Answer type Questions 1. Write the difference between open and closed system of circulation? Ans:- 1. Fishes have a 2-chambered heart with an atrium and ventricle. 2. Amphibians have a 3-chambered heart with two atria and one ventricle. 3. Reptiles have two atria and an incompletly divided ventricle (except in the crocodiles) 4. Birds and mammals possess a 4-chambered heart with two atria and two ventricles this is evolutionary development of the heart in vertibrates. 2. Describe the atria of the heart of man ? Ans:- Atria are thin walled receiving and upper chambers. The right one is larger than the left.Zoology-II 9 The two atria are separated by thin inter-atrial septum. In the fetal heart the atrial septum has a small pore called foramen ovale. Normally It is closed at birth, when Lungs become functional. If does not close properly it is called a patent foramen ovale. The right atrium receives deoxygenated blood from different parts of the body (except the Lungs) through two caval veins. It also receives blood from the myocardium through the coronary sinus, whose opening into the right atrium is guarded by the valve of thebesius opening of the postcaval vein is guarded by the Eustachian valve. Atria and ventricles are seperated by a membranous atrio-ventricular septum. The left and the right apertures are guarded by bicuspid (mitral valve) and tricuspid valves respectively. 3. Describe the ventricles of the heart of man ? Ans:- 1. Ventricles are the thick walled blood pumping lower chambers separated by an interventricular septum. 2. The wall of the left ventricles is thicker than that of the right ventricle. 3. The inner surface of the ventricles is raised into muscular ridges or columns called columnae carneae projecting from the inner walls of the ventricles. 4. Some of ridges are large and conical are called papillary muscules whose apices are connected to the chordae tendineae (or) heart strings 5. They are card-like collagenous processes that connect the papillary muscles to the tricuspid valve and the mitral valve in the heart. 4. Draw a labelaled diagram of the L.S. of the heart of man ? Internal structure of the HeartBasic Learning Material 10 5. Describe the events in a cardiac cycle briefly ? Ans:- Cardiac cycle consists of three phases namely (1) atrial systole (2) ventricular systole and cardiac diastole. Atrial systole :- The SAN now generates an action potential which stimulates both the atria to contract simultaneously causing the atrial systole. It lasts about 0.1sec Ventricular systole :- The action potentials from the SAN reach the AVN from where they are conducted through the bundle of His. Its branches and the purkinje fibres to the entire ventricular musculature. This causes the simuntaneous ventricular systole. It lasts for about 0.3 sec. In this stage first heart sound LUB is produced. Cardiac diastole:- The ventricles now relax and the ventricular pressure falls causing the closure of the semilunar valves which prevents the back flow of blood. This results in the production of the second heart sound known as DUB. 6. Explain the mechanism of clotting of blood ? Ans:- Cloting takes place in three essential steps:- Step-I :- It involving the formation of a complex of activated substances collectively called prothrombin activator. It is formed by a complex cascade of chemical reactions that occur in the blood by the involvement of clotting factors in two pathways (a) intrinsic pathway (b) Extrinsic pathway. Step-II:- The prothrombin activator in the presence of sufficiant amounts of ca++ causes the conversion of inactive prothrombin to active thrombin. Step-III :- Thrombin converts the soluble protein fibrinogen into soluble fibrin monomers, which are held together by weak hydrogen bonds. The fibrin stabilizing factor replaces hydrogen bonds with covalent bonds and cross links the fibres to form a mesh work. The insoluble mesh work of fibrin fibers spreading in all directions adhere to the damaged surface and trap the blood cells and platelets. within a few minutes after the clot is formed. It begins to contract so that the fluid is expelled out. This is called clot retaction and the fluid thus formed is the serum. 7. Distinguish between SAN and AVN ? Ans: SAN AVN 1. Sinoatrial node. 1.

Arteries end in Capillaries. 8. Veins start with Capillaries. Long Answer type Questions 1. Describe the structure of the heart of man with the help of neat labelled diagram ? Ans:- Structure of the heart:- The heart is mesodermal in origin. It is a thick walled muscular and pulsating organ situated in the mediastinum. It is covered by a double walled pericardium which consists of the outer fibrous pericardium and the inner serous pericardium. The serous pericardium is double layered formed of an outer parietal layer and an inner visceral layer. The two layers are separated by a narrow pericardial space, which is filled with the pericardial fluid. This fluid reduces friction between the two membranes and allows free movement of the heart. The wall of the heart consists of three layers. They are the outer epicardium, the middle myocardium and the inner most endocardium. The endothelium covers the heart valves also and is continuous with the endothelial lining of the large blood vessels connected to the heart. External structure Human heart has four chambers, with two relatively smaller upper chambers, called atria and two larger lower chambers called ventricles. Atria and ventricles are separated by a deep transverse groove called coronary sulcus. The muscular pouch like projection from each atrium is called auricular appendix. The ventricles are separated by two inter ventricular grooves, in which the coronary arteries and their branches are lodged.Basic Learning Material 12 Internal structure i) Atria: Atria are thin walled 'receiving chambers' (upper chambers). The right one is larger than the left. The two atria are separated by thin inter-atrial septum. In the fetal heart, the atrial septum has small pore called foramen ovale. Normally the foramen ovale closes at birth, when lungs become functional. It is represented by a depression in the septum between the right and left atria, called fossa ovalis (that marks the position of the foramen ovale in the fetus). If, the foramen ovale does not close properly, it is called a patent foramen ovale. Internal structure of the Heart The right atrium receives deoxygenated blood from different parts of the body (except the lungs) through two caval veins. It also receives blood from the myocardium (wall of the heart) through the coronary sinus, whose opening into the right atrium is guarded by the valve of Thebesius. Opening of the postcaval vein is guarded by the valve of the inferior vena cava or Eustachian valve. It directs the blood to the left atrium through the foramen ovale, in the foetal stage, but in the adult it becomes rudi- mentary and non-functional. The openings of the precaval veins into the right atrium have no valves. The left atrium receives blood from each lung through two pulmonary veins, which open into the left atrium. Atria and ventricles are separated by a membranous atrio-ventrlcular septum, which possesses left and right atrioventricular apertures. The left and right apertures are guarded by bicuspid (mitral valve) and tricuspid valves respectively. ii) Ventricles: These are the thick walled blood pumping chambers (lower chambers), separated by an interventricular septum. The wall of the left ventricle is thicker than that of the right ventricle. The inner surface of the ventricles is raised into muscular ridges or columns called colomnae carneae/ trabeeulae carneae projecting from the inner walls of the ventricles. Some ofZoology-II 13 these ridges are large and conical, and are called papillary muscles, whose apices are connected to the chordae tendinae, or 'heart strings'. They are cordlike collagenous processes that connect the papillary muscles to the tricuspid valve and the mitral valve in the heart. They prevent the cusps of the atrioventricular valves from bulging too far into atria during ventricular systole. Nodal tissue A specialized cardiac musculature called the nodal tissue is also distributed in the heart. A patch of this tissue called the sinoatrial node (SAN) is present in the right upper corner of the right atrium near the openings of the superior vena cavae. Another mass of this tissue, called the atrioventricular node (AVN), is seen in the lower left corner of the right atrium close to the atrioventricular septum. A bundle of nodal fibres called atrioventricular bundle (AV bundle/'His' bundle) continues from the AVN into the inter-ventricular septum. It divides into right and left bundle branches. These branches give rise to minute fibres called Purkinje firbres that extend throughout the ventricular musculature / walls of the respective sides. iii) Aortic arches: The pulmonary arch arises from the left anterior angle of the right ventricle. Its opening is guarded by the pulmonary valve and it carries deoxygenated blood to the lungs. The systemic arch (left) arises from the left ventricle and transports oxygenated blood to different parts of the body through its branches. Its opening is guarded by the 'aortic valve'. The pulmonary and aortic valves are madeup of three semilunar flaps, each. A fibrous stand, known as ligamentum arteriosam is present at the point of contact of the systemic and pulmonary arches. It is the remnant of the ductus arteriosus, which connects the systemic arch pulmonary arches in the embryonic stage. 2. Write notes on the working of the heart of man ? Ans:-Cardiac cycle :- The cardiac events that occur from the begining of one heart beat, to the beginning of the next constitute a cardiac cycle. This cardiac cycle consists of three phases, namely atrial systole, ventricular systole and cardiac diastole To begin with, all the four chambers of the heart are in a relaxed state/joint diastole stage- Blood from the pulmonary veins and venae cavae flows into the respective atria. As the A-V valves are in open condition, blood flows into the left and right ventricles, through, the left and right atrioventricular apertues. The semilunar valves of the pulmonary and aortic arches are closed at this stage. Atrial systole :- The SAN now generates an action potential which stimulates both the atria to contract simultaneously causing the 'atrial systole'. It lasts about 0.1 sec. This increases the flow of blood into the ventricles by about 30%. It means atrial systole accounts for about 30% of the filling of the ventricles, the remaining blood flows into the ventricles before the atrial systole.Basic Learning Material 14 Ventricular systole The action potentials from the SAN reach the AVN from where they are conducted through the bundle of His, its branches and the Purkinje fibres to the entire ventricular musculature. This causes the simultaneous ventricular systole. It lasts for about 0.3 sec. The atria undergo relaxation coinciding with the ventricular systole. Ventricular systole increases the pressure causing the closure of the AV valves preventing the 'backflow' of blood. It results in the production of the first heart sound known as 'Lub'- As the ventricular pressure increases further, the semilunar valves guarding the pulmonary artery and the aorta are forced open. This allows the blood in the ventricles to flow into the aortic arches and enter the circulatory pathway. Cardiac diastole The ventricles now relax and the ventricular, pressure falls causing the closure of the semilunar valves which prevents the back flow of blood. This results in the production of the second heart sound known as 'Dub'. As the ventricular pressure declines further, the AV valves are pushed open by the pressure in the atria exerted by the blood, which flowed into them through the larger veins. The blood now once again flows freely into the ventricles. All the heart Chambers are now again in a relaxed state (Joint diastolic phase). Soon, another cardiac cycle sets in. Cardiac output The volume of blood pumped out by each ventricle, for each heart beat, is known as the stroke volume. The volume of blood pumped out by the heart from each ventricle per minute is termed cardiac output. Cardiac output = stroke volume x No. of beats per minute 70ml/ beat x 72 beats/minute = 5040 rnl/min. or approximately 5 liters Double circulation :- The blood pumped by the right ventricle enters the pulmonary artery, whereas the left ventricle pumps blood into the aorta. The deoxygenated blood pumped into the pulmonary arch is passed on to the lungs from where the oxygenated blood is carried by the pulmonary veins into the left atrium. This pathway constitutes the pulmonary circulation (lesser circulation). The oxygenated blood entering the aorta is carried by a network of arteries, arterioles and capillaries to the tissues from where the deoxygenated blood is collected by a system of venules, veins and vena cavae and emptied into the right atrium. This is the systemic circulation (greater circulation). The systemic circulation provides nutrients, O 2 and other essential substances to the tissues and collects CO 2 and other harmful substances away, for their elimination.

Ans:- The wall of the afferent renal arteriole has juxtra glomerular cells. They are modified smooth muscle cells of the afferent arteriole. A Group of modified epithelial cells of the distal convoluted tubule are crowded in this region constituting the macula densa. 10. Distinguish between the enzymes renin and rennin Ans:- Renin:- It is an cells nephron (kidney). the conversion angiotensinogen into angiotensin. Rennin:- It is a proteolytic enzyme found in the gastric juice of infants Case in Calciumparacaseinate It converts Case in into Calciumparacaseinate in the presence of Calcium ions. 11. What is meant by the term osmoregulation? Ans:- The process of maintaining the quantity of water and dissolved solutes in balance is refferred to as Osmoregulation. Short Answer type Questions 1. Terrestrial animals are generally either ureotelic (or) uricotelic and not ammonotelic why? Ans:- 1. Ammonia is highly toxic and readily soluble in water hence it should be eliminated from the body quickly and in a very dilute solution. There- fore excretion of ammonia is most common in aquatic species. 2. Uria is 100000 times less toxic than ammonia. Urea excreting ani- mals require much less water. 3. Uric acid is less toxic than urea and being insoluble in water can be excreted as semisolid paste or pellets with very little water loss. 4. This is a great advantage for animals with litttle access to water so Terrestrial animals are generally either ureotelic (or) Uricotelic.Zoology-II 17 2. Differentiate vertebrates on the basis of the nitrogenous waste products they excrete giving example ? Ans:-Ammonotelism :- The elimination of ammonia as the chief nitrogenous waste material is turned ammonotelism Ex:- Aquatic animals like fishes Ureotelism :- The elimination of urea of the principal nitrogenous waste material is temned ureotelism Ex:- Earth worms, Amphibiens, Cartilagenous fishes and mammals. Uricotelism :- The elimination of uric acid as the chief nitrogenous waste material is called uroicotelism Ex:- Arthropods, Reptiles and birds. 3. Draw a labeled diagram of the L.S. of kidney ? L.S of Kidney 4. Describe the internal structure of kidney of man ? Ans:- 1. A longtitudinal section of the human kidney shows two distinct regions the outer cortex and the inner medulla 2. The medulla is divided into multiple cone shaped masses of tissue called renal pyramids 3. The renal pyramids are separated by the projections of the cortex called \"columns of Bertin\". 4. The both of each pyramid originates at the border between the cortex and the medulla and terminates in the renal papilla 5. Renal papillae project into cup like calyces, formed by the funnel shaped pelvis, which continues out as the ureter.Basic Learning Material 18 5. Explain micturition ? Ans:-1. Urine formed by the nephrons is ultimately carried to the urinary bladder where it is stored till a voluntary signal is given by the \"Central Nervous System\"(CNS) 2. This signal is initiated by the stretching of the urinary bladder as it gets filled with urine. 3. In response the stretch receptors on the walls of the bladder send signals to the central nervous system (CNS) 4. The CNS passes on motor messages to initiate the contraction of smooth muscles of the bladder and simultaneous relaxation of the urethral sphincter, causing the release of urine. 5. The process of passing out urine is called micturition and the neural mechanism involved is called micturition reflex. 6. Give a brief account of the counter current mechanism ? Ans:- 1. Mammals have the ability to produce concentrated urine. 2. The henle's loop and vasa recta play a significant role in this 3. The flow of the renal filtrate in the two limbs of Henle's loop is in opposite directions and thus forms a counter current. 4. The flow of blood through the two limbs of vasa recta is also in a counter current pattern. 5. The Proximity between the Henle's loop and vasa recta as well as the counter current of renal fluid and blood in them help in maintaining an increasing as molarity towards the medullary interstitium. 6. Transport of substances facilitated by the special arrangement of Henles loop and vasa recta is called the counter current mechanism 7. This mechanism helps to maintain a concentration gradient in the medullary interstitium 7. Describe the role of liver, lungs and skin in excretion ? Ans:-Liver:- It is the largest gland in our body. It changes the decomposed haemoglobin of the wormout RBCs into bile pigments and biliverdin. These pass into the alimentary canal along with the bile for elimination. The liver also excretes cholesterol steroid harmones. certain vitamins and drugs via bile. Lungs:- Lungs regularly eliminate about 18L of Co 2 and also significant amount of water per day in the form of water vapour in normal resting condition. The quantity of water loss increases in dry climates various voltile materials are also eliminated through the lungsZoology-II 19 Skin:- Human skin possesses two types of glands for the elimination of certain substances through their secretion. Sweat glands:- Secrete a watery fluid called sweat primary function of sweat is to facilitate a cooling effect on the body surface. It also helps in the removal of some of the wastes like Nacl small amount of urea, lactic acid provides a protective \"oily covering\" to the skin. Long Answer type Questions 1. Describe the excretory system of man giving the structure of a nephron ? Ans:-Human Excretory System In humans, the excretory system consists of a pair of ureters, a urinary bladder and urethra. Kidneys: Kidneys are reddish brown, bean shaped structures, situated on either side of the vertebral column between the levels of the last thoracic and third lumbar vertebrae, in a 'retroperitoneal position'. The right kidney is slightly lower than the left one due to the presence of liver. Basic Learning Material 20 The outer surface of the kidney is convex and the inner surface has a deep notch called hilum, the point at which the renal artery and nerves enter and the renal vein and ureter leave. Each kidney is surrounded by a tough, fibrous capsule that protects its delicate inner surface. Internal structure :- A longitudinal section of the human kidney shows two distinct regions, the outer cortex and the inner medulla. The medulla is divided into multiple cone shaped masses of tissue called renal pyramids. The renal pyramids are separated by the projections of the cortex called columns of Bertin (renal column). The base of each pyramid originates at the border between the cortex and the medulla and terminates in the renal papilla. Renal papillae project into cup like calyces, formed by the funnel shaped pelvis, which continues out as the ureter. Ureters :- These are slender whitish tubes which emerge from the pelvis of the kidneys. Their walls are lined by transitional 'epithelium'. The ureters run downwards and open into the urinary bladder. Urinary bladder :- It is a median storage sac, situated in the lower abdominal cavity. It has thick, muscular, distensible wall lined by 'transitional epithelium'. The neck of the bladder leads into the urethra, which has an internal urethral sphincter (made of smooth muscles) and external urethral sphincter (made of striped muscles). Urethra opens near the vaginal orifice in the females and through penis in the males. Structure of a Nephron Each kidney has nearly one million nephrons which are the 'structural' and 'functional' units. Each nephron has two parts the Bowman's capsule' and the renal tubule. The Bowman's capsule encloses a tuft of capillaries called glomerulus, formed by the afferent renal arteriole - a fine branch of the renal artery. Blood from the glomerulus is carried away by an efferent renal arteriole of a lesser diameter. The blind end of the tubule forms a double walled cup called Bowman's capsule, which surrounds the glomerulus. The inner wall of the Bowman's capsule has certain unique cells called podocytes which wrap around each capillary. The podocytes are arranged in an intricate manner so as to leave some minute spaces called 'filtration slits ' or 'slit pores'. The endothelial cells of the capillaries have numerous pores or 'Finestrations'. The glomerulus along with the Bowman's capsule constitutes the Malpighian body or renal corpuscle.Zoology-II 21 (A diagrammatic representation of a nephron showing blood vessels, collecting duct and tubule) The tubule continues further and forms a highly coiled proximal convoluted tubule (PCT). A hairpin shaped Henle's loop, which has descending and ascending limbs, is the next part of the tubule. The proximal part of the ascending limb is thin and the distal part is thick. The thick ascending limb continues into the distal convoluted tubule (DCT). The DCT continues as the initial collecting duct' in the Cortex. Some initial collecting ducts unite to form a straight collecting duct, which passes through the medullary pyramid. In the medulla, the tubes of each pyramid join and form the duct of Bellini which finally opens on the tip of the renal papilla. The contents of the duct of Bellini are dis- charged into the renal pelvis the renal calyx. The Malpighian situ- ated in the cortical region of the kidney, whereas the loop of Henle is in the medulla. In a majority of nephrons, the loop of Henle is too short and extends only very little into the medulla. Such nephrons are called cortical nephrons. In some of the nephrons, the loops of Henle are very long and run deep into the medulla. These nephrons are called juxtamedullary nephrons. The efferent arteriole emerging from the glomerulus forms a fine capillary network called the peritubular capillaries, around the renal tubule. The portion of the peritubular capillaries their surrounds the loop of Henle is called the vasarecta. The vasarecta is absent or highly reduced in the cortical nephrons. The juxtamedullary nephrons possess well developed vasarecta. 2. Explain the physiology of urine formation Ans:-The formation of urine involves three main processes namely, glomerular filtration, selective reabsorption and tubular secretion.Basic Learning Material 22 The first step in the formation of urine is the 'filtration' of the blood from the glomerulus into the lumen of the Bowman's capsule and this 'passive' (non-energy consuming process) process is called glomerular filtration. The hydrostatic pressure of the blood while flowing in the glomerulus is 60 mmHg. It is opposed by glomerular colloidal osmotic pressure of 32 mmHg (which is exerted by the non-filtered plasma proteins of the blood in the glomerular capillaries) and Bowman's capsular hydrostatic pressure of 18mmHg. The net filtration pressure is 10mm Hg (6O-32+18=10). This causes the filtration of blood through the 3 layered filtrate membrane formed by the endothelial cells of glomerular capillary together with the basement membrane and podocytes of the Bowman's cup. Blood is filtered through the fine slit pores and fenestrations due to the NFP. Therefore, this process is called 'ultrafiltration'. The filtrate contains almost all the constituents of the plasma, except the proteins. The filtrate thus formed is called ultrafiltrate or 'glomerular filtrate' or 'primary urine', which is hypotonic to the cortical fluid. It passes into the next part of the renal tubule. b) Selective reabsorption and secretion: The tubular epithelial cells in different segments of a nephron reabsorb certain substances of the glomerular filtrate either by active or passive mechanisms. About 85% of the filtrate formed is reabsorbed In a constant, unregulated fashion by the PCT and descending limb of Henle's loop (obligatory or mandatory reab- sorption) and the reabsorption of the rest of the fluid is 'regulated'. Based on the necessity of re-absorption, the substances of glomerular filtrate can be categorized into 'high threshold substances (essential and are efficiently reabsorbed e.g. glucose, amino acids, vitamins, some salts etc.), 'low threshold substances (absorbed in very little amounts e.g. urea, uric acid etc.) or 'athreshold substances' (actual excretory products and are not reabsorbed at all e.g. creatinine). During the formation of urine, the tubular cells secrete substances such as H+. K+ and NH3 into the filtrate. Tubular secretion is also an important step in the formation of urine, as it helps in the maintenance of ionic and acid-base balance of the body fluids. Mechanism of selective reabsorption and secretion in different parts of a nephron takes place as follows: i) In the proximal convoluted tubule: PCT is lined by simple cuboidal epithelium with 'brush border', which increases the surface area of ab- sorption. Nearly all the essential nutrients and 70-80% of electrolytes and,water are reabsorbed by this segment. Na+is actively transported into the cortical interstitial fluid. This transfer of positive charge drives the passive transport of Cl-. Glucose, amino acids, and other essential substances are also 'actively' transported. Movement of water occurs by 'osmosis'. PCT also helps to maintain the pH and ionic balance of the body fluids by selective secretion of hydrogen ions, and ammonia into the filtrate and by the re absorption of K+ and HCO3- from it.Zoology-II 23 ii) In the Henle's loop: Reabsorption in this segment is minimum. However, this region plays a significant role in the maintenance of high osmolarity of the medullary interstitial fluid. The descending limb of loop of Henle is permeable to water and almost impermeable to electrolytes, hence reabsorption of water continues as the filtrate moves along the descending limb (passive transport). As a result, the filtrate concentration gradually increases as it moves towards the inner medulla. The ascending limb has two specialized regions, aproximal thin segment, in which NaCl diffuses out into the interstitial fluid passively, and a distal thick segment in which NaCl is actively pumped out. The ascending limb is impermeable to water. Thus the filtrate becomes progressively more dilute as it moves up to the cortex (towards the DCT). iii) In the distal convoluted tubule (DCT) The cells here are shorter than those In the proximal tubule and lack 'microvilli, indicating that they are not much in reabsorption. 'Conditional reabsorption'/ 'facultative reabsorption' of Na+ and water takes place in this segment. The reabsorption of water is variable depending on several conditions and is regulated by ADH. DCT is also capable of reabsorption of HCO3-and selective secretion H+ and NH3 into the DCT from the peritubular network, to maintain the pH and sodium-potassium balance in the blood. Reabsorption and secretion of major substances at different pairs of the nephron (arrows indicate direction of movement of materials)Basic Learning Material 24 iv) In the collecting duct (CD) This long duct carries the filtrate through the medulla to the renal pelvis. Considerable amount of water could be reabsorbed from this region to produce concentrated urine. This segment allows passage of small amount of urea to the medullary interstitum to keep up its osmolarity. It also plays a role in the maintenance of pH and ionic balance of blood by the selective secretion of H+ and K+ ions. The renal fluid after the process of facultative reabsorption in the C.D. influenced by ADH, constitutes the 'Urine'. That is sent out. Urine in the C.D is hypertonic to the plasma of blood.

Myoglobin content is less 2. Contain more number of 2. Contain less number of Mitochondria. Mitochondria 3. They use oxygen for the production of 3. They depend on anaerobic process ATP so they are called as aerobicmuscles for the release of energy. Short Answer type Questions 1. Describe the important steps in muscle contraction. Ans:- Sliding filament theory of muscle contraction was proposed by Jean Hanson and Hugh Haxley. The series of events that can be studied in muscle contraction are. 1) Excitation of Muscle :- Central nervous system sent a signal through motor nerve. It releases neuro transmitter (acetycholine) at neuromuscular junction, which generates anaction potential in the sarcolemma. This action potential spreads to the triad system. Triad system releases calcium into the sarcoplasm.Basic Learning Material 26 2) Formation of Cross bridges :- The releated calcium ions bind with Tn-c subunit of the troponin of the action filament. This makes troponin and troponin and tropomyosin complex move away from the active sites of Actin filaments. Now the active sites are exposed to the myosin heads. Hydrolysis of ATP provides energy for myolin heads to bind with active sites on the actin molecules to form a cross bridge and P is released. 3) Power Stroke :- The cross bridge pulls the attached actin filaments towards the centre of the \"A\" band. The \"Z\" lines attached to these actin filaments are also pulled inwards from both the sides there by causing shortening of the sarcomere i.eid contraction. During the shortening of the muscle, the \"I\" bands get reduced in size length where as the \"A\" bands retain their size. Myofilaments donot actually shorten. 4) Recovery Stroke :- The myosin releases ADP and goess back to its relaxed state. A new ATP molecule binds to the head of myosin and the cross bridge is broken. The new ATP is hydrolysed by the ATPase of the myosin head and the cycle of cross bridge formation and break age is repeated. 5) Relaxation of muscle :- When motor impulses stop the calcium ions are pumped backto sarcopla smic cisternac. Active site of Actin are marked, myosin fails to bind with Actin filaments. So the 'Z'lines return to their original position. 2. Describe the structure of Skeletal muscle ? Ans:- Skeletal muscle in our body is made of a number of \"muscle bundles\" or \"fascicles\". Each of cylindrical muscle fibres. The fascicles are held together by a connective tissue called \"fascia\" Ultra Structure of Skeletal muscle fibre Each muscle fibre is lined by the plasma membrane called sarcolemma enclosing sarcoplasm. Skeletal muscle cells are multinucleate reticulum also called sarco plasmic reticulum of the muscle fibres is the store house of calcium ions. Muscle fibre possess a large number of parallel filaments called myofilaments or myofibrils in the sarcoplasm. Structure of myofibril Each myofril has alternate dark and light bands in it. Straited appearance is due to the distribution of two important proteins actin and myosin. The lightband contains actin and two regulatory proteins called troponin and tropomyosin. The light band is called I-band or Iso- tropic band. The dark band or Anisotropic band contains myosin filaments. In the middle of the I band is anelastic fiber called \"Z\"line. Actin filaments or thin filaments attached to it. Thick filaments or myosin filaments are held together in the middle of A band by a membrane called \"M\" line the bands A and I are arranged alternately giving striatedappearance. Sarcomere :- The portion of the myofibril between two successive \"Z\" lines is called \"Sarcomere\" It is the functional unit of contraction. The central part of \"A\" band without the thin filaments is called \"H\" zone / \"H\" band / Hensens disc.Zoology-II 27 3. Write Short notes on contractile Proteins ? Ans:- Each actin (thin) filament is made of two 'F' (filamentous) actin molecules helically wound around each other. is a polymer of monomeric 'G' (globular) actin molecules. Two filaments of another protein, called tropomyosin also run close to the 'F' actin molecules, through- out their length. A complex protein called 'troponin' is distributed at regular intervals on the tropomyosin. Thin filament Troponin is made of three polypeptide units myosin site on the actin. Tn-c can bind to Ca2+. When calcium ions are not bound to troponin (Tn-C), it stabilizes tropomyosin in its blocking position over the active sites of actin. When Calcium ions attach to the Tn- C of the troponin, the tropomyosin moves away/is pulled away from the active sites allowing the myosin heads to bind to the active sites of actin. Troponin and tropomyosin are often called regulatory proteins, because of their role in masking and un- masking the active sites. Myosin is a motor protein that is able to convert chemical energy in the ATP molecules into mechanical energy. Each myosin (thick) filament is a polymerized Thick filament protein. Many monomeric proteins called meromyosins constitute one thick filament. Each meromyosin has two important parts, a globular head with a short arm (neck) and a tail. The globular head with short arm is composed of heavy meromyosin (HMM) and the tail is made of light meromyosin (LMM). The short arm / neck serves as a 'flexible link' between the head and tail regions. There are about 200-300 molecules of myosin per thickBasic Learning Material 28 filament. Half of the myosin molecules have their 'heads' oriented towards one 'Z' membrane and the other half towards the other 'Z' membrane of the same sarcomere, so as to pull actin molecules/ thin filaments from either side. It means the 'tails' of all myosin molecules in an 'A' band are directed towards the 'M' line. The head and short arm project outwards at regular distances and angles from each other from the surface of a polymerized myosin filament and is known as cross arm. Each head has two binding sites, one for ATP and the other for an active site on the actin molecule. The heads on the two ends of the thick filaments are oriented in opposite directions to pull in actin filaments of both the sides. 4. Draw neat labeled diagram of the ultra structure of muscle fibre. 5. Draw the diagram of a sarcomere of skeletal muscle showing different regions. SarcomereZoology-II 29 6. What is cori's cycle explain the process. Ans:- The lactic acid produced during rapid contractions of skeletal muscles under low availability of oxygen is partly oxidized and a major part of it is carried to the liver by the blood, where it is converted into pyruvic acid(pyruvate) and then to glucose through gluconeogenesis. The glucose can enter the blood and be carried to muscles and immediately used. If, by this time the muscles have stopped contraction, the glucose can be used to rebuild reserve of glycogen through glycogenesis. This two way traffic between skeletal muscle and liver is called the Cori cycle Long Answer type Questions 1. Explain the Menchanism of Muscle Contraction ? Ans:- Mechanism of muscle contraction is best explained by the 'Sliding Fila- ment Theory'. It states that contraction of a muscle fibre takes place by the sliding of the thin filaments over / in between the thick filaments. It was proposed by Jean Hanson and Hugh Huxley. The process of muscle contraction can be studied under the following heads: \\i) Excitation of musle : Muscle contraction is initiated by a signal sent by the central nervous system (CNS) via a motor neuron. A neural signal reaching the neuromuscular junction releases a neurotransmitter (acetylcholine) which generates an 'action potential' in the sarcolemma. When the action potential spreads to the triad system through the T tubules, the cisternae of the sarcoplasmic reticulum release calcium ions into the sarcoplasm. Mechanism of Muscle Contraction ii) Formation of Cross bridges : Increase in the Ca2+ level leads to the binding of calcium ions to the subunit Tn-C of the troponin of the thin filaments. This makes troponin andBasic Learning Material 30 tropomyosin complex to move away from the active sites of actin molecules. Now, the active sites are exposed to the heads of the myosin. Utilizing the energy released from hydrolysis of ATP, the myosin head now binds to the exposed 'active sites' on the actin molecules to form a cross bridge and P1 is released iii) Power Stroke : The cross bridge pulls the attached actin filaments towards the centre of the 'A' band. The 'Z' lines attached to these actin filaments are also pulled inwards from both the sides, thereby causing shortening of the sarcomere, i.e., contraction. During the shortening of the muscle, the 'I' bands get reduced in Sliding Filaments size/length (Z membranes of the sarcomere are brought closer), whereas the 'A' bands retain their size/length. It is important to note that myo- filaments do not actually shorten. As the thin filaments are pulled deep in to the A bands making the H bands narrow, the muscle shows the effectcontraction. iv) Recovery Stroke : The myosin, goes back to its relaxed state and releases ADP. A new ATP molecule binds to the head of myosin and the cross-bridge is broken. The new ATP is again hydrolysed by the ATPase of the myosin head and the cycle of cross bridge formation, and pulling of thin filaments is repeated causing further sliding. Relaxation of Muscle : When motor impulses stop the Ca2+ ions are pumped back into the sarcoplasmic cisternae. It results in the masking of the active sites of the actin filaments. The myosin heads fail to bind with the active sites of actin. These changes cause the return of 'Z' lines back to their original position, i.e., relaxation.

Two types of synapse are presentZoology-II 33 (i) Electrical (ii) Chemical synapses. (i) Electrical Synapses. (a) The gap between the membranes of pre synaptic and post synaptic neurons is less in case of electrical impulses. (b) The electrical synapses act as conductive links between two neurons. These are also called as \"gap junctions\". (c) The impulse transmissions through an electrical synapse is always faster than that across a chemical synapse.

Ans:- It is protected inthe cranial cavity and covered by cranial meninges namely duramater arachnoid mater and piamater Duramater most double layered membrance. Arachnoid mater is athin middle layer. The space between dura mater and arachnoid membrane is called sub dural space. Piamater is innermost layer, it is separated from archnoidmembrane by the subarchnoid space. The brain can be divided into three major parts. 1. Fore brain (Prosecephalon) 2. Mid brain (Mesencephalon) 3. Hind brain (Rhombencephalon) I. Fore brain (Prosencephalon) :- The fore brain consists of 1) Olfactory bulb2) Cerebrum 3) Diencephalon Olfactory bulb :- Olfactory to smell from the olfactory epithelium. Cerebrum :- Cerebrum forms the major part of the brain. It is divided into the left and the right cerebral hemispheres by longitudinal fissure. The two hemispheres are internally connected by a transverse, wide myelinated fibres beneath the cortex called corpus callosum. It brings coordination between these two hemispheres. The surface of the cerebrum has grey matter with more neuronal cell bodies is called cerebral cortex. The surface of the cerebral cortex has many folds and grooves. The folds are called gyri, the groove are called fissures or sulci. Gyri and sulci increase the surface area of the cerebral cortex. Cerebral cortex has three functional areas called a) sensory areas, that receive and interpret the sensory impulses b) motor areas, which control voluntary muscular movements c) association areas, which are neither clearly sensory nor motor in function and they deal with more complexZoology-II 35 'integrative functions' such as memory and communications. The cerebral medulla consists of mostly myelinated axons (white matter). Each cerebral hemisphere of the cerebrum is divided into four lobes namely frontal, parietal, temporal and occipital lobes. iii. Diencephalon (Thalamencephalon): The main of are the epithalamus, thalamus and hypothalamus. i) Epithalamus: It is the roof of the diencephalon. It is a non-nervous part which is fused with the pia mater to form the anterior choroid plexus. Just behind the anterior choroid plexus, the epithelium of the epithalamus forms a pineal stalk, which ends in a rounded structure called pineal body. ii) Thalamus: It lies superior to the mid brain. It is the major coordinating centre for sensory and motor signalling. iii) Hypothalamus (the thermostat of the body): It lies at the base of : the thalamus. The hypothalamus forms a funnel-shaped downward extension called 'infundibulum', connecting the hypothalamus with the pituitary gland. It also contains several groups of neurosecretory cells, which secrete hormones called hypothalamic hormones. Hypothalamus controls and integrates the activities of the autonomous nervous system (ANS) and it has osmoregulatory, thermoregulatory, thirst, feeding (hunger) and satiety centres. Limbic system: The inner parts of the cerebral hemispheres and a group of associated deep structures like amygdala or amygdale, hippocampus etc. form the limbic system. The limbic system along with hypothalamus is involved in the regulation of sexual behaviour and expression of emotional reactions. II. Midbrain (Mesencephalon) The midbrain is located between the thalamus/hypothalamus of the forebrain and the pons Varolii of the hindbrain. The ventral portion of the midbrain consists of a pair of longitudinal bands of nervous tissue called cerebral peduncles or crura cerebri (sing: crus cerebrum) (which connect the cerebral hemispheres with the pons). The dorsal portion of the midbrain consists of four rounded lobes called corpora quadrigemina (Four optic lobes). The two larger anterior optic lobes are called superior colliculi and the smaller posterior lobes are called inferior colliculi. The superior colliculi and the inferior colliculi are concerned with visual and auditory functions, respectively.Basic Learning Material 36 III. Hindbrain (Rhombencephalon) The hind brain cerebellum, oblongata. 1. Cerebellum ('the little brain'): It is the second largest part of the brain. It consists of two cerebellar hemispheres and a central vermis. Each cerebellar hemisphere consists of three lobes namely anterior, posterior and floccular lobes. It has a branching tree - like core of white mater called arbor vitae (the tree of life) surrounded by a sheath of grey matter (cerebellar cortex). Cerebellum is responsible for the control and coordination of lo- comotor movements. The cerebellum is called the 'gyroscope of the body' because it maintains equilibrium. Damage to cerebellum often results in ataxia (uncoordinated voluntary muscle movements). 2. Pons Varolii: It lies in front of the cerebellum below the mid brain and above the medulla oblongata. It consists of nerve fibres which form a bridge between the two cerebellar hemispheres. It is a relay station between the cerebellum, spinal cord and the rest of the brain. Pons has the pneumotaxic centre. 3. Medulla oblongata: It is the posterior most part of the brain. It extends from the pons Varolii above and continuous with the spinal cord below. It has a very thin, vascular folded structure called posterior choroid plexus. Medulla includes cardiovascular and respiratory centers, the centers for swallowing, vomiting, cough ing, sneezing and hiccupping. The midbrain, pons and the medulla oblongata are together referred to as the 'brain stem'.The medulla oblongata passes out of the 'cranium through the foramen magnum and joins the spinal cord. Sagittal section of human brainZoology-II 37 Ventricels of the human brain Human brain consists of four ventricles. The first and second ventricles (lateral ventricles or paracoels) are present in the right and left cerebral hemispheres respectively. The third ventricle (diocoel) occurs in the diencephalon. The two paracoels are connected to the median diocoel individually by the two 'foramina of Monro' . The fourth ventricle (myelocoel) is present in the medulla. The myelocoel and the diocoel are connected by a narrow canal called iter or aqueduct of Sylvius/ cerebral aqueduct. The metacoel is continuous with the central canal of the spinal cord. The ventricles of the brain, and the subarachnoid space are filled with Cerebro-spinal fluid (CSF). CSF is an alkaline, colourless fluid which is filtered from the choroid plexuses into the ventricles of the brain. 2. Explain the transmission of nerve impulse through a nerve fibre with the help of suitable diagrams. Ans:- Nerve cells exhibit a special property called electrical excitability. The signal that travels along the length of a nerve fiber and ends in the release of neurotransmitters is called a nerve impulse. Neurons can re- spond to external and internal stimuli and conduct nerve impulses (ac- tion potentials) because in a neuron a membrane potential is established across the neuronal membrane. It means there is an \"unequal distribution of ions\" (charged atoms) on the two sides of a nerve cell membrane with the cell's interior more negative with respect to that of the exterior. Ions keep moving in and out of an axon through several 'ion channels'. The axolemma of a neuron has the following three different types of ion channels. 1) Leakage channels: They are k+ and Na+ leakage channels. K+ leakage channels are more than those of Na+ leakage channels. Hence axolemma has greater than Na+ ions. Ligand-Gated are located in the post synaptic membrane (dendrites and cell bodies) and open or close in response to chemical stimuli. 3) Voltage Gated channels: These channels open in response to a change in membrane potential. There are sodium voltage gated and potassium voltage Gated channels across the axolemma. Sodium voltage gated chan- nels are of two types. They are sodium activation and inactivation voltage gated channels. For K+ only potassium activation voltage gated channel is present.Basic Learning Material 38 Resting membrane potential The resting membrane potential exists because of a small buildup of negative ions in the axoplasm along the inside of the membrane, and an equal buildup of positive ions in the extra cellular fluid along the outer surface of the membrane. Such a separation of positive and negative electrical charges is a form of potential energy. In neurons, the resting membrane potential ranges from -40 to -90 mV. A typical value is -70 mV. The minus sign indicates that the inside of the cell is nega- tive relative to the outside. At resting phase, the axolemma is polarized. The membrane potential can change from its resting value when the membrane's permeability to particular ions changes. If the inner side becomes less negative, it is said to be depolarized. If the inner side becomes more negative, it is said to be, hyperpolarized. During the resting phase the activation gates of sodium are losed, the inactivation gates of sodium are open and the activation gates of potassium are closed. Sodium - potassium pump Sodium and potassium ions diffuse inwards and outwards , respectively, down their concentration gradients through leakage channels. Such a movement of ions, if unchecked, would eventually disturb the resting membrane potential. These flows of ions are offset by sodium - potas- sium, pumps (Na+ / K+ATPases) present in the axonal walls. These pumps expel three Na+ ions for each two K* ions imported. As these pumps remove more positive charges from the axoplasm than they bring into it, they contribute to the negativity of the resting membrane poten- tial i.e., -70mv. Depolarization (Rising phase) When a nerve fibre is stimulated, the plasma membrane becomes more permeable to Na+ ions than to K+ ions as the activation and inactivation voltage gates of sodium open and activation voltage gates of potas- sium close. As a result the rate of flow of Na+ into the axoplasm exceeds the rate of flow of K+ to the ECF. Hence, the axolemma is positively charged inside and negatively charged outside. This reversal of electrical charge is called] \"depolarization \" Outer face of the point which is adjacent to the site of depolariza- tion remains positively charged. The electrical potential difference be- tween these two areas is called \"action potential \". An action potential occurs in the membrane of the axon of a neuron when depolarization reaches a certain level called 'threshold potential ' (-55 mV). The par- ticular stimulus which is able to I bring the membrane potential to thresh- old is called 'threshold stimulus '. The action potential occurs in re- sponse to a threshold stimulus or supraj threshold stimulus but .does not occur at subthreshold stimuli. It means the nerve impulse is either conducted totally or not conducted at all and this is called 'all- or - none principle '. Due to the rapid influx of Na+ ions, the membrane potential shoots rapidly up to +45 mV (spike potential).Zoology-II 39 Repolarization (Falling phase) As the wave of depolarization passes away from its site of origin to the adjacent point, the activation gates of sodium remain open, inactivation gates of sodium close and activation gates of potassium open at the site of origin of depolarization. As a result the influx of Na+ ions into the axoplasm from the ECF is checked and 'efflux' of K+ions occurs, which leads to the returning of axolemma to the resting state. This is called 'repolarization '. Hyperpolarization (Undershoot) The repolarization typically goes more negative than the resting potential to about -90 mV. This is called 'hyperpolarization '. This occurs because of the increased K+ permeability that exists while voltagegated K+ channels are open ( however they close 'rather slowly as K volt- age gates are said to be 'lazy' gates), activation and inactivation gates of Na+ channels remain closed. The membrane potential returns to its original resting state as the K+ channels close completely. As the voltage falls below the -70mV level of the resting state, it is called 'under- shoot' Nerve impulseBasic Learning Material 40 Endocrine System and Chemical CoordinationUnitIVA Very Short Answer Questions 1.

Short Answer Questions 1. List out the names of endcrine glands present in human beings and mention the hormones they secrete. Ans:- Human body has no. of endocrine glands among them pituitory is one of the important gland. Pituatory gland is divided into posterior pituitory or neuro hyphophysis. Between these two is a small zone called the pars intermedia. a) Anterior pituitory/Adenohypophysis :- Six hormones are produced by Anterior pituitory 1) Growth hormone 2) Pralactin 3) Thyroid stimulating hormone TSH 4) Adreno cortico progesterone. Inaddition to these non endocrine tissues organs the kidney, heart and gastro intestinal tract produce hormones. Heart - Atrial natriuretic factor secretin cholecytokinin, GIPBasic Learning Material 42 2. Describe the role of hypothalamus as a neuro endocrine organ. Ans:- The hypothalamus is located below the thalamus. constituting the floor of the diencephalon. a part of the fore brain. It connects the neural and endocrine systems as it is closely tied to the pituitary gland. It responds to the sensory impulses received from different receptors by sending out appropriate neural or endocrine signals. It regulates a wide range of body functions. It contains several groups of neurosecretory cells called 'nuclei' which produce hormones called neuro-hormones. They are transported to the neurohypophysis through the axons of the hypothalamos- hypophysical tract. The two types of hormones produced by the hypothalamus are 1) the releasing hormones (which stimulate secretion of pituitary hormones), and 2) the inhibiting hormones (which inhibit secretions of pituitary hormones). The hypothalamus is the 'Master Control Centre' of the endocrine system, as its secretions directly control the pituitary gland which in turn secretes hormones that regulate the growth and functioning of other endocrine glands. For example, a hypothalamic hormone called growth hormone releasing hormone (GHRH/ Somatocrinin) stimulates the synthesis and release of Somatotropin (growth hormone) by the pituitary. On the contrary the growth hormone-inhibiting hormone (GHIH) or somatostatin from the hypothalamus inhibits the release of growth hormone from the pituitary. These hormones originating in the hypothalamic neurons pass through axons and are released from their nerve endings. They reach the anterior pituitary through a portal circulatory systeim called hypo physial portal system and regulate the functions of the anterior pituitary. The posterior pituitary is under the direct neural regulation of the hypothalamus. 3. Give an account of the secretions of pituitory gland. Ans:- The located the hypo- thalamus. It is divided into anterior pituitory or adenohypophysis and posterior pituitary or neurohypophysis. Between these two is a small zone called the pars intermedia. I. Anterior pituitory/Adenohypophysis It produces 6 hormones. They play major role in the control of metabolic functions throughout the body. a) Growth hormone :- (Somatotropin) This hormone stimulates cell division in the epiphyseal plates leading to elongation of bones. They also promote growth of the entire body by accelerating protein synthesis, cell division and cell differentiation. b) Prolactine :- It is also called lactogenic hormone/luteotrophic hormone (LTH). It causes enlargement of the mammary glands of the breasts and prepare them for the productionZoology-II 43 of milk. In women it initiates and sustain lactation. It also maintain corpus luteum of the ovary, which produces progesterone that helps to sustain pregnancy. c) Thyroid Stimulating Hormone :- TSH(Thyrotropin) stimulates the synthesis and secretions of thyroid hormones from the thyroid gland. d) Adreno corticotropic Harmone :- (ACTH) controls the synthesis and secretion of steroid hormones called glucocorticids by the adrenal cortex. e) Follicle stimulating hormone (FSH) :- It stimulates growth and development of the ovarian follicles in females in males FSH along with the androgens, regulates spermatogenesis f) Luteinizing hormone:- (LH) In the and secretion of androgens (testosterone) In female it stimulates ovulation and also stimulates ovary to produce estrogens and progesterone. II. Pars interonedia :- It secretes only one hormone called melanocyte stimulating hormone (MSH). The role of MSH is not significant in man. III. Posterior pituitory :- Neurohypophysis it produces two hormones. There are called as neuro hormones. a) Oxytocin b) Vassopression / ADH a) Oxytocin :- In a female it stimulates powerful contractions of the uterus during child birth and ejection of milk from the mammary glands. b) Vasopression :- It stimulates reabsorption of water and electrolytel by DCT and the collecting duct from nephric filtrate. Thus urine becomes concentrated and diuresis is prevented. Hence is also called antidiuretic hormone (ADH) 4. Compare a \"pituitory dwarf\" and a \"thyroid dwarf\" in respect of similaritie Ans:-Pituitory dwarf Thyroid growth hormone 1.

Abnormal skin, deafness, mutism appear 4.The pituitory dwarf sexually and 4. Thyroid dwarf is physically mentally retarded, intellectually a normal individual low intelligence quotient and they are sterile growth is stunted Similarities 1. growth is stunted 1. growth is stunted 5. Explain how hypothyroidism and hyperthyroidism can affect the body ? Ans:-Effects of Hypothyroidism :- During pregnancy, due to hypothyroidism, defective development of the growing baby leads to a disorder called cretinism. (deficiency of thyroid hormones by birth). Stunted growth, mental retardation, low intelligence quotient, abnormal skin, deafness and mutism are some of the characteristic features of this disease. In adult women, hypothyroidism may cause irregular menstrual cycles. In adults the hypothyroidism results in a condition called myxedema. Lethargy, mental impairment, intolerance to cold, puffiness of face and dry skin are some of the symptoms of myxedema. Effects of Hyper thyroidism :- Over activity of the thyroid, cancer of the gland or development of nodules of thyroid lead to hyperthyroidism. In adults abnormal growth causes a disease called exophthalmic goiter, with characteristically protruded eyeballs Hyperthyroidism also affects the physiology of the body (increased metabolic rate). Inadequate supply of iodine in the diet results in hypothyroidism and enlargement of the thyroid gland. This condition is called simple goiter. 6. Write a note on addison's disease and cushing's syndrome ? Ans:-Addison's disease is caused due to hyposecretion of glucocorticoids by the adrenal cortex. This disease is characterised by loss of weight, muscle weakness, fatigue and reduced blood pressure. Sometimes darkening of the skin in both exposed and nonexposed parts of the body occurs in this disorder. This disorder does not allow an individual to respond to stress. Cushing's syndrome : It results due to over production of glucocorticoids. This condition is characterized by breakdown of muscle proteins and redistribution of body fat resulting in spindly arms and legs accompanied by a round moon face, buffalo hump on the back an pendulous abdomen. Wound healing is poor. The elevated level of cortisols causes hyperglycemia, over deposition of glycogen in liver and rapid gain of weight.Zoology-II 45 7. Why does sugar appear in the urine of a diabetic ? Ans:- Insulin which is secreted by the cells of Islets of Langerhans of the pancreas, regulates the normal glucose level in the blood. It mainly acts on the liver cells and adipocytes and increases the uptake and utilization of glucose by the body cells. Glucose is taken up by the hepatocytes, Skeletal muscles and adipocytes thus reducing the level of glucose in the blood (hypoglycemia). Insulin promotes conversion of glucose into glucogen (glycogenesis) in the target cells (hypoglycemic hormone). Under secretion of insulin by the pancreatic gland increases the level of glucose in blood hyperglycemia. Prolonged hyper glucemia leads to a complexdisorder called diabetes mellitus, associated with loss of glucose through urine \"glycouria\" and formation of harmful compounds called ketone bodies. 8. Describe the male and female sex harmones and their actions. Ans:- Male Sex Hormones : 1. Androgens are the male sex hormones which are secreted by the interstitial cells of Leydig in the testes. 2. Testosterone is the chief androgen produced in males. 3. These hormones are responsible for the development, maturation and activity of the male accessory sex organs like vas deferens, seminal vesicles, prostrate gland etc. 4. These hormones regulates the growth of muscles, facial hair and axillary hair, development of low pitch voice, aggressiveness etc. 5. Spermatogenesis is regulated by the androgens and the androgens control the male sexual behavior and also stimulates the anabolism of proteins and carbohydrates. Female Sex Hormones : (a) Female sex hormones are produced by the ovaries which are the female gonadal organs. (b) Estrogen and progesterone are the two chief female sex hormones produced in females. Estrogen : 1. It is synthesized by the growing follicles and corpus luteum of ovary. 2. It is required for the development and functioning of females accessory sex organs, high pitch voice, development of ovarian follicles, and mammary glands. 3. It helps in controlling female sexual behavior.Basic Learning Material 46 Progesterone: 1. It is synthesized by corpus luteum and placenta. 2. It prepares the uterus for implantation of the blastocyst in the uterus wall. It inhibits uterine contractions and maintains the pregnancy. 3. It stimulates the secretion of milk from the mammary glands. 9. Write a note on the mechanism of action of hormones ? Ans:- Hormones stimulate or inhibit the target cells' activities. Hence they are called regulators. Hormones play a vital role in regulating the functions of the body. Hormones produce their effects on target tissue by binding to specific proteins called hormone receptors located in the target tissues only. Hormone receptors present on the cell membranes of the target cells are called membrane bound receptors and the hormone receptors present inside the target cells are called intracellular receptors. Hormone receptors are specific, as each receptor is specific to a certain hormone only. A Hormone and its receptor protein together form a hormone receptor complex. This hormone receptor complex generates bio- chemical changes in the target cells. Hormones interacting with membrane bound receptors do not enter the target cell, but they generate 'second messengers' (e.g. Cyclic AMP produced from ATP by of the enzyme adenylate cyclase/Adenylyl cyclase, IP3, Ca++ etc). These second messengers regulate cellular metabolism in the target cells in a cascading action amplifying the final effect. In this way even a very small quantity of the hormone can cause a series of enzymatic actions, each step having a muluplicating effect, bringing a powerful cascading effect. We can take an example to understand the action of hydrophilic hormone, such as Epinephrine, which cannot enter a cell. In the liver cells 1) Epinephrine attaches to cell membrane receptor 2) G protein of cell membrane binds to GTP and activates adenylate cyclase, a membrane enzyme 3) Activated Adenylate cyclase forms cAMP from ATP 4) activates -phosphate and it, in turn produces glucose. Thus the liver cell is able to produce several molecules of glucose needed to the cell under the action of epnephrine (one of the fight and flight responses of the body).Zoology-II 47 (Mechanism of hormonal action (a) Membrane bound- receptor mechanism (b) Intracellular receptor mechanism) Hormones which interact with intracellular receptors (e.g. steroid hormones, iodothyronines, etc.) are lipid soluble and they diffuse through the plasma membrane into the cytoplasm. They bind to certain internal receptors, enter the nucleus and regulate gene expression. The hormonal mechanism of steriod hormones is called mobile receptor mechanism Basic Learning Material 48 Immune SystemUnitIVB Very Short Answer Questions 1. Define the terms immunity and immune system ? Ans:- Abiity of an individual to fight against the disease causing organisms is called immunity. The network of organs, cells and proteins that protect the body from harmful, infectious agents such as bacteria, viruses, animal parasites, fungi etc., is called the Immune system. 2. Define the non-specific lines of defence in the body ? Ans:- Whenever bacteria, viruses, fungi and parasites try to enter the body of an organism, skin mucus membranes and the enzyme lysozyme of saliva, tears prevent their entry. This is called the first line of defence. If micro organisms cross the first line of defence and enter the body the phagocytes, natural killer cells, antimicrobial substances. Inflammation, fever etc., destroy them. This is called the second line of defence. These two lines of defence are very fast reacting responses but they are not specific. 3. Differentiate between matureB-cells and functional B-cells. Ans:- Mature B cells synthesize various types of antibodies which are displayed on their membrane surfaces. The antibodies on the mature B cells can take antigens so these are called as immune-completent B-cells. These mature immuno-competent B-cells reach the secondary lymphoid. Organs and develop into functional immune B cells. 4. Write the names of any four mononuclear phagocytes. Ans:- 1) Kupffer cells 2) Microglia cells 3) Synomial cellsZoology-II 49 5. What are complement proteins? Ans:- These are group of inactive plasma proteins and cell surface proteins. When activated, they form a membrane attack complex (MAC) that forms a pore in the plasma membrane of the affected cells, allowing ECF to enter the cells and make it swell & burst. 6. \"Colostrum is very much essential for the new born infants\" justify. Ans:- The colostrum secreted by the mother during the initial days of lactation has abundant Ig A antibodies, to protect the infant. 7. Differentiate between perforins and granzymes. Ans:-Perforins: Form pores in the cell membrane of infected cells. Granzymes : Enter the infected cells through these perforations and activate Certain proteins which help in the distruction of the infected cell (apoptosis). 8. Explain the mechanism of vaccination or immunization. Ans:- The principle of vaccination or immunization is based on the property of the memory of the immune system. During the process of vaccination, inactivated or weakened pathogens (vaccines) or antigenic proteins of the pathogen are introduced into the body of the host. They initiate the production of appropriate antibodies in the host and also generate memory-B cells and memory T cells. On subsequent exposures, the memory cells recognise that pathogen quickly and overcome the invader with a rapid and massive production of antibodies. 9. Mention various types of immunological disorders Ans:- a) Immuno deficiency disorders b) Hypersensitivity disorders c) Auto-immune disorders 10. More and more people in metrocities of india are prone to allergies justify. Ans:- Exposure to various types of pollutants in the urban atmosphere leads to allergies. High percentage of pollutants in the air in metro cities of india cause allergy in more and more people. 11. What are auto immune disorders ? Give any two examples ? Ans:- Generally our immune system can recognise our own proteins and does not attack our own tissues. Unfortunately, in some cases our immune system fails to recognise some of our own body proteins and treats them as foeign antigens that results inattack on our own tissues. This leads to auto immune diseases. Ex:- \"Graves disease\", \"Rheumatoid arthritis\"Basic Learning Material 50 12. How can the graft rejections be avoided in patients ? Ans:- Tissue matching and blood group matching are essential before undertaking any graft or transplant. Even after this, the patient has to take immuno suppressant drugs throughout their life. Short Answer Questions 1. Write short notes on B-cells. Ans:- Based on the size, lymphocytes can be divided into small lymphocytes and large lymphocytes. Small lymphocytes include B-cells and T-cells, wheres the large lymphocytes include large granular lymphocytes that consist of Natural killer cells (NK- cells) B-cells (B-Lymphocytes): The lymphocytes capable of producing antibodies and can capture circulating antigens are called B-cells, They are produced from the 'stem cells' in the bone marrow of adult mammals, liver of foetus and bursa of Fabricius in birds. Mature B-cells synthesize various types of antibodies which are displayed on their membrane surfaces. The mature B- cells are also called immuno-competent B-cells. These mature immuno- competent B-cells reach the secondary lymphoid organs and develop into functional immune cells which later differentiate into 'long lived' memory cells and 'effector' plasma cells. The plasma cells produce anti- bodies specific to the antigen to which they are exposed. Memory cells store information about the specific antigens and show quick response, when the same type of antigen invades the body later. 2. Write short notes on immunoglobulins. Ans:- Antibodies (immunoglobulins): Whenever pathogens enter our body, the B-lymphocytes produce an army of proteins called antibodies to fight with them. They are highly specialized for binding with specific antigens. The part of an antibody that recognizes an antigen is called the paratope (antigen binding site)- Based on their mobility, antibodies are of two types, namely circulating or free antibodies and surface antibodies. The circulating or free antibodies are present in the body fluids whereas the surface antibodies are present on the surface of the mature B-cells as well as the memory cells. Zoology-II 51 Structure: The basic structure of an antibody was proposedby Rodney Porter. It is a Y shaped molecule with four polypeptide chains of which two are long, Identical Heavychains (H) and two are small, identical light chains (L). Hence, an antibody is represented as H2L2. The two chains are linked by disulphide bonds. One end of the antibody molecule is called Fab end (Fragment- antigen binding) and the other end is called FC end (Fragment-crystalliz- able or Fragment-cell binding). Based on the structure, the antibodies are of five types, namely IgD, IgE, IgG, IgA and IgM. IgD, IgE and IgG are monomeric units, whereas IgA is dimeric and IgM is a pentameric form of antibody. 3. Describe various types of barriers of innate immunity. Ans:- The inborn resistance to diseases, possessed by all the living organisms is called innate immunity different types of barriers of innate immunity a) Physical barriers :- Skin and mucous membranes are the main physical barriers. Skin prevents the entry of micro organisms. Where as mucous membranes help in trapping, killing the microbes entering our body. b) Physiological barriers :- Secretions of the body like Hcl in the stomach, saliva in the mouth, tears from the eyes are the physiological barriers against microbes. Saliva, tears, sweat contain \"lysozyme\" which can digest the bac- terial cell walls. Oil(sebum) sweat of skin hane a pH range of 3-5 making the skin an effecting inhibitor of microbial growth. c) Cellular barriers :- Poly morpho nuclear leukocytes (PMN-neutrophils), monocytes and natural killer cells in the blood as well as macrophages in the tissue are the main cellular barriers. They phagocytose and destroy the microbes. d) Cytokine barriers :- The cytokines secreted by the immune cells are involved in differentiation of the cells of immune system and protect the non-infected cells from further infection. 4. Explain the mechanism of humoral immunity. Ans:-Mechanism of Humoral immunity (HI) In the secondary lymphoid organs, the free antigens bind to the Fab end of the antibodies that are present on the surface of mature B-cells. They engulf and process the antigens. Then they display the antigenic fragments on their membrane with the help of Class-II MHC molecules.Basic Learning Material 52 Then appropriate TH cells recognize them and interact with the antigen- MHC-II complex and release a type of interleukin which stimulates the B-cells to proliferate and differentiate into memory cells and plasma cells. The plasma cells release specific antibodies into the plasma or extra cellular fluids. These antibodies help in opsonising and immobolising the bacteria, neutralising and cross linking of antigens leading to agglutination of insoluble antigens and precipitation of soluble antigens. They also activate the phagocytes and complement systems. The products of antigen, antibody reactions are called 'antigen- antibody complexes' or immunocomplexes, which are removed by eosinophils and monocytes. 5. Explain the mechanism of cell mediated immunity. Ans:-Cell Mediated Immunity (CMI): The immunity mediated by the activated T-cells, natural killer cells, etc., is known as cell mediated immunity. It is effective against both exogenous and endogenous antigens. It does not involve antibodies. Mechanism of Cell mediated immunity (CMI) Antigen presenting cells process the exogenous antigens whereas the altered self-cells process endogenous antigens. Then, the processed antigenic fragments are displayed on their (APCs or ASCs) membranes. They are recognised by T-cells. Binding of T-cells to the APCs or ASCs causes the production of activated T cells and memory T cells. The activated TH cells secrete various types of interleukins which transform activated Tc cells into effector Cytotoxic T-Lymphocytes (CTLs / Killer cells). They attach to the infected cells and release certain enzymes called perforins and granzymes perforins form pores in the cell membrane of the infected cells. Then granzymes enter the infected cells through these perforations and activate certain proteins (e.g. capases) which help in the destruction of the infected cell apoptosis). The NK cells are similar in their action to CTLs. where as the CTLs destroy the infected cells in an antibody dependent manner. Zoology-II 53 6. Explain the mechanism by which HIV multiplies and leads to \"AIDS\" Ans:- HIV after getting into the body of a person it enters the TH cells, macrophages or dendritic cells. In these cells the ss RNA of HIV synthesizes a DNA strand \"complementary\" to the viral RNA using the enzyme reverse transcriptase. It also catalyses the formation of the second DNA strand complementary to the first stand forming the double stranded viral DNA. This viral DNA gets incorporated in the DNA of the host cells DNA by a viral enzyme (integrate) and it is in the form of a \"provirus\". Transcription of DNA results in the production of RNA which can act as the genome for the new viruses or it can translated into viral proteins. The various components of the viral particles are assembled and the HIV are produced. The infected human cells continue to produce virus particules and in this way they act like HIV generation factories. New viruses bud off from the host cells they attack TH cells of the infected person leading to immuno deficiency in him. Even though HIV attacks cells with CD4 marker, only TH cells are destroyed and not the \"macro phages\". The gp 120 molecules on the surface of HIV attach to CD4 receptors of hu- man cells, mostly the TH cells. Attack on certain types of cell /tissues only by viruses such on HIV is referred to as \"tissue tropism\". There is time lag between the first infection and appearance of symptoms. This period may vary from few months to many years. As the no. of TH cells decreases in the person develops immuno deficiency. Gradually the person starts suffering from infections due to bacteria, viruses, fungi. The person also suffers from bouts of fever, diarrhoea & loss of weight. Now the AIDS patient become so immuno deficient that they are unable to protect themselves against these minor infections, which normal healthy people can easily overcome.

Zona Pellucida is surrounded by corona radiate, further it is surrounded by membrane granulose. 5. A fluid filled cavity called antrum is located with in the membrane granulose. 6. Oocyte is surrounded by few granulose cells called cumulus ophorus. 7. This follicle is surrounded by a connective tissue layer called theca. 8. It contains two layers outer theca externa and innter theca interna. 9. At the time ovulation the graffian follicle ruptures/breaks and releases secondary oocyte into the body. 2. Describe the structure of seminiferous tubule. Ans:- There are about 250 testicular lobules lobule seminiferous tubules. of membrane vaginalis covers the testis. Each seminiferous tubule is lined by the germinal epithelium which consists of undifferentiated male germ cells called spermatogonial mother cells and it also bears nourishing cells called sertoli cells. The spermatogonia produce the primary spermatocytes which undergo meiotic division, finally leading to the formation of spermatozoa or sperms (spermatogenesis).Basic Learning Material 58 Sertoli cells provide nutrition to the spermatozoa and also produce a hormone called Inhibin, which inhibits the secretion of FSH. The regions outside the seminiferous tubules contain interstitial cells of leydig or leydig cells. Leydig cells produce androgens the most important of which is testosterone,. Testosterone controls the development of secondary sexual characters and spermatogenesis. 3. What is spermatogenesis? Briefly describe the process of spermato- genesis in man. Ans: In the testis, the immature male germ cells, spermatogonia produce sperms by spermatogenesis that begins at puberty. The spermatogonial stem cells present in the seminiferous tubules, multiply by mitotic divisions and increase in numbers. Each spermatogonial cell is diploid and contains 46 chromosomes. Some of the spermatogonial stem cells develop into primary spermatocytes which undergo meiosis periodically. A primary spermatocyte completes the first meiotic division (Meiosis-I) leading to formation of two equal sized, haploid cells called secondary spermatocytes, which have only 23 chromosomes each. The secondary spermatocytes undergo the second meiotic division (Meiosis-II) to produce four equal sized haploid spermatids. The spermatids are transformed into spermatozoa (sperms) by the process called spermiogenesis. After spermiogenesis, sperms heads become embedded in the sertoli cells, and are finally released from the seminiferous tubules by the process called spermiation. 4. What is oogenesis? Give a brief account of oogenesis in a woman. Ans: The process of formation of a mature female gamete is called oogenesis. At puberty 60000-80000 primordial follicles are present in each ovary. Later the flattened follicular cells become cuboidal and proliferate to produce a stratified epithelium which constitutes the membrana granulosa. The cells are called granulosa cells. Follicles at this stage of development are called primary follicles. A homogenous membrane, the zona pellucida, appears between the primary oocyte and granulose cells.Zoology-II 59 The innermost layer of granulosa cells are firmly attached to zona pellucida forming the corona radiata. A cavity (antrum) appears within the membrana granulosa. The follicular cavity increases in size. As the result, the wall of the follicle becomes relatively thin. The oocyte now lies acentrically in the follicle surrounded by some granulosa cells. It is called cumulus oophorus. As the follicle expands the stromal cells surrounding the membrane granulose become condensed to form a covering called the theca interna, Outside the theca interna some fibrous tissue becomes condensed to form another covering called theca externa. Now these follicles are called secondary follicles. The celles of theca interna later secrete a hormone called oestrogen. At this stage, the primary oocyte within the secondary follicle grows in size and completes meiosis- I resulting the formation of large haploid secondary oocyte and a tiny first polar body (haploid). The secondary follicle further changes into the mature follicle called graafian follicle. 3. Draw a labelled diagram of a graafian follicle. Diagrammatic Sectional view of ovary 4. In our society women are often blamed for giving birth to daughters. Can you explain why this is not correct? Ans:- The chromosome pattern in the human female is XX and that in the male is XY. Therefore, all the haploid gametes produced by the female (ova) have the sex chromosome X whereas in the male gametes (sperms) the sex chromosome could be either X or Y, hence, 50 per cent of sperms carry the X chromosome while the other 50 per cent carry the Y. AfterBasic Learning Material 60 fusion of the male and female gametes the zygote would carry either XX or XY depending on whether the sperm carrying X or Y fertilised the ovum. The zygote carrying XX would develop into a female baby and XY would form a male. That is why, scientifically it is correct to say that the sex of the baby is determined by the father and not by the mother. 5. Describe the placenta in a woman. The placenta consists of two essential portions: The maternal part of the placenta derived from the endometrium of the uterus and contains uterine epithelium, uterine capillary tissue and as allantois also fuses with the chorion in process of vascularisation. Placenta is discoidal as the villi are restricted to the dorsal surface of the blastodisc. Placenta is haemochorial as the maternal blood comes into direct contact with the foetal chorion During the parturition the placenta is cast off with loss of embryonic membranes. So it's is called as deciduate placenta. Long Answer Questions 1. Describe female reproductive system of a woman with the help of a labeled diagram. Ans:- The female reproductive system consists of a pair of ovaries along with a pair of oviducts, uterus, vagina and the external genitalia along with a pair of mammary glands. Ovaries: A pair of ovaries is located on one each side of the lower abdomen connecting with mesovarium. The ovaries are covered on the outside with germinal epithelium. Underneath these layers, there is a dense connective tissue the tunica albuginea. The ovarian stroma is distinctly divided into an outer cortex and an inner medulla. The cortex appears more dense and granular due to the presence of numerous ovarian follicles in various stages of development. The medulla is a loose connective tissue with abundant blood vessels, lymphatic vessels, and nerve fibers. Fallopian tubes (oviducts): Each fallopian tube extends from the periphery of each ovary to the uterus, and it bears a funnel shaped infundibulum. The edges of theZoology-II 61 infundibulum possess finger like projections called fimbriae, which help in collection of the ovum after ovulation. The infundibulum leads to a wider part of the oviduct called ampulla. The last part of the oviduct, isthmus has a narrow lumen and it joins the uterus. Fallopian tube is the site of fertilization; it conducts the ovum or zygote towards the uterus by peristalsis. The fallopian tube is attached to the abdominal wall by a peritoneal fold called mesosalphinx. Uterus: Uterus is a large, muscular, highly vascular structure present in the pelvis between bladder and the rectum. It is connected to the abdominal wall with peritoneal fold called mesometrium.the uterus opens into the vagina through cervix. The cavity of the cervix is called cervical canal. Vagina: The vagina is a muscular tube that extends from the cervix to the vestibule. It is lined by non-keratinised stratified squamous epithelium. Its highly vascular and opens into the vestibule by the vaginal orifice. Vulva:The term refers to external genitals of the female. The vestibule has two apertures- the upper external urethral orifice, lower vaginal orifice. Vestibule is bound by two pairs of fleshy folds of tissue called inner labia minora and larger outer labia majora. Clitoris is a sensitive erectile structure homologous to penis of a male as both are supported by corpora cavernosa internally. Accessory reproductive glands of female: Bartholins's glands : two glands located slightly posterior and to the left and right of the opening of the vagina. They secrete mucus to lubricate the vagina. Skene's glands : located on the anterior wall of the vagina, secrete a lubricating fluid when stimulated. Homologous to prostate gland in male. Mammary glands : the glandular tissue of each breast is divided into 15-20 mammary lobes containing clusters of cells called alveoli. The cells of alveoli secrete milk which is stored in the cavities of the alveoli. The tubules of each lobe join to form a mammary duct. Several mammary ducts join to form mammary ampulla which is connected to lactiferous duct through which forms an opening in the nipple milk is sucked out by the baby. A diagrammatic sectional view of Mammary glandBasic Learning Material 62 2. Describe male reproductive system of a man. Draw a labelled diagram of it. Ans:-Testes:- The testes (testicles) are a pair of oval pinkish male primary sex organs suspended outside the abdominal cavity within a pouch called scrotum. The cavity of the scrotal sac is connected to the abdominal cavity through the inguinal canal. Testes is held in position in the scrotum by the gubernaculum, a fibrous cord that connects the testis with the bottom of the scrotum and spermatic cord, formed by vas deferens, nerves, blood vessels and other tissues that run from the abdomen down to each testicle, through the inguinal canal. Each testis is enclosed in a fibrous envelope, the tunica albuginea, which extends inward to form septa that partition the testis into lobule. There are about 250 testicular lobules in testis. lobule seminiferous tubules. of membrane vaginalis covers the testis. Each seminiferous tubule is lined by the germinal epithelium which consists of undifferentiated male germ cells called spermatogonial mother cells and it also bears nourishing cells called sertoli cells. The spermatogonia produce the primary spermatocytes whicdh undergo meiotic division, finally leading to the formation of spermatozoa or sperms (sper- matogenesis). Sertoli cells provide nutrition to the spermatozoa and also produce a hormone called inhibin, which inhibits the secretion of FSH. The regions outside the seminiferous tubules contain interstitial cells of leydig or leydig cells. Leydig cells produce androgens the most important of which is testosterone. Testosterone controls the development of secondary sexual characters and spermatogenesis. The seminifeorous tubules open into the : the vasa efferentia leave the testis and open into a narrow, tightly coiled tube called epididymis located along the posterior surface of each testis. The epididymis provides a storage space for the sperms and gives the sperms time to mature. It is differentiated into three regions: caput epididymis, corpus epididymis and cauda epididymis. Vasa deferentia : is a long narrow, muscular tube. It starts from the tail of the epididymis, passes through the inguinal canal into the abdomen and loops over the urinary bladder. It receives a duct from seminal vesicle. Both the ducts unite to form an ejaculatory duct. The ejaculatory ductsconverge in the centre and open into urethra. Urethra: in males urethra is the shared terminal duct of the reproductive and urinary systems. The urethra originates from the urinary bladder and provides an exit for urine as well as semen during ejaculation. Penis: the penis serves as a urinal duct and also intromittent organ that transfers spermatozoa to the vagina of a female. The human penis is made up of three columns of tissue; two upper corpora cavernosa on the dorsal and one corpus spongiosum n the ventral side. The enlarged bulbous end of penis called glans penis is covered by a loose fold of skin called prepuce.Zoology-II 63 The male accessory glands : include paired seminal vesicles, a prostate and bulbo urethral glands. Seminal vesicles : The secretion of seminal vesicles constitutes 60% of the volume of seminal fluid. It is an alkaline, viscous fluid that contains fructose, proteins, citric acid, inorganic phosphorus, potassium, and prostaglandins. Fructose is the main energy source for the sperm outside of the body. Prostaglandins are believed to aid fertilization by causing the mucus lining of the cervix to the sperm towards the ovum with peristaltic con- tractions of the uterus and fallopian tubes. Prostate glands: This gland is located beneath the urinary bladder and surrounds the prostatic urethra. The prostate contributes 15-30 percent of the semen. The fluid from the prostate is clear and slightly acidic. The prostatic secretion activates the spermatozoa urethral glands: Also called as cowper's glands, are located beneath the prostate gland at the beginning of the internal portion of the penis. The alkaline fluid secreted by these glands lubricates the urethra, and thought to be flush out the acidic urinary residues that remain in the urethra, before the semen is ejaculated.

Ans: (a) Sex should be avoided with unknown parterns / multiple partners. (b) Condoms should be used during sexual intercourse. (c) Detection of STDs at early stages and they should be treated by consulting qualified doctors in case of infections. 2. What in your view are the reasons for population explosion, especially in India? Ans:- Increased healthcare facilities along with better living conditions had an explosive impact on the population growth. Probable reasons for this growth rate are decline in death rate, maternal mortality rate and infant mortality rate. 3. It is true that 'MTP is not meant for population control'. Then why did the government of India legalize MTP? Ans:- It is considered to be the only available choice to get rid of unwanted pregnancies resulted due to casual unprotected intercourse, failure of the contraceptive used during coitus or in case of rapes or in the case of confirmed incurable genetic disorders in the foetus, in cases where continuation of pregnancy could be harmful or even fatal either to the mother or to the foetus or for both, MTP is the inevitable solution. 4. What is 'amniocenteses'? Name any two disorders that can be detected by amniocentesis. Ans:-Amniocenteses is a diagnostic procedure to detect genetic defects in the unborn baby. In this procedure, usually a needle is inserted through the mother's abdominal wall into amniotic sac by the expert physician. The chromosomes of the stained foetal cells are examined under a microscope for abnormalities like Down syndrome, Edward's syndrome and Turner's syndrome.Zoology-II 65 5. Mention the advantages of 'lactational amenorrhea method'. Ans:- Ovulation generally will not occur during the period of intense lactation by the mother following parturition, this is known as lactational amenorrhea. Some couples utilize the contraceptive benefit of these methods. Short Answer Questions 1. Briefly describe the common sexually transmitted diseases in human beings. Ans:-S.No. Name of the disease Causative organism HBV 8. HIV infection/AIDS HIV (human immuno deficiency virus) 2. Describe the surgical methods of contraception. Ans:- Surgical procedure to prevent pregnancy is also known as sterilization. Sterilization procedure in the male is called vasectomy and that in the female tubectomy. Vasectomy: A small part of the vas deferens on either side is removed or tied up through a small incision on the scrotum. Thus the sperms are prevented from reaching seminal vesicle and so the semen in vasectomised males do not contain sperms. Tubectomy: A small part of the fallopian tube on both sides is removed or tied up through a small incision made in the abdomen or through vagina. This will block the entry of ova into the fallopian tubes and thus pregnancy is prevented. 3. Write short notes on any two of the following. a) IVF b) ICSI c) IUDs Ans:-In Vitro Fertilization and Embryo Transfer (IVF-ET): fertilization of ovum by sperm done outside the body of a woman is called invitro fertilization. The resultant early embryonic stage is transferred into the mother's uterus for further development. Intra Uterine Devices (IUDs): These devices are inserted by doctors or expert nurses in the uterus through vagina. These Intra Uterine Devices are presently available as the non-medicated IUDs (e.g., Lippes loop), copper releasing IUDs (CuT, Cu7, MultiloadBasic Learning Material 66 375) and the releasing IUDs (Progestasert, LNG-20). IUDs increase phagocytosis of sperms within and the Cu ions released suppress sperm motility and the fertilising capacity of sperms. The hormone releasing IUDs, in addition, make the uterus unsuitable for implantation and the cervix hostile to the sperms. IUDs are ideal contraceptives for the females who want to delay pregnancy and/or space between children. It is one of most widely accepted methods of contraception in India. 4. Suggest some methods to assist infertile couples to have children. Ans:-In Vitro Fertilization and Embryo Transfer (IVF-ET): fertilization of ovum by sperm done outside the body of a woman is called invitro fertilization. The resultant early embryonic stage is transferred into the mother's uterus for further development. Zygote intrafallopian transfer (ZIFT): The ovum is extracted and fertilized outside the body (in vitro) and the zygote is transferred into the woman's fallopian tube to complete its further course of development. Gamete Intrafallopian Transfer (GIFT): in this method an ovum is collected from a donor is transferred to the fallopian tube of the recipient woman for fertilization. This is practiced in woman who cannot produce ova. Intracytoplasmic Sperm Injection (ICSI): The sperm is directly injected into the ovum with the help of a microscopic needle to form an embryo in the laboratory. Later the embryo is transferred to the uterus or fallo- pian tube for further development. Artificial Insemination (AI): In this technique, semen is collected from the husband/ healthy donor and is introduced in to the uterus for achieving fertilization. 5. Is sex education necessary in schools? Why? Ans:- Yes, introduction of sex education in schools is necessary. Government and non governmental agencies have come forward and have taken various measures to educate people on reproduction, sex etc. using different modes of media (audio, visual and print media). 1. Introduction of sex education in schools will provide them proper/right information regarding various aspects of reproductive health such as reproductive organs, safe and hygienic sexual practices, STDs etc. 2. This information to the young individuals (or) adolescent age groups will be very useful to them and also protect them from unwanted pregnancies. 3. People should be well informed about birth control options, care of mother during pregnancy, after birth care of baby and mother, importance of breast feeding, equal preference for both male and female child etc. 4. It will also help in bringing up healthy families of desired size. 5. Awareness should be created on sex abuse, sex related crimes, population growth etc. Zoology-II 67 GENETICSUnitVI Very Short Answer Questions 1. What is pleiotrophy?

What is haplo-diploidy? Ans:- Haplo-diplodidy is a mechanism of sex determination that is common in the hymenopteran insects such as honey bees, ants and wasps. In this system, the sex of the offspring is determined by the number of sets of chromosomes it receives. 12. What are Barr bodies? Ans:- In female mammals, the extra X-chromosome undergoes heterochromatinisation and becomes inactive during early embryonic development. This appears as a darkly-staining body attached to the nuclear membrane. These are called Barr Bodies.Zoology-II 69 13. What is Klienfelter's syndrome? Ans:- Klinefelter's syndrome is a genetic disorder caused by trisomy of 23rd pair (karyotype is 47, XXY). The principal effects are hypogonadism and reduced fertility, slight enlargement in breasts (gynecomastia). 14. What is Turner's syndrome? Ans:- Monosomy of 23rd pair (karyotype 45, X) is called Turner's syndrome. The symptoms of a Turner female are short stature, gonadal dysgenesis, webbed neck and broad shield like chest with widely spaced nipples. 15. What is Down syndrome? Ans:- Trisomy of 21st set (Karyotype is Trisomy 21 (47+21) is called as Down syndrome. The affected individual is short statured with small round head, furrowed tongue and partially open mouth. Physical, psychomotor and mental development is retarded. 16. What is Lyonisation? Ans:- The inactivation of an X-chromosome is called as Lyonisation, one of the two copies of the X-chromosomes present in the body cells of female mammals is inactivated. 17. What is sex-linked inheritance? Ans:- The inheritance of a trait that is determinate by a gene located on one of the sex chromosomes is called sex-linked inheritance. 18. Define hemizygous condition? Ans:- Hemizygous describes a diploid individual who has only one allele of a gene or chromosome segment rather than the usual two. A hemizygote refers to a cell or organism whose genome includes only one allele at a given locus. E.g. In mammals, males are hemizygous for genes on the Y chromosome. 19. What is crisscross inheritance? Ans:- The transmission of a character from father to grandson through his daughter is called crisscross inheritance. In crisscross inheritance, the character appears in alternate generation only. The sex linked characters exhibit crisscross inheritance. E.g. Haemophilia. 20. Why are sex-linked recessive characters more common in the male human beings? Ans:- X-linked diseases are mostly recessive and restricted to the males who carry the mutant allele. This is because males have only one X- chromosome, where as females have two. Thus, females who carry a single mutant allele are generally unaffected.Basic Learning Material 70 21. Why are sex-linked dominant characters more common in the female human beings? Ans:- Females are more likely to be affected by sex linked dominant characters as the females have 2 X-chromosomes, they have double chance to inherit the mutated allele. 22. What are sex limited characters? Ans:- The genes for sex limited characters are present on autosomes in both males and females and their phenotypic expression is limited to one sex only due to internal hormonal environment. e.g., Beard in man, development of breast in females. 23. What are the sex influenced characters? Ans:- The genes for sex influenced characters are autosomal genes in both male and female. They express in both males and females but with different way i.e., dominat in one sex and recessive in another sex. e.g., pattern baldness, horn formation of certain breeds of sheep. 24. How many base pairs are observed in human genome? What is the average number of base pairs in a human gene? Ans: Approximately 3164.7 million nucleotide base pairs or 3 billion nucleotide base pairs are observed in human genome. The average number of base pairs in human gene is 3000. 25. What is 'junk DNA'? Ans:- Some DNA is involved in regulating the expression of the genes that code for specific proteins, the remaining nonfunctional DNA is called Junk DNA. 26. What are the VNTRs? Ans:- Variable Number Tandem Repeat (VNTR) is a short sequence of repetitive DNA found on chromosomes. The VNTR or two persons shows different tandem repeats. They are used for parental identification. 27. List of any two applications of DNA finger printing technology. Ans:- 1. DNA finger printing technology helps in forensic analysis (Identification of suspect in a crime). 2. It helps in dealing medico legal cases for establishing paternity or maternity. 3. It helps in the identification of inheritance gene which is called pedigree analysis.Zoology-II 71 Short Answer Questions 1. What is pedigree analysis? Suggest how such an analysis, can be useful. Ans:- Scientists have devised an approach called pedigree analysis, to study the inheritance of a specified trait, abnormality or disease. Pedigree is a chart showing the record of inheritance of certain traits over two or more ancestral generations of a person in the form of a diagram of family tree (pedigree chart). Pedigree analysis is useful in many ways like it helps to work out the possible genotypes from the knowledge of the respective phenotypes. It helps to study the pattern of inheritance of a dominant or a recessive trait. The possible genetic makeup of a person for a trait can also be known with the help of the pedigree chart. Some of the important standard symbols used in the pedigree analysis are shown in the figure. Male female sex unspecified affected individuals mating mating between relatives (consanguineous mating) parents above and children below (in order of birth-left to right) parents with male child affected with disease five unaffected offspringBasic Learning Material 72 2. Describe erythroblastosis foetalis. Ans- Rh antigens and anti-Rh the disorder Erythroblastosis foetalis or Haemolytic disorder of the new born (HDNB). It occurs in an Rh+foetus whose father is Rh+positive and mother is Rh- negative. An Rh positive person has Rh antigen and no antibodies. An Rh negative person has no antigen or antibody. But antibodies may develop in Rh-negative person when the blood from Rh-positive person enters into him. When the mother is Rh -ve and father is Rh +ve (homozygous), also Rh +ve contain the antigens. These antigens enter the mother blood passing through the placenta and sensitize the mother. So the mother starts to develop antibodies against Rh antigen. By the time these antibodies are fully developed the first baby is born safely. For the second pregnancy, the mother now has fully developed antibodies against Rh antigen. Now the second child is also Rh +ve. With Rh antigens, the Rh antibodies (Ig G) developed in the mother then enter the developing foetus and causes Haemolysis and leads to the death of the foetus immediately after birth. This is due to incompatible blood group. This condition of death of foetus is known as Erythroblastosis foetalis. It can be prevented by inject- ing the Rh-antibodies to the mother immediately after the first delivery. They destroy the foetal RBC. Thus thsensitization or activation of memory cells will be prevented in the mother. 3. How is sex determined in human beings? Ans:- 1. Human poduce 23 pair of chromosomes, in which 22 pairs are same in male and female. The sex determinating mechanism in case of humans is XX- XY Type. 2. Male carry 'XY' (heterogametic) and females carry (XX) (Homogametic) chromosomes. During spermatogenesis, two different types of gametes are produced in males. 3. 50% of the total fertilizing sperms carry the 'X'-chromosomes, and the remaining 50% sperm produced carry 'Y'-chromosomes. 4. Thus, males are referred to as heterogametic, i.e. 'XY' (22 pairs of autosomes and XY allosomes (sex chromosomes). 5. Females carry perfect pair of sex chromosomes, i.e. XX-Homogametic (22 pairs of autosomes and XX allosomes (Sex chromosome). 6. If a sperm carrying 'X' fertilizes the ovum with 'X' chromosomes, then the zygote develops into a female offspring.Zoology-II 73 7. If a sperm carrying 'Y' fertilizes the ovum with 'X' chromosomes, then the zygote develops into male off spring. 8. Thus, the sex determination depends on the type of sperm involved in the fertilization. 4. Mention any two autosomal genetic genetic disorders with their symptoms. Ans:- (A) Down's syndrome (Trisomy 21) 1. Down's syndrome is a genetic condition that causes delay in physical and intellectual development. 2. The cause of thin genetic disorder is the presence of on additional copy of the chromosome number 21 (47, XX, +21) 3. The affected indivudal is short statured with small round head, furrowed tongue. Physical, psychomotor and mental development is retarded. (B) Edward's syndrome (Trisomy) 1. Edward's syndrome is a chromosomal abnormality characterized by the presence of an extra copy of gene on 18th chromosome. 2. It occurs in all human population but is more prevalent in the female offspring. 3. People with thin syndrome die majorly during the foetal stage and people who survive have serious defects such as cardiac acnormalities and kidney malfunctions and live only for shorter period. 5. Describe the genetic basis of ABO blood grouping. Ans:-Genetic basis of ABO blood grouping: 1. In human beings, blood groups are controlled mainly by the alleles, IA, IB and IO located on chromosome 9. 2. Allele IA produces type A antigen which is dominant to the IO. Similarly, allel IB produces type B antigen and is dominant to the IO allele. 3. Allele IO does not produce any antigen. The alleles IA and IB are both codominant to each other. IA = IB > IO 4. A child receives any one of the alleles among IA, IB or IO from each parent which results in six genotypes and four phenotypes. IAIA, blood 6. Describe male heterogametry.

Describe the Genic Balance Theory of sex determination. Ans:- According to Bridges, in Drosophila the sex of an individual is deter- mined by the balance between the genes for femaleness located on the X-chromosome and those for maleness located on the autosomes. Hence the sex of an individual is determined by the ratio of number of its X- chromosomes and that of its autosomal sets, the Y-chromosome taking no part it the determination of the sex. The ratio is termed as sex index and is expressed as follows. Sex index = Number of X chromosomes / Number of sets of autosomes (X/A) Bridges studied the offspring resulting from the non-disjunctin of X-chromosome during the meiosis in females. There were various types of gametes such as the ones which contained one exra X-chromosome (AXX) and some others contained one chromosome less (AO). Syngamy of such aberrant gametes and normal as 2n+1, 2n-1 etc. AAXO male is produced when an usual ovum (AO) in the female is fertilized by a sperm with AX chromosome complement. An AAXXY female is produced when an un- usual ovum with AXX and a sperm with AY fuse. Bridges found that the AAXXY flies were fertile females and AAXO flies were sterile males. It is important to note that the presence of Y-chromosome in the AAXXY flies did not cause maleness, and its absence in the AAXO flies did not produce femaleness. When bridges crossed triploid females (AAXXX) with normal dilploid males (AAXY), he obtained normal diploid females, males, triploid females, intersexes, super females and super males. The occurrence of triploid intersexes from such a cross clearly established that autosomes also carry genes for sex determination. Bridges realized that the critical factor in determining sex is the ratio of X chromosomes to the number of haploid sets of autosomes (A) present. He concluded that Y-chromosome in drosophila lacks male determining factor.

Mention any two autosomal genetic disorders with their symptoms. Ans:-Down syndrome: Trisomy of 21st (Karyotype is 47 +21) is called as Down syndrome. The affected individual is short statured with small round head, furrowed tongue and partially open mouth. Physical, psychomotor and mental development is retarded. Edward syndrome: Trisomy of 18th set (Karyotype is 47+18) is called as Edward syndrome. Edward syndrome occurs in all human populations but is more prevalent in the female offspring. The majority of people with the syndrome die during the foetal stage: infants who survive experience serious defects (cardiac abnormalities and kidney malfunction) and commonly for short periods of time. 12. Explain the inheritance of sex influenced characters in human beings. Ans:- Sex influenced genes are the autosomal genes present in both males and females. In sex-influencded inheritance, the genes behave differently in two sexes. The heterozygous genotype may exhibit one phenotype in males and the contrasting one in females. Pattern baldness:- The allele for baldness behaves dominant (B) in males but recessive (b) in females. The amount of thinning of the hair or balding that is observed depends both on genotype and the amount of testosterone exposure. A male who is 'BB' will show severe balding. A female who is 'BB' will also be affected, and usually less severely, with thinning of the hair, rather than total loss. A male who is heterozygous (Bb) will not be affected. Individuals of either sex who are fully recessive (bb) will not affected. If a heterozygous non-bald woman (Bb) Marrys a heterozygous Bald man (Bb)in the offspring the ratio of bald to non-bald in the male progeny is 3:1, while in females it is 1:3. Long Answer Questions 1. What are multiple alleles? Describe multiple alleles with the help of ABO blood groups in man. Ans:- Generally a gene has two alternative alleles. But sometimes a gene may have more than two forms. These are referred to as Multiple alleles. Multiple alleles cannot be observed in a person, but can be observed in a family or population. The inheritance of multiple alleles is called multiple allelism. Number of genotypes from multiple alleles is given by the expression (n +1)/2, where 'n' is the number of alleles. ABO blood groups are the best example for multiple alleles. ABO Blood Groups: Karl Land Steiner observed the ABO blood grouping in human beings. The phenotypes A, B and AB are characterized by the presence of antigens onZoology-II 79 the surface of red blood cells. The pheno- types O are without antigens on the surface of RBCs. These are under the control of a gene located on chromosome nine (9). The four pheno- types of blood groups are due to the antigens A and B. Blood group A has antigen A on the R.B.C and anti B antibody in plasma. Blood group B has antigens B on R.B.C. and anti A antibody in the plasma. Blood group AB has both anti A and anti B on RBCs but no antibodies in the plasma. Blood group O is without any antigens on RBCs but with both anti A antibody and anti B antibody in plasma. Character Group- A Group- B Group- AB Group- O Antigen on RBC Antigen'A''B' Antigen'A' & 'B' Antigen A B absent Antibodies in Plasma Antibody'B' Antibody'A' Absent Antibodies 'A'& 'B' The ABO phenotype of any individual is ascertained by mixing a blood sample with Anti serum containing anti-A or anti-B; If a clump is formed with anti-A the blood is of 'A' type. If the clump is formed with anti-B, the blood is of 'B' type. If the clump is formed with both anti A and anti-B antibodies, the blood is 'AB' type. If no clump is produced with either of the antibodies, the blood is of 'O'type. GENETIC BASIS: Bernstein proposed the genetic basis of ABO blood grouping. The genetic basis of ABO blood grouping is mainly dependent on the three Alleles IA, IB, IO of the gene I. The antigens which are present on RBC are known as isoagglutinogens and antibodies in plasma are known as isoagglutinins. Isoagglutininis are the antibodies of an individual of a species causing agglutination reactions with antigen of another individual of the same species.The alleles IA, IB are mainly responsible for the production of isoagglutinogens. Out of the three alleles IA, IB, IO, the alleles IA and IB are dominant and IO is recessive, when IA,IB are present co-dominance occurs. IA = IB > IO IA & IB alleles dominant to allele IO but both are codominant to each other. 6 genotypes are possible with 3 alleles IA, IB IOIOBasic Learning Material 80 2. Describe chromosomal theory of sex determination. Ans:- The process of sex determination by allosomes is called chromosomal sex determination. If two sex chromosomes are similar (XX), the individual is described as homogametic. Gametes produced from it are similar. If the two sex chromosomes are different (XY) or contains only one sex chromosome (XO), the individual is described as heterogametic. Male heterogamety:- in this method males produce dissimilar gametes while females produce similar gametes. XX-XO type:- In some insects such as bugs, grasshoppers and cockroaches, females are with two X-chromosomes and males are with one X-chromosome in each somatic cell. McClung discovered this type in grass hoppers, the unpaired X-chromosome determines the male sex. The karyotype of the female is AAXX and that of the male is AAXO. All the ova contains AX type of chromosomes and the sperms are of two types. One half of the sperms have AX complement and the other half have 'A' complement of chromosomes. The sex of the offspring depends on the type of sperm that fertilizes the ovum. XX-XY type: Human beings and some insects such as drosophila, bothfemales and males have the same number of chromosomes. The karyotype of the female is AAXX and that of the male is AAXY. Females are hmogametic with 'XX' chromosomes. They produce similar ova having one X-Sex determination in grass hopper chromosome each. Males are 'heterogametic' with X and Y-chromosomes. They Sex determination produce two kinds of sperms: one half of them in Fumea with X-chromosome and the other half with Y-chromosome. The sex of the offspring depends on the fertilizing sperm. Female heterogamety: In this method of sex determination, the males produce 'similar gametes' while females produce 'dissimilar gametes'.AA XXAA XO AXA AX AA XX AA XO Sex Determination in Gross Hopper AA XXAA XY AXAY AX AA XX AA XY Sex Determination in Human BeingZoology-II 81 ZO-ZZ type: In moths and some butterflies, female is heterogametic with one Z-chromosome (ZO) and male is homogametic with two Z-chromosomes (ZZ). The karyotype of female is AAZO and male is AAZZ. Females produce two kinds of ova, half of them with a Z-chromosome and the other half with no sex chromosome. Males produce similar type of sperms. The sex of the offspring depends on the type of ovum that is fertilized. ZW-ZZ type: In birds, reptiles, some fishes, etc, the females are heterogametic with ZW - allosomes and males are homogametic with ZZ- allosomes. The karyotype of female is AAZW and that of the male is AAZZ. All sperms are similar with the allosome - Z. ova are of two different kinds; one half of the ova are with the allosome-Z and the other half with the allosome -W. The sex of the offspring depends on the type of ovum that is fertilized. Sex determination in humans (XX-XY method of Sex Determination): In human beings, both females and males have the same number of chromosomes. Females are homogametic with XX chromosomes. They produce ova having X-chromosomes. All ova are similar. Males are heterogametic with X and Y-chromosomes. They produce two kinds of sperms, half of them with X-chromosome. On fertilization the zygotes may have either the XX or XY. The zygote with XX becomes the female and the zygote with XY becomes the male. In human beings females are homogametic with 44 autosomes and XX-allosomes. Males are hetero- gametic with 44 autosomes and XY-allosomes. All the ova are similar in their karyotype having 23 chromosomes, (22 + X). Sperms also have 23 chromosomes but are of two types. Half of them are with allosome Y (22 + Y). The sex of the off spring depends on the fertilizing sperm. Thus, in each pregnancy there is always 50 percent probability of giving birth to either a male or a female child. 3. What is crisscross inheritance? Explain the inheritance of one sex linked recessive character in human beings. Ans:-Crisscross inheritance: The transmission of a character from father to throughAA ZOAA ZZ AZ AZ ZZ AA ZWBird AW Sex Determination in BirdBasic Learning Material 82 his daughter is called crisscross inheritance. In criss- cross inheritance, the character appears in alternate generation only. The sex linked characters exhibit crisscross inheritance. Crisscross inheritance is also known as skip generation inheritance. Sex linked inheritance: The sex chromosomes carry sex linked genes for some traits that are unrelated to sex characteristics and the inheritance is called sex linked inheritance. While most Y-linked genes help determine sex, the X chromosomes have genes for many characters unrelated to sex. X-linked inheritance: X-linked diseases are mostly recessive and restricted to the males who carry the mutant allele. This is because males have only one X-chromosome, where as females have two. Characters of X-linked Traits: X-linked genes are never passed from father to son. The Y-chromosome is the only sex chromosome that passes from father to son. Males are never carriers-if they have a single mutated gene on the X- chromosome, it will be definitely expressed. Males are termed hemizygous for genes on X-chromosome, females X-linked recessive inheritance: X-linked recessive inheritance is a mode of inheritance in which a mutation in a gene on the X-chromosome because the phenotype to be expressed in males and in the females who are homozygous for the allele. All affected females have an affected father and a carrier or affected mother. Characters of X-linked recessive Traits: Males are much more likely to be affected because they need only one copy of the mutant allele to express the phenotype. Affected males get the disease from their mothers. If a female is homozygous affected, all her sons are affected. Daughters of affected male are either carriers or affected, Affected male pass his X- chromosome to his daughters. X-linked recessive disorders are typically passed on from an affected father to 50% of his grand sons through carrier daughters. The X-linked recessive traits follow crisscross pattern of inheritance. The most common X-linked recessive disorders it is a sex linked recessive disorder. Retina of the eye in man contains the cell sensitive to red and green colours. This called dystrophin. Sex linkage in Drosophila melanogaster 4. Why mega project? Ans:- Human Genome Project (HGP) was called a mega project. It was an in- ternational effort formally begun in October, 1990. Goals of HGP:- Some important goals of HGP were as follows: i. Identify all the approximately 20,000-30,000 genes in human DNA. ii. Determine the sequences of the 3 billion chemical base pairs that make up human DNA. iii. Improve tools for data analysis. iv. Address the ethical, legal, and social issues (ELSI) that may arise from the project. Salient Feature of Human Genome: Some of the salient observations drawn from human genome project are as follows: i. The human genome contains 3164.7 million nucleotide bases. ii. The average gene consists of 3000 bases, but sizes vary greatly, with the largest known human gene being the one that codes for the protein called dystrophin.Basic Learning Material 84 iii. The total number of genes is estimate at 30,000. Almost all (99.9%) nucleotide bases are exactly the same in all people. iv. The functions are unknown for over 50% of the genes discovered. v. Less than 2% of the genome codes for proteins. vi. Repeated sequences make up very large portion of the human genome. vii. Repetitive sequences are stretches of DNA sequences that are repeated many times. They are thought to have no direct coding functions, but they shed light on chromosome structure, dynamics and evolution. viii. Chromosome 1 has the highest number of genes (2,968), and the Y- chromosome has the fewest genes (231). ix. Scientists have identified about 1.4 million locations where single base DNA differences (SNPs- single nucleotide polymorphism pronounced as snips) occur in humans. This information promises to revolutionize the processes of finding chromosomal locations for disease associated sequences and tracing human history. Advantages of HGP: 1. In the area of health care, identification and mapping of the genes responsible for genetic diseases helps in diagnosis, treatment and prevention of these diseases. 2. Detailed knowledge of the genomes of humans and other species will give a clear picture of gene expression, cellular growth and differentiation and evolutionary biology. 3. Earlier detection of genetic predispositions to disease, rational drug design, gene therapy is going to be easy with more knowledge on human genome. 4. A new era of molecular medicine, characterized by looking into the most fundamental causes of disease than treating the symptoms will be an important advantage. 5. What is DNA fingerprinting? Mention its applications. Ans:- No two people (other than identical twins) have exactly the same sequence of bases in their DNA. Restriction Fragment Length Polymorphisms (RFLPs/riflips) are characteristic to every person's DNA. They are called Variable Number Tandem Repeats (VNTRs) and are useful as Genetic markers. The VNTRs of two persons generally show variations. DNA fingerprinting involves identifying differences in some specific regions in DNA sequence called repetitive DNA, because in these sequences, a small stretch of DNA is repeated many times. These sequences show high degree of polymorphism and form the basis of DNA fingerprinting. In 1984 Alec Jeffrys discovered the fundamental techniques involved in fingerprints while studying the gene for myoglobin.Zoology-II 85 DNA Fingerprinting-Protocol 1. Obtaining DNA: the DNA is obtained from blood, saliva, hair roots, semen etc. 2. Fragmenting DNA: with help of restriction endonucleases cut the DNA into smaller fragments at specific sites. 3. Separation of DNA fragments by electrophoresis: DNA fragments are separated by their size by gel electrophoresis method. 4. Denaturing DNA: the DNA on the gel is separated into single strands by breaking of hydrogen bonds. 5. Blotting: By the southern blotting process the DNA strands are trans- ferred on to the nylon membrane by capillary action. 6. Using probes to identify specific DNA: A radioactive probe is added to the DNA bands. The probe is a single stranded DNA molecule that is complementary to the gene of interest in the sample under study. 7. Hybridization with probe: After the probe hybridizes and the excess probe washed off, a photographic film is placed on the membrane containing 'DNA hybrids'. 8. Exposure on film to make a Genetic/ DNA Finger Print: The radioac- tive label exposes to film to form an image (image bonds) corresponding to specific DNA bands. The thick and thin dark bands form a pattern of bars which constitute a genetic fingerprint.

Ans:-Types of Gene therapy:- Two basic types of gene therapy can be applied to humans, germ line and somatic line.Basic Learning Material 94 1)Germ line gene therapy:- In this type of therapy functional genes are introduced into sperms or ova and are thus integrated in to their genomes. Therefore the change or modification becomes heritable. Due to various technical and ethical reasons, the germ line gene therapy re- mained at the 'infant stage' for the time being 2)Somatic line therapy:- In this type of therapy, functional genes are introduced into somatic cells of a patient. The approach is to correct a disease phenotype by treating some somatic cells in the affected person. The changes effected in this type of gene therapy are non-heritable. Somatic line therapy is of two types. (1) ex-vivo cells are modified outside the body and then transplanted back. (2) in-vivo-genes are changed in cells, while they are still inside the body. 13.
