How to Lose Belly Fat What we perceive as belly fat comes from a combination of two factors. One is visceral fat that accumulates with age around the organs in your abdominal region and living a primarily sedentary lifestyle. Two, bloating, often from an imbalance in the gut microbiome accentuates its appearance. To lose belly fat on a holistic level: - Think about the type of calories you consume in relation to physical activity. - Understand where and how you store fat changes as you age: For women, this shift, with the body having more fat than muscle mass, occurs around menopause. Focus more on whole foods, reducing refined carbohydrates and processed foods and feeding your gut microbiome. That's where EastWest Belly Fix comes in. - Increase your physical activity level to better regulate insulin and encourage your liver to utilize fatty acids.

Medical care often treats the symptoms of a condition rather than identifying and addressing the source. This approach is changing and shaping our holistic primary care and family medicine practice. As one significant factor, research has illuminated a relationship between your gut and your holistic health. Particularly, gut inflammation and irritation can contribute to bloating, digestive issues and other chronic health conditions. Belly Fix takes a different approach to digestive health. Traditionally, gut supplements have masked symptoms and temporarily relieved bloating. Belly Fix aims to fuel and feed the digestive microbiome to benefit your health overall: - A functional blend for metabolic support, including amino acids, helps control inflammation, balance bacteria and preserve the gut lining. These aspects help reduce discomfort and improve digestion. - Coconut medium-chain triglycerides assist with helping you feel full and reducing cravings while also improving gut flora. - Bioavailable ingredients like turmeric and ginger further help lessen inflammation and are better absorbed by the body. - Natural probiotics help improve the balance of gut bacteria. - Spirulina and superfood greens, including alfalfa and barley grass, provide micronutrients and chlorophyll to support the body's natural detoxification pathways and deliver digestive support. - Collagen peptides provide targeted amino acids for the health of tight-junction proteins within the lining of the gut. Ingredient Benefits Home to about 1,000 different species of bacteria, your gut is a complicated ecosystem that has a macro effect on your health. Gut bacteria assist with breaking down food, helping your body use essential nutrients, and controlling less-beneficial bacteria. Ideal gut health involves a balance between the two to enhance immunity and lessen damaging inflammation. Gut flora lacking this balance - including an abundance of \"bad\" bacteria or overall decreasing amounts of microorganisms - has been linked with the development of Crohn's disease, ulcerative colitis, irritable bowel disease, high cholesterol, heart disease, chronic kidney disease, and other inflammatory conditions. An imbalance may also alter the brain-gut relationship, influencing your senses, mood, and ability to feel full. As more information about the effects of your gut on your overall health emerges, you're recommended to feed the microbiome through prebiotics \u2014 or plant fibers typically obtained through fruits, vegetables, and other complex carbohydrates \u2014 and probiotics, which contribute to the gut's microbiome. These live organisms can be found naturally in various fermented foods. Considering this relationship, the EastWest Belly Fix supplement addresses your gut health through the following: Coconut MCT (Medium Chain Triglyceride) Oil Powder With a unique molecular length, Coconut MCT (Medium Chain Triglyceride) Oil Powder is quickly absorbed by the body and allocated toward energy while bypassing the enzymatic activity needed to stimulate the body's cells.(1) MCTs have a thermogenic effect on the liver, aiding how the body uses fats and reducing potential cravings. In terms of gut health, these natural fatty acids support the balance of gut bacteria and processes related to metabolism and energy. Digestive Blend Including turmeric rhizome, ginger root, and yeast (saccharomyces boulardii), Belly Fix is a complete digestive powerhouse that harnesses the increased bioavailability of turmeric and ginger.(2) Helping reduce inflammation in the gut, turmeric has been shown to support the digestive microbiome, intestinal integrity, and the health of tight-junction proteins, which play a role in the development of intestinal hyperpermeability or \"leaky gut.\" (3) Ginger and its phenolic compounds, 6-Gingerol and 6-Shoagal, aid digestive emptying and help lessen bloating. (4) Both substances help regulate the digestive system's inflammatory response. Collagen Peptides The Western diet is low in bovine collagen peptides, which supply amino acids to the body's connective tissue, including the gut. Collagen matrices are key for tissue elasticity, flexibility, and hydration. Collagen is naturally high in amino acids glycine, proline, and glutamine, which maintain specialized functions in the body, such as building healthy DNA strands and promoting the integrity of the intestinal lining. (5) Additional L-Glutamine supports continued collagen production in the gut to maintain a healthy intestinal lining. (6) Grass Blend Barley, oat, and alfalfa grasses are rich in phytonutrients, including the flavonoid tricin. These nutrients play a role in the normal relaxation of smooth muscle in the gut and help improve gut comfort. Greens contain an impressive spectrum of alkalizing enzymes and vitamins, including vitamin K, vitamin C, and folate. Cereal greens also contain phytonutrients like chlorophyll, which is known to aid natural detoxification. Supported by over 2,000 published articles, spirulina is a blue-green algae superfood containing amino acids that support normal digestive function and the health of immune cells and provide rich vitamin and mineral content.
