Wher- ever they show up, they attract the curiosity and admiration of the public. On television, we see them fl oating through a space station; we see them exercising, eating and working outside the sta- tion attaching or xing something. Sometimes they are stationed in front of a console, pulling a drawer or pushing a button, but frankly, we do not have any idea what they are doing there or what is happening inside those racks. This Special Presentation of Sci- enti c American , devoted to life and physical sciences research in space, is meant to help remedy this de ciency. My own eld is space plasma physics. I have been engaged in experiments exploiting the elec- tromagnetic forces of near-Earth space acting on arti cially inject- ed plasma clouds. These experi- ments are very different from the research discussed in this publica- tion. Here one exploits the near- weightless (microgravity) conditions found in orbit- al fl ight to study the behaviour of physical and bio- logical systems in the absence of the effects of gravity. The use of microgravity is what makes this research unique compared with the more classic space sciences of plasma and solar physics, astrono- my and the planetary sciences. As a former Chairman of the European Space Sci- ence Committee of the European Science Founda- tion, I have had the privilege of being able to survey the whole gamut of European space sciences and consequently been able to gauge for myself its strengths and weaknesses. In the course of this, I gradually became familiar with the work of Euro- pean scientists in the microgravity and related elds. What struck me rst was the enormous range of sci-enti c areas involved, such as crystal growth, alloy formation, soft matter physics, the wide eld of fl uid sciences, relativity physics, the highly important eld of human and plant physiology and nally the fundamental studies of the behaviour and survival of biological systems at the cellular level, not only under microgravity, but also under exposure to the harsh space environment. As I acquainted myself with this research, I also came to realise how in recent years this work had acquired the mantle of top-class science, yet had not received the exposure at the popular science level that I felt it deserved. As Chairman of the Advisory Com- mittee on Human Spacefl ight, Mi- crogravity and Exploration of the European Space Agency (ESA), I was therefore highly gratified when Scienti c American agreed to produce a Special Presentation devoted to this work by European scientists, often in collaboration with scientists from other countries. Having seen the highly informative articles that have resulted along with the ne and captivating art- work and the excellent editorial work of Scienti c American , I can only wholeheartedly recommend this highly readable Special Presentation entitled \"Looking Up: Europe's Quiet Revolution in Micro- gravity Research\" to anyone seeking a deeper under- s tan din g o f thi s f a s c in a t in g ar e a o f s c i e n t i fi c research.

Clearly, plants \"sense\" gravity, but how? Years of research in gravitational biology have yielded some remarkable new insights\u2014and striking Europe's Quiet Revolution in Microgravity ResearchFifteen years ago or so, I had the oc- casion to step out of a perfectly good airplane while it was two and a half miles in the air. You have no doubt correctly surmised that I was wearing a parachute, for which I seem to recall being extremely grateful at the time. Between the alternating waves of terror and exhil- aration, as I found myself falling faster and farther than I ever had before, I had plenty of opportunity to appreciate a pro- found truth: gravity rules our lives in ways we often take for granted. Strangely enough, gravity is the weak- est force in the universe. True, it can feel powerful when you are, say, skydiving or struggling to push a stalled car uphill, and the fact that it holds together solar sys-tems and galaxies lends it dramatic fl air. Nevertheless, compared to the other fun- damental forces of nature\u2014electromag- netism and the two nuclear ones that bind atomic nuclei\u2014gravity is a piker. Every time you take a step, you move your body easily against the gravitational tug of the entire Earth. Gravity just seems strong be- cause its force never self-negates over dis- tance in the way that the positive and negative poles of electromagnetism do. Thus we experience gravity everywhere, which for centuries impeded our ability to conduct experiments aimed at better un- derstanding it. That has changed, thanks to modern technology. We can now send people and instruments into space to study weight- less, free-fall environments. Scientists are discovering precisely how gravity shapes the structure of various materials, includ- ing the tissues that make up our own bod-ies, and how it is involved in the complex dynamics of fl owing fl uids at larger and smaller scales. As the human race contin- ues its exploration of space, and possibly even its eventual colonisation of it, we will need to know what life outside our familiar 1g means. The articles in this collection provide a wonderful overview of such scienti c ex- plorations into microgravity and related phenomena, and I hope you will enjoy them. Your feet may stay planted on the ground but you are still in for an exciting intellectual trip. Geronimo!

NASANASANASANASANNNNNNN IImaIma Ima gesgesges BY THOMAS 6 LOOKING Quiet Revolution in Microgravity ResearchI always experience d\u00e9j\u00e0 vu when telling children of my adven- tures in space. I remember myself as I watched Neil Armstrong walking on the moon and decided, \"Yes, that is what I want to do.\" Not that there were many obvious and immediate chances for Europeans to become astronauts. Building a suitable background by studying aerospace technology and getting into aviation came rst, and then when the opportunity actually came, I didn't have to think for a second about what my answer would be. I am often asked why I took on such a risky life. For me, the bene ts of a career in spacefl ight de nitely outweigh the risks\u2014 and those bene ts include not only the scienti c knowledge gained from our experiments, but also the cultural and personal rewards. I believe people are inherently curious, and this desire to explore the unknown is something I very much feel and follow. To me, exploration is worth the risks. With the International Space Station nearing completion, all of the agencies involved in the ISS programme are looking for- ward to the moment when we can really utilise the station and all the capabilities of its multifunctional research laboratory. People want to know about life in orbit. Having experienced six months on Mir as well as a long mission on the ISS, I can say there is a general similarity in the daily routine. There are many differences, however, between the two stations. Everything is much more advanced aboard the ISS, much more modern. In- side we have quite a bit more space than we had on Mir. We now have two Mission Control Centres we can talk to, and we can talk to them almost 24 hours a day. On Mir we could talk to the Russian control centre only at certain times. Last but not least, from a personal point of view, the food has become a bit more international. We have more items we can choose from, which becomes quite important if you are staying on the station for a long time. One advantage of having several people on board the station is that all astronauts work together to increase the station's sci- enti c output. With more people, we have more time to perform the scienti c programme. Opportunities will continue to arise to install new scienti c hardware both internally and externally, and the operational capabilities of the station will be expanded even further in the future. Of course, it is always the objective of each crew member to maintain the station ef ciently so that it can run as smoothly as possible. During my mission on the ISS, we took part in an experiment called the Materials ISS Experiment or MISSE. We installed two platforms containing some speci c materials that would then be exposed to the conditions of low Earth orbit. These platforms will be retrieved later, when they will be examined to see how this environment affects these materials. We also installed a so- called fl oating point measurement unit, which is a scienti c de- vice on the S1 truss segment. Finally we set up one technology experiment that will use an infrared camera on future shuttle fl ights to determine any defects on the exterior of the shuttle. Most of the experiments on board are from the areas of life sci- ences, biology, physics, astrophysics and technology. So a pretty wide band of science is covered. One interesting physics experiment involves plasma crystalli- sation. A plasma is generated, dust particles are injected and then those particles inside the plasma behave like molecules in a crys-tal. A very new area of research, these results will be important in different areas of fl uid physics, solid-state physics as well as other areas. In fact, we ran this experiment not only once but repeated it during the mission. For the life sciences, we carried out investigations related to the human vestibular system, the cardio- pulmonary system and the skeleton; and in biology we performed an experiment related to the generation of protein crystals. Our research in life science serves two purposes: rst, to bet- ter understand certain diseases that exist here on Earth and help to nd cures for them; and second, in view of the continuing ex- ploration of space, to prepare us for long-duration missions in future decades, maybe to our neighbour planet Mars. Before we attempt to travel that distance, we de nitely need to understand how to counteract the effects of weightlessness. Speaking of which, we astronauts are always asked about liv- ing in a weightless environment. It's indeed true that when you get into space, the perception of weightlessness is simply very, very nice. It's a unique feeling not to perceive the weight of your own body, to fl oat around and to use the whole space inside the station. You can work on the fl oor or on the ceiling without any difference. However, the drawback is you don't use your muscles Life in Orbit The personal and professional rewards of space exploration PERSPECTIVES ESAas much in space as you use them here on the ground\u2014even when we are only sitting up, we still have to exercise some muscle con- trol to hold ourselves up against gravity. Of course, when we are walking or standing, we use them even more. This is not the case in weightlessness, however, where we lose muscle mass with lack of use. Weightlessness also has a similar negative effect on bones. Our bones immediately start to lose calcium once we get into orbit, which makes bones more brittle. In addition, the weight-less conditions combined with cosmic radiation affects the cen- tral nervous system and immune system. How and why these effects occur needs to be better understood. As you can see, the ISS is not just a \"plaything\" in space; nor is it an expensive \"white elephant.\" It is an essential part of the human endeavour to seek greater knowledge of the universe as well as to take advantage of microgravity to nd a better under- standing of how gravity affects on our life on Earth. www.spacefl ight.esa.int 7 8 LOOKING UP: Europe's Quiet Revolution in Microgravity Research Can organisms be transported fr om one planet to another and survive both space conditions and atmospheric entry to impregnate the host planet with new forms of life? Scientists explore whether Earth was colonised by microscopic hitchhikers. By Frances Westall and Rosa de la Torre NoetzelMETEORITES: STONES WITH STOWAWAYS? In the summer of 1996, the equivalent of an earthquake shook the scien- ti c world. David McKay of the Johnson Space Centre (JSC) in Hous- ton, Texas, and his colleagues announced in the lay press and in a scien- ti c paper published in the prestigious journal Science that they had found traces of Martian life in a meteorite from Mars. This announcement led to a spate of rebuttals, confrontations, and new studies, as well as provided an incredible stimulus to Mars research\u2014in particular, the search for life on Mars. Why from Mars? It was only when 1.3 billion-year-old meteorites of volcanic rock were found that scientists realised they must therefore have come from a geolog- ically active body. Analysis showed that these meteorites contained trapped gases identical to those in the Martian atmosphere. The rocks had been ejected from the surface of Mars when some large body of matter crashed into the planet. They then went into orbit around the sun for several mil-lion years before falling to Earth. More than 10 years after their initial announcement, the JSC team still maintains that they have evidence for life (although they have had to back down on a number of their original lines of evidence) ... and the rebuttals con- tinue. The present situation is a stalemate, and we probably won't know if there is or was life on Mars until we get the RIGHT rock back from Mars. SPACE CHANNEL / PHIL SAUNDERSAT A GLANCE Microorganisms can live in very diverse environments, including cracks in volcanic rocks. Their ability to survive begs two questions: was there ever life on Mars, and could microbes have been carried to Earth on meteorites? Using a space capsule to create arti cial meteorites, scientists placed sedimentary rocks in sam-ple holders on the heat shield to test if they would survive atmo-spheric re-entry. Some rock samples survived and developed the dark fusion crust typical of real meteorites, but mi-croorganisms have not yet made it through ASTROBIOLOGY NASA / JPL-CALTECH (Asteroid); SPACE CHANNEL / PHIL SAUNDERS; ESA (FOTON capsule) 12 3Microbes, Please\u2014 On the Rocks The rock that McKay and his group are still analysing in painstaking detail is the equivalent of terrestrial basalt, a volcanic rock. In fact, all the meteorites from Mars (38 have been identi- ed to date) are igneous rocks, which are rocks that have consolidated from magma, molten rock ejected during volcanic eruptions. Since the 1996 announcement and the blos- soming of astrobiology (the search for the origin and existence of life in the universe), numerous investigations have shown that microbes can live in the most diverse habitats and environments, including cracks in cooled volcanic rocks. How- ever, evidence against McKay and colleagues hardened when it was discovered that his rock formed about 4.5 billion years ago when the planet of Mars rst consolidated. How could such an ancient rock contain traces of life when the planet had only just condensed? It later turned out that the minerals lling the cracks in the rock where the supposed microbi- al traces were found were deposited by low tem- perature fl uids some 3.9 billion years ago. This was a period when Mars had signi cant quanti- ties of water on its surface and when its surface was habitable. Later (between 3.8 and 3.5 bil- lion years ago) the surface of Mars became hos- tile to life; however, life may still survive in the subsurface. No Stone Unturned In the same year that McKay was making his announcement, Ren\u00e9 Demets, project scientist for space biology at the European Space Martian meteorite ALH 84001 (full name Allan Hills 84001) was found in 1984 in Allan Hills, Antarctica, by US meteorite hunters. Al-though it appears absolutely nor-mal with 80% of its surface cov-ered by the standard dark fusion crust, this meteorite made head-lines in 1996 when scientists an-nounced it contained traces of life\u2014a claim still hotly debated. A Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy A meteorite's journey from Mars to Earth was long and violent. First, an asteroid or other large body crashed into the Martian surface with enough force to eject chunks of the planet into space. After orbiting the sun for millions of years, these Martian meteorites then survived the heat of atmospheric entry to nally land on Earth. Mars Earth www.spacefl ight.esa.int 11 Research and Technology Centre (ESTEC), the technical heart of the European Space Agency, developed a plan with Andr\u00e9 Brack at the CNRS in France. Was there a way to nd out more a bout what might survive a journey through the Earth's atmosphere without waiting for another suitable Martian meteorite to land? Their solu- tion: to expose mineral samples to the environ- ment created on the heat shield of a recoverable Foton capsule (a Russian spacecraft) when it re- entered the Earth's atmosphere. ESA scientists had used the unmanned Russian Foton cap- sule's heat shield to test materials before, but never in the name of astrobiological research. This growing interest in Europe in astrobiol- ogy led to a completely new series of experi- ments: the Stone series. The objective was, and is, to test the ability of different types of sedi-mentary rocks with a similar composition to those found on Mars (such as sandstone) to sur- vive during entry into the Earth's atmosphere. As the experiments progressed, however, this goal has broadened to look at the wider possibil- ity of microorganisms being carried between planets. On the right, \"A History Set in Stone\" gives a brief overview of the early Stone experi- ments 1-4, while this article concentrates on the two most recent experiments, Stone 5 and 6. Stone 5 Led again by Andr\u00e9 Brack, Stone 5 was launched i n 2005 and proved a great success. Four rocks were embedded in the heat shield of a Foton 12 capsule around the point where the spacecraft is subjected to the highest heat stress upon atmospheric entry. An illustration of the Russian Foton capsule used to simulate atmospheric entry. Sedimentary rocks were placed on the heat shield, sent into space and then brought back to Earth to test their ability to survive a journey through our atmosphere.A HISTORY SET IN STONE The series of Stone fl ights began in 1999. Their objective was to simulate a meteorite entry into the Earth's atmosphere by plac-ing sedimentary rocks in sample holders on the heat shield of the unmanned Foton Russian space-craft. Upon the craft's return to Earth, these \"arti cial meteors\" would then be recovered and analysed. STONE 1 Launched 1999 with 3 rocks placed on heat shield Control sample: Dolerite, a basalt with similar characteristics to stony meteors (formation of a black fusion crust con rms that re-entry speed was high enough to melt rock, as with real meteors) Natural sediment: Carbonate sediment and mixed basalt Arti cial sediment: Basalt and gypsum created to simulate Martian sediment Results Control sample lost during fl ight Two test samples showed alteration due to high temperature; They produced CO 2 and calcium oxide;Neither had a fusion crust Loss of the control rock meant that the speed of re-entry could not be proved STONE 2 Crash landed\u2014rocks not recovered STONE 3 Not fl own STONE 4 Exploded after launch12 LOOKING UP: Europe's Quiet Revolution in Microgravity ResearchOne rock was the same type of igneous vol- canic rock as a real meteorite\u2014basalt\u2014to act as a control. One of the most characteristic fea- tures of stony meteorites is their dark-coloured fusion crust of molten rock, which is created by the intense heat of atmospheric entry. If a fusion crust formed on the basalt sample, that would mean that the temperatures endured during at- mospheric entry were high enough to melt the rock and thus the similarity with real meteorites would be validated. The basalt control sample came back with a very acceptable fusion crust, showing that the speed of re-entry at 7.6 km/sec provoked a suf ciently high temperature to melt the exterior of the rock. All four rocks in this experiment survived at- mospheric entry. Apart from the basalt, they in- cluded two sediments: a dolomite (limestone rich in magnesium carbonate) and a sandstone (quartz sand cemented by calcium carbonate). The fourth rock was rather unusual; it was an impactite, which is a rock that has been impact- ed by a previous meteorite as it hit the ground. It was brought from the Haughton Impact Cra-We probably won't know if there is or was life on Mars until we get the RIGHT rock back from Mars.

These rocks tend to be very porous because they melt during impact and the intense heat causes their components to alter, during which gases are liberated (a process called de- volatilisation). Such rocks would be common on the surface of Mars. To test the heat sensed during atmospheric entry, Gabriel Bourrat of the University of Lau- sanne in Switzerland ingeniously placed ther- mic probes consisting of minerals that melt at speci c temperatures inside the dolomite. Based on which materials melted within the dolomite rock, temperatures went beyond 271\u00b0C but not a s high as 630\u00b0C. In addition, a fusion crust did form on the surface of the dolomite (in contrast to Stone 1, see \"A History Set in Stone,\" page 11), which corroborated the result of the forma- tion of fusion crust on the basalt and indicated that these experiments did simulate meteorite entry, despite the lower entry speeds. Earth \"Impregnated\" with Life? Another aspect of the Stone 5 experiment was of particular relevance for astrobiology. The experiment addressed not only the survivability of rocks but also the survivability of living organisms within or on the stones, a concept called \"panspermia,\" which poses the question: \"Can organisms be transported from one plan- etary body to another and survive both space conditions and atmospheric entry to impreg- nate the host planet with new forms of life?\" The idea of microorganisms living in rocks (called endolithic microorganisms) is not unusu- al\u2014volcanic rocks can be an excellent source of nutrients for certain types of microorganisms. One type of endolithic microorganism can live under the surface of a (relatively) transpar- ent rock and uses sunlight to produce energy. Called Chroococcidiopsis , their rocky habitat protects them from the intense harmful UV ra- diation that is found at both the North and South poles, where these types of organisms are often found. The porous impactites described a bove are also ideal habitats for such organisms, and the surface of the porous rock used in Stone 5 was soaked in a solution containing the spores of this type of endolithic bacterium. Further- more, all the rocks carried a mix of different mi- croorganisms, endolithic bacteria and fungi that had been placed inside tiny holes drilled into the back of each 1-cm thick rock sample. The idea to test the hypothesis of pansperm- ia was good, but unfortunately, the microor-ganisms did not survive entry into the atmo- sphere. Those on the surface of the impactite disappeared as the surface was vaporised (ab- lated) during entry, and those in the holes in the backs of the rocks were killed by the intense heat of entry. Two lessons were learned here. The rst is that ve millimetres of rock cover are not suf cient to protect the microorganisms from the intense heat produced during atmo- spheric entry. The second is that the origin of the photosynthetic\u2014that is sunshine-using\u2014 microorganisms on Earth had to have been a terrestrial phenomenon because such microor- ganisms that live close to the rock surface can- not survive atmospheric entry. Ultraviolet-Resistant Plants The same Foton capsule that carried Stone also carried another experiment called Lichens designed to test the panspermia hypothesis. Attached to the capsule was a canister, Biopan 5, which opened once the capsule had reached the required altitude to expose its contents to the harsh conditions of space. Within the canister were live lichens that were exposed for 16 days to full solar and cosmic radiation as well as extreme dryness due to the vacuum conditions of space. Lichens are not single organisms; they consist of a fungal element and either photosyn- thesising bacteria or algae that live together in a symbiotic relationship. Lichens are extremely resistant to UV radiation and can survive at high altitudes above 2000 metres where no other plants can survive; and like the endolithic pho- tosynthetic bacteria of the Stone 5 experiment, they can also live at high latitudes in the Polar regions. They were used as a test case in this experiment because of their UV resistance. Despite their known resistance to UV radia- tion, it was still a surprise to discover that, after 16 days of exposure to space conditions and harsh UV radiation, all the lichens showed the same photosynthetic activity after the fl ight as before exposure to space. The team wondered if, however, there had been some subtle damage to the microbial cells as a result of this exposure. They proceeded to make minute microscopic studies of the cells with powerful electron micro-scopes but could still detect no signs of degrada- tion. It was only when they used a simple biolog- ical test called a live/dead test, which can differ- entiate the number of live cells compared to dead ones, that they were able to detect the slightest sign that there were, not surprisingly, more dead cells after the fl ight than before. 14 LOOKING UP: Europe's Quiet Revolution in Microgravity ResearchTo Boldly Go Where Others Cannot The sheer resistance of the fungi to space radia- tion, a condition lethal to bacteria and other microorganisms, is astounding. How do they survive? It seems that the thick outer coating around the lichens, their cortex, provides them with adequate protection against solar radia- tion, at least for 16 days. The lichens had yet another story to tell after their space trip. Space is a high vacuum envi- ronment and any matter containing water, such as microorganisms, are subject to an extreme degree of moisture loss called desiccation . The l ichens were no exception. However, 24 hours after returning to Earth and in the presence of water, the lichens recovered their full metabol- ic activity. T he Stone 5 and the Biopan 5 experiments provided interesting information regarding the survivability of microorganisms in space, but they also highlighted the dif culty of returning the microorganisms alive into the Earth's atmo- sphere. Stone also con rmed, once again, that sedimentary meteorites can survive atmospher- ic entry. However, it left us wondering about the types of sediments that can resist the trauma of entering the atmosphere and if it were possible for microbes that could survive space condi- tions to get though this barrier alive. Stone 6 Another experiment, Stone 6, (led by author Frances Westall) was designed to address these out standing questions. Apart from the basalt control, one type of sediment used as a poten- tial Martian meteorite was volcanic sandstone dating from an epoch on Earth when there was still water on Mars and the possibility that life could exist at its surface. This 3.5 billion-year-old volcanic sandstone from the Pilbara in Australia was deposited in environmental conditions that were similar to those of early Mars, conditions that are consid- ered extreme by present day standards (no oxy- gen, no ozone layer to protect the surface from harmful UV radiation, much volcanic and hy- drothermal activity and many impacts from as- teroids, meteorites and comets). This sounds like a catastrophic scenario but it was on this early planet Earth (and maybe on Mars) that life appeared and thrived. Traces of this early life occur in fossil form in the volcanic sands that hardened into rock. Given the similarities in the early environments of Mars and the Earth, we hypothesised that these ancient Earth sedi- ments with their traces of fossil life would be ideal analogues for Martian rocks from its \"warmer and wetter\" Noachian period some 4.5 to 3.5 billion years ago. Another rock that \"fl ew\" as part of Stone 6 was a piece of ancient lake sediment, about 400 million years old from the Orkney Islands off Scotland. The intriguing aspect of this rock is that it is rich in the organic remains of life forms that lived in and around the lake. These remains are the molecules of the degraded components of the dead organisms. W e wanted to test whether this type of sediment containing only the molecular organic remains of life could make the ultimate test, survival of entry into Earth's atmosphere, had it indeed made the journey from Mars. The last rock in the collection was a piece of granite from the mountains of Spain that was injected with lichens and placed on the heat shield of the Foton capsule to see rst whether they survived in space, and then whether they could survive atmospheric entry as well. This would be the ultimate step in the panspermia hypothesis. Just to make sure that these mi- crobes really did thrive well in space, a variety of lichen species communities and endolithic bacteria were placed in another Biopan canister for inclusion in the same experimental fl ight. In addition, Stone 6 built on the lessons learned from Stone 5 where the rocks had not been thick enough to protect the microbes dur- ing atmosphere re-entry. For this experiment, we engineered thicker 2-cm \"chariots\" for our microscopic hitchhikers that were representa- tive of the type of rock on Mars at the time in question. Endolithic bacteria were placed on the rear of the rocks. Back on Earth Although the basalt rock sample was lost, the others had survived. The 3.5 billion-year-old reconstituted volcanic sandstone from Australia had lost 12 millimetres in thickness but had gained a respectable fusion crust, albeit a creamy colour, unlike the dark fusion crusts of the basalts. Chemical changes in the space cement used in the reconstitution of this rock proved that the temperatures during entry were in excess of 1700\u00b0C. The lake sediment full of the molecular organic remains of living organisms had turned into a rather un-appetising green glassy mess, but it had also partially survived.

Obviously t wo centimetres of rock thickness are still not suf cient to protect the microorganisms; or it may simply be that the blazing heat during en- try penetrates behind the sample holder to scorch any living cell. We may have to nd an- other experimental con guration to test re-en- try survival of microorganisms. What about the lichens? Well, as with the pri- or Biopan experiment, the and photosyn- thetic cyanobacteria in the Biopan container eas- ily survived space conditions at 300 kilometres above the Earth for 12 days. Within three days of rehydration and re-activation, they showed the same levels of photosynthetic behaviour as before the experiment. Unfortunately the lichens in the protective layer of granite exposed on the heat shield of the Foton capsule did not survive, a nd all that remained of the granite were some pieces of molten rock turned into glass. So, the exposed living organisms did not survive entry i nto Earth's atmosphere, even when protected by two centimetres of rock. What about the fossil microorganisms? This study is still in progress but the preliminary observations are very encouraging. Answers, and More Questions The Stone and Biopan experiments have provid- ed us with some of the answers we seek. Yes, sed- imentary rocks can survive atmospheric entry as meteorites. Unlike basalt, however, they do not form dark fusion crusts. Both the dolomite from Stone 5 and the 3.5 billion-year-old silici ed vol- canic sand from Australia from Stone 6 produced creamy-coloured fusion crusts\u2014not ideal when searching for meteorites on the Antarctic ice or in sandy deserts. So, sedimentary meteorites will be challenging to find and identify. When it comes to living microbes being transported from one planet to another inside or outside rocks, this appears to be more of a problem. Whereas micro- organisms like lichens can survive space condi- tions (for 16 days at least), neither they nor endo- lithic microorganisms can survive entry into the Earth's atmosphere, at least not when protected by only two centimetres of rock.

The heart and nervous system must counteract this effect to ensure adequate blood supply and consistent blood pressure. Studies of astronauts have shown a decrease in blood pressure in near-weight-less conditions. Though multiple causes are likely, this decrease has been partly attributed to dilation in the peripher-al arteries, which indicates a relaxed cardiac state. Strangely, the sympathetic nervous system also shows increased activity in space, which is contradictory to a resting state. \u2014The EditorsHUMAN HEALTH Many of us have been told to lose weight to lower our blood pressure, but going weightless? Studies of astronauts show that gravity does contribute to cardiovascular stress. By Peter Norsk and John M. Karemaker In this age of heightened health concerns, most people are acutely aware of their salt and fat intake, and the effect of modern lifestyle on blood pressure. One factor that also affects circulation but that doesn't often register, as it is\u2014for the most part\u2014an unchangeable constant, is gravity. When we are standing, walking or even sitting upright, an ap- preciable amount of blood settles in the lower parts of the body: the abdomen, buttocks and legs. If the body were not able to counteract these effects and ensure that the brain and other or- gans were suf ciently supplied with blood at all times regardless of body position, we would be unable to stand or sit upright. It is our central nervous system which provides control over blood pressure ( see Figure 1 ). If you've ever witnessed someone faint dead away from a standing position, this startling occurrence is the result of a fail- ure in the blood pressure control system. In such a case, the force of gravity is strong enough to overpower the free-fl ow of blood. The most ef cient life saving procedure in this case is to place the sufferer immediately in a horizontal position so that blood can again fl ow more freely back to the heart and hence to the brain. In the near-weightless conditions of space, gravitational stress is absent. Because gravity is not pulling fl uids into the lower ar- eas of the body, these fl uids are distributed into the upper areas of the torso more than is usual on Earth. Blood moves more free- ly from the lower to the upper parts of the body, (over-) lling the heart and lungs and straightening out the facial wrinkles that the astronauts developed over years on Earth. This is what the astro- nauts call \"puffy face and chicken legs\" syndrome. Does Gravity Affect Blood Pressure? How does the everyday stress of gravity affect blood pressure and fl uid volume control in the human body? Studies have shown that blood pressure and fl uid volume control are sensitive to changes in gravitational stress. This background became the basis for experiments that took advantage of the weightless conditions on the International Space Station to look at how gravity on Earth SPACE CHANNEL / PHIL SAUNDERS www.spacefl ight.esa.int 17 Counteracting HYPERTENSION with Weightlessness?18 LOOKING UP: Europe's Quiet Revolution in Microgravity Research SPACE CHANNEL / PHIL SAUNDERSinfl uences human blood pressure control as well as shed light on the integrated systems involved in blood pressure regulation. The results have been surprising and in some cases appear to contradict the expected respons- es. While they have provided a greater under- standing of the effects of gravity on blood pres- sure control, they have raised other questions surrounding fluid volume control and endo- crine responses. Continued research to nd the answers to these and other questions could someday indirectly contribute to the develop- ment of therapies for high blood pressure, or hy- pertension, here on Earth. Blood Pressure on Earth In basic terms, blood pressure refers to the force exerted by circulating blood on the walls of blood vessels. The workhorse muscle of the heart pumps the blood from its ventricles through the arteries to all peripheral tissues of the body, where it feeds the tissues and then returns to the heart through the veins. The heart and all the interconnected vessels are dynamic and work in unison for ef cient transportation of blood. When we are upright on Earth, the heart beats faster than when we are lying down, and the small peripheral blood vessels (small arter- ies or arterioles) in skin, fat, muscles and gastro-intestinal organs are more contracted. This con- traction increases the vascular resistance and compensates for a decreased cardiac output\u2014 the volume of blood pumped away from the heart by the ventricles. In this way, blood pres- sure at the level of the heart is unchanged or even increased despite the drag of gravity on the blood column. Nervous Responses A fast-responding nervous control system is responsible for any acute adjustment of blood pressure that becomes necessary when we are upright, when we exercise or when we change posture or position. The control system consists of a network of blood pressure sensors FIGURE 1. GRAVITY AND BLOOD PRESSURE When upright, gravity drags blood toward the lower parts of the body. This is counteracted by the blood pressure refl ex system, which acts through nervous connections to acceler- ate the heart rate and constrict the small arterial resistance vessels. Values on the left of the gure indicate the variation in blood pressure from head to feet as caused by the gravity-induced hydrostatic pressure gradients. Heart Rate Vasoconstriction60 mm Hg 100 mm Hg 200 mm Hg www.spacefl ight.esa.int 19SPACE CHANNEL / PHIL SAUNDERS in the upper chambers of the heart (the atria), in the main artery (the aorta) and in the arter-ies in the neck just below the base of the skull (see Figure 2 ). Placing the ngers on the peripheral arteries allows us to feel the pulse, or the rhythm of the heart beat. When the pulse pressure is reduced or the mean blood pressure drops, a fl urry of neural signalling occurs. First, the intensity of nerve signals from the arterial pressure sensors to the central nervous system decreases. In re- sponse, the cardiovascular centre in the brain stem communicates back to the heart through the vagus nerve, which is responsible for heart rate among other things. The function of the va- gus nerve is to restrain the nervous activity in the heart, to \"put on the brakes.\" In this case, the message from the brain orders the vagus to re- lease the brake, thereby increasing heart rate and simultaneously unleashing activity in the sympa- thetic nerves. If the vagus nerve acts as the brake, the sym- pathetic nerves act as the accelerator. They strengthen each cardiac contraction and con-strict the small arterial resistance vessels throughout the body. When stimulated, these nerves help the body to counter stress by in- creasing heart rate and decreasing blood fl ow to the skin, muscles and gastrointestinal organs. This refl ex system functions quickly to keep blood pressure within strict limits around a given mean pressure, which is primarily set by the amount of fl uid in the body and thus blood in circulation. The kidneys, then, play a domi- nant role in long-term blood pressure regulation because they regulate body fluid volume by ltering and excreting water and minerals, pro- vided that intake of salt and water is not restricted.FIGURE 2. BARORECEPTORS Blood pressure sensors (barore- ceptors) to counteract the effects of gravity on blood pressure are located in the large central artery, the aorta and the two neck arteries just below the base of the skull. Whenever these sensors are stretched or relaxed by changes in blood pressure, nervous signals are transmitted to the central ner-vous system, which communicates with the heart and peripheral arterial resistance vessels. FIGURE 3. SIX DEGREES OF RELAXATION During an experiment to test the effects of decreasing gravitational stress on the body, beds are tilted head down at a -6o angle. To maintain this position at all times, test sub- jects are transported to the various test laboratory settings on stretchers that are adapted for the occasion.Central Nervous System 6Decreased Gravitational Stress To understand how the stress of gravity affects blood pressure in humans, controlled, long- term bedrest is a useful investigational model to study what happens when that stress is reduced. If gravity does stress the cardiovascu- lar system and increases blood pressure, one would expect that a long-term decrease in grav- itational stress would decrease it. There are indications that this theory holds true. Seven healthy men consented to six weeks of bedrest, where the beds were tilted head down at a 6\u00ba angle to simulate the fl uid shifts experienced under weightless conditions ( see Figure 3 ). During the experiment, mean blood 20 LOOKING UP: Europe's Quiet Revolution in Microgravity Research ESApressure at heart level decreased during the day compared with a control period of normal bodi- ly ac tivity before and after bedrest. Interesting- ly, the hypotensive effect was maintained at the same level from the rst week of bedrest until the 38th day. Thus, giving the body periods of reprieve from holding itself erect leads to lower blood pressure than that seen when the body normally remains upright. Researchers also ob- served that the output of blood from the heart seemed almost unchanged; so they deduced that this decrease in blood pressure was primarily caused by dilation of the smaller blood vessels, decreasing the resistance against which the heart pumps. So can we blame high blood pressure on good posture? Maybe not, but these observa- tions indicate that the daily stress of gravity does raise blood pressure. Gravity thus partici- pates to some degree in setting blood pressure at heart level in humans. Weightless Equals Stress-less The weightless conditions in space offer a unique chance to observe how gravity modu- lates human physiology because gravitational stress is totally abolished. During simulation experiments on the ground, the gravitational load can be minimized but not nulli ed. Head- down bedrest can decrease the effects of gravity, but the gravitational force still affects the body from front to back, back to front, or side to side. Thus, in the end, there is no equal for actual weightless conditions to explore how the every- day effects of gravity affect the human body. Thanks to a portable system worn by 12 as- tronauts, researchers were able to measure blood pressure for 24 hours during which the astronauts carried out their normal activities. Twenty-four-hour blood pressure measure- ments are used regularly in clinical work to es- tablish whether an individual exhibits high blood pressure because blood pressure readings taken during daily activities are a more reliable predictor for development of cardiovascular disease than those taken during a few visits to a doctor's surgery. As a control, 24-hour measurements were re- corded both before and after the fl ight while the astronauts were on the ground. Experimental measurements were taken under weightless con- ditions during missions that varied from ve to 10 days. One set of measurements was per- formed on the rst or second day of fl ight and another during the last. The investigators observed a reduction in daytime heart rate as well as the diastolic pres- sure, the lower value in a blood pressure read- ing that indicates the pressure between heart beats when the heart is lling with blood. The decrease in diastolic pressure was small but in-dicated that some degree of dilation of the small arterial vessels had occurred, and led the au- thors to conclude that spacefl ight decreases the stress on the human cardiovascular system. Cardiac Output While the 24-hour monitor allowed investiga- tors to record what happened, it does not explain how. To nd out whether a change in blood pressure is induced by a change in the out- put of blood by the heart or by dilation of the peripheral arteries, one needs to measure cardi- ac output. Cardiac output can be measured using a closed breathing system, whereby the subject in- hales and exhales a gas mixture to and from a rubber bag ( see Figure 4 ). This gas mixture con- tains a tracer that is taken up by the blood fl ow- ing through the lungs. The amount of tracer re- maining in the exhaled air is monitored. The rate of uptake is proportional to the amount of blood fl owing through the lungs, which is the same as cardiac output. When this method was rst used in space, the rate of tracer uptake increased by some 18% during the initial days compared with the up- right standing position on the ground, indicat- ing a corresponding increase in cardiac output. This initial increase subsided a bit during the following days; however, blood pressure was not measured during this rst investigation. On the ISS, Dutch cosmonaut An- dr\u00e9 Kuipers is delivering blood samples before being tted with the Portapres 24-hour blood pres-sure monitoring device. www.spacefl ight.esa.int 21 SPACE CHANNEL / PHIL SAUNDERS (Figure 4); DATA SOURCE :AUTHORS (Figure 5)FIGURES 4 - 5. Measuring Cardiac OutputBecause cardiac output increased in weight- less conditions and blood pressure was un- changed or slightly reduced, the small arterial resistance vessels must have been dilated, be- cause otherwise, blood pressure would have in- creased. We estimated a 14% decrease in resis- tance of the arterial vessels during a week of spacefl ight as calculated by mean blood pres- sure divided by cardiac output, where the in- crease in cardiac output was 22% and the mean blood pressure remained unchanged ( see Figure 5). The values in space were compared with val- ues obtained on Earth while the subjects were sitting upright. Relatively speaking, a week in space is relaxing to the cardiovascular system. Confounding Kidneys When studying the reaction of an interconnect- ed system such as circulation to an extreme change in environment such as weightlessness, however, the answer is never as simple as the adjustment of a single variable. The explanation for the body's reaction is a complicated one, and in some respects appears contradictory. Obser- vations made approximately 15 years ago indi- cated that the sympathetic nervous system is stimulated during space travel. As discussed previously, the sympathetic nerves are the \"accelerators,\" and their activity would be inconsistent with the relaxed cardiac state indi- cated by dilated blood vessels and decreased blood pressure. This discrepancy becomes apparent when we examine the kidney and hormonal respons- es. During a Spacelab mission in 1993, four of the astronauts performed the rst and, until to- day, only intravenous saline infusion during a spacefl ight. The intention was to investigate how the renal output of salt and fl uid would be affected by a week in space. Surprisingly, the rate of salt and urine excretion in space was sig- ni cantly less than when laying prone on Earth and was at the same level as when sitting up- right. In addition, levels of noradrenaline, a hormone transmitter of the sympathetic ner- vous system, not only increase in space, at times they are even higher than when a person is seat- ed upright on the ground. Increased blood lev-els of noradrenaline were also observed later by other investigators during the Neurolab Mis- sion that fl ew in 1998. What makes these ndings surprising is that usually, in a resting person, reduced excretion of salt and fl uid and an increased noradrenaline concentration in the blood go hand in hand with MEAN CARDIAC OUTPUT OVER 4 HOURSL/min 4 2086 1 G O G (Earth's gravity, seated) (Weightless, spaceflight)MEAN PERIPHERAL VASCULAR RESISTANCE OVER 4 HOURSmm Hg * min/L 4 208 6 1 G O G (Earth's gravity, seated) (Weightless, spaceflight)12 1016 1418FIGURE 5.

Results shown are after one week of space-fl ight compared with the upright seat- ed position on the ground before fl ight. Cardiac output was elevated by 1 L/min or by about 20%. Simultane-ously, mean peripheral vascular resis-tance is decreased by about 14%, indi-cating less constriction of the smaller blood vessels.FIGURE 4. Cardiac output can be measured non-invasively using a rebreathing technique, whereby a tracer gas (N 2O) is taken up by the blood fl owing through the lungs and the reduction of the gas detected by an infrared photo acoustic system. The reduction rate of the gas is proportional to the amount of blood fl owing through the lungs, which is equal to cardiac output.Lungs HeartRebreathing bag ArteriesN2O O2 Veins OrgansRebreathingvalve22 LOOKING UP: in Microgravity Research an increased peripheral vascular resistance\u2014 rather than the decreased resistance seen in space conditions. Conversely, an increase in car- diac output during resting, non-exercising con- ditions would be accompanied by less sympa- thetic nervous activity, meaning increased excre-tion of salt and fl uids and decreased release of noradrenaline into the bloodstream. Lung-Heart Interaction One explanation for the above discrepancy could reside in the unique lung-heart interac- tion seen in weightless conditions, which is impossible to replicate on the ground. Without the pull of gravity, the thoracic cage expands, pulling the lungs and structures surrounding the heart open like an accordion, thereby fur-ther expanding the central vessels and the heart itself. This mechanical expansion of the thorac-ic cage is maintained throughout spacefl ight, irrespective of its duration, and thus contributes to the increase in blood fl ow to the heart. This reaction occurs during all weightless or near-weightless conditions\u2014including parabol- ic, free-fall trajectory aircraft flights where weightlessness can be created for only 20-25 sec- onds. In these fl ights, the aircraft follows the same path as an object in free-fall, such as a can- nonball red into the air. During this brief time, we have shown that cardiac output increases by as much as 29%, and the arterial resistance ves- sels dilate, which leads to a decrease in blood pressure. One hypothesis could be that thorax expan- sion stimulates the blood pressure responses in an unusual way so that sympathetic nervous ac- tivity is gradually stimulated instead of being suppressed. The continuous stretch of the ves-sels could cause a decrease in sensitivity of the chest cavity pressure sensors. Alternatively, the decreased extracellular fl uid volume in the legs might also trigger sympathetic activity. For now, however, these explanations re- main speculative. We cannot explain the mech- anisms for the body to be, physiologically speaking, both relaxed and agitated at the same time, but nding such an explanation is a high priority. We are currently monitoring blood pressure and cardiac output over 24 hours in as- tronauts during missions on the ISS of at least Lessons from the Animal Kingdom In sh, blood pressure must remain low because their one- chamber heart pumps blood through the gills before it can fl ow to the organs. Any substantial increase in blood pres-sure and they would bleed to death through the delicate structures of the gills. The arteries supplying the gills must therefore respond strongly and quickly to high blood pres-sure by slowing the heart beat. Humans too have delicate structures, such as our lungs and brain, that cannot tolerate too high a pressure. In fact, the blood pressure in human lungs is about the same as that in a sh. The arteries that in sh supply the gills with blood have developed through evolution into similar sites in mam-mals (and thus humans), where systemic and pulmonary blood pressure is sensed. Giraffes too can teach us something about pressure\u2014 and gravity. When compared with humans, giraffes exhibit much higher blood pressures at heart level, but exhibit simi-lar blood pressures in the arteries just below the brain. This discrepancy indicates that the heart compensates for the varying distance between the head and the heart. Does that mean tall people are at risk for higher blood pressures than shorter individuals? That has not been determined, but there are indications that this is the case. SPACE CHANNEL / PHIL SAUNDERSABOUT THE AUTHORS Peter Norsk is a professor in grav- itational and space physiology at the department of Biomedical Sci- ences at the University of Copen- hagen, Denmark. The purpose of his research is to understand how gravity affects blood pressure and volume regulation in humans, and whether it is a factor in the devel- opment of hypertension. For this purpose, chronic long-term weightlessness in space is a unique experimental model. Understand- ing how blood pressure is regulat- ed is important for treatment of hypertension, which is the leading cause of death among the world's population. John M. Karemaker is an associ- a te professor of Physiology at the Academic Medical Centre of the University of Amsterdam in The Netherlands. His interest in space research is directly related to his research in blood pressure control. Astronauts are the most healthy and most often medically tested subjects that one can imagine. Still, when returning from space they very often experience spells of diz- ziness or outright fainting. This condition is an important subject of research in the AMC, since \"nor- mal people\" may also be plagued by this condition, which is very dif- cult to treat. It is his hope that the combination of both areas of research, space and terrestrial, may bene t both astronauts and patients alike. www.spacefl ight.esa.int 23 three months. Simultaneously, we are collecting blood to measure the noradrenaline concentra- tion in platelets as a refl ection of the long-term effects of weightless conditions on sympathetic nervous activity. Perspectives Hypertension. On the ground, people normally spend most of their time upright, and, as we have discussed, gravity takes its toll on a body continually in this position. When upright, blood pressure is higher in the lower portions of the body, which can induce constriction and structural thickening of the vessel walls of the dependent arteries and thus might contribute to hypertension and cardiovascular disease. The extent of gravity's role in disease development and the potential rami cations of its removal are not clear. Current data indicate that spacefl ight may have positive effects on the circulation because the small arteries are continuously dilated, and the uneven pressure levels between the upper and lower body are abolished. However, inves- tigations of the heart muscle in space have pro- duced confl icting results. One report showed that the ability of the heart to contract was com- promised immediately after 129-144 days of spacefl ight. In contrast, Russian scientists used ultrasound to perform cardiac scans of 15 cos- monauts following a few months of spacefl ight and concluded that the pumping of blood from the left heart chamber was improved. Clearly the health of the astronauts demands that we nd a de nitive answer for these con- fl icting results. We are currently exploring the effects on the cardiovascular system of extend-ed missions of six months on the ISS. Prelimi-n ary results indicate that the increase in cardiac output and dilation of peripheral arterial vessels continues during these missions of several months. If con rmed, these results could mean that spacefl ight and weightlessness over long pe- riods of time are healthy for the cardiovascular system. Heart failure. Data from space and simula- tion studies also have implications for under- standing how gravity stresses patients with heart failure. In heart failure, the pumping ca- pacity of the heart is reduced and thus is more sensitive to the pull of gravity. The insuf cient pumping of the blood through the kidneys acti- vates the hormone system that helps regulate long-term blood pressure, leading to constric- tion of the blood vessels and fl uid accumulation in the body. To alleviate the stress of gravity in heart fail- ure, we have immersed patients in thermo-neu- tral water of 34.5\u00baC. Here, the outside water pressure compensates for the gravity-induced pressure gradients in circulation, which leaves the cardiovascular system virtually weightless. When we compared study parameters in these patients with control patients sitting upright, water immersion improved the circulatory con- dition in the heart failure patients, who had been stabilized with standard medical drug treatment prior to the intervention. Because the results seen during spacefl ight validate those seen during water immersion, it is fair to conclude that gravity is a constant burden for heart failure patients, which aggra- vates the condition. Further development and study of situations that alleviate the stress of gravity may lead to future therapies for these patients.

Blood analyses have shown that both the innate and adaptive arms of the immune system are negatively affected by microgravity, and con ne-ment studies have shown inhibition in response to stress. Current study is focused on using small monitoring devices to watch for how and when immune chang- es become a health risk to better target prevention and therapy. \u2014The EditorsWhen thinking big, we must also remember to think small, especially when we need to fend off illness in space. As Victor Hugo once said, \"Where the telescope ends, the microscope begins; and who can say which has the wider vision?\" By Alexander Chouk\u00e8r, Boris Morukov and Clarence SamsClinical Immunology in New Frontiers Before 1961, when Soviet cosmonaut Yuri Gagarin became the rst human in space, many considered our very sur- vival in such circumstances to be impossible. Debates erupted about whether there would be fatal incidents of heart failure. No one knew what would happen to the body in the absence of gravity. At no stage had the evolutionary process pre- pared human beings to live without it, in isolation and darkness and in an overall hostile environment. Since that historic voyage, people have continued to push the boundaries of space exploration and have survived the experi- ence in increasing numbers. With the ensuing progress of tech- nology for international spacefl ight, two or more cosmonauts/ astronauts were routinely sent to space during the Soviet Salyut and Mir missions and the US Gemini/Apollo and Space Shuttle missions. While the concerns of fatal heart failure proved, thank- fully, to be unnecessary, physiological changes as a result of space travel did occur in other areas. Blood analysed from astronauts after the 1973 NASA Skylab Mission showed that immune function was altered. More than 50% of the Apollo astronauts had experienced either bacterial or viral infection during spacefl ight and then later upon return to Earth. Although most prominent research of human life sciences in space is usually focused in areas such as bone and muscle loss, these results inspired more profound investigations in the eld of fundamental immunology. Maintaining good health under the unique stresses of space travel requires intense study of the im- mune system. After all, the nearest hospital is hundreds of miles SPACE CHANNEL / PHIL SAUNDERS26 LOOKING UP: Europe's Quiet Revolution in Microgravity Research DATA SOURCE: ALEXANDER CHOUK\u00c8Raway. Research into the body's reaction to mi- crogravity and cosmic radiation, as well as the psychological stress of living in a hostile envi- ronment, is crucial before attempting longer missions to Mars and beyond. Lines of Defence In broad terms, the immune system consists of layered mechanisms that protect the body from disease. Containing a wide variety of cell types, if you were to add up its more than four trillion cells, the human immune system weighs more than the liver and brain put together. The rst lines of defence are those surface barriers between the host and its environment, including physical barriers such as skin and mucus as well as chemical barriers such as stomach acid and enzymes in saliva or tears. Invading microbes that penetrate the surface and enter the host body meet the second line of defence\u2014the so-called \"innate\" immune sys- tem\u2014that includes phagocytes, white that engulf and destroy pathogenic (dis-ease-causing) bacteria, virus-infected cells and other foreign substances. This second line of de- fence is located in tissues such as the lung or in- testine, which can be vulnerable entry points for germs. When under attack, the innate system triggers a generalized infl ammatory response, which causes redness and swelling as well as the fever and body aches associated with the fl u. When this system overreacts, the aberrant in- fl ammation can damage cells and tissues, caus- ing signi cant clinical problems. This infl ammatory response can be initiated by a vast re-circulating pool of innate immune cells in the blood or tissues that act through im- portant and evolutionarily preserved receptors on cell surfaces, the toll-like receptor family. These receptors control the production of sig- nalling proteins called cytokines that induce in- fl ammation and activate immune cells in re- sponse to invading microbes. These immune cells are located in more than 500 lymph nodes throughout the human body, waiting inside like military troops on active reserve. Lymph nodes FIGURE 1. INNATE IMMUNE CHANGES IN SPACEFLIGHT In the course of ghting bacteria, killer white blood cells called phagocytes (which in Greek means \"cell-eater\") produce hydrogen per-oxide (H 2O2). In this study, blood was taken from astronauts and an immune reaction in-duced using either an ion-carrier with anti-biotic properties (A23187) or an organic com-pound used in research because it promotes tumor growth (PMA). Blood was tested be-fore spacefl ight and then again one and se- ven days after return from a six-month mis-sion.

The troops are released and when they recognize a pathogen, they trigger the cytokines that unleash both the general in- fl ammation described above and a more specif- ic, or adaptive, response described below. This generalized innate immunity is an an- cient defense system found in orders of life from fungi to plants to star sh. Only higher verte- brates like humans developed a third line of de- fence that reacts speci cally to the germ itself. After the rst exposure to a microorganism, \"killer\" B- and T-lymphocytes are able to recog- nize that microorganism so that on the second encounter, the response is targeted to that spe- ci c germ, allowing more rapid and more ef - cient action and elimination. In their lifetime, lymphocytes may or may not encounter the target they are capable of rec- ognizing, but if they do they can be activated to multiply into a large number of identical cells. T-cells recognize the invaders by their speci c proteins or antigens and can either directly at- tack the invaders or activate fellow T- or B-cells. The B-cells produce antibodies that either help destroy the microorganisms or mark them for attack. Adaptive immunity is the principle be-hind the efficacy of vaccination and the ac- quired immunity from diseases such as chicken pox that occur once, most often in childhood. Immunity Altered by Stress Germs and microorganisms are not the only threats that provoke the immune system to leap into action. Environmental or situational change can tax the body in other ways, creat- ing a physical response. Although the de ni- tion of \"stress\" is still a matter of debate in this context, stress research pioneer, endocrinolo- gist Hans Selye, succinctly de ned the adapta- tion of any system to envi- ronmental changes: \"Stress is a non-specific response of the body to any demand placed upon it ... [it] results whenever we are faced with exter- nal changes or demands and such demands include any variations in the individuals' environment.\" In general terms, stress is a challenge: can we adapt to a new condition, regardless of what it may be, as quickly and with the least damage to ourselves as possible? Sweating is a simple exam- ple: faced with a rise in temperature, we sweat to cool off and maintain a constant temperature.

ADAPTIVE IMMUNE CHANGES IN SPACEFLIGHT T-lymphocytes can remember a microbe after the rst exposure, a property called adaptive immunity. As part of this function, T-lymphocytes produce chemicals called cytokines that aid in the immune response. Two cy- tokines were measured in this study: interleukin 2, which stimulates growth and differentiation of T-cells, and interferon-y, which inhibits viral replication among other functions. Human T-cells were separated and grown in culture medium that induces cell reproduction. Prefl ight results showed normal production of interferon-y (green circle) and interleukin-2 (orange circle). After a long mis- sion on the ISS, T-cells were almost completely unable to generate both cytokine messengers. 28 LOOKING UP: Europe's Quiet Revolution in Microgravity ResearchThe immune response is obviously much more complicated. This system is not autono- mous and several co-factors affect responses when adapting to a stressful, new environment. Space missions demand that humans cope with living conditions never experienced before: pri- marily the absence of gravity plus varying de- grees of cosmic radiation. In addition, astro- nauts face mental stress that results from con- finement and uncomfortable and unnatural living and working conditions including the lack of privacy, a heavy workload and an abnor- mal day-night cycle. In addition, the microbio- logical environment on the space station chang- es over time and germs may evolve in response. Effects of Microgravity Depression of T-cell lymphocyte activation due to near-zero gravity was rst observed in an experiment conducted during the Spacelab 1 Mission in 1983. The data triggered several oth- er investigations that attempted to map the com- plex mechanisms of T-cell activation and sup-pression both in space under true microgravity and on the ground in the clinostat machine, which is used to approximate microgravity. Results showed that these effects and the po- tential consequences to our ability to ght off germs were indeed debilitating. The lympho- cytes exposed to microgravity almost complete- ly lost their capability to react in their normal defensive role. Studies of animals conducted in space also indicated reduced killer cell activities and a higher susceptibility to viral infections. This suppression is thought to happen be- cause the organization of the cells is geared to gravity; without it, the cells become disoriented and fail to function normally. Cell architecture consists of a cytoskeleton, which functions like scaffolding. It maintains cell shape as well as plays an important role in intracellular trans-port and communication. Recently it has been shown that microgravity alters certain internal signalling pathways of immune cells, thus caus- ing those cells to function improperly. Cosmic Radiation Cosmic radiation is everywhere in space. When combined with other stress factors such as micro- gravity, it is highly likely that radiation can have an aggravated effect on the immune system. When on extended missions, astronauts will be exposed to stronger and more varied types of radiation than that experienced normally. These radiation types consist primarily of solar ener- getic particles, protons and highly charged en- ergetic particles of galactic cosmic rays. The de- gree of exposure to solar energetic particles will increase during interplanetary missions as the partial \"shielding\" that results from the Earth's magnetic field is left behind when leaving Earth's orbit. Although little is known about the conse- quences of cosmic radiation on immune cells, many publications con rm the impact of other forms of radiation on immune cells. Such radia- tion can kill cells, cause mutations, cause infl am- mation and malignancies and otherwise weaken the immune system and induce immune system disorders and cancer. This damage, however, can take years to become apparent. So while an as-tronaut returning home from a long mission may appear to be healthy, is there a time bomb tick- ing away somewhere within the body? Mission-Associated Stress Like that of cosmic radiation, the consequences of mission-associated or mental stress are insidi-ous and may not be immediately apparent. In addition, we may not immediately associate stress with an immune system response. Condi- tions such as post-traumatic stress disorder are often associated more concretely with psycholog- ical trauma than with long-term physical prob- lems, as there is little conclusive research in that area. To understand the relationship between the mind and the immune system, we must rst con- sider the human body as a whole, with complex, interrelated systems. Immune system function depends on the informational signalling of both the endocrine and nervous systems. The endocrine system is composed of small organs that produce hormones, chemicals that act as messengers to regulate not only immuni- ty but metabolism, growth, puberty and other \"holistic\" or whole-body functions. These hor-FIGURE 3. INNATE AND ADAPTIVE IMMUNE CHANGES Changes in immune cell activity of both the innate (natural killer cells) and the adaptive (T-lympho-cytes) arms were measured within one week of returing from space missions of 137-437 days. In both cell types, decreased function was found in more than 40% of the cosmonauts, indicating suppres-sion across both innate and ac-quired immunity.

These hormones can be produced and act local- ly or be produced by a distinct gland such as the pituitary, thyroid or adrenal gland and trans- ported through the blood to the active defence cells. Once there, the hormones will stimulate, inhibit or maintain cell function depending on the messages sent. During extended periods of stress, our de- fences are kept on alert. Cortisol, a glucocorti- coid that is often referred to as the \"stress hor- mone,\" circulates at higher levels in response to stress and other potential dangers. It increases blood pressure, blood sugar levels and suppress- es the immune response. Cortisol and other hor- mones are released into the blood in response to neural stimulus and their levels are controlled by brain activity. Investigating Stress While the physical processes behind the effects of stress on the body are complex, the real-life translation can be unfortunately simple. When under strain, we are more likely to get sick. In studies of medical students during the highly stressful time of exams, tests showed increased stress hormones and suppressed immune cell activities, which resulted in the reactivation of dormant herpes simplex virus type 1 (cold sores) as well as the Epstein-Barr virus. Other investi- gations showed that psychological stress can affect wound healing and responses to vaccina- tion, supporting the hypothesis that stress does negatively affect immune responses with poten- tial clinical consequences. Clinical investiga-tions have shown that patients under psycholog- ical or mental stress also exhibit signs of impaired and altered immunity. Other investigations have been conducted of stressful living conditions, an important concern for astronauts. Earth-bound con nement stud- ies have illustrated the effects of this type of stress on regulation of the immune system. The ex- treme living conditions studied were similar to those experienced during spacefl ight. In different studies, subjects either were con ned for 10 to 240 days in modular chambers that mimicked the living quarters in space or were con ned in isolation for months in the Canadian Arctic. The stress responses and speci c immune changes seen in these studies were quite similar to those observed in astronauts after spacefl ight. As with the medical students, con ned sub- Tracing Immunology Clinical immunology is the study of diseases caused by disorders of the immune system (failure, aberrant action and malignant growth of the cellular elements of the system) as well as dis- eases of other systems where immune reactions play a part in the pathology and clinical features. The results of blood tests from the 1973 NASA Skylab mission were a wake-up call for the eld. The astronauts' immune functions were clearly altered following spacefl ight. Afterward, the re-sulting investigations rst used in vitro cell suspensions containing lymphocytes, a type of white blood cell, to estimate the effects of gravitational changes on speci c immune cell responses. Emerging methodology in biomedicine has allowed immunologists to further study relationships between the organ systems and the immune responses. In addition to controlling infections and eliminating germs, immunologic responses are also responsible for eliminating non-functional or dysfunctional tissue-cells (e.g., tumor cells). Failure to maintain adequate immunity may result in autoimmune diseases (e.g., rheumatoid arthritis), acute and life threatening infections, over-whelming systemic immune responses (e.g., septicemia) or the development of cancer. Psychoneuroimmunology (PNI) is the eld of human physiology research dealing with the complex interactions between the central nervous system, endocrine and immune systems under conditions of stress. PNI researcher Kevin Tracey from the Feinstein Institute for Medical Research in Manhasset, New York, and Ronald Glaser from The Ohio State University Mind/Body Center in Columubus, Ohio, have shown that brain activity and the nervous system control infl ammation in a feedback manner where hormones are released into the blood in response to a neural stimulus, altogether affecting immune and health status. During extended periods of stress, our defences are kept on alert. Cortisol, often referred to as the \"stress hormone,\" circulates at higher levels in response to stress and other potential dangers. 30 LOOKING UP: Europe's Quiet Revolution in Microgravity Research NASA / JPL / MALIN SPACE SCIENCE SYSTEMS jects showed a reactivation of the herpes virus, which is usually dormant in healthy adults. This virus also became active during spacefl ight. Un- der these conditions, the body's ability to re- spond to a threat such as the herpes virus de- creases. Stress causes cortisol to be released and suppress immune functions of both the innate and adaptive systems by inhibiting cytokines and T-cell production. After missions of several months, samples of the astronauts' blood illus- trated that the immune cell functions of both the innate and adaptive immunity were indeed sup- pressed in the rst days after return to Earth ( see Figures 1-3 ). These tests and subsequent experiments also revealed higher levels of catecholamines circu- lating in the astronauts' blood than in non- stressed subjects. Like glucocorticoids, cate- cholamines are chemicals released by the adre- nal glands. Although the glucocorticoid stress response is more well known, catecholamines suppress the cell activation pattern of white b l o o d c e l l s . T h e m o s t r e c o g n i z a b l e c a t e - cholamine is epinephrine, commonly known as adrenaline. Along with norepinephrine, these \" ght-or-fl ight\" hormones not only increase heart rate and blood pressure but also inhibit immune cells' capability to ingest microbes. Hidden Threats How will an already suppressed immune system cope with challenges from the microbiological environment in a closed space station or a remote habitat? Although no unusual microbial hazards have been indenti ed to date, the Inter- national Space Station will inevitably house an unknown number of microorganisms that will i ncrease with the duration of operation. Recent surveys have identi ed some potentially oppor- tunistic pathogens, and the number and types of microorganisms may further increase with the length and number of missions and the number of visitors to the ISS. Not only is the microbiological load itself sub- ject to changes, but the bugs' ability to cause dis- ease are also subject to change during spacefl ight. In fact, the virulence of speci c bacteria has been shown to intensify. Researchers tested this by growing the bacteria Salmonella typhimurium on board the space shuttle and comparing this growth with ground control cultures. Complex proteomic and genetic analyses revealed that changes in gene transcription and protein syn- thesis resulted from spacefl ight. These changes were not only of interest for \"academic\" reasons but also because these bacteria increased infec- tion in a mouse model. In summary, the variable microbiological environment together with the greater disease-causing ability of bacteria may increase health risks to the astronauts when the suppressed immune system is confronted with microbiological contamination. An Ounce of Prevention Systematic investigation of the human immune system's adaptation in space has recently begun on the ISS. Current scienti c projects include Immuno and Integrated Immune . The upgrad- ed research opportunities available on the ISS Columbus module will enable more intense investigations into the interaction of the human immune system with the speci c microbiologi- cal environment on the ISS. In addition, Earth-bound studies of control- led bedrest, con nement in the Arctic or Ant-Mars500 The State Scienti c Centre of the Russian Federation-Institute of Biomedical Prob- lems of the Russian Academy of Sciences and the European Space Agency have scheduled a program in 2008-2010 designed to simulate travel to Mars and back (each leg is 250 days), including a 3-week \"landing\" on Mars. Six subjects will live and work in a newly built facility including living quarters, a medical module, a storage container, a simulator of the Martian surfac e and a simulator of the Mars landing mod- ule. The last will house three of the six participants during the three-week landing phase. The living conditions, as well as most of the mission-associated stressors, will be comparable to those currently experienced on the ISS \u2014including the communica- tion delay. Normally, the delay in the communication with the control centre can be up to 20 minutes. Thus, the MARS500 crew will have to make independent decisions on problems that arise. In the future, it is possible that the mission's duration could be ex-tended to 700 days to simulate a manned fl ight to Mars. www.spacefl ight.esa.int 31ACKNOWLEDGMENTS The authors are grateful to the following agencies for the support of this research: Roscomos, NASA, and ESA as well as the German National Space Program supported by the German Space Agency (DLR) and the Federal Ministry of Economics and Technology (BMWi) for providing all the logistic and nancial support.

Innovative and user friendly monitoring devices that use, for example, miniscule amounts of blood or exhaled air will enable repeated assess- ments, which would be used to decide the type of intervention necessary as well as when it should be administered. Interventions could in- clude vaccination or drug treatment. More so- phisticated preventive methods lie in the remote future, such as the manipulation of gene se- quences that trigger gravity-dependent immune cell dysfunction as well as those that protect from radiation. Currently, options to protect the crew of long- term missions in space are threefold: pharma- ceutical treatment, environmental manipulation (such as the use of arti cial gravity) and protec- tion from cosmic radiation by using shields or by avoiding major solar events. Those space trav- elers who are highly susceptible to immune or stress-related health problems are most likely to bene t from such protection. Beyond the ISS A journey to Mars and back was once thought to be the realm of science ction, but explora- tions of this kind are being actively discussed by scientists and engineers today (see \"Mars500,\" opposite page). These plans could become real- ity in our children's lifetime, and one of the most crucial requirements will be adequate life support systems and living conditions. Even with that issue addressed, however, the conditions on lunar or Martian surfaces and their consequences on human immunology are poorly investigated so far. In addition, the loss of visual contact with Earth or \"Earth out of sight syndrome,\" during such a long mission and the communication delay that will surely occur will add new mission-associated stress. Any exploration of Mars and, looking even further into the future, lunar or Martian colo- nisation program means facing technical chal- lenges to de ne and develop suitable living con- ditions. Creating a robust habitat with the at- mospheric pressure that the human body is accustomed to on Earth requires an enormous amount of energy. Finding the lowest accepta- ble value of continuous atmospheric pressure that the body can tolerate will be critical to the ef cient running of a life support system. If the atmospheric pressure and oxygen levels are too low, the oxygen deprivation would result in a condition called hypoxia similar to that seen in climbers with altitude sickness. A subnormal oxygen level in tissues leads to symptoms that include headaches, shortness of breath and nau- sea. The effects of prolonged hypoxia on im- mune cells could result in immune suppression as well as other challenges to the system. Summary In recent years the scienti c community became aware that the combination of multiple sources of both physical and mental stress that occur during spacefl ight can have detrimental effects on the immune system. Understanding how this system will cope with the even greater stress of extended duration missions such as interplanetary spacefl ight is absolutely essen- tial to reduce the risk to those brave enough to crew such a mission. An international research approach will open new insight into the regulation of immune re- sponses and will address health concerns that may occur during these missions. In the newly installed Columbus research laboratory and other modules of the ISS, researchers will use a multidisciplinary approach to understand bet- ter how microgravity, cosmic radiation and mis- sion associated stress can infl uence immune function. In addition to the crucial task of main- taining the astronaut's health, this research will also bene t patients here on Earth with the po- tential for targeted drug treatment, vaccina-tions and other therapies. These achievements could be implemented into the treatment of any patient, of any age, at any location, from the lo- cal clinic to the ISS. A journey to Mars and back could become reality in our children's lifetime, and one of the most crucial requirements will be adequate life support systems and living conditions.CREDIT 32 LOOKING UP: Europe's Quiet Revolution in Microgravity Research Bone Loss SPECIAL REPORT: www.spacefl ight.esa.int 33During the many millions of years in which vertebrate ani- mals evolved, the human skeleton gradually stood erect, against the Earth's gravity. As part and parcel of this feat, the skeletal system also evolved to function within its bound-aries\u2014to withstand its force and the impacts caused by simple movements like walking. The skeleton's primary role is locomo-tion: it allows the body's muscles to move the limbs. Secondary roles such as maintaining balance and supporting the body's shape are infl uenced by the demands of movement. Bone cells adapt to these variables\u2014the total mechanical load or stress placed on them\u2014for more ef cient performance. Despite its infl exible appearance, bone is a living tissue, and it must continually destroy and rebuild itself throughout a life-time of use. This process, called remodelling or turnover, occurs in two phases. The rapid resorption phase takes two to three weeks and then the slower formation phase lasts two to three months. Different types of bone cells carry out these phases. Os-teoclasts degrade the bone surface and release calcium to be re-absorbed. Osteoblasts then ll in the pit with new bone. Bone tissue works to increase or decrease skeletal mass based on its use. This means that during times of increased exercise, for example, skeletal mass is preserved or increased. Conversely, it decreases with reduced exercise or movement, which is what hap-pens to astronauts during spacefl ight. Simply put, the skeleton doesn't have to work as hard without the pressure of gravity. In near-weightlessness, not only is less movement required and fewer impacts felt but less strength and power is required to execute the motion. The detrimental effects of this extreme \"unloading\" on astronauts have been seen since the earliest spacefl ights. Experiments have carefully documented bone loss in various parts of the body and in different types of bone tissue, but research continues into exactly how and why these loss-es occur. Part of this research is focused on the bone cells them-selves and their ability to \"sense\" the mechanical load placed on them in order to adapt to it. How gravity and other loading factors are detected and then translated into a response is yet unknown. Because of this long history of intense research, two articles are presented here that examine the effects of microgravity from very different angles. The rst article, \"Zero Gravity: Bad to the Bones,\" by Laurence Vico and Christian Alexandre, reviews ev-idence of bone loss during missions from the 1960s to today. Re-sults from these studies show markers of increased resorption, overall calcium losses, and a gradient of loss that increases be-ginning at the spine through the lower body. The authors also analyse data on whether losses occurred in the hard outer layer of bone or the more porous bone interior. The second article, \"Our Sensitive Skeleton,\" by Rommel Ba- cabac, Jack van Loon and Jenneke Klein-Nulend, looks at bone adaptation on the cellular level. The authors discuss what is known and unknown about how bone cells called osteocytes sense grav-ity and mechanical stress. They also analyse the high level of sen-sitivity of bone cells to minute amounts of strain as well as the ef-fects of different types of strain or stress on bone formation. How this knowledge translates into prevention and recovery is the ultimate goal. Current strategies to counteract micrograv-ity's effects consist mainly of exercise, but it has not been enough. HUMAN HEALTH As we exlore further out into space, astronauts will have to spend more time in microgravity and risk increasing losses in bone den-sity. Some research indicates that the rate of recovery for missions of several months can exceed twice the time spent in space, but no one knows how or if the body would recover after spending years there. Research into the dynamics of skeletal changes, cel-lular communication and how to effectively increase the mechan-ical load on bones is necessary not only to protect the health of the astronauts but also to combat osteoporosis here on Earth.Sticks and stones may break your bones, but underuse will make them brittle. Like extended bedrest, an envi-ronment without gravity reduces the workload on bones and makes them weaker. Because research in this area is extensive, two articles are presented here to illustrate different approaches being taken to understand\u2014and combat\u2014these effects. uring the man y millions of years in which vertebrate ani - mals evolved, the human skeleton graduall y stood erect, against t he Eart h's gravity.

The authors also analyse data on w hether losses occurre d in the hard outer layer in Space SPACE CHANNEL / PHIL SAUNDERSAT A GLANCE Bone loss in space seems to occur in a gradient that be-gins at the spine and be-comes greater in the lower limbs. The rate of recovery after long missions can exceed twice the time spent in mi-crogravity conditions. Future study should focus on the dynamics of bone loss, its relationship to oth-er body systems and more effective exercise and/or prevention strategies. \u2014The EditorsAfter early explorations into space when doctors announced that the astronauts had suffered bone loss, people all over the world took notice. For many, \"bone loss\" spelled \"osteoporosis,\" a disease associated with aging; not with the strong, robust young men who were sent into space. Literally trans- lated to mean \"porous bones,\" osteoporosis is a common aging disorder that affl icts a large portion of older people. The World Health Organization estimates that the condition is responsible for approximately 650,000 frac- tures a year in the European Union alone. In fact, one WHO report states, \"Osteoporosis- induced fractures cause a great burden to soci- ety,\" and adds that such hip fractures can affect 40% of women over 50 years old. While hormonal and other changes associat- ed with aging are the main considerations for os- teoporosis on Earth, in space, lack of gravity re- sults in reduced mechanical use of bones. Both the decrease in strength or power necessary to create movement and the decrease in the amount of movement overall are thought to be the main factors leading to bone loss in astronauts. Stud- ies have shown that the number and the ampli- tude of various demands on the skeleton while in orbit are extremely low compared to the nu- merous impacts during daily life on Earth. In fact, near weightlessness reduces the stimuli on bone by approximately half of that experienced during a typical work day on Earth. Little wonder then that doctors and scientists saw a two-pronged reason for delving further into the cause and effect of bone loss in space. The rst was to prevent the foreseen danger to astronauts' health during long, interplanetary missions, and the second was to nd new ways 34 LOOKING UP: Europe's Quiet Revolution in Microgravity Research fter earl y explorations into s pace when doctors announced that the astronautsZero Gravity: Bad to the Bones to combat such a widely experienced condition on Earth. In addition, the microgravity environ- ment also offers the means to study other factors that are either dif cult to observe and measure on Earth or have not yet been investigated. Early Indications Two important parameters have marked the increasing level and speed of research. First, as the length of missions increased, researchers were able to gather more useful data. Second, the means to gather data improved with the advent of more precise instruments. After most of the early Gemini and Apollo missions in the 1960s, astronauts showed both increased urinary calcium levels and decreased bone mineral density (BMD) as measured by ra- diodensitometry. Urinary calcium is an indica- tor of bone remodelling, or turnover. As bone tissue rebuilds itself, it rst destroys old bone and then replaces those cells with new bone. Cells called osteoclasts degrade bone tissue by secreting substances that dissolve calcium and other minerals that make up its structure, a pro- cess called resorption. An increase in urinary calcium can indicate a corresponding increase in bone resorption and release of calcium from bone into the bloodstream\u2014in the absence of other factors such as increased calcium intake. The Beginning of Long Flights Beginning with the studies conducted during the three Skylab missions in the 1970s: Skylab 2 (29) days, Skylab 3 (59 days), and Skylab 4 (84 days), we could see greater bone loss in the heel com- pared with the upper limbs as a function of the time spent in microgravity. The astronauts' uri- nary calcium output progressively increased to HUMAN HEALTH www.spacefl ight.esa.int 35Bone loss in astronauts was rst documented in the early fl ights of the 1960s. Since then, longer missions and better equipment have enabled more detailed research and a wealth of data. By Laurence Vico and Christian Alexandre 80-100% above normal, where the levels even- tually plateaued. In addition to calcium, other urinary markers of bone degradation increased: the amino acid hydroxyproline increased up to 33% and urinary phosphorus also increased. After the Skylab 3 and 4 missions, bone loss was found in the heel while no changes were observed in the two forearm bones. Three months after the 84-day Skylab 4 fl ight, heel bone density was still signi cantly lower than normal. Frozen urinary samples recently analysed with speci c blood tests developed to measure biochemical markers of bone remodel- ling con rmed the increased resorption. Peace in Space In 1986 the Soviet Union launched the rst functional, operating space station. Named after the Russian term for peace or world, Mir not only provided a long-term crewed vehicle for experiments, it also allowed scientists to gather invaluable data on what was happening to the astronauts' bodies during previously unexplored lengths of time during a mission. After the fall of the Soviet regime, the Rus- sian space agency, NASA and ESA were able to expand the use of Mir for collaborative mis- sions. Flight times of up to 312 days, with peri- odic measurements, provided a general picture of what was happening, while allowing for in-dividual metabolism, size and age of the astro-nauts. These studies indicated that bone and overall calcium loss resulted from a combina- tion of reduced intestinal absorption of calci- um, increased calcium excretion and increased bone resorption. Markers of bone formation decreased after 14 days of fl ight; but after 60 to 110 days of fl ight, levels were similar to pre- fl ight values. One consistent result seen across the different studies was an increased amount of bone formation markers after the flight, which indicates enhanced metabolic activity. Although microscopic bone tissue samples of astronauts were never tested, these analyses were done in studies of the effects of bedrest on bone mass. Here, biopsies of the iliac crest (part of the pelvis) indicated reduced bone formation activity; however bone formation markers were not decreased. This seeming contradiction is an important reminder to consider and test both site-speci c and systemic activity. Bone Structure Later missions incorporated more detailed study of how and where bone loss occurred within the structure of the bone itself. Bone consists of both compact and spongy tissue. Compact or cortical bone makes up the hard outer layer of bones, and spongy or trabecular bone, which is porous like a sponge to allow blood vessels and other cells to traverse the bone interior, makes up the inner cavity. andre Bone Loss in SpaceSPECIAL REPORT:36 LOOKING UP: Europe's Quiet Revolution in Microgravity Research SPACE CHANNEL / PHIL SAUNDERS, SOURCE DATA: LAURENCE VICOThe rst comprehensive documentation of bone loss by tissue type was taken from two cos- monauts who fl ew in one- and six-month mis- sions, respectively, and was later con rmed on another 15 cosmonauts. In addition to periph- eral quantitative computed tomography (pQCT) of the distal radius in the arm and the tibia in t he leg, ultrasound measurement was performed on the heel bone. After the six-month fl ight, bone loss in the tibia and the heel was more marked than that seen after the one-month fl ight, whereas no loss was observed at all in the radius. Although no change was seen in the ra- dius regardless of mission duration, BMD loss in spongy bone of the tibia was already present after the rst month and continued to deterio- rate with mission duration. Loss of cortical bone tissue in the tibia occurred after a two- month fl ight but was less pronounced than that for trabecular bone. Later, in the year 2000, crew members on In- ternational Space Station missions were subject- ed to BMD testing using QCT measurements of the hip and spine in addition to the routine dual energy X-ray absorptiometry (DXA) measure- ments. Before and after fl ight measurements conducted in 14 astronauts who performed four- to six-month missions showed that they experi- enced substantial loss of both trabecular and cortical bone in the hip and somewhat smaller losses in the spine. Viewing these results as a whole, it seems that there is a gradient of mineral loss begin- ning at the lumbar spine level and becoming progressively greater in the lower limbs, includ- ing the attachment point of the femur and dis- tal tibia but excluding the heel. This progres- sive decline is also characterised by higher per- centage loss of trabecular bone compared with cortical bone. The upper limbs appear to be protected from loss of bone minerals and there have even been surprising reports of increased BMD in the skull ( see Figure 1 ). One reason may be that a redistribution of minerals from the lower to upper body occurs in space as grav- ity no longer exists to pull fl uids to the lower extremities. Another explanation for the absence of bone loss in the radius is that the arms play a greater role in locomotion and in overall movement in space than the legs. So while the lower limbs ex- perience a decrease in use, the upper limbs ex-perience an increase, which may contribute to the skeletal adaptation in both instances. Test results varied widely between individual astro- nauts and no relation with potential confound- ing factors, including previous time spent in space, was found. Measurements were also tak- en during a recovery period equal to the mission length. During recovery, bone loss persisted in the tibia; suggesting that the time needed to re- cover is longer than the mission duration. ABOUT THE AUTHORS Christian Alexandre was educat- ed at the Medical School of Lyon, France. He is currently dean of the medical school and a practicing rheumatologist based at St-Etienne Hospital-University, where he spe- cializes in bony diseases. While at St. Etienne, he developed the Inserm research laboratory dealing with bone adaptation to stressful condi- tions of intensive exercise and weightlessness.

A score below -2.5 is de / PHIL SAUNDERSConfounding Factors These reported losses in bone mass occurred despite physical exercise training. Although these changes have been mainly attributed to decreased body movement and reduced weight bearing, there are other associated factors that contribute to bone loss to unknown degrees. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) evaluation in 16 astronauts on four- to six-month missions showed that muscle volume did not change in the upper body but decreased in the back and legs, with the greatest change in the lower leg. These regional changes in muscle mass seem to mirror those of bone. Researchers have attempted to associate this upper/lower body discrepancy with the afore- mentioned fl uid redistribution caused by micro- gravity. The loss of gravity-induced pressure gradients in the lower body causes fl uids to shift to the upper body. The kidneys, which are the primary regulators of body fl uid volume and composition, respond to the fl uid shift and bone demineralization by increasing the urinary out- put of water, sodium and calcium. This increase in urine production and sodium excretion occurs soon after entering a microgra- vity environment and was thought to contribute to loss of astronauts' body mass. However, continuous daily body mass measurements showed a gradual reduction over the entire mis-sion instead of a rapid loss of 2 to 3 kg at the be- ginning of a mission. Studies of energy (caloric) intake versus energy expenditure have shown that astronauts are burning more calories than they are consuming, resulting in a negative ener- gy balance and a loss in body mass. Insuf cient vitamin K intake (to the best of our knowledge, fresh vegetables were scarce on the Mir space station) seems to also contribute to bone loss. During a 179-day mission, investigators admi- nistered 10 mg of vitamin K to one astronaut from day 86 to day 136. During and after being given the extra vitamin K, bone formation mar- kers increased signi cantly. Other factors that Stripped to the Bone Throughout life, the body continuously destroys and rebuilds bone tissue, a process called remodelling. Two types of cells perform these functions: osteoclasts, the destroyers, and osteoblasts, the builders. Left: Osteoclasts invade the bone's surface and release dis- solving enzymes, which carve out pits in the bone and release calci-um to be reabsorbed. Right: Osteoblasts then swarm into the pit and secrete calcium and proteins to ll it with new boneOsteoclasts OsteoblastsOsteoblasts38 LOOKING UP: Europe's Quiet Revolution in Microgravity Research SCANCO MEDICAL AGmay contribute to bone loss are disruption of cir- cadian rhythms as well as neuromuscular and vestibular systems, but the potential impact on the skeleton have not yet been investigated. Rate of Recovery One year after ISS astronauts returned to Earth, bone mineral testing was again performed on the femur to assess the effects of reexposure to Earth's gravity. Area and volumetric bone min- eral density, bone volume, as well as bone min- eral content (BMC) were evaluated. Results showed that BMC of the femur had recovered, but overall BMD results and estimated bone strength showed only partial recovery. The return of BMC to normal values can be attribut- ed to an increase in bone volume and cross-sec- tional area while BMD remained below normal. Additional research results indicate that re- covery of skeletal density after long-duration space missions may exceed twice the time spent in microgravity conditions. These relatively long recovery periods may be due to the type of bone cells and mechanisms compensating for the over- all loss. The outer layer of bone is the periosteum, and these cells regulate the general outer shape of bone, including length and thickness. Most periosteal expansion takes place during puberty when hormonal changes induce the growth spurt that determines our adult height among other things. Little periosteal growth occurs during advancing age when it serves to partially main- tain the cross-sectional area of bone, so any pe-riosteal compensation in an adult would take a signi cant amount of time. The extent to which this compensatory effect protects against frac-ture, however, remains to be seen. Fracture is one of the key health risks of os- teoporosis, one that usually occurs after the disease has quietly ravaged the body over time. While it will take years for fractures to occur, other symptoms related to fl uid shifts are im- mediately observable when the astronauts re- turn to Earth. Changes in volume and compo- sition of fl uids surrounding muscle cells can cause water retention in those cells, making them swell and become painful. The doctor for the French National Space Agency noted that returning astronauts experienced fl at feet as well as back pains several days after returning from space. Tennis players also said that they systematically hit under the ball on the two or three days after landing. Future Steps To make a better assessment of microgravity's impact on bone, the next research step is to establish the dynamics of skeletal changes dur- ing microgravity exposure as well as under dif- ferent levels of microgravity. Obtaining a better understanding of these effects is especially important in view of the planned Lunar and Mars explorations, as these longer missions will require better prevention strategies. Evaluations of these dynamics require not only measure- ments of bone resorption and formation mark- ers but also repeated assessments of site-specif- ic changes during fl ight to bone volume, miner- al content, density and so on. Because of limited space, a miniaturized pe- ripheral QCT was developed to cortical BMD separately. This appa- ratus has now evolved into a high resolution de- vice able to evaluate the three-dimensional structure of the skeleton ( see Figure 2 ). A 3-D view will allow researchers to validate or refute whether bone resorption in space occurs equal- ly in all planes of trabecular bone. Also un- known is whether the recovery of BMD is uni- form or whether it is selective for the horizontal FIGURE 2. BONE STRUCTURE Representative 3-D reconstruction of the tibia with peripheral QCT show- ing the distinct regions for volumetric BMD evaluation. All planes of bone are visible: the outer cortical area and the two trabecular regions of interest: the inter-mediate area and inner trabecular Trabecular area Cortical area www.spacefl ight.esa.int 39or vertical spongy bones. These answers have important implications for future bone health and risk for potential fractures, especially of the vertebrae and hip. Even if bone density re- covers, the 3-D structure of the bone may be al- tered, which could compromise its architectur- al integrity. In addition, most of the present data have been obtained in men. More data col- lection is needed not only in men but also in women because gender-based differences in bone loss exist. Further studies are also needed to clarify the relationships among the different systems (mus- culoskeletal, neurovestibular, nutritional, car- diovascular, etc). A greater effort a coor- dinated, multidimensional approach, with an ul- timate goal of prevention and rehabilitation, is required in order to design strategies to counter- act the effects or treat as needed, research that will also bene t osteoporosis patients on Earth. Pharmacological interventions have not been routinely used in space. Programmes designed to rectify the effects of microgravity have fo- cused mainly on exercise. However, it is clear that stimulus from exercise has been inadequate to maintain bone mass because of insuf cient load or duration. We know that the number and the amplitude of impacts in orbit are very low compared to those experienced daily on Earth, so any prevention plan should mimic the im- pacts of daily life on Earth in both number of repetitions and magnitude of force applied. The \"required impact dose\" to prevent hip bone mineral density loss has been estimated at 100 impacts per day with a gravitational force of 3.9g, greater than that of Earth at 1g. Future prevention strategies would ideally transiently load the body at more than 1g because of the technical dif culties of loading at 1g through- out the fl ight. Any programme must be sure to maintain the natural operation of muscle and bone as a single unit working against the force of gravity. Extreme situations, including not only microgravity but conditions such as spinal cord injury or myopathy, can disrupt the nor- mal muscle/bone function. Thus, the frequency and regimen of any prevention strategy have to be carefully studied and de ned. Alphabet Soup: DXA, BUA, QCT Several techniques exist for measuring bone mineral density. Below is a brief explanation of what each method entails. DXA: Dual energy X-ray absorptiometry How Results Two X-ray beams with different energy levels are aimed at the patient's body. One of these beams is absorbed mainly by soft tissue and the other by bone. The soft tissue amount can be subtracted from the total and what remains is a patient's bone mineral density (BMD). DXA actually measures areal BMD. True density is calculated using mass divided by volume. DXA results can be adjusted by calculating volume based on the projected area. BUA: Broadband ultrasound attenuation A bony extremity, usually the heel, is placed between two ultrasound transducers, one transmitting and one receiving. The amount of power lost by various frequencies as they travel through bone and soft tissue\u2014called attenuation\u2014is measured.Attenuation as measured in decibels is used to calculate the BUA index, which varies between normal subjects and those with osteoporosis. QCT: Quantitative computed tomography Tomography uses digital geometry processing to generate a three-dimensional image of the inside of an object from a series of two-dimensional X-ray images taken around a single axis of rotation. QCT devices are speci cally designed for high-precision bone measurements.QCT is the only technique that can distinguish between cortical and cancellous bone. It measures volumetric BMD. New bone-dedicated are able to evaluate 3-D structure.40 LOOKING UP: Europe's Quiet Revolution in Microgravity Research Bone Loss in SpaceSPECIAL REPORT: Some reports of in- creased bone density.

SPACE CHANNEL / PHIL SAUNDERS; NASA IMAGES www.spacefl ight.esa.int 41 A Brief History of Bones in Space During the many million of years in which vertebrate animals evolved, the human skeleton gradually stood erect, against the force of earth's gravity. The major role of the skeleton is to serve mechanical needs of the body to move. With the start of manned spacefl ight in the 1960s, changes in bones became apparent very quickly based on bone radiodensitometry measurements during the Gemini and Apollo fl ights. Increased uri-nary calcium and decreased bone mineral density were observed. In the 1980s, better research tools and longer missions, such as on the Russian space station Mir, took bone research much further. Computed tomography was used to measure vertebral BMD (bone mineral density) in four cosmonauts after missions lasting up to seven months; all lost vertebral bone density mainly from the posteri-or vertebra. A dual absorption X-ray photon device showed loss in the spine, femur neck, trochanter (bony crest at the top of the thigh bone) and pelvis of about 1-1.6% per month and 0.3-0.4% per month in the legs and whole body. Starting in 2000, bone investigations were conducted in crew members of the ISS missions using computed tomography measurements of the hip and spine in addition to the routine dual X-ray absorptiometry mea-surements. Pre- and post-fl ight measurements were done in 14 subjects who performed 4- to 6-month missions. ISS crewmembers experienced substantial loss of both trabecular (inner layer) and cortical (outer layer) bone in the hip and somewhat smaller losses in the spine. Taken togeth-er, it seems that there is a gradient of mineral loss beginning at the lum-bar spine level and becoming progressively greater in the lower limbs. Research results indicate that recovery of skeletal density after long-duration space missions may exceed twice the time spent in microgravity conditions. Prevention strategies so far have fo-cused on exercise, but they have been inadequate. Future study must focus on the dynamics of skeletal changes as well as the right type of exercise or preventive movement to combat the loss of gravity. I t C m s o t b m S o h s w s b e b In the 1970s, the Skylab missions were more focused on life science objec-tives, including the study of space-related bone metabolism. Numerous changes were observed: a progressive increase in urinary calcium and then a plateau at 80-100% above normal; calcium balances averaging -200 mg/day on longer Skylab missions; increases in other urinary mark-ers of bone loss of up to 33%. Bone loss in the astronauts' heels was also found. Months after the fl ight was over, the density of the heel bone was still signi cantly lower than normal.You're playing a game of word associa- tion. Your partner says mother; you say father. Your partner says cat; you say dog. Your partner says skeleton; you say ... what? Perhaps you respond with strong, or even Halloween, but you probably do not say sensi- tive. Although we rarely if ever associate it as such, bone tissue is sensitive to its mechanical environment, a condition known as mechano- sensitivity, which allows bone tissue to adapt during the course of a lifetime for more ef cient performance. This adaptation is a cellular pro- cess by which bones alter their mass and struc- ture in response to the demands placed on them; and to adapt, bone tissue needs a system that senses the mechanical load or stress on bones. Then, this loading information must be commu- nicated to the \"effector\" cells that have an active r ole in bone remodelling, or turnover. Bone cells continuously dissolve and then rebuild bone tis- sue. This occurs throughout adult life, where b one tissue is resorbed by osteoclasts and new bone matrix deposited by osteoblasts. The ability of bones to adapt is part of the rea- son why larger animals like elephants have cor- responding wider bones than say, humans. Gali- leo Galilei was probably the rst to describe the role of gravity, i.e., weight, on living organisms. He observed the dimensions of bones from ani- mals of different weights and noted that the length-to-width ratio was remarkably different between light and heavy animals. The very act of carrying body mass around places a heavy me- chanical load on bones. The reverse is also true. If the mechanical load is lower than normal due to situations such as bedrest or immobilization, bone mass decreases in a condition known as dis- use osteoporosis. 42 LOOKING UP: Europe's Quiet Revolution in Microgravity Research ou're playing a game of word associa - tion. Your partner says mot her; you say f a t h e r Y o u rp a r t n e rs a y sc a t y o us a yOur Sensitive Skeleton Since the earliest space fl ights, the negative ef- fect of prolonged weightlessness on astronauts' bones has been of critical concern. Spacefl ight produces a unique condition of skeletal \"unload- ing\" as a result of the near-weightless conditions. Bones are no longer subject to the gravitational pressure normally experienced on Earth, and, like bedrest, this results in bone loss. Experiments performed during spacefl ight have shown that microgravity acts directly on skeletal tissue without the infl uence of systemic factors such as stress hormones ( see Figure 1) . The exact mechanism of how bone loss occurs in spacefl ight is still unknown and many ques- tions remain. How is the lack of gravity detect- ed? Can near-weightless conditions act directly on bone cells? Could certain cells read the grav- itational eld change directly? To answer these questions, the fundamental properties of the way bone cells respond to loading in general have to be addressed. Bearing the Load Although adaptation is a general phenomenon and not speci c for bone tissue, it is intriguing that such a hard and seemingly inert material as bone can be gradually altered during life, and in such a \"sensible\" or sensitive manner. All eukaryotic cells (cells having a nucleus) are probably sensitive in some way and physical factors, including gravity, tension, compres- sion and shear, infl uence growth and remodel- ling in all living tissues. In vertebrates, bone is the tissue best suited to cope with large forces because of its hard but fl exible extracellular matrix, a tough composite material outside the cell walls that provides structural support to the cells in addition to other important func-AT A GLANCE Bone cells can sense the load or stress placed on them and can adapt accord-ing to these mechanical demands. Studies suggest that the rate of the strain or move-ment is more important to building bone than the am-plitude or power required to execute it. These ndings have direct implications for the type of exercise or other preven-tive strategies that may work to counteract the ex-treme \"unloading\" oc-curs in space. \u2014The EditorsHUMAN 43REPRODUCED FROM J BONE MINER RES. 1995;10:550-557 WITH PERMISSION OF THE AMERICAN SOCIETY FOR BONE AND MINERAL RESEARCHGalileo was the rst to notice the effect of weight\u2014or gravity\u2014on bone size. But if bone tissue can sense and react to gravity, how are those proc-esses affected once gravity is removed? By Rommel J.W.A. ensures ef cient load bearing: the daily loads are carried by a surprisingly thin structure. The organisation of the cellular activity behind this adaptation is poorly understood, but over the last few years signi cant progress has been made. These studies emphasize the role of the osteocytes, the most abundant cells in adult bones, as the professional \"sensor\" cells of bone. These load-sensing osteocytes are in contact with each other via their long slender cell \" n- gers\" that reach through tiny canals within bone called canaliculi. The osteocytes themselves lie in a space called a lacuna, Latin for \"pit\" ( see Fig- ures 2 and 3). The space between the cell body, its \" ngers\" and the bone matrix is lled with fl uid. This network of interconnected cells sur- rounded by fluid can efficiently detect local changes in stress. When a heavy load is placed on bone, the result is something like squeezing a wet sponge. The bone becomes deformed and causes fl uid to fl ow through the canaliculi, the osteocytes ( see Figure 4 ) and transports cell signalling molecules, nutrients and waste products. One of these signalling molecules is ni- tric oxide (NO). The quick-responding osteo- cytes react to fl uid fl ow by activating the en- zyme responsible for NO production. FIGURE 1.

During the 4-day culture period, calci cation starts in the centre of the embryonic bone, which is clearly visible as a black spot in the centre (D). The calci ed section of the bone cultured in microgravity was signi cantly smaller than when cultured under Earth's gravity on the centrifuge.

The composi- tion of the bone matrix immediately surround- ing the osteocytes and their attachment to that bone matrix appears to be very important. The bone matrix determines how porous the bone is, and thus the rate and pressure of the fl uid fl ow in response to stress. As stated above, the \" n- gers\" of the osteocytes reach through bone to detect and also amplify deformations that occur with pressure. In addition, osteocytes are capa- ble of producing proteins and \" ller\" substances that exist between cells; so they might also be able to adapt the porosity of the matrix around them as part of the loading response. Osteocyte receptors attached to the extracel- lular bone matrix are prime candidates for mechanosensing. In addition, each osteocyte (as well as all other cells) has its own dynamic skel- etal structure aptly named the cytoskeleton that not only provides scaffolding for the cell, but also contains \"trans-membrane\" proteins, which do as their name implies. They cross the cell membrane to link the internal structure of the cell to the bone matrix outside, and any sen- sation of force is likely registered through the communication of these connector proteins. The rapid release of NO by bone cells under stress makes NO an interesting candidate for communication within the network of bone cells. In addition, the production of the bone matrix protein osteopontin by osteocytes rap- idly increases the amount and timing of chang- es to bones after acute disuse, which may medi- ate bone resorption. Bone cells are not the only cells to exhibit this kind of stress response, and not the only cells to use NO as a signal. In the vascular system, changes in the diameter of arteries occur in re- sponse to changes in rate of blood fl ow in order to ensure a constant vessel tone. (See \"Counter- acting Hypertension with Weightlessness?\" on page 16.) Endothelial cells, which line not only blood vessels but also other internal cavities, are widely recognized as the sensory cells in this case. Like the osteocytes, endothelial cells respond to fl uid fl ow with the release of NO and signalling molecules. While it is surprising that such differ- ent systems seem to use a similar sensory mecha- nism, this concept explains local gains and loss- es in bone as well as the remodelling that occurs after damage. Quality, not Quantity Several studies suggest that the rate of the mechanical strain is more important to bone formation than the magnitude of the strain. Low-magnitude (<10 microstrain), high-fre- quency (10-100 Hz) loading has stimulate bone growth and inhibit disuse osteo- porosis. These data make sense from an evolu- tionary standpoint. Low-amplitude, high-fre- quency stimuli such as that experienced when walking are fairly common in daily life, where- FIGURE 2. OSTEOCYTES. Left: Osteocytes are arranged in concentric circles around a blood vessel. Note the many cell exten-sions ( ngers), radiating from the osteocyte cell bodies (black), in particular in perpendicular direc-tions. Right: Isolated osteocytes in culture form / AMOLFas occasions for high-amplitude, static strain such as lifting heavy objects are more rare. In studies of rats with osteoporosis, bone mass and strength both increased after jumping exer- cises, indicating a frequency-related response in bone formation. In another study, in vivo measurements were taken of the human hip bone while walking and jogging, and the results showed that the strains experienced during these activities have a rich frequency spectrum. This implies that despite the minute level of strain, the speed of the im- pacts when walking or jogging could account for the quality of the exercise. Studies of bone cells showed that the increase in NO correlated linearly to the rate of fl uid shear stress in the canaliculi. That is, bone cells respond better with faster stimuli. This supports the notion that bone formation is stimulated by dynamic rather than static stresses, and that low-magnitude, high-frequency exercise may be as stimulating as high-amplitude, low-frequency exercise. In studies of bone cell responses to vibration stress using a wide frequency range of 5-100 Hz, the release of NO correlated with the maximum ac- celeration rate. This correlation may be related to oscillations of the nucleus, which is more dense than the cytoplasm and more apt to be \"felt,\" providing a physical basis for how cells sense high-frequency loading. The corresponding reaction of bone cells to fl uid shear stress provides a physical rather than evolutionary explanation as to why adaptive bone formation occurs despite the sporadic oc-currence of high-amplitude strains in daily life. Further understanding of how bone cells re- spond to stress might provide a deeper insight on how living bone is able to sustain itself with the occurrence of meagre strains, whereas cul-tured bone cells are known to require greater strain. One explanation may be that sporadic release of a signalling molecule is adequate for sustained bone health. You Can Feel It in Your Bones Although stiff, bone can feel very small levels of strain, possibly even from fl exing the muscles. It makes sense to have healthy muscles along with healthy bones. One study has shown that whole body bone mineral content as an indicator of bone strength correlated to lean body mass as an indicator of muscle strength. This implies that muscle activity can influence healthy bone growth and that bone tissue can be highly sensi- tive to minute strains. As stated earlier, bone pre- fers the quality of stress rather than its quantity. Vibrating plates and ultrasound have also been used to create low-magnitude, high-fre- quency stress, and both methods seem to effec- tively stimulate bone cells; however, how the forces are transferred to the effector cells through soft tissue barriers of skin, muscle and so on is not straightforward. In fact, the stimu- lation of bone cells may not directly result from the transfer of force to the cells themselves. If the intervening soft tissue serves to further weaken an already meagre source of stress, there may be other processes or cellular com- FIGURE 3. OSTEOCYTE MORPHOLOGY.

Scanning Revolution in Microgravity Research VUMC / AMOLFmunication at work to compensate for the slight force transfer. Part of the answer may lie in the relationship between bone cells and the fl uid fl ow that re- sults from stress. Research has indicated that the release of NO and other molecules reaches its peak once a certain threshold of fl uid shear stress is achieved. Bone cells do not react to ev- ery single movement or stress by stimulating bone growth; rather, they can sense the level when it becomes necessary. Bone cells are \"turned on\" when a speci c threshold of stress is reached, which allows these cells to respond appropriately to a \"noisy\" stimulus, such as that experienced in repetitive exercise. Reacting when the proper amount of noise is present is a phenomenon called \"stochastic resonance.\" Just as a person can recognize a familiar face in a crowd of strangers, bone can recognize the \"correct\" stimuli during \"noisy\" exercise. It is possible that bone-building cells adapt to low levels of stress by using the constant background \"noise\" of weak, but repetitive stress as an addi- tional stimulus when the intensity of stress is be- low the threshold necessary for a response. If osteocytes can tune their response for sig- nalling molecules like NO to the type of stress encountered, that ability would explain the ben- e ts of dynamic stress to bone formation. Fur- thermore, the possible role of noisy or stochas-tic stress in bone adaptation provides a partial explanation as to why and how indirect stress helps build bone. These properties indicate a ca- pacity for an enhanced response to even the faintest levels of stress, such as that caused by muscular vibration, ultrasound or vibratory motion, and characterized by low-magnitude high-frequency strain. Response to Cell Deformation The response of the bone cells is not only corre- lated with the magnitude and frequency of the mechanical load, it also depends on the defor-mation of the bone cell under stress, the cytoskeleton and trans-membrane proteins linking the cell to its surroundings and even oth- er cells. Now, studies have shown that, when bone is \"squeezed\" like a sponge under heavy loads, those cells deformed by exposure to fl uid fl ow release more of certain signalling mole- cules compared with cells deformed by the stretching of bony surfaces to which they are attached. Cellular deformation caused by fl uid flow is fundamentally different from that induced by surface stretching. Fluid shear stress has a greater effect on the bone cells, while the effect of surface strain is focused on the cell- surface attachments. We have observed the process of cell deforma- tion in a simple laboratory model. In the body, osteocytes are attached to the extracellular ma- trix, and they sense a load or force once that ma-trix starts to deform under the stress of the load. At this point, the osteocytes adapt by pulling on the attachment sites. In the lab, we attached a single cell fl oating in medium to small spheres of 2.5 microns on its opposite ends. By wiggling one of the spheres or beads, the cell is made to experience minute forces of less than a tenth of the cell's weight. However, the traction force in- duced by the osteocytes themselves is relatively high\u2014more than twice their own weight\u2014and they release NO simultaneously with increasing force application. We also observed that the cells adapt to the traction force by changing their morphology from a spherical to an elongated shape. These experiments demonstrate a strong link between the processes involved in force sensing and force induction as well as the release of signalling molecules by cells. Use It or Lose It Findings that the rate of mechanical loading is more important than magnitude for bone health have powerful implications on the local activity of osteocytes in directing adaptation. Under ex treme conditions of unloading such as near- weightlessness, it might be possible to counter- act the onslaught of bone loss with sporadic FIGURE 4. SIGNAL DETECTION When a heavy load is placed on bone, the bone tissue squeezes like a sponge and fl uid fl ows through pores called canaliculi. This fl uid fl ow is essential for osteocytes to \"sense\" the load or stress and respond appropriately.

CORVAJA 2004bouts of rapid-impact exercise, since the \"qual- ity\" of exercise as recognized by bone would depend on the speed of the strain, despite the minute amount. Currently, bone loss prevention is based on either exercise or pharmaceutical applications, but the approach must eventually target the bone cells. As discussed, bone loss results from a disturbance in stress levels, the amount of signalling molecules released, and their roles for directing local bone remodelling. Since these parameters are closely related, it might be possible to restore their stability despite extreme conditions of unloading. Scientists have considered whether bone cells are able to read the changes in the gravitational force directly or detect these changes indirectly via contact stresses. It seems that the light weight of cells undermines the role of gravity in their behaviour. At the molecular level, gravity has only a small role because movements are de- termined by diffusion (Brownian motion) or by speci c molecules that induce much higher forc- es compared with the weight of the molecules themselves. Thus, the question remains as to how osteocytes might detect near weightless- ness directly. Studies have also shown that the organisation of the cytoskeleton is gravity dependent and that this organisation may affect particle transport within the cell. Any reorganisation of cellular components has implications on properties like elasticity and viscosity, which would affect how the cells sense forces. If gravity affects the rela- tion between cytoskeletal organisation and in-tracellular transport, then the gain or loss of those forces\u2014and corresponding impact on structure and transport\u2014may enable cells to di- rectly detect gravitational changes. Thus, it is possible that the signal for gravity fl uctuations comes from inside the osteocytes and these cel- lular changes infl uence bone cell sensitivity. Apart from the obvious disuse effects of mi- crogravity, the effect of spacefl ight on fl uid dis- tribution in the human body may be another consideration. Without gravity to pull blood and other fl uids to the lower part of the body, these fl uids move more freely to the torso and head. There are data suggesting that, in humans, bone mineral loss during spacefl ight is unevenly distributed throughout the body, being most pronounced in the legs and pelvis. In the head only a small but signi cant increase in bone mineral density has been observed. Thus, chang- es in bone mineral density seem to correlate with changes in interstitial fl uid pressure. In this model, reduced fl uid pressure leads to reduced fl uid fl ow through the canaliculi, whereas in- uid pressure would increase fl uid fl ow. This is compatible with bone loss in the former situation and bone gain in the latter, which pro- vides indirect evidence for a relationship be- tween fl uid pressure and bone balance. Current- ly no direct studies are underway to link these two properties, but it may be worthwhile to an- alyze a possible relationship, and manned space- fl ight studies could offer unique conditions to test this hypothesis. Conclusion Tremendous progress has been made toward understanding the function of osteocytes since the rst experiments on bone loss in astronauts were performed. Information has increased regarding their potential functions and response to strain. Molecular mechanisms and pathways involved in osteocyte mechanosensation have been identi ed and expanded signi cantly. It remains to be determined whether the loss of gravity affects the way these cells sense forces, leading to bone loss during spaceflight. The future of scienti c study in this area looks excit- ing with great potential for discoveries surround-ing the osteocytes' role in sensing stress and their function under microgravity. New insights will help to develop treatment strategies to prevent dangerous bone loss in astronauts. Ebb and Flow On April 19, 2004, the Dutch Soyuz Mission \"DELTA\" (Dutch Expedition for Life Science, Technology and At- mospheric Research) was launched on its way to the Inter-national Space Station. On it was the authors' entry into bi-ological experiments in microgravity. Called the \"Flow\" experiment, it was designed to test whether the osteocytes' production of NO and other signalling molecules changes when in microgravity versus when on Earth. Cultures in fl ight were subjected to both microgravity and simulated Earth gravity using a centrifuge inside the Kubik incubator. Control cultures on the ground were subjected to identical culture environment and stress stimulations. Unfortunately, hardware malfunction resulted in a lack of electronic power to fl ight containers. Despite this setback, the preparations for the experiment indicate that this setup is viable for a fu-ture fl ight opportunity. The experiment has been consid-ered as a potential candidate by the European Space Agen-cy for one of the next Soyuz missions.

This reflects the company's recognition of the key importance of this research not only for its application to our Earth-based concerns in developing new industrial processes and materials and the better understanding of human health issues, but also with its importance for future human exploration of the Solar System. Recognising the importance of the huge opportunities for research offered by the International Space Station, OHB has been involved in the preparation of this research through its involvement in six Shuttle missions, four MIR missions and the Eureca mission. OHB is the second largest German company involved in the construction of the International Space Station (ISS) and the only European partner involved in all of the scientific payloads for the Columbus module of the ISS Biolab, the European Physiology Modules, the Fluid Science Laboratory, the Materials Science Laboratory and the European Modular Cultivation System. Beginning with the CEBAS minimodule being developed by OHB, under a contract with the German space agency, DLR, the first closed aquatic life support system was established. Since this time OHB has developed the AquaHab\u00ae-System as a model ecosystem for Earth bound environmental risk assessment of new chemicals and products. The Space Exploration initiative is one of the foremost challenges for the space industry. OHB is focused on activities that are both relevant to exploration as well for Earth applications. New strategies in energy conversion, biomimetic new expedition structures and other technologies demonstrate the innovative character of OHB in meeting new challenges on Earth and in space.High-precision experiments performed in space will put some of Einstein's theories to the test. By Stefano Vitale, Christophe Salomon and Wolfgang Ertmer Gravity is everywhere. It is the reason an apple falls to the ground and why galaxies gather in clusters stretching across mil- lions of light-years. It pervades the universe, despite being the weakest of the four fundamental forces. Thanks to Einstein and his theory of general relativ- ity, our understanding of gravity has progressed enormously. Since the publication of his theory in 1916, a number of experiments and observations have con rmed many of its basic tenets.PHYSICS FUNDAMENTALS 50 LOOKING UP: Europe's Quiet Revolution in Microgravity ResearchTiming Gravity AT A GLANCE Gravity is a universal force that acts consistently on all bodies; Galileo proved two bodies fall to Earth at the same rate. All experiments in physics yield in free fall the same results as in the absence of gravity. Atomic clocks use atomic resonances to measure time and can accurately test Einstein's predictions. Gravity limits their accuracy because atoms \"fall\" past the sensor. On the ISS, the atoms \"fl oat\" longer near the sensor for more precise measurement. Einstein said that when matter accelerates it emits gravitational waves. Satellites in development will allow the detection of these ripples as they pass by, a gravita-tional snapshot of the universe. What happens if future testing shows that Einstein's theories are slightly off? Many theorists are hoping for that to get a hint on how to reconcile gravity and the quan-tum world, an unsolved fundamental question in our understanding of the universe. \u2014The EditorsSPACE CHANNEL / PHIL SAUNDERS www.spacefl ight.esa.int 51 52 LOOKING UP: Europe's Quiet Revolution in Microgravity Research SPACE CHANNEL / PHIL SAUNDERSHowever in some key situations, gravity re- mains poorly understood, such as within the vi- olent environment of a black hole. Here, condi- tions are so extreme that nothing escapes the black hole's grasp except gravitational waves! In addition, how gravity operates within the limits of quantum mechanics, something that must have occurred during the very early stages of the universe, is still a mystery. One of the most dif cult tasks for physicists today is measuring gravity with suf cient preci- sion to understand how it works at these ex- treme boundaries of our knowledge. An upcom- ing experiment onboard the International Space Station and others on a series of sophisticated space probes may provide some answers.

Timely Measurements In the late 16th century Galileo Galilei recog- n ized that in a vacuum, objects of different weights, such as a cannonball and a feather, fall toward the centre of the Earth accelerating at exactly the same rate of 9.81 m/sec2. So, in practical terms, if you fall off a cliff during a mountain hike one thing you wouldn't have to worry about is losing your rucksack or camera because they will fall with you at exactly your rate of descent (ignoring any effects of air resis- tance). They will appear to \"fl oat\" around you as you plunge toward the ground, almost as if gravity doesn't exist. Known as the principle of equivalence, this condition is a fact of life on the ISS. Astronauts, Top: In space under microgravity conditions, an atom can be kept in an observable volume for up to tens of seconds. On the ISS, atoms can be sent slowly across a two-microwave eld zone set to the frequency of the quantum jump between energy levels. Bottom: On Earth, gravity takes over and after just one-tenth of a sec-ond the atom is falling at 1 m/sec, and it keeps accelerating downward. www.spacefl ight.esa.int 53nuts, bolts and bits of equipment all appear to fl oat as if gravity has been switched off. In real- ity, everything is in free fall, even the space sta- tion itself. As it falls, however, it moves forward fast enough that it never actually plummets Earthward. It keeps falling past Earth as it or- bits the planet. For many experiments the ability to elimi- nate gravity is a major advantage, and for many researchers, the ISS provides an excellent labo- ratory to study natural phenomena without the impediment of gravity . T ake clocks, for in- stance: they are a key instrument in the study of gravity. Atomic Flip-out Atomic clocks are the most precise clocks that exist. They use resonance frequencies of atoms in certain elements, usually caesium or rubidium, to keep extremely accurate time. Today our def- inition of a unit of time is based on exposing a free-fl ying, undisturbed atom of caesium-133 to microwaves. Quantum mechanics tells us that when the energy of the microwave signal is equal to the energy separating two quantum states of the caesium atom, the atom fl ips from one state to the other. One second of time is de ned as 9,192,631,770 times the period of oscillation of the microwave signal that makes a caesium atom fl ip between two of its quantum states. However, this applies only to undisturbed at- oms, which is a fundamental limitation. The problem is that when an atom is released on Earth, gravity takes over. The atom acquires a speed of one metre per second in just one-tenth of a second, and it accelerates downward with every passing moment. So the best a physicist can do is to make a brief observation as the atom zips past a detector. To obtain more accurate measurements, the atom needs to be observed for the longest possible time. In the microgravity environment of space, an atom can be kept in an observable volume for up to tens of seconds. On the ISS, atoms can be slowly launched in free fl ight across a two-mi- crowave- eld zone tuned to \"magic\" quan- tum-fl ip frequency\u2014the frequency of the quan- tum jump between the energy levels of the at- oms being used for the clock\u2014and observed for many seconds. This is the feature that will be exploited by the Atomic Clock Ensemble in Space (ACES), to be located on the external platform of the Co- lumbus module on the ISS in 2012. Laser beams will cool caesium atoms; the slow atoms and their low acceleration in microgravity will allow observation times signi cantly longer than is possible on Earth. ACES is expected to reach an accuracy of 1 part in 10 16 (one followed by 16 zeros). In terms of time, this is equivalent to a clock being off by one second every 200,000 million years! The Relativity of Time One of the predictions of general relativity is that gravity affects clocks and the measurement of time. Actually it is not just gravity. Relativity also dictates that the speed of light\u2014the dis- tance light travels per unit of time\u2014is the same for all observers: 299,792,458 m/sec. It may not be obvious, but this also affects the measure- ment of time. Suppose a beam of light travels from the nal car to the engine of a rapidly moving train just as it passes through a station. To an observer on the train, the light will travel precisely the length of the train in X amount of time. But to an ob- server standing on the platform while the train passes by, that same light beam will travel the length of the train plus the distance travelled by the train during the experiment. As the velocity of light is the same for both observers, the clock of the person on the platform must measure a time longer than X. The time between events, the emission and collection of the light beam, is different for observers who see each other mov- ing at velocities greater than zero. Just as velocity affects clocks, so does grav- ity. Compare for instance a clock on the top of a tower with an identical one placed at its bot- tom. Each time the bottom clock ticks, it also sends out a fl ash of light, so that while sitting at the tower top, you can compare the ticks of the bottom clock, as marked by the fl ashes, with those of the clock at the top. To avoid being con- fused by the effects of gravity, imagine the ob- server is free falling, which cancels out the ef- fects of gravity. While the observer accelerates downward, he sees the tower and the clocks ac- celerating upward. With the tower top moving further away with constantly increasing speed, the fl ashing light that is travelling at constant velocity will have to cover a constantly increas- ing distance. The fl ashes will thus be received at longer time intervals than those with which they have been emitted. The bottom clock appears to run slower than the top one. This may seem like a theoretical exercise, but it is something that cannot be ignored even in daily life. If you navigate using a global posi-54 LOOKING UP: Europe's Quiet Revolution in Microgravity Research SPACE CHANNEL / PHIL SAUNDERStioning system (GPS), and the software doesn't correct for gravity and the satellite's velocities, your GPS will locate you many kilometres from your actual position. The ticking of clocks in different gravitation- al elds is so rooted in our understanding of the principle of equivalence and the general theory of relativity that it has been tested repeatedly with ever-increasing precision. The most accu- rate measurements to date have been obtained by NASA's Gravity Probe A. A hydrogen maser (microwave laser) atomic clock was launched on a two-hour suborbital rocket fl ight to an altitude of 10,000 kilometres. The time of the onboard clock was compared with two identical maser clocks on the ground. Einstein's theory was con- rmed to an accuracy of 70 parts per million. ACES, with its more precise clock, is de- signed to improve Gravity Probe A's test of the theory of relativity by as much as a factor of 30, thereby providing a new challenge to Einstein's theories. Relative Gravity Running experiments in microgravity can be useful. Free fall \"turns off\" gravity and actual- ly improves the operation of some instruments. But for scientists studying gravity itself, this cancellation is not a good thing. To make mat- ters worse, it turns out that free fall is unavoid- able. This not a paradox. For example, we all fall together, with the Earth, around the sun. Thus on Earth, the gravity of the sun (and any other celestial body) is turned off and so cannot be measured. However, the cancellation of gravity in free fall is not perfect. For instance the sun's gravity pulls everything toward its centre. Thus falling particles will converge toward that point and their paths will not be parallel. Also, objects close to the sun feel a more intense gravitation- al pull than do objects farther away, which causes greater acceleration for the closer objects. The result is a compromise: most of the sun's gravity is cancelled by free fall, but small, local- ized differences remain. On our planet, these slight differences squeeze and pull Earth's oceans, resulting in the small relative accelera- tions that we know as tides\u2014the only measur- able effect of the sun's gravity on Earth. Thus, in free fall gravity causes relative accel- eration of nearby free-falling particles, which, in its absence, would otherwise continue moving at constant relative velocity. It was Einstein in his general theory of relativity who pointed out that this acceleration is the basic effect of gravity. If a beam of light travels through a fast-moving train as it speeds through a station, the time for the light to travel from one end of the train to the other will be different for an observer on the train versus one standing on the platform. To the person on the train, the light travels the length of the train only in X time. But to the person on the platform, that same light travels the length of the train plus the distance travelled by the train. On our planet, these slight differences squeeze and pull Earth's oceans, resulting in the small relative accelerations that we know as tides\u2014 the only measurable effect of the sun's gravity on Earth. www.spacefl ight.esa.int 55SPACE CHANNEL / PHIL SAUNDERSImagine two of these free-falling particles and plot their separation as a function of time. The result is a graph of space-time: one axis is a space coordinate, the other is time. If the particles are moving at a constant velocity, then the distance the particles travel is proportional to the time elapsed, and the plot is just a straight line. In ordinary, fl at space, a straight line is the shortest path between two points and is called a geodesic. In four-dimensional space-time (where there are three directional coordinates plus time), things are a bit more complicated, but still, in the absence of gravity, a straight line is a geodesic. So in the absence of gravity, particles follow geode- sics in space-time. However, if gravity acceler- ates one particle relative to the other, the rate of their separation change varies with time, and the plot bends away from a straight line. In the theory of relativity, Einstein showed that particles even in this case still follow geo- desics. Because gravity curves space-time, how- ever, geodesics are no longer straight lines. This is similar to what happens when a particle is moving on the curved surface of a sphere. The shortest path between two points is not a straight line but an arc of a circle with same radius as the sphere. Ripples in Space-Time While Einstein's theory of relativity is our best model for explaining gravity, some of its predic- tions are mind-boggling. For instance it pre- dicts that when matter accelerates, it causes rip- ples of curvature in space-time. These space- time ripples move at the speed of light and are known as gravitational waves. Intense gravitational waves were likely gen- erated during the Big Bang, but there are other candidate sources, for example, two black holes orbiting each other. Such pairs are expected to be quite common as there is strong evidence that almost every galaxy carries, at its centre, a gi- gantic black hole up to billions of times the mass of the sun. And galaxies often collide as they Some evidence strongly suggests that every galaxy has a black hole at its centre that is up to billions of times the mass of the sun. Because galaxies often collide, their core black holes could form a binary system. If two black holes do merge, a powerful burst of gravitational waves would occur. 56 LOOKING UP: Europe's Quiet Revolution in Microgravity Research SPACE CHANNEL / PHIL SAUNDERSwander through the universe, which gives their core black holes the opportunity to form a bi- nary system. If two black holes eventually merge, the result will be a powerful burst of gravitational waves. Gravity waves are not just theoretical con- structs. In 1974 a binary pulsar was discovered, in which the two stars are slowly spiralling in to- ward each other. This will happen if the system loses energy by emitting gravitational waves. It turns out that the stellar pair's inward spiral is occurring at exactly the rate predicted by gener- al relativity. So astronomers have detected a sig- nature result of gravitational waves but not the waves themselves. That may soon change. In the upcoming ESA-NASA mission called LISA (Laser Interferometer Space Antenna), three pairs of gold-platinum particles will be set at the apexes of a triangle ve million kilo- metres on a side. These pairs of free-falling particles, when hit by a gravitational wave, will feel a tiny oscillating acceleration (relative to each other). A very precise motion sensor (a laser interferometer) will be able to detect an oscillation of the relative acceleration of these particles in the range of one billionth of a bil- lionth of the acceleration caused by the Earth's gravity. When LISA is operational (perhaps as early as 2019), it will open a new observational win- dow on the universe. Astronomers hope to de- tect gravitational waves generated by the earli- est moments of the birth of the universe. Signals from the supermassive black-hole binaries scat- tered across the universe will help scientists probe the large-scale structure of the cosmos. The death of small objects spiralling into a black hole will generate gravitational waves that should provide a map of the gravitational eld surrounding the hole. In short, astronomers will nally get a close look at how gravity be- haves in extreme conditions. All Things Considered Equal The principle of equivalence is such a central pil- lar of our understanding of how the universe behaves that it is legitimate to ask the limits of its validity. On Earth it has been demonstrated In one upcoming mission, astronomers hope to detect gravitational waves created during the birth of the uni- verse. Called LISA (Laser Interferometer Space Antenna), the NASA-ESA project will use three pairs of plati-num and gold particles set in a triangle. These particle pairs can feel tiny oscillating accelerations relative to one another if they are hit with these waves. www.spacefl ight.esa.int 57that this principle is obeyed to at least the 13th decimal point. In other words, the measured accelerations from all the physical systems that have been studied fall within this very small margin of error. However, this is about the lim- it that can be reached in a standard laboratory on Earth because of the constraints of gravity. So the French Space Agency, in collaboration with ESA, is developing a satellite called Micro- scope to test how well the principle of equiva- lence is obeyed in space\u2014with an accuracy 100 times greater than what can be accomplished on Earth. Two pairs of solid test-masses made from different materials will free fall in Earth's orbit, and their acceleration will be measured with an accuracy of one part in one thousand billion. Can the study be pushed even further? How well might the principle of equivalence hold up for small quantum particles and not just for or- dinary, solid matter? Can a test comparing the rate of fall of just a few isolated atoms be per- formed? Chilled Out According to quantum mechanics, matter can behave like particles or waves. As a wave, light can pass through a grating or slit in an optical device and create interference patterns. Similar- ly, an atom behaving as a wave can create inter-ference patterns. In an atom interferometer the gratings and the slits are created by cleverly com- bined laser beams that guide the atoms along a determined path. For an atom-wave, its wavelength is directly related to its velocity. Any acceleration of the atom will alter its wavelength and cause changes in the interference patterns, making an interfer- ometer ideal to detect tiny acceleration differ- ences between free-falling atoms. So in theory a quantum-level test of the principle of equiva- lence is possible, but can it be carried out? Interferometers for atoms are not easy instru- ments to work with. Because the atom's wave- length is inversely proportional to its velocity, and because the larger the wavelength the more precise the measurements can be, the slower the atom moves through the interferometer, the bet- ter. The challenge is to create an environment conducive to very slow-moving atoms, and that turns out to be a cold environment. This is achieved with laser cooling, a tech- nique that uses laser light as a braking mecha-nism to slow the velocity of the atoms to as low as a few millimetres per second. (In comparison, the random velocities of atoms in a gas at room temperature and standard pressure can be a few hundred metres per second). In microgravity, this speed limit can be pushed even lower, per- haps to less than 0.001 mm/sec. This is the speed at which atoms move when the temperature is less than one hundred billionth of a degree above absolute zero (approximately -273\u00ba C). Various research groups are actively develop- ing space-borne, cold-atom interferometers. ESA supports some of these studies through its ELIPS research program. Prototypes have al- ready been tested in free fall, albeit for the short duration achievable on a drop tower in Bremen, Germany (a facility where an experimental cap- sule is dropped from a great height in order to achieve a few seconds of free-fall). When these experiments nally arrive at the ISS or some other space-borne platform, the principle of equivalence will meet a new challenge. What a Drag One complication is that the ISS does not actu- ally provide a perfect, gravity-free environment. Mundane disturbances, like the residual drag of Earth's upper atmosphere on the ISS, will accel- erate the station out of its trajectory. A perfect zero-gravity situation can be achieved only if no other force acts on the laboratory itself. Admit- tedly, it is not necessary for these external forc- es to be exactly zero. If they can be measured, it might be possible to compensate for them. This is the idea behind the so-called \"drag- free\" technique that forms the basis of the ideal gravitational lab. It consists of a small but heavy test mass fl oating freely inside a spacecraft. A gravitationally quiet environment is created in the neighbourhood of this test mass so that it falls as freely as possible under the infl uence of gravity alone. A position sensor\u2014a laser inter- ferometer or a proximity sensor\u2014measures the position of the test mass relative to the space- craft without making physical contact. If non- gravitational forces such as air drag or solar-ra- diation pressure act on the spacecraft, the test mass will appear to accelerate. To compensate, the spacecraft's engines are activated to adjust its fl ight path to follow the test mass. As a result the spacecraft tracks the pure free-fall trajecto- ry of the test mass and counteracts any external disturbances. Trying to gently adjust something as massive as the ISS is pretty much an impossible task. Thus, any experiment, such as one testing the principle of equivalence or searching for gravita- tional waves, that needs a perfect free-fall envi- How well might the principle of equivalence hold up for small quantum particles and not just for ordinary, solid matter? Can a test comparing the rate of fall of just a few isolated atoms be performed? 58 LOOKING UP: Europe's Quiet Revolution in Microgravity Research ESA ronment will require a special drag-free satellite. In the case of Microscope, the spacecraft will use tiny ionic microthrusters, which adjust the craft via the recoil from a jet of metal ions forced from an onboard liquid reservoir. The force required to compensate for the atmospheric drag present in low Earth orbit is miniscule\u2014on the order of 10 millinewtons. This is less than the force need- ed to lift an ordinary sheet of paper. LISA's requirements are even more demand- ing: an environment for its free-falling particles that is almost one thousand times more strin- gent than for Microscope. A disturbance equal to the force necessary to lift a small bacterium will disrupt LISA's measurements! Although LI- SA's interplanetary environment will be much quieter than Microscope's (because LISA will be situated farther from Earth), it is valid to ask if LISA's particle pairs can really be set in mo- tion along pure space-time geodesic tracks with such minimal relative acceleration from outside forces. Such a question can only be answered by a test, and unfortunately the experiment can be performed only in the microgravity of space. This dif cult task belongs to LISA Path nder.Challenging Einstein What happens if the results of any of these tests disagree with principles of the theory of relativ- ity or, at a more fundamental level, with the principle of equivalence? If that is the case, phys- icists will have to consider other theories or new fundamental interactions. Theorists are not waiting for experimental results. Instead, they are continuing to try to model the behaviour of gravity in extreme con- ditions where quantum physics comes into play. Some of these models predict extremely weak interactions between particles. If this is the case, precise measurements, such as those about to be attempted, may reveal tiny deviations from the principle of equivalence and the other basic principles of general relativity. Such deviations would give physicists their rst real indication of gravity's behaviour at the quantum level, which dominated the early stages of the Big Bang and a concept that Einstein was unable to come to terms with. The general theory of rela- tivity has stood the test of time remarkably well. But perhaps now we can nally begin to probe its limits. Probing Gravity Three European projects designed to probe gravity are already underway. LISA Path nder will pave the way for a major ESA/ NASA mission planned for the near future: LISA (Laser Interfer-ometer Space Antenna), whose goal is detecting gravitational waves generated by massive objects such as black holes. It consists of two test-masses in a nearly perfect gravita- tional free-fall, and of controlling and measuring their motion with unprecedented accuracy. Such technologies are essential not only for LISA; they also lie at the heart of any future space-based test of Einstein's theory of general relativity. ACES (Atomic Clock Ensemble in Space) will bring a new generation of atomic clocks in the microgravity environment of the ISS. The ACES payload will distribute a stable and accu-rate time base that will be used for space-to-ground as well as ground-to-ground clock comparisons. The direct comparison of ultra-precise atomic clocks is crucial for the exploitation of ACES potential in many different areas of research. MICROSCOPE (MICRO Satellite \u00e0 tra\u00een\u00e9e Compens\u00e9e pour l'Observation du Principe d'Equivalence) is a part the microsatellite line of CNES (Centre National d'\u00c9tudes Spa-tiales, France).

Without gravity to inter-fere, surface tension and capillary forces can be better studied, controlled and measured in small volumes. Fluid sprays can also be better studied without gravity to affect their mo-tion; results can be applied to cooling systems in elec-tronics and jet engines.

Removing gravity from this complex equation allows for new and exciting research in this area. May the capillary force be with you! By Michael Dreyer, Ilia Roisman, Cameron Tropea and Bernhard Weingartner Just after midday on the 17th January, 2008, a British Air- ways Boeing 777 made its nal approach to London's Heathrow Airport. At 220 metres in elevation and 3.2 kilo- metres from touchdown, the autothrottle demanded increased thrust from both engines. Nothing happened. The pilots took over but could do nothing. After skimming across the roofs of nearby houses, the aircraft thumped into the grass border some 300 metres short of the runway. The 152 passengers and crew left the plane via the emergency exits, terri ed and bewildered by what had happened. And what did happen? In May, the Air Accidents Investigation Branch concluded, \". . . that both engines had low fuel pressure at the inlet to the HP [high-pressure] pump. Restrictions in the fuel system between the aircraft fuel tanks and each of the engine HP pumps, resulting in reduced fuel fl ows . . . work has commenced on developing a more complete understanding of the dynamics of the fuel as it fl ows from the fuel tank to the engine.\" Understanding how fl uids work really does matter. It touches our lives in ways that we do not realise: from the beauty of grav- ity-defying water droplets clinging to buds and twigs on a damp spring morning to fl uid fl ow choking in a high-pressure pump in- side an aircraft engine. Although we have learned a great deal about fl uid fl ows during many years of patient research, much of the science still remains mysterious. Venturing into space to dis- entangle gravity from the equation opens up exciting new ave- nues of research and provides greater insights into this fascinat- ing subject.SPACE CHANNEL / PHIL SAUNDERS62 LOOKING UP: Europe's Quiet Revolution in Microgravity Research SPACE CHANNEL / PHIL SAUNDERSThe Basics of a Strange Brew Fluids are strange. A liquid lls a glass above its rim but does not overfl ow. An insect scuttles across the surface of a pond as if walking on sol- id concrete. How is this possible? Every molecule in a liquid is pulled equally in all directions, resulting in a net force of zero. At the liquid's surface, however, a molecule is attracted more by the interior fl uid than by the outside environment. But the force that pulls the molecule toward the liquid's interior is bal- anced by the resistance of the fl uid to compres- sion, which causes the surface of a liquid to be- have like a stretched elastic membrane. This ef- fect is called surface tension (attraction), which in turn gives rise to capillary forces (adhesion). These forces can be stronger than gravity; this is interfacial fl uid fl ow in action. The impor- tance of these forces increases dramatically in fl ows over short scales (length or distance cov- ered), but at smaller and smaller scales the in- vestigation of such fl ows becomes increasingly dif cult to control or measure. This situation changes in microgravity, and even in fl ows over long scales, the infl uence of capillary forces can remain signi cant. This is why microgravity represents a powerful tool for scienti c research in this eld. And what better place to start than with spacecrafts themselves, since in the absence of gravity they are affl icted by numerous fl uid fl ow problems. To Boldly Flow All spacecrafts, whether simple meteorologic satellites or complex space stations, are depen- dent on and limited by fl uid fl ow physics and engineering technology. Spacecraft components such as propellant tanks, heat-transfer units and life-support systems contain liquids, and these liquids must be moved around. In micro- gravity the effects of natural convection, sedi- mentation, buoyancy and hydrostatic pressure are signi cantly altered and cannot be used to position, pump, separate, stratify or destratify fl uids\u2014with or without free surfaces. Fortunately, in the absence of gravity capil- lary forces can be much more dominant than on Earth. These forces can be used to pump and position liquids without the necessity of mov- ing parts or hydrostatic pressure. For example, capillary channels (liquid-acquisition devices) are widely used in propellant-management sys- tems to position and pump liquid toward exter- nal thrusters. The advantage of this technique is that the inlet may be anywhere along the axis of the fl ow channel. As long as the bulk of the liquid is connected to the channel, liquid can be with- drawn. Additional devices, such as re llable res- ervoirs, ensure that bubble-free liquid is provided to the spacecraft's thrusters. An important pre- requisite to designing and using such devices is a fundamental understanding of how to model structures that contain liquids with partially free surfaces for propellant management in space. A simple containment structure is called a parallel-plate capillary channel ( see Figure 1 ). Two liquid menisci (the curved surface of a standing liquid) are formed between parallel plates. External forces, such as a pressure drop created by a pump, drive the flow of liquid through the channel. Due to pressure gradients Capillary forces allow this water droplet to defy gravity. www.spacefl ight.esa.int 63along the channel's axis, the curvature of the free surface changes in the direction of the fl ow. At a certain fl ow rate, surface pressure can no longer be balanced by internal pressure, and the surfaces collapse. For reasons not yet fully un- derstood, this stability limit depends on the ge- ometry of the channel and the properties of the liquid. So a key goal of ongoing research is to nd and explain these limits. Choking on Fluid Flows To understand the interaction of fl ow with a free surface, several parallel-plate experiments were conducted in the low-gravity environment of a drop tower and non-orbiting, short-duration sounding rockets. A silicon fl uid was used with a fl ow rate that varied between 4 and 8.4 ml/sec. Videos were shot during the fl ight of the Tex- us-37 sounding rocket, which provided six min-utes of microgravity time. When fl ow rates are below a critical value, the free surface remains stable and its curvature increases with increasing fl ow rate. If the steady- fl ow velocity at the throat of the fl ow path is in- creased above a critical value, ingestion of gas occurs and the fl ow rate of the liquid is restrict-FIGURE 1. STABLE AND UNSTABLE FL OWS THROUGH PARALLEL-PLATE CHANNELS 1a. Above is an illustration of a stable fl ow through a parallel-plate capillary channel where the fl uid enters the system at the inlet and leaves at the outlet. The curvature of the free surfaces at the sides of the chan- nel changes in the direction of the fl ow. Free surfaceOutlet cases of fl ow through a parallel-plate channel like that in 1a, but the view is from the top looking down on the channel. The liquid fl ows from the bottom to the top and the free surfaces can be seen along the left and right sides of each image. In the top row, the increasing fl ow rate also increases the con- striction of the free surface, but a steady fl ow through the outlet is maintained. In the bottom row, as the fl ow rate increases, the pressure of the free surface along the out-side can no longer be balanced by the internal pressure. The free surface collapses and gas inges-tion occurs. This leads to un-steady two-phase fl ow outlet.64 LOOKING UP: Europe's Quiet Revolution in Microgravity Researched. This phenomenon is called choking and sim- ilar effects can be seen elsewhere. For example, when the velocity of a compressible gas fl ow reaches the speed of sound in the throat of a nozzle, the fl ow rate cannot be increased and choking occurs. During the fl ight of sounding rocket Texus- 41, surface oscillations were observed that helped to explain the effects of transient chang- es on liquid fl ow rate. In an unsteady fl ow such as liquid acceleration and os- cillation occur and result in changes in veloci- ties, as well as a decrease in the maximum fl ow rate compared with the steady fl ow rate. The methods for predicting the free-surface shape and the critical fl ow rate were validated by these tests and can now be used to design liquid-ac- quisition devices for propellant management in space or other applications. Based on these re- sults, the theory of choking has been modi ed. On the other hand, choking does not neces- sarily cause surface collapse. When the liquid velocity reaches the limiting value, a supercriti- cal fl ow regime is achieved. In other words, the fl ow velocity is greater than the wave velocity and an unsteady, supercritical stable fl ow is temporarily possible. Thus nes ow. The super- critical stability limit is given by the dynamic in- dex, which is de ned by the pressure interaction and reaches a value of one for unstable fl ow. Capillary fl ows in different channels and with different fl ow modes will be studied on- board the International Space Station in the Mi- crogravity Science Glovebox (MSG) with the Capillary Channel Flow (CCF) experiment be- ginning in 2010. This experiment is a coopera- tive venture between NASA and the German aerospace centre (the DLR). A Not-So-Simple Shower When a spray of water in your shower hits the wall, the result is something called an inertia- driven fl ow. It may look simple, but it's not. For example, the spray impact also involves the transfer of heat from the spray to the wall. This exchange has a wide range of important appli- cations from cooling high-power electronics on Earth to the design of spacecrafts, which also have to work in high-temperature extremes. Because the hydrodynamics of inertia-driven fl ows on rigid walls is not completely under- stood, the infl uence of gravity on the outcome of spray impact is not clear. When spray hits a rigid wall, a thin, fl uctuating liquid fl ow is cre- ated on its surface. This flow includes jets, sheets, crowns and capillary waves. In many cases the sheets are unstable and break up into secondary drops. Any study of these fl uid fl ows becomes even more dif cult when spray strikes a very hot sur- face. For example, what happens when fuel is sprayed onto a piston in an internal combustion engine? If the piston's surface temperature reaches a certain value higher than the boiling point of the liquid called the Leidenfrost point, the liquid doesn't actually touch the surface. In- stead, it evaporates beforehand, creating a thin vapour layer or wall between the piston and the liquid. This process leads to the explosive break up of the liquid and the creation of secondary drops ( see Figure 2 ), a phenomenon quite com- mon when cooking. If water is sprinkled onto a skillet whose temperature is high enough, the water breaks up into droplets that skitter across the pan's surface. The thickness of the vapour wall created by spray impact is roughly 100 micrometers, and the typical duration of the event is about 10 mi- croseconds, all of which makes the experimen- tal examination of such fl ows rather demand- ing. However, in a microgravity environment these length and time scales can be expanded without altering the underlying physics. This permits the investigation of gravity's effect on numerous outcomes including spray impact, the wall- lm thickness, the dynamics of the splash and the heat transfer associated with the spray impact. A single drop hitting a wall creates a relative- ly fast, radially expanding fl ow, which interacts with the stationary liquid lm around the point of impact\u2014think of raindrops hitting a puddle. Upon impact, liquid in the puddle rises in a sheet surrounding the drop's entrance, forming what looks like a raised crater. The motion around its edges is governed by the surface tension of the liquid. A liquid rim forms on top of this raised crater, almost like the lip of a cup. In fact the ve- locity of the rising liquid sheet is faster than that of the rim on its upper edge; the rim continues to grow with the fl ow of liquid entering the rim from the sheet. If the rim lasts long enough be-fore it collapses back onto the surface, then it be- comes unstable and forms nger-like jets around its perimeter. When these become unstable, they pinch off into droplets. This is the physics be- hind what you see when pouring a glass of milk, and that last drop hits the liquid surface with a ABOUT THE AUTHORS Michael Dreyer received his doc- torate in engineering in 1993 at the Centre for Applied Space Technolo- gy and Microgravity at the Univer- sity of Bremen and has led their multiphase fl ow group since then.

Those droplets pinched off the crown's points are the secondary spray we know as splashing. Now multiple drops hitting a puddle, as in a rainstorm, can complicate this ideal picture. In- dividual drop impacts may appear as described above, but if the drops land close to one anoth- er or in quick succession, then the symmetry of the interaction is broken and a liquid sheet may rise up between the two points of impact. In any case, these liquid sheets are less stable and may collapse earlier, often breaking up into jets and later secondary drops\u2014or a lot of splashing. Under microgravity conditions, the lifetime of the uprising liquid sheets may be much lon- ger because gravity no longer pulls them down into the lm's surface. In such cases, the entire liquid rim may detach from the surface lm and be suspended before it eventually breaks up into individual drops around its circumfer- ence. So, although there are an in nite number of scenarios of splash when a spray impacts a wall, they are composed of a few number of basic interactions that can be well described and predicted. All this seems pretty esoteric, but inertia- driven fl ows have applications on Earth ranging from microelectronics to aircraft jet engines. By A single drop hitting a wall creates a relatively fast, radially expanding fl ow, which interacts with the stationary liquid lm around the point of impact\u2014think of raindrops hitting a puddle. studying these fl ows in a microgravity environ- ment, it will be possible to glean a greater un- derstanding of the fundamental physics behind spray-fl ow patterns and droplet depositions on a surface. Bridges over Troubled Waters In an experiment conducted on the ISS in 2003, a thick lm of pure water was produced by sim- ply immersing a wire loop several centimetres in diameter into a beaker of water. This liquid lm turned out to be remarkably resistant to surface deformations. It seemed like a straight- forward discovery, but then something unex- pected occurred. Injecting tiny fl akes of mica into the pure wa- ter allows any hidden fl ows and swirls to be- come visible. The ISS astronaut conducting the experiment observed that all motion within the lm appeared to cease a few minutes after the experiment began. So he turned on a fl ashlight to have a better look. Suddenly the fl uid started to move again\u2014almost as if someone was stir- ring it with an invisible spoon. The explanation for this surprising effect, known as thermocapillary fl ow, is not compli- cated. The focused beam of the fl ashlight heats the water lm, thereby slightly lowering the sur- FIGURE 2. TOO HOT TO HANDLE The black-and-white series shows a drop impact onto a hot surface. The impact leads to a splash and the creation of a thin evap orating liquid lm. When the surface temperature is high enough, a thin vapour layer forms between the surface and the liquid, which causes the dro ps to accelerate across the surface. The color series shows how grooves on a surface can increase the effectiveness of spray cooling. Here, an i nfrared camera captures a single drop as it hits a moist, grooved and heated surface in microgravity. The drop is colder than the liquid lm it creates on impact, and the cold water from the impacted drop collects in the grooves. The liquid lm is ruptured at the point where it meets the grooves due to the drop impact. 66 LOOKING UP: Europe's Quiet Revolution in Microgravity Research ZARMface tension on the spot where the light shines. The resulting imbalance of surface tension drives a fl ow from the hot to the cold area and back again, resulting in the appearance of a \"stirring\" motion. Similar fl ows can also arise from variations in chemical concentrations or the presence of an electric eld but experimen- tally, it is more revealing to generate a tempera- ture variation. This ISS experiment could not have been done on Earth as the lm would have immediately drained and collapsed. Under grav-ity only thin water lms are possible, and they have to be stabilized by adding soap. A good test for the systematic investigation of this thermocapillary fl ow involves the cre- ation of a liquid bridge between the end walls of two cylindrical rods. Setting the rods at differ- ent temperatures leads to a temperature varia- tion in the liquid, which results in a difference in surface tension along the outer surface of the liquid cylinder. When the temperature difference is small, a steady vortex ring is established in which the ro- tating fl uid takes on a toroid or doughnut shape. This ring consists of surface fl ow moving from the hot to the cold side of the outer surface and a return fl ow in the interior of the liquid bridge. Increasing the temperature difference above a certain threshold gives rise to fl ow patterns that vary with time. Adding tracer particles to the liquid reveals the fl ow. Understanding liquid bridges has a very practical application in the electronics industry because at the heart of all electronics is a pure, single silicon crystal. It is produced by some- thing called a fl oating-zone crystal-growth pro- cess. The purity of the crystal depends on the quality of the fl ow of melted silicon, and liquid- bridge science is the model for understanding how this all works. The Hidden Organisation In Earth's gravitational eld, water fl ows down- hill, masking deeper dimensions inherent in the fl uid itself. In a gravity-free environment, what we see is the hidden organisation of fluid dynamics that is a basic part of fundamental physics. For example, under certain conditions in a liquid-bridge experiment, tracer particles ac- cumulate and form a three-dimensional spiral string. Viewing it through the transparent top (c) Top view of the fl uid-fl ow pattern on the free sur- face of an open circular container heated from below and cooled from above. In this case, the fl ow pattern resembles that seen in biological cells. The experi-ment was conducted in microgravity during the fl ight of MAXUS-2 sounding rocket. Particle accumulation seen in a liquid bridge ex-periment. The top view (a) shows particles form-ing a three-blade \"windmill.\" That this windmill rotates is an illusion. The particles follow the fl ow, which is shaped like a doughnut, and the entire 3-D pattern rotates. The side view (b) illustrates the 3-D structure of the spiral particle string.FIGURE 3.

But the rotation is an illusion because the par- ticles follow the fl ow, which is essentially toroi- dal. In fact it is the three-dimensional pattern that rotates, not the liquid, and the individual particles organize themselves into what ap- pears to be a rotating wave ( see Figure 3a ). This separation from an initially homogeneous dis- tribution of particles can be traced back to par-ticle-free surface collisions, but as yet it is not fully understood. Another interesting example of fl uid fl ow self-organization appeared in the following simple experiment. A liquid is poured into an open container that is heated from below and cooled from above. Since the temperature var- ies perpendicular to the free surface, no sur- face-tension variation is initially present. How- ever, if the temperature difference across the layer rises above a critical threshold, the onset of patterns that resemble biological cells can be observed ( see Figure 3c ). This is known as Ma- rangoni instability and is triggered by the ap- pearance of weak hot spots on the surface. A similar process can be detected at the surface of rapidly evaporating metallic paint, though in this case the cooling (and resulting tempera- ture difference) is caused by evaporation. Tears of Wine Under terrestrial conditions, the thermocapil- lary effect described is usually masked by buoy- ant convection caused by the thermal expansion of the liquid. Both effects are connected because both are caused by temperature variations. In order to properly analyse the effect, it is essen- tial to decouple the complex fl ow driven by the two forces (buoyancy and thermocapillary) and isolate the effect of each. Experiments in microgravity offer the op- portunity to learn more about thermocapillary effects, free from the infl uence of buoyancy. Purely buoyant fl ows, on the other hand, can be studied on Earth in closed containers where there is no liquid/gas interface. Experiments performed in both environments will make it possible to understand the processes of com- bined buoyant-thermocapillary fl ow. Buoyancy forces are proportional to the vol- ume of the liquid, while thermocapillary forces act solely on the liquid's surface. If the system involved is very small, the importance of buoy- ancy diminishes. As a result, it is possible to ob-serve small-scale thermocapillary effects on Earth. For example, this is why the oil in a hot frying pan always moves toward the cold rim and why a thin layer of wine can climb the side of a wine glass, accumulate at a certain height, form droplets, and subsequently flow back down the glass as \"tears of wine.\" Thermocapillary fl ows also arise in an as- sortment of important space applications. As an example, heat pipes are important for cool- ing electronic devices in microgravity. At the hot end of the pipe, liquid evaporates and turns to vapour. The vapour then fl ows to the cold end of the pipe, where it condenses. The re- plenishment of liquid at the hot end is accom-plished by the thermocapillary effect, which drives the condensed liquid towards the hot side of the pipe. Another example is boiling liquids in weight- less conditions. Intense thermocapillary fl ow arises near the point of contact where the hot solid wall, the cold liquid, and the evaporated gas meet. The powerful fl ow induced by the lo- cal surface-tension variation contributes signif- icantly to heat fl ow. Complex but Essential Fluid physics is complicated but essential in our everyday lives. And as the 2008 incident at Heathrow Airport showed, it is of more than passing academic interest. Our knowledge of this science is generally good but incomplete. As the technology derived from fl uid fl ows\u2014high- pressure fuel pumps, silicon chip manufactur- ing, and server cooling systems\u2014becomes more exacting, filling the gaps in our knowledge becomes more important. While microgravity experiments provide in- dispensable details and proof of the phenomena, it is essential that they be accompanied by theo- retical analyses, numerical simulations, and ground-based testing. Together, all these efforts permit a direct experimental comparison, which helps us understand the many processes in- volved in choking, capillary forces, thermocap- illary fl fl 68 LOOKING UP: Europe's Quiet Revolution in Microgravity Research Breaking the Mould: Metallurgy in Microgravity www.spacefl ight.esa.int 69AT A GLANCE To produce increasingly complex metal products, the physics behind casting processes must be better understood.

Not quite, but the next giant step in metal processing technology may come from an unexpected source: the ISS . By Hans J. Fecht and Bernard Billia We often think of breakthroughs such as arti cial hips and knees and even dentures as modern day inventions. But these and millions of everyday products would not exist were it not for a pro- cess dating to the 1st millennium BC: casting. The processing of metallic alloys (a combination of two or more elemental metals) through melt- ing and casting techniques, whereby the molten material is poured or forced into a mould and allowed to harden, was invented several thou- sand years ago. Today, this processing is still an important step in the industrial production chain for a wide range of products from the very simple to the highly complex: turbine blades for jet engines, low-emission engines for cars, so- called supermetals used to produce wafer-thin sheets for electronic components, high-perfor- mance magnets and ne metallic powders to catalyze chemical reactions, to name just a few. Clearly, while the metallurgy done today owes a debt to history, the process itself has un- dergone much\u2014ahem\u2014re ning. The end prod- ucts often need to perform well and retain their integrity under extreme circumstances, partic- ularly when used at high temperatures or when the product must be as light as possible in order to conserve energy. To produce these high-per- formance materials, the process must be closely controlled for the sake of both optimal design and ef ciency of production.MATTER MATTERSSPACE CHANNEL / PHIL SAUNDERS 70 LOOKING UP: Europe's Quiet Revolution in Microgravity Research R.

The idea of casting metal in space probably seems at best outlandish and at worst unneces- sary. Why should microgravity be an important research tool when previous success has been achieved using ground-based, gravity-condi- tioned methods? To nd that answer we need to look further into the melting and casting process. Metal Works As previously stated, casting is a process by which a molten metal is solidi ed. The liquid- to-solid transition is driven by the properties of hot liquid metal and the way in which it cools over time, in the same way that water freezes to ice at 0\u00b0C. From the standpoint of physics, castings belong to systems in which, rather than changing evenly in space and smoothly in time, the solid phase normally forms unevenly and with diverse microstruc- tures ( see Figure 1 ). Sophisticated computer models have been de- veloped within the past 10 years that allow the formation of such microstructures to be analysed in great detail. For example, Figure 1b shows the evolution of the tree-like structures called den- drites (blue), which crystallise before the still-liq- uid portion solidi es (green red; see also \"Dendrite Formation,\" right). This interac- tion between experiments and computer simula-tion has led to improved designs as well as im- proved performance undreamed of in the past. The fact that the transition from liquid to solid state is not a uniform process holds true whether one views the finished piece at the smallest increment (nanometre) or on the larg- est scale. In addition, the rate at which a cast- ing cools affects its microstructure, quality and properties. Generally, the areas that cool quick- ly have a ne grain structure while the areas that cool slowly have a coarse grain structure. Figure 2 illustrates the temperature distribution within a car's engine block immediately after the casting process was nished. Here we see that the temperature varies considerably be-tween different locations within this large piece of metal since cooling occurs at a much higher rate close to the interface with the mould. It fol- lows that for high-precision castings, the mas- tering of the grain structure during the liquid-to-solid phase transition is paramount for qual-ity control as well as the engineering, tailoring, and design of advanced materials for speci c technological applications. Cast in a Different Mould It seems an amazing contradiction that despite the array of complex products currently manu- factured, much of the basic physics behind these processes remains poorly understood. Clearly, the demands of industry call for the continued improvement of materials processing in the areas of composition, microstructure and per- formance by: Determining the thermophysical and relat- ed properties of metallic melts Mapping out basic relationships between alloy and mould at the microstructure level Developing predictive modelling of the for- mation of grain structures during solidi cation. Dendrite Formation Named after the Greek word \"dendron\" for tree, the term dendrite applies to a wide variety of structures with tree-like branches such as neurons, which are composed of a cell body and dendrites that extend from that body. Snowfl akes, which exhibit an in nite number of elegantly shaped branches with hexagonal sym-metry, are the most familiar example of dendrites. After water vapour forms and so-lidi es on a tiny dust particle (nucleation), the arms of the snowfl ake branch out di-rectly from the newly formed ice crystal. Their complex shape continues to evolve as a result of in nite variations in condi- tions such as temperature, humidity and chemicals encountered by each ice crystal as it falls through the atmosphere. Most snowfl akes begin as relatively fl at, hexagonal shapes. The level of complexity of the dendritic arms results from the instability of these smooth shapes and their reaction to the changing environment. In images (a) and (b) below, the six dendritic branches are basically identical to one another, which indicates that the growth conditions were similar around the growing crystal. If the arms were asymmetrical, how-ever, this would indicate that the conditions surrounding one branch were slightly different from those of its neigh-bour. For comparison, image (c) shows snowfl ake-like grains growing in a melt. AB C 1 mm72 LOOKING UP: Europe's Quiet Revolution in Microgravity ResearchAccomplishing these tasks requires bench- mark data, and experiments performed in micro- gravity enable the study of the above properties free of certain restrictions of a gravity-based en- vironment. In space it is possible to suppress gravity's effects on the fl ow of molten metals and on sedimentation during solidi cation. Without gravity's interference, it is possible to isolate oth- er properties for investigation, such as diffusion and how it contributes to mass and heat trans- port in the melt without the gravity-associated complications of certain solute ingredients being more buoyant than others. Under normal cir- cumstances, the transfer of heat is modi ed by convection in the melt, a process that makes por- tions of the melt \"fl oat\" or \"settle.\" Solid grains most often settle under the opposing forces of weight and buoyancy, which is called sedimenta- tion. Obtaining evidence of this behaviour through real-time x-ray studies on the ISS is one of the primary goals of experimentation. The resulting insights into alloy solidi cation and processing to be gained can potentially be used to produce new and unique microstructures. In addition, the space environment allows levi- tated melts (see \"Electromagnetic Levitator\" on opposite page) to be controlled effectively at tem- peratures up to 2000\u00baC. This control enables the critical parameters of the liquid to be measured much more accurately than in an Earth-bound laboratory. Monitoring these experiments with sophisticated computer equipment has lead to improved validation of predictive models of this process\u2014information that was much needed. Research by Levitation So the idea of taking a process thousands of years old and experimenting on it in space under weightless conditions is not so crazy after all. However, it is still necessary to consider what research can and should be carried out. ESA's research programme focuses on a number of areas, including alloy solidi cation when there are multiple phases and components, such as the multicomponent alloys used in many prod- ucts, including the non-iron alloys used in jet engines and the growth of semiconductors such as silicon for solar-powered cells. In order to perform the necessary experi- ments, it is important to have access to extend- ed periods of reduced gravity. Microgravity experiments in materials research conducted by ESA are to be carried out in a number of multi-user facilities onboard the ISS, as well as on other microgravity platforms, such as para- bolic flights and sounding rockets. One ISS facility important to the eld of materials re- search is the Materials Science Laboratory (MSL). The MSL's furnace inserts allow highly specialized solidi cation experiments to be per- formed under microgravity conditions, with and without the application of fl ow-inducing magnetic elds. Another crucial ISS facility is the Electro- magnetic Levitator (EML). As fantastic as it sounds, this equipment does precisely what the name implies: levitates molten metals. The EML permits containerless melting and solidi cation of alloys and semiconductor samples. Further- more, the EML is equipped with highly ad- vanced diagnostic tools that permit accurate measurements of thermophysical properties, as well as direct observation of the experiment during fl ight by high-speed videography. Using such advanced techniques to gather data on the intricate processes of melting and casting brings us closer to the design of new ma- terials with better performance. Such advanced products can range from metre-sized objects to micrometer-sized powders, for example: energy ef cient engines for the car industry metallic foams medical implants JET SET Aluminum-based alloys are ideal for the blades in jet engine tur-bines because of their strength, reduced weight and resistance to damage from stress.

Intermetallics: Not a Space-Age Rock Group A new international European Commission- Integrated Project (with ESA) has been estab- lished in the eld of intermetallic alloy solidi - cation. Christened IMPRESS\u2014Intermetallic Materials Processing in Relation to Earth and Space Solidi cation\u2014this project represents an important step toward promoting scienti c rec- iprocity between ground-based and micrograv- ity experiments. The project comprises about 40 industrial and academic research groups from 15 European countries and will increase our understanding of the critical link between materials processing, structure, and nal prop- erties of new intermetallic alloys, and NiAl (nickel alu- minide). For additional see the IMPRESS website at http://www.space- fl ight.esa.int/impress/. Called \"aluminide intermetallics,\" these alu- minium-based alloys have a de nite proportion of two or more elemental metals and have many attractive mechanical, physical and chemical properties due to their crystal structures and strong chemical bonds. For example, Ti-alu- minides are well suited for blades in high perfor-mance aircraft engine turbines because of their reduced weight, improved mechanical strength and resistance to damage from stress whereas powders of Ni-aluminides have excellent cata- lytic activity for fuel cell applications. In both cases the use of these advanced materials im- proves the system performance tremendously. Melting Away the Barriers As the products we make become more sophis- ticated, it follows that their production process- es must keep up. Advancements in liquid pro- cessing techniques have enabled industry to cre- ate products such as jet engines, medical It sounds like an oxymoron if ever there was one, but for more than twenty years, space agencies have been developing levitators that both lift - and heat - metal samples us- ing electromagnetic forces, acoustic waves or electrostatic forces. In these levitators, high-frequency alternating or static magnetic elds are generated by passing a current through an assembly of coils shaped for positioning and heating. This electromagnetic eld induces corresponding currents in the metal sample placed between the coils that heats (and sometimes melts) the sample. The machine can then use the combined cur-rents and electromagnetic eld to generate a force that lifts the sample. Other than Houdini, who would want to levitate metal? The answer is quite possibly anyone involved in processing. Levitation of molten metals and other materials was de-veloped to avoid contact with container walls, which can lead to contamination of the sample and undesirable non-uniform crystallisation. When microgravity is applied, con-tainerless levitation processing becomes better and more ef cient. In the absence of gravity, separation and sedimentation within the metal are eliminated, uniform mixing is achieved, and samples can be processed that are much larger than those on Earth. Electromagnetic Levitator (EML), jointly developed by ESA and the German Space Agency, the DLR, permits the accurate property measurements of highly reactive liquid metal alloys. implants and spacecraft, but society's push for continually stronger, lighter and more ef cient products requires that next great leap. The most recent developments in technolo- gies have been seen in liquid processing, which has the potential to improve the facilities respon- sible for the casting of complex parts and pro- duction of powders for the catalytic activation of chemical reactions. T o make this process more reliable, sophisticated computer models have been recently introduced in which all as- pects of industrial liquid metals processing are standardized to ensure long-term sustainability. To keep moving forward, ESA, together with the European national space agencies, has set up a scienti c programme using the unique, gravity- free environment on parabolic fl ights, sounding rockets and, in the near future, the ISS to devel- op new designs, structures and products. SPACE CHANNEL / PHIL SAUNDERSAT A GLANCE Vibrations can act like arti - cial gravity on inanimate matter. Behaviours of liquids and gases including heat trans-fer, condensation and evaporation must be con-trolled for ef cient use on spacecraft. Granular matter can act like a solid, liquid or gas and the role of vibration on its properties must be better understood. \u2014The EditorsMATTER MATTERS We have all seen television footage of astro- nauts fl oating around on Mir and the Inter- national Space Station. Freed from Earth's gravity, they move weightlessly in a slow-motion ballet, unrestricted by \"up\" or \"down.\" But what do we know of the effects of weightlessness on the behaviour of inan- imate matter such as liquids, gases and granular mat ter such as sand? On Earth we take for granted that liquids sit at the bottom of the bottle, gas mostly rises to the top and grains naturally stick together to form sand piles. When weightless, it is not possible to pour yourself a glass of Champagne\u2014the liquid won't drop to the bottom\u2014and even if you succeeded, the bubbles would just sit in the liquid and wouldn't rise to the top. Nor could you build a sand castle. The grains of sand have no attraction be tween them, called cohesion, to keep them together; and thus spread like gas molecules in the air.Shake, Rattle and Roll: Using Vibrations as Gravity In space, you can't toast your successes with Champagne or sweep sand into a pile to clean up. So how can you make matter behave?

Clear- ly human beings can direct their movements under these conditions, but are they left to swim through a sea of fl oating debris? More impor- tantly, how does the spacecraft itself function? Fortunately there are forces other than gravity at work. Although gas bubbles, liquid droplets and solid objects are no longer subject to the rules of gravity, they are, however, still bound by inertia\u2014that is they remain at rest until and unless some force exerts pressure on them. That force can be quite minimal\u2014in the form of vibrations. Even a weak vibration in space causes matter to feel the stress of that pressure and to respond with an equal reaction, such as a counter movement. As illustrated in the experi- ments discussed below, these reactions often mirror those like buoyancy that you would ex- pect on Earth where gravity is present. Thus, the vibration acts as an arti cial form of gravity. Fluids provide a good model for investigation when they are under the speci c conditions that ABOUT THE AUTHORS Daniel Beysens received his PhD at Universit\u00e9 Paris-6.

Thus, the boundary between the liquid and gas phases disappears. The two states mix together as a dense gas (a gas with the den- sity of a liquid) and are called \"supercritical fl u- ids.\" For carbon dioxide, the critical point oc- curs at a temperature of 31\u00b0C and pressure of 73 bar, which is 73 times the atmospheric pressure. For water, the critical point pressure is 220 bar and temperature is 374\u00b0C. When near their crit- ical point, all fl uids behave in a similar manner; so by studying one fl uid, the properties of all fl u- ids can be deduced, a phenomenon called \"crit-ical point universality.\" (Kenneth G. Wilson won the Nobel Prize in 1982 for providing the theoretical framework to estimate the universal features of critical point phenomena.) Supercritical fl uids possess other interesting properties, for instance supercritical carbon di- oxide is a very powerful solvent of organic mat- ter and it is not harmful to living things or the Left: Condensation of a fl uid on Earth.

The result is this strange-looking mixture where vapour bubbles can exist inside liquid droplets.Condensation vs. Diffusion SPACE CHANNEL / PHIL SAUNDERS www.spacefl ight.esa.int 77ESPCI / ECP / CNRSenvironment. It is also possible to burn danger- ous wastes, like ammunitions, in supercritical water ef ciently and safely. Fluids like oxygen and hydrogen are also used in space under super- critical conditions because they remain homoge- neous regardless of spacecraft's accelera- tions\u2014or absence gravity vector. Supercritical fl uids are very unstable and particularly sensitive to the effects of gravity or vibrations. This property and the fact they are universal models for fl uid behavior makes the observation of their behaviour extremely help- ful. Sand ts these criteria as well in that the grains can act like molecules of a liquid or gas depending on the situation. Being Hot is \"Cool\" As anyone who has ever made pasta knows, when a liquid in a saucepan is heated from below and before the liquid boils or the pasta is added, the layer closest to the heat becomes lighter than its environment and rises. As it cools down at the top, it sinks down and a rapid ordered motion develops creating a circulatory pattern of rolls within the liquid, thus transferring the heat throughout, which is called convection. This behaviour can also be seen with gases, in which, for instance, cyclic clouds are quite often observed. Since microgravity removes any semblance of up and down, you would expect to see an al- together different pattern of motion when a liq- uid is heated in space. However, we can repro- duce the convection pattern using vibrations as arti cial gravity. When a container and its con- tents are heated and then vibrated, the pattern of motion resembles that seen here on Earth. This motion is detailed in Figure 1. Sometimes when a substance reacts to vibrations in a weightless environment, the fl ow pattern ap- pears to defy common sense, such as when the motion occurs perpendicular\u2014instead of par-allel\u2014to the vibration, but this reaction can be explained by the fact that other forces are trig- gered by the vibration force. The Converts: Condensation and Evaporation We've all\u2014quite innocently, of course\u2014fogged up the car windows at some point. Under these normal conditions on Earth, when a fl uid starts to condense, tiny liquid droplets form and these tiny droplets fuse and run together to form larg- er ones. Because liquid is the heavier substance, gravity causes it to pool together under the vapour, and the boundary between the liquid and gas phases is fl at (see Figure 2a ). Under weightless conditions, however, bub- bles or droplets can only grow by the haphazard and slower process of collision, known as diffu- sion. What we are left with is a strange-looking mixture: in the liquid there are a few large va- pour bubbles that coexist with many tiny va-pour bubbles. In addition, the appearance of the mixture varies according to the vapour volume. When the vapour volume is greater than 30% of the fl uid, the bubbles are so close together that it forms an interconnected pattern ( see Figure 2c). When the vapour volume is less than 30% of the fl uid, we see that the boundary between liquid and vapour is spherical ( see Figure 2b ), unlike the fl at surface seen on Earth. In one experiment, we initiated the evapora- tion of a liquid under low amplitude, high fre- quency vibrations (200 \u00b5m, 20 Hz). Under these conditions, the vapour bubbles progressively align and stretch and fuse together. Then, rath- er surprisingly, stripes of gas form in space in a way that remind you of the fl at interface be- tween vapour and liquid which we see on Earth (see Figure 2d-i). Due to the lack of experimental time in space, the stripes shown in Figure 2 are not the ulti- mate equilibrium state, which we expect to be a unique vapour stripe in the middle of the cell as FIGURE 1.

Sand is a model for other granular matter. Its study in the weightless conditions of space rais- es numerous technical issues, such as the best way to work with grains and powders in satel- lites and spacecraft. (Indeed, when travelling for 20 years we will need to grow plants, to cut them in pieces, to harvest corns and seeds, to grind or sow them to get food, and so on.) Such studies may also answer very fundamental questions concerning the formation of asteroids and the history of the Earth's formation. At the same time we need to ask: \"Should we consider gran- ular matter as a gas or a liquid or a solid, since on Earth sand can fl ow like liquid and form sand piles like a solid and, in weightless condi- tions, can fl oat and spread around like a gas?\" In this context, grains act like fl uid molecules. Will they also exhibit properties of various states of matter: gas, liquid and solid? However, in order to be considered as either a fl uid or a solid, sand must exhibit a \"temper- ature.\" What does \"temperature\" look like? In a fl uid, temperature is achieved by the random motion of molecules: the higher their velocity, the higher the temperature. Thus, in terms of sand, the grains would acquire a temperature by reaching a random velocity, and that mo- tion would generate energy known as kinetic energy. One way to create motion is by vibrat- ing the walls of the sand container. so that the grains near the wall will collide, and then con- tinue to collide with other grains. In this way grains behave like the balls struck on a snook- er table. Unfortunately, during the series of collisions, some energy is lost or dissipated, which is why vibrated granular matter is often called \"dissi- pative matter.\" Scientists are using weightless- ness to address the different forms of energy found in this strange \"dissipative\" matter and to determine its characteristics. These studies are still in their infancy. However, in experi- ments carried out on Earth, it turns out that the main physical parameter that determines sand's behaviour is the number of layers of grain in the experiment container. This nding makes the properties of granular matter very abnormal, as these properties change when the volume of matter is changed. Temperature is one example of such a property. As stated above, tempera- ture is determined by the velocity of the grains, (a) Separation of liquid and gas under Earth's gravity. The demarcation line between phases is labelled I. (b) Under weightless conditions, with a small (<30%) vapour volume. Bubbles can only coalesce through collisions.

Note the difference in how phases separate in microgravity in (a) and (b) without vibration versus (d-i) with vibration. When vibrations are applied, the liquid-gas interface looks more like what is seen on Earth, with a fl at line between phases. On Earth Under weightlessness TimeUnder vibrationB D E FIHGCAFIGURE 2.

Because a small amount of velocity is lost by dissipation, the grains in the center of the container will have a velocity lower than the grains near the vibrating wall. Thus, granular matter consisting of many grains will be cooler at its centre in con- trast to matter consisting of only a few grains that exhibit nearly the same velocity. In-Grained Behaviour To illustrate this phenomenon, we rst apply vibrations to only one grain in a rectangular box. On Earth\u2014where the properties such as gravity and friction apply\u2014our one grain can only col- lide with one wall. In space, however, not only does the one grain bounce between two walls, it also rebounds in a perfectly perpendicular straight line. This obviously does not happen on Earth where the grain does not reach the second wall but moves along by \"jumping.\" The center image in Figure 3 is an illustration of two coherent grains moving at the same speed in a vibrated experiment container under weight- less conditions. The reason that the grain bounc- es from wall to wall in a straight line is because it does not rotate. Think again of the snooker ta- ble. A player can strike the cue ball off-centre to impart \"spin\" and affect the movement of the ball using the rotation of that spin. But in this ex- periment, there is no spin. The reason the grain does not rotate or \"spin\" is related to the shape of the container (a cube or a cylinder, chosen for sake of simplicity) and to the friction that results when a particle with an inclined trajectory rebounds with some rota- tion on one surface and with the counter-rota-tion on a second surface. As energy dissipates in the collision, the grain speed after the rebound is less than before, a decrease that eventually \"freezes\" the grain rotation. What is also re- markable is that the grain moves at a much fast- er speed than the vibrations of the wall\u2014a par- adox when one considers the energy lost during each collision with the walls. Multi-Grain If one performs the experiment with two grains of the same size, both particles move at the same speed. Can this coherent motion be applied to more grains in such a way that they form a The behaviour of granular matter in space will be understood when the nature of temperature (velocity) and the role of vibration are better understood. The behaviour of sand grains subjected to vibrations, indicated by the double red arrow. Left: On Earth, the vibration is too weak for the grain to overcome gravity and reach the second wall. Thus it moves forward by \"jumping.\" Centre: Under weightless conditions two coherent grains move at the same speed in the vibrated container. Both particles collide only with the walls and make one round-trip per vibration period. Right: With many grains in the container, t he grains collide with the walls and with each other. Higher grain density in the middle of the cell means that they cannot move a s fast there, which also means the temperature is cooler there than along the sides where they move more freely. FIGURE 3. On the Rebound80 LOOKING UP: Europe's Quiet Revolution in Microgravity Research NASA; CNES / CADMOS\"grain laser\" in which a continuous stream of sand grains is emitted like photons of light beaming from within a laser? Unfortunately, when we increase the number of grains, they start interacting strongly, colliding and repel- ling each other as they cannot occupy the same place at the same time. The motion looses its coherence and becomes erratic. With many grains in an experiment contain- er, the trajectories of those grains are then com- plicated by collisions ( see Figure 3 ). If the grain concentration remains relatively small, the grains uniformly occupy most of the available space (the container length minus the zone where the wall vibrates). If we increase the con- centration of the grains past a certain point, they generate a cloud of gas.However, the system is not completely ran- dom. The grains do follow certain behaviour patterns endemic to a liquid or gas. As discussed previously, the grains acquire temperature through movement, which creates kinetic ener- gy. The distribution of speeds within the exper- iment container can vary considerably, and even the thickness of the container can make a differ- ence. Grains no longer have the same velocity (or temperature) everywhere. Slower speeds in the middle of the container mean cooler temper- atures while faster speeds along the top and bot- tom lead to hotter temperatures. Behaviour Matters Obviously, scientists' chief concern in studying these behaviours is not to make it possible to build sand castles\u2014or drink Champagne. Liq- uids and gases are essential to the functioning of spacecraft and to life support systems, but the weightless conditions in space make it quite dif- cult to use them ef ciently. We have found that vibrations can play the role of arti cial gravity for a number of key phenomena speci c to the behaviour of liquids and gases, such as thermal convection, evaporation and condensation. Hot and cold fluid, bubbles and droplets find a respective \"up\" and \"down\" when the vibration is turned on, thus simulating a reaction like that seen under normal gravitational conditions. As a matter of fact, physicians are already using vibration as arti cial gravity to prevent muscle decay or bone decalci cation in space. Granular matter (sand), although often con- sidered regular solid matter, exhibits unique be- haviours and properties, some of which are still unknown. As we have seen, the individual grains act similarly to the molecules of a liquid or gas. As such, vibration gives them a velocity and a \"temperature.\" The behaviour of granu- lar matter in space will be understood when the nature of this temperature and the role of vibra- tion are better understood. Once the right con- ditions are determined and then applied, we could theoretically affect the behaviour of grains so that they cohere as a solid, fl ow as a liquid, or expand as a gas depending on their in- tended use. It is both a fundamental problem that is related to the origin of the universe and the formation of dust, asteroids and planets and, more practically, it is quite essential for astro- nauts as it relates to the everyday necessities of growing food, managing waste and, in a word, surviving during long-duration journey through the universe.

Since then, research into its properties and behaviours has exploded, and experiments on the ISS have led to a number of discoveries that could not have been made in the presence of gravity. By Gregor Mor ll and Hubertus Thomas The Complex Matter of Plasma Rarely is a scientist able to announce the discovery of a major new state of matter; in particular a state that common sense suggests should not exist. But this is precisely what happened at the International Conference on Phenomena in Ionised Gases in September 1993 in Bochum, Germany. A Different State of Matter Matter exists in four states: solid, liquid, gas- eous, and plasma. It might be argued that plas- ma is nothing more than the ionized or charged state of gas. However, since the physics of interactions within plasma and gas is very dif- ferent, the consensus is that plasma should be regarded as the fourth state of matter. This simple picture corresponds to the old elements of Earth, Water, Air, and Fire, but it is not the whole story. In the late 20th century, the Nobel laureate Pierre-Gilles de Gennes coined the term \"soft matter\" for a class of large (centimetre-sized) assemblies of substances that appear \"soft\" and consist of various supramolecular or \"large\" entities (large by atomic or molecular stand- ards). He de ned soft matter as \"supramolecu- lar substances, which exhibit special properties such as softness or elasticity, which have an in- ternal equilibrium structure that is sensitive to external forces, which may possess excited metastable states, and where the relevant phys- ics occurs far above the quantum limit.\" MATTER MATTERS 82 LOOKING UP: Europe's Quiet Revolution in Microgravity Research www.spacefl ight.esa.int 83 AT A GLANCE Traditionally, matter exists as a solid, liquid, gas or plasma, but complex plasmas or soft matter can be created by adding large or su-pramolecular particles to ordinary plasma. Studying soft plasma matter on Earth is dif cult because it must be levitated to be viewed, and gravity pulls it downward. Experiments in space have resulted in super-coagulation in a neutral gas, which formed one giant conglomerate and a range of smaller ones. Complex plasma research can be applied to many areas: waste removal, pollution control, solar cells, semiconductor chips and medicine. \u2014The Editors SPACE CHANNEL / PHIL SAUNDERS84 LOOKING UP: Europe's Quiet Revolution in Microgravity Research MAX-PLANCK-INSTITUTSoft matter comes in two different states. Granular solids, polymers (compounds made up of large molecules) and foams represent the sol- id state, while emulsions and colloids (mixtures containing particles of one compound suspend- ed in another, milk is one example) represent liquids. The 1993 announcement in Bochum that supramolecular or complex plasmas could be made to assume crystalline structures caused quite a stir. Sir John Maddox, the editor of Na- ture at the time, refl ected the opinion of the day when he stated: \"That physicists are the masters of arti ce in the experiments they design is widely recognised, but sometimes their tricks quite take the breath away. Most of what follows is about an experiment of outstand- ing ingenuity, which, despite the electronic equipment no doubt accompanying it, is also simple. The word 'elegant' is over- worked, but in this case it applies...\" Maddox concluded his discussion of soft matter by stating: \"What the authors them- selves would like to do is to carry out their ex- periment in microgravity conditions. On the face of things, it is a more deserving candidate for room in some future Space Shuttle fl ight than most of the others so far suggested.\" Complex Plasmas Plasma is everywhere, though it often goes unrecognized. The mammoth strike of a light- ning bolt and the tiny sparks of static electricity are both examples of plasma. The Sun is a huge ABOUT THE AUTHORS Both Gregor Mor ll and Hubertus Thomas are currently at the Max Planck Institute for Extra-terrestrial Physics in Germany.ball of plasma; in fact plasma is quite common in space. On Earth, plasma has multiple uses in many industrial applications from lights to plasma televisions. Ordinary plasma is a collec- tion of particles: positively charged ions (elec-trically charged atoms) and negatively charged electrons. The system's charge is neutral; in oth-er words, there are as many positive as negative charges. The particles interact via their electric forces instead of through atomic or molecular interactions, as is the case in neutral gases. The discharge that produces light in mercury- or sodium-vapour streetlamps is an example of ordinary plasma in action. Complex plasma has an additional compo- nent\u2014charged supramolecular microparticles (see Figure 1 ). Although these microparticles can be as small as one ten-millionth of a metre, they are extremely heavy\u2014many billions of times heavier than atoms\u2014and still carry a charge. In fact if their number is suf ciently large, they be- come the dominant component and as such will determine the structure of the system. This can happen in an interstellar gas cloud when the ad- dition of dust to the ordinary plasma present in the cloud turns it into complex plasma. Because supramolecular microparticles have signi cant mass, changes in their state or mo- tion are slowed by a factor of between one hun- dred thousand and one million, which means that individual particles can be seen. Hence the physical processes taking place can be viewed in super-slow motion and at the individual par- ticle level. It's an experimenter's dream or, per- haps, a theoretician's nightmare. Being able to observe individual microparti- cles and their super-slow motion may be ideal for experimental studies of the strong and weak coupling phenomena (the interaction between particles) in multi-particle physics. This, in turn, could lead to a better understanding of the fun- damental principles that govern the stability and self-organisation of condensed matter and of critical phenomena such as phase transitions (regular changes in state), as well as the explo- FIGURE 1.

To perform these observations on Earth, a device containing an upper and lower electrode creates an electrostatic force that levitates the microparticles and neutralizes gravity ( see Fig- ure 2 ). But Earth's gravity is so strong that the electrostatic force can create only a thin, hori- zontal layer of free-fl oating microparticles. As a result, Earth-bound experiments have natu- rally concentrated on fl at or monolayer systems (a single continuous layer that is only one micro- particle, molecule, or atom thick). Still, these are of great interest in many areas including the study of surface physics, membranes and the stability principles of condensed matter. In the absence of gravity, however, the micro- particles can occupy the whole plasma, and it's possible to obtain experimental conditions when the system is isotropic (uniform), homogeneous and not stressed by the pull of gravity. For the precise measurements needed to study three-di- mensional systems and for stress-free processes, microgravity experiments are essential. Microparticles: Charging and Shielding Generally, a microparticle introduced into plas- ma will absorb electrons and ions and become charged. In low-temperature plasma, the charge on the microparticles is negative because elec- trons are much faster than ions, and conse- quently electron impacts occur more frequently than ion impacts. The negative charge on the microparticles repels the (negative) electrons and attracts the (positive) ions. This continues until, after a few microseconds, the collision rates are the same, and the microparticle has reached Q, its equilibrium charge (typically a few thousand electrons). Around the microparticle the free electrons and ions react to its electric eld and form a pos- itive-charge cloud. The extent of this \"shielding cloud\" (so named because it effectively screens or shields the local charge of the microparticle) FIGURE 2. PLASMA DISCHARGE DEVICE The most common device used in complex plasma experiments is a radio frequency (rf) discharge de-vice seen here. The plasma is usu-ally a noble gas (argon, neon) at a pressure of about 1 mbar. The plasma is \"ignited\" using a radio frequency signal on the two paral-lel electrodes. The microparticles are illuminated by a laser and viewed by recording the refl ected light with a CCD camera. Using a thin (100 \u00b5m) sheet of laser light allows the simultaneous recording of a whole lattice plane.

RAISE THE SHIELDS The shape of the plasma shielding cloud around a negatively charged microparticle in (a) a uniform plas-ma distribution and (b) fl owing plasma.Macro lens ParticlesSheet light Powered called its \"Debye length,\" named after the fa- mous Dutch physicist Peter Debye. In isotropic plasma, where the plasma's prop- erties do not vary with direction, the shielding cloud is spherical. If the plasma fl ows around the microparticle, the shielding cloud is elongated and anisotropic, with an excess positive charge downstream. This occurs in complex plasma ex- periments conducted on Earth ( see Figure 3 ). The force between the microparticles is elec- tric and, due to the shielding, has a limited range. If the particles are too far apart, they will be out of range and the system is said to be \"weakly interacting.\" In nature\u2014in star-form- ing gas clouds, zodiacal light (sunlight refl ected by a myriad of particles), planetary rings, light- ning and so on\u2014this is usually the case where complex or dusty plasmas exist. However, if the particles are close enough, then the motion of each directly infl uences the motion of its neighbour, and they become strong- ly interacting. This presupposes that other forc- es, such as particle interactions with any neutral gas that happens to be present, are not more im- portant. So for a description of strongly coupled complex plasmas, two parameters are needed: one describing the coupling strength and the other the particle separation. Human vs. Robot As suggested by Sir John Maddox, experiments on complex plasmas have been conducted in space, though in the two complex-plasma labo- ratories on the International Space Station rath- er than the Space Shuttle. From 2001 to 2005, the rst lab was the Russian-German Plasma Kristall Experiment (PKE-Nefedov, named for the Russian project scientist who died just before the lab was installed on the ISS). The improved next-generation laboratory, PK-3 Plus, was launched in 2005 and was built on the same prin- ciples as its predecessor but with a more advanced design, better manipulation capabilities and improved particle and plasma diagnostics. A brief snapshot of experimental results from research performed on the ISS is summarized in \"Experimental Results\" on the opposite page. While the decision to build the ISS was a po- litical one, its ability to host complex research is a practical consequence. The presence of astro- nauts is a bonus, especially for the type of exper- iments that cannot be fully tested on Earth. By designing the instruments so that astronauts can perform the experiments themselves\u2014exploring parameters that may be ideal in microgravity but impossible on Earth\u2014the risks that always plague purely robotic missions can be reduced. Such research, performed with dedicated, versa- tile, space-proven equipment\u2014little \"laborato- ries\" that can be recon gured and adapted to study unexpected results and discoveries\u2014can yield a great deal of new knowledge at compara- tively little extra cost. Astronaut operation of the experiments has proven immensely valuable and has resulted in about 50 scienti c publica- tions. Of those publications, two exemplify the bene t of a living, breathing and thinking hu- man experimenter over a robotic one. Supercoagulation The rst is the discovery of \"supercoagulation.\" Cosmonaut Yuri Baturin conducted a series of FIGURE 4. AMAZING DISCOVERY Examples of supercoagulation as observed on the ISS.

In the crystalline state, the micropar ticles occupy a well de ned, ordered lattice. In the liquid state, structural disorder and some-what higher particle mobility is seen. In the gaseous state, the particles move much faster, leav ing long tracks captured during a single exposure.

Response to external elds. These three images, ob- tained on the ISS, show the same liquid plasma under different external alternating current electric elds. The elds applied were (from left to right) 10, 12 and 19 volts. At the higher volt-ages the particles align along the eld\u2014a physical process simi-lar to electrorheology (electrically induced deformation and fl ow) in colloids, albeit at a much lower voltage and frequency.All these experiments were carried out at temperatures (typically room temperature) when the thermal energies were much higher than those of the quantum states themselves. These examples illustrate that the strong coupling possible in complex plasmas leads to only one conclusion\u2014the presence of the plasma state of soft matter. The fact that complex plasma can exist in solid, liquid and gaseous forms makes the complexi-ty of these systems even more apparent. Hence the hierarchy of system states shown below begins to resemble the classical states of matter (solid, liquid, gaseous, plasma) \u2014albeit with much more diversity.Crystalline Liquid Gaseous hcp fcc 1 mm88 LOOKING UP: Europe's Quiet Revolution in Microgravity Research ESA / CNESAdaptable Intelligence Although robots are useful, a thinking human researcher is essential. Pictured are some of the astronauts/cosmonauts who carried out experiments in the PK-Laboratories on the for which the methodology dif- fered from the way they had been designed and programmed. The original idea was to perform a plasma experiment, but the plasma was never activated. So as an alternative, microparticles were injected into neutral, argon gas. The result was unexpected: no plasma and no charge. Instead, within seconds the microparticles formed one very large conglomerate and a whole spectrum of smaller ones ( see Figure 4 ). This result had two surprising features. First, the large conglomerate contained some 100,000 microparticles, whereas the predicted coagula- tion was just two particles. Second, the size spectrum of the smaller conglomerates was a power law. In physics, this is usually an indica- tion that a special \"scale-free\" process is oper- ating, meaning that the size of the conglomerate is not dependent on the energy of the particles. It's unlikely such a discovery could have been made on Earth, because in a gravitational eld the particles would have simply fallen out of view in a fraction of a second. This discovery may have some interesting ap- pl ications\u2014in toxic waste removal, pollution control and industrial production processes. So understanding the origin of this behaviour is of considerable interest beyond the simple intellec- tual puzzle of why and how nature can create something 100,000 times faster than predicted. When a theory emerged based on the initial ex- periments, the versatility of the PKE-laboratory and the human researchers made possible a se- ries of subsequent experiments that con rmed the origin of this new physical process now called supercoagulation. Electrorheology Another example proving human superiority to robots involves \"electrorheology,\" an electrical- www.spacefl ight.esa.int 89MAX-PLANCK-INSTITUTly induced deformation and that is well known in colloid physics. Electrorheology is the process by which an external electric eld is applied across a colloid fl uid and causes major changes in the properties of the fl uid by rear- ranging the suspended particles\u2014in other words altering its structure, or rheology. Viscos- ity is modi ed, compressibility is changed and the shear modulus (the ratio of the shear stress to the shear strain) is altered. The fl uid may even assume solid structure. This happens because the electric eld induces a dipole in the (usually electro-active) colloidal particles. These induced dipole fields lead to a rearrangement and realignment of the particles, which in turn leads to changes in the fl uid's properties. The whole process works because the suspended particles are electro-active and the fl uid is neutral. Inter- estingly, this property of colloidal fl uids could be employed in everything from shock absorb- ers to the protection of buildings against earth- quake damage. The question arose as to whether complex plasmas might also have electrorheological properties. In other words, if \"electrorheologi- cal plasmas\" could be produced in a similar way as \"electrorheological fl uids.\" This seemed un- likely as the conditions between the two systems could not be more different. In colloidal or com- plex fl uids the background fl uid is neutral and the particles within are electrically active, while in complex plasmas the background ion-elec- tron plasma is highly conductive and the mi- croparticles are insulators. In complex fl uids the typical particle separation is approximately the particle size (in other words they are densely packed); in complex plasmas the particle sepa- ration is roughly 50 to 100 times the particle Supercoagulation Coagulation\u2014the process of two or more particles joining tog- ether\u2014requires that the particles touch and the cohesive (bin-ding) forces overcome any elastic (repulsive) processes that would make the particles \"bounce off\" each other. Numerous experiments have shown that the ability of particles to stick to each other depends on their surface material and collision dy-namics. For instance, it is much harder to get rubber balls to stick to-gether than snowfl akes. But when microparticles were injected into neutral gas and a coagulation rate 100,000 times faster than predicted (based on geometrical-collision estimates) was achieved, the results presented a challenge. It turned out that the particles injected into the neutral gas were charged: some positive, some negative. Thus, in addition to all the other cohesive forces, there was an electrostatic attraction as well as an induced-dipole attraction (two equal but opposite charges). The result-ing new theory predicted that below a critical level of particle density, there should be no supercoagulation and no power law in the distribu-tion of the size of particles. Subsequent tests carried out at lower levels of particles con rmed this. This is a perfect example of how the classical scienti c method works. A rapid coagulation (supercoagulation) process was observed in experiments carried out on the ISS, a theoretical explanation was developed, and its predictions were con rmed with further space-based experiments. This sequence shows the process of coag- ulation by consecutive sticking of parti-cles in slow (non-destructive) collisions. Results validated that adaptable human experimenters onboard the ISS are critical for following up on the basic experiments operated in \"robotic mode\" with available equipment.90 LOOKING UP: Europe's Quiet Revolution in Microgravity Research MAX-PLANCK-INSTITUTsize (they're far apart). Nevertheless, theory predicted that an electrorheological process might exist for complex plasmas, too. Testing the theory on the ISS required an ex- periment that the equipment in the PK labora- tory was not designed to accommodate. The hope was to observe \"something\"\u2014perhaps the ordering of a normal fl uid-like state into a string fl uid, where the molecules are arranged in loosely coupled chains of various lengths along a given direction. A string fl uid induces dramatic changes in the fl uid's physical proper- ties, a change that can be exploited in, among other things, shock absorbers. Of course, just in case the predictions were at least close, the cosmonauts needed to gener- ate three-dimensional scans through the com- plex plasma and provide the greatest amount of diagnostic results possible ( see Figure 5 ). The re sults ultimately con rmed the new theory and, in the process, validated the notion that adaptable human experimenters onboard the ISS are critical for following up basic experi- ments operated in a predetermined \"robotic mode\" with available equipment. Real Work for Soft Matter? Are there practical applications for soft matter? Very likely, but instant results should not be expected. German Chancellor Angela Merkel put it best when she said: \"People should not expect a basic science discovery made in the morning to deliver an industrial utilisation in the evening.\" For instance, it's generally not well known that about 20% of today's world-wide economy depends in some manner on quantum mechanics, a theory that rst took hold about 100 years ago. Nevertheless some concrete technological possibilities, derived from complex plasma re- search, are already being investigated. One is based on ne-particle control in plasma. The concept is to continuously remove dust in plasma etching and plasma vapour-deposition devices where this unavoidable by-product of the manu- facturing process causes signi cant problems, including reduced ef ciency. These devices are used for manufacturing items such as fl at screens, solar cells, and semiconductor chips. Other new developments are likely to occur in totally unexpected areas\u2014for instance, in \"plasma medicine,\" an emerging topic of consid- erable worldwide interest. The idea is to use room-temperature plasma in a \"touch-free\" process to treat bacterial and fungal skin diseas- es. The plasma penetrates the smallest pores and openings, but all the patient feels is a \"soothing, warm wind.\" There are numerous additional possibilities being discussed, includ- ing its use on chronic wounds, in dentistry, sur- gery and catheters. Even some cancer treat- ments may be feasible. The detection of a new state of matter\u2014 complex plasma and plasma's soft matter state\u2014will permit new experimental approach- es to the investigation of some major unsolved physics issues. These include an understanding of the organisation of matter at the individual particle level during phase transitions; obtain- ing a full theoretical kinetic picture of the ori- gin of turbulence; comprehending the scaling phenomena at the transition point between gas- es and fl uids at the kinetic level in phase space; and developing a comprehensive awareness of the fundamental stability principles of con- densed matter. For scientists, any major discovery is always an exciting opportunity, and this one is no ex- ception. It opens up new areas of investigation, creates opportunities for a better understand- ing of nature's puzzles, and may ultimately lead to new knowledge and applications that will bene t humanity. The fact that a science lab on the ISS played a critical role in revealing the plasma status of soft matter cannot be over- looked. The examples presented illustrate what can happen when experienced, well- trained experimenters working in weightless conditions are able to carry out unplanned, follow-up research. FIGURE 5. ELECTRIC CHANGES An electric eld applied to com- plex plasmas causes its properties to change by rearranging its parti-cles, a phenomenon called elec-trorheology.

Research shows that plants grown in near-weightless conditions are more sensitive to gravity than those grown under Earth's gravity. Plants will grow in micro-gravity, but they show dis-turbances in cell division, photosynthesis and stor-age reserves. Only when multiple gener-ations are grown in space will we get a clearer pic-ture of plant response to microgravity. \u2014The EditorsRoots grow downward while stems shoot upward. Clearly, plants \"sense\" gravity, but how? Years of research in gravitational biology have yielded some remarkable new insights\u2014and striking contradictions. By Dieter Volkmann, Anders Johnsson and Frantiek Baluka ZZLE PLANT S Animal and plant life have been inter- twined for hundreds of millions of years. Plants have oxygenated the atmo- sphere, and the fact that our planet can sustain such a large number of people today is almost entirely due to genetic mutations in wild wheat that occurred at the end of the last Ice Age. Charles Darwin not only alerted the world to the origin of species, he investigated and de- scribed the behaviour of plants in response to their environment, an environment that in- cludes gravity. A strange and interesting form of life, plants pose a conundrum: in the presence of gravity their roots grow downward and away from sunlight, while their stems and shoots grow upward and toward sunlight. How, then, do plants sense gravity? At a very basic level, ev- ery plant must have a mechanism that responds to gravitational force by transforming physical stimulus into a biological process. The study of these effects on living organ- isms is called gravitational biology. Not a new area of research, numerous investigations have produced a variety of results\u2014some expected, some unexpected, but always fascinating. A his- torical review of these data reveals different pieces of the larger puzzle\u2014the remarkable adaptability of plants to a condition never en- countered in evolution: the near-weightlessness of microgravity.

When we began our research, access to the real envi- ronment of microgravity in space was limited. So our research began in laboratories with equipment that simulates the absence of gravity: clinostats and centrifuges, random positioning machines and magnetic levitation. Later we were able to use sounding rockets, providing up to six minutes of microgravity. In addition, we also set out to study the other side of the equa- tion\u2014hypergravity, or forces of gravity greater than those experienced on Earth. By 1983 we were able to get out of the labs and into space. For experiments in microgravity, we used cress and lentil plants because both ger- quickly. In cress seedlings cultivated dur- on the centrifuge under Earth's gravi- tational conditions, the plant roots showed low- er sensitivity to gravitational force compared with those cultivated in microgravity chambers. These findings suggested that an organism grown in microgravity conditions adapts its bio- logical processes in such a way that the organ- ism's sensitivity to gravity is affected. Further experiments performed by three Eu- ropean research groups demonstrated that roots from cress and lentil plants are in general high-ly sensitive to gravitational force. Three plant samples were used: one on the ground, one in orbit in a centrifuge that varied its speed (its ac- celeration force can mimic the effects of gravity) between Earth's gravity and one thousandth of Earth's gravity, and the third, also in orbit, un- der microgravity conditions ( see Figure 1 ). Results from the plants in the centrifuge were the most surprising, indicating that the initial ef- fects can be seen at values between one thou- sandth and one hundredth of the Earth's gravity (10 -2 and 10-3g, Earth = 1g). Their root growth not only showed the weakest response to gravity but it also mirrored the type of growth seen in water. The results from the centrifuge were what one would expect from a plant in the neutral buoyancy of water (where a body's weight de- creases by the amount of water it displaces). At some point in distant history, this was probably exactly how plant evolution began.

A Venus fl y trap, for example, will close after consecutive stimula- tion of just two sensory hairs, but not one.

BRIEGLEB AND SP-1222; 1999 (Statolith positioning)the minimum value necessary for a response. After two to three stimuli, the cress plants re- sponded clearly to repeated stimuli. Actin' Similar If plants and humans show similar sensitivity to microgravity, there is presumably a reason. One place to look is at the role of the molecule complex actomyosin. The actin family is a diverse and evo- lutionarily ancient group of proteins, shared by nearly all forms of organic life. Under normal gravitational conditions, actin's main roles in both the plant and animal kingdoms are that of structural support as a so-called cytoskeleton within the cells and as an intracellular transport system. Actin combines with another protein, myosin, to form the complex actomyosin, whose role is movement. Given that these proteins share the important role of providing intracellular \"scaffolding\" that responds to gravity, they may also share other common behaviours that evolved and adapted to the same state of Earth's gravity. This hypothesis was tested for the rst time on sounding rocket fl ights using roots from cress plants and single cells called rhizoids from the green algae Chara that function like a root. A re- action was seen within six minutes of exposure to microgravity in both the rhizoids and in sta-tocytes, specialised cells in the cress root caps that are involved in gravity perception. Within that short time, heavy (with respect to the cell cy-toplasm) and sedimentous particles called stato- liths, which exist in a web of actin and which set-tle like a sediment, moved in a direction opposite to the original gravity vector. To isolate gravity as the stimulating force, chemical compounds were added to destroy the actomyosin system. Under these conditions, the statoliths did not move. These results indicate that under normal conditions the position of statoliths is deter- mined by two counteracting forces: an internal force exerted by the actomyosin system and an external gravitational force. Statoliths can reach a stable position in microgravity, but to do so re- quires a functioning actomyosin system. Longer and more sophisticated experiments became possible with the advent of 10-day Low speed centrifuge microscope (NIZEMI). FIGURE 2.

CIRCUMNUTATION This time-lapse sequence of Arabidopsis was recorded over a period of 75 minutes. As the plant grows, it revolves around a central gravitational plumb line. The direction of these revolutions is represented by the blue arrow. When Charles Darwin rst developed his circumnutation hypothe- sis, he realised it was possible to measure these movements by using markers placed on the plant and recording the change in position over time. This principle is still used today; the yellow dots show the change in position at different time intervals. 12:4213:0213:57 13:32 SPACE CHANNEL / PHIL SAUNDERS, SOURCE: B. G. B. SOLHEIM AND A. JOHNSSON (NORWEGIAN UNIVERSITY OF SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY)Spacelab missions. On one of these missions in 1996, one group used ESA's Biorack facility to observe the positions of statoliths in lentil root cells when exposed to different gravitational conditions, including the absence of gravity. Again the role of the actomyosin system in sta- tolith positioning was evident ( see Figure 2 ). Feel the Rhythm While Darwin and his son had emphasised that plant organs move in relation to external infl u-ences like gravity and light, they also asserted that plant motion has an endogenous or inner \"character.\" They called a plant's rotational, rhythmic movement circumnutation, and it is affected both by gravity and by internal pro- cesses. In simple terms, circumnutation can be described as a spiral movement around a central axis such as the plumb line. If you were to observe a quick-growing plant for a block of time, you would see the tip nod successively around the points of a compass ( see Figure 3 ). www.spacefl ight.esa.int 97 Can clear differences in the behaviour of cell groups when exposed to microgravity be explained by the differences in family or species, or are there other forces at work? And if so what? The reason for this is the unequal growth rates of plant cells on either side of the central axis. Cells on one side of the plant's axis stretch, while those on the other side do not; then vice versa. These rhythmic and synchronized chang- es occur as cells periodically change their shape around the plant stem in order to grow upward. To create uni ed revolutions, plant cells must be in tune with and respond to the movements of their neighbours. The period of circumnutation in plants fl uctuates widely, typically between 30 and 120 minutes and amplitudes vary. Darwin's hypothesis that these vigorous movements of plant shoots around the plumb line had an inner origin could be questioned since gravity-oriented movements could be the deci- sive mechanism. In fact, several experiments point to the importance of gravity in rhythmic movement. Some plants stop their circumnuta- tions under weightless conditions simulated by a clinostat; in others, the period of circumnuta- tions changes on a centrifuge; and mutant plants that do not grow according to the pull of gravity (agravitropic plants) have shown less movement. To test Darwin's hypothesis, studies on the infl uence of gravity on plant circumnutation were carried out during the rst Spacelab mis- sion in 1983 when an international consortium from the US and Europe used the stems of sun- fl owers for its investigations. Careful recordings showed that circumnutations did not totally cease in weightlessness. Even if their amplitude diminished drastically, rotations were less fre-quent and had a shorter duration. It would ap- pear that Darwin's hypothesis, put forward more than 100 years ago, is basically correct: plants do have an endogenous \"character,\" but gravity plays a role as well. Details, Details More than a century later, what Darwin called \"character\" is the study of plant biomechanics, a large eld concerned with the mechanical prin- ciples that govern a living organism, right down to the function of each living cell. In plants, an important area of biomechanical research is the cell wall. Cell wall components, in particular the composite of cellulose and lignin\u2014the latter is exclusively found in land-based plants\u2014have been characterized as the \"backbone\" of plants living on land. Because these plants evolved in an environment subject to gravity, long-term exper- iments in microgravity were expected to prove that they need those backbone-like cell wall components to function properly. Two teams were involved in this investigation, but came to different conclusions. An American group could not nd substantial differences in cellulose micro bril (very ne bre-like strand) organization, cell wall thickening and lignin composition in wheat seedlings after 10 days of spacefl ight compared to ground controls. As a re- sult all plants were essentially identical in size, height and cell wall thickness, regardless of the gravitational eld they experienced. However, a Japanese group obtained different results under similar microgravity conditions. They saw increased elongation accompanied by an increased mechanical extensibility of cell walls and decreased cellulose volume for differ- ent plant species and organs. While cell wall composition and the underlying metabolism do vary according to plant families, sometimes even to the species level, the question remains: can clear differences in the behaviour of cell groups when exposed to microgravity be explained by the differences in family or species, or are there other forces at work? And if so what? Space-grown plants also showed a reduction in certain photosynthetic activities. Under light- saturated photosynthetic conditions, the trans- port rate of electrons was reduced by 28%. This transport process begins when chlorophyll re- acts to light and loses an electron, which is then passed through a chain of individual reactions as a key source of energy. There were also chang- es reported in chlorophyll content, structure and number of chloroplasts within plant cells, and a decrease in the number and size of starch grains in the chloroplasts. These results have been supported by other experiments. No dif- ferences, however, were found in photosynthet- ic activity at the moderate light levels. Again, results from these early experiments were fraught with contradictions. The most re- cent space experiments were conducted using 98 LOOKING UP: Europe's Quiet Revolution in Microgravity Research D. VOLKMANN ET AL. IN NATURWISSENSCHAFTEN , VOL. 73, PAGES 438-441; 1986.more advanced equipment with careful controls, and no remarkable differences in plant mor- phology and cell structures have been reported. In reviewing this research, one of the things we have learned is the importance of controlling for changes in the gas exchange process. In micro- gravity, convection\u2014physically driven heat transfer\u2014is prevented. When that movement is reduced, exchange of gases such as oxygen, car- bon dioxide and ethylene is incomplete and has to be supported by sophisticated equipment. During early phases of development, seed- lings\u2014particularly their roots\u2014consume oxy- gen. In the later stages, the concentration of car- bon dioxide as well as ethylene dominates plant growth and development. Thus, sophisticated gas control systems are critical to separate the effects of microgravity, heat transfer and even radiation. Early experiments in microgravity did not provide adequate control for gas ex- change and created a stress situation for the samples. This might be one explanation for the divergent and sometimes contradictory results. Sex in Space It is important to note that not only is micro- gravity an extremely new area of plant research, but this research is limited by the time available in space to carry out the work. Simply put, plants take time to grow. Sounding rockets pro- vide only 12 minutes at most; ESA's Spacelab offered around 10 days. To really move forward in this eld, we need to observe what happens when plants reproduce in microgravity. Only when a new generation of seeds can be grown in microgravity will any long-term developmental effects between seedlings be observed. So far most reproductive plant experiments have been performed on the Russian space sta- tion Mir and more recently on the International Space Station. One study showed that cell and organ polarity of young seedlings and mature plants cultivated in microgravity did not devi- ate signi cantly from control groups. Several corresponding reports agree that gravity is not required for germination, proper growth or de- velopment of seedlings, plants and even embry- os of the second generation. Nevertheless, the quality of seeds from gen- erations grown in microgravity is small fl owering plant wide- ly used as a model organism in plant biology, has been cultivated on Mir. Seeds from these plants had 20% less storage tissue than found in seeds harvested from ground controls. Examination of the cell chemistry of storage reserves showed that starch was retained in the spacefl ight group, whereas protein and lipids were the primary storage reserves in ground control seeds. Protein bodies of plants produced in space were 44% smaller than those in the ground control seeds. Developmental markers indicate that seeds and pollen produced in microgravity were physiolog- ically younger than those produced under Earth's gravity. From those results, researchers hypothesized that microgravity limits gas mix- ing even inside tissues and that the resulting gas composition surrounding the seeds and pollen retards their development. Other researchers in the US and Europe have observed differences in developmental process- es at the cellular level between in-fl ight speci- mens and controls ( see Figure 4 ). These differ- ences were not only related to storage of mate- rials such as starch, lipids and proteins but to cell division when anomalies were seen in chro- mosomes, cytoskeletal elements and cell wall components. In particular, one report illustrat- ed the negative effects of microgravity on the cell division cycle. The initial phase of this pro-cess was prolonged; and then, when the chro- mosomes began to divide, breakage and frac- ture occurred. This suggests that microgravity might exert stress on fast-developing seedlings as well as on cell cultures. Although plants can adapt to this environment, coping with multiple FIGURE 4.

PETERS (BOTANY INSTITUTE, UNIVERSITY OF BONN)effects from reduced gravitational force, de- creased convection as well as radiation are prob- ably responsible for these outcomes. Gene Machines Given the complexity of a living organism's response to gravity, genetics must play a part in those regulatory processes. Experiments have been performed in ground-based laboratories using microscopic array analysis with Arabidop- sis thaliana . The results showed differences in the expression pattern for up to 200 genes that code for different classes of proteins including transcription factors, cell wall modifying enzymes, cytoskeletal elements and signaling molecules. The relative increase or decrease in several genetic components occurred quickly\u2014 within two minutes after changing the plants from a vertical (normal) to a horizontal position (see Figure 5 ). Because there are few research opportunities on long term space fl ights, most of the currently available data were achieved with experiments performed under hypergravity and under simu- lated weightlessness. Results from two groups using young seedlings and cell cultures of Ara- bidopsis thaliana suggest that changes occur in gene expression under various gravitational conditions and in different classes of genes; and changes in the latter have been seen in plants under other forms of stress. By comparing the expression patterns of selected genes from Ara- bidopsis thaliana seedlings, data showed that genes coding for cell wall modifying enzymes, cytoskeletal elements and signalling molecules are regulated in an opposite manner under hy- pergravity versus simulated microgravity on a clinostat. Adaptation and Exploration Viewing these gravity-based experiments retro- spectively, we begin to form a more complete picture of the various molecular and cellular effects that range from disturbances in cell divi- sion to changes in photosynthetic and reserve storage products. Because these ndings often appear contradictory, it is important to inter- pret them in the context of plant type, culture conditions and experimental procedures. Nevertheless, a common theme can be teased out from this wealth of data: plants will nally develop under these stressful conditions more or less normally, and they are able to produce seeds over subsequent generations. These results are a testament to the remarkable capacity of plants to adapt to novel stress situations never encoun-tered during the evolutionary process. This is undoubtedly good news for astro- nauts on future missions as live, growing plants would be a potential resource for food and oxy- gen on long journeys into the depths of the solar system. However, there is an even more funda- mental aspect to the research. In almost all elds of biology, the deeper you probe as a re- searcher, the more complicated things appear. So the more you can isolate particular factors, such as gravity, the clearer the picture becomes. It took the discovery of the Rosetta Stone to re- veal that Egyptian hieroglyphics were not in- comprehensible pictographs, but a complex and sophisticated language. The \"character\" of plants is ultimately what we are exploring, and future experiments in space must include research into sensing and signaling of gravity, gravity as a driving factor of evolution and plant adaptation to various stress situations. Obviously if plants are to be- come important in human exploration of the so- lar system, then we need to know much more about the production of multiple generations, the maintenance of seed quality and mass pro- duction, especially if we want to use them for food and oxygen production. Plants might also contribute to the psychological wellbeing of as- tronauts traveling vast distances across the so- lar system. Meanwhile, back on Earth, in a time when food production has suddenly become a major issue, the more we can learn about plants the better\u2014and microgravity research is now a part of that 'toolbox'.

The rockets provide up to 13 minutes of high quality microgravity levels at a relative low cost. The short turnaround time and flexible working procedures make it possible for the scientist to include the latest ideas in their experiments. The experiments performed on sounding rockets have produced high quality scientific results in many disciplines. Swedish Space Corporation has been a provider of complete sounding rocket systems since 1987. wwwwwwwwwww.ssssssscccc..sssseee A A AA AAscsscscssieieieieentntntntntttttisisisisisisisissist tttttt t twowowowoworkrkrkrkkkkkks ss sss s ssononononoo s s s samamamamplplplplpplplplesesesesssssss a a a a a aabobobobobbututututututtutut t t ttto o oooo oo bebebebe l lllauauauauuuncncncncncnheheheheheheheheeehed d d d d ddasasasasasasasa pp p p ppppp ararararararat t t t t tt ttofofofofofoofo a a a a m m m mmiciciciccicicicrororororrorororgrgrgrgrgrgrggravavavavavavavitititiitiitity y y yy yyyyy y scscscscscscsccieeieeencncncncce e e e eeepapapaapaaaapaayyylylylylyyyoaoaoaoaoaoaoaoaoad.d.d.d.d.d.dddd T T T T TT TThehehehehehh E E E EEEEsrsrsrranananananananngeggegegegegegege S S S S S SSSSpapapapapapapappaapcececececcececc CeCeCeCeCeCeCentnntntnereree "}
