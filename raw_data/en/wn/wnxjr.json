Reliable incidence and prevalence datay for diseases are generally not available in the developing world, and these data are weak in most of the OECDY countries. As an exception, prevalence and incidence of cancers are sometimes available as these h--e been the subject of international investigation for several decades. Registries of cancer cases have been established in many countries, including in some locations in China. Only in exceptional cases is similar information available for other diseases however. Health plainners throughout the world are thus often constrained to relying on sample surveys and on mortality data for choosing priorities for expenditure of health resources. Morbidity data in most countries are even more scarce, and of fragile reliability, and China is no exception. What is known of morbidity and its trends is discussed in individual disease sections of this report. All epidemiological data is of course subject to errors in its collection, in cause of death and illness coding, in accuracy of classification, and so forth. However, mortality data!/ provide the most accessible and reliable source for examining the health problems of the nation. These are examined from several different perspectives (below) to develop an overview of current health status. V Prevalence is a measure of the number of cases of a disease existing in a given population at a point of time, usually expressed as a percentage or rate per thousand population; incidence is a measure of the number of new cases of the disease occurring at or during a period of time, usually expressed as an annual rate per 1000 population. Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD) is an economic grouping of nations that in-ludes most of Europe, Canada, the United States and Japan. Most of the data used in this report comes from the DSP reporting system (see Box 1.2 in main report) which requires hospital certification of the cause of death. Even so, autopsies are seldom performed in China and it can be expected that, even with the best of efforts, not to mention the inevitable pressures of time, other business and lust lack of experience, that a share of all deaths will be misreported. -1.2 - 2. It is important to note that the national data used in this reportsJ reflect a widely varying situation which is changing dramatically with passing years. China's health status is heterogeneous across different regions. Important regional and local differences exist in epidemiology and disease impact and are not, for the most part, addressed in this report. 3. Crude Mortality Rates. Detailed mortality rates from the Disease Surveillance Points (jSPs -see Box 1.2, main report and Annex Map 1) by sex and by urban and rural areas are presented in Annex Table 1.5. Age- standardized, age-specific, and disease-specific mortality data are presented in Annex Table 1.6. Heart disease, stroke and cancer accounted for 63% of total mortality in 1986 (68% in urban areas; 60% in rural areas). These diseases affected males and females about equally (63% versus 64%). Injuries were the fourth leading cause of death in all categories and areas. These four causes of mortality account for 72% of all death in China.5/ Other chronic, non-communicable diseases such as diabetes, kidney disease, liver cirrhosis and psychological and neurological diseases would bring the total to over 76% of mortality (see Annex Table 1.7 for DSP population). 4. Overall mortality rates provide only one measure of the illness burden. They simply report the annual number of people per 100,000 population who die from a given disease. The age-, gender- and location- specific aspects of those deaths are disguised within the number. In a society with a large proportion of children, reliance on overall death data would hide the severity of the chronic diseases among adults for example; conversely, the importance of infectious and endemic diseases among children can be obscured by the overall figures in a society with a large proportion of adults. 5. Annex Charts 1.4 through 1.6 show some aspects of chronic disease mortality in China and reference points of comparison with the United States, with the population divided into three subsets -over age 65, ages 25 through 64, and ages 15 through 24. 1986 data are used for most of the epidemiological analysis in this report. An identical data set for 1985 became available part way through the analytical work and was examined for its consistency with 1986. In general China's experience for 1985 showed slightly worse mortality from the chronic diseases. To be conservative in approach, and because time consuming manipulation of these large data sets would have added nothing of substance to the themes and conclusions of this report only 1986 data were used as the basis for both analysis and for projections of future epidemiology. Subsequently, 1987 and 1988 data have become available. As data sets become more comprehensive and provide a time series it is expected that China will be able to substantially refine and improve upon the anal.As contained here. In this report, injuries are treated as one of the chronic, non- communicable diseases. Annex Chapter 2 discusses injuries in detail. 1.3 - 6. Older Adults (Over age 64 -Annex Chart 1.1). The leading causes of death for older adults in China are the same as the U.S. but the total mortality rate in China is still low v5,046/100,000), compared to the U.S. in earlier periods. This is most likely because those Chinese who have survived to old age up to now have been physically healthier than their contemporary U.S. counterparts. Strong natural health selection forces in China may result in. a few more years of relatively low mortality rates amongst the elderly. As the impact of longer exposure to risk factors begins to become apparent, death rates amongst the elderly can be expected to increase.

Adults (25-64 years old -Annex Chart 1.2). The leading causes of death for the productive age groups are also the same for the U.S. and China but with marked differences in characteristics. Cancer already affects adult Chinese in roughly the same percentage (30%) as it does Americans. Heart disease is today relatively less important and injury and stroke are significantly more important for Chinese in this age group relative to their counterparts in the U.S. The overall mortality rate in China is much less (337/100,000) thar. in the U.S. Part of the reason for this is demographic - -1.4 - there are relatively more Chinese in their twenties and thirties in this data sample and relatively more Americans in their fifties and sixties. As the Chinese population ages, overall mortality rates for this age group can be expected to rise, assuming the disease specific rates just remain stable, because the chronic diseases tend to have much higher mortality rates in older age groups.

Adolescent and Young Adults shares (Annex Chart 1.3) show little diffarence between China and the U.S., with injury already accounting for more than half of all young Chinese deaths. These external causes of death (injuries, suicides, etc.) are important causes of mortality and morbidity in both countries and are an obvious health priority (see Annex Chapter 2 for a detailed discussion of injuries in China, their composition and distribution). Modestly higher rates of heart disease mortality for young Chinese are mainly due to rheumatic heart disease. -1.5 - 9. Overall, Chinese mortality rates for these three age groups show a picture of chronic diseases which generally do not yet affect the age specific groups as severely as the same groups in the U.S., but with the chronic diseases account for about the same proportions of total mortality. 10. Age-Adiusted Mortality gates provide another way to examine the nature of the illness burden and health care priorities. Some fraction of over time in crude mortality rates of the chronic diseases is due to demographic effects. As there are now more middle aged and elderly Chinese relative to the total population (than previously) the apparent mortality rate attributable to the chronic diseases would be higher in comparison to the past. To account for this demographic effect, mortality rates from different periods of time can be adjusted to the same hypothetical population distribution. Age-adjusted mortality rates remove the effects of demographic as opposed to epidemiological trends. Unfortunately, there are no reliable disease- and age-specific mortality data available for China in earlier time periods.'

A forthcoming book by Chen, Campbell, Li and Peto (Oxford University Press) will contain more detailed information on mortality reported from the 1973-75 survey. In this report a discussion of the epidemiologic changes for cancers in the last decade is presented in Chapter II. -1.6 - the epidemiological transition for China, as opposed to the demographic transition, can be demonstrated by comparisons with other countries. 11. Comparison of age-adjusted mortality rates in both China (1986 data) and in the U.S. (1985 data),Y shows similar shares and rates of chronic disease burden (Annex Chart 1.4). China has ca slightly higher 6verall mortality rate (634/100,000) than does the U.S. but the same proportion (73%) of total mortality in both countries is accounted for by the chronic diseases and injury.

The shares of chronic disease mortality change only modestly with the aging population but the mortality rates, overall and disease-specific, increase by nearly 50% (total mortality of 899/100,000). Expressed another way, if chronic disease mortality rates become no higher than today overall mortality rates will increase about 50 iJust from the effect of thi- aging population. This is an optimistic, and very unlikely, assumption. Some chronic disease mortality rates are likely to be considerably higher in the future unless a massive effort at disease prevention and health promotion is soon begun and sustained for many years. Annex Chart 1.5 Age Adjusted Rates for Major Causes of Death in China, 1986 (Total 899J100,000) Heart Diseases Cancer to the U.S. 1970 Census Populaticn Chronic obstructive lung disease has been grouped under heart disease in Annex Charts 1.1 through 1.4 to make the two classification systems comparable. Some portion of \"others\" in the China data series is also chronic obstructive lung disease and tho \"heart disease\" category is therefore slightly underestimated. -1.8 - 13. Years of Premature Life Lost (YPLL) is a measurement of the hypothetical years of life lost annually due to premature death (death at any age prior to normal life expectancy, for China), or death prior to an arbitrary definition of economically productive life -age 65, is commonly usedY. Using both definitions for YPLL, Annex Table 1.8 summarizes the burden of illness on China today from chronic and infectious diseases in terms of YPLL. All YPLL measurements give added emphasis in statistical presentation to those illnesses which affect the younger and middle age groups. The death of a 64 year old worker only deprives society of one year of potentially productive life (assuming the worker was healthy). The death of a 44 year old father from heart disease costs society, and his family, 21 years of productive care and support. The death of a child from preventable injury at age ten is measured as very costly to society by YPLL methods. This may or may not be appropriate, depending on the objective of the analysis for which YPLL statistics are being used. YPLL measures may not reflect underlying morbidity conditions as well as mortality rates do. However, YPLL does present an easily understood measure of the total burden of death on a society. 14. China's premature life loss each year is far greater than might intuitively be expected. It represents an enormous burden on the young and middle aged members of society and a huge loss to the total output of society. No society burdened with the annual premature loss of about 60 million years of life (equivalent to about US$18 billion annually at today's per capita output) can afford to ignore this in development of its health strategy. Prevention of a share of this premature life loss should rank high among health and economic priorities. 15. Gender Differences in Mortality are important to consider in assessing health status and health strategy. Annex Charts 1.6 and 1.7 show the relative burden on women and men from 16 leading diseases as measured by mortality rates and YPLL respectively. The horizontal axes are the ratios of male to female mortality (+) and of female to male mortality (-). A ratio of 1:1 would indicate that men and women are affected equally. Ratios higher than 1:1 indicate men are more affected and vice versa. Men clearly emerge as being affected worse than women for most of these diseases and the notable exceptions suggest areas where health care strategy might focus more on needs of women. Health strategies to address the key problems killing men in China also emerge from these Annex Charts. As will be explored later (Annex Chapters 2 and 3) many of these diseases can only effectively be reduced through well designed and funded programs of primary prevention. Very little difference would be shown in any health status indicators (mortality rates, YPLL or ratios) from programs and investments which mainly treat diseases among people who are already ill patients alive. YPLL with age 65 as the standard is convenient. but completely arbitrary, as a definition of the \"productive\" years of life. In many parts of the world, i;icluding China, many persons remain active and productive in both economic and social terms for many years beyond this age. -1.9 - 16. Urban-Rural Differentials in Mortality also help to focus health programs and identify priorities. Annex Charts 1.8 and 1.9 show the relative burden on urban and rural areas from the same 16 diseases, again measured in terms of both mortality and YPLL. Rural areas are affected relatively more than urbani areas by certain communicable diseases, by some chronic diseases (e.g. liver cancer) and by injuries. Urban areas are affected more by the chronic diseases which are primarily related to lifestyle, smoking and diets. The gradual spread of these risk factors from urban to rural areas throughout China is discussed in more detail in Annex Chapter 3. These charts indicate the need for near-term focus on treatment of some diseases and on an aggressive apDroach to prevention for most of the chronic diseases and for injuries. 17. A trend which can be expected to emerge over the next decade or so as China's rural areas progress further in the epidemiological transition is that crude mortality rates for rural areas will fall because of today's younger age structure and shorter exposure to the main chronic disease risk factors relative to urban areas. At the same time, urban crude death rates will rise as a result of longer chronic disease risk exposures and an aging population profile. At some point China's rural areas will appear favored relative to the cities with lower mortality and morbidity rates. in the next century this trend will reverse with both urban and rural areas converging to higher rates of death. 18. The value for China in further developing and refining its disease surveillance system should be obvious. Not only can areas for health strategy be more clearly identified for discussion and debate but comparisons can be made with other times and places (both within and without China) to assess progress, to gain a perspective on what the future may hold in store and to select and develop health strategies.

This section provides a detailed review of the leading chronic diseases in China. It provides the basis for development of strategy based on present epidemiology, for comparisons with other countries, and for the detailed assumptions underlying the projection model of the likely future course of chronic disease in China (Arnex Chapter 4). In order to serve the needs of non-medical readers it includes brief descriptions of each of the main diseases. For medical readers and epidemiologists it provides detailed information, in footnotes and text, intended to help reach agreement on the reasonableness of the assumptions which have been used in the projection model. Detail is also included to provide the basis for the discussion of strategy options in prevention and in treatment contained in later sections. Readers who are not interested in the level of detai' contained here can proceed directly to Annex Chapter 3, Risk Factors, with only minimal loss of continuity and can refer back to this section as needed for details which may interest them. 2. The diseases treated in this section are cardiac and cerebrovascular diseases, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, various cancers, injuries, and diabetes. Together, these are the major killers and disablers of China's people today. The changing age structure and the probable increasing incidence of some of these diseases will adversely affect China severely in the next several decades. The Cardiovascular and Cardio-Pulmonary Diseases 3. Cardiovascular and cardio pulmonary diseases are a leading cause of illness and death throughout the world. They already account for nearly half of all mortality in China. The relative shares and mortality rates of the main diseases are shown in Annex Chart 2.1 for urban and rural areas. In the West over the last fifty years the cardiovascular diseases have risen sharply as a cause of illness and death and then have widely and significantly declined in incidence and as a cause of mortality in some countries, most notably the United States. China may have the opportunity to avoid some of the increase in these diseases that plagued the West. It may also be able to take steps to bring about the early onset of declines in those areas and diseases where rates of illness and death are already high. The case for an aggressive preventive strategy is strong on account of several facts about cardiovascular disease in China: (1) large variations exist in the incidence of the disease among different population groups; (2) its frequency is strongly associated with socioeconomic factors and the distribution of modifiable risk characteristics; and (3) dramatic changes are seen, upward, and downward, in reported cardiovascular deaths. These factors all imply that prevention is possible if China adopts the right strategy and policies. -2.2 - Anmex Chart 2.1 China: Mortality Rates and Shares Circulatory and Cardiopulmonary Diseases(Ages 35-74: rates/100,000 population) Rural China Urban China (Total rate 370) (Total rate 415) Hypertensive H.D. Rate 23 8% Rate e1 16% Source: DSP dats. 1986 4. Three cardiovascular diseases are treated in this section. Rheumatic Heart Disease and Chronic Obstructive Lung Disease are included in the following sections.!/ t/ Congenital Heart Disease is not included here although it too is important in China. It involves heart valve malformations, heart chamber defects, arterial and blood vessel weaknesses and other heart defects that can occur during gestation. Some of these defects may be genetic and others may be environmentally caused. Disability, early death, and predisposition to easy infection from other causes can be the common result. Specific risk factors for China are unknown. No time series data are available which would give even a crude basis for esti-ating further trends in relation to those experienced in the developed countries. This disease will not be further treated in the text or in the projection model. It should be noted, however, that congenital heart disease is likely to continue to be important factor in terms of YPLL (an estimated 2 million YPLL at present, or 3% of total YPLL). .t will also be important in terms of the present backlog and future caseload of curative surgery for congenital abnormalities needed to enable those affected to become more fully productive citizens. The chapters on hospital planning and management and on technology deal further with these aspects. -2.3 - Ischemic Heart Disease (Coronary Heart Disease, Angina, Myocardial Infarction). The manifestations of ischemic heart disease are heart muscle deprivation of needed blood-born nutrients and oxygen. Obstruction can occur in any of the coronary arteries (which bring blood, nutrients and oxygen to the heart muscle and other structures). Obstruction to one of these arteries can result in injury or death to an area of the heart's muscles causing sudden carica death from ventricular fibrillation or myocardial infarction. The cause of obstruction is mainly underlying vascular disease (atherosclerosis, or artery disease) in which lesions consisting of cells, fibrous tissue, and lipids grow into the lumen to reduce blood flow and predispose to formation of intra-arterial thrombi, often with accompanying pain (angina). Cerebrovascular Disease (Stroke) involves the sudden deprivation of parts of the brain from blood flow (and oxygen) due to either cerebral infarction or hemorrhage. Infarction occurs with blockage of a cerebral. vessel atherosclerotic plaque or a blood clot. Hemorrhagic stoke occurs when bleeding occurs into the brain, often at the site of a burst cerebral arterial aneurysm. Hypertensive Heart Disease. High blood pressure can cause the heart muscle to overwork and enlarge abnormally. This enlargement ultimately weakens the heart, causing heart failure. In addition, high blood pressure can cause damage to heart valves and can accelerate the process of atherosclerosis. High blood pressure is also associated with aneurysms of arteries -- particularly the arteries to che brain. Chinese Epidemiology and Trends 5. Over the last 20 years coronary heart disease, stroke and hypertensive heart disease mortality in China have been increasing in relative importance by virtue of infectious and endemic diseases having declined. Crude mortality data (see Annex Table 1.2) shows large absolute increases but these data cannot be age adjusted and credible statements about trends and their pace are therefcre difficult to make. 6. Data that demonstrate an increase in age-specific mortality rates (reflecting changing epidemiologic patterns and exposure to risk factors) are -2.4 - fragmentary.!/ Northern, urban areas have already long been documented as having growing rates of cardiovascular disease.!/ In four urban districts of Beijing mortality from heart diseases and from cerebrovascular disease in 1958 was 71/100,000 (10.8% of all deaths) and 107/100,000 (16.3%) respectively. By 1979 these rates had increased to 141/100,000 (25.3%) and 152/100,000 (27.3%) respectively. By 1979 cardiovascular disease accounted for 52.6% of all deaths in Beijing. Similar time series data is not available for the country as a whole. However, 1976 statistics from 12 major cities showed an average coronary heart disease mortality rate of 29.6/100,000 with the highest, 51.5/- 100,000 in Tianjin. Stroke mortality rate for these cities averaged 138/100,000.9. The 1986 Disease Surveillance Points data for cardiovascular disease (CVD) and cardio-pulmonary disease are summarized in Annex Table 2.1 !/ This would be a productive field for some concentration of valuable epidemiologic research by the medical universities in China. Nearly 16,000 cardiac cases in two Shanghai hospitals over 1950-1980 were reviewed for changes in etiologic types of heart disease. Major categoric changes noted were as follows: Freguency (%) of Etiologic Tyies of Heart Disease in Three Decades 1950s 1960s 1970s Rheumatic 50.3 43.7 29.7 Coronary 6.7 15.7 26.0 Congenital 2.1 11.7 17.0 Hypertensive 17.7 6.8 7.1 10.1 7.5 Source: Chen Hao-zhu, etal, Chinese Medical Journal, 98:151-156, March, 1985. Other studies have reported rates of coronary heart disease which are as high in the south as in the north and which show the same age specific increased risk trends as apply in the West.

A reappraisal of the changing proportion of the various types of heart disease in Shanghai and its relationship to serum cholesterol levels. Chinese Medical Journal, 97(3): 171-174, 1984. 9./ Ten rural regions averaged a 94/100,000 mortality rate from stroke for 1976. The data in the text cited just before this footnote are all from Wu Ying-Kai, et al, Epidemiologic Studies of Cardiovascular Diseases in China, Chinese Medical Journal, 96(3):201-105, 1983. -2.5 - and Adnnex Chart 2.2. They show averages which are indicative of the overall rates of CVD, of coronary heart disease (CHD) and of stroke perhaps having increased further yet, and nationwide, from the levels reported earlier from the small scale studies. Cardiovascular and cardiopulmonary diseases now appear to account for about half of all deaths in the urban population. Urban areas may have reached average levels of CHD mortality which were near the reported maximums in the 1976 survey. 7. The relative importance of chronic circulatory disease increases with age and in general men have higher rates than women. Among the five leading circulatory diseases in China stroke, chronic obstructive lung disease (cor- pulmonale) and coronary heart disease are the most important in terms of disability and death. Their relati-*e impact, by age and sex, also is shown in Annex Chart 2.2 Annex Chart 2.2 Circulatory Disease Deaths by Cause, Age and Sex 80K1 @01. 4.~~~~~~~~~~~~4; C.0- (in thousands [K=000's], 1986) -2.6 - 8. Cardiovascular disease studies in China using well-defined and standardized criteria are very few but have been reviewed for indicators of mortality, incidence and trends with these diseases.:/ Several of the large scale studies have been underway since the early 1980s with international collaboration and can be expected to yield valuable epidemiologic information during the next 5 -10 years. Micro-level, community control studies!/ of cardiovascular disease have also been underway for some years. While results are not directly comparable with community disease control projects undertaken in the West, the general experience and trend to date corroborates the evidence that has emerged in the early phase of similar control projects done in the West, i.e. that large declines in CVD mortality and morbidity are possible to achieve with good primary and secondary prevention programs.:! These trends also correspond to the overall declines in cardiovascular disease observed in a number of countries.!/ As in the West, it seems clear that well-organized community control projects for the cardiovascular diseases can have major beneficial effects in China; it remains unclear however, in China as in the West, whether these programs can be replicated and sustained over the many decades required to bring about major, continuing changes in the incidence of CVD. 9. In general, acute myocardial infarction (AMI) and sudden cardiac death (SCD) are thought to be relatively uncommon in China, as they have been in Japan. Fragmentary information is beginning to become available however, 5/ Major cardiovascular disease studies in China include the following: the Cardiovascular Risk Factor Study, is underway since 1981 by The Cardiovascular Institute of Fu Wai Hospital, Guangdong provincial Cardiovascular Institute and 7 other centers in collaboration with the U.S. National Heart Lung and Blood Institute, NIH; the pathogenesis of hyypertension is being researched by the Shanghai Hypertension Research Institute; the Beijing Heart Lung and Blood Vessel Center in collaboration with 15 other provincial and municipal centers has been working on the WHO Monica Project since 1983 (some of these same centers have joined the Heart Disease Prevention Project recently initiated with Japanese renearchers). 9/ These include the following: the Capital Iron and Steel Piant, the Chaoyang and Shijingshan districts of Beijing, and county level programs in at least five provinces. 9./ Over varying periols in the Chinese projects sizeable reductions of mortality and morbidity of cardiac and cerebrovascular disease have been achieved within the limited population bases. Hypertension has beer. controlled in 70-80% of cases; cardiovascular disease mortality rates have declined by 20-30% and stroke mortality by 30-40%. !/ Western experience varies in detail but shows similar order of magnitude trends in the same direction as the Chinese experiments - e.g. Minnesota, Stanford, Pawtucket Heart Programs; Belgium, and Oslo (Norway) Heart Disease Studies, United Kingdom Heart Disease Prevention Project; North Karelia (Finland) Heart Disease Program. -2.7 - which not only points to AMI and SCD perhaps being more important than generally thought but also to the importance of dietary factors in development of these diseases and of stroke,!/ just as has become apparent elsewhere in the world. In the community studied there has been a decline in the rates of AMI and SCD perhaps in response to changes in community habits as knowledge of risk factors has improved. 10. Atherosclerosis (narrowing due to lesions) of the coronary arteries can provide another indication of the prevalence and severity of heart disease in China. A 1979-82 reviewLo/ of nearly 8,000 autopsies from 25 pathology departments throughout China showed atherosclerosis as follows: Age 31% 40% These rates are higlher at all age groups than data reported from a 1957 study. / Another finding was that the atherosclerosis rate was significantly higher in Beijing and Tianjin than in other regions. This corresponds with the higher prevalence of hypertension and higher CVD mortality rates in these two municipalities. No directly comparable U.S. or OECD data are available but the high overall rate of lesions and the moderate rate of serious lesions implies that Chinese are probably subject to the same pathological processes as in the West. !/' Tao, S. et al, \"Incidence of Acute Myocardial Infarction and Stroke in the Capital Iron and Steel Complex Region of Beijing, China,\" Magnesium:I: 144-150 (1982) and unpublished data from 1986. The Tao study presents incidence and mortality data for 1974-81 (averages) and 1986 which show marked declines in some rates. It is not known to what extent the community has changed its exposure to key risks and 1986 data is too limited to draw firm conclusions. However, if changed risk exposures can be shown to have occurred during this period, the declines would coincide to those observed elsewhere and may indicate the efficacy am3ng Chinese of changed lifestyles in preventing CVD and reducing piemature mortality. O/ See also, \"A Pathological Survey of Atherosclerotic Lesions of Coronary Artery and Aorta in China\", Path.Res.Pract. 180, 457-462 (1985). This rtview finds the expected characteristics of atherosclerosis in China to be much as in the West -1) there is a direct relationship with age and the prevalence is markedly higher in males than females. The study also showed that lesions of the same severity occurred 10 years earlier in northern China than in the south, pointing to diet and hypertension as explanatory factors. l/ Wang De-Xiu, Hu Zheng-Xiang: Atherosclerosis in 885 autopsies. National Medical Journal of China: 43:411, 1957. -2.8 - 11. Given that China's heavy smoking history and dietary changes toward increased consumption of fats have only a limited history, it raises the possibility that atherosclerotic effects may become much worse over the next decade or so. Changes in this direction now visible in urban populations are possible precursors of epidemic-like national changes which could occur. This suggests an area of epidemiologic research which should have high priority in China. A Visual Presentation of CVD Burden 12. Annex Charts 2.3 through 2.5 for the CVDs and 2.6 (Rheumatic Heart Disease) and 2.7 (Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease) in the following section, convey the importance of these diseases in terms of total mortalitv burden for the different age groups and for urban and rural men and women. Total numbers of deaths by age group are shown as the best indicator of the seriousness of the diseases. Total deaths reflect two factors -the death rates for the age groups (rates are generally much higher for older ages) and the size of the age group. Larger, younger age cohorts are adversely affected in terms of absolute numbers of deaths even though their death rates are much lower. These charts provide some visual indication of where and on whom the burdens fall most heavily because of differences in population numbers, risk exposure, medical care quality and access thereto. Priorities emerge from these charts. 13. In general, while the total numbers of deaths are highest in the oldest age groups (65-74 and beyond) the relative impact on society of the chronic diseases is most severe for the middle aged. The deaths occurring among this group are high already and will increase even further as the larger age cohorts now under age 25 grow older. It is these middle aged persons who in an economic sense should have first claim on prevention and treatment services to reduce their risk of premature illness and death from preventable, chronic diseases. Their disease presents the most burden for society and the greatest financial loss. The charts also indicate the effects of important difference between urban and rural dwellers, and men and women in the same age groups in their risk exposure and access to care. These differences can help China to define priorities for future investments in prevention programs, health facilities, manpower and improvements in health financing systems. Time series data of this kind will be particularly valuable for China to develop. 14. Stroke is by far the most important CVD in terms of numbers of deaths - about a million annually (Annex Chart 2.3). Among the elderly (65-74), rural dwellers (both men and women) are most affected in terms of absolute numbers of deaths (about 186,000 annually).

While the shares of infarctive and hemorrhagic stroke!/ are not known, the high rate of stroke for all groups appears to be directly related to hypertension prevalence (and perhaps to a lesser extent to atherosclerosis) and is indicative of lack of an awareness among the population of hypertension risk generally and inadequate case management of identified hypertensives by the public and health workers alike. Public knowledge of the risk factors leading to stroke and hyperter-' in is still poor; the ability of the health system to provide effective t.eatment and case management is still weak. 5.!/ In the U.S. and most of Europt* infaretive stroke predominates and is linked to both hypertension and atherosclerotic disease (resulting from smoking, high blood cholesterol levels and consequent arterial plaque accumulation). In China, hemorrhagic stroke (more affected by hypertension) is reported to account for about 70% of cases in Tianjin (private communication from Tianjin Health Bureau). If true for China as a whole, this would discount the importance of atherosclerotic disease and its risk factors for the present. It raises the possibility however that with increased exposure to atherosclerotic risk factors that infarctive stroke rates in China may increase in the future, thus negating gains made through prevention of hemorrhagic stroke by reduction in hypertension prevalence. -2.10 - 15. Stroke morbidity is estimated to be about three times as high as the numbers of deaths2/ (about 1.6 million strokes may have occurred in 1986). These represent an enormous cost to China in human and financial terms. Hospital practices which emphasize long periods of stay for stroke patients do not reflect modern practice and given the large numbers of stroke patients help to explain part of the strong pressures for more hospital beds at every level. The relative absence of community-based therapy for rehabilitation of stroke patients implies slower overall recovery rates, longer absences from work, and higher overall hospital costs. As China's population profile continues to age the high rates of stroke will pose a major challenge for the health care system to adopt new practices, and more community- and family- based rehabilitative care of patients. This may pose a difficult problem given the prospects for several generations of single child families (one married couple with social obligations to four elderly parents). More effective control of hypertension as a means of reduction of stroke should be a major public health focus for the next several decades. Given the much lower rates of stroke now prevailing in the West and the success in sharply reducing those rates over the last two decades there is good prospect for the importance of stroke in China to be sharply reduced. Research to define and adapt appropriate intervention methods for China should be the subject of large scale randomized trials and other field studies over the next few years. 16. Hvpertensive Heart Disease (Annex Chart 2.4) presents a smaller but important health burden for China today. Urban/rural difference imply that those who can obtain access to effective therapy for hypertension are much less likely to suffer mortality and serious morbidity from hypertensive heart disease. It is therefore unlikely to increase relative to demographic changes in the future for the same reasons that stroke incidence should begin to stabilize and then decline as programs to control hypertension are implemented. Hypertensive heart disease is preventable, and even reversible when treated. Recent evidence suggests that hypertrophy of the heart will regress if blood pressure is lowered. 17. The impact of coronary heart disease on males, and on urban males in particular (Annex Chart 2.5) is dramatic. A total of 115,000 deaths from CHD may have occurred in China in 1986. As exposure to the risk factors increases and especially as this exposure diffuses further to rural areas the prospect of rapidly growing CHD mortality and morbidity rates implies heavier and expensive burdens on the health system. Morbidity from CHD (non-fatal heart attacks) are known to be about 2.5 times mortality in Chinese populations which have been studied.L./ Morbidity from a growing CHD caseload over the L/ Based on case fatality rates reported in the Sino-Monica Study and the Beijing Iron and Steel Study. L4/ Ibid. In the U.S. about 40% of coronary artery disease patients present as MI, 20% as sudden death, and 40% as angina. Good quality data for similar disaggregation by type of coronary artery disease is not yet available and this would be a valuable area for further epidemiological research to establish a credible, longitudinal data series for China. -2.11 - Annex Chart 2.4 Hypertensive Heart Dis.

In the West modern treatment practices for coronary heart disease is extraordinarily expensive. Among the costs are medications, cardiac catheterization, cardiac surgery, and the acute care of myocardial infarction. These practices are diffusing rapidly in China and have drawn public budgetary support. It remains unclear whether, in general, major differences in mortality accrue if intensive care treatment is avoided. There are now reasonable algorithms for identifying patients who do no benefit appreciably from Intensive Care Units. Applied on a national basis, these algorithms potentially offer substantial economic savings. The most recent findings in the West have shown that very simple, inexpensive and timely steps can often make a dramatic difference in mortality. For example, administration of aspirin shortly after the onset of acute MI prevents 25% of death. -2.12 - AmxChart 2.5 Coronary Heart Disease Deaths & Rates by Age Group, Sex and Location, 1986 Deeth1 in thousands Rate& per 100,000 25 - -50 1 Urban male Ocaths Q Urtan Female Deaths Soo 20 -_ i Rates -200 data, 1086 Cardiovascular Disease Risk Factors In Chtns 18. The major known risk factors for ischemic heart disease include smoking, a diet high in saturated fats (which contributes to atherosclerosis), hypertension, a sedentary lifestyle, diabetes, excessive alcohol consumption and perhaps, excessive salt consumption and obesity (which may contribute to some cases of hypertension!/). 19. Known risk factors for stroke include hypertension (and related dietary factors of \"over nutrition' and obesity), atherosclerotic disease (smoking and diet related) and aneurysm. Prevention and control of hypertension has a direct beneficial effect on the prevention of hypertensive heart disease and to its effective case management. 20. These risk factors are all suitable for policy interventions to cause long-term, population-wide reductions in exposure to decrease the incidence of new cardiovascular disease. This can include regulatory approaches (e.g. limiting and discouraging salt and saturated fat content in manufactured foods and breads), community programs of education and health promotion, and individually-based programs of counseling and lifestyle chlanges. By far the most important risk factor to reduce chronic disease prevalence, and the one 5/ Hypertension complicates and accelerates atherosclerosis. 2.13 - most amenable to governmental policy intervention, is smoking. Issues surrounding smoking control in China and a discussion of strategies which have proven effective elsewhere are presented in Annex Chapter 5. 21. Leading Chinese scientists have been concerned about these risk factors for some years. Dietary surveys and analyses have been key areas of cardiovascular risk studies for China. Excessive salt intake and its relationship to high blood pressure in north and northeastern China and in some minority areas, is the subject of a number of research efforts. Relative shortages of protein intake and excessive saturated fat intake are the subject of other studies. Results in these are unlikely to differ markedly from the recent, well-documented findings in the West which link cholesterol and CHD.t/ The high and growing prevalence of smoking presents a problem which may not yet be widely enough recognized in China. Moreover, there is a known synergistic effect among all of these rink factors resulting in a much higher risk of cardiovascular disease. 22. For example. for each 1% increase in blood cholesterol, the risk of CHD death increases by about 3%. Smokers who have elevated cholesterol levels not only roughly double their age-specific CHD risk but double the risk attributable to cholesterol. The total risk roughly doubles again for individuals with a sedentary life style. Hypertension also roughly doubles the relative risk for those who are exposed to any other risk factor or combination of risk factors. The future implications of this may be substantial in China, especially since CHD death rates, while increasing, remain relatively low in comparison to stroke and other causes of death, but with many Chinese now exposed to multiple risk factors. 23. Moreover, it is very unlikely that China has neared the peak of its CVD mortality rates. Studies of migrant Chinese populations, of selected populations in China and of non-Chinese in many other countries all point to CVD as growing rapidly to much higher levels than now experienced in China once populations are exposed to the most important risk factors. China already has widespread, serious problems with hypertension as shown by the unusually high rates of stroke. For example, the ratio of stroke mortality rate to coronary heart disease mortality rate in China is about 4:1 rather than the 1:3 ratio exhibited in the U.S.L7/ This has drawn much more attention in China to the problem of stroke rather than to other C-VD events. However, as China's diet changes and as the duration and dosage of China's smoking experience increases, most knowledgeable observers agree that other CVD incidence and mortality rates will increase, perhaps dramatically. The history of heavy smoking with age of initiation in teenage years or early twenties is still limited, and the dose (length)/response relationship of C'D to smoking is known to be highly positive. Dietary changes are comparatively D!/ Tung et al, op sit, p. 173, 174. LI In urban areas the ratio is 3:1 in favor of stroke and in rural areas, 6:1 (Annex Table 2.1). In the Beijing Iron and Steel Complex Study, which may represent an epidemiologically more mature population such as all of China will have in 15 years, the ratio is closer to 1:1. -2.14 - to smoking is known to be highly positive. Dietary changes are comparatively recent in China and diets higher in saturated fats are still limited mainly to urban populations, and among those, fGr only a few years. This offers China the opportunity to emphasize a preventive approach aggressive enough to avoid at least a major portion of its otherwise predictable high burden of CVD.L!/ It may be able to enter earlier a phase of control and declining CVD rates as has happened in some countries in the West. Rheumatic Heart Disease 24. Direct physical damage (scarring and weakening) of heart valves and muscle tissues can be caused by infection of the throat (usually the oropharynx) from streptococcus bacteria. Infection with strains of type-A beta-hemolytic streptococcus causes immune reaction which results in later and slowly progressive damage to heart valves and other parts of the heart. As years go by, this may result in narrowing of valve openings and/or abnormal valvular leakage. This can result in general and severe debilitation of circulatory function and lead to early heart failure and as well as susceptibility to other diseases. 25. The only significant risk factor for rheumatic heart disease is the poorly managed treatment of streptococcal infections of the throat among children and young adults. Rheumatic fever end rheumatic heart disease has already virtually disappeared in the West and new cases of rheumatic heart disease are becoming rare in China. 26. Widespread use of low-cost, low-risk penicillin at both the urban and rural primary care levels has greatly reduced the incidence of streptococcal infections and the occurrence of rheumatic fever.L9/ Teaching hospitals now report difficulty in finding patients with acute rheumatic fever. With 18/ As most societies develop economically there is also a tendency for physical activity levels to decline for many people. Sedentary life style is a known major risk factor for CVD but it remains very unclear how this may affect China. Today, even in the urban areas China remains a relatively active society and regular exercise is likely to im-prove cardiovascular fitness. While most studies of this subject have had a difficult time separating the associated benefits of lower smoking prevalence, lower weight, lower cholesterol, lower blood pressure, etc., most primary prevention programs can effectively emphasize exercise because of its probable benefits. D9 There are also risks accompanying the more widespread use of some of the newer, wide spectrum antibiotics in China. In general, however, the problem at the primary care level with the widespread use of new generation, broad-spectrum antibiotics, often in combination with each other, is that Chinese may experience widespretd allergic and other side effects ranging from deafness to death and the emergence of virulent new oacterial forms with resistance to a wide range of antibiotics. The risks of penicillin for treatment oL rheumatic fever are very, very small for tihese cumul.ative side effects. -2.15 - continued management of streptococcal infection through antibiotic treatment, rheumatic fever can be considered a disease of the past for many areas of China. The problem for the next 3-4 decades will be the effective case management and therapy for those vho have damaged heart valves. The obstruction or leakage of valves can usually be repaired surgically with good results in terms of health and productivity. Annex Chart 2.6 shows that rheumatic heart disease is predominantly health a burden for women and for persons over age 65 today. The overall burden of rheumatic heart disease can be expected to lessen as there will be fewer from the younger age cohorts who have been subjected to rheumatic infections. In some regions of the country this will not be true however and this disease still deserves to be a priority for attention in the medical care given to younger age groups, and especially girls. 27. Total mortality from rheumatic heart disease may have been about 50,000 in 1986. Morbidity is far higher (perhaps 20 times) but no reliable data from which to infer incidence are available. The relatively higher burden among rural Chinese and women (Annex Chart 2.6) is almost surely a reflection of past inequalities in access to care and past differences in living standards. The high death rates for women may also reflect in part their more limited access to care today, in that they may be less likely to be insured than men and there may be social or other biases discouraging their ready access to care. The markedly lower number of deaths (in relation to mortality rates) among urban residents probably is a good measure of the care differences.

Treatment with a 5-7 day regime of penicillin is both easy and quite safe. Where laboratory services are available to distinguish patients who have strep and need penicillin these should be used. New, simple diagnostic tests for strep may allow rapid diagnosis of strep at the primary care level in the future. Training for health workers in the recognition and treatment of streptococcal infections, and in the proper referral of rheumatic heart disease cases which may benefit from surgery will provide China with clear programs of primary and secondary prevention which have been shown to be effective. Peripheral Vascular Disease 29. Narrowing of both major and minor blood vessels in many parts of the body (macro- and micro-peripheral vascular disease) can result in serious damage to vital organs such as brain, heart, kidneys and eyes and lead to deterioration of skin with ulcers and gangrene of lower limbs from injuries not felt or cared for because of damage to nerves. 30. Major risk factors are diabetes, smoking, \"over nutrition\" (high blood cholesterol levels), and hypertension. All are amenable to intervention programs (as mentioned above and in Annex Chapter 3, Risk Factors). While vascular disease is not ar apparent, serious probli-m in China today, this situation may change over the next decade, from demographic effects, increasing incidence of diabetes and from the longer experience which the population will by then have had with the major risk factors of smoking and higher fat diet.10/ Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease (and Cor Pulmonale) 31. Chronic obstructive lung (pulmonary) disease refers to several disease manifestations and is known by many names -cor pulmonale (often used in China to refer to heart disease with an underlying pulmonary deficiency), right- sided heart disease, chronic bronchitis and emphysema, and obstructive respiratory of unknown origin, are among the most common. All of these disease names refer to one or another of the pathological manifestations of Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease (COPD). The various names given to it indicate the complexity of disease progression and the bodily functions it affects. 32. COPD is a chronic, progressive, insidious disease that is severely debilitating and fatal in serious cases. Its early manifestation, chronic bronchitis, involves inflammation and narrowing of the bronchial passageways to the lung and is often accompanied by severe coughing caused by the hyper- secretion of mucus in the inflamed passages. The cough sounds terrible, is Lo/ Peripheral Vascular Disease mortality and morbidity is not included in the projection model at this time. Data are too fragmentary and the future course of this disease is too unclear for this to be done. As better epidemiological and clinical information becomes axvailable, China may wish to include this disease in a refined version of the model. -2.17 - discomfiting to the patient and disturbing to those around him, but in itself is seldom seriously disabling and is not normally a fatal condition providing there is good access to medical care. Untreated disease frequently progresses to a stage where it is diagnosed as emphysema. 33. Emphysema is the progressive destruction of lung tissuAs (the alveolar walls) and hence the lungs' ability to exchange carbon dioxide for new oxygen in the blood supply as it passes through the lungs enroute to the heart for recirculation. The lungs have a large ventilatory reserve however and diminished function often does not become clinically apparent until it has reached an advanced stage. The silent, progressive nature of this deterioration means that it may long go undetected and thus not be recognized as a serious health problem. Many patients with clinically disabling COPD die with the disease as an underlying cause, rather than directly because of ventilatory failure. Death certificates may or may not list COPD as an underlying cause. Mortality data generally under represent the burden of COPD. 34. In the patient with COPD the right side of the heart can become enlarged in a struggle to increase the supply of oxygenated blood. Severe enlargement can contribute to overall disability and eventually to failure of the heart itself. COPD in its various manifestations can contribute to the severity and eventual outcome of other cardiovascular disease including coronary and rheumatic heart disease. Morbid.ty of COPD in an individual is usually a combination of mucus hypersecretion, airway narrowing, and emphysema. The extent of damage represented by each of these three processes can vary substantially from individual to individual, both in absolute magnitude and the proportional contribution of each component. 35. International Experience. COPD has been a major disease category in the industrialized world for many years. It now accounts for about 60,000 deaths in the U.S. annually of which 80% can be considered as preventable and premature. In China there are about 850,000 such deaths annually. COPD morbidity has a severe impact as it usually occurs over an extended period. COPD is more prevalent in males than females in the industrialized countries, and mortality from it in many countries may have been undergoing a long term increase. The progressive deterioration of lung function from COPD so severely limits the activities of affected individuals that inactivity attributable to it exceeds that reported for any other major disease category in the U.S. 36. Etiology and Risk Factors. Cigarette smoking is the most important proven risk factor for COPD. / Scientists from a variety of disciplines have investigated the role of cigarette smoking in the development of COPD. The progressive decline of lung function can be linked with increasing smoke exposure. In many countries both COPD prevalence and COPD death are limited largely to smokers. The mechanism by which cigarette smoking can lead to the destruction of the alveolar and the development of emphysema is broadly 5/ \"Cigarette smoking is responsible for of chronic bronchitis and emphysema.\" WHO/EB77/22 Add.l -2.18 - understood. While some gaps in the understanding of the details of this process may still exist, experimental and epidemiologic evidence leaves no room for reasonable doubt that cigarette smoking is the fundamental cause of COPD in the West. 37. The natural process of aging also results in a steacy, gradual decline of lung function. In the absence of other risks or illnesses this effect is subclinical. Emigrant studies suggest that ethnic background is not a major determinant for mortality risk due to COPD. 38. In many countries considerable attention has been paid to the role of air pollution in chronic lung illness. Results of studies appear to support the notion that persons with established COPD can be adversely affected by environmental pollution. It may also be that some repeated severe episodes of acute bronchitis and other respiratory infections during childhood, perhaps aggravated by severely polluted air (either in homes from micro-environmental causes such as stoves, or macro-environmental, outside air pollution) may contribute to development of COPD. There are yet few epidemiologic data to support this or the conclusion that general environmental pollution is a major risk factor for COPD. Nor can COPD rates in China be clearly linked to acute childhood infections and, in general, attempts in a number of studies in various countries to link environmental pollution with prevalence of COPD have not been successful. 39. For certain groups, for example workers exposed to silica, beryllium, asbestos, talc and other dusts and to pneumoconiosis, the development of COPD may pose an additional risk factor for premature death from a combination of chronic lung diseases. These groups may present foci of prevention programs for industrial and public health work but reduction of these hazards should mainly be considered as occupational disease risk reduction and should not be undertaken as primary COPD prevention activities. 40. COPD in China. Statistics on mortality and morbidity attributable to COPD in China are very difficult to obtain and interpret._/ Cor pulmonale is frequently listed on death certificates as a primary cause for elderly Chinese. It would then be classified as heart disease in amalgamation of statistics. Reporting of chronic bronchitis and emphysema deaths, and of other respiratory deaths, also takes place. There is no feasible way to sort out which of these deaths are primarily due to COPD in one of its manifestations and which are heart or ventilatory failure deaths related to other causes. Most Chinese experts agree however that the vast majority of L/ This has also been true in other countries. In 1975 a joint committee of the American College of Chest Physicians and the American Thoracic Society developed standardized definitions of these conditions that may improve the accuracy of morbidity and mortality statistics in the future. However, controversy remains over the appropriate tests to use in diagnosis and the appropriate cut-off points for classifying patients. There is general agreement that FEV-1 -the amount of air that can be forced out of the lungs in 1 second -is a reasonable gross indicator of the degree of impairment. -2.19 - these deaths result from one or more of the manifestations of COPD, and that many more deaths with COPD as an underlying cause occur but are not reported as such. HOPH data series do not separate COPD mortality in a way that allows even rough historical trends to be discerned. The 1986 DSP data clearly show that COPD (as Cor Pulmonale) is the most serious of the heart disease categor- ies afflicting China (Annex Table 2.1 and Annex Chart 2.7). The mortality rate is 84/100,000 (i.e.about 850,000 deaths each year), with rural areas having a 50% higher rate that urban areas. It kills men and women about equally. Annex Chart 2.7 shows that it is not only the very old, but also the middle aged vho suffer from COPD in China. As in most other countries, there are no meaningful indicators of incidence, only a variety of anecdotal impressions from physicians and hospital administrators. 41. In China it is very likely that smoking, of both traditional tobacco forms and of cigarettes, plus exposure to severe indoor air pollution and chronic respiratory infections in childhood, and perhaps poor nutritional and socio-econom,c status, explain the high rates of COPD. Soundly designed epidemiologic studies to demonstrate the relative role of these factors do not Annex Chart 2.7 China: COPD Deaths and Rates by Age Group, Sex and Location, 1986 Deaths in Thousends Rates per 100,000 120 -1000 MM Urban Mole Deaths E Urban Female Deaths 100 Rural Male Deaths 800 1I Rural Female Deaths Urban Male Rates 80 *~Urban Female Rates -Rural Male Rates -2.20 - exist however. The troublesome aspect for the future is not the currently high rates of COPD mortality. Future reductions in COPD prevalence could rationally be expected as respiratory infections decline with success of general economic development and as severe indoor air pollution drops with a switch to different cooking and heating fuels or better outside ventilation of smoke from existing fuels. However, the fact that exposure to manufactured cigarettes is a relatively recent phenomenon means that there will almost certainly be offsetting or further increases in the prevalence of COPD as the effect of smoking begins to become evident. In other countries smoking of manufactured cigarettes has been clearly demonstrated as the primary risk factor for COPD. / The experimentation that would be needed to develop more conclusive Chins-specific evidence to link smoking and COPD would not be difficult.L./ This in turn will allow for a more rapid development of a strategy in China for prevention of COPD. / 5/ In a study of U.S. veterans, smokers of two or more packs per day had 22 times the risk of death from COPD than did nonsmokers. In British and Japanese studies, women smokers at the highest levels experienced a 32- and an 11-fold higher risk for death from COPD (respectively) than their non-smoking counterparts. Studies among smoking British doctors of COLD deaths and inhalation practices showed a 1.5 fold higher risk for those who were deep inhalers and all smokers, regardless of inhalation practices experienced higher rates of COPD deaths than nonsmokers. Other studies show that ethnic origin plays a minor role if any, in determining COPD risk and that regardless of country of origin, smokers experience higher COPD mortality rates than nonsmokers. Populations with low smoking rates experience markedly lower rates of chronic respiratory infection and of COPD. (The Health Consequences of Smoking, A Report of the Surgeon General, U.S. Department of health and Human Services, 1984, 207-213.) 5./ With funding from IDA Credit 1472-CHA, Rural Health and Medical Education Project, a large scale survey by CAPN of smoking habits and disease among middle-aged Chinese is underway and should yield early insight into this question by 1992. 5/ It should be noted that while virtually every smoker develops signs of bronchial airways narrowing and irritation, not every smoker develops signs of the emphysema aspects of COPD, or even minor clinical manifestations of it. However, both COPD prevalence and COPD deatlh are limited largely to smokers in the West. Some smokers have a far more rapid decline in lung function than others for reasons which are not yet clear. There is not yet any link between these declines and the likelihood of developing severe COPD but it suggests another area for research as early declines in lung function may help to mark individuals who are at greater risk of developing COPD. Given the many other harmful effects of smoking, any research efforts along these lines should not be seen as a substitute for, or reason to delay aggressive programs of smoking cessation and prevention. -2.21 - 42. Prospects for Future Epidemiology of COPD in China. Because death from COPD is the end result of lung damage accumulated over many years, COPD deaths would be expected to occur in greater proportion in the older age groups. Single, age-averaged death rates (such as U.S. or Chinese crude total rates) will not therefore reflect a true picture of the changes in this disease over time. Annex Chart 2.8 shows the age-specific death rates for white males and females in the U.S. int 1960, 1968, 1977, 1985 and for Chinese men and women in 1986 for COPD. Death rates increase rapidly over the age of 45 and are very high over age 65. 43. China's morrality rates for COPD cannot yet reflect experience with prevalence and duration of smoking cigarettes (see Annex Chapter 3, Risk Factors). Another ten years of smoking experience in China may yield death rates higher than current levels as has happened in the in the U.S. and other countries. Prospects for China appear particularly worrisome because as reductions occur in COPD death rates from non-smoking causes, increased smoking attributable rates may wipeout any overall improvement which otherwise would occur. 44. Prevalence of COPD deserves special attention in developing a strategy. Morbidity is many fold higher than mortality -perhaps 10 times or so -and is characterized by prolonged periods of disability with intermittent hospital treatment. If incidence and prevalence are on the increase in China, as seems likely given smoking experience, it implies that the economic burden of COPD for China is enormous, i.e. perhaps 8-10 million patients, each pyartially disabled, more prone to other illnesses, requiring increasingly frequent and costly treatment as they age. Well designed surveys to establish and track COPD incidence and prevalence should have high priority for China's universities and research institutes. 45. Prospects for COPD in China. Overall, COPD is already a major killer and disabler of ChineseL/ and it can be expected to become even more so by the end of this century. In combination with other chronic diseases, the burden of care of the aged with emphysema will be heavy and the quality of life for those affected will be poor. There are no known effective treatments or cures for COPD. Deterioration of lung function is progressive and irrever- sible. 46. On the positi e side, cessation of smoking and minimizing other environmental insults have a quick and salutary effect on stopping further airway damage and lung deterioration. If cessation occurs at a stage when only airways irritation and narrowing have occurred there is some evidence that substantial function can be restored after a number of years. Cessation L6/ It is not only the elderly whose respiratory function is injured by cigarette smoke. It is well documented in the West that children of smoking parents have an increased prevalence of reported respiratory symptoms and an increased frequency cf bronchitis and pneumonia early in life. There are no comparable data for China but this is another area where quick and well-designed studies could make substantial and valuable contributions. -2.22 - Annex Chart 2.8 Age-Specific Mortality Rates for COPD China and the United States Males Rates per 100Q000 800 600.-/ Males -u.s. 1960 400 u.s.

This calls for smoking cessation efforts to be aimed at the young and middle aged. Physician- and community-based intervention programs of all kinds to reduce the incidence of smoking offer the best hope of primary prevention. Because COPD is directly related to the length of smoking experience, prevention of smoking in the young is particularly important. Further, COPD is dose responsive. As it is well known that smokers who begin at an early age tend to be heavier, lifelong smokers, this is an additional inducement to focus smoking prevention measures on them. For those who already are smokers, active smoking cessation programs in the workplace and in the community offer the best hope. Counseling by physicians at every health contact opportunity can be expected to influence some significant percentage of the population. For those who are irretrievably addicted to the nicotine in tobacco, it should be noted that there is no evidence that low tar cigarettes provide any escape from the lung and airways damages caused by smoking. However, because of the silent, progressive nature of the disease it may be difficult to convince physician and patient alike of the need for timely and concarted action to stop smoking. As in most countries, it will likely prove difficult to convince the young to be concerned about eventual, premature mortality from COPD. All of these factors imply the need for strong and sustained leadership and public funding for this health issue. Cancer in China 47. Cancers are among the most serious of the chronic diseases in China and account for a large share of mortality and underlying morbidity (refer to Annex Chapter 1, Annex Char.s 1.1, 1.2 and 1.4). The burden of cancer has long been recognized and a nationwide survey during 1973-75 documented the types, mortality rates and geographic distribution of the most common cancers. These are summarized in Annex Table 2.2, this annex. The five leading cancers at that time were in rank order stomach, esophagus, liver, lung and colo- rectal for men, and stomach, cervix, esophagus, liver and lung for women. Until now at least, China appears to have low rates of breast cancer. Data from the DSP system, summarized in the table below, indicate the continued importance of cancer and may reflect some shift in rank orders and some changes in mortality rates. For men the leading five cancers by rank order are now lung, stomach, liver, esophagus and colo-rectal; for women the rank order is lung, stomach, liver, esophagus and cervix. Annex Table 2.3 presents detailed age, sex and location specific mortality rates from the DSP system. In general urban Chinese are about 50% more likely to die of cancer than their rural counterparts and men are about 50% more at risk than women regardless of location. The higher urban rates are indicative of the increased future risk of newly urbanized chinese and the overall problems that China will face as industrialization and urbanization continues (see table below). -2.24 - China: Mortality Rates of Leading Cancers, DSP 1986 (per 100,000) Location (--------Urba ------ ) (--------Rural---) (---------Tota ------) of Cancer Malo X Femaml X Male S Female X Male X Female Z Esophagus 15.0 10 6.2 7 14.0 15 7.9 13 14.5 12 6.9 9 Stomach 25.7 17 11.6 13 30.0 32 14.1 23 27.6 22 12.7 16 Colorectal 8.1 5 8.3 9 3.7 4 4.2 7 6.2 5 6.6 8 Liver 28.4 19 9.6 10 17.6 19 7.9 13 23.7 19 8.9 11 Lung 40.9 27 23.6 26 13.7 15 6.4 11 29.9 23 16.4 21 Cervix 0.0 0 10.5 6 0.0 0 9.7 a 0.0 0 10.1 6 48. The sections below discuss prospective epidemiology, risk factors, international trends, and strategy for China for the leading cancers. Stomach Cancer 49. Tumors of the stomach have been a leading cause of cancer mortality throughout the world for many years. Stomach cancer mortality varies widely from region to region within and among countries. However, in most countries stomach cancer has been undergoing a long-term decline for reasons which are only partly understood.27 The causes and rates of this decline may give an indication of what may be ahead for stomach cancer in China. 50. Both benign and malignant stomach tumors arise from the stomach lining and, less commonly from the muscles, nerves and lymphoid tissue of the stomach wall. Not all stomach cancers are histologically homogeneous. Two rough categories covering about 80% of all gastric cancers have provided useful distinctions over the last 35 years -diffuse and intestinal.!! Epidemiologic research using these two categories has shown that across many cultures and countries intestinal type gastric cancer is more prevalent in males and in older age groups. It displays what epidemiologists characterize as \"epidemic behavior\", varying widely in frequency by time and place and thus 5/ Caution is needed in comparing stomach cancer incidence rates from different countries, because of possible differences in diagnostic methods, criteria for determining malignancy, and other medical care practices. However, the overall information and conclusions presented below are probably not misleading in their pointing to the general direction of a decline in stomach cancer mortality internationally, and for China. The rates of decline, the time of its onset and the eventual base levels which may be reached are of course speculative and open to discussion. !!/ Jarvi and Lauren, \"On the role of heterotopias of the intestinal epithelium - appears to be more governed by environmental (rather than genetic) factors. Diffuse gastric cancer is nore evenly prevalent in both men and women and it has relatively similar frequency in both high and low risk stomach cancer regions. It shows a clear predilection for younger individuals, is associated with type A blood group and thus appears to be more governed by host related (i.e genetic) factors than by environmental factors. 51. Trends and International Experience. The long term decline of stomach cancer mortality in the United States represents the most dramatic change for the better in U.S. cancer statistics (Annex Chart 2.9). It is not an isolated event. Epidemiological patterns in many countries have displayed similar, even more dramatic declines in stomach cancer mortality rates. In general, countries with the highest rates of gastric cancer, such as Japan, Chile and Finland, have experienced a decline which is both steeper and later than that of countries with lower overall stomach cancer mortality.

Source: Notional Center for Heofth Statistics and U.S. Bureau of the Cencus. -2.26 - studies9/ in different countries have indicated that much of unusually high mortality rates of stomach cancer are accounted for by the intestinal type. Further studies of both migrant populations and of the gradual worldwide decline in gastric cancer incidence have also shown that much of the declineis due to the decreasing rate of intestinal type cancer. These findings suggest that intestinal and diffuse type gastric cancers are different diseases, each with its own set of risk factors and with different future prospects. The general decline, especially in countries which had very high rates, suggests further that the major etiologic influences of stomach cancer are environmental rather than genetic. The widespread international decline is not explainable by improvements in early detection and medical management. Prognosis for all but the earliest stages of disease has remained one of the poorest of all cancers with five -;ear survival rates in the U.S. of only 16 percent. L 52. Risk factors for stomach cancer present a complex and confusing picture about which too little is yet understood. There is a general consensus that exposure to risk factors at an early age are particularly important. Declining incidence of stomach cancer in successive birth cohorts in several countries underpin this and suggest that in countries where children are today not so exposed to major risk factors there will be successive and dramatic declines in stomach cancer incidence several decades later. 53. Suspected major risk factors include smoking!!/, high carbohydrate intake, high consumption of nitrates and nitrites (used in food preservation) and of dietary salt, low consumption of fresh fruits and vegetables and vitamins C, E, and A, and low availability of refrigeration which has an impact on the composition of the diet, the methods of food preservation and the frequency of acute gastritis due to consumption of partially spoiled foods. While the links cannot yet be conclusively demonstrated, changes in these environmental factors seem to be closely associated with the worldwide decline in gastric cancer incidence. Risk factors for diffuse type gastric cancer are less clear and its relatively even prevalence and distribution have pointed research in the direction of genetic predisposition of those affected. Diffuse gastric cancer is not experiencing definable long term declines. Data are not yet available, however, which would allow definition of an average base rate of this cancer type. 54. Stomach Cancer in China: Stomach cancer has long been the leading cause of cancer mortality in China, accounting for 26% in males and 18.7% in females L9/ Much of this section on gastric cancer draws heavily on the cross- national studies and comparisons which have been summarized by Howson, Hiyama and Wynder, \"The decline in gastric cancer: epidemiology of an unplanned triumph,\" Epidemiologic Review, Vol. 8, 1986. L/ \"Ca' -A Cancer Journal for Clinicians, American Cancer Society, January, 1987, Vol. 37, No. 1, p. 3.

Epidemiologically, stomach cancer in China displays similar patterns to those found in other countries -a clear north-south gradient with the higher incidence in the north being probably the result of environmental/ dietary influences; a predominance of mortality in males (roughly a 2:1 sex ratio in most age groups over 35); and much higher mortality rates among the middle aged and elderly. These characteristics would support a hypothesis that most gastric cancers in China, as elsewhere in the world, are of the intestinal type. If so, then China could be expected to experience similar and dramatic declines in incidence of this cancer over comingt decades.L4/ 56. Despite possible indications of declining in importance, stomach cancer remains a subject of major public and medical concern in China. It severely affects the current leadership generation. Considerable clinical and field research is devoted to the subject. Experimentation with different surgical techniques is aggressively underway and account for an expensive and relatively significant part of higher level hospital workload. Costing studies in China have shown that the unit costs of caring for gastric cancer patients ranks among the top three leading chronic disease care costs. 57. Success in treatment, in terms of survival rates, remains low as it does everywhere. Faced with the prospect of a rapidly aging populat!on with a lessening capacity for home-based care of the elderly ill, many policymakers in China are rightly worried that coming demographic changesL/ will increase 2z/ On the other hand, China would rank only 10th out of 47 countries for which data is available in terms of the overall importance of stomach cancer mortality. (1973-75 Survey, age adjusted to 1964 China population, males 32.4/100,000; females 15.9/100,000; 47 country data are age adjusted to 1980. Among these countries, China's rates would rank -males, 8th; females, 10th). L/ These data disguise the high regional variability of the mortality rates from stomach cancer in China. For example, provincial average mortality rates vary as much as 5 fold; county variations are even greater with lows ranging from about 7/100,000 to highs of 113/100,000. Regional variations occur in most countries but China's are particularly dramatic, and may indicate the importance of specific envirormental factors. L4/ There is no specific information is available on the approximate prevalence of the different types of gastric cancers (intestinal or diffuse) in China. This is an area where further epidemiological/ clinical investigation would aid policy makers in their assessment of the likely future course of gastric cancer. 5/ It may well be that for several decades ahead those age cohorts now in their forties and fifties will suffer even higher rates of stomach cancer mortality when they reach their late sixties and seventies. -2-, , the burden of illness due to stomach cancer, present:ing both social and financial problems. A number of institutions are thus devoting considerable research to a developing an effective clinical treatment and cure. 58. Strategy for Prevention and Management. Considerable further study is needed of the specific types and incidence of gastric cancers in China. Such research as is available fully corresponds to the international findings and experience reviewed above.6/ 59. Primary Prevention. Further basic research into the etiology of the diseases would be required before specific primary prevention strategies -.ould be formulated and risk groups targeted in a cost effective manner. At the same time some attention should be given to establishing cohort studies so that in 10-20 years epidemiologic trend and correlative data will be emerging. Present knowledge suggests that intestinal type gastric cancer is a disease initiated early in life, most likely by exposure and interaction among various carcinogens. It remains unclear at exactly what ages and at which points in the gastric precancerous process the various risk factors may be important. For example, at what stage does a diet high in salted, pickled foods, or high in carbohydrates, influence gastric cancer risk? At what stage do diets high in certain vitamins, or high in certain food types provide a protective effect? 60. Efforts to reduce exposure of the population to strongly suspected risk factors mentioned above (reducing dietary salt intake, nitrates/nitrites and pickled/smoked food consumption) will likely have a good though as yet unpredictable impact. The protective effect of dietary modification also remains uncertain but the moderate changes in the Chinese diet which are already underway with improved economic development (toward more fruits and vegetables, higher consumption of vitamins, and reduced incidence of gastritis with improved refrigeration and food handling) will almost certainly have beneficial effects for a number of the chronic diseases, including stomach cancer. The current generation of children in China may well experience dramatically lower rates of gastric cancer as a result of the high rates of growth and improved living standards which Chinese are now generally enjoying. 61. Effective secondary prevention programs with screening for early detection are also difficult to define. Early efforts in Japan to do large scale screening with fluoroscopy followed by endoscopic examination for suspected positive appeared to yield impressive results with earlier average stages of detection and markedly higher five year survival rates amongst average cases found and treated. However, subsequent concerns about the greater risks posed by excessive exposure to radiation have caused this approach to be terminated. Mass endoscopic screening has been tried in China with only very limited success. It is very expensive and uncomfortable (and thus difficult to ensure participation) and would appear to be an imprac- ticable strategy for China, given the need to do screenings on a regular basis L/ Zhang Ru-Fu, et al, Beijing Institute for Cancer Research \" A comprehensive survey of etiologic factors of stomach cancer in China\"' Chinese Medical Journal, 97(5):322-332, 1984 -2.29 - in order to have a chance of making the detection at an early enough stage for surgery to have a positive effect. Experiments are underway in a number of places in the world with other, less invasive and less expensive types of screening. In the long term, screening by biological or chemical markers may make mass screening (or at least high risk group screening) economical and safe. 62. Further research work to try to establish clear relationships, if any, between gastric ulcers, episodes of acute gastritis, dietary factors, etc., are all topics where China, given its high rates of gastric cancer and the large numbers of persons moving into older age groups can productively do epidemiologic, biological and clinical research with hope of making both a contribution to scientific knowledge and to an eventual breakthrough intervention. 63. Evidence that China is entering what may well be a long term decrease in gastric cancer would allow health authorities to deliberately refocus otherwise expensive clinical research programs away from a problem which would decline in importance on its own and to refocus these resources on some of the predictable but not yet evident dangers which will emerge as more serious cancer problems over the next decades. Lung Cancer 64. Even with the substantial gains in diagnostic capabilities of the last two decadcs, lung cancer remains very difficult to diagnose during the early local stage. Once established lung cancer quickly progresses from the local to regional stages and death follows rapidly. There are four major types of cells that constitute the majority of lung cancers -squamous, small cell, adenocarcinoma and large cell. At the regional stage all four types have uniformly low survival rates (US data, circa 1980), varying only slightly from a one year survival rate of 7% for small cell to 14% for adenocarcinoma. Over all types, both regional and local, the five year survival rate is 7%. 65. The clear causal relationship between smoking and lung cancer mark it for special consideration among the cancers. In Europe and North America the dramatic increase in lung cancer (Annex Chart 2.9) over the last fifty years has made it one of the major causes of death and the leading cause of cancer mortality. The increased death rates have been firmly linked to earlier increases in the adoption of cigarette smoking. Even with early diagnosis there is no effective treatment -the only viable approach is through primary prevention. 66. Lung Cancer in Other Countries. Because of low life expectancies and past low levels of manufactured cigarette consumption, lung cancer has remained relatively unimportant as a cause of death in developing countries in the past, but as infectious diseases are reduced and life expectancy and smoking prevalence increase lung cancer is becoming more important. In Zimbabwe lung cancer accounts for 11% of male cancer deaths, in India for 3% (Bangalore) and 12% (Ahmedabad), in Korea for 13%, in Sri Lanka for 3%, in the -2.30 - Philippines for 20% (Manila), and in Indonesia for 4% (Yogyakarta).LY Age adjusted mortality rates (Segi Wts.)L/ are 5.3 in Thailand and 6.9 in the Philippines and 0.9 in Nigeria (Ibadan, U.S. Wts.). In contrast, in the United States and much of Europe lung cancer accounts for over 35% of male cancer deaths. The age adjusted mortality rate (Segi Wts.) per 100,000 males is 40.8 in Singapore, 19.9 in Japan, 46.9 in Canada, 69.9 in Belgium and 36.8 in France, and 52.2 in the United States. In most countries, the mortality rates for females are substantially less than those for males. The table below provides selected comparative data on lung cancer for both males and females. In most of the developed world the trend in mortality from lung cancer has been upward at an average per cent change per year of about 5% for males and 4% for females.

Lung Cancer and Smoking. All four types of lung cancer neoplasms have been shown to be strongly related to tobacco consumption, with the firmest association linking the small cell and squamous carcinomas and an only slightly weaker association with adenocarcinoma. Numerous and extensive studies have been carried out examining the relative risk of tobacco consumption versus non-consumption and have looked at the difference in relative risk for alternative forms of consumption (cigarettes, pipes, cigar), dose (daily number of cigarettes, tar and nicotine content and method of ingestion), and duration (age started or years of habit). The studies L7/ Selected geographic areas from D. M. Parkin (Ed). Cancer Occurrence in Develoxing Countries, W.H.O., International Agency for Research on Cancer, IARC Scientific Publications No. 75, Lyon (1986). !!I Throughout this section international comparisons of rates are facilitated by references to age standardized rates. Two different standards have had to be used because of complex and differing data sources. These are the standard population series developed by Mitsuo Segi (\"Cancer Mortality and Morbidity Statistics\", GANN Monograph on Cancer Research No. 26) hereafter referred to as \"Segi Wts.\" and the U.S. 1970 census population weights hereafter referred to as \"U.S. Wts.\" -2.31 - overwhelmingly indicate that the relative risk of lung cancer for tobacco users is a multiple of that faced by non-tobacco users. Annex Table 2.4 summarizes a number of studies related to cigarette consumption. In the first part of the table, the studies cited demonstrate that the risk of lung cancer for those who smoke approximately 1 to 10 cigarettes per day is 3 to 5 times greater than for non smokers, for those who smoke up to one pack (20 cigarettes) the relative risk is 7 to 9 and for two packs, 9 to 15. The studies also demonstrate that \"non inhalation\" does not avoid excess risk. Smokers who report that they do not inhale nevertheless run a relative risk of 4 to 8 times that of non smokers. 68. One of the most striking aspects of the link between smoking and cancer is the role of duration which is found to be much more important than dose in determining cancer risk. For example, one sutrvey of the literature summarizes that \"a three fold increase in the daily dose-rate may produce only about a three-fold increase in effect, while a three-fold increase in duration might produce about a 100-fold increase in effect.\"9/ Importantly, the accumulated number of years of smoking will continue to place the former smoker at greater risk of lung cancer than non smokers with the relative risk converging to about one, twenty years after cessation.LO/ The effect of duration of the smoking habit on lung cancer is very significant in assessing the course of cancer in the developed countries over the past and in assessing the course of cancer in developing countries in the future. The current high rates of lung cancer in the developed countries are the result of a history of a high percentage of the population that started smoking at an early age and continued to smoke over several decades. Cultural and social changes in developing countries that are lowering the starting age for smoking and increasing the duration of smoking and the percentage of the population that smokes, will also result in greatly increased rates of lung cancer in the future. 69. Other causes have been identified for lung cancer including various sources of air pollution and industrial hazards. These causes can be significant in selected subsets of the population where exposure is particularly intense. For example workers involved in the manufacture of chromates from chrome ore, plastics (from chloromethyl ethers used in manufacture of ion exchange resins), copper and cobalt (from arsenic content of ore), pesticides, radioactive materials, and asbestos are all in at greater risk of lung cancer than the general population. 5/ R. Peto \"Influence of Dose and Duration of Smoking on Lung Cancer Rates\", in D. G. Zaridze and R. Peto (eds.) Tobacco: A Major International Health Hazard, (IARC Scientific Publication No. 74), Lyon, International Agency for Research on Cancer, 1986. O/ Report of the Surgeon General, The Health Conseguences Of Smoking: CANCER, US Department of Health and Human Services, Public Health Service, Office of Smoking and Health, (1982), p45. -2.32 - 70. Cigarette smoking interacts with environmental cactors to greatly increase the risk of lung cancer. Before the advent of stringent protective measures for asbestos workers in the United States, workers who smoked cigarettes had 5 times the risk of lung cancer compared to smokers who did not work with asbestos and more than 50 times the risk of people who neither smoked nor worked with asbestos.L./ Similarly, the risk for uranium miners, and workers at coke ovens in the steel industry, who smoke cigarettes is 4 times the risk of smokers who are not in those occupations. 71. Several studies have partitioned the total risk of lung cancer between tobacco and non tobacco causes. In the United states, even in the face of notable industrial and urban environmental causative agents, tobacco remains the predominate cause of cancer mortality. After adjusting for the presence of other potential causes and their interaction with tobacco, tobacco accounts for over 75% of lung cancer deaths.2/ 72. Lung Cancer in China. Using the 1986 DSP data, the age adjusted mortality rate from lung cancer in China is 24.9 (Segi Wts.) or 29.2 (U.S. Wts.) for males and 15.5 (Segi) or 17.1 (U.S.) for females. Thus areas covered by the DSP system in China have a mortality rate from lung cancer of about 50% that in the United States and more than 25 times that found in the lowest incidence countries. The rate of lung cancer among men in urban areas is much higher than in rural areas (Annex Tables B-4 and B-5) reflecting the much shorter exposure to cigarette smoke among rural men. The same factor explains the sharp differences in lung cancer mortality between men and women. Comparing the 1986 DSP results with those from the 1975 Cancer Atlas survey, the mortality from lung cancer grew at about 9% a year over the ten-year interval while comparisons of the 1975 survey and DSP samples must be made with caution, it appears that there is an underlying increase in China's lung cancer rates paralleling the earlier experience in Europe and the United States. This growth would be consistent with tne current high prevalence of cigarette smoking among males, especially in urban areas, and the growth in cigarette smoking over the last twenty years. Because of the lag between the start of smoking and the emergence of cancer, and the importance of duration, it can be expected that lung cancer will now begin to grow as a major cause of death in China, first in the urban centers and then in rural areas and among those women who have been smoking for some years. Liver Cancer 73. Primary liver cancer (primary hepatocellular carcinoma, abbreviated PHC) is highly malignant. It is seldom diagnosed early and once diagnosed it is almost invariably followed by death. Because of difficulties in differential diagnosis of PHC at autopsy, PHC incidence and mortality data is of variable reliability, but it is clear from available information that PHC is one of the t5/ Ibid, Surgeon General, p49. S/ United States Public Health Service, Center for Disease Control, Morbidity and Mortality Weekly Report, October 30, 1987, Vol. 36, No. 42. -2.33 - commonest types of cancer in much of Africa and East Asia. In Zimbabwe it accounts for 18% of male cancer deaths, in Korea for 14%, in the Philippines for 15%, in Indonesia for 20%L/ and in Taiwan for 25.4%.2/ In contrast, in the United States and much of Europe liver cancer accounts for less than 1% of cancer deaths. The age adjusted mortality rate (Segi Wts.) per 100,000 males is 29.4 in Singapore, 14.4 in Japan, 2.4 in Canada, 3.7 in Belgium and 6.9 in France.2/ The mortality rates for females are roughly 20% to 50% those of males. In the Urnited States the age adjusted mortality rate (AAMR) (U.S. Wts.) is 1.2% for males and .5 for females less than 65 years of age.L6/ In most of the developed world the trend in mortality from liver cancer has been downward at an average percent change per year of about -0.5% for males and - 2.5% for females. 74. Two factors appear to be closely associated with most primary liver cancers in developing countries -- Hepatitis type B virus (HBV) and aflatoxins. 75. Hepatitis Type B. The etiology of Hepatitis B is complex. It known to be is transmitted through close contact with serum derived fluids including blood, dental exudates, dermatologic exudates, contaminated syringes and needles, or sexual contact. A frequent mode of transmission is mother to infant, in utero or during birth. Traditional public health literature maintains that it cannot be contracted through casual contact or the fecal- oral route; Of those who develop the disease, the case fatality ratef/ for those dying directly within a few months of the infection is approximately 125/100,000. Longer term consequences of the infection are much more severe and are all associated with development of a chronic, carrier-form of the disease. From twenty to forty years following the onset of Hepatitis B, those who have entered the carrier state are at much greater risk of mortality from both PHC and cirrhosis. The percentage of cases that become chronic is closely related to the age of onset; most infants who are infected become carriers, but less than 10% of adults infected become carriers. A study of HBV carriers in Taiwan found that the relative risk of PHC among carriers is 2/ Parkin. oD cit. 44 Lu-Yu Hwang, Chia-Chin and Chia-Siang Chien. \"Hepatocellular Carcinoma and Hepatitis B Virus: A Prospective Study of 22 707 Men in Taiwan\", Lancet, (November 21, 1981). 25/ Kurihara, M., K.

Among carriers, the mortality rate from PHC was 1158 per 100,000 and the mortality rate from cirrhosis was 492 per 100,000. Other studies suggest that smoking and alcohol consumption interact with the HBV carrier state to increase the risks of PHC and cirrhosis. 76. Aflatoxins. Aflatoxins are a naturally occurrinrg product of mold and fungus growing on stored grains and nuts. Inoculation .,ith the organisms can occur in the field or in storage. Aflatoxins are especialiy prevalent on peanuts and maize and are most common under tropical storage conditions. 'They may be an especially important contributing factor to liver cancer where peanuts and maize constitute an important part of the diet. Improved storage, under dry conditions and with good ventilation, can reduce the occurrence of aflatoxins. Also some experimental preventive programs are attempting to control the inoculation of grains and peanuts in the field through the use of chemicals, but the safety and efficacy of these programs is not fully established. 77. Liver Cancer in China. Measured in terms of years of life lost, liver cancer ranks first compared with other types of cancer in China (about 1.5 million YPLL, 21% below age 65). The mortality rate from liver cancer In China is among the highest in the world. The AAMR with the Peto weights is 18.9 for males and 6.4 for females less than 65 years old based on the 1986 DSP data. Using the same data and the Segi wts. the AAMR is 23.2 for males and 8.8 for females over all ages. Thus the Chinese rate is over 15 times that in the US and high even among Asian and African countries. The data from the 1975 Cancer Survey is consistent, giving a rate of 17.5 for males and 6.3 for females less than age 65 (U.S. Wts.) and suggesting that there has been essentially no change from 1975 to 1985 and a worsening for some age ranges. 78. Factors in the high mortality from PHC in China may include both aflatoxin and HBV but of these, HBV appears to be the predominant cause. HBV incidence in China is very high -half the population having the core-antibody (indicative of previous infection with HBV) and 13% of the population having the surface antigen (indicating continued .ifectability with HBV).La/ It is probable that most of the HBV cases are transmitted at birth, accounting for the high proportion of adults who are carriers. There is no standard treatment for HBV. Prevention strategies include immunization and improved sterilization of medical instruments, needles and syringes. Given the large proportion of Chinese cases that are acquired at birth or perinatally, the most effective preventive strategy is immunization of mothers as part of prenatal care. Substantial reductions of HBV cases should be possible to achieve with an immunization program and this could be expected to lead to a dramatic fall in the mortality from liver cancer, about 50 years later. Immediate, life-long benefits would accrue by avoidance of HBV illness episodes in immunized individuals. Some reduction in liver cancer could also result from improved storage for maize and other grains, especially in the southern areas of China. 2/ Junshi Chen, R. Peto, C. Campbell et al, A Preliminary Study of Dietary, Lifestyle, and Mortality Characteristics of 65 Rural Populations in the People's Republic of China. Oxford University, in press. -2.35 - Esophageal Cancer 79. Cancer of the esophagus is also of major importance as a cause of cancer mortality in China (Annex Tables B-4 and B-5). However, as it affects mainly the elderly it is less significant as a cause of YPLL (364,000, or 0.5% of YPLL below age 65). Mortality rates are extrermely high in some specific regions in China (100-200/100,000) suggestin, that environmental or dietary/lifestyle habits may be of importance as causal factors. The male:female ratio is 2:1 and the urban:rural ratio is 0.6 (Annex Charts 1.6 to 1.8 in Annex 1) which probably reflects smoking prevalence and duration. Considerable clinical and field research into the risk factors other than smoking for esophageal cancer has been underway for many years in China. Clinical research aimed at early detection and effective treatment has also had priority for some years. Results have been disappointing on both fronts. 80. Esophageal cancer is seldom detected before it manifests itself by difficulty with swallowing. Treatment is of little effect and once it becomes evident esophageal cancer most often results in de. h within less than a year. Over the last thirty years the trend in Europe and the United States has been a reduction in the number of cases treated through surgery with radiation therapy increasing in use but without clear effect. The five year survival rate is about 3% averaged over all stages and 5% for the local stage. There has been little change in survival over the last forty years. 81. Esophageal Cancer in Other Countries. On a global basis esophageal cancer is of variable importance. The pattern of esophageal cancer appears to be culturally determined through diet, food handling practices, drinking alcohol and smoking. Generally, the rates of esophageal cancer are lower in developed countries and higher in the developing world but this generalization has many exceptions. In Zimbabwe esophageal cancer accounts for 13% of male cancer deaths and about 26 of female cancer deaths, in India for 8.3% for males and 6.4% for females (Ahmedabad), in Korea for 2.8% for males and .4% fo: females, and in the Philippines (metro Manilla) for 2% for males and 0.9% for females.!!/ In the United States esophageal cancer accounts for 2.5% of male cancer deaths and 1% of female deaths. Some selected age adjusted mortality rates (Segi wts.) are 7.2 for males and 1.6 for females in Japan, 9.2 for males and 2.1 for females in Singapore, 4.3 for males and 1.2 for females in the United States, 14.6 for males and 1.1 for females in France, 16.0 for males and 4.5 for females in Uruguay. With the exception of France, where there has been an annual increase of over 1% in male esophageal cancer deaths since 1950, the rates in most countries have been stable over time with essentially no change in male rates and a slight downward trend in female rates. O 82. Possible Risk Factors for Esophageal Cancer. In the West, tobacco smoking has been shown to be a major risk factor for the development of L9/ Selected geographic areas from D. M. Parkin (Ed.), op cit. L'/ See Kurihara, oD cit, for detailed information. -2.36 - esophageal cancer and the same can safely be presumed to be true for China. However, the unusually high rates of esophageal cancer in parts of China indicate there must be other very important risk factors. Many studies have shown a correlation between the consumption of preserved foods, especially salted or smoked foods, and esophageal cancer. Laboratory experiments with animals suggest that the causative agents are nitrosamine compounds, which are among the most powerful carcinogens known. Such compounds may either be present directly in consumed foods or they can be formed in the body by chemical reactions between various nitrates and nitrosable compounds in the digestive track. The required constituent nitrogen compounds occur naturally in many foods, including fish and meat, and are also often present as a pesticide residue or additive for food preservation.L./ Production of nitrites from naturally occurring nitrates ingested in vegetables is of particular importance. The process by which the conversion occurs in the body is not well established, but it is thought that the presences of other chemicals, for example formaldehyde or chemicals present in tobacco smoke, and a slightly acid medium, abet the formation of nitrosamines. Scme processes of preservation of foods provide the required coastituents for the production of nitrosamines. 83. Esophageal Cancer in China. The mortality rate for esophageal cancer in China is the highest in the world. Using the 1985 DSP data, the age adjusted mortality rate is 16.4 (Segi Wts.) or 19.2 (U.S. Wts.) for males and 8.0 (Segi Wts.) or 9;3 (Peto Wts.) for females. Thus, the Chinese mortality rate from esophageal cancer of almost four times that in the United States and over 100 times that found in the lowest incidence countries. The 1975 cancer atlas survey showed even higher rates of 31 (Segi Wts.) for males and 15.4 for fema'Les. It is improbable that the rate fell greatly over the ten year period from 1975 to 1985 and the difference between the two rates may be explained by the fact that esophageal cancer is highly recognized in China. The highest rates for esophageal cancer are observed in Henan and Jiangsu and were over 16 times those in Yunnan and Guangxi the provinces with the lowest rates. 84. Primary Prevention. The only known, effective primary prevention effort is to avoid or stop smoking and reduce alcohol consumption and these steps should have the primary role in any programs directed toward esophageal cancer. Because of the difficulty of detecting esophageal cancer at an early stage and the rapid course of the cancer towards death once detected, secondary prevention programs are not of use. However, epidemiological studies of the causes of the cancer hold a small possibility of additional effective methods of primary prevention. There have been several studies focussing on the geographic variability of esophageal cancer in China. A revealing study on data from Henan province showed a high correlation between salt consumption and the mortality rates for esophageal and gastric cancer. !/ 5/ Doll and Peto, op cit, p 1228. 5/ Jian-Bang Lu and Yu-Min Qin, \"Correlation between High Salt Intake and Mortality Rates for Oesophageal and Gastric Cancers in Henan Province, China\",Internatio:ial Journal of Epidemiology, Vol. 16, No. 2, pp 171- 176. -2.37 - / The correlation strongly suggests a relationship between salt preserved and pickled foods and esophageal cancer, such as has been found in other research outside of China. Other research has shown that pickled vegetables of a type common in Linhsien County, where esophageal cancer has a gross mortality rate of almost 100 and accounts for 20% of all deaths, readily produce nitrosamines in the stomachs of laboratory animals.!!/ More research is needed to identify the exact foods involved in each region but the methodology to discover the foods is clear and the epidemiological techniques are established. / Pursuit of such research should not be at the expens6 of funding for the major, known and effective primary prevention efforts of smoking control and reduction of alcohol consumption. 85. Although many of the causative agents, at least those involved with food, appear to be the same for stomach and esophageal cancer, global data suggest that there are sufficient differences that, unlike stomach cancer (see the discussion above in this section), esophageal cancer may not spontaneously decrease with changes in diet as income increases with economic development. The rate of esophageal cancer has remained fairly stable and high in Japan over the last thirty years and the rates for France and Uruguay are high in spite of the relatively high per capita incomes in these countries. Thus, in addition to smoking cessation, a primary prevention program for esophageal cancer would require identification of specific high risk foods and an educational campaign to change .ating habits and food preservation. Such a campaign is most likely to be successful with concomitant increases in income and wider availability of varied foods that will allow greater diet choice. Changes in eating habits may be difficult to achieve, especially in rural areas, because current practices are the result of centuries old traditions and dietary evolution and are only now important because of increased life expectancy. other Cancer 86. The four cancers discuissed above account for 53% of total years of life lost to cancer in China. Of the remaining cancers, leukemia is the most important cause, accounting for 13% of total years of life lost and 25% of the category, \"other cancer\". There is no clear preventive action for leukemia. Worldwide rates vary little either across countries or over time and rates lie within a band of about 3 to 6 per 100,000 with female rates being about two- thirds those of males. There has been very little change in world rates over the last 30 years except in countries, such as Japan, that had very low rates of leukemia at the start of the 30 year period and even in these countries the rate of change has been low. The 1986 age adjusted mortality rate in China is 5/ Brian Henderson, \"Observations on Cancer Etiology in China\", United States, Department of Health, National Cancer Institute Monograph No. 53.,pp 59-65. L/ However, many of the caveats and complexities cited for prevention of gastric cancer are also true for esophageal cancer. Funding for research in these areas should take a clear second priority to adequate fundin& of anti-smoking programs and health education programs. -2.38 - among the lowest in the world. Risk factors for leukemia include radiation and environmental and occupational exposures and with increasing industrialization it would be expected that the rate of change in leukemia would increase slowly, perhaps on the basis of experience elsewhere at an annual rate of less than 1.5% in both males and females. Therapy is increasingly proving to be effective in the management of some leukemia and should not be ruled out as an appropriate response for patients with good prognosis. 87. Several of the remaining cancers are of interest because there are potential secondary prevention programs that are feasible. These selected remaining cancers include cancer of the breast, cervix, and colon. The current rate for these cancers is low in China. However, the rate of increase in these cancers has been positively associated with economic development in the rest of the world. A positive association would also be expected in China over the next thirty years as exposure to environmental and occupational carcinogens increases with industrialization. Thus as development occurs, secondary prevention programs may become beneficial. Whil- total avoidable premature deaths and suffering will be small relative to the other chronic diseases in the next few years the relative importance of well-designed, inexpensive screening programs will become more important with the predictable and largely inevitable demographic and epidemiologic changes underway. Cervical cancer provides a good example of this and is discussed in the section below. Cervical Cancer 88. Cancer of the cervix involves the neoplasm of cells in and around the cervix uteri. It seems to be progressive from mild cervical dysplasia (a pre- cancerous condition of cellular irritation), which if untreated is believed to lead to development of cancerous cells. Early cell irritation can develop into lesions which are subject to secondary infection from a variety of viruses or bacteria. Progression is to cells which demonstrate cancerous changes and can become invasive in the neck and channel of the uterus and can metastasize to remote spots in the body. Three stages of cervical disease are commonly identified -- cervical dysplasia, cancer of the cervix in situ (confined to superficial cancerous lesions), and invasive cervical carcinoma. Cervical dysplasia is easily treated with a variety of techniques with few side effects. Cervical cancer in situ is relatively easily treated and has an average five-year survival rate of almost 90% in the West. Invasive carcinoma is treated only through a complete hysterectomy, which is costly, partially disabling and only modestly successful (five-year survival rates of 32% to 40% in the United States). 89. International Experience. Over the last 55 yea.s cervical cancer has fallen as a cause of cancer mortality from first to sixth in the United States. Mortality rates during this period have dropped dramatically from over 30/100,000 to less than 5/100,000 (1984). Experience in Europe appears to have been similar. Even within the last decade considerable progress in early detection of cervical cancer and its precursors has been made with average ten-year mortality rates continuing to drop to less than half the -2.39 - levels of the 1950's.5/ More important, incidence of new cases among all age groups is on the decline.L6/ These substantial improvements have resulted in a large decline in the YPLL due to cervical cancer. The trend has also meant declining requirements for hospitalization. This is particularly important in an aging population, as the incidence increases sharply with age. 90. Prevalence ard Incidence in China. Cancer of the cervix is the third most common cause of female death from cancer in China. For all Chinese women, it is second only to cancer of the stomach with a mortality of 10.1/100,000 per year (1986). This is a moderately low absolute rate and would rank China about 20th out of 47 countries with data reported.L7/ There is considerable geographical variation of the rate within China, with some regions having mortality of over 60/100,000. Many rural areas have considerably higher rates than the national average. 91. Primary Prevention. Known risk factors are related to hygiene, herpes simplex viral infection and sexual practices. Late age of initiation of intercourse and few sexual partners alleviate the major known risk factors for most Chinese women. These factors may help to explain the low relative rate of cervical cancer in China in comparison to other countries of similar income levels. There is known to be a strong inverse correlation of the incidence of cervical cancer with poverty, probably in part due to better hygiene with income growth and in part due to greater utilization of health services. It seems reasonable in China also to expect that general economic growth may result in a declining trend in the incidence of cervical cancer. However, as the prevalence of the disease directly increases with age, prevalence in China can be expected to be subject to upward pressures in line with the demographic shift. Overall, much better epidemiologic data is needed, on a regional level, to define the true prevalence and the risk groups in China for cervical cancers. Most county-level hospitals are capable of implementing small survey programs and in selected areas this could be done as a part of primary health care checkup to try to better ascertain the incidence of dysplasia, and cancer in situ, as well as invasive cervical carcinoma. Particular minority groups or regional groupings may well be found to be at much higher risk than the rest of the population. 92. Secondary Prevention. Detection of precancerous conditions of the cervix can easily be done through cytological examination of cells scraped from the cervix (the Pap Smear). Training of cytologists to read the slides L5/ Average ten-year cervical cancer mortality rates for the U.S. per 100,000 by race and by decade for the 1950's, 1960' and 1970's were respectively: whites 9.1, 6.9, and 4.2; blacks 21.2, 17.3, 10.2. L/ Incidence of cervical cancer in situ in 1975 for white and black females in the U.S. were 11.0 and 27.6/100,000 respectively; these have declined steadily to 1984 levels of 8.1 and 16/100,000. L7/ Source: World Health Statistics Annual, 1982-84. Age-adjusted death rates for selected sites for 47 countries, 1980-81. Data for China are 1973-75. -2.40 - is not difficult. In other countries, the training of physicians or nurses to take a proper scraping has proven more difficult. The incremental costs of carrying out selective screening may also be small if the effort is properly focused and combined with other primary health care contacts.!!/ As mentioned above, the survival rates in other countries after detection and treatment of precursor conditions for invasive cervical cancer have been very good. Experience in Shanghai has been similar, where a screening program began in 1958 among textile workers and gradually expanded to other employment groups. Mortality dropped from 19.9/100,000 (1964) to 9.5/100,000 (1977) with the greatest decline among women aged 35 to 64 (a decline from 45.1 to 12.3/100,000). The effectiveness of screening is indicated by the experience in the West where over a 20-year period cervical cancer in situ has increased from a very low percentage of reported cases to over 80% of all newly reported cases. 93. China should focus its screening program on those groups knowni to be at high risk. Current practice in many areas of China is to screen every married woman every two years regardless of age or risk factors. Given the late age for marriage in China and what is known of the incidence of cervical cancer, health authorities may initially want to focus their efforts on the 45-75 year old age groups. Normally, screening should be performed to obtain a good probability of a true negative (perhaps once each year for two years) and less frequently thereafter (every five years) until age 55 or 60 when the frequency of testing may be increased slightly to take account of the greater age- induced risk. Such programs can be carried out in a variety of venues, taking advantage of China's established health infrastructure. External Causes (Suicides and Iniuries) 94. International Experience. Injuries -intentional, unintentional and occupational -while not traditionally considered as a disease are a major cause of morbidity and throughout the world are a leading cause of premature death. Unlike other causes of morbidity and death the victim is often viewed as being at \"fault\" or the event is accepted as having been \"unavoidable\" despite an enormous body of evidence to the contrary. During the epidemiologic transition the relative and absolute importance of external causes of death often increases dramatically. Worldwide, injuries and suicide are the leading cause of death among people aged 4-44. Their impact is even more profound in terms of the years of potential life lost, disabilities, health care costs and wages and taxes foregone. 95. Many developed countries have been slow to recognize the huge burden that injuries place on the health and welfare of their societies and in many cultures injuries are not perceived as being harms that can be prevented. In the United States injuries caused 143,000 deaths in 1983, the fourth cause of death overall; it caused more than half the deaths of children aged 5-14 and !!/ Ref. \"Evaluation of Three Cervical Cancer Detection Programs in Japan with Special Reference to Cost-Benefit Analysis\", Takenage et al, Cancer 55:2514-2519, 1985. -2.41 - nearly 89% of deaths for young people aged 15-24.!!/ The cost of this toll and non-fatal injuries is estimated to be more than US$160 billion annually in direct and indirect costs. 96. Injuries have moved to prominence as a public health problem throughout the world for a number of reasons as control of infectious diseases and reductions in mortality attributable to them has proceeded. New hazards have been introduced into the workplace with rapid industrialization, on highways and streets as motor vehicle traffic has expanded, on farms and in homes as new products and machinery become available. High rise buildings and changes in construction technology pose new injury hazards for those who construct them, and later, for those who occupy them. Pesticides, fertilizers and their use pose hazards of poisoning. 97. Almost all significant injuries which do not result in immediate fatality require hospital care; many injuries necessitate lengthy, even life- long, periods of rehabilitative therapy or care; many injuries result in some degree of disablement. Less easily measured costs include pain, grief, family and social disruption, and the long-term disability, such as caused by severe burns, epilepsy from head injury, limitations of mobility from spinal cord injury, amputations, traumatic arthritis, and severe reduction in mental function from head injury. These burdens fall not only on the patient, but also on the community and families which lose their productive members or have to care for them. Not only do the health facilities and insurance systems have to bear the cost of assisting those who are non-fatally injured but they are often long absent from their jobs and careers with consequent economic losses. All of these aspects of injuries are relevant for China to consider. 98. External Causes of Death in China. Injuries and suicides are now recognized to be major and growing problems in China. However, as in many countries, injuries and suicides are not now specifically designated as a health problem for which the MOPH or local health bureaus have specific surveillance or prevention responsibilities. As a result, injuries are not addressed as a priority in China's health promotion or disease prevention programs. 99. In the past, partial responsibility for reporting external causes of death has been spread among several different agencies at the local level. For example, the traffic safety authorities maintained data on the place, time, circumstances and type of traffic accidents but not necessarily the final outcome. These data were not routinely shared with other local authori- ties for surveillance and planning purposes. The health system itself had access only to injuries reported by hospitals and these data often did not !!I These high rates include suicide and homicide which are high for some risk groups. Homicides, thankfully, is typically not a major problem for China. The U.S. percentages also are high because the denominator is small -that is few in these age groups die from other causes. These two factors make the already high China rates even more important for authorities to consider. -2.42 - contain information on the circumstances of injury which would be needed for an epidemiological approach to injury and suicide prevention. 100. Recently, a number of improvements have been initiated which may give China a substantial advantage in dealing with its injury and suicide problem. Many provinces have now established interdepartmental committees under the Economic and Planning Commission, coordinated usually by the Public Security Bureau and chaired by a vice-governor, with centralized reporting to the Public Security Ministry in Beijing.Lo/ Regular reporting of injuries and mortality takes place through this structure and would appear to cover most events. On the other hand, rapid changes in local economies because of decentralization and increased competition in service provision in most sectors, has presented a very rapidly changing challenge for these local authorities. Proliferation of vehicles, boats, industries and the training of personnel involved in operating and maintaining the machines involved has outstripped capacity to regulate these in any meaningful sense. / Nonetheless, existence of this system gives China the opportunity to take a planned approach to injury and suicide surveillance, epidemiological analysis of causes and risk factors, and hence to development and implementation of an injury prevention program. The problem to be addressed is that injuries occur too frequently and that too much data is generated to be useful. The need is for a surveillance system to be developed for serious injuries. 101. Prevalence and Composition of Injury and Suicides. Data which would help to document the nature and extent of the monetary burden of injuries and !/ Representation on the committee varies somewhat among provinces but usually includes: Public Security Bureau (divisions responsible for road safety, fires, and explosives/murder/suicide); Railways (divisions for worker safety, rolling stock, track and systems safety, and passenger and public right-of-way safety); Production and Transport Bureau (divisions responsible for all forms of road transport and for industrial and agricultural production); Labor and Personnel Bureau (divisions responsible for worker protection regulations (dust control, attire, and equipment technologies); labor insurance; physical suitability for job and nutrition requirements; Water Transport Bureau (personnel and equipment safety and training standards for inland water transport); and Agriculture, Animal Husbandry and Fisheries Bureau (pesticides, fertilizers and silviculture safety). In some provinces, the Public Health Bureau has been given data coordination and analysis responsibilities. This would allow an epidemiologic approach to prevention and seems to be a sound approach. 5/ For example from 1984 to 1986 in Zhejiang Province the number of small water craft carrying passengers and cargo has grown from 140,000 to 330,000; the number of townships and village enterprises has mushroomed in a similar fashion and the number of injuries in these are estimated to be three times larger than those occurring in larger state enterprises. -2.43 - suicide have been very scarce.!5/ However, recently released national data from 1987 (and DSP data for 1987 and 1988) indicate the already serious problem of external causes of death. Annex Chart 2.10 shows age-specific mortality rates for the leading external causes of death. The clear ispact of drowning for children, suicide in young adulthood and old age, and traffic accidents across all ages is indicated in the chart. 102. The burden of injury and suicide falls heavily on rural areas (total rates of 80 for men; 62 for women) and on sen (about a third higher rates than women in both urban and rural areas). Annex Chart 2.11 decomposes the shares of this burden however and shows the importance of vehicle accidents in urban areas, suicide among women and drowning in rural areas.

This is understandable as these are sensitive data in many countries. As Public Security authorities come to understand the nature of the recomnendations being made in this report it is hoped that the already good level of domestic concern with injuries will be further heightened and will result in appropriate surveillance, epidemiologic analysis and action being taken, even if overall data cannot be made more public. -2.44 - Gne h=r 2. 11 External Causes of Death, Composition Sham (i) and Raets pw 100.000 Motor Sul9 de ~~~~~Urban Females Urban Males (Total InJury Rate 38) (Total InJury Rate -47) 8ul (Total InJ47y Rat 82J 2.12 show clearly how injuries are priO arily a burden for the young and middle ages. While rates among the elderly are hlgh (Annex Chart 2.10), total death rates at those ages are much higher and injuries present a much less significant total burden than age -specific rates only would indicate. The absolute levels of injury death for China are staggering (about 540a,0 deaths per year, equivalent to about 3 fully loaded Jumbo jet crashes per day) and the age and sex specific data isply much of this burden falls on young families azid a surprising amount of it on young women. Suicide is the leading cause of death for women aged 15-44. Years of premature lifse lost to injuries and suicides annually below age 65 in China are estimated to total 16.8 million, 24.5% of total YPLL. This is almnst certainly an underestimation of the true figure but it gives a sense of the relative priority which China should attach to injury prevention. -2.45 - Anrex Chart 2.12 External Causes of Death Leading Cause as a Share of Total Age Specific Death Rates, All Diseses 30% External Causes of Death Cumulative Shares by Leding Causes of Total Age-Speciflc Death Rates 60% _Othor 103. Other glimpses of data underline the seriousness of the problem. In Shaanxi Province traffic fatalities in 1987 were just under 2,000, a 10% increase from 1986. Zhejiang Province has experienced similar levels with about 2900 traffic deaths and 9500 traffic injuries in 1987 (increases of about 25% and 13% respectively over 1986 levelsL2/). These deaths indicate an annual mortality rate due to traffic accidents of about 6.6/100,000 and 7.3/100,000 for Shaanxi and Zhejiang Provinces respectively. Data at the provincial level indicate that motor vehicle injuries and death are rising at a rate faster than the increase in vehicles. Other leading causes oi injury mortality are suicide, drowning, fall, poisoning, fire, water transport accidents, and railway and industrial accidents. 104. Injury prevention trials similar to those conducted in other countries for heart disease could easily be conducted for prevention efforts such as enforced laws, helmets, use of seat belts, child restraints, obeying signals, passing behavior on highways, driver education program, etc. School-based injury prevention education programs could be developed and tested in simple, large scale randomized trials. Water and road transport safety training programs could also be evaluated in randomized trials. The potential contribution of alcohol consumption to injuries should be investigated in areas and among groups where it may be a growing problem. Further research and consolidation of reporting systems to provide better, detailed data should allow targeted injury avoidance and prevention programs which have very high economic returns through reduction of disability and death. Injuries as a source of morbidity and cause of death is a primary example of where prevention would be much more effective than building expensive trauma units for treatment of the injured. Diabetes 105. Diabetes is a chronic disease characterized by abnormally high blood glucose concentrations. The raised levels of blood glucose, if sufficiently high as with individuals having insulin-dependent diabetes, can lead to coma and death. 106. There are two main types of diabetes -insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus (IDDM) and non-insulin dependent diabetes mellitus (NIDDM). These appear to have two distinctly different etiologies and characteristics yet share the same common deficit of raised blood glucose levels. IDDM is characterized by a complete lack of insulin production, a relatively young age of onset (modal age -10-12 years at onset), abrupt onset, antibodies produced to the pancreatic tissue and associations with specific genetic markers. In contrast, NIDDM cases typically have relatively high insulin levels (although ineffective in stimulating glucose disposal), an older age at onset, a slow insidious onset, no auto-antibodies, and no strong associations to genetic markers. IDDM requires daily insulin injections to maintain life whereas 2/ A reference point for the early 1980s in Zhejiang would have been an average of three traffic deaths/day, or about 1100/year. Uniformly, local authorities report that injuries are growing rapidly and anecdotal data and newspaper accounts support this generalization. -2.47 - NIDDM can typically be controlled through diet, physical exercise and possibly, oral agents. 107. IDDM is one of the leading, if not the leading, chronic diseases of children worldwide. Approximately 5-10% of diabetes on a population basis is of the insulin requiring form. IDDM patients are eight times more likely to die than non-diabetic individuals and NIDDM cases are at 2-3 times increased mortality risk. Diabetes of either type is an additional major risk factor for cardiovascular disease. It is associated with vascular changes in the retina which may lead to blindness, kidney damage which may lead to renal failure and peripheral vascular disease which may lead to damage of the lower limb tissues, ulceration and infection, and in severe cases, gangrene requiring amtutation. Diabetes also directly increases the risks of complications in pregnancy with higher rates of fetal abnormality and marked adverse outcome of pregnancy for individuals. 108. In the United States and many other countries diabetes was long unrecognized as a major problem and the same may be true of China. Research in the last decade has clearly established diabetes as a leading underlying cause of death and disability in the West. In the U.S. it annually accounts for an estimated 145,000 years of premature life lost (YPLL) before age 65 and is associated with 10 times that number of YPLL as an underlying cause of death. Diabetes ^ontributes to risk of congenital malformation and intrauterine death, it sharply increases mortality from hypertension, coronary heart disease and worsens the effect of peripheral vascular disease; it is a leading cause of blindness, of end stage renal disease, and of neuropathy and amputations. Annual costs to the U.S. economy have been estimated to total US$7.9 billion for direct treatment and US$10 billion for indirect costs due to disability and premature death. 109. Prevalence and Incidence in China. Many Chinese physicians do not believe that diabetes is a problem. Mortality and morbidity from diabetes is very difficult to estimate because death certificates seldom list underlying causes of death in China. The DSP system shows mortality rates for diabetes for person 40-65 years of age are 5.5/100,000 with urban areas having about twice the rates of rural areas for the same age groups (6.5 versus 3.1). Differences probably reflect life style risks and better diagnosis and reporting. Prevalence data for China are available only from a 1980 survey which found a rate of 0.67% with corsiderable regional variation compared to the U.S. average prevalence is 2.4% (unadjusted data). More detailed surveys (Benji Iron Company and at Da Qing) reported prevalence rates of 2.26% and about 1.5%, respectively. IDDM diabetes is said to account for about 5% of this prevalence, similar to the proportion it accounts for in the West. Incidence data from the Da Qing survey report higher levels (6/1000) of new diabetes than in the West. Data from Tianjin indicate an approximate doubling of the incidence of IDDM diabetes in the last decade to 10/100,000 per year. This increase is most probably the result of better reporting rather than a true increase but it indicates that the incidence of IDDM diabetes may not be so much lower than the U.S. average of 15/100,000 Lnnually and is much higher (5 -20 times) than that reported in other parts of Asia. Chinese researchers who specialize in diabetes agree that as fragmentary as these data are they indicate that diabetes appears to be a major, unrecognized and growing chronic -2.48 - disease in China. In national terms, there may be between 7 and 15 million diabetics in China and within the next 15 years if prevalence similar to that in the West continues to develop as it appears likely to there may be about 20-30 million diabetics. 110. Juvenile Diabetes. Many health personnel have not considered IDDM (juvenile) diabetes to be important because its prevalence has appeared to be low in China as it is known to be in Japan. Whether this is true is very unclear in part because of characteristics of the disease which often inhibit its detection at the primary care level. Acute ketoac'dosis, which often is the first clinical mantfestation of juvenile diabetes, is easily confused with influenza and gastroenteritis. Death can occur quickly, ar.d its cause be misdiagnosed if prompt access to reliable blood sugar monitoring and a practitioner with enough experience to manage the initial critical event is not readily at hand. These requirements would not likely be met today for many rural or urban patients today in China, and it may be that there is much undiagnosed juvenile diabetes mortality. This conclusion tends to be supported by the fact that while juvenile diabetes is virtually unreported in rural areas, it is found in urban areas and in the special surveys, probably because of better diagnosis and reporting. If the survey data and Tianjin incidence are approximately correct, a very crude estimate of current mortality (assuming that all children who are not diagnosed correctly die within a short period) would be 20,000-40,000 juvenile deaths annually for ages under 20 accounting for 1-2 million YPLL annually.L4/ While these approximations are too crude for policy actions they indicate the urgent need for sample surveys to better define data so that policies can be developed. This is particularly important in view of the \"one child\" family policy as most IDDM diabetes mortality will occur when parental ages make a subsequent pregnancy risky or improbable. Ill. NIDDM Diabetes. It would appear that, as in many countries, adult on- set diabetes in ChinaD/ is often undetected by the primary care practitioner because it is not routinely and reliably considered as a diagnosis and its subclinical symptoms are often masked by the symptoms of aging and ill health, 64./ Most Type I diabetes will occur under age 20. Probably 95% of these cases would result in fatality today in China as the medical system is not well placed to promptly diagnose and manage these cases. Approximate 400 million Chinese youth are in the \"at risk age cohorts. Incidence rates of 5 to 10/100,000 would produce these death figures at, say, an average age of 14, with 55 years of potential life lost per case. t/ Evidence from expatriate Chinese indicates that the potential frequency of NIDDM may be much higher for Chinese than has been reported from China. There are several studies (Singapore, Taiwan, and unpublished data from Mauritius) where the frequency of NIDDM according to WHO criteria exceeds 10% in adults aged 20 years and over. These studies suggest that the potential genetic susceptibility of Chinese people to the development of diabetes is considerable. Dr. Peter Bennett, Epidemiology and Clinical Research, National Institutes of Health, personal communication. -2.49 - including of the chronic diseases to which it is a primary contributing factor. / It is well known however that mortality and general morbidity rates for people with diabetes are higher than for those of the general population. The excess mortality for adult-onset diabetes increases with age and may approximate 2-3 times the norm for older age groups with otherwise the same risk factors. The Framingham Study (Framingham, Massachusetts) reported death due to CVD was 2.9 times more common among diabetics than non-diabetics. Diabetes was found to be the second or third most important attributable risk factor for both men and women for stroke, coronary heart disease and peripheral vascular disease. These findings are particularly significant for China as it will experience an increased prevalence of these diseases in the course of the epidemiological transition. If the true prevalence of diabetes is now even one-half the rates in the West, it will be a major contributing factor to the complications and mortality of cardiovascular diseaee and micro- vascular disease of all types. For example, risk of end-stage renal disease in China is already high amongst those groups with severe hypertension. It is cowmon today to find hospital administrators who are concerned with end-stage renal disease and who are pressing for establishment of expensive renal units in their hospitals. Diabetes increases 17-fold the age-adjusted relative risk of end-stage renal disease for hypertensive patients. Given the risks and costs of dialysis and transplantation as treatment for renal disease, increased attention to proper management of the diabetic-hypertensive patient is clearly a very cost effective strategy for China as compared with the establishment of more renal units. 112. Prevention Strategies. Causes of diabetes are not well understood. Risk factors include obesity, genetic and familial factors, and environmental (possibly viral) factors (for IDDM). At this time there are no known prevention measures for IDDM nor is there any cure. The risk of NIDDM increases sharply with age. Avoidance of obesity and regular exercise appear to have primary prevention effects, especially in individuals with impaired glucose tolerance. For both types of diabetes, some limited success has been reported in parts of the world including China with different types of cell and organ transplantation techniques and with mechanical implants. For now, the very limited effectiveness and high costs these approaches rule them out as basic elements in a program to combat diabetes. Basic and applied clinical research is very costly and is underway in many other parts of the world. It is highly unlikely that causes of diabetes in China will be different from those elsewhere. It therefore seems wise for China to balance only modest L/ In the West, undetected and untreated, borderline adult diabetes has been found to be a major cause of adverse outcomes in pregnancy for both mother and child. No Chinese data appear to be available on this point and it may be that substantial pregnancy related diabetes problems, particularly in the rural areas, are causing needless mortality. China's MCH hospitals could easily conduct surveys to determine the incidence of diabetes which becomes manifest only during pregnancy (gestational diabetes) and determine its importance as a risk factor in pregnancy. Careful perinatal care for prevention of the complications of diabetes during pregnancy would be a low cost intervention with substantial benefits given China's already well-developed MCH care infrastructure. -2.50 - programs of fundamental biological and clinical research with rather substantial funding for epidemiological surveys and educational programs for detection and secondary prevention to avoid complications of diabetes and primary prevention of NIDD14. Both the specific elements of such a strategy and cost effectiveness of this approach have been proven elsewhere and promise to be better for China than a strategy based on basic research. 113. The 2nly known primary prevention against the risk of NIDDM diabetes (in populations) is weight control and its significance is not clear for individuals. The prevention strategy for diabetes must therefore be limited to screening gnly during normal primary health contacts when sugars can be checked without significant additional expense. If funds do not allow screening of the entire adult population, the screening should be focussed on the age groups and population groups (obese persons and the children and siblings of known diabetics) who are known to be at higher risk than the normal population. 114. Screening is easily and inexpensively done with urine sugar testing (by paper reagent strip) to detect those with potential onset, followed by fasting blood glucose or glucose tolerance tests of those who test positive. Chinese manufactured reagent strips are reported to be of uneven quality. This threatens not only screening programs but proper patient self-management by those who are diabetic as the same technique and product is used. Poor quality strips, and inadequate patient education in the proper management of blood sugar levels will directly result in greater frequency of both insulin reactions and ketoacidosis (both potentially fatal). It will also result in the complications of diabetes being more frequent and more severe than need be the case. Small cohort studies of diabetics with improved monitoring materials and better counseling, in comparison to control groups, would allow approximation of the costs China is incurring in terms of both YPLL and in excess hospitalization for complications by not having better quality materials and newer technologies available. Evidence from detailed studies done elsewheref/ shows such overwhelming evidence of the wisdom of enabling the patient to do better self-management that its detailed study in China should not be a precondition to development and funding of education and community support programs as quickly as local health systems can adapt their priorities. Health authorities need not spend substantial resources developing materials and protocols for both practitioners and patients as these have been well-prepared elsewhere6./ and only need modifying to suit some aspects of China's situation. Experience elsewhere with this approach indicates that 50% and more of the complications of both types of diabetes are preventable with consequent large savings in terms of both suffering and death and expensive hospital care. 67 For example, see \"Closing the Gap: The Problem of Diabetes Mellitus in the United States\", The Carter Center of Emory University, Atlanta, Georgia. !!I See, \"The Prevention and Treatment of Five Complications of Diabetes\", developed by the National Diabetes Advisory Board, Centers for Disease Control Publication HHS 83-8392. -2.51 - 115. Chinese with diabetes should be encouraged to view themselves as a population with a disproportionate number of risk factors and should be encouraged to adopt healthful life-styles, to control obesity, hypertension cholesterol levels and blood glucose levels, and to stop smoking. It is clear that these common risk factors interact with diabetes to produce serious disease. For these people access to education, dietary and social support systems and medical care are vital. Barriers to access of these services, including financial barriers, should be removed as this will in the end benefit both the patient and the economy. Physicians should recognize that it is not acceptable to regard ketoacidosis, adverse pregnancy outcomes, blindness and amputations as the inevitable consequences of diabetes. The health system needs to see that patients have the knowledge and skills necessary for self-care and to ensure that hypertension, pregnancy, retinopathy, kidney disease and foot disease are diagnosed in a timely manner and treated appropriately. Community based programs of diabetes education will be important to this process. Technically, and by virtue of past experiences with such targeted approaches, China's health system should be well-positioned to effectively implement such a strategy. 116. Other Chronic Diseases. Most data available in China, and indeed, in other countrias, concerns mortality. The lack of data, however, should not obscure the importance of diseases and problems that do not usually cause death, but are causes of illness and of extensive use of health services. Cirrhosis is one example. While data to indicate the severity of alcohol abuse as a risk factor is not now available, it must present a problem for some, and perhaps for particular population sub-groups. The sex ratio differences for both cirrhosis and liver cancer (see Annex Chart 1.6 in Annex 1) are indicative of substantially greater increased risk for men which cannot be explained by exposure to HBV where sex ratios should be fairly uniform. One plausible explanation is that exposure to alcohol, and possibly its abuse, is much higher (among men) than is commonly asserted. Liver disease attributable to this will almost certainly become a problem amongst groups who have higher exposure and can be an expensive, and avoidable, cause of morbidity and death. This would be an inLeresting and probably very effective area for further epidemiological and sociological research for some of China's medical schools. 117. Another example where data is lacking today is musculoskeletal disease, including arthritis. Rheumatoid arthritis is the most frequent form of the disease causing loss of work in the U.K. and the U.S. because it frequently affects people between 20 and 65 years of age. This disease is also appears important as a cause of disability in China but another form of the disease, ankylosing spondylitis!!/, which affects mainly younger men (starting in their twenties) may be even more common. While this condition is uncommon in the 5/ Ankylosing spondylitis is a form of inflammatory arthritis which usually affects the spine and gives rise to incapacitating low back and neck pain, and which is frequently misdiagnosed as due to degenerative arthritis. Rheumatoid arthritis is also an inflammatory arthrit,s which causes severe pain and swelling, most frequently affecting the hands and feet. -2.52 - West preliminary data from China suggest that it may be the most frequent form of arthritis in China.2/ Overall the problems presented by the musculoskeletal diseases are likely to grow in importance especially in an aging population. In the United States, about 12 million people, or about 5% of the population, have limitations of activity from such disorders, a figure greater than for any other disease category. Musculoskeletal impairments affects about 10% of the population, with the spine most commonly involved, followed by the lower extremity or hip, and upper extremity or shoulder. Each year about 9% of the U.S. population has an acute condition of the musculoskeletal system, including fractures, dislocations, sprains, and strains, severe enough so that medical care is sought or activity restricted. 118. Three other important chronic conditions are low back and neck disorders, osteoporosis, and osteoarthritis. Low back and neck pain are common in the West, with up to 80% of the population experiencing it at some time during their lives. Osteoporosis involves loss of bone mass, rendering bone susceptible to fracture. It is particularly found in post-menopausal women. Osteoarthritis, or degenerative joint disease, is characterized by pain and stiffness of the joints, and is associated with aging. Treatments for these conditions are generally not very satisfactory. While all these conditions are known to exist in China, very little is known about their disability burden. It is likely already to be significant and to grow rapidly as the population ages and osteoporosis may pose particular problems for aging women. This suggests a priority area for further research and fazt finding by Chinese physicians and epidemiologists.

Chronic disease epidemiology has greatly advanced the understanding of the risk factors for the chronic diseases. In the last few decades much myth and mystique has been removed from the causal factors for heart disease, cancer and some other chronic diseases. There remains much that is not known but the world's understanding of behavioral, social, occupational and environmental factors for the chronic diseases has grown together with the methods by which they may be analyzed. The literature is now vast, and the synergism and shape of risk is complex. There are important shades of meaning in the exact role a given risk can be assigned in differing circumstances: causal factor, effect modifier, confounding factor, extraneous factor. Risks can play any of these roles in different settings, can modify each other, and can operate simultaneously on several disease processes. In addition, some risks may be thought of as diseases (e.g. tobacco, alcoholism). 2. Public and Professional Understanding. Unfortunately, China missed out on much of the world's experience in studying the epidemiology of chronic disease as this coincided in part with the cultural revolution. At the time when epidemiological studies and epidemiology as a professional discipline were making substantial strides in the West, China's universities and social research institutions were closed. Today the scarcity of trained epidemiologist, of strong faculties of public health, epidemiology, and social medicine, present lingering structural weaknesses in China's health system which help explain the lack of attention today paid to prevention of chronic disease in China.)/ Epidemiology is still thought to be largely a microbiological and laboratory-oriented research area. The very important social, behavioral and environmental aspects of disease risk factors and etiology have not yet become popular in most medical schools and epidemiology has not achieved the importance which it deserves as a planning and analytical tool for the health system, both nationally and at the provincial and local levels. 3. Public understanding of the chronic diseases, the perception that the individual is responsible for his own behavioral change, community knowledge of the risks of lifestyles, habits and diets, have all made substantial progress in the West during the last 25 years. Sometimes public opinion was j9/ Chinese physicians and researchers have long been active, however, in research into the etiology and treatment and cure of chronic disease. While these efforts also suffered during the cultural revolution, China is much less behind in its understanding and capacities in regard to this kind of research. Unfortunately, with certain exceptions which are noted later in this report, it is this approach to chronic disease control (often referred to as the \"medical model') which in both China and the West is proving so expensive and has thus raised doubts about its overall benefits in comparison to alternative, more effective health uses for these same funds. -3.2 - ahead of the response of the medical community in seeking changes of physician attitude and institutional approaches. At other times the medical community has found it difficult to get public support and attention to prevention issues which are medically clear. With notable exceptions (for example, Tianjin Municipality's path-breaking programs at large scale community based chronic disease control) China is somewhat behind the West in regard to community understanding and action to reduce chronic disease risks. 4. In some respects, community concerns in the West have worsened tendencies to increase the costs of medical services, for example in the widespread use of sophisticated technology for diagnosis which could be more simply or effectively done. Expenditures for these services have in part been a distraction from the need to pay attention to prevention. To some extent the same phenomena seem to be affecting China, especially in the urban areas where public reaction to increasing chronic diseases mortality is creating strong pressures for more investment in treatment and curative facilities, without a balanced emphasis on prevention. 5. A Review of Risks in China. The following sections examine the key risks which will affect China's health for the next 40 years. These sections are intended to aid discussion. No attempt has been made to systematically review all of the rich literature on these risk factors. The focus of this chapter is on reviewir7 what is known of the risk factors in China and comparisons of the Chi.iese situation, and its potentials, with experience elsewhere in the world. Smoking. 6. Smoking is the single most important risk factor for chronic diseases in the world. In the United States it has been clearly shown to causes more premature death annually than do the combined effects of heroin, cocaine, alcohol, AIDS, fires, homicide, suicide and automobile accidents. It is a cause of and accelerates atherosclerosis, the underlying cause of coronary heart disease. It is known to be a cause of COPD. It is the major cause of lung, larynx, oral cavity, and esophageal cancers and is a contributing factor for development of cancers of the bladder, pancreas, and kidney. There appears to be links to stomach and cervical cancers. It acts synergistically with other risk factors such as elevated blood fat levels, hypertension and sedentary life style to disproportionately increase the risk of illness and death from heart disease for persons exposed to these other risk factors. It is a major factor in fetal mortality and spontaneous abortion, prematurity, subsequent respiratory distress syndrome death, low birth weight and contributes to subsequent infant morbidity. The nicotine in cigarette smoke is a strongly addictive substance. The chemicals in tobacco itself, additives and processes used to adulterate manufactured cigarettes and their papers (to control burning rates, modify flavor, etc.) release in their burning vapors over 4,000 complex chemical substances, many known to be poisonous. These toxins and other pollutants affect the smoker in ways yet only poorly understood and thus imply additional health risks. There is no medically or economically beneficial effect in smoking. Money spent on tobacco purchases would, in its absence, be spent on other, probably less harmful and wasteful, things -it would not be lost to the economy. -3.3 - 7. A Profile of Smokers in China. China's total tobacco and cigarette consumption is already the world's largest!/ -for 1987, an estimated 1,400 billion cigarettes, equivalent to 65 packages of 20 per year for every man, woman and child in China. An estimated 227 million men and 24 million women smoke, each consuming an average of 268 packs per year or 14.7 cigarettes per day. Annex Table 3.1 below shows smoking prevalence by age and sex. Chinese smoking habits coincide with experience elsewhere. Prevalence is higher among men than women. Overall, about 39% of Chinese over age 15 smoked in 1984 (61% of males and 7% of females; over age 20 the rates are 69% of males and 8% of females), one of the highest rates in the world. A small but significant group of young smokers start early (about 5% of both boys and girls start smoking below age 15) and this proportion may be growing rapidly. There is a moderate inverse relationship between smoking prevalence and educational level. The highest proportion of male smokers have started the habit below age twenty (women in their thirties, but this is changing rapidly in urban areas); the highest ptoportion of those who quit smoking do so around age 55. The leading reason for quitting smoking (69%) is because of smoking related illness. Smoking is more prevalent in the richer had and therein it is markedly more prevalent among women -eleven relatively wealthy provinces had female smoking rates well above the average by 1985, up to a maximum of 27% in Tianjin. The fact that the major untapped market segments are the young and females has ;iot escaped the attention of either foreign or domestic tobacco companies.

Chinese and international comparisons for tobacco exposure parameters are shown in Annex Table 3.2 below. Total consumption of cigarettes in China has grown at a high rate -4.2% annually from 952-65; 7.5% from 1965-78; and 9.6% from 1978-87. Overall consumption of manufactured cigarettes continues !i US Department of Health and Human Services (PHS), Office c,n Smoking and health. Smoking, tobacco, and health: A fact book. Rockville, MD, 1986. -3.4 - to rise rapidly and is approaching the levels of countries which are considerably wealthier and known to have suffered hi.gh economic and social costs due to smoking related illnesses. On the other hand, cigarette consumption per adult (over age 15) is still only a little over half the levels in other major countries. Reduction in exposure to tobacco is without a doubt the single most important primary prevention activity which China can take to reduce future morbidity, premature death and disability, needless addiction, pain, suffering and all of the attendant investment and recurrent costs in the health sector and the loss of earnings in productive sectors due to smoking-associated illnesses.

At least three factors inhibit recognition in China of the disastrous effect that smoking will have in the next century. First, manufactured cigarettes have only a relatively recent history of domestic production using sophisticated techniques and materials provided through cooperative arrangements with foreign tobacco companies.! Older Chinese who smoke have been heavy smokers for many years. However, for the population as a whole, the rumber of cigarettes consumed per day has increased; the age at which smoking starts has decreased; and most importantly, the additives in cigarettes have changed as a result of newer technology and a consumer shift to western-style cigarettes. Second, cigarettes are a growing source of financial income to the government, and their increased production and sale appears financially attractive. Finally, the knowledge of both personal and !i Annual Report. R.J. Reynolds Tobacco International, Inc. 1987. p.10. -3.5 - population-wide health effects of smoking has not been widely disseminated in China. In part, this is due to the long delay in the manifestatiwn of smoking-attributable diseases in the population. However, these adverse effects are virtually inevitable, biologically. Smoking and chronic disease experience in Taiwan shows an early glimpse of what a Chinese population may expect to incur. These clearly are not problems affecting only Western populations (Box 3.1). 10. Smoking-attributable Disease ImRact. Peak smoking exposure of the population will determine subsequenL smoking-attributable disease impact. This exposure will have a latency period before the apex of smoking attributable mortality.!/ It is certain that the only recent introduction of manufactured cigarettes and the marketing techniques of the international companies and the domestic monopoly mean that the maximum exposure of Chinese to tobacco has not vet occurred. As a result, the highest mortality imnact from smoking is certainly many years away. with or without concerted prevention efforts. Lung cancer mortality peaks, for instance, can be expected to lag behind the highest exposure to tobacco by three or more decades. Thus, traditional epidemiologic methods for estimating the smoking- attributable disease impact!/ will not adequately portray the smoking- attributable disease burden yet to be experienced. 11. Annex Table 3.3 below shows the smoking attributable proportion of mortality for a variety of chronic diseases in the United States. The epidemiological data by which to develop similar China specific smoking attributable risks &re not yet available. However, clinical and biological evidence from around the world is already enough to state that generally similar smoking attributable risks will be found to apply to China. For some categories, (e.g. lung cancer) China's smoking attributable fraction may today be lower. With longer exposure to smoking, especially to manufactured cigarettes, most attributable risk fractions can be expected to approach the experience of the West. Data from other countries allows a reasonable order- of-magnitude estimation of Chinese future smoking attributable mortality if current trends continue (Annex Box 3.2). 5' Walker and Brin. \"U.S. Lung Cancer Mortality and Declining Cigarette Tobacco Consumption\", J Clinical Epidemiol 1988; 41:179-185. !i Based on population-attributable risk calculations: the population attributable fraction is a function of the prevalence of the risk factor, the observed mortality for risk-factor associated illness, and the relative risk of death due to these illnesses in the population with the risk facto compared to the population without the risk factor.

Whatever the precise number, the sconomic impact of indirect mortality losses, direct medical costs, and indirect morbidity losses will eventually be enormous for China, especially if additional medical procedures such as cardiovascular surgery, major cancer surgery, and radiologic diagnostic and treatment techniques are utilized to treat smoking-related diseases. The trend to use these higher technology interventions is already clear in Chinese hospitals. 13. Present Dg;y Financial Rewards of Tobacco. Government tax revenues from tobacco have nearly trebled between 1980 (RMB 5.73 billion) and 1987 (RMB 17 billion, equivalent to US$ 3.9 billion, or 6.7% of total revenue). Annex Table 3.4 presents a partial picture of tobacco production, productivity, sales and taxes. Tobacco taxes represent an important source of general revenue and, as in other countries, offer a policy lever to both increase revenues and to discourage smnking among specific segments of the population, especially the young and women. As described below, there would appear to be ample impetus for tax authorities to both increase general revenues from tobacco and to decrease overall smoking prevalence. 14. China's complex central-province revenue sharing system provides some powerful incentives for increasing tobacca production by some provinces or municipalities. In general, provinces are obligated to share a percentage of their total revenues (from all sources) with the central government. Poor provinces remit little to the center (e.g. Yunnan, 0%) and relatively rich provinces or municipalities remit high rates (e.g. Shanghai, 70%). The poorest regions benefit from net subsidies from the center of their overall expenditures. -3.8 - Annex Box 3.2 2000,000 Chinese Deaths a Year from Tobacco in the Future The number of Chinese people who will be killed DELAYED DEATHS by cigarettes is much larger than is generally First in Britain before 1920, then in the realized.

The production tax on cigarettes is set by the center at a percentage (60% for the top two grades of cigarettes) of the approved retail sales value of production!/ and is included in the ex-factory price r3 that administration and collection of receipts are simple. The authority to set the rate is vested in the Ninistry of Finance (MOF) and cannot be adjusted by the provinces.. Receipts are collected from cigarette factories by the tax bureau at the relevant level of government and are remitted to the Provincial Finance Bureau, which in turn remits the appropriate share, if any, to the MOF. All 9./ Tax payable -the cost of raw materials + the cost of processing/ 1 - production tax rate. The tax rates for grades A, B, C, D, and E cigarettes are respectively: 60%, 60%, 56%, 50% and 32%. Cigars are taxed at 47% and cut tobacco at 35%. The grading standard is a function of the ex-factory price of a case of cigarettes (1 case contains 50,000 cigarettes) with the ranges as follows: A -Rmb. 1,200 per case and higher; -Rmb D -Rmb. 280-430; E -less than Rob. 280. -3.10 - tobacco producing provinces have an incentive to increase overall output and hence their tax revenues since they are able to retain their marginal share of the incremental output. The incentive to increase output of cigarettes is particularly attractive for two reasons: the tax rate on cigarettes is high and it is mainly the poor provinces (who retain most or all of their tax receipts) which are the main cigarette producers. 16. The totnl revenue accruing to the state from cigarettes includes a variety of income other than the tax on cigarettes. Time series data on these detailed items are not available. However for 1987 the total state revenue from tobacco was composed of the following: Rmb. 12.5 billion cigarette production tax receipts; Rmb 2.5 billion profits from commercial distribution channels for cigarettes; Rmb 0.5 billion tobacco industry profits; Rmb. 1.5 billion income tax receipts from tobacco industry. From total state cigarette income, subsidies totalling about Rmb. 1 billion were given back to the tobacco industry in 1987 to compensate for inflation of raw material costs, to purchase new capital equipment and to compensate for losses due to natural disasters. In addition, interest on debt is deductible from profits before income tax and this has spurred considerable new investment in equipment and capacity expansion. This and othei. expansion incentives have been an added attraction in some cigarette manafacturing joint ventures. Some rebates on taxes paid are also allowed for early repayment of debt. In addition, producing provinces offer a variety of incentives and rebates (of which the center is not necessarily aware) to tobacco factories to help them increase production. 17. There a-e currently 167 cigarette factories within the state monopoly, China National Tobacco Corporation. There is a Si7aable industry of informal and small scale producers outside this framework. Some of these may escape the normal taxation and regulatory system. Prices and taxes have been fixed for some years for the state tobacco monopoly while raw material prices have been increasing.)/ Profitability at the factory level is alleged to be declining. The state tobacco monopoly presents itself as being financially threatened if taxes are increased in this situation because it sees no way to protect itself from substantial underselling and loss of market share to the non-formal sector, both for domestically produced cigarettes and the growing volume of illegally imported cigarettes. 18. Pricing and control of official imports involves two categories of sales. For normal retail sales the commercial price of cigarettes is in theory equal to the sum of (a) the CIF value and 150% import duty thereon plus (b) 60% (equivalent to the production tax rate) of this total. There is also a second category of imports originally intended for sale only to foreigners but now available to anyone w'th Foreign Exchange Certificates. These are imported and distributed through state stores and hotels in cooperation with foreign tobacco companies. The official selling price is the sum of a) the 9/ Cases are reported of factories trying to protect themselves against raw tobacco price increases by engaging in complex barter transactions. For example, factories with transportation capacity or connections have imported rice into Yunnan to barter for tobacco. -3.11 - CIF value and 100% import duty, plus b) 6% tax. Foreign brand cigarettes have high prestige value in China and actual market values are often far in excess of the official prices. This has created strong incentives for illegal resales of the second category of imi'orts and even stronger incentives to .muggling in ports and across the border from Hong Kong. Annex Table 3.4 above shows an estimate for the share of the domestic cigarette market accounted for by legal imports foreign manufactured cigarettes (1.8% by value). The involvement of foreign tobacco companies in China. and tcWacco imports have been growing rapidly as has the trade account deficit attributable to tobacco. The prospect for disruptive marketing tactics, the potential for further market penetration and the adverse health and financial implication for China are considerable (Annex Box 3.3). 19. Despite the worries of the tobacco industry there is ample evidence that the tax rate on cigarettes is far too low. Growth in total consumption of cigarettes (Annex Table 3.2) is robust. In some provinces, the growth in smoking prevalence and demand for high quality cigarettes in particular is such t..at imported cigarettes and some domestic brands effectively function as a second currency and are commonly bartered. Differentials of 400% between official and market prices have created strong incentives to smuggling of imported cigarettes and use of influence to purchase domestic brands at the official price for future retail resale ard profit.!/ 20. In light of this situation the Ministry of Finance realizes that a price and tax increase for cigarettes is needed -to increase state revenue, to protect health. to reduce marketing abuses and Rerhaps to protect the domestic tobacco industry financial position. A number of proposals to accomplish this have been under consideration for some time. The situation is complicated by the fact that cigarette prices are one item included in the consumer price index. An increase in t'ne present tax rate would increase the reported rate of inflation, an already politically s.isitive subject. 21. An increase of the order of magnitude needed to control market abuses and to have a beneficial health impact is likely to be difficult for government to achieve without taking a new approach to taxation. In addition, opponents to an increase in price and taxes (including many tobacco producing provinces) use a number of arguments: !i Two examples of domestically produced, high quality cigarettes illustrate the problem as it existed in 1988. In one case the official price was Rmb. 1.38 per pack and the market price was Rmb 6.0; for the other brand the official orice was Rmb. 1.80 and the market price was Rmb 7. -3.12 - Foreign Tobacco 3anies a 6 Tobacco Trade Trends Tobacco mrkets in the West are decreaing further penetration of forein tobacco at the rate of 1X anually.

Young smokers commonly are spending 15%-25% of their cash income on tobacco and are willing to pay substantial premia for imported brands. -3.14 - Anex Table 3. 5 CHINA TaWI Valus d ErIpod3ud hp 0 Bargosh 0 3O 5 57 so 110 g0 330 70 Hollnd - 22. A substantial increase in state income from cigarettes is overdue. Total state revenues per cigarette have been nearly flat in nominal terms for some years and have declined in real terms (Aimex Chart 3.3). Increased consumer purchasing pover relative to the real price of cigarettes explaLns part of the rapid growth of cigarette consmption in China. Implicit louses to the state from illegal sales, smuggling, and excessive retail mark-ups are added evidence of the need for change. China is also studying the fact that elasticity of demand for cigarettes seems in many countries to be about 0.4 to 0.5. It may be even lower in China, at least for some time. This offers the governrent the opportunity concurrently to increase taxtes and revenues for development, decrease health risks and eventuul illness burdens, and undercut incentives for illegal rarketing.

Smoking OR Health Policiei in China, As in most countries, the government's actions toward the smoking or health issue are paradoxical. Some agencies continue to press for expanded tobacco production and greater efficiency and quality of manufactured cigarette output. The courtship of western technology further illustrates the contradiction between promotiL&A health and encouraging tobacco consumption. Foreign tobacco companies were among the first to take advantage of special economic zones with preferential investment conditions. They are also providing new machinery and technical assistance to farmers and factories for product quality improvement. There will be strong pressures to increase tobacco promotion over the coming years in China. -3.16 - Anmex Chart 3.3 China: Tax Revenue per Cigarette (Domestic Production Only) R0 B per cigarette 0.18 - 0.16 0.14- 0.12 --- Current Prices Constant 1980 Prices 0.1 , A L_ . ._ 1980 1981 1982 1983 1984 1985 1986 tOuc: World Sak Eati 24. Other agencies of government, led by the Hinistry of Public Health, are aware of the dangers presented by smoking. In other countries, notably the U.S., strong, scientifically backed advocacy by the U.S. Department of Health and H-man Services has had a dramatic impact on public understanding and the consumption of tobacco (Annex Box 3.4). In China the MOPH has begun early stages of a similar effort. The government launched its first anti-smoking campaign in the 1978 with warnings of the health hazards of smoking in newspapers, broadcasts and filus. China has a ban on cigarette advertising on television, and in theory there is a ban on advertising in domestic magazines, public posters and point of sale displays. The latter two regulations are not yet vigorously enforced. Smoking is banned on all domestic flights (enforced) and trains and buses (not yet enforced) and in transport terminal waiting areas widely ignored). There are no legal restrictions on tobacco sales to children but smoking is forbidden in schools and plans are being discussed to prohibit smoking for children under 18 years of age. Smoking is widespread among college students and, as in the West a few years ago, students and faculty in medical schools19often set a particularly bad example by being heavy smokers. Smoking is still common among doctors and smoking bans in hospitals are not always enforced. MY~ A survey of students at Zhejiang Medical University found smoking prevalence of 70%. -3.17 - 25. Of all the possible prevention strategies for the chronic diseases the most important by far will be reduction of smoking. In some ways China is already a leader amongst developing countries with the steps which it has already taken to reduce smoking. There is room for more to be done though. Some of these policies will incur opposition from domestic tobacco constituencies (tobacco farmers, cigarette manufacturing plants and the China National Tobacco Corporation and its many stbsidiaries). Policies which might affect access of multi-national tobacco companies to China's market and to joint venture participation are likely to incur strong and sophisticated opposition from the transnational corporations. Experience in other countries indicates that this opposition may be exercised through diplomatic and trade channels, will involve a variety of tactics which have emerged as a pattern elsewhere and will be supported by a wide variety of economic arguments about why tobacco and smoking are good for economic growth, for free trade, for employment, for government, for job creation and so on. 26. Potential Misuse of Economic Anslysis to Justify Pro-Smoking Policies. Advocates of tobacco production often support their position with references to taxes, jobs, agricultural output, etc., which would be lost if smoking is reduced. In analyzing these points, Government should not necessarily try to prove their validity or falseness. In fact, economic and financial analysis may be an inappropriate tool for consideration of the pros and cons of smoking. Clearly, an economy can grow more, and faster, if there is stro - demand for goods and services and if there is a minimum number of dependent, non-productive members of society requiring care or subsidy of some kind. From this perspective the greater the number of people who die promptly upon becoming debilitated or ill, or upon reaching an age of diminished ability to work, the economically better it would be. A health strategy based on an economic premise of this kind would emphasize healthy years of production and medical strategies to allow, or enhance, quick death amongst those who become disabled, seriously ill or reach \"retirement\" age. Smoking and other chronic disease risk factors could, in such a Derverted system, be fine tuned to accomplish this end while at the same time increasing overall production, employment and trade. Such an approach would of course be fundamentally foolish. China should be especially suspicious of economic arguments advanced by Chinese or international tobacco companies to defend the propagation and expansion of smoking as something which is in China's national social or economic interescs. It most clearly is not. 27. In general the government- should expect to be presented by both foreign and domestic tobacco interests with arguments and assertions contrary to suggestions in this report. Economic arguments in particular should be reviewed with care as much of the underlying rc-- oning is often specious. Other arguments may be couched in the guise of free international trade. There may be valuable lessons for China in the recent experience of other Asian societies in their encounters which sttch pressures. The effects on youth in Taiwan to recent liberalization of foreign tobacco company access have been particularly disturbing (refer back to Annex Box 3.3). Chapter 4 contains recommendations of a strategy for China to consider. -3.18 - Annex Box 3.4 Progress in Reducing Smoking in the United States In the United States, cigarette smoking has Smoking control oclicies have played an declined dramatically during the past 25 years. increasingly important role in curbing the prevalence The prevalence of smoking among adults has fallen of smoking.

Hypertenaion or high blood pressure is a major risk factor for several chronic diseases and conditions. It is a pathophysiologic precursor to adverse effects on a variety of bodily organ systems. It contributes to cardiovascular disease, cerebrovascular disease, visual loss. kidney disease, and increases the complications of diabeLas. There appear to be genetic, environmental, and behavioral contributors to developing hypertension itself. Some populations seem to be at increased risk of being hypertensive. Lead, either ingested or inhaled, is felt to contribute to hypertension, particularly in children. Psychosocial stress has been linked to elevated blood pressure and reduction of stress with blood pressure reduction. Obesity and alcohol ingestion are associated with higher blood pressures. Salt ingestion has long been associated with blood pressure, but the exact nature of this relationship remains unclear. 29. Populations with higher average salt intakes tend to have higher blood pressures. Some individuals seem particularly salt sensitive and their elevated blood pressures can be decreased by salt restriction. However, the value of population-wide salt-restricted diets and the level of salt restriction necessary to achieve a desired effect are not established. 30. Hypertension control programs in Western nations are aimed at reducing the environmental and behavioral contributors. Programs of stress reductior. through biofeedback and other techniques are used to lower blood pressure. Persons with high blood pressure are often advised to lower their salt intake, usually by restricting salt added during cooking and at the table, although processed food contributes considerably to total daily salt intake. 31. Individuals with hypertension are advised to lose weight, if overweight, to lower blood pressure. Recommendations to the population at large are to maintain recommended body weight as a means of preventing the development of high blood pressure. 32. Public health programs are usually designed to screen the population at large for persons with undetected elevated blood pressures, advise them of this condition, and urge those identified to obtain medical follow-up to confirm the finding and obtain pharmacologic or other treatment if indicated. Such anti-hypertensive drug therapy can be considered \"secondary prevention\" for hypertension itself as it reduces the risk of vascutlar, renal, and retinal disease. The threshold level of blood pressure considered \"abnormal\" or suitable for treatment has steadily declined over recent years. Current clinical guidelines suggest treatment be initiated for pressures above 140/90 mm Hg. 33. In China, hypertension is a major healt1\u00b1 problem, with almost 8% of over 4 million adults surveyed in 1979-1980 having elevated blood pressures defined as greater than 140/90 mm Hg (Wu et al, Chinese Med J 1987; 95(2):101-108). Rates vary widely between regions with Guangdong having an age-adjusted prevalence rate of 2.4% and Lahsa (Tibet) having an age-adjusted prevalence of 17.8%. -3.20 - 34. Urban populations tend to have higher prevalence of hypertension than rural ones. The rate of hypertension appears to be increasing in some areas of ChirLa with a 50% increase in hyper:ension observed from 1959 to 1979. In some communities, such as Beijing, Tianjin, and Liaoning province, the hypertension rate douabled from 1959 to 1979. The total number of adults with elevated blood pressure in China was thus over 50 million in 1980 and is probably considerably higher now. 35. Studies from Shijingshan Communc in Beijing suggest that community control of hypertension through screening and anti-hypertensive drug therapy led to both a reduction in blood pressure in 65% of participants and over a 5- year period in a 13% reduction in the cardiovascular mortality rate and a 23% reduction in stroke mortality. 36. The contribution of dietary salt intake to hypertension in China has not been established. Dietary salt intake varies greatly in different parts of the country. In Beijing, a 1983 survey found daily salt intake for urban residents to be 14.2 grams and 15.7 grams for rural residents. Salt intakes tends to be higher in the north of China than the south, and the national hypertension screening of 1979-1980 showed higher prevalence of hypertension in the north than the south. U.S. authorities have recommended a daily salt intake of 5-8 grams. 37. The challenge for China in hypertension control is to identify its hypertensive population and lower their blood pressures through dietary change, traditional Chinese medical techniques, and anti-hypertensive pharmaceutical. Broader public health approaches to reducing salt consumption need to be instituted and studied for their efficacy. China is particularly well situated to document these programs and show what is effective and what is ineffective. Diet: 38. The Nationwide Nutrition Survey in 1982 showed that the avc-rage per capita nutrient intake for Chinese were 2085 kcal of energy intake (102% of the recommended daily allowance -RDA) and 67 grams (92% of RDA) of protein, and 49 grams of fat. Among urban residents, fat intake was 68 grams (25% of total energy contribution) and rural residents 49 grams (14.3%).1Y These data indicate that the Chir.ese diet is not substantially deficient on average in either protein or fat. This does not maar. that protein and energy malnutrition does not exist in China. Based on the average energy intake, about 8-10% of the population is estimated to have energy intake lower than the RDA and existence of nutrient inadequacy for poor households and regions is obscured by national average figures. In this context specific programs targeted to poor regions and income groups should probably have priority over strategies aimed at improving national average food availability. 131 Chen Churning, The National Nutrition Survey of China, 1982, Summary, Food and Nutrition, Vol. 12, No. 1 (1986). -3.21 - 39. The recommendations of the Institute of Nutrition and Food Hygiene of the Chinese Academy of Preventive Medicine for 1990 (and 2000) are as follows in kg/capita/year: cereals 170 (132); legumes 12 (18); vegetables 144 (120); meat 18 (24); milk 24 (25); and eggs 6 (10). Based on these recommendations, by 1990 12% of energy will come from protein and 21% from fat. By 2000 it will be 12.3% and 26% respectively.)v 40. There are two reasons why dietary fat consumption is im'ortant: a) it is a major contributor to being overweight and obesity is the only known risk factor for diabetes and is a comp -tating factor for cardiovescular disease; and b) saturated fat consumption directly affects blood cholesterol levels. The level of blood cholesterol is directly proportional to cardiovascular disease risk, even at low and moderate levels and each 1% reduction in serum cholesterol level yields approximately a 3% reduction in coronary heart disease rate. There are no data that would indicate that Chinese people are exempt from this risk. Immigrant studies Chinese confirm the same general cardiovascular risks, especially after some years of exposure to higher saturated fat diets, and in second and third generations. 41. There are no internationally accepted standards of safe-levels of fat intake. Many western experts are now calling for substantial reductions in fat intake as primary prevention against some forms of cancer and against cardiovascular disease. None in the West would argue that high levels of fat consumption would benefit the health of the general population.Y1The U.S. National Institutes of Health currently recommends that the U.S. diet be considerably modified from current levels of fact consumption of nearly 40 % to no more than 30%. Discussions withini NIH and the American Medical Association had concluded that from a good health perspective no more than 20% of total caloric intake should result from fat consumption but this goal was postponed as impractical given the current bich levels of fat consumption in the U.S. 42. Current levels of fat consumption in China are far below Western levels. Fat consumption data for large urban populations are not readily available but small research studies have found markedly higher average levels.A Obesity i' National Nutrition Survey, 1982, Institute of Health, China Center for Preventive Medicine, 1985, p.69, internal publication. .w Levels of protein intake implicit in scne earlier recommendations of Chinese nutritionists and agricultural planners exceeded those recommended by FAO for all countries, including China, and the implicit levels of fat intake were markedly in excess of FAO recommendations. i4' Unpublished data from rr. Tao Shouchi and colleagues at the Cardiovascular Disease Research Institute report that between 25 and 30% of total calories in urban workers of both sexes in Beijing and Guangdong were based on fat, about 40-50% higher than farmers in the same municipalities. A Beijing dietary survey in 1983 showed similar levels of fat consumption, including the higher levels in urban compared to rural areas. -3.22 - has not been a traditional problem in China but is now frequently commertted on by pediatric researchers and by those who deal with the urban middle aged.iY Maintenance of dietary fat to levels which avoid tendencies toward obesity in population will be an important element for health in China's food strategy. The Japanese diet, already rather close to the Chinese diet in many respects, would seem to provide a better developed country model for China to aim for in its food policy rather tean the diet composition which is characteristic of the U.S. and most of Eu,ope. 43. Blood cholesterol levels in the Chinese are believed to have been low historically, but specific time series cholesterol data are not available.ff Currently available information indicates low average cholesterol levels with modest standard deviation in rural populationslY and higher cardiovascular disease risk levels in some urban populations.)\u00a7 Trends remain unclear however and dietary surveys in urban groups provide some cause for concern. In tha small Beijing study, average cholesterol levels appears to have increased 33% from 1983-86 and the proportion of fat intake among the same 8 The Institute of Nutrition and Food Hygiene, CAPM, reported prevalence in 1987 of overweight persons in the Beijing as males (aged 45-59, 22.9%; aged 60-75, 12.9%) and females 60-75, 16.4%). Personal communication from CAPM. - Recent technological advances (inexpensive, dry-chemistry, auto- analyzers) offer China the opportunity to quickly develop much better age and sex specific cholesterol data for different regions, and gradually to develop time series information. This would be a productive subject of research for well-designed, random sample surveys to be undertaken by some of the medical universities or research institutes. XY Junshi Chen, R. Peto, C. Campbell et al, A Preliminary Study of Dietary, Lifestyle, and Mortality Characteristics of 65 Rural Populations in the People's Republic of China. Oxford University, in press. This National Cancer Institute research project found average serum cholesterol levels in 6500 individuals in 65 rural communities, of 127 mg/dl with a standard deviation of 16. in Unpublis.ied data from Dr. Tao Shou-Chi and colleagues at the Cardiovascular Institute show a marked rise (23% in males; 14% in females) in mean serum cholesterol levels among middle age Chinese (30- 59) in Beijing between 1958-59 and 1983-84. The,- data need to be interpreted with caution but the mean levels in j.983/84 had reached 170 mg/dl. Tung, et al, reported substantially greater increases among Shanghai residents between 1958 and 1981 -average levels of 191 mg/dl (males) and 186 mg/dl (females) for 1981. Average levels of well over 200 mg/dl were found among those over age 40. -3.23 - group increased from 30% to almost 35% of total calories. 2! These same surveys have shown improvement in the ratio of saturated: unsaturated fats however, from more than 2.5 in 1983 to about 1:1 in 1986.0' Environmental Risks. 44. The Government has for some years recognized the severe health risks posed by environmental pollution. Large scale efforts in the early 1980s to reduce particulate emissions from heating and power plants have significantly improved air quality in some major cities. Substitution of cooking gas Eor powdered charcoal bricks in other areas have helped to reduce both indoor and outdoor air pollution. These steps should help te reduce the overall risk of respiratory disease and COPD but substantial further efforts remain to be made in almost all areas. 45. The Ministry of Urban and Rural Construction and Environmental Protection has implemented a number of programs to control and reduce major industrial pollution. However, both for major industries and for the very rapidly growing small industries little systematic information is available to allow a reasonable assessment of health risks. Unpublished research by the Chinese Academy of Preventive Medicine (1984-85 with WHO collaboration) gives some indication of the likely severity and magnitude of the problem however. 46. In a sample population of 157,000 small scale industry workers (in about 6200 small industries) in 18 counties scattered across 5 provinces and two municipalities the risk exposures appeared to be considerable: lead dust, 60 times Maximum Allowable Concentration (MAC), lead fumes 81 times MAC and chronic lead poisoning prevalence was 7.7%; mercury concentrations in air of 12 times MAC; prevalence of chronic benzene intoxication ranging from 8.5% to 16%; chromium plating industries were within MAC limits but with 27% of workers showing lesions of nasal mucosa including erosion, ulceration and perforation of nasal septum; silica dust exposures were 42 times MAC with a prevalence of silicosis (determined through radiological examination) of 2.2% on average; small coal mine workers were exposed to dust at 5 times MAC and SY Yao Chong-hua et al, Dietary Survey in Beijing in 1983, Chinese Medical Journal, 98(6): 439-441, 1985, supplemented by unpublished updated information from 1986, courtesy of Beijing Heart Lung and Blood Vessel Center. 2Y If generally true for China this shift may be a desirable trend from a health perspective and would be welcomed by some agricultural producers. The general consensus among nutritionists is that saturated fats (animal fat and some types of vegetable oil, such as coconut oil and red palm oil products) are more important in contributing to high cholesterol levels more than unsaturated fats (e.g. properly processed soy, cotton and ground nut oils). The movement in tht.. ratio (from 2.5 to 1:1) may be indicative of an acceptance of these \"healthier oils\" over the traditional pork lard for use in cooking when there is greater availability of the vegetable oils. -3.24 - showed prevalence of anthracosilicosis of 9.6%; asbestos plant workers were exposed to 24 times MAC and had clinical asbestosis prevalence of 6.7%; noise exposures higher than 90dB were found in 75% of plants with small textile plants having the highest levels of 112dB; prevalence of hearing loss at speech frequencies for workers exposed to 106dB or more was found to average 79%. 47. These levels of risk exposure can be assumed to create eventual emergence of a large burden of morbidity and premature mortality with accompanying economic losses and increased health care costs. The situation is attributable to a number of factors -lack of appreciation of the importance of occupational safety and health, inadequate budgeting and staffing for occupational health services at the local government level, the virtual absence of health education programs (and budgeting therefore) to create recognition of risks and encourage preventive behaviors amongst plant workers and managers. In addition, the sheer number of such enterprises and their relatively unregulated working environment have overwhelmed the effective capacity of health and environmental authorities to deal with the risks.?' In a number of regions coordinated efforts by enlightened health, safety, labor and industry authorities offer some promise of reduction of risk exposure in the workplace. However, this is an area where there is very little epidemiological information however and where no meaningful discussion of policies and strategy can be accomplished until better surveillance data is available. This would appear to be an appropriate subject for major efforts by local governments in the future. This report will not attempt to deal with this issue further or project morbidity and mortality for environmental risks. It would be reasonable however to assume on the basis of other countries' experience that within 10 years the economic losses and the additional costs incurred by the health system on account of these environmental risks are likely to be very substantial. Li/ Township enterprises have grown in number from 1.35 million (with 32 million employees) in 1983 to 15.1 million (with 80 million employees) in 1986. These numbers far exceed the regulatory and inspection capability of the Health and Labor Safety authorities.

China's health strategy will necessarily continue to change in response to needs and demand for services. Three critical factors will determine much of the direction and pace of change for the health system. These are: (a) the aging population profile which will inevitably and rapidly result in many- fold more people living to middle age and beyond, when their chronic disease risk is much larger; (b) lifestyle, dietary, environmental and occupation risk factor exposures which are growing in duration and dose; and (c) the present masking-effects of the long incubation period of the chronic diseases will begin to disappear and strong demands for treatment and cure will emerge. 2. Based on what is known of these three factors, from China and elsewhere, it is possible to estimate the approximate future trends for the main chronic diseases -through the largely inevitable demographic shifts, the fairlv certain effects of continued and increasing exposure to risk factors, and the well-documented incubation characteristics of the chronic diseases. By examination of successful strategies of prevention elsewhere it is also nossible to estimate the effects which China may be able to have on its health status by adoption of preventive measures of similar effectiveness. More crudely it is possible to estimate the direction and approximate changes which can be expected in demand for health care and consequent health care expenditures. These estimates can be made under differing sets of explicit assumptions to show the effect of China's health care strategy remaining what it now is and the changes which could be expected if health strategy is modified to more aggressively aim at prevention of premature death and disability from the chronic diseases. In order to make these estimations, a projection model was developed which permits detailed demographic, risk factor and disease analysis. 3. The main features of the technical approach used in developing this model are discussed in the attachment of this chapter, \"Modeling Future Health Trends and Costs in China.' The model allows calculations of future numbers of deaths, risk factor exposures and analysis of the impact of alternative interventions. Only a small part of the potential of the model has been exploited for the purposes of this section, the focus of which is to provide an indicative picture of likely future epidemiological developments in China and the approximate degree to which these may be affected by health strategy. Assumptions on the probability of death from specific diseases and at specific ages are drawn from the DSP mortality data on which Annex Chapters 1 and 2 of this report are based. Inferences about underlying burdens of morbidity are based on the detailed disease specific discussions in Annex Chapter 2 and on epidemiological experience in other parts of the world. Assumptions concerning exposure to risk factors and likely future trends for these are drawn from the detailed presentations in Annex Chapter 3 and from experience which has emerged in other parts of the world. Very rough approximation of the impact of these changes on costs of health care are drawn from a subsidiary module in the model which is based on hospital cost studies in China commissioned especially for this report and on assumptions about the -4.2 - frequency of treatment episodes. Assumptions on which the impact of preventive measures are for the most part drawn from actual experience elsewhere as this sets a level of perf-rmance which China might feasibly be expected to achieve were its leaders convinced on the necessity to pay attention to the problems discussed here. Details of the main assumptions are given in the attachment at the end of this Annex Chapter. The statistical tables in this annex present selected, s,:mmarized results from the projection model. The model is being provided to the government for use in doing \"what if\" analysis of the impact which changes in health care strategy may entail. The model also would be suitable for some of China's medical universities to use in teaching courses to underline the importance of epidemiology and of careful planning and analysis of strategy and outcomes in the management of China's health sector. As better epidemiological information becomes available the model can be refined and will provide a powerful monitoring and assessment tool as well as an analytical tool for strategy formulation. The model is a general one and can be applied at the provincial and local level, where basic data permit, and can be used for similar analysis in other countries if adequate epidemiological information is available. Findings of the projection model are only summarized here. 4. The present health care system and its approach to providing health services are described in detail in the Main Report and irn Annex Chapters 5- 9. In very simplified terms however, the health system in recent years can be characterized as being oriented mainly to treatment and curative services with relative neglect of public health programs of primary prevention (much as was foreseen in the 1984 Health Sector Study to be a risk resulting from the wholesale shift to a fee-for-service approach as the basis for cost recovery). The present path to health service provision is a natural consequence of two factors -the economic and financial reforms being implemented in China and the orientation and education of many doctors and health workers toward medical-biological approaches to illness care, as opposed to socio-biological approaches to health care. The former approach would generally tend to emphasize diagnosis, treatment and cure. The latter would tend to understanding of disease causes, their relation to community and individual behaviors and risks, and would emphasize primary prevention and the avoidance or postponement of disease onset. In large part the different approaches are those inherent in a medical approach to illness and a Rublic health alproach. Throughout the world these two approaches appear to be most effective when they each broaden and move toward each other to be complementary in their strengths rather than one approach being dominant ir. the health system and absorbing most resources. At the risk of oversimplifying complex considerations, in the balance of this chapter and for the purposes of discussing the epidemiological projections, a continuation of present strategy will be termed as the \"base case\" and is referred to in discussions below as \"without\" adoption of an aggressive preventive strategy. By \"without\" is meant the reasonable expectations for changes in mortality and illness which may be expected given the current status, trends, likely future secular changes, demographic shifts and, most importantly, risk factor changes which affect the Chinese people. \"Rith\" an aggressive 'Rreventive\" strategy means the outcomes which can be expected if China mounts primary (and some secondary) prevention programs which have effects over time roughly equal to the beit that has been experienced on a large scale in other countries which -4.3 - have emphasized preventive programs in the last three decades. While these labels are overly simplistic to describe the complex set of programs and institutions in today's health system, they provide convenient titles to describe the quite different paths, and their effects, which may be followed in the future. They should not be interpreted however to mean that only one path of the medizal apgroach or the public health approach should be followed exclusively. Both need to be pursued in balanced light of a very clearly articulated strategy. Annex Chapters 5-9 and the Main Report deal in detail with the strategic approach required and its elements. 5. The projection model provides a specific picture of the likely course of future mortality for China. The estimates and exact magnitudes discussed in this section should not be interpreted as precise data but as indicators of future health status. They are helpful for identifying areas of priority, for revealing topics where early preventive action may have important long term gains, and absence thereof may have enormous long-run costs. The model and results summarized here are intended to sharpen and focus the ongoing health policy debates in China about the appropriate role of the MOPH, the basic strategy for China and the critical elements to be taken into account. A projection time frame to 2030 was chosen because the deaths arld illness which will be occurring from 2010 to 2030 will be among the million people alive in China today who are now between ages 1 and 44. These deaths will not be hypothetical events but in their magnitude, structure and consequences will create and shape much of chinese society for a century to come. DemograRhic Considerations. 6. China's population profile will inevitably cause, and be characterized in the future by, several large \"waves\" of age groups. All aspects of China's social care system, and especially the hea'lth system, will be inevitably influenced by the shape of China's population profile over time. As these waves of people enter their reproductive years they will create succeeding waves of births and as today's parents and their children age, demand for health care and other social services will be substantially affected. Annex Chart 4.1 shows a three dimensional profile of China's population for the next 40 years. There is a moderate bulge in the age cohorts around 25-30 years old today and a larger bulge at about age 15-20. Over time these bulges will remain and the first will predictably be demanding health care for the chronic diseases as they enter their 50's starting around the year 2010; the second group will create an enormous demand for chronic disease care, rehabilitative medicine and associated services starting about 2025. A third wave will emerge and move through time starting in about 1995-2000 as a result of the earlier wave entering their reproductive years. Increasingly after the year 2000 very large numbers of people will be living into their middle ats and beyond and will constitute a much larger risk pool for chronic illness. 7. A chronic disease prevention strategy will have relatively little effect on the shape and size of these waves -they are inevitable except for occurrence of a disaster of yet unprecedented magnitude in the world. However, as summarized in Annex Table 4.2 below, a chronic disease prevention l o t o (I WoOoog , 'I 0l I-~ 0 e d 0 a Csg\u00a2s t % . 8// A i\u00b0t .-,>p CDI N 0-~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~C -4.5 - strategy can have exceptional effect upon the illness burden that these population waves will present to society and upon the capacity of society to sustain the illness burden. The \"without\" projection shows that the number of healthy people in society will begin to decline (Annex Table 4.3, Column 1), mortality rates will increase about 50% by 2010 and will more than double by 2030 with much of the increased death being among the middle aged (Annex Table 4.2). \"Without\" a change of strategy will see probability of survival to tbe end of middle age (65) declining to 75% (2010) and 70% (2030) (see Annex Table 4.5, section 1, for details). 8. \"With\" a preventive strategy mortality rates will increase slowly by about 30% by 2010 and about 75% by 2030 (compared to 1986) but with most of the increased death rates being attributable to the elderly rather than the middle ages. The probability of survival to the end of middle age will rise from today's 77%, to 79% (2030). Life expectancy will increase slowly by about 1.2 years (to age 72) by 203O. 'With\" a preventive strategy China may be able to avoid by 2010 about 1.2 million premature deaths annually and by 2030 about 3.4 million annual premature deaths. As a result, China's population size will increase by about 33 million by 2010 and 64 million by 2030. The differences in these \"with\" and \"without\" trends and the relative shifts will have an enormous impact on the lives of persons under age 45 in China today. 9. The increased population size will be a \"one-time\" effect of adopting a preventive strategy and will not feedback into the population growth rate as most lives saved will be people who are no longer in their reproductive years. It should be clear, though, that implementation of a preventive strategy has important demographic implications which spill over into areas of social security and dependency. 10. ERidemiological Imnact. The rates of all the chronic diseases in China will increase in the future for the three reasons cited at the start of this chapter -- the demographic transition, increasing risk factor exposures, and disappearance of the masking effect of the long incubation period. Annex Table 4.4 shows the rates which are expected to develop for the leading causes of death, with and without adoption of a preventive strategy. The most dramatic increases in rates will be for l'ng cancer, chronic obstructive lung disease, coronary heart disease, stroke, injuries and the broad category of all other diseases. The last category includes some infectious diseases (e.g. pneumonia and TB) and other gastric, endocrine, neurological, and renal diseases which particularly are causes of death amongst the elderly and about which little can be done at advanced ages. The rates for this category increase \"with\" a preventive strategy primarily because very elderly people (80 years and over) are not dying sooner of other causes (see also Annex Table 4.5, section 19). All life expectancy calculations here assume that infant mortality rates (IMR's) are held constant during the projection period so that the impact of disease prevention during adult life can be seen. In reality life expectancy will be considerably higher if IMRs' continue to decline as they should. -4.6 - nxte.

More importantly, \"with\" prevention the deaths from chronic disease will be occurring much more amongst the elderly, and less amongst those still in middle age. The most significant of the changes will occur among the five leading causes of death (see Annex Table 4.4). Priorities and the need for preventive strategies focussing on these diseases emerge from more detailed analysis of the trends involved in each. These trends are difficult to see in numerical form and to summarize in words h,owever. For each of the five main diseases, the charts below easily allow the main features of the epidemiological changes of preventive strategies to be seen. 12. Lung Cancer. Without a shift to a preventive approach China can expect its health system, its industry, labor force and social institutions to have to bear an annual burden of more than 3 million cancer deaths by 2030 (Annex Table 4.3). Lung cancer is by far the most important of these (see also Annex Table 4.6), accounting for almost two-thirds of this number -equal to more than 6 times the number of cancer deaths which the United States currently has to cope with. Twenty percent of total cancer deaths annually may be avoidable. Most of these will be lung cancer and it is by far the most important cancer to focus on because it is susceptible to primary prevention efforts. In addition, about half of all lung cancer deaths avoided will be amongst persons aged 50-69 years old, implying large avoidance of economic losses. The top frame of Annex Chart 4.2 shows the age specific numbers of deaths over time which can be expected without a preventive strategy. The second frame shows the age specific lives saved annually over time with a preventive approach and the bottom frame shows the potential years of life Anr.ex Chart 4.2 Vertical Scale in P:.::cSira:tX;::-1e:: Pnc .cS, OM 10~~~~~ ,)s~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~.

For lung cancer the salient features are that the future epidemic of cancer is still some years away; the numbers of deaths annually will make earlier epidemics due to infectious diseases seem sm_ll by comparison; many deaths will occur amongst persons in the prime of their lives. The potential for saving lives is great and many of those saved will be in their critical productive years. Potential years of life saved before retirement age become iarge after 2010 and will be very much larger in years after the projection time frxume. No other leading cancer in China is as preventable and has such a substantial impact on the structure of future society and productivity as lung cancer. Primary prevention methods are simply the reduction of cigarette smoking (see Annex Table 4.7 for data on the smoking population, prevalence and projections). 13. Chronic obstructive lung disease (Cor Pulmonale) may account for an additional three million deaths annually by 2030 (and perhaps 30 million ill and partially disabled persons). With vigorous efforts 25% or more of this death and disability may be avoided. About hi9lf of deaths avoided will be amongst people under age 65, as will almost all morbidity and disablement avoided. The impact of prevention efforts is visible (Annex Chart 4.3, middle frame) much earlier than it is for lung cancer because cessation of smoking (and perhaps of exposure to air pollution) has immediate benefits for those already ill with the disease and can completely avoid onset of the disease in those who have not yet been long enough exposed to the risk factors. The impact on younger middle age groups is substantial in terms of potential years of life saved. The main prevenziion effort will also be the reduction of cigarette smoking. 14. Coronary Heart Disease. Heart disease of various types will account for another 1.7 million deaths annually and much underlying morbidity and disability (Annex Table 4.3). Even for those forms of heart disease for which new cases are now becoming relatively uncommon (rheumatic heart disease) the burden of illness will be large because of the large cohorts in the current population who have incurred rheumatic heart disease during their younger years (see Annex Table 4.5, section 12, for age-specific breakdowns). However, coronary heart disease is likely to account for more than half of all future heart disease deaths (perhaps 800,000 annually by 2030) and will adversely affect many Chinese still in middle-age. \"With\" a prevention strategy there may be nearly as many coronary heart disease deaths (Annex Tables 4.6 and 4.5, section 13), but these will be occurring mainly in those over 70 years of age. The middle frame of Annex Chart 4.4 shows the number of lives saved becoming \"negative\" indicating that above age 75 there are more persons dying from coronary heart disease with a preventive approach. This occurs because these persons are not dying earlier from other causes and because coronary heart disease deaths rates accelerate sharply with age. The bottom frame of Chart 4.4 makes clearly visible the enormous saving of premature death and disability among those still in middle age. 15. Stroke will remain a major killer in China's future, especially because stroke rates are much higher at an older age (Annex Chart 4.5). About 3 million stroke deaths annually may occur by 2030. On the assumption that China can emulate the best preventive experience elsewhere, projections show that large numbers of these deaths may be averted but more than half of these .4 : /4 l \\ ~~\\ /.. A. i . . .[rtlet ~ ~ I, /1\\e. Annufl N~ br xKi ad vtth'\\\\y1 N crtical Scales -4.12 - will be among the elderly (70+) and they may die within a year or two, whether from stroke or other causes (Annex Table 4.5 section 19). The intensive rates of patient contact which underlie the assumptions, the accompanying high cosLs of medical care, the advanced age of most of the patients, and the unpleasant side-effects of some drug therapies, all mediate against the wisdom of aiming to emulate such sharp reductions in stroke death across all age groups. A strategy stressing stoke avoidance in middle age, cost-effective avoidance of stroke recurrence and afforlable rehabilitative care for all ages may be more suitable. The large savings of potential years of life (bottom frame) underpin the need to concentrate on the younger and middle age groups with any stroke prevention strategy. 16. Iniuries also will be enormously important. If current rates and their trends are allowed to continue about 1.4 million people may prematurely die of injuries and poisoning by 2010 and perhaps 2.5 million by 2030 (Annex Table 4.5, section 18). The top frame of Annex Chart 4.6 shows this clearly. It and the lower frames also show the impact of the large population waves more clearly that do the other disease charts. Because of the age structure of those who are most frequently injured (see Annex Chapter 2), these deaths are especially important to avoid. The associated numbers of persons who will be injured but not die are also very important because of costly treatment, economic losses and often life-long disabilities. \"With\" a preventive approach the model estimates that more than 500,000 injury deaths may be avoided annually by 2010 and about 1.7 million by 2030. Injuries also present one of the areas where preventive programs can be expected to have their earliest effect because there is not necessarily a long lag time for disease manifestation as there is for most chronic disease. This and the huge impact upon potential years of life saved adds to the importance of injury avoidance programs being high on any health strategy. 17. Projectio,ns of a number of other disease conditions and of total deaths is also provided by the model (see Annex Tables 4.3 and 4.5). By comparison to the main causes of future death mentioned above all other individual causes of death will be relatively less important, from two perspectives. First, the absolute amount of death attributable to any single cause will oe far less. Second, the potential for preventive strategies to significantlh reduce death and disability from any of these other single causes is either niot clear, or simply not possible, given present medical and risk factor knowledge. The above causes of death are both absolutely more important to focus preventive strategy upon and relatively more susceptible to make significant differences upon the nation's health status. Urban:rural, gender and age specific details and their tmpact on priority and strategy is shown in Annex Tables 4.6. INI '' I4\\ ;nf -~~~~~~~~~\\i -4.14 MODELING FUTURE EEALTH TRENDS AND COSTS I. INTRODUCTION 18. The purpose of this attachment is to describe the mathematical model used to estimate health trends and costs in China. Models are not meant to predict exactly the future, often they do not even make very good approximations of the future. In fact many examples may be produced in support of the notion that mathematical-models can be very misleading as regards the future. However, if they are taken with a degree of skepticism, mathematical models can provide the researcher or policy scientist useful infcrmatior. for planning. Thin information can be in the fo-rm of \"art order of magnittude' estimate of the fut-ure trends, relationships between various health risk factors, or outcomes of various scenarios of health intervention or treatment. 19. The various components that go into the mathematical model must be carefully assessed to evaluate the viability of the modeling effort. The principle components are as follows: a. The degree to which the data are representative of the current and past health trends must be assessed. In the model for this report, data from several different sources were used. Extrapolation of these data to various patterns in the future provide the basis for forecasting future health status. b. The complex relationships between risk factors such as smoking and various diseases such as heart disease, lung disease, and cancer must be simultaneously incorporated by the model. c. The simultaneous action of various risk factors on morbidity and mortality must be included. For example, changes in demographic profile, number of smokers, diet and so forth may occur simultaneously. The effects of each of these factors must be accounted for individually. d. The model must have some temporal process or method of forecasting future patterns based on current input. 20. A compartment model, or Markov type model, of intermediate \"risk factor states\" and terminal \"death states\" provides the flexibility of addressing the modelling questions above and at the same time provides a pedagogical schematic of the risk factor-mortality process.t In the next section a generic compartment is described. The subsequent section describes how the model was modified to provide the forecasts for China's health and mortality trends. This forecast is referred to as the \"baseline case.\" The method of modelling interventions or \"what if\" scenarios is then presented. An intervention case is described. It is compared with the baseline case. The methods of using currently available data to estimate the initial input parameters are also described. Although this input parameters section presents methodology essential to calculating input parameters for the model, it is not part of the -4.15 - model. As more extensive mortality and morbidity data become available in China, these methods of estimating input parameters will not be necessary. II. THE COMPARTMENT MODEL 21. A generic example of a compartment model is given in Figure I. In this figure various risk factor and death states are represented as boxes. Each individual in society is modeled by placing him/her in the box corresponding to his/her risk factor group. An individual falling into any box can \"transition\" to any other box for which there is a directed arrow linking the boxes. Such a transition represents a change in the risk factor or health state of the individual. The probability of making a transition from box i (state i) to box j (state j) during a period of time, say, one year, is denoted p;. Two assumptions are important in this model. ASSUMPTION 1: The probability, p1, that an individual will transition from state i to state j is independent of any risk states the individual was in previously. ASSUMPTION 2: The probabilities pq are independent of time in the state i. 22. Assumption 1 states that the probability of transition depends only on the current state and not on how the individual got there. For example, if a person is in the hypertensive state and transitions to another risk factor state, his previous existence in the hypertensive state is assumed to have no effect on his mortality outcome. Naturally this assumption seems severe at first. However, if the secondary risk factor state to which the individual transitioned into is a combination of hypertension with some other risk factor, then the ass\u00b6mption seems plausible. In general, the assumption can usually be satisfied by appropriately defining the risk factor states as combinations of risk factors. 23. Assumption 2 states that the probability of transition out of a state is independent of the time in the state. This second assumption can be relaxed somewhat by creatirng a series of states for a particular risk factor, each state represe.-ting a longer time with the risk factor. Figure I Schematic of a generic compartment model for modelling and predicting efficacy and effectiveness. STATE1 *STATE 2 _ STATE K .DEATH ~ DEIH DEATH...DEISTAIE1 ~STATE 2 STATE K -4.16 - 24. The compartment model adjusts for changes in population or changes in risk factor distribution by focusing attention on the transition probabilities. As the demographic or risk factor distributions change in a population, the number of \"counts\" (persons) in each box also changes over time. The compartment model automatically adjusts for these changes in all of the predictions. 25. As a simple example of a compartment model consider the example given in Figure II. This example considers only two risk factcr states and two mortality states. The two risk factor states are the \"well' state and the 'smoking\" state. The two mortality states are deatl by lung cancer and death by other causes. The parameters p4 indicate probabilities of transition from state to state in a one year period. These transition probabilities may be made functions of age of the individuals (i.e., the schematic in Figure I1 is reproduced for each age group). Transitions would then be to a state representing an older age group, in addition to possibly a different smoking or mortality state. Note that as the number of risk factors is increased in this simple example, there will be an increasing number of boxes and lines with each state defined, resulting in a very busy schematic. Conceptually, however, the model is easy to construct. 26. To forecast the mortality pattern over time, we first define the matrix giving all of the transition probabilities and the vector giving the current number of individuals in each risk factor state. The future expected mortality patterns are then calculated by \"turning the crank\" -(moving each in&vidual through the various boxes over time according to the transition probabilities). As shown below, these computations are straight forward with a computer, although often the number of calculations is quite large. Figure II Schematic of a simple compartment modsl representing the smoking example of section II. P21 INO SMOI 24 - 27. Many follow-up studies and clinical trials are designed to measure the values of pq, or how clinical treatment can change these values. For the smoking example see Schwartz (1987) for references. Only occasionally are the results of these studies integrated into a single model to measure overall effectiveness (see e.g. Weinstein et al 1987, Manton, et al 1986, 1988, Tolley and Manton, 1988). III. NOTATION AND RESULTS FOR THE COMPARTMENT MODEL 28, In this section the notation and results of the compartment model are presented more formally. Etrst we define tbe followir.g: t -Time index measured in discrete intervals (e.g. years). Time t is ofteni used to index years since the beginning of some intervention. pq -probability of transitioning from state i to state j during a year given that an individual is in state i at the beginning of the year. Ni(t) -number of individuals in state i at time t. K -total number of risk factor states. L -total number of causes of death states. J -total number of states -K + L. N(t) -total number of individuals alive at the beginning of age t. 29. In these definitions we have not explicitly included age. If age is a risk factor for transition it can be included implicitly by defining the risk factor states to include age. For example, state io might be \"age 30 to 35, smoked 5 to 10 years.\" Since the health effects usually change slowly over time, such groupings provide an adequate approximation. 30. Define the transition matrix P(t) as P(t) -(Pq) Define the vector N(t) -(Nl (t), N2 (t), ...NJ (t)) as the vector giving the number of individuals in each state at time t. If t -0, N(O) is the vector giving the number of individuals who are in each of the states at the time zero. Assuming no new entrants into the system between time 0, and time t, then N(t) is simply calculated as t N(t) -N(O) .II P(n). n-l -4.18 - To include new entrants, equation (1) is modified to be a sum over time, each entry in the summand being of the same form as above. 31. The number of individuals, N(t), in each state at time (t) is the basis for all of our analysis. For example, if one wishes simply to forecast the future mortality profile, the values of N(t) corresponding to the various death states are examined. On the other hand, if one wishes to estimate the costs of medical care for the future, one can use the mortality pattern as an indicator of the quantity and type of medical care service that will be needed. Multiplying the costs for this service by the values in N(t), one can forecast future health care costs. 32. To predict the effect of an intervention over time, the va;.ues of the transition probabilities are years after che intervention. \"Turning the crank\" on the model will then produce the numbers of individuals in each risk factor and mortality state over time under the assumption that the intervention was, in fact, effective. IV. THE CHINA COMPARTMENT MODEL 33. The compartment model for China is made up of four sub-models, one for each male-female/urban-rural combination. For each of these combinations, individuals are classified into one of the five-year age groups up to age 85 and older (18 age groups). Individuals are also classified by length of time they have smoked in five-year groups up to 50 years (10 smoking classifications) or duration of smoking \"cessation states\" in 5 year duration periods up to 50 years (10 cessation classifications). There are 21 smoking classifications including one for \"never smoked.\" This results in 378 classification states (18 age groups times 21 smoking groups). For each of these groups an individual is further classified into one of four states: high cholesterol (blood serum over 200), hypertensive (WHO classification), both high cholesterol and hypertensive or neither. The risk factor boxes for the compartment are then defined by these three classification groups. The result is that there are 1512 risk factor states (18 times 21 times 4). For example there is a risk factor box for individuals between 45 and 49 years old who have smoked for 15 years and then quit smoking who have both hypertension and high cholesterol. 34. Using the results of Peto (see below) it was not necessary to maintain information on when people ceased smoking. Only their age group and the number of years they have smoked to date is required. Similarly, it is not necessary to maintain information on how long the individual has been hypertensive or with high cholesterol. These observations greatly reduced the number of risk factor states that were necessary. Note also that it is unlikely, for example, that any individual will be in the risk factor state corresponding to the \"5-9 age group, smoked 10 years, and have quit.\" In other words, not all boxes are possible to get into. The reason for constructing these boxes is that the formulas are easier to implement computationally by including these risk factor boxes with zero likelihood of occurring. 4.19 - 35. There are fifteen mortality or ct.uses of death states used in the model. This number could be substanttally expanded if adequate epidemiological information were available. the death states used are given in the table below. An individuals in any ot the 1512 risk factor boxes can transition into one of these causes of death in any year. Naturally, as explained previously, the probability of transitioning into any mortality box depends on which risk factor box the individual is in previous to the death. List of the Mortality or Causes of Death States (boxes) and the Chinese Mortality Code Associated with Each Cause of Death Causes of Death Chinese Disease Codes Cervical Cancer 22 Lung Cancer 20 Stomach Cancer Liver Cancer 19 Esophageal Cancer 16 All other Cancers 15, 18, 21, 23, 24 Cor Pulmonale 36 Rheumatic Heart Disease 33 Coronary Heart Disease 34 Hypertensive Heart Disease 35 Other Heart Disease 37, 38 Stroke 39 Infectious Disease 2 All Other Disease (all other codes) 36. In addition to the transitions from one state to another (from one risk factor box to another or from a risk factor box to a death box), the model includes the opportunity for individuals to transition from rural to urban living conditions with accompanying change in some relative risks and in some probabilities of death. This is because some mortality and risk factor patterns for each of these areas are different. As individuals move into the urban setting their exposure to risks and their potential for health care change. To model this effect, individuals whose environment change are assumed to transition from one compartment model to another. Thus, in effect, the compartment model for urban and rural individuals are really different pieces of a larger model where urban-rural status is used in defining the health states. The probability of transitioning to the urban sub-model from the rural sub-model is calculated using the migration rates reported by Banister (Urban-Rural Population Projections for China, U.S. Bureau of the Census, DIR Staff Paper No. 15) from 1985 to 2000. These rates were assumed to apply equally across all age groups and both sexes. The annual rates after the year 2000 were assumed to be a constant value equal to the year 2000 annual rate estimated by Banister. 37. From the model described above, one can forecast mortality patterns for any birth cohort, male or female, by placing them in the \"well, no smoking, -4.20 - 37. From the model described above, one can forecast mortality patterns for any birth cohort, male or female, by placing them in the \"well, no smoking, 0-4 years old, urban or rural\" state and \"turning the crank\" on the model. This will yield the number of deatbs at each age and for each cause of death over time. Naturally, before this can be implemented, values for the probability of transition from one state to the next during a year must be determined. Methods of estimating these values are described below, and are based on detailed current and past data. The resulting estimates are interpreted as current transition probabilities. In addition to the transition probabilities, we must determine the number of individuals initially in each of the risk factor and age \"states\" from previous birth cohorts. It is relatively simple to determine how many individuals are in each age cohort and who are alive. However, we must also specify how manv have smoked a certain number of vears, how many have quit smoking, how many are hypertensive and so forth. ile broad outline of how this was done is also presented below. V. THE BASELINE AND INTERVENTION AGGRESSIVE CASES 38. Not all of the transition probabilities will remain at their 1985 estimated levels. The mortality rates for many of the diseases will change over time as secular trends occur and as risk factor exposure increases or decreases. Similarly the rates of risk factor exposure will change. The rates at which the probabilities change are described here. There are two different scenarios posited. These are referred to as the \"baseline\" case, and the \"aggressive prevention\" case. The baseline case refers to the time changes of the transition probabilities if the current trends in China persist and, if broad secular trends in disease rates in China change as they have elsewhere with the level of economic development. These assumptions are elaborated below. The aggressive prevention case is the scenario which might result from changes in China's health strategy. The strategy changes entail reduced smoking, improved diet, and decreases in accident rates. Each of these scenarios are detailed by the various diseases they affect as follows: 1. SMOKING Base line: Men are assumed to increase in starting rate of smokirg for 15-20 year olds at 10.0% per year from 1985-1995 and remain constant thereafter, while women are assumed to increase in starting rate for 15-35 year olds at 11.6% per year from 1985-2005 and remain constant thereafter. To account for low incomes in many rural areas of China, these conservative rates have been chosen to reflect long-term smoking changes among youth as experienced elsewhere. The resulting projected increase in smoking prevalence in young age groups is far less than actually being experienced in urban areas of China and in most of Asia. Patterns assumed for women reflect experience in a number of other countries. Aggressive: Men quit smoking at a constant 3.4% per year from 1995-2030 and decrease in starting rate 3.4% per year from 1995-2015 and remain constant thereafter, while women quit smoking at a constant 2.0% per year from 1995-2030 and decrease in starting rate 2.0% per year from 1995-2015 and remain constant thereafter. This is roughly equivalent to the annual -4.21 - decrease experienced among men in the U.S. and is more optimistic for experience among women than achieved elsewhere. 2. HYPERTENSION Baseline: Hypertension prevalence and onset age is assumed to just continue at current levels and patterns except that the probability of transition from hypertensive to non-hypertension state in a year is assumed at 0.5% to account for gradual spread of knowledge of hypertension risk and behavioral/medical treatment changes -o achieve a small long-term downward trend as has been experienced elsewhere. Aggressive: Prevalence and onset assumed to continue as at current levels except that the probability of transition from hypertension to non- hypertension state in a year is 3.4% for years 1990-2010 equivalent to long-term annual rates of reduction achieved in the U.S. Thereafter changes are assumed as in the baseline case. This implies that during the first 20 year period China would adopt preventive/therapeutic measures sufficient to reduce hypertension among all those person who could be easily and effectively reached and that further reduction would be more difficult to achieve. 3. HIGH CHOLESTEROL Baseline: Both men and women in the urban areas are assumed t. remain at current levels of prevalence and age distribution and levels of onset. For all ages where average levels are 200 mg/dl or higher the model estimates their relative risk of coronary heart disease at twice the prevailing mortality rate from CHD for non-hypercholesteremic persons in that age group. Rural rates of prevalence of hypercholesterol are assumed to increase from current low levels such that by the year 2000 the rural rates are equal to today's moderate urban rates. These are in line with both the limited China-specific evidence that is currently available and by experience in England and the U.S. when incomes increase substantially over many years. These are very conservative assumptions implying only slow change in the Chinese diet toward greater consumption of saturated (animal) fats. Aggressive: Both men and women are assumed to experience a 4.0% per year reduction from the baseline in numbers of those entering the high cholesterol state from 1985-2030. This assumes active health education and patient management programs for those at risk, similar to those conducted in the West in the last decade. 4. CANCER OF THE STOMACH AND ESOPHAGUS Base line: For stomach cancer, both men and women are assumed to experience a 2.5% reduction in the rate of mortality from stomach cancer from 1985-2030. Both men and women who are nonsmokers are assumed to experience a 2.5% per year reduction in the rate of mortality from esophageal cancer from 1985-2030. These assumptions correspond with long term secular trends observed worldwide. No effective primary, secondary or -4.22 - tertiary prevention strategies are known to exist for stomach cancer. Only avoidance of cigarette smoking is known to be an effective primary prevention measure for esophageal cancer. No secondary prevention or curative treatment is effective. Aggressive: Same assumptions as base line. 5. CANCER OF THE CERVIX Base line: Current age-specific death rates are assumed to continue for this cause of death. This is a moderate assumption in that the primary risk factors for cervical cancer entail behaviors which may change markedly over coming years in China. Aggressive: Women are assumed to experience a 3.0% per year reduction in death rate from this cause from 1995-2015, with rates remaining constant thereafter. This performance would equal the best rates of reduction achieved in the U.S. and in control groups in China over about a decade. It would require carefully designed screening programs for women at risk, health education for all women and efficiently structured treatment programs. 6. RHEUMATIC HEART DISEASE Base line: Age specific mortality rates for both men and women are assumed to continue at current levels. This iLplies that current deterioration in access to primary care among the urban and rural poor and uninsured, continued low laboratory quality and efficiency and less than fully appropriate use of antibiotics continues because of financial pressures in the health sector and lack of adequate retraining programs for many doctors. Aggressive: Neither men nor women under 25 years old as of 1985 are assumed to ever experience a death rate from this cause higher than 5 per 100,000. This implies that for age cohorts over 25 years old today, risk following from infections earlier in life will follow them through time. For younger age groups, access to better primary care thus far are assumed to continue and to result in fewer per_ons at risk because of fewer rheumatic fever episodes. The base rate assumed will imply very good access to primary care, unimpeded by considerations of cost for the rural and urban poor and rather good retraining programs for many doctors in order that they appropriately deal early and correctly with potential cases of streptococcus infection. 7. STROKE Base line: Age specific mortality rates for both men and women are assumed to continue at current levels. Prevalence of hypertension is the main risk factor. Smoking rates are known to moderately increase stroke risk amongst those in middle age but not old age but this variable has not been demonstrated in China and has not been included in the model. -4.23 - Aggressive: Age specific death rates for both men and women are assumed to experience a 4.0% per year reduction from 1985-2030. The assumed annual rate of reduction is equivalent to that achieved in the U.S. over a 30 year period. The remarkable declines in stroke death in the U.S. are not fully understood. Parts of the performance must be attributable to declines in smoking, dietary changes, public education of danger signs and risk factors, better physician awareness and treatment practices, the availability of better anti-hypertensive drugs and patient management protocols, improved emergency treatment protocols and availability but we cannot separately attribute shares of causality. China should be able to immediately benefit from therapeutic advances known to work elsewhere as rapidly as these can be diffused in the Chinese health care system. Patient and physician education can also be expected to be rapidly diffused in the Chinese system if present budgetary constraints and financial pressures which are skewing the system away from preventive concerns can be alleviated. Very recent advances in therapy, such as the prophylactic use of low doses of aspirin and anti-hypertensives, can also be diffused rapidly in China after simple, large-scale randomized trials for testing. Emergency service protocols and access can be expected to improve rapidly in urban and peri-urban areas. Decisions to aggressively promote health education to bring about dietary shifts and smoking prevalence reductions can be expected to be at least partially effective in the short run and, if sustained, have a major long-term impact. Rapid, widespread diffusion and considerable improvement in access to care which would have to underlay all of these factors will, however, require considerable changes in direction and in financing patterns for health care and these may be more difficult to achieve. Overall, it seems reasonable to think that if China makes the determined political decision to tackle its high death rates from stroke that its performance could be as good as the long term experience achieved elsewhere. However, stroke presents an extremely complex set of demands for a combination of the right balance of primary and secondary prevention and effective tertiary care and the age structures which the disease affects call for very careful strategy development. 8. INJURY Base line: Age specific mortality rates for both men and women experience a 4.0% per year increase from their present patterns from 1985-2000 and a 2.0% per year increase from 2000-2030. It is unlikely that injury prevention investments, regulations, and education programs can be put sufficiently in place during the next few years to substantially slow the current rapid growth of injury deaths which is accompanying China's development achievements. It is also unlikely that China's leaders will tolerate the huge burden of carnage and loss which injuries will present to the economy within only a few more years and we therefore estimate that at least partially effective programs will be put in place to halve the rate of increase by the end of the century. Aggressive: Both men and women are assumed to experience a 4.0% per year increase in age specific death rates from this cause from 2000-2000 followed by a 2.3% per year decrease from 2000-2030. The rationale for this pattern is that by the end of the century a fairly active, -4.24 - of programs equal the best sustained performance which has been achieved elsewhere (approximately the rate achieved in injury fatality reduction, all causes, in the U.S. from 1970-84). VI. CALCULATION OF COSTS 39. To estimate costs of future health care in China it was assumed that for each death there will be an associated medical care average cost. Of course, medical care costs are not made up only of costs associated with mortality but also include morbidity costs. Total costs of health are estimated by assuming that for each death there are a number of individuals with the same disease who receive medical care aho do not die from that episode of iliness. Therefore, when calculating costs, each death by a specific cause must be increased by a factor representing the number of other individuals receiving care who do not die. The multiplicative factors for each cause of death are given in Annex Table 4.4. Note that conservative factors which probably tend to underestimate the total costs have been chosen. 40. In addition to the morbidity factors, costs are determined by the cost per case for each type of disease. There are two different sets of disease specific treatment costs used for the model. The first of these was based on a study of a medium hospital in Shanghai typical of an urban \"district\" level hospital, or a large, rural county hospital (cost A). The second cost is the average of the cost of the 300-bed, medium-sized hospital and a large, 850 hospital typical of those found in most urban areas, large prefectures and provincial capitals in China (cost B). The average disease-specific costs are also included in the table below. In calculating future health costs, each disease specific death cost is increased by the factor described above and then multiplied by the number of deaths of that cause for each year. All base costs are expressed in per capita, 1985 Rmb and projections of total future costs are thus expressed in constant prices. This allows calculation of health cost growth rates relative to general growth and allows rough estimation of whether and by how much health costs will grow faster than GNP. Note that these costs assume that all factor costs and treatment strategies, technology, etc. remain fixed. Thus the model only accounts for costs attributable to the demographic and epidemiological changes which are projected. 41. Since the concept of the multiplicative factors may be new, they are easier to understand if they are considered in the context of average number of treatments before death. For example, the factor for lung cancer is 1. This means that on the average each lung cancer patient received one medical care treatment episode (costing Rmb.707 under conditions prevailing at hospital type A) prior to death by lung cancer. On the other hand, since the factor for coronary heart disease is 2, this means that on the average each individual dying of a coronary condition received 2 health care treatment episodes (costing about Rmb. 267 per visit, hospital type A) prior to death. The factor of 1.5 means that on the average individual will receive 1.5 health care treatment episodes before succumbing to the particular cause of death. Implications flowing from the use of even this simple approach to costing are discussed in the main report. -4.25 - ractor Values and the Two Different Costs for Each Cause of Death.

In order to use the model, we must calculate the transition probabilities Pq for each pair of states i and J. The principle data set is the 1986 DSP data provided by the Chinese Academy of Preventive Medicine. These data include cause of death for about ten million individuals under surveillance in 71 sites. The data are recorded using the Chinese coding for mortality and is carefully verified. In addition to this data, the World Health Organization MONICA study for China on hypertension, the Beijing Iron and Steel Workers Study on cardiovascular disease, the 1984 China Smoking Prevalence Study, and several small scale blood cholesterol studies were used to determine the parameters of the model. In this section, we describe the steps by which these data were used to estimate the transition probabilities. SMOKING 43. The probabilities of tra-sitioning from the smoking states to death by lung cancer was assumed to follow approximate probabilities as determined by Richard Peto to apply across average smoking populations worldwide over long periods of time. Explicitly, Pu -1011*a4*y4, where the J refers to the death by lung cancer state, and i refers to the age and number of years smoked state. The parameter \"a\" is the age of the individual and \"y\" is the number of years smoked. This formula is approximately adjusted for the differential toxicity and smoking habits among -4.26 - the Chinese as described below. It is important to note that the formula includes an increased risk of lung cancer death even after the individual has quit smoking! Once the individual quits smoking the parameter \"y\" does not increase over time. However, it does not decrease, either. After a few years the age factor and the competing causes of death increase in significance so that the latent effect of smoking appears to have attenuated to nearly zero. 44. For transitions from any smoking state to death due to coronary heart disease, the probability of transition is assumed to be twice the probability of transition into the coronary death state if the person did not smoke. In this case, a cessation state is a no smoking state. This relative excess mortality risk is approximately that fot.nd to hold true across large populations in the U.S., and Europe, including Chinese migrant populations. The transition probability into the Cor Pulmonale death state is similarly assumed to be eleven times the transition probability if the person did not smoke. This relative excess mortality risk is the approximate nean risk found to prevail amongst 11 different large studies in several countries. Note that in both of these cases the length of time smoking is not included. Once an individual quits smoking, his risk of transition to either of these death states gradually is reset to that of the nonsmoker risk. This condition is slightly severe in comparison to actual biological return to \"normal\" risk and makes the model results err on the side of conLservative (i.e. low) projections of future death. 45. Transition into the smoking state is calculated from the observed incidence of smokers by age group in the current Chinese population. This requires that the distribution of smokers by duration and age be calculated. This is done as follows. First, the prevalence for all years from 1950 to 1985 is assumed to be proportional to the observed 1985 rate. The proportioiality constant is equal to the ratio of the number of cigarettes consumed per capita in any year since 1950 to that consumed in 1985. The initial lung cancer death rates for people in 1950 are assumed to follow the Peto formula above with each smoker having smoked only 5 years. The number of lung cancer deaths resulting from applying Peto's formula to the number of individuals in each age and smoking duration over .ime is then calculated for all years from 1950 to 1985. The calculated number of deaths in 1985 is then compared with the DSP observed rates. Differences are assumed to be due to the differential toxicity of the Chinese cigarettes and/or the differences in smoking habits of the Chinese from those in Peto's studies. The Peto forn.ula is then adjusted to bring the calculated rates in 1985 more in line with the DSP data. The process is then repeated by starting with the original population in 1950 and moving the \"smoker group\" through time, eliminating individuals who die using the modified Peto formula. This process is repeated as necessary so that the number of deaths due to lung cancer in 1985 agrees with the observed DSP death from lung cancer. In addition, this interactive solution provides estimates of the number of individuals in each duration of smoking group in such a way that the number of individuals smoking agrees with the prevalence data. 46. Transitions from the smoking state to the \"quit-smoking\" states is assumed arbitrarily to be at 1% per year for all age groups. This assumption is also slightly severe in that it is known that most smokers in China quit at -4.27 - ages over 55. The assumption thus also causes the model to project slightly conservative results. HYPERTENSION AND CHOLESTEROL 47. The probabilities for transition into the \"hypertension state\" and the \"hyper-cholesterol\" state are solved simultaneously from equations derived using Bayes theorem. These formulas are based on observed differences in mortality due to cardiovascular and cerebrovascular diseases resulting from hypertension or high cholesterol. The formulas also assume that the probability of transitioning back to the \"well\" state due to drug or diet control is 0.5% for tbe. hypertensives. Probability of transitioning from the \"hyper-cholesterol\" state back to the \"well\" state is zero. The probability of cransitioning iuto the \"hypertensive and hypercholesterol state\" from either the \"hypertensive\" state or tbe \"hypercholesterol\" state is assumed to be twice the probability of transitioning into either the hypertensive state or the cholesterol state from the \"well\" state. While these probabilities are somewhat arbitrary they do not have a significant impact upon the model and they are known to accord roughly with risk factor epidemiological changes which have been observed in large scale studies elsewhere. The prevalence rates used for these formulas came from the MONICA study and the Chinese cholesterol surveys. 48. In order to transition into the state of \"death by hypertensive heart disease\", an individual must be in the one of the \"hypertensive states\". If the observed proportion of hypertensive heart deaths exceeds the number of individuals in all the hypertensive states, then it is assumed that the rate or death from hypertensive heart from the \"well\" state corresponds to that of the hypertensive states, since, apparently some of the hypertensive people are being classified as \"well\". 49. The probability of transitioning into death by stroke from the hypertensive state follows from the conditional probability argument used to get the initial transition rates into the hypertensive states. 50. Transition probabilit, Lnto the coronary heart disease death state from either the hypertensive or the cholesterol risk states are doubled for each risk factor over what they would have been with no risk factor. This means that if an individual smokes, has high cholesterol and is hypertensive, his probability of transitioning into the death by coronary state will be eight times what the transition probability had the individual been in the \"well\" state. This corresponds to known epidemiological risks on the basis of large scale studies in the U.S. and Europe. 51. In the preceding paragraphs we have described a variety of relationships between transition probabilities. With these relations, the mortality rates from the China surveillance data provide the information to estimate the mortality rates for all causes of death conditional on the risk factor states. Naturally some of the transition rates are independent of the risk factor states and consequently are estimated directiy from the DSP data. -4.28 - 52. The population birth rates and initial demographic profile are taken from the Banister report for years up to 2000. The birth rate was assumed to be constant 10.5 per thousand for urban births and 18.97 for rural births for years after 2000. -4.29 - Annex Table 4.3 Page 1 of 3 PROJECTED RISK FACTOR EXPOSURE, DISEASE AND PERIOD SPECIFIC MORTALITY BY CAUSE, 1990 TO 2030 BASE CASE, AGGRESSIVE INTERVENTION CASE AND DIFFERENCE BETWEEN TWO CASES (Risk factor exposure and mortality In thousands of persons, prevalance In percent) Healthy Person with Smokers Smoking Year | Persons HTN CHOLES &CHOLi Total I Male Female revalence BASE CASE, CASE AND AGGRESSIVE INTERVENTION 1990 6,512 (906) 6,435 973 0 0 0 1995 18,142 Table 4.3 Page 2 of 3 PROJECTED RISK FACTOR EXPOSURE, DISEASE AND PERIOD SPECIFIC MORTALITY BY CAUSE, 1990 TO 2030 BASE CASE, AGGRESSIVE INTERVENTION CASE AND DIFFERENCE BETWEEN TWO CASES (Risk factor exposure and mortality In thousands of persons, prevalance In percent) CANCER Year f CervIcal | Lung | Stomach I Liver | Esophagus I All Other MORTALITY(000's) _ BASE CASE, WITH CONTINUATION OF PRESENT AND EXPECTABLE TRENDS 1990 26 139 222 147 l11 235 1995 30 215 229 173 124 281 2000 35 309 232 200 137 332 2005 40 380 233 229 148 387 2010 45 489 233 261 159 444 2015 51 661 235 295 172 503 2020 58 926 237 330 186 568 2025 65 1,303 241 366 201 640 2030 72 1,782 242 398 215 709 |WITH AGGRESSIVE INTERVENTION SCENARIO 1990 26 139 222 147 111 235 1995 30 215 227 169 125 282 2000 35 312 229 201 138 334 2005 35 379 229 232 147 393 2010 35 471 229 267 156 458 2015 18 602 229 306 164 527 2020 18 783 231 347 170 606 2025 39 1,015 233 393 177 697 2030 44 1,277 231 436 182 792 LIVES SAVED -DIFFERENCE BETWEEN CASE AND AGGRESSIVE INTERVENTION 1990 (0) (0) (0) 0 (0) 0 1995 (0) (1) 1 3 (0) (0) 2000 (0) (3) 3 (1) (1) (2) 2005 5 1 4 (3) 1 (6) 2010 11 18 4 (6) 3 (14) 2015 32 59 5 (11) 8 (24) 2020 39 143 6 (18) 15 (38) 2025 26 288 8 (27) 24 (57) 2030 28 505 11 (38) 32 (83) -4.31 - Annex Table 4.3 Page 3 of 3 PROJECTED RISK FACTOR EXPOSURE, DISEASE AND PERIOD SPECIFIC MORTALITY BY CAUSE, 1990 TO 2030 BASE CASE, AGGRESSIVE INTERVENTION CASE AND DIFFERENCE BETWEEN TWO CASES (Risk factor exposure and mortality In thousands of persons, prevalance In percent) Cardiovascular Diseases Cor |Rheumatlc | |Other I HTN |Infectious| All Other |Total FYear Pulmonale I Heart Dis.

China has some of the world's most extensive experience with developing and implementing programs to deal effectively with the communicable and endemic diseases. This section of the report briefly reviews the organiza- tions and main institutions in the health sector and their current programs and policies as they relate to strengths and weaknesses for management of the future illness burden. It then reviews policies for effective management of the chronic diseases. It is in this area where China's experience is limited and where China may be able to quickly take advantage of much of what other countries have learned. A. Oraanization and Functions of the Public Health System 2. The Ministry of Public Health (MOPH)V is responsible for policy direction and implementation, supervision of preventive work, of medical education, of medical service institutions and coordination between the insti- tutions. The structure and responsibilities of the MOPH is mirrored at the Provincial level within a Public Health Bureau; its divisions assume the roles of the MOPH bureaus. Within the last two or three years there has been a gradual devolvement of authority from the MOPH to the Provincial Bureaus, and from them to Prefecture or City Health Bureaus.Y For most practical purposes today the level of the City or Prefecture bears the line responsibility for the financing, provision and regulation of health services. 3. Separate health institutions, sometimes quite sizeable, are under the control of the Railways, major state enterprises and the larger provincial and local industries. The majority of these institutions are now open to the public and contribute to meeting a portion of health care demand in their areas. Fees paid to these institutions, (insurance reimbursements or patient Annex Chart 5.1 shows the organization of the public health care system and the Ministry of Public Health. The structure of China's health care system was examined in the 1984 Bank Country Study, \"China, The Health Sector\" and is discussed here only with reference to important changes and the issues which are discussed in this report. Decentralization of governmental functions has given increased authority to intermediate level administrative units called \"prefectures\" and \"city regions\". Fiscal and budgetary authority resides at this level. The units are approximately equivalent except that prefecture is the title given to predominantly rural groupings of counties; \"city region\" refers to more advanced areas, usually with a medium or small city \"hub\" that is the focus of commerce and industry for the grouping of 10 or so counties surrounding it. -5.2 - payments) are usually set by the local governments at the same level as in the public system, though there are regional variations in fee levels. 4. The State Administration of Traditional Chinese Medicine (TCM) was established in early 1987 as a separate administrative agency reporting directly to the State Council. (Traditional Chinese Medicine had formerly been a separate Bureau within the Ministry of Public Health.) A Vice Minister of the MOPH is the designated director of the Administration. The separate TCM structure is repeated at the Provincial and City levels. The formal TCM structure has as its lowest level a series of TCM hospitals, sometimes quite large institutions. Below these institutions there are many thousands of both formally trained and informally trained traditional practitioners. TCM prac- tices can be found at most western hospitals and in most clinics and health centers. The separate vertical structure is justified by TCM authorities as being needed to protect TCM institutions and personnel from being overwhelmed and absorbed by the larger and financially more powerful western medicine system. Earlier criticisms and reorganizations in Government are cited as evidence of the need for this separate and parallel structure. Unfortunately, the separation of these two approaches to medicine also results in consierable duplication of investment in facilities and equipment. 5. The long run goal for China should continue to be eventual unification of these two approaches to medicine but complexities will necessarily require many years. In the near term reversal of recent policy to establish separate TCM institutions appears to badly be needed. These investment and their attendant stream of recurrent costs are badly misplaced within the list of priorities which China can undertake to meaningfully improve its health care system. Instead, strong signals are urgently needed to speed the process of shared use of hospital facilities, cooperative approaches by TCM and Western medicine, protection of TCM practitioners and departments from the misplaced zeal of western trained physicians as has happened in the past and, most importantly, mobilization and training of TCM practitioners as part of primary prevention strategy against chronic disease. 6. The Peonle's Liberation Army (PIA) manages a large network of medical facilities, including four major medical universities and a number of both large and intermediate hospitals, all under the General Logistics Department of the PLA. With demobilization of a part of the PIA over the last five years, the PIA hospital system has developed substantial excess capacity and its managers have increased their focus on services provided to the civilian population. PIA hospitals admitted about 1 million civilian in-patients in 1987 and treated about 20 million civilian out-patients. This hospital capacity represents a substantial resource for China to mobilize in its approach to health care. Students at the PIA medical universities often enter practice in the civilian sectors after graduation. The Academy of Military Medical Sciences in Beijing undertakes a wide range of basic and applied -5.3 - research, much of it with relevance to civil public health and chronic disease issues.- 7. Historically the PIA health services have played an important role in China's \"prevention first\" strategy which accounted for much of the early success against the communicable and endemic diseases. This civil \"disease prevention\" role of the PIA is continued today but in reduced form. For some of the chronic diseases, and for some of the risk factors, such as smoking, China may again want to involve PLA personnel in the fight against disease. At minimum, Chlna may wish to consider the present and future costs and health problems of smoking amongst its military personnel -in most countries this constitutes one of the highest tobacco risk groups. On the positive side China may wish to mobilize the considerable management and organization skills residing in the PIA health system. Almost without exception, PLA hospitals tend to be better managed and maintained than their civilian counterparts. As described in other parts of this report improved management and maintenance of hospital facilities is one of the most important considerations in controlling costs while making better use of existing health infrastructure. The Role of Departments within the MOPH 8. Most preventive medicine has been a public health responsibility and, until recently, has been vertically organized with the mandate for con- trolling specific communicable disease centrally vested in the MOPH through its Bureau of Epidemic Prevention and Hygiene or the Bureau of Endemic Disease Control. The Anti-Epidemic and Hygiene Stations (AES) at Provincial, City and county-level are under the vertical technical control of the MOPH AES Bureau and are responsible for controlling communicable diseases, monitoring environmental health and food hygiene, assisting in implementation of patriotic health campaigns and health education. There are separate Endemic Disease Institutions in areas with high prevalence rates for key endemic diseases. Their preventive activities include: the notifiable disease monitoring and reporting system, the immunization program and its implementation, health education programs, mobilization and organization of programs for endemic disease control, and administration of patients within the community who have communicable diseases which do not necessarily require continued hospitalization (TB, leprosy, etc). The AES is also responsible for formulating and monitoring environmental sanitation standards, water and air pollution and health status related thereto. Sanitation and hygiene, including industrial hygiene has recently been made the responsibility of a new bureau, created from within the previous AES structure. With the exception of a few experimental sites, the AES has no existing responsibilties Y This includes E. Coli and cholera vaccine research, Hepatitis B epidemiology research, vector ecology and control, leukemia research (development of mono-clonal antibodies to classify leukemia antigens), Veterinary Dysentery Vaccine Research (for dysentery in pigs, a major cause of pig mortality and weight loss), Dengue viruses research, simple technology alternatives for goiter prevention and genetically engineered Hepatitis A and B vaccines. -5.4 - AV= Chart 5.1 Organization Plan of the Ministry of Public Health Mlklly of PWtHMtoI*1 I Riste Pr,y Health Cae iionrn S nisatIon a Inspecton OcO HyWene Dision France D n an- S i mool end Foo gene Dion s P n tHealt Eduction Divsion Eriwtt Hygiene responsXiy. -5.5 - for monitoring of cause and incidence of trauma, for prevention ot injuries, or for coordinating with other public and safety authorities to reduce the incidence of trauma or foster injury prevention, at home, in public or in work-places. 9. The formal AES system stops at the county level and both communicable disease and hygiene functions remain integrated within a single institution at that level. Preventive work below county level is usually the responsibility of a unit within the township health center, together with the rural doctors of the village health stations. These units and their personnel are under the technical guidance and supervision of the county, mainly the AES but are administratively part of and are fui'ded by the township government. A new regulation governing the roles and responsibilities of the AES is under preparation. It is broad and comprehensive in approach and provides some regulatory and enforcement authority to the AES. It remains uncertain whether the AES role will be defined in such a way that its staff can reorient their activities to effectively deal with the lingering problems of communicable and endemic diseases and at the same time play a major role in a new strategy to reduce and postpone the onset of the chronic diseases. 10. The Medical Administration Bureau of the MOPH has nominal respon- sibility for policies and standards governing the establishment and operation of hospitals and other health care facilities. The State Administration for TCM has a similar Bureau for TCM hospitals. Hospitals and their strengths and weaknesses are discussed in detail in Annex Chapter 6. Both Western and TCM Hospitals play a currently limited but important role in prevention. This includes identification and reporting of cases of communicable disease, treatment and follow-up of patients, and carrying out parts of preventive programs organized by the AES, especially aspe^ts of prevention which require hospital skills, such as pregnancy and post-natal follow-up, and screening for chronic diseases. Considerable scope exists for hospitals to play a more effective role in prevention particularly for the chronic diseases. This would include primary prevention activities (including health education) for inpatients or outpatients, and an active community out-reach program for technical assistance to lower levels and for well-selected screening programs. These roles are now not often performed because of bureaucratic perceptions and, more importantly, lack of funding. 11. Maternal and Child Health. A separate Bureau within the MOPH is responsible for policies and directions in MCH care. A vertical system of MCH organization exists down to the county level (and in some cases the township level). Separate MCH hospitals have been built in many areas and at the lowest level separate MCH centers and clinics perform a variety of preventive, care and family planning services. The vertical organization gave China considerable strength in the past to ensure attention to important MCH problems. It also resulted in considerabi. duplication and demand for similar facilities, equipment and skills at a number of levels. Strong bureaucratic tendencies combined with financial incentives now appear to threaten effective MCH care and strategy unless further reforms are mandated (Section C. below discusses these issues further). -5.6 - Special Functions within the Health System 12. The Chinese Academy of Preventive Medicine (CAPM). The CAPM was established as part of the MOPH in the early part of this decade with ambitious objectives which are intimately linked to the inevitable health agenda of the future: a) to undertake fundamental and applied research on preventive medicine and coordinate preventive medicine research programs throughout.the country; b) to provide technical assistance to lower level institutions and train public health professionals throughout the country; c) to surveil, monitor and supervise health, epidemic prevention and quarantine programs; d) to develop a scientific basis for establishing regulations and standards for public health priorities and policies; and e) to collect, analyze and study and exchange information on preventive medicine. 13. This ambitious set of objectives combines some of the attributes and roles of the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and of the U.S. National Institutes of Health. China clearly needs such an institution -indeed a CAPH that can meet these objectives may be an absolutely essential condition to effectively dealing with the challenges of the health transition. In some respects CAPM is doing very well in taking up the task set for it. In discussion of the issues raised in this report it is hoped that CAPMs role will be further examined and an operational consensus thereon can be reached to give CAPM the authority and mandate to pursue the major challenges which lie ahead. 14. Disease Surveillance Functions. There are currently two disease surveillance systems, one for communicable disease and one for chronic disease. The communicable disease reporting system is based in the AES and was established soon after Liberation due to high prevalence of communicable disease. Most communicable diseases are required to be reported monthly, quarterly and annually through this system. There are 25 officially notifiable diseases, some requiring immediate report by phone. All health care personnel have the responsibility to report these diseases to the AES by the use of standardized reporting forms. For this purpose the AES at each level has a special Epidemic Prevention and Vaccination Unit. Below the county level there is a similar unit in townshiV health centers. These units are mainly responsible for collecting, sorting data, and monitoring the prevalence of disease. Disease surveillance data is progressively centralized from lowter to higher levels. The data collected nationwide is consolidated and analyzed by CAPM and the MOPH and reports are issued on a monthly, quarterly and annual basis. 15. Because the chronic diseases have emerged as an important problem in recent years, a reporting system has also been established for them. It is not yet as comprehensive or systematic as the system for communicable diseases. Routine surveillance data is based on a variety of information about hospital activities and diseases of inpatients and outpatients. All hospitals and health care institutions are required to provide such data to the statistics division of the Health Bureau at each level. These are aggregated and simple tabulations are analyzed at the health bureau at each -5.7 - level. Data flows, consistency of reporting and processing of information does not yet work well. 16. The absence of a national, systematic surveillance system has been a problem for the MOPH. Since 1982 a network of disease surveillance points (DSP. now numbering 100) has progressively been estaLlished by the MOPH (the AES Buteau and the Chinese Academy of Preventive Medicine (CAPM)) to monitor both the chronic and communicable diseases. Over ten million people are now routinely covered by this surveillance network which provides a valuable source of epidemiological information (Annex Box 1.2 in main report). Ability to analyze and use the data generated is of high priority because it is through timely use of such epidemiological data that short term disease intervention actions and longer term prevention programs can be properly designed by the Ministry and by Provincial and City Bureaus of Health. Institutions and personnel who are capable of utilizing DSP data are far too few in number. The lack of clearly assigned roles and responsibilities for chronic disease epidemiology and analysis is a second problem requiring attention. The need for continued high level support and guidance to the provinces and lower-level regions by CAPM and the MOPH will be a precondition to eventual successful development of a good system of health statistics and ability of administrators to use them for planning and management. This support will have to take several forms -curricula reform in the medical colleges, national conferences, development of professional journals and publicizing of model projects which effectively use such data and approaches for design of effective health programs, as well as considerable practical staff training in applied epidemiology and its use in planning. 17. Health Education Functions. Patriotic health campaigns by the Central and local Tatriotic Health Campaign Committees (PHCCs) in the 50s and 60s targeted vector control and improvement of environmental sanitation to considerably reduce prevalence of many parasitic and communicable diseases. Some of these campaigns, even though not by prior planning or design, were models of sound health education. The ;dCC provided inter-sectoral coordination of relevant agencies and programs with a high degree of politically directed management and leadership. This high level direction and control provided much of the foundation for success of these programs. It also carried with it the risks of excess, misdirection of effort and the consequent diminished credibility which has effected PHCC efforts in the last decade. 18. Today health education is one of several responsibilities of the PHCC in cooperation with the Ministry of Public Health. The Minister is a Vice Chairman of the PHCC. In general, throughout the last decade, health education has been a badly neglected, underfinanced and fragmented activity. To strengthen it, a National Health Education Institute was founded in early 1986. There is also a Health Education Institute or Station in each province, and in many cities and counties. These units are responsible for guidance to lower levels and for publication or distribution of materials and conduct of programs. The unit of health education in the AES acts as a supplement to the health education network, but in some areas, if there is no separate health education station, this section of the AES will act in carrying out -5.8 - activities. Health education media in China today include publications (newspapers, magazines, posters, audio-visual materials (films and broad- casts), billboards in public areas, and school health education. 19. An effective, powerful and well-financed health education infrastruc- ture will be an essential element in any reasonable approach to reduction in exposure to risk factors for China's population. This will be especially true for efforts aimed at smoking cessation. 'ie PHCC today has a small unit dealing with tobacco control issues. It is under-staffed, under-funded and unlikely to be effective in either leading or supporting meaningful efforts at tobacco control unless the political level leadership of the PHCC, and the Ministry of Public Health, are able to quantify, analyze and reach a consensus on the extent and nature of the tobacco threat. This report is intended in part to provide information which may aid the MOPH and PHCC in that process. The amounts of money, the special interests groups involved, the complexity of the issues and the importance to the future social and economic costs of tobacco usage in China are of fundamental importance and deserve careful consideration by the highest levels of China's leadership. B. A Framework for Chronic Disease Management. 20. The Planning Process. Planning is critical to developing a chronic disease prevention and control program. Many usable planning systems follow a problem-oriented approach. With any system, care must be taken in defining the problem, setting goals and objectives, designing the program, and evaluating results. This becomes an iterative process with evaluation leading to refined definition of the problems, objectives, methods and evaluation. The field of chronic disease is so complex that a clear statement of the problem is especially important. The purpose and goal of any control effort must be clearly understood because many groups and individuals must direct their efforts to a common end. The development of strategic plans for chronic disease control and for each target is a basic step in this process. 21. The disease problem, condition, or risk factor to be targeted should be selected on the basis of the burden of illness that can be reduced. This burden is arrived at in general by considering the magnitude of the problem in terms of morbidity, mortality, and cost; the preventability of the problem in terms of scientific state of the art; and the potential efficacy of the program. Measurable objectives should be established which form the basis for program activities and evaluation. From these objectives flow the actions needed to reach the objectives. In each of the disease specific sections below analysis and suggestions specific to China's health care system and epidemiology are made for consideration in development of strategy. 22. Programs to control chronic diseases can be viewed in several ways: by the type of prevention (primary, secondary or tertiary), by the groups targeted, or by the natural history of the disease. A program eventually involves some combination of these approaches. 23. Level of Prevention. The concepts of primary and secondary prevention end tertiary care (treatment and cure) for chronic disease are complex. This -5.9 - arises because many conditions are also risk factors for other disease outcomes. 24. Since most chronic diseases do not have a simple etiology, primary prevention is aimed at elimination of as many potential risk factors as possible. The advantage of addressing major risk factors is that they affect many, even most, of the population and have an impact on many diseases. Y Interventions targeted toward primary risk factors are broad-based -An include, for example, use of the public media, reimbursement policies for health care, school health education, economic incentives and regulations for industry and public safety. Chinese medical equipment and pharmaceutical manufacturers and the state agencies that are responsible for them need to become full partners in China's second health care revolution. They need to improve the quality and reliability of their products and cooperate actively with health authorities to develop products responsive to China's epidemiology and income. There is thus ample scope and the need for central and local authorities other than those in the formal health sector to concern themselves with primary prevention. Other state agencies especially financial authorities need to deal wisely with vested interests such as the tobacco and food processing industries to uphold cow-.on good over short term financial gain. National goals in this regard should be established. 25. Secondary prevention is the prevention of an adverse outcome among persons with a pre-established condition (e.g. treatment of hypertension to prevent stroke or heart attack). Secondary prevention techniques are closely associated with particular chronic diseases and risk factors since the knowledge base for specific diseases and their treatment is substantial. Secondary prevention is thus mainly the responsibility of the health system, its professional personnel and of those who are afflicted with the disease. For most major chronic diseases, specific management techniques can have a major impact on avoiding, minimizing, or delaying complications. Interventions should be based on identification of the population at risk, treatment, and follow-up. Education of both the patient, and the content of education and training programs for health professionals, play a prominent role in the effectiveness of secondary prevention. Most of China's medical education system is still geared to the health problems of the past and the western medical model; reform and reorientation of its focus will poses a major stumbling block for whatever strategy of chronic disease control China eventually develops. There will be a great need for effective in-service training programs to help reorient and strengthen the ability of China's existing health personnel to better deal with the prevention of chronic diseases. 26. Secondary prevention concepts can also address quality of and access to care, as research has shown that these can have a substantial impact on the course of the chronic diseases. Both health and non-health authorities at Non-biological and non-environmental aspects of life can also be considered as risk factors -for example, access to care and quality of care and quality of technology. -5.10 - local and national levels may wish to question whether the traditional approach to acquisition and expansion of capital assets (buildings and equipment) in pursuit of the medical model may pose a stumbling block for a strategy for prevention. Decentralization of financial responsibilities has accelerated the pace of urban investment in health, which is not bad in itself but its pattern may be inappropriate; this aspect of decentralization has also worsened existing urban:rural imbalances in health investment and may leave those rural populations at greater risk. Perhaps the most important systemic aspect which impedes access to secondary prevention and medical care for most Chinese has been the collapse of the rural insurance system. While the old system had many flaws and problems it did help to permit widespread access. It will take many years for China's social welfare systems to be soundly and economically developed. Central and provincial authorities must insure that secondary prevention programs are adequately funded. Health authorities must conduct these programs efficiently and economically as these can involve substantial waste if improperly managed. Later chapters of this report consider growth and trends in health expenditures and implications of the growing burden of chronic illness in more detail. 27. Effective management of tertiary prevention (treatment and cure) holds particular promise and risk for China. Already there is a considerable backlog of congenital and rheumatic heart disease morbidity and disability which can be treated with major gains to both the quality and quantity of life for many Chinese. There are many secondary prevention techniques for the chronic diseases, including ph3sical therapy and high-quality medical services, which enhance the quality of life and are suitable for application at the tertiary level. Eventual application of public health principals to organ procurement and transplantation will offer alleviation from suffering and provide cure for many by the end of this century. However, tertiary care has proven.a very difficult area of management in the developed countries and some segments of the medical profession in China, with its existing large stock of high level hospitals, of highly trained and sophisticated doctors, will no doubt make a strong claim for large expenditure of resources on technology and facilities. Some of these claims will push on the margins between tertiary preventior. and questionable prolongation of life of dubious quality. There are few professional, official, or public channels in China today which offer opportunity for discussion and guidance in this subject. 28. Target Groups. Since any group of individuals may share a set of known risks, preventive measures can be targeted to that group. This principle guides many educational and health care programs. A classic example is infant health. Primary prevention focuses on intrauterine development and early childhood. Providing adequate nutrition, reducing toxic exposures such as alcohol and smoking during gestation, and altering risk factors for genetic disorders are components of primary prevention. Immunization, adequate nutrition, early detection, and treatment and school health education can be viewed as part of a package of preventive measures for children. The needs of adolescents and adults, though different, can be defined, and preventive interventions can be directed toward them. Defining other populations with known risks, such as minority groups or women of childbearing age, can establish them as the focus for preventive efforts. The many needs of these -5.11 - groups may be addressed more efficiently on a collective basis rather than on a disease-by-disease or risk condition-by-condition basis. This approach underlies much of China's success in primary health care and in the health status gains achieved thus far. In addition to targeting to groups above, risks from malaria and schistosomiasis could be targeted by geographic region. A contact, or network approach can also be taken -e.g. those at risk from tuberculosis and their contacts can be tracked. While the principles of targeting hold, the chronic diseases pose a somewhat different challenge in defin'ng target groups. 29. The natural history of each chronic disease can be divided into three periods -susceptibility, asymptomatic period, clinical illness -followed by recovery or death. Potential for intervention exists at each phase. During the period of susceptibility, individuals may reduce their risk -generally by primary prevention techniques and this is now the phase most neglected but with the greatest potential for gains to be made by increased attention. During the asymptomatic period, detect5on and early treatment become the major focus but there is limited scope for this for many chronic diseases. Finally, tertiary prevention (treatment) is the major modality during the period of clinical illness. In each period however the focus for prevention is on the individual at risk; it often requires his own active and continual involvement and it is often labor intensive and recurrent cost intensive for professional health personnel whose specialized knowledge is required during the asymptomatic and clinical illness periods. This is quite different from the challenges of the past. It also implies the need for a considerable change of approach from today's practices in China and the policies being followed by financial and planning authorities. Rather than providing budgets for construction and equipment of care institutions, they many need to provide budgetary funding for health service delivery. Rather than stressing capital accumulation, revenue earning and decentralization in the health sector they may need to stress public funding of recurrent programs costs, financial charges mainly to influence utilization and greater central government influence, funding and control over health activities. 30. Intervention Strategies. Several basic strategies warrant discussion: educational, health care service delivery, and social and environmental. 31. Educational. Basic information is often essential to influencing behavior. At a minimum, knowledge reinforces healthy behavior, though, in some cases, a person may change attitudes without understanding why such changes are important. Educational programs can increase knowledge but influencing attitudes is more difficult and this must be done before behavior can be expected to change. Systems for education of the public, patients and health care providers must be established for this purpose. Patients receive information from patient education programs and from health workers and physicians, from the media, and friends and relatives. Patient education in informal classes in an outpatient setting can reduce cost. Most personal interventions are labor intensive. They can only reach people who attend programs. -5.12 - 32. Media campaigns play a key role in increasing awareness about problems and the availability of solutions. Marketing is most effective when the target group can efficiently be reached through existing credible sources. Although the efficacy of these approaches is not clearly established, major national media may be useful in reducing most common conditions, including most major risk factors. Regulations can also reduce exposure to many high- risk behaviors -use of tobacco for example. Media campaign also help to create a climate in which potential solutions to health problems become more acceptable. Publicity about the hazards of smoking for instance, makes it easier to establish smokeless worksites, no-smoking sections for public transport, and to take other voluntary and legal steps that reduce health risk. The media also creates role models who can be used to influence behavior. 33. All parts of the educational, medical, and media systems need to transmit consistent health messages. A consensus should be based on the best available information and should be transmitted to practitioners by integrating it into their basic and postgraduate education. Health professionals can be reached through continuing education programs, their colleagues, economic incentives and marketing by Industry. 34. Health Care Service Delivery. The delivery of quality care is critical in preventing most chronic diseases. All patients must have access to care. The increasingly pluralistic nature of China's economic system and ongoing decentralization require that many approaches be used to facilitate availability of care at a variety of levels. Most Chinese will be mainly served by primary care facilities until well into the next century. It is important that state-of-the-art preventive care and thinking be established in these primary care settings. Formalization and propagation of recommendations for prevention and treatment of the major chronic diseases will facilitate the attention to and use of currently accepted practices. This should extend to assuring the quality of all services provided, including examinations, screening, laboratory testing, medical procedures and follow-up. 35. Social and Environmental. Many of the major risk factors are directly associated with cultural habits and mores. Changes can be slowly brought about by using social institutions such as the media, the legal system, schools and neighborhood and professional associations. Economic incentives for healthy behaviors could include reduction of insurance premiums (such as for normal body weight, non-smoking), job requirements (to avoid injury), and taxes (such as those on tobacco). Certain health care provisions do nothing to encourage healthy behavior, e.g. the present full coverage (no deductible) for labor and government employee insurance. 36. Regulatory approaches have a mixed history of success in most countries but can also be important. Regulation of the food and drug industry for quality has an undoubted beneficial effect. Industry's responsiveness to changes in habits and to governmental initiatives can also make a marked difference on health. For example industry can gradually reduce salt levels in prepared foods and breads, uie only unsaturated oils in processing foods, and moderate the use of nitrates and nitrites for preservation. It can also set up preventive health care programs, contests and incentives for its -5.13 - workers and their dependents as well as the surrounding community. Sponsorship of health information programs regarding major health risks such as tobacco, can also be effective when undertaken by industry. Industrial sponsorship of and financial contributions to major public media messages and of national and local voluntary associations (e.g. heart, lung, or diabetes associations) is an area which may hold much promise for mobilizing additional support for prevention programs in China. 37. Other examples of the multi-sectoral and multi-factorial elements of potential intervention programs can easily be listed for Chinese leaders to consider in development of preventive strategies. Agricultural policies influence diets; employment policies affect behavior; disability can be reduced by eliminating barriers to productivity and mobility. The structure of the health care system itself can affect utilization, access and cost; the attitudes of health workers can be a barrier to access and can undercut even the best designed prevention program. 38. Each of the possible intervention items discussed above needs to be the subject of ongoing discussion, prioritizing, implementation and evaluation in a preventive health care strategy. Those persons and government agencies involved in the process should not believe that it is their task to seek an optimal, fixed and stable solution to the problem of defining a preventive strategy. Instead the goal should be a dynamic, and constantly renewing approach to prevention so that changes in disease patterns, in technology of prevention and medical intervention and in risks can be accommodated in China's health delivery service. C. Reduction of Exposure to Risk. 39. In its approach to prevention of the chronic diseases, China needs to consider whether it must go through the same lengthy period, undertake similar detailed studies, spend time and money experimenting with approaches and technology which have been tried elsewhere and found eventually not to be relevant or efficacious. Alternatively, China may have the opportunity to repeat only selected aspects of western studies of chronic disease, to refine its own approach more quickly, to take advantage of the wealth of learning materials and techniques developed elsewhere, and to quickly move far ahead in its effort to control chronic disease. Much of the eventual decision on this point will depend on the support of the medical profession and the public health authorities in China. If they choose to do so these groups can, in a relatively short period, assemble incontrovertible evidence of the need to adopt a preventive strategy. Similarly, political and financial authorities could act in parallel to provide the mandate and funding to carry it out. 40. Without a concerted effort by the medical authorities to inform political and financial leaders of the of the needs and benefits of China adopting a preventive approach, it is doubtful that adequate resources will be provided for prevention programs. The reasons are two-fold. a. Risk factors for the chronic diseases are often multifactorial and in some cases synergistic. They are also socially complex. Many -5.14 - programs for chronic disease control must be based on the alteration of individual behavior. The success of such programs is the sum total of millions of individual acts of choice. Given individual variation and unavoidable social differences, a positive result of such programs depends on these programs being able to bring about the desired choice in large numbers of people, at least over some period of time, and being able to sustain these changes for decades. b. Second, the chronic diseases move in slow motion. The pathologic processes take years to develop and become manifest. The constellation of risks which produce the pathology are imbedded in community understandings and habits which change slowly. The sequence of maneuvers in a preventive program is difficult to discern and the effect on outcome even more so. 41. It is therefore usually very difficult to gain the needed long term attention from planning and financial authorities, and from the community at large, that such programs must be sustained in any strategic approach to the health problems of an aging society. 42. Actions to reduce some of the risk factors will affect strongly vested and powerful interests (notably tobacco), others will involve the slow change of long established tastes and habits. Prospects of making any real progress against most of the risk factors will necessitate a cooperative and integrated approach of a number of sectors and this may be difficult to attain without strong political support at the highest levels. It will almost certainly be necessary to make the best use of both western and traditional Chinese medicine in a cooperative and supportive approach to encourage community behavioral change. It will also be necessary to expand and integrate the health promotion and propaganda efforts of the Patriotic Health Campaign Committee (PHCC) with national and local health programs to undertake a multifactorial, multi-sectoral and very long term program of community health promotion. By their very nature, programs for the prevention of chronic disease must be more sophisticated, longer lasting, and less vertical-command oriented than the rodent and vector control activities which the PHCC has been accustomed to conducting. The degree of political support, the barriers, and the changes of approach will require much further discussion within China. .Tobacco Risks -the Future. 43. The projection model discussed in Annex Chapter 4 also estimates future age-specific smoking prevalence (Annex Table 4.5 section 20) \"with\" and \"without\" a preventive approach. Data from Annex Chapter 3 provide a relatively good understanding of smoking prevalence today by age group, and patterns of smoking initiation in other countries provide a good indication of the directions and pace at which cigarette smoking in China will increase if policies are not put firmly in place to constrain it. Cigarette smoking is the main cause for many of the chronic diseases which will account for most future mortality and morbidity. Annex Chapter 4 of the main report contains detailed estimates of the share of deaths which may be avoided by early initiation of smoking control. While China may be able to do even better than -5.15 - estimated by the model, much future death is unavoidable because of current levels and duration of smoking exposure. There is no doubt that many in the agricultural and industrial sectors in China and elsewhere will disagree with some of the conclusions reached in this report and will argue for a more relaxed approach to smoking control to protect the domestic tobacco industry. A slightly different perspective on smoking may help China's leaders to view these arguments in context however and will assist future strategy development. 44. Smoking prevalence and consumption per smoker data allow us also to use the projection model to estimate future possible cigarette consumption. There appears to be a serious problem emerging after the year 2000 with an inability to meet possible future cigarette demand. This implies that price increases will be necessary to achieve equilibrium and recognition of this early by government allows it the opportunity to \"capture the economic rents\" from emerging shortages to the benefit of both public finance and national health status. 45. Rough estimates of the future consumption of cigarettes show that even with optimistic assumptions about the effectiveness of smoking cessation policies which Government may implement, total cigarette consumption will continue to grow for decades before declining slightly to a level well-above even today's total consumption (Annex Chart 5.2). This indicates that arguments by domestic or foreign tobacco interests against smoking control efforts should be viewed skeptically. Without such efforts, inevitable demographic developments and smoking experience elsewhere shows that by about 2020 cigarette consumption in China alone could exceed today's world cigarette consumption of 5 trillion cigarettes. Demand could only be satisfied by a combination of greatly expanded imports, much greater acreage devoted to domestic production and price increases to constrain consumption. Avoidance of undue growth of imports, protection of domestic industry, safeguarding of agricultural lands for food production (and of forestry resources otherwise required for tobacco curing) all mediate in favor of strong smoking cessation policies, including higher cigarette taxes to increase Government revenues. 46. Alternative 1 in the above chart shows cigarette consumption trends on the assumption that age-specific smoking prevalence will increase over 1985 levels only very moderately among men and women, and that cigarette consumption per smoker will only very slowly increase over the next 40 years to approximately 75% of the levels in the U.S. in 1985. Alternative 2 shows consumption effects under the same prevalence assumption but with cigarettes per smoker staying fixed at today's level. Alternative 3 shows consumption if China can succeed in controlling smoking as projected by the model (roughly equal to the smoking control performance achieved in the U.S. over the last 25 years) but with cigarettes per smoker rising slowly as in alternative 1. Alternative 4 shows the effects a good smoking control efforts with average per capita consumption also remaining at only today's level. The most important factor in the large growth in consumption under any of these projections is the huge number of young people, today under age 15, many of whom are almost certain to initiate smoking unless sharply different policies _ 5.16 - Annex Chart 5.2 China: Alternative Cigarette Consumption Estimates (Cigarettes in Billions) 6,000 5,000 4,000 3,000 2,000 1,000 0 1990 1995 2000 2005 2010 2015 2020 2025 2030 -- Alternative 1 -Alternative 2 --- Alternative 3 -Alternative 4 are put into effect. The Chinese tobacco industry has little to worry about even with excellent performance on smoking control. Import and agricultural policy may be confronted with a very difficult problem if demand is allowed to grow without severe restraint as the children now under age 15 begin to take up smoking. Early action by Government to increase cigarette taxes could ensure capture for public benefit of the price increases needed to constrain demand rather than allowing industry only to reap the profits of higher prices. 47. There are a wide range of practical actions for China to consider for its people in order to reduce the prevalence of smoking, to protect those who have not yet begun smoking and to help those who would substantially benefit from quitting smoking (see Annex Box 5.1 on regulatory approaches and Annex Box 5.2 on the U.S. effort). Other policy actions can be directed toward industry to restrain it from using techniques and tactics which have proven seductive and effective in other countries, including much of Asia (see Annex Box 5.3 on smoking cessation efforts in Hong Kong). -5.17 - Annex Box 5.1 Smoking Control -A Regulatory Approach In addition to the relative easy and I.

Elements of a National Tobacco Control Program. 48. International experience for tobacco control shows the necessity for a comprehensive approach of epidemiologic surveillance and analysis, legislation and regulation, education and publicity, tax increases and provision of help with quitting smoking. Each of these activities would be important for China as part of a tobacco control program. 49. Surveillance and good epidemiological analysis is the foundation of quality public health programs worldwide. China's disease surveillance points (DSPs), provincial and county data systems, surveys and studies can equip government authorities with some of the information they need to make informed decisions to protect health, to assist those most in need, and to quantify the adverse social and econcmic costs of smoking. 50. Legislation and Regulations. More than 70 nations have enacted legislation to control smoking. Many countries, having first adopted moderate controls, and have subsequently put more restrictive legislation in place. Approaches include: Health Warnings - Smoking kills Smoking is addictive Smoking causes lung cancer Smoking causes heart disease Smoking in pregnancy harms your baby Quit smoking and feel healthier China does not yet require health warnings though some more expensive brands of domestic cigarettes voluntarily include a warning. Imported cigarettes frequently -5.18 - contain no warning, though the manufacturers would be required to include a warning if they sold the same package in their home countries. 51. Limits on Harmful Substances. Lowering tar in cigarettes can prevent about one third of the cases of lung cancer which would otherwise occur. A ceiling of about 12 -15 mgs of tar per cigarette may have this effect. Compulsory testing is carried out by governments in many countries and China may wish to consider this. Domestically made cigarettes in China mainly have very high levels of tar (30-35 mgs). Imported cigarettes are often high tar and nicotine variants which the manufacturers would no longer market in their own countries. Foreign manufacturers have appeared to be withholding introduction of better quality filtered cigarettes and low tar variants until they are forced to do so. This same strategy has been used in Latin America and other parts of Asia to then gain a greater foothold in those market by alleging in a health conscious environment that the foreign product is safer (and superior) to domestic products. Lower tar cigarettes are not \"safe\" cigarette,s. 52. Smoke-Free Areas. Smoking is not only unpleasant but also dangerous to non-smokers. China's efforts to ban smoking in public transport, waiting rooms, hospitals, schools and many public buildings is already well advanced, though enforcement efforts may need strengthening. In its total ban on smoking on most domestic airline flights, China has joined Norway, Sweden, Israel, the Soviet Union, Australia and the United States. 53. Advertising and Promotion. Advertising recruits the young to smoking with powerful, attractive, sporty, healthy outdoor images. An enormous amount of money is spent by the tobacco industry on advertising, for example Rmb. 115 million equivalent in Hong Kong alone for a population of 5 million. In the United States the tobacco industry, even with many forms of advertising bans, spends over US$2,000 million annually. Public health authority budgets to combat this deluge of smoking propaganda are very small by comparison. The U.S. Office of Smoking and Health has a total budget of less than US$3 million. Both on national and local levels China may wish to consider budgets available for health promotion and education, especially for tobacco control. A complete ban on all tobacco promotion may be necessary. In Norway such a ban is in effect for television, the print media, cinema, billboards, buses and trains. Partial bans do not appear to work. 54. Health Education, Public health education on the dangers of smoking is vital, especially for young people. Programs usually have four objectives: to make the community aware of the dangers; to encourage smokers to stop; to discourage non-smokers from starting; and to promote the rights of non- smokers to a smoke-free environment. Doctors are very effective in giving background information to the public, in counseling individual patients and in advising government at various levels on anti-smokirg action. Support of medical organizations is also important. Education, training and utilization of health personnel is thus an important element of health education in regard to smoking cessation. -5.19 - Annex Jox5 National Funding of Smoking Cessation Efforts - the U.S. Case certainly of strategic relevance to China, not only losses att ribut kbls to hokeng ar consid serious in its specific findings but in its design and ap- lnough in tht United Stotks to bo the subject of pros h which could be wd in China to provide concrete nation tl Ucv nim t prograts to de ta s ethc most o Jvidnce of the methods end approaches to smoking nffatio walsoeoentprgams to determin th st cessation which work best in China.

Most smokers give cost and health as the two reasons for quitting. Some countries have measured the effect of taxation on cigarette consumption. For example, in England, for every 1% rise in price there is a 0.5% decrease in smoking. The World Health Organization concluded in 1984 that \"Millions of lives could be saved if steep taxes were imposed on tobacco.\" Total cigarette sales are continuing to rise very rapidly in China despite present levels of taxation. This is a clear indication tilat government could further raise taxes, thus both improving its revenues and benefitting the lives of people who otherwise would smoke. -5.20 - Annex Box 5.3 Reductions in the Number of Smokers -The Case of Hong Kong Hong Kong has 5.5 million resLdents, 981 Chin- Cordinatl lbdy stablisd.

A number of simultaneous steps could be taken: a. removal of cigarettes from the basket of goods included in the consumer price index. (It is the only toxic, addictive product now included); -5.21 - b. elimination of the special category of imported cigarettes intended to be sold at a lesser price through state stores and hotels. (This will be strongly resisted by foreign companies as it is a primary marketing and advertising channel for them); c. imposition of a health warning label stamp fee on all domestically produced cigarettes. This will provide modest consumer health education but more importantly would discourage further growth in consumption while raising substantial additional revenues for the state. If the proceeds of this stamp fee accrue only to the center government it will help to hold constant the marginal incentives of the producing provinces. Regardless of the portion of the fee which accrues to the center a small portion, say 10%, of the stamp fee should be earmarked for the health education and disease prevention budgets of the MOPH and the Patriotic Health Campaign Committee; d. imposition of a health warning label stamR fee on all imported cigarettes; e. authorization to customs and public security and health bureau officials to seize and destroy all cigarettes found for sale without the appropriate health warning label stamp. 57. These changes would increase revenues to the state, provide the basis for a permanently financed health education and disease prevention budget, permit the basis for easy identification and seizure of illegal cigarettes and on which taxes have not been paid -both imported and domestically produced (tlhis would also help to protect the China National Tobacco Corporation from small enterprise production which is now escaping taxation), and it would provide immediate and lasting health and financial benefits to those who stop smoking and to the young and to women who are discouraged from initiating smoking. 58. National Coordinating Body/ Council on Tobacco or Health. The WHO has recommended that all member states set up a national council on tobacco or health to prepare, coordinate, supervise and undertake measures against the harmful effects of tobacco. In February 1990 China formally established the National Association on Smoking and Health with broad, inter-ministerial cooperation and support. Eventual effective development of this organization may succeed in implementing some of the recommendations of this report. Diet: Fat Consumption Risks. 59. Several points important for future health strategy and chronic disease prevention seem clear. Rates of cancers believed to be linked to fat consumption are still very low in China. General obesity in the population from excessive caloric and fat consumption is also low but growing in urban areas. Continuation of the trend would present an additional major risk factor for diabetes. China does not yet have a serious problem with high cholesterol being a widespread additional risk factor for cardiovascular disease. It should try to avoid such a problem developing. This will require -5.22 - modification of some accepted thinking about the desirable diet for the future. Agricultural policies to achieve a diet which continues to be high in fiber and carbohydrates and low in animal fat may be difficult for some agencies in government to accept as such a diet does not accord with established thinking about what should be a desirable diet. Further research should be undertaken to identify the groups which may now or in the near future be at increased risk of elevated cholesterol. This research should not neglect children and the longer term impact of the generally richer diet which they may be receiving as a consequence of economic improvement. For those risk groups which are identified, health education programs should be initiated to assist public awareness and capacity to make appropriate diet shifts. Considerable professional education efforts directed at physicians and nurses are likely to be even more important aspects of health education if a good level of community awareness and response is to be achieved. It is not clear whether pricing policies may provide an effective tool for influencing the composition of the diet but this may be an -acditional option for policy makers to consider. 60. The animal fat content of the Chinese diet is on average quite low. It should be kept that way from a general health perspective. This does not mean that continued protein and energy malnutrition should be tolerated in those places where it exists today. Groups and persons with energy (and fat) deficient diets should be targeted for assistance. However, assertions that agricultural and pricing policies should be used to stimulate changes, toward higher fat and protein intake, in the national average diet should be examined with great care. Not only should the financial or economic gains for the state and its enterprises which could result from such changes be considered but also potential adverse health consequences should be evaluated. A shift to grain production for animal feed stocks (other than poultry and fish) is clearly not only an economically inefficient use of grain production but would entail considerable future health costs. 61. In an aging society at risk from chronic disease, the social and health versus financial choices to be made in protecting public health are very similar to those involving occupational safety and health in an environment of growing new industries. Greater regulatory and market roles may have to be played by government to protect future generations of middle aged and elderly from the debilitating effects of diets which are too high in fat. This is one area where China has a zhance to substantially avoid a whole family of chronic diseases which now claim financial resources and lives in the West. 62. The need for, and the main elements, of a disease specific strategy for control of the major effects of the health transition are discussed in Chapter 5 of the Main Report. -6.1 - Annex Chanter 6 HOSPITAL RESOURCES. PLANNING AND MANAGEMENT IN RELATION TO CHRONIC DISEASE Availability of Hosgital Resources 1. Total Hospital Resources. In 1986 China had 59,693 health care institu- tions with a total of 2,296,819 beds and a bed/population ratio of 2.18 beds per 1,000 inhabitants. 68% of the beds are in institutions at county and above county level (see Annex Tables 6.1 and 6.2 at end of Chapter for data on hospital beds by province). These 11,940 health facilities, totaling 1,559,251 beds, count on average 131 beds. The remainder (32%) of the beds are in 47,753 township health centres and comparable institutions which totalled 737,568 beds in 1986 with an average size of 15 beds.11 2. These MOPH statistics do not include the People's Liberation Army hospitals. In recent years, PIA hospital services have been made available to civilians and function up to 75% of their capacity as public hospitals. In total 272 PIA hospitals with 80,000 beds must be added to the current stock of hospital facilities which brings the national bed/population ratio to 2.26/1,000. 3. However, the large majority of the small institutions fail to qualify as hospitals in the sense that they do not provide the basic set of invasive and non-invasive diagnostic and therapeutic services required for critically ill inpatients. Although some of the grass roots institucions that were visited during the mission engage in some hospital functions such as (cosmetic) surgery, electroshock therapy for mental illness, care for cancer patients, etc., it is more realistic to calculate China's hospital bed/population ratio by only taking into account the hospital beds at county and above county level. This brings the national bed/population ratio to 1.58 beds per 1,000 inhabitants. 4. Equity of Access. Hospital provision in relation to population shows marked differences a) between cities and b) between urban and rural areas. 5. Differences Between Cities. For the hospitals reported upon by MOPH the cities (without counties) of more than 500,000 population in 1985 had on average more than 5 beds/l,000 population with a high of 8.8/1,000 in Jinzhou and a low of 3.1/1,000 in Ningbo which are both in the 500,000-1,000,000 category. In the cities of 200,000 to 500,000 population, the average bed/population ratio was 4.4 and ranged from 10.5/1,000 in Jining to 0.6 in Zhongshan (Table 6.2 in Main Report). 6. On average the cities in China have reached or surpassed bed/population ratios which in a number of Western countries are the planning ceilings for Summary of 1986 Chinese Health Statistics. Ministry of Public Health, Beijing, August 1987. -6.2 - acute short-term somatic medical care (exclusive of psychiatric care, long- term geriatric care, care for the mentally or physically handicapped). These planning ceilings for short-term acute somatic care beds are below 4.5 beds per 1,000 population (Annex Table 6.3 below).

Urban/rural Differences. The urban/rural differences in bed supply in China are marked. In 1986, urban provision was 4.48/1,000 beds versus 1.54/1,000 in rural areas. In reality these differences are even greater since the majority of the township health centers and other lower level health care institutions, which hardly qualify as hospitals, tend to be located in rural areas. 8. The People's Liberation Army's hospitals, which are not included in the MOPH data on spatial distribution and which are predominantly located in urban areas, further increase the gap of uneven distribution of hospital facilities betveen urban and rural populations. 9. Hospital ownership is divided among several agencies: a) Health Bureaus at the respective administrative levels (national, provincial-municipality, county/district-prefectural, township); b) Enterprises (e.g. textile, petrochemical, mines, railways); c) the People's Liberation Army; and d) Collectively-Owned hospitals. 10. Between 1981 and 1984 the bed stock in MOPH-hospitals as a share of all hospital beds (with the exclusion of the People's Liberation Army hospitals) rose from 59% to 60%. 11. Enterprise hospitals increased their share from 20% to 21% between 1981 and 1984. Although enterprise hospitals were originally intended and reserved for enterprise workers and their dependents it has increasingly become customary to provide access to the surrounding population. The last to so have been the railway hospitals. -6.3 - 12. Beds in collectively-owned hospitals, as a share of total hospitals beds, decreased from 21% to 18% between 1981 and 1987. 44.700 collectively- owned clinics and hospitals currently offer 423,000 hospital beds. These facilities present a form of private health care. 135,000 private prac- titioners, licensed by the government since 1980, make use of the collec- tively-owned clinics and hospitals. 13. The PLA decreased the ratio of 2.5 beds per 100 soldiers to 2/100 in conjunction with the reduction of the armed forces to 3,000,000 soldiers. In the process, some PLA-hospitals were transferred to the provincial health authorities of the related military district. As noted before PLA hospitals have also become accessible for civilians. 14. TyRes of HosRital. In 1986, 75% of the hospitals at county and above county level were general Western-type hospitals, a decrease of 3% compared to 1984 (see Table 6.3 in Main Report and Annex Table 6.4 below for data on types of hospitals). Traditional Chinese Medicine hospitals represented 13% of the hospitals in 1986 versus 11% in 1984. Specialized hospitals also increased their share from 11% in 1984 to 12% in 1986. The majority of the specialized hospitals are sanatoria, psychiatric hospitals, MCH-centres and infectious disease hospitals (including TB-hospitals). Important to note is the limited number of psychiatric beds! and hospitals. In 1986 there were 374 psychiatric hospitals with a total of 72,717 beds. The bed/population ratio for psychiatric beds is only 0.07/1,000 compared to more than 1/1,000 in the West (Annex Table 6.5). Data on the distribution of beds between acute short- term beds and extended care beds ,.re not available to the MOPH. The long average length of stay in hospitals, the use made of general hospitals as extended care facilities by cadres, and the practice of temporary beds and home beds make it difficult to determine which proportion of current hospital bed capacity is used for acute short-term care and which proportion for long- term care. 15. HosRital size varies widely in China with a range of <15 to >1,200. Data on the distribution of differently sized hospitals are only available as averages. County and above county level hospitals (1,940 facilities, totaling 1,559,251 beds in 1986) count on average 131 beds. The township health centres and comparable facilities (47,753 institutions with a total of 737,568 beds) have on average 15 beds. 21 According to the 2nd Chinese Mental Health Conference, the prevalence of severe mental illness in China is 10.54/1,000 while mild cases account for 22/1,000. Based on a sample survey ir. 1982, held in 12 regions, and using the WHO criteria for classifying me.atal illness, the prevalence of mental illness in China is estimated at 10,000,000 severe cases and 50,000,000 mild cases. In Hangzhou, province of Zhejiang, the 350-bed 7th People's Hospital, formerly called Hangzhou Mental Hospital, has a catchment area of 1.2 million people with an estimated prevalence of 11.7/1,000 cases of severe psychosis. This represents 13,000 cases of which 95% cannot be admitted because of shortage of beds. -6.4 - 16. These averages mask the existence of large and even very large hospitals at city and provincial level and a whole range of medium and small sized hospitals. The large hospitals are mainly the product of incremental expansion. They rarely present a coherent and functionally integrated facility which is operated in an efficient way. The complexity and resulting dys-economies of over-sized facilities, plus the fact that geographical access by the population lowers in proportion with increasing size, is at odds on the one hand with the limited managerial resources available to operate large institutions and on the other hand with the severe constraints on patient transportation (see Annex Box 6.1 below on hospital design).

Research on economies of scale indicates that these are indeed different from what was expected. Unit-costs of hospital service do not decrease in a linear fashion -6.5 - with increasing hospital size but present a U-shaped cost curve. Hospitals can thus be either undersized or oversized. 18. Inefficiency resulting from administrative complexity is mainly responsible for the dys-economies of large institutions. Taking advantage of modern medical technology the provision of humane health care, with:a proximity of the population served, can be efficiently done at sizes under 400 beds. 19. The majority of the specialized hospitals in China are characterized by an average size of 163 beds. 25% of the specialized hospitals have only 100 beds or less (Table 6.3 in Main Report). MCH-centers on average have less than 100 beds.Y Annex Box 6. 1 Hospital SitLng and Design Hospitals ln China often ergged ln renovation ln patient flovs and area needs.

Hospitals in China primarily provide inpatient, outpatient, and emergency care. Few hospitals operate a hospital-based home care program and some report community-oriented outreach programs for disease screening and health maintenance. 21. Inpatient Care. The leading causes for hospital stays have changed since 1955 (Annex Tables 6.6 and 6.7). The national hospital admissions rate (1984) per 10,000 population is about 434 people (including at-home sickbeds; and 429 excluding at-home sickbeds).tThis hospital admission rare ranks low compared to other regions in the world (Annex Table 6.8). National averages for the number of days of hospitalization per person per year are not avail- able. Rates of 1.4 days in Hubei and 1.5 days in Sichuan and Jilin are reported from surveys. These rates are lower than in most countries but comparable to the US (1.7 days/per person in 1981) and Ireland and Greece (1.6 days/per person in 1982).2 Annex Table 6.6 Causes of Hospitalization Illness 88.9 Delivery 10.4 Family Planning 0.4 Recovery 0.3 Source: Survey of urban health services in Hubei, Sichuan, and Jilin Provinces. Ministry of Public Health, 1986. 22. Average length of stay (LOS) of inpatients has gradually increased since 1957 in the hospitals at county and above county level (Annex Table 6.9). This is opposite to the trend abroad but LOS in hospitals abroad was much higher than current LOS in Chinay before it started to shorten (Average LOS in OECD member countries was 26.3 days in 1960 versus 17.9 -lays in 1980-1983). The 1985 survey in three provinces covering 30 hospitals found LOS considerably higher than the national average: 27.7 days in Hubei, 22.8 days in Sichuan and 27.6 days in Jilin. The national average data appear to reflect the much shorter LOS in smaller and lower level hospitals. Most large hospitals seems to approximate European averages of the 1960s. -6.7 - Annex Table 6.7 Annrx T-ble 6.8 10 Leading Diseases as X of Hospital Stays Hospital Admissions per 10,000 Populations Urban Health Depart_mnt Hospitals ln Selected Countries Type of diseLse 1955 1984 Australia (1980) 2100 Austria (1983) 2070 1.

Minlstry of Public Health, 1987. 23. Hospital occupancy, with the exception of enterprise hospitals and small hospitals, tends to be high (Annex Tables 6.10 and 6.11).Y Demand for inpatient care far outstrips the available bed capacity.!Y The pressure on the higher level hospitals partly results from self-referral by patients to a better equipped institution which is not the contract-unit they are supposed to go to.Y Because of higher rural incomes, better equipment of higher level hospitals, relaxation of professional referral and reimbursement procedures, people seek care higher up thereby crowding those facilities while lower level institutions may be less occupied. In turn unavailability of vacant beds at Small sized hospitals suffer from low occupancy rates in general. In China, this partly results from the population seeking direct admission to higher level hospitals but also because of inherent characteristics of being small sized. The stochastic nature of events requiring hospital admission produces greater variation between over- and under- occupancy, and on average lower occupancy rates, in small sized institutions than in larger institutions. This phenomenon tends to increase with reduction in average length of stay. A survey in Beijing and Tianjin indicated that 0.8 million patients could not be admitted because of lack of beds. The 1985 urban health care survey in three provinces demonstrated that of the 2,500 people suffering an illness in the two-week survey period, 55.48% sought treatment in a non-contract unit. The majority of these went to higher level institutions (Municipal hospitals, provincial hospitals, teaching hospitals). -6.8 - higher level hospitals is a frequent reason preventing admission of outpatients requiring hospitalization.!V 24. Outpatient care. Hospitals in China carry a large load of outpatients. In county and above county hospitals in 1986 there were 56 outpatients and emergency visits for every admission versus 63 in township hospitals. More than half of the visits to hospital outpatient and emergency departments occur in hospitals at county and above county level (Annex Table 6.12).

Emergency Care. Nationwide data on the incidence of emergencies needing treatment are not available, but available statistics indicate that the incidence of emergencies due to trauma and poisoning is high. 26. The emergency care situation is considered by the Ministry of Public Health as deficient in all its main components: (a) communications, (b) resuscitation & life-saving intervention, (c) transport, and (d) appropriate emergency care. Only a few cities have introduced a toll free emergency number: 120. Provision of ambulance services is insufficient and the limited number of ambulances are not always fully operational.Y Neither are existing ambulances suited for conditions in China. The narrow lanes in the cities prohibit maneuvering of imported wide-bodied ambulances. Domestically made vehicles are too harshly sprung and poorly configured. 27. To improve the potential for extra-mural resuscitation and life-saving interventions, actions are being undertaken in many localities to diffuse among lay people the understanding of, and the proficiency in, applying basic life saving techniques and first aid measures. Y1 Analysis of one day's outpatient departments' activity in the 30 hospitals of the urban health care survey showed that, among 16,177 outpatient and emergency visits, 145 patients needing admission could not be hospitalized. Of these, 56% failed to be admitted at municipal hospitals. Y/ The majority of emergencies arrive on foot (Annex Table 6.13). -6.9 - Annex Table 6.10 Hospital Occupancy at County Level and Above County Level Year 1957 1975 1986 All hospitals 80.3% 83.5% 82.8% 80.6% Source: Chinese Health Statistical Digest 1986, Ministry of Public Health, Beijing, 1987.

Only a limited number of hospitals and a few cities (e.g. Beijing) have disaster plans. The development of specialized emergency care units (burn units, units for trauma victims or units for poison victims) has not resulted from MOPH guided area- wide planning. They rather developed around special expertise or within hazardous industrial settings. In the latter case they tend to be a standby capacity with the risk of underuse. -6.10 - Annex Table 6.12 limber of visits nd Zmergency Depart2 nts, 1986 Number of visLts in thousands County end above county hospitals 1,218,250 Health sector 754,360 Enterprins and other sector 395,630 Collective ownership 68,260 Township Health Centres 1,077,730 Other hospital 53,110 Total 2,349,090 SourceX Chinese Health Statistical Digest 19a6, Mllnstry of Publlc Health, 1987.

Ministry of Health, BeLijng, 1986. 29. It is common for local and provincial health and planning authorities to think that in the development of an appropriate emergency care system first priority should be given to strengthening the communication and transport components. Experience in China and other countries has proven that all elements of an emergency care system must be developed in balance and well coordinated in order to avoid the co-existence of bottlenecks and idle capacities. NOPH policies reflect this balanced approach but diffusion of these concepts and their acceptance by local authorities and by planning and finance agencies has been slow. 30. Home Beds. Hospital-based home care programs are being developed so that beds at home are used to substitute for inpatient care. In 1984 there were 488,389 home beds in operation throughout the country. Expansion of the use of home beds is constrained because of long distance between hospitals and patient homes, shortage of hospital staff, and lack of transport for home visits. Low care facilities called temporary beds have also been installed by certaini hospitals either on hospital premises or off-site. Some hospitals use near-by hotels for housing patients under investigation or treatmcnt. -6.11 - 31. Screenin g for ic Disease. Most hospitals report an increase in screening activities in recent years. These screening activities have enabled the MOPH to establish rough measures of the burden of morbidity due to a number of chronic diseases in particular segments of the population. Hypertension, cervical cancer, breast cancer, ischaemic heart disease, cerebrovascular disease, pneumoconiosis, and physical handicaps were among the most surveyed. In most cases the surveys were used also to undertake secondary prevention measures. Only occasionally, however, was the high cost of case finding recognized. Most hospitals continue to emphasize the further expansion of effort for detecting cancers at an early stage without adequate attention to cost effectiveness of screening efforts or to eventual prognosis of cases found. 32. Health Maintenance Programs. All hospitals report token activities or participation in programs aimed at primary prevention. Modest programs to change food habits and smoking habits stand out among those mentioned. Outpatients and accompanying relatives are exposed to health maintenance messages and posters although smoking is allowed on hospital premises and by hospital staff. The Beijing Heart, Lung and Blood Vessel Medical Center claims to be the first non-smoking hospital in the country. Hospital Management 33. Patient Care Management. Rational use of existing facilities and shortening of the average Length of Stay (LOS), given the shortage of hospital beds, is a key management issue in Chinese hospitals. Available data based on different disease classification systems and different age structures of patient populations only allow for tentative comparisons of LOS between China and the West (Table 6.5 in Main Report). However, the extended working week whereby diagnostic and treatment interventions for non-emergencies are routine on Saturdays and Sundays skews even further the comparison of the reported Chinese LOS with Western practice.i0' 34. Reducing LOS could contribute towards absorbing waiting lists and unmet demand. It could also help defer capital investment for expansion of facilities. The following factors affect LOS in China and those marked with * are susceptible to managerial intervention to effect improvements: a. Severity of cases is alleged to explain the longer LOS at higher level hospitals compared to county level or below hospitals. A comparison of similar case types among hospital levels may be reveal.ng. MY A comparison with the West of LOS for leading causes of admission expressed in ICD9-CM diagnoses for similar age groups and sex, and including information on surgical intervention and payment coverage status would help to clarify to what degree !OS in China is excessive and amenable to reduction. The Bureau of Medical Administration of the MOPH may wish to commission a study on this as part of its policy analysis function. -6.12 - b. Cases of extended care* which in the West would reside in alter- nate sitings such as nursing homes, rehabilitation facilities, convalescent homes or even home care are often reported.111 Hospital-based home care initiatives as a mechanism for early discharge exist but hospital managers point to the large untapped potential of this type of alternative siting of inpatient care because of a lack of transportatitin for attending physicians and the distant housing of patients eligible for early discharge. c. Traditional Chinese Medicine hospitals* have a LOS which is sig- nificantly longer than in Western medicine hospitals. This is claimed to be explained by the fact that more chronically ill patients select TCM hospitals. TCM patients in a Western medicine hospital also tend to have longer LOS than the hospital's average. It is not clear to what extent the mixing of Western medicine and TCM, which occurs frequently, contributes to lengthening overall LOS and to what extent the longer LOS of TCM is attributable to illness rather than other factors. d. Treatment Dlans* ordered by physicians tend to be longer than those for similar cases in the West (e.g. 11 days for uncompli- cated appendicitis versus 8 in the OECD). Target LOS and dis- charge quota by diagnosis or medical specialty are being intro- duced experimentally in DRG type schemes.jV e. Pre-admission diagnostics* are utilized only experimentally but offer considerable promise to reduce LOS by 2 or 3 days. It is not clear to what extent day-surgery, ambulatory invasive diagnostics or treatment, and day care are practiced or considered. 1Y Typical of this problem is the Provincial Hospital of Shandong where 52 beds were occupied in 1986 by aged cadres with an average stay of 117.7 days and 75 beds were occupied by cases of occupational poisoning for 111.9 days on average. Y Disease Related Group (DRG) diagnosis and payment schemes have been used with mixed results to attempt to control hospital costs by taking away incentives for the hospital to keep a patient in bed longer than medically necessary. Different experiments in Chinese hospitals with this approach are underway. For example, in Shaoxing 2nd People's hospital, a 3 Yuan bonus is awarded '..o physicians for every patient discharged above the target discharge quota. In the absence of good clinical audit and hospital practice audit procedures such incentives may pose risks to patients. -6.13 - f. Schduling* of patient care and optimum capacity use of diagnostic and therapeutic facilities are important factors in LOS.A Bottlenecks in patient flow resulting from inoperative or insufficient numbers of diagnostic or therapeutic equipments are reported by hospitals as justification for further equipment purchases. Yet often, intensive care units have few real, inten- sive care patients. The rest of the beds have disconnected monitors and their patients rather belong in a medium-care or even a self-care unit. It is tempting to speculate on the role that higher prices for intensive cpie play in this use pattern. Imaging and treatment roomis are seldom occupied intensively by patients. Hospitals report capacity use of diagnostic and therapeutic facilities of only 6 hours a day during 6 days a week on average. g. Hosoital acquired comRlications,* in particular hospital infec- tions and accidents, are contributing in all countries to extended LOS. Given the cramped and often cluttered conditions for circulation, the presence of rodents, the limited use of pressured steam sterilizers, the scarcity of single-use sterilized items, the spreading use of antibiotics and the absence of explicit infection control and accident prevention measures, it can be presumed that infections and accidents contribute to an increase in LOS. Hospitals often report a \"zero\" rate of \"hospital acquired\" infections. This is simply not credible. h. Post-discharge situations, especially distant and sub-standard housing were invoked as a frequent reason to extend patient stay beyond strict medical needs. This suggests the need to explore with imagination, alternatives for intermediate care arrangements. i. User-induced overuse* is clearly a partial explanation for the longer LOS in higher level hospitals. Loss of income for peasants as a result of hospitalization provides an incentive to reduce LOS contrary to enterprise and government workers whose coverage status and replacement income during sickness has the opposite effect. 35. Oualitv Assuraace and Risk Management. Management for quality assurance is being recognized as important. Certain specific programs are being introduced while others such as utilization review, peer review, infection control, radiation control, and accidents control, are inoperative or just beginning in a few places. 1W A study of LOS in Nol Attached Hospital in Beijing found waiting periods averaging between 3 to 11 days from the end of pre-operative check-up to the day of actual surgery. Che Chuen Feng et al., Primary analysis of factors influencing average length of stay. Hospital Management in China, vol. 3:4, 1987, pp. 199-201. -6.14 - 36. The Civilized Hospital Program (CHP) is an accreditation type program which started in 1985. Hospitals are evaluated against a set of more than 100 criteria with respect to a) quality of care, b) attitudes of hospital staff towards patients, c) cleanliness of hospital premises, and d) management. Hospitals do internal self-assessment on a 1000 point scale twice a year. At the end of each year, the related Health Bureau makes an external evaluation. In the process, hospital premises are visited, patients and staff are interviewed, medical records are inspected and treatment processes are evaluated. Hospitals which score higher than 900 points are reported to the Provincial Health Bureau as eligible for the Civilized Hospital Certificate. Nationwide the CHP certificate has been awarded to 15% of the hospitals at county and above county level and to 8% at below county level. Recipient hospitals receive a reward of \u00b1 50,000 Yuan. 37. The National Centar for Clinical Laboratory Service (NCCLS), established in 1982, considers clinical laboratory service as the weakest link in Chinese hospital medicine. The NCCLS has been charged with the development of a reference laboratory and guidelines for hospital laboratories. Funds however are lacking. The NCLS reports laboratory quality is poor because of defective equipment, poorly trained and insufficient manpower. 38. A national quality assessment program for clinical chemistry was started in 1981 in 5 hospitals in each province on 11 items provided in a WHO sample. Only 39% of the tests were found acceptable. Since then, each province has initiated its own survey next to the internal survey in each hospital. 400 hospitals continue to participate in the national survey. Acceptability of tests has risen to 78.1% with glucose as one of the best items at 85% acceptability. Acceptability is said to be stagnating primarily because certain equipment like domestic colorimeters are unreliable. Bacteriology testing started in 1983 and sensitivity has improved from 50% at the onset to 80-90%. Regional centers will in the future advise provincial authorities and hospitals on the procurement of sophisticated laboratory equipment. 39. Hospitals do ntt have formal arrangements for infection control and related inappropriate use of antibiotics. A Program of Surveillance and Control of Nosocomial Infection has recently been started by the MOPH. A preliminary survey on nosocomial infection in 21 hospitals for 1983 indicated that the incidence of hospital acquired infection was 8.4% (Annex Table 6.14). Misuse of antibiotics must be a substantial problem by virtue of the volume and multiplicity of agents used.W4 No official data is yet available but this is an obvious area for careful study under MOPH guidance.

Hospital Facilities Management. Representative data on the age and the state of maintenance of hospital facilities are not available. A significant fraction of urban hospitals date from before the 1949 period. A large part of the total stock of hospitals were constructed in the early fifties. Both groups of buildings are characterized by less than 30 m2 floor space per bed. Their technical infrastructure is limited and poorly maintained. Wooden staircases and floors, and the absence of escape staircases present serious fire hazards particularly in those institutions dating from before the Liberation. 41. Newer facilities average 40m2 per bed. Storage space is extremely limited and working and circulation areas are cluttered with out-of-order equipment and discarded containers. Distribution of oxygen is basically provided with bazardous bottles. Horizontal circulation and in particular patient transportation are often hampered by small door-ways, steep slopes or stairs, malfunctioning elevators and by the absence of covered circulation lay-outs between individual buildings. 42. Deficiencies in plumbing and poor isolation of wet areas cause rapid deterioration of outside walls, ceilings and inside partitions plus fungus growth in patient areas. The technical characteristics of surfaces (floors, walls and ceilings) in areas which have to be dustfree and which must be regularly subjected to antiseptic scrubbing (operating rooms, ICUs, neonatal care, burn units etc.) are often not adequate. Measures for energy conservation have not been implemented in the design, construction, materials used and the finishing of the buildings. Patient areas are often unheated. Mortality due in part to hypothermia is never reported but obviously must occur, not infrequently, during winter months. 43. Maintenance budgets are wholly inadequate for such an aging hospital stock and even the amount nominally spent on maintenance is often spent on -6.16 - small additions to physical plant and on purchases of new equipment, especially those items which enhance revenue earning activities. 44. Overall, the existing stock of hospital facilities are in very poor condition and are being allowed to deteriorate further. The general, traditional propensity toward capital construction in China appears to be exploited by some by allowing existing buildings to deteriorate so that new capital construction can be justified. Examples abound of relatively new hospitals which are ill-designed, wrongly located in relation to the populace, un-needed in relation to other nearby capacity and which are equipped and managed in ways which only drive health care costs higher. 45. Hos.ital Information Systems. The development of hospital information systems is limited. Patient-related information is available in medical records and various logbooks in diagnostic and treatment areas. Some diagnostic or procedure related information is retrieved for management purposes. Abstracting of medical records for purposes of utilization review, planning, inter-hospital comparison, case-mix adjustment etc. is not customary. Resource data, resource utilization data, and production data are available but not in a standardized way. Financial data are structured around type of income or expenditure. Relating cost data to hospital products such as cases or product lines is not practiced. Use of microcomputers for managerial,purposes is rather exceptional. 46. Management Resources. Since the end of the Cultural Revolution, Party Cadres have been replaced, as hospital administrators, by clinicians. The director is presented as a general manager and referred to as the ultimate decision-maker with respect to hospital affairs such as investment choices, operating policies, negotiations with the local health bureau and other relevant authorities etc. This development has recently been enforced by stressing the director-responsibility system and related authority and accountability. 47. A series of deputy-directors (up to 5) assist the director. This situation possibly reflects a more representative role and a task as arbiter for the director within a participative management model. It contrasts with the CEO-role which is customary in North-America and increasingly so in Europe. The deputy-directors are responsible for ouch respective areas as Finance, Procurement, Personnel, General Affairs. This portfolio-type of management of the hospitals probably contributes to the described role of the director and to a certain diffusion of managerial responsibility. Accountability for problems in the hospitals often is hard to determine and committee structures seem to prevail over line-structures. Middle management structures based on inpi.t types such as nursing directors, nursing supervisors and nursing unit managers for the nursing resource inputs, or medical directors for the medical staff inputs, seem absent. Chiefs of services are clinicians of the respective medical disciplines. They are responsible for unit management. Recently, their accountability for balancing departmental budgets has been stressed by the technical responsibility system and by bonuses on departmental output. In vie- of the financial trends described in Chapter 9, China should examine the management situation carefully. It may well be that during the last five years China has been paying much more for -6.17 - lesser quality hospital care which benefit relatively fewer people than in the past. 48. The general tendency to use practicing physicians as managers is defended with the argument that this provides a guarantee that medical expertise is continuously available for management decisions. The drain or scarce medical resources which would otherwise be available for patient care and the regular conflict of interests between patient care requirements and management duties (and financial incentives) are acknowledged but considered not to outweigh the advantage of having practicing physicians in control. In view of the findings throughout this report, this position would seem to be in need of careful review. 49. Outside China, only the USSR and a number of Eastern European countries have the explicit policy to fill all management positions with physicians. In other countries lay managers, usually specially trained for health services management, are in charge. On average, they provide better analytical skills and also special expertise in well defined management areas. Officials at MOPH consider the situation of clinician-managers as temporary and in line with the general economic reforms where, also in industry, administrative cadres were replaced by professionally qualified persons working in the sector. It is expected that in a next stage properly trained health care managers, with or without a medical background, will gradually replace the clinician-managers. 50. Management Education. Since the early 1980s, seven Training Centers for Health Services Administration have been established ir medical schools.Af In addition, there are about 40 medical colleges in which programs for Health Services Administration have been introduced. Short-term, in-service courses are also offered but are reported by participants to be too theoretical. 51. Since health care uanagement is so far not recognized as a professional category and since manager positions are rotated, clinicians hesitate and show reluctance to invest in management training. The State Commission on Education is considering to recognize health care nmanagement as a separate professional category. The main weaknesses of health care management education in China are seen in faculty qualifications, lack of health services research, and in the fact that hospital management is not attractive to physicians.Le 15 Beijing Medical University, Shanghai Medical University, Tonji Medical University (Wuhan), Western China Medical University (Chengdu), Xian Medical University, Harbin Medical University and the College of Traditional Chinese Medicine in Beijing. N The Chinese Association of Hospital Management plays a role in management education. Created in 1980 it is involved, through its provincial permanent secretariats, in research and management education. It also publishes a management journal and is seeking affiliation with the International Hospital Federation. A joint international hospital management seminar was recently held with the American Hospital -6.18 - Hosy.Jtal Planning 52. The MOPH plans to yearly increase the number of hospital beds by 80,000 throughout the Seventh, Eight and Ninth Five Year Plans (Annex Table 6.15 beloa). The Seventh Five Year Plan (1986-1990) states: \"1. We shall build more key hospitals. During the period of tho plan we shall increase the number of hospital beds by 400,000. The state will allocate funds to build 16 general hospitals, each specializing in one or more branches of medicine, and two modern hospitals with advanced equipment and techniques\". The 18 key hospital projects are financed specially by the State Planning Commission. Most of the investment are in reconstruction of existing facilities, each of which is about 800-1,000 beds. F'ive of the 18 key hospitals are at central level and the remainder at provincial or municipal level. It is noc clear that these high level hospitals can, or are intended to, serve more than a very selected segment of the population, with few downward linkages and little in the way of replicable exarple. Such large, high level hospitals will certainly entail higher costs, and patterns of higher technology interventions which have little relevance to most of China's health needs for the next half century. 53. The overall hospital bed target of 400,000 beds per Five Year Plan is based on provincial investment plans. Each province uses different planning criteria and the MOPH does not specify appropriatc criteria. Analysis of the national hospital statistics indicates that the stock of hospital beds increased from 2,165,519 in 1984 to 2,296,819 in 1986 which is 28,700 short of the target during the related years of the Seventh Plan. 54. The planning and related targets are indicative rather than imperative and seem primarily determined by financial feasibility. Selected elements of indicative planning are that 20% of the national hospital bed target will be for Traditional Chinese Medicine, that 20-25% of the bed stock expansion will be provided by the enterprLse sector, that each administrative unit at county level and above should have a TCM hospital, anG that each provincial capital should have a cancer hospital. The financial implications of these elements, the obvious risk of duplication of capacity, of a basis toward high technology and of yet further escalations in health costs are obvious and should be of concern in light of the findings in Chapter 9 of the Main Report. Association and the American College of Health Care Executives. An Association of Chinese Hjalth Care Management Education Programs with the goal of Faculty development, as was developed in other parts of the world, is probably a logical next step. -6.19 - Annex Table 6.15 Year Population Number Beds Increas,e Population (in 1000s) /1000 of beds 1990 1,116,250 2,629,219 1995 1,192,220 3,029,219 2.56 3,429,219 2.75 400,000 55. The \"1/3 County\" program intended to update and renovate successive thirds of the county hospitals, over a number of years, has fallen behind schedule. Priorities in allocating expansion of hospital capacity are given to existing hospitals at the higher provincial and municipal-prefectural level. These investment choices are rationalized on the basis of poor quality of service currently being provided at county and below county level hospitals. This results in incremental growth of large institutions and no redressing of the basic problems at the lower levels. There does not seem to exist a defined strategy for an articulated (both horizontally and vertically) and balanced hospital system. The tendency of local Health Bureaus to develop hospitals coterminous with every administrative sub-division of the country and the fact that hospitals are being developed by various owners, independently from each other, result in a fragmented and multi-tiered hospital system. As a result China virtually has five levels of hospitals: at township/neighborhood level at county/district level at municipal/prefectural level at provincial/municipality level at national level. 56. In other countries either a two-level hospital system [medium-sized (200-300 beds) and large hospitals (500-900 beds)] or maximum three-level hospital system [small sized (100-150 beds), medium-sized (200-300 beds) and large hospital (500-900 beds) exists. Establishment is not linked to administrative level, but to population served. 57. To counter the fragmented development of uncoordinated hospital resources, a number of countries have defined Health Regions within which the development, deployment and functioning of health facilities is analyzed, guided, coordinated, re-directed, re-structured, re-allocated. These Health Regions override the existing geographical administrative boundaries of a country and contain in principle a population base (between 1 to 4.5 million) large enough to allow a self-contained comprehensive set of all basic and referral care facilities required by the population in the region and deployed within acceptable proximity of those served. 58. Where possible, Health Regions can be defined as coterminous with the nearest administrative subdivision of the country. This is particularly indicated for remote areas and for densely populated metropolitan areas. Where not possibie, Health Region boundaries cut across existing -6.20 - administrative boundaries. Examples of countries which have introduced Health RAgions are: Sweden, France, the United Kingdom, The Netherlands, the United States, Italy. 59. The degree to which Health Region Authoritiev!iZ are capable the enforce the region-wide planning and coordination of health facilities differs between countries: Sweden which has the longest tradition of Health Regions is a country with extremes in population density and yet it has reached full control over regional health resources d-.,oyment. In the USA on the contrary some 200 health planning areas were designated in 1978 and the health planning area authorities have not gone beyond the stage of situation analysis and partial use of \"certificate-of-need\" regulation to control capital investment and the deployment of expensive technology. Role of Hosoitals in Disease Proarams 60. The role hospitals in China should play in preventing and treating chronic illnesses effectively and efficiently is of utmost importance. The combined effects of a) China's first health revolution during which infectious diseases were substantially reduced within a short timespan, and b) its effective birth control program, have resulted in a \"mortality down-morbidity up\" situation potentially compounded by fundamental changes in family composition. What is important in the changed mortality pattern is the fundamentally changed morbidity situation confronting health care in general and hospitals in particular. There is a larger underlying morbidity burden reflecting the mortality pattern of the chronic diseases discussed in Chapter I. In addition, mental 'Ulness, apart from suicide, and rheumatoid or other \"crip.ling\" diseases, whiie rarely the direct cause of death present substantial hospital care requirements. A conservative estimate claims that more than 20% of all hospital beds in Europe are occupied by victims of 'crippling\" diseases or by mental patients. Within the next decade the same may well be true in China. 61. There is no doubt that China must increase its stock of hospitals and beds. It must also clearly rehabilitate and upgrade its existing stock of medical care institutions. When, and how, to do this are issues which must be tempered by careful consideration of how to improve the efficiency of these same institw.-ions and how to control their costs and to ration equitable access to them. A simple response which stresses expansion of hospital bed capacity cannot possibly work. The implicit demands of over a billion people, with present managerial practices and easily foreseeable illness patterns, will overwhelm any imaginable response of the Chinese economy and the government's budget to simply construct more hospitals (public or private) and 1Y In recent years Health Regions have in principle also been defined to contain all educational and trainiaLg institutions required to provide the health manpower for the Health Region. Sweden, France, Cuba, and the Netherlands are examples of countries which are developing Regionalized Health Manpower Education housed in institutions which at the same time serve as the referral centres in the regionalized health services research. -6.21 - to use them in the same way as they are at present. Alternatively, to simply raise the price of admission as the means of reducing this demand will surely be unacceptable to the generations of middle aged and elderly who have struggled to form a nation and to build its skeleton. On them a very heavy burden has already fallen and to simply ignore those among them whose incomes are not adequate to the challenge, and admit without restriction those who are fortunate to be insured, would be contrary to fundamental social goals in all but the most venal of societies. Likewise, to borrow heavily (domestically or abroad) as other nations have done to provide social care today at the expense of the productivity of future generations is unlikely to be acceptable to China for a number of reasons. 62. Yet a middle way, combining features of all three of these extreme alternatives must be found, and initiated, fairly quickly as the present course is resulting in a worsening situation. In addition, internal reforms and adjustments to a wide range of medical care practices and incentives must be made for hospitals to improve their cost effectiveness and efficacy regardless of the main path chosen for the longer term. Some of these changes are likely to be resisted by those in hospitals, some by the government bureaucracy responsible for health care, some by the insured, and even some will be resisted by the patients who pay their own costs. Without consensus on a new course, and a clearly defined, and new, set of goals for hospitals the massive existing system is likely to inexorably consume increasing amounts of economic resources, with little discernable impact on the health status of the nation. The experience of other nations with escalating health care costs, mainly for hospital services, should provide China unarguable evidence of this. These themes are examined in greater detail in Chapter 4's exploration of possible future directions. 1.

The issue of technology is critical for the health care system of any country.9/ It offers a major tool for improving the health of the population now and in the future. Public policies, especially in health care payments and financing, strongly influence the adoption and use of medical technology. In countries where costs of health care have been growing rapidly, an issue of growing importance and visibility is the choice of cost-effective technology. Choices can be assisted by collection of data on specific technologies, through methods that have come to be known as technology assessment. 2. In most industrialized countries, a complex of policies have developed that influence medical technology. Drugs are regulated to assure efficacy (benefits) and safety, usually by a premarketing approval process. Increasingly, medical devices are regulated in similar fashion, although these policies are less developed in almost all coun;-ries. Certain expensive, and also imported technologies are usually subject to regulatory and planning authorities; for example, in many countries a hospital must seek a license from the government to buy specialized equipment, such as computed tomography (CT) scanners, or to provide a service, such as clinical genetics. Finally, government insurance plans, private insurance companies, and illness funds generally have explicit benefit packages that indicate what services can be provided and how much the payment will be. These packages in effect define a form of technology regulation by financiers of health care. 3. The diffusion of western medicine and technologies in China has been rapid and extensive (see Attachment 1 on the history, policies, and current situation, at the back of this annex chapter). China's policies toward planning, organization, and payment for medical services have been developed in light of earlier social and economic goals, with little attention to the issue of technology. In light of future health needs and the trends in health costs it may be time for these policies to be explicitly examined for their effects on medical technology. 4. The evaluation of the effectiveness, safety, and costs of new and traditional drugs and equipment technologies for diagnosis, treatment, and prevention is assuming much greater importance because of the high costs involved. Few such studies have been done in China. Incl ded ir Attachment 2 to this chapter are simple case studips (vignettes) outlining approximate costs and the apparent issues to be considered by China as it develops its technology assessment policies. These are not meant to provide definitive analysis and final answers but to stimulate further investigation and analysis in potentially important areas. 9/ Technology is knowledge applied to specific purposes. Medical technology may be defined as the drugs, devices, and medical and surgical procedures used in health care. In addition, management and supportive technologies may be considered a part of medical technology. -7.2 - 5. An important related issue for the future is how to plan for technology to meet future health needs. As described ii Chapters 1 and 2, the increasing crude prevalence rates of cardirvascular disease, cerebrovascular disease, cantcer, and injuries have already fostered a demand for investment in modern technologies and this will surely continue. The choices for the future are of critical importance. Balanced investment in prevention, diagnosis, treatment, rehabilitation, and long-term care is essential. For this purpose, China needs to improve its knowledge of the relative merits of different technological choices and its ability to plan and regulate these. 6. Sources of Domestic Medical Technology. A numbAr of government units operate enterprises -Ath the task of producing drugs and medical equipment in China. The most important is the State Pharmaceutical Administration of China (SPAC). The great majority of the 1452 drug manufac- turers are under the SPAC and its provincial and local components; a few come under the agriculture ministry or other government bodies. Since 1979, the SPAC has supervised the manufacture of both pharmaceuticals and medical instruments. Its National Medical Instrument Corporation is in charge of policy, regulations, and guidelines concerning research, production, distribution, import, and export of medical instruments; its National Pharmaceutical Corporation is responsible for production of drugs; its National Drug Corporation is responsible for marketing of drugs; and its National Herbal Medicine Corporation is responsible for overseeing production of traditional Chinese medicines. The SPAC also operates three colleges of pharmacy, three research academies, and a variety of other organizations. The Ministry of Public Health-i produces biological products such as vaccines and a variety of serological products and reagents in five institutes. (Additional detaAled information, including information on SPAC, and on imports and domestic prodtuction, is presented at the end of this annex, in the section on the history and policies of medical technologies.) 7. Drugs. While China is essentially self-sufficient in drugs, the 1984 Pharmaceutical Law gave the Bureau of Drug Policy and Administration of the MOPH authority to restrict imported drugs and to regulate the quality of drugs (purity, safety and efficacy). Under the Bureau, the Drug and Biological Production and Quality Control Institute and its sub-units at all levels of government have the responsibility for contrclling production, supply and utilization of drugs. The law provides that MOPH must certify that the drug is needed before it can be imported. Imports of diagnostic reagents, radiography materials, some antibiotics, and some cancer chemotherapy drugs, are also regulated under this system. 8. There are quality control problems, as would be expected in any country of China's size. However, these appear to be handled reascnably well by the quality control systems which have been initiated since the 1984 -7.3 - Pharmaceutical Law. Major problems remaining for China's health system regarding drugs revolve around two issues -overuse and inappropriate use.!/ 9. Access to drugs is not a problem at any level. The utilization of pharmaceuticals is quite high; the value of drugs would account for about 50% of total health expenditure; Western drugs alone would account for about 35% of total health expenditure. An average of 2.3 drugs are prescribed at each patient visit. There are two apparent reasons for this high rate Polyphar- macy practices seem preferred by doctor and patient alike in order to ensure that cure is effected. In this aspec Ihina is not different from many other countries and the remedy lies in better physician education, clearer and stricter prescribing protocols, occasional hospital drug audits by department and by doctor, and widespread public education about the dangers and inefficiencies of polypharmacy. The second reason for over-utilization is that of payment policies and financial incentives for practitioners and institutions alike (see Chapter 9 and Boxes 9.2 and 9.3 in Main Report). 10. Medical Equipment. China encourages the manufacture of medical instruments and equipment and has an extensive industry under the guidance of the National Medical Instrument Corporation. The National Commission on Machinery has similar responsibilities for equipment that is not medical, but may be needed in the health care system, such as computers, vehicles, and laundry equipment. The Ministry of Electronic Industry also is involved in the manufacture of certain electronic devices that may be required in the health care system (e.g. pacemalers, cathode ray monitoring systems, etc.). 11. Medical devices are generally not regulated for quality in China. Partly as a result of this situation domestically-produced medical equipment has quality problems. Many doctors and hospitals consider Chinese-made equipment satisfactory if the technology is not -Rplex. But in more complex areas they indicate that domestically producer : ms have lower technical specifications and less reliability than do mos imported equilpment. These quality problems are acknowledged by the SPAC. (More detailed information on medical equipment, quality problems, distribution, shortages, maintenance experience and regulatory and policy aspects is contained in the attachment to this annex chapter). 12. Distributional Aspects of Eguipment. Provincial hospitals are generally fairly well-equipped and township hospitals and rural clinics are generally poorly equipped. Otherwise, there do not seem to be any consistent patterns. Municipal hospitals are sometimes very well-equipped, and sometimes badly equipped. In general, equipment in district and prefectural hospitals 2/ Overuse and inappropriate use of drugs may be illustrated by the care of a patient with pneumonia in a village clinic in Shaanxi Province. The patient was treated with penicillin, streptomycin, gentamycin, tetracycline, and prednisonei This combination of drugs is considered just as inappropriate by Chinese experts as it would be in Western countries, and yet such misuse occurs frequently, to some degree because of incentives. -7.4 - is scanty, and what is available is often old. Quite sophisticated technology can sometimes be found in a county-level hospital in one or two departments, and hi;h-level hospitals sometimes lack rather important tools such as vacuum sterilizers. 13. Little equipment-specific information is available concerning capital investment in hospital equipment in China. The investment per bed is small, however. In 1987, ti.e Ministry carried out a survey concerning selected pieces of equipment in 13 medical universities and 33 affiliated hospitals. Overall results from the survey are presented in the attachment to t'nis annex chapter. In general, an impressive number of pieces of diagnostic equipment exist in these institutions; equipment resources at lower-level institutions are generally much weaker. 14. For the most sophisticated technologies, China is only beginning to experience the rapid diffusion which has affected many developed nations. For example, the MOPH estimates that there were 170 CT scanners in China in 1986. These are unevenly distributed across the country, with the highest number by population in Beijing, with 27, a rate of about 2.9 per million population (by early 1988, Beijing was said to have 34 scanners). Shaanxi Province, with a population of 29 million, has 3 CT scanners.?/ 15. Regulation of Technology. There has been little regulation of medical technology thus far in China with the exception of a program for radiological equipment and services (for more information on regulation, and on X-ray services in China in particular, see the attachment to this annex chapter). Laboratory standardization and calibration activities are scattered and remain to be rigorously developed. Programs for the regulation of other medical technology, for safety, efficacy and accuracy, have not yet emerged. 16. There seems to be a general desire in many institutions to increase sophistication of diagnosis with relatively little attention to the contribution of the technology to the efficiency of therapy or to the outcome for the patient. At the same time, there is a shortage of well-trained diagnostic technicians. China is also experiencing, as many countries have, some over-emphasis on sophisticated diagnostic approaches because medical education emphasizes laboratory practices in basic science courses early in medical school and student develop an untempered fondness for high techno- logies. Electro-Encephalography (EEC) is used in almost every hospital. Diagnostic ultrasound is surprisingly prevalent. Digital subtraction angiography is beginning to diffuse into the system. t/ There are al_o now several MRI scanners in China and several renal lithotrypters, (and China now has produced a domestically-made prototype machine that is being tested). In general, higher technologies are utilized intensively in China. Hsiao and Tsai (198E' confirm this impression with a report of 9 CT scanners in Shanghai, reporting utilization as high as 7076 scans a year (in general, a scanner would be expected to do at least 3000 scans on a one-shift basis). -7.5 - 17. Some of the most common medical technologies in use in China are already widely diffused throughout the hea.th system; others are still in early stage. There are many questionable technology investments, especially in diagnostic equipment. For example, vectorcardiographs and polygraphs for collecting data on multiple cardiac functions are employed with surprising frequency, considering the limited clinical usefulness of these machines. Electronic fetal monitoring, which is not known to be of medical value, is also beginning to spread rapidly in China. 18. Moreover, outmoded diagnostic equipment is in widespread use, especially in cardiology. In addition to vectorcardiographs, ballistocardiographs and cerebral resistance measuring machines should be removed from service in order to prevent further waste of resources. Fluoroscopy should be phased out, both in the interests of protection of patients and workers from radiation, and because it is an inefficient diagnostic procedure. Overall, the situation argues strongly in favor of a strengthened role for MOPH to do technology assessment and regulation. The attachment contains a brief review of the status and issues surrounding important ancillary technology services for blood banks, laboratories, etc. in the health system (see section on history, policies, current situation). Evaluation of Technologv 19. Appropriate management of technology in China cannot be ac- complished only through price levers. Complicating China's task is the fact that this is the time of the most rapid technological change in history. Medicine in the last 40 years has seen great change, and such change will probably even accelerate during the next 40 years. Present medical practice is rather primitive in many respects, and new technology may be more effective and often more cost-effective. China should not follow Western patterns uncritically. The patterns of medical practice found presently in China tend to reflect Western practice of 10-20 years ago. China could save itself mistakes and money by rapidly accepting new medical technologies when they are obviously cost-effective. For example, lasers are rapidly finding a place in vascular surgery. Rather than investing in manpower and facilities for coronary artery bypass surgery, China may be well-advised to examine the experience with lasers and perhaps to begin to invest in this promising new technology. In other areas too, procedures previously done by surgeons can now be done by non-surgeons, meaning that there may be less need of surgeons in the future. Another example is that the biotechnology is leading to new diagnostic test kits that may replace some types of expensive, automated equipment. To move slowly in acquiring imported automated diagnostic equipment or in establishing production lines for such equipment may benefit China in that technological advances in the next few years may result in sharply lower investment costs. Toward a Medical Technology Assessment Policy 20. The evaluation of the effectiveness, safety, and costs of new and traditional drugs and tezhniques for diagnosis, treatment, and prevention is assuming much greater importance because of the high costs of health services -7.6 - and of high technology. This is a truism throughout the world, yet few if any such studies have been done in China.!/ 21. Evaluation has always been a key factor in medical science and practice. Still, the twentieth century has seen a revolution in this field. Before 1900, few effective treatments were available. With the proliferation of treatment -both effective and ineffective -methods were needed to test the benefits and risks of interventions. 22. Generally speaking, effectiveness can only be established by well-controlled prospective studies. In most cases, interpretation of such studies (or trials) is difficult without a control group, since the natural history of disease is unpredictable. Selection of the control group is also an important issue, since it is often difficult to show that the treatment group and control group are in fact similar enough. Many studies using controls matched for a wide variety of characteristics have later been shown to have false results because the two groups were different (for example, if the control group is sicker than the experimental group, the treatment will look better whether it is or not). For this reason, the standard for testing effectiveness is the randomized controlled clinical trial, in which a group of patients are randomly assigned to either a study group or to a control group. Only this method assures comparability of the study group and the control group. The application of such studies is growing rapidly in the West. In China, controlled studies of drugs are often done, but such trials of other interventions appear to be rare.:/ 23. It is unwise to consider any medical intervention effective - whether preventive, diagnostic, therapeutic, or rehabilitative -until proof _/ A number of countries have developed national programs to assist health care policy-making through technology assessment. In Sweden, such a program was established at the highest governmental level in 1987. In the United States, a Congressionally-mandated program was established at the National Academy of Sciences in 1986. In the Netherlands, technology assessment has been stated to be the basis for all policy decisions concerning science and technology since 1984, and the Netherlands Health Council has developed an active program in health care technology assessment. Other countries, including France, Denmark, and Australia, have also begun to develop such national programs. 9/ In China, some traditional Chinese medicine (TCM) practitioners claim that they have a completely different theory that cannot be evaluated by statistical and experimental means. This statement is incorrect. It is equivalent to a surgeon saying that surgery is a personal technique and cannot be evaluated statistically. If any medical practitioner offers a service and claims a benefit, that possible benefit can be evaluated scientifically. The practitioner can define the proposed benefit and outcomes can be compared in treated and untreated patients. If the benefit is no more than placebo effect, the service should perhaps not be covered by public funds. -7.7 - is available. The history of Western med'cine, although marked with successes, is equally marked with failures in this regard. Failures usually have been health care innovations developed by a prestigious institution or investigator. These innovations are often promoted by industry for its own profit motives. Evaluation of the effects of the innovation comes only later, or not at all. Technologies that have been (or are) in widespread use in the West and now appear to be ineffective include: 1) a variety of operations for coronary artery disease, such as internal mammary artery ligation (coronary artery bypass graft, in use for ten years or so, is known to be effective only in some cases); 2) insulin and electroshock treatment for schizophrenia; 3) electronic fetal monitoring (not effective in relation to monitoring by stethoscope); 4) vectorcardiography (not effective relative to electrocar- diography); 5) gastric freezing for peptic ulcer disease; 6) oral drug treatment for diabetes; 7) a variety of diagnostic tests widely used in the 1960s and 1970s, such as sedimentation rate and C-reactive protein; and 8) several secondary preventive programs, such as screening all women for breast cancer by mammography (only shown to be effective for women over the age of 50 years). 24. Evaluating diagnostic procedures raises particular problems, since they do not themselves produce health. Therefore, the evaluation of diagnostic procedures has tended to focus on their precision: sensitivity, specificity, and predictive value. This field, too, is developing rapidly. 25. Safety of interventions is a factor that must always be considered. Therapeutic results may be relatively obvious; if a therapy does not benefit many people with a disease, it probably should not be used. Risks of an intervention are not so obvious. They may occur at much lower rates and require population studies to be done. Safety is difficult to assess for the same reasons that it is difficult to recognize risks. Long-term studies of large numbers of people are needed. Often, an intervention is put into use and its harmful effects only recognized after it has bco. used in thousands of people for some years. For example, x-ray examination of the pelvis of pregnant women was used for decades before epidemiological studies showed that it causes leukemia and other cancers in the offspring. 26. Some interventions have important social or psychological consequences that need to be assessed cr taken into account. For example, genetic screening of the fetus for Down's syndrome by amniocentesis during pregnancy, followed by abortion of affected cases, has been shown to be very cost-effective in Western countries. In China, however, parents have sometimes used amniocentesis to determine the sex of the child, and have aborted female children. This is certainly not cost-effective and demographic forecasts!/ have shown the future consequences and likely high social and economic costs of this action. Many Chinese physicians are reluctant to encourage the spread of this screening in these circumstances. !i In Zhejiang Province, for example, there are forecasted to be 346,000 males age 22 compared to only 267,900 females age 20 in the year 2000. -7.8 - 27. Financial costs are a critical factor of technology to assess in any widespread program. An intervention may be effective, but it may be very expensive. For example, renal dialysis is an effective and lifesaving therapy for those with end-stage renal disease. The fee for one treatment is about Rmb. 300, and since treatment must be given at least twice a week, the cost of one patient is more than Rmb. 30,000 a year. Choices must be made within limited funds available for health expenditure. Z/ 28. Financial costs can be measured or estimated. Knowing only how much something costs, however, may not be useful. China must also ask, what are other possible uses of the money? The amount of money required to treat one patient for end-stage renal disease could treat many patients effectively to avoid or manage the risk factors of severe hypertension, smoking or the development of diabetes -three of the main causes of renal disease. Or, if other methods of treatment of renal disease are available that cost Rmb. 200 a year, should dialysis be used? Another way to look at the issue is - childhood immunization prevents infectious disease at a very low cost; should not all children be immunized before dialysis is used? Economists have developed techniques to answer the question of relative value of interventions. The standard technique is cost/effectiveness analysis, in which costs are measured in financial terms and effectiveness is measured in outcome terms, such as years of life gained or quality-adjusted life years (QALYs). Using these techniques, different interventions can be ,iirectly compared. For example, one approach has estimated that a physician's advice to stop smoking has a cost-effectiveness of UK pounds 180/QALY, while coronary artery bypass graft, to treat the most common medical complication of smoking, has a cost-effectiveness of UK pounds 1080/QALY. Additional sample cost-effectiveness values are shown in Table 7.3 included with Attachment 1 at the end of this annex chapter. China's economists and medical schools have little experience in such technology assessment approaches thus far. In view of the findings of the earlier sections of this report, tnis would appear to be a very high priority subject area for development and research. 29. A process of evaluating an intervention by these methods has come to be called technologv assessment. Technology assessment is any method which increases understanding of the consequences of technological choices.!/ &/ A number of secondary screening programs that are gaining popularity in China appear not to be cost-effective, including screening for stomach cancer and lung cancer (see Box 7.2 in the Main Report on lung cancer screening). !/ A key method of technology assessment not mentioned above is synthesis. In a process of synthesis, available knowledge is summarized. leading to conclusions and recommendations. Thus, it is not necessary for a country such as China to study each intervention by prospective clinical trials. Western data can be obtained and synthesized with available Chinese data. -7.9 - A Medical Technology Assessment Program for China 30. As outlined above, China has a variety of problems managing medical technology. The problems range from an emphasis on local production, with concomitant quality problems, to inappropriate pricing policies. Government or insurance-based programs to deal with the problems are hampered by a lack of information on the risks, benefits, costs, and other implications of any technology, new or old. Technology assessment is the process of developing such information. Assembling and considering evidence on the implications of technology is an important part of assuring appropriate use of technology in the health care system. At the same time, such evidence is often not collected or is ignored by decision-makers. The result in many countries, including China, is that technologies: * are often accepted for general use without evaluation; * are often accepted for use before evaluation is completed, making it difficult to act on subsequent results; * are often over-supplied relative to reasonable estimates of the health needs of the population; e that have been evaluated are often used for conditions beyond those that have been covered in the evaluation; * that have been evaluated and accepted are often used at frequen- cies well beyond those known to be efficacious and necessary; and a even those that avoid the above characteristics may be cost-inef- fective, in that an equally effective and lower-cost technology exists but is not utilized. 31. China can easily and quickly learn about the assessment of technologies by drawing on rich experiences in other countries. Still two important questions remain: (1) How is the evidence on technology to be assembled, synthesized, and disseminated so that appropriate policies on technology can be developed and applied? (2) To what extent does the current system of organizing and financing health care in China help or hinder these processes? 32. The second question has been alluded to in various parts of this report. The present system in China does not include incentives for either appropriate adoption or utilization of technology. Almost all aspects of the present system reinforce tendencies toward technological expansion. The public, the health care providers, the policy makers, the manufacturers, and administrators all see such expansion as being desirable. Only a few voices caution about problems of excessive use of some high technology devices or about growing problems of maldistribution and poor placement of technological services. Policy options (dealt with elsewhere in this report) to reverse -7.10 - these trends and begin to constrain costs are complex and multifaceted and their implementation will take experimentation and time. While this is underway, China needs to address itself to answering the first question. As one way to do this, it is recommended that China develop a national Drogram for medical technology assessment. 33. Information on medical technology has the characteristic of being useful for different decisions, but it does not often yield financial profits to the user. The cost of producing new information may be high, while the costs of dissemination are low. This means that most national and regional efforts at technology assessment have to be publicly funded, so that all may share the costs and all may share the benefits of the information. 34. An organizational focal point is needed to carry out such a function. While this unit would not have to carr- out all assessment, it would have the important tasks of stating national priorities, coordinating efforts of different parties, and communicating results between different parties. 35. A high-level government body is likely to be needed, made up of representatives of different important interests (and sources of funding). This solution has been followed in Sweden in the development of its program and has been proposed for Canada. In the United States, with its highly pluralistic economy and health system, the major national program includes representatives of both public and private bodies. 36. One possibility would be to develop a National Medical Tec1nology Assessment Council (NMTAC). This agency would identify new and emerging technologies, select important technologies for careful assessment, fund certain clinical and economic evaluation, provide a liaison with international efforts in this field, disseminate results, and act as a general clearing house. The full membership of such a Council cannot be specified, but obvious members include the Ministry of Public Health (MOPH), the State Pharmaceutical Administration (SPAC), and the People's Liberation Army (PLA). Knowledgeable medical specialists and research experts would also be needed. Because provincial governments would be among the major consumers of the information, their membership on such a council is probably appropriate. 37. The NMTAC would need both money and staff. Much of the work could be done in research centers, such as major universities. However, academic researchers often have a poor understanding of the needs of policy makers. A core (permanent, technical/economic) staff is important to give direction to the researchers and interpret the assessment results. 38. One important, early role for the Council would be to stimulate the collection of data on technology in use in China. Information on the extent of adoption and use of key technologies is sadly lacking. A registry or periodic national surveys could provide valuable information. On the other hand, the Council would probably not have to fund much original biological or epidemiological data collection. Instead, it may be able to rely on available research about efficacy and effectiveness, including clinical trials, especially those developed in such countries as the United States, Sweden, and -7.11 - the Netherlands. International contacts are an important way to assure efficient programs. 39. A second responisibility of the NMTAC would be the identification of new and emerging technologies; an important part of this would be to select important technologies for evaluation before they were diffused. Health researchers in the Council could maintain contacts with major research agencies in China, as well as internatio-.al groups, to gather necessary information. Industry could also furnish information to the Council, through the SPAC. 40. A third substantive task of the NMTAC and its staff would be synthesis of available information. Synthesis means analyzing and summarizing available information, and often results in guidelines or recommendations. It should be followed by dissemination of information, i.e. making certain that key decision-makers have access to it. Effective methods of synthesis and dissemination would also have to be developed by the NMTAC. A method of both synthesizing and dissemination information developed in the United States and now used in about 10 countries is the consensus conference.!/ A consensus conference involves a specially chosen group of experts who receive a synthesis report in advance, have a conference discussion, debate a set of conclusions, and publish and disseminate the results. Since consensus conferences include key physicians whose opinions often can affect the attitudes and behavior of doctors throughout the health system, consensus exercises are usually national to promote wide discussion. 41. Lastly, linking education to technology assessment is important. All higher-level medical students should be taught the essentials of technology assessment, and continuing education for physicians should include an introduction to principles of technology assessment. The NMTAC could ensure use of appropriate course materials and serve as the national resource center for such information. 9 Consensus conferences are not necessarily organized by government. In the Netherlands, an organization of medical specialists sponsors national consensus conferences. In the United States, medical groups have also taken a leading role in consensus and synthesis exercises. Attachment 1 to Annex Chapter 7 -7.12 - Medical Technologies in China History, Policies, Current Situation Details 1.

Western medicine was introduced into China during the 1700s. The first Western hospitals were built in China during the 1800s and were run by missionaries. The first school for Western medicine in China was the Peking Union Medical College, started with the help of Johns Hopkins School of Medicine and with financial support from the Rockefeller Foundation. Prominent Chinese statesmen were trained in Western medicine and they had an important impact upon the course of the nationalist movement in the early 20th century.!/ This type of contact with Western medicine was broken after Liberation in 1949. Thereafter, international trade and contacts, including medical contacts, were mainly with the USSR and countries such as Czechoslovakia, Hungary, and East Germany. Building designs, hospital practices and organization, and health planning approaches were heavily influenced by this period. 3. Trade with Japan increased beginning in 1956, and after the break in relations with the USSR in 1961 there were gradual openings to Western European countries. As the Cultural Revolution (1966-1976) wound down, there I/ Perhaps the most well-known of these was Dr. Sun Yat Sen. Attachment 1 to Annex Chapter 7 -7.13 - was increased trade and contacts with Western countries and a part of this was for medical equipment imports.!/ 4. Exchanges between Chinese and foreign medical institutions and profes- sionals also became more frequent. Joint ventures in the medical area developed rapidly. Such companies as Squibb, Smith, Kline and French, and Johnson and Johnson developed pharmaceutical joint ventures. For medical equipment, China imported assembly lines for B-type ultrasound and blood chemistry equipment. 5. These developments have brought many' changes to medical thinking in China. In particular, the awareness and knowledge of modern medical techno- logy has increased dramatically during this period. Chinese physicians and planners have sought to learn about Western technology and to acquire it, feeling that they were markedly behind the West and had to make up for lost time./ The Production and Distribution of Pharmaceuticals 6. Under the SPAC, there were 1452 manufacturers in 1987 producing drugs as follows: 889 -chemical (Western drug) firms; 534 -traditional drugs; and 29 -traditional herbs. 7. China is essentially self-sufficient in drugs, importing only about 100 difficult-to-manufacture drugs such as cancer chemotherapy. Total drug imports in 1987 were valued at about US$150 million (Western drugs) and about US$30 million (Chinese traditional drugs). Western manufacturers are actively trying to develop markets in China. Exports totaled about US$400 million in Western drugs and US$200 million in Chinese traditional drugs in 1987. The value of Chinese drug production over time is shown below. 8. Drugs are distributed mainly through hospitals, clinics and doctors (90 percent), and sold through drug stores. Most drugs can be bought without a prescription. In theory, a prescription by a higher level (hospital) doctor is required for narcotics and psychotropic drugs; however, in some rural settings these drugs may be dispensed directly by personnel such as rural doctors. (Major tranquilizers are also often used at this level.) Anes- thetic drugs and radiopharmaceuticals are made in special factories and are distributed through special channels only to hospitals. Blood products and 9/ U.S. exports of medical equipment to China rose from US$413 thousand in 1978 to US$45.9 million in 1986. (U.S. Department of Commerce Data.) %' The growth in technology investments in medical equipment may be il- lustrated by the experience of the Second Hospital of Zhejiang Medical University. The annual expenditures in the hospital for equipment were around Rmb. 10-20,000 during the period 1959 to 1974, rose to Rmb. 118,200 in 1975, Rmb. 1,044,500 in 1976, and have averaged about Rmb. 500,000 per year since 1976.

Family planning drugs are produced in a special factory under state control and are available only from some hospitals, family planning clinics and some MCH practitioners. 9. Drugs dispensed by hospital and clinics are sold at the regulated price to insured and uninsured. Insured persons may also buy prescribed medicines in a drug store and be reimbursed by insurance. Drugs dispensed by rural doctors or other fee-earning practitioners are sold at the regulated price with profits accruing to the doctor. Present Policies Toward Drug Technology 10. Quality assurance policies are important to guarantee quality of care and avoid harm to patients. Most countries regulate the safety and effective- ness of drugs, and Western countries generally regulate drugs quite rigorous- ly. 11. The manufacturing and regulation of the quality of drugs is based on international standards stated in standard pharmacopeias. Both the SPAC and the MOPH play important roles in the quality regulation process (described below) under the 1984 Pharmaceutical Law. After passage of the law, small manufacturing units were merged, and some were closed largely because of inability to meet quality standards. The number of manufacturers fell from about 1900 to 1452. 12. The Ministry of Public Health has overall regulatory responsibility but delegates portions of its duties to provincial drug institutes under the Provincial Health Bureaus to inspect drug-related matters in hospitals, factories, and drug stores and to carry out tests of drugs. 13. The process of approval of new drugs by the MOPH is lengthy and fairly strict. Drugs are divided into 5 classes: 1. new drug in the world -not in any Pharmacopeia; 2. used in other countries, but not in their Pharmacopeia; 3. compound drugs -not used together before; Attachment 1 to Annex Chapter 7 -7.15 - 4. new drug in China, but in other countries' Pharmacopeia; 5. known drug, but with a changed method of administration. a. The process is rigor-us for the first three classes with the MOPH units taking the lead in coordinating testing and with only the MCOH issuing approval; however, testing can be done at the provincial level. Requirements are particularly high for the first class, of which there have been about 10 types since 1984. Testing procedures include: chemical tests, to confirm that the drug is what it should be; qualitative and quantitative analysis to measure the contents (including purity); pharmacology, including phar- macokinetics and pharmacodynamics (absorption, distribution, elimination) -this requires animal tests; and toxicology - including acute toxicity and chronic toxicity in 2 kinds of pure species animals, usually dogs and rats, at 2 or 3 dose levels, given for 4 times longer than clinical treatment. There are also tests for carcinogenesis and DNA tests. Psychotropic drugs have dependency tests. There are also tests for irritation of skin and allergy. b. For the fourth and fifth class of drugs, the provincial drug in- stitute has the normal responsibility for assuring safety and effectiveness. The criteria used is contained in the Chinese Pharmacopeia, which is similar to that of Britain, but with detailed standards slightly lower than those of Britain. c. For drugs new to the Chinese market in any class, testing is only *done at the provincial level or in one of the 30 clinical pharma- cology institutes under the MOPH. A typical sequence and approach to testing would be as follows. A prototype drug may have been produced in a research institute; before wider scale production, it is tested. If it appears satisfactory, a drug factory will be asked to produce the drug, and it is then tested again. At that point, the information is submitted to a drug review committee which calls on experts for advice on standards. The Ministry or Institute then decides, based on advice from the committee, where and how the drug must be tested in humans. Ordinarily, testing would involve at least 300 cases in a hospital or clinic, plus a control group, which means that multiple institutions are usually involved. The committee specifies the process of testing, which is designed to find adverse effects and indications for use, Tests are usually single blind. Some are double blind in design, but randomization is apparently not used. The size of the study group is designed to assure a sample large enough for statistical analysis and can involve as many as 2000 patients. After testing, the drug is assessed by the MOPH or the provincial health bureau and a decision is made. If the testing is at the provincial level in one province, it generally is accepted by other provinces. d. -For drugs which have been approved for use, the institutes carry out testing cif samples and also use spot checks. Samples are Attachment 1 to Annex Chagter 7 -7.16 - obtained of new drugs just entering the market, drugs new to a particularly factory, and of drugs where the factory itself feels that there is a problem. Except in the last case, 95 percent or more of drugs meet the standards. Spot checks of hospitals, factories, and companies selling drugs are also carried out and samples are obtained for testing. If drugs do not meet the standards, staff of the institute visit the factory to discover why and work with factory management to ensure remedial action is taken. e. For the monitoring of adverse reactions, activity is limited. The MOPH monitors hepatitis drugs, antibiotics, and drugs produced from the new biotechnology (such as ir.terferon) in a few selected hospitals. The MOPH also monitors and controls use of three types of drugs: narcotics, psychotropics, and radiopharmaceuticals. 14. The SPAC operates a two tier quality control system. Each factory has a quality control division and an inspector on each line. Officials of the SPAC say that this is a very serious program that has improved quality greatly since 1984. The Pharmaceutical Industry Quality Monitoring and Inspection Center -part of the SPAC -takes samples of old and new drugs for chemical and pharmaceutical testing. 15. Good Manufacturing Practices (GMP) are just starting to be applied in Chinese industry. The MOPH and SPAC have standards based on the WHO guide- lines. MOPH standards are not as high as (for example) those of the U.S. Food and Drug Administration, but they are higher than those of the SPAC, which leads to difficulties. They are being applied mostly to new factories, since old factories are not able to meet the standards. In theory, this system also applies to TCM drugs, which are the furthest from meeting the standards. However, the active ingredient is usually not known in most TCM drugs, which leads to arguments about what the tests mean. 16. The size of workload and scarcity of resources with which the drug quality institutes generally have to work is illustrated by the case of the Drug Control Institute of Shaanxi Province. It has an annual budget of Rmb. 290,000 and has 100 staff members. The institute oversees 76 factories in the province: 13 making traditional medicine, 3 making biological products from body organs, one making biological products from blood, and 59 making chemical products. In addition, 302 hospitals in the province make drugs (mainly intravenous fluids) for their own use. In total, these factories or manufacturers make 4.7 different drugs, 305 of which are chemical drugs and 114 of which are traditional medicine drugs. The Institute also oversees 1700 companies selling drugs and 1600 drug stores and 103 county drug institutes that do spot inspection and sample testing. These county institutes have poor labs, however. In contrast, the factories tend to have more sophisticated testing equipment and better-trained people. The institute's dedication to its task is limited by inadequate training of its staff, inadequate (or insufficient) equipment, and very inadequate numbers of animals for testing. Toxicology is particularly weak both here and in China as a whole. The most pressing problem is that only acute toxicity can be measured. Animals are not Attachment 1 to Annex Chanter 7 -7.17 - easily available, and space for animals is lacking. Both MOPH institutes and provincial institutes have this problem. 17. To further strengthen drug quality control, the MOPH plans to a'pgrade provincial instit'ites, with investments of Rmb. 400,000 each, to be matched by a similar amount from each provincial government. With World Bank support, the MOPH has developed 2 national training centers to upgrade staff in the drug control institutes. Present Policies Toward Medical EguiRment 18. The number of factories under the National Medical Instrument Corpora- tion producing medical equipment and materials has risen from 24u in 1978 to 373 in 1987 (313 for equipment, 56 for materials, and four for others). Product value in 1987 was Rmb. 1.4 billion, Rmb. 1.0 billion in equipment and Rmb. 0.34 billion in material. Products are in nine categories, and include 2100 items (and 9000 models). There were about 20 million pieces of surgical apparatus produced in 1987 and about 9,000 x-ray machines (up from 6,000 in 1984). 19. From 1981-1986, the SPAC estimates that China imported US$880 million in medical equipment, 70% of the Chinese product value. (Sources in the Ministry of Public Health estimate 1987 imports at Rmb. 230 million).!/ Physicians and hospital administrators are eager to acquire new equipment from outside China.!/ 20. Although the availability of equipment for diagnosis is sometimes surprisingly good, much of it is quite old and a considerable amount of it is out of service, primarily because of lack of spare parts (for both domestic and imported mac'iines). The wide variety of equipment in China raises particular prob'ems of servicing, spare parts, and calibration. A typical large hospi-a] may have equipment from a number of countries, requiring fluency in different languages and raising difficulties of stockpiling spare parts. In general, routine maintenance is handled quite well, but lack of 9/ Exports were US$300 million in the samt: years -600 items, mostly needles for Chinese traditional medicina, small x-ray machines, electronic medical equipment, and health materials. In general, hospital staff seem to prefer to buy Japanese equipment because it is cheaper than other imports (in part because of a lower transportation costs). The cost of training in Japan is also less; and the Japanese manufacturers visit hospitals and organize special exhibi- tions. Better service and spare parts are also a factor. Hitachi has an office in Shanghai, for example, with spare parts and an engineer. GE has an office, but it has no engineer, and no spare parts, which must come from either Hong Kong or the U.S. The European and American manufacturers are reported to give relatively poor service in general, although there are exceptions. Attachment 1 to Annex Chaoter 7 -7.18 - access to the specialized skills of engineers and physicists makes more sophisticated maintenance difficult and variable in quality.!/ 21. Ouality. Medical devices are generally not regulated for quality in China. There is a national organization to set standards for all equipment, but it has done limited work in the health area. The SPAC has a medical equipment standard, but it is not a published state standard against which manufacturers can be inspected. Each manufacturer must have a quality control division and each worker is considered responsible for quality. There are also state and provi,,cial inspection stations, but this is not a complete system for quality control of devices and equipment. Partly as a result of this situation domestically-produced medical equipment has quality problems. Anecdotal reports from doctors and hospitals indicate that Chinese-made equipment is considered satisfactory if the technology is not complex. Bu. in more complex areas reports and opinions of practitioners indicate that domestically produced items are of poor quality. Some examples include: -X-ray machines above 500 ma are said to provide very poor image resolution, are often out of service, and suffer from poor service provided by the manufacturers. Machines under 200 ma are reported to leak excessive radiation. -Gastroscopes are too thick and their fibers break easily. Even new units show spots in the image because of broken fibers. Dental chairs operate on an oil pressure hydraulic system that is often out of order. One consequence is that chairs may fall unexpectedly. -Automatic biochemical analyzers are reported to give unreliable results. -Centrifuges are reported to break if operated at speed high enough to reliably perform tests. -Specialized microscopes, such as dark field microscopes, have poor image quality; some regular laboratory microscopes suffer from excessively rapid wear of the focussing mechanism. -Ambulances are built on the base frame of an ordinary truck, whose suspension makes for too rough a ride. In addition, they are often too short to accommodate a recumbent patient, not tall enough inside, have poor insulation against outside pollution and dust, have only two-wheel drive and poor mechanical reliability, and have no air conditioning. Most importantly, they are often not supplied with a suitable package of emergency equipment and materials. Some provinces, cities and medical universities have established specialized repair units and these have eased some of the problems. A,ttachment 1 to Aln_ex ChaRter 7 -7.19 - CT scanners are produced on an experimental basis in China, but the image is so poor and they have so much \"down-time\" that only two have gone into use.!/ The Chinese linear accelerator is low voltage and has excessive down-time. These problems are partially offset by the ease of obtaining service and spare parts compared to foreign made machines. The Chinese gamma camera for radionuclide studies has good resolution, but has a small crystal diameter, which limits its application. In addition, the computer software is not entirely satisfactory. 22. The quality problem is acknowledged by officials of the SPAC. They are quite concerned about this problem, and wish to improve training, components, and materials. Quality is a problem in part because of low profits for the industry. SPAC has asked the factories to give a guarantee for quality, including replacement and service, but few have responded. Improvements in quality in the last two years have been made and a major factor stimulating this is thought to be competition beginning since economic reform. 23. Shortages also continue to be important. X-ray film shortages are par- ticularly important especially given the prevalence of fluoroscopy (see below). Reagents for diagnostic equipment are another important shortage, ineluding reagent materials for dry chemistry tests made in China. 24. Utilization and Levels. Appropriate utilization of technology depends on its location at an appropriate level and on a referral network to charnnel patients. For example, coronary intensive care is developing in China and cardiac monitoring and resuscitation equipment is found rather frequently. In most cases, this capability is underutilized and this indicates a lack of planning for appropriate location of such equipment and an effective referral system to rapidly channel appropriate patients to it. Some hospitals appear to be de-eloping coronary care capability based on their own interests but without good prospects of being able to use it effectively. The diffusion of such modern technology into China in an unplanned manner is a serious concern, considering the cost implications and limited resources. Chronic renal dialysis is another example of an expensive technology in the early phase of diffusion with questionable justificatio.i in many regions. 25. Maintenance. Most large hospitals have a medical equipment department that supervises procurement and carries out routine maintenance and repair. The experience of the Second Hospital of Zhejiang Medical University I/ A Chinese made CT head scanner in Shanghai carried out only 900 seans in 1985, while the Japanese head scanners in the same city averaged more than 3,700 scans each. (Hsiao and Tsai, 1986).

A survey of equipment in the Hospital showed 64 percent in good working order, 20 percent with flaws such as calibration problems but usable, and 16 percent completely unsatisfactory. Anecdotal reports throughout China indicate that it is uncommon for a hospital to take equipment out of service as long as it can be operated. Equipment is generally seen as an asset that must be used until it will no longer work. Equipment is often out of service because of lack of spare parts and spe- cialized repair. Especially in the case of old equipment, the hospital must just wait for the company to respond to a call. In some cases, spare parts are just not available. 26. Equipment Import Policies. The government policy toward domestic production implies that only those things that cannot be made in China will be imported. In practice, this principle is administered (or coordinated) by the State Economic Commission. Imported equipment is given a priority if the need for eouipment cannot be met domestically either because national equipment is of poor quality or because of a serious shortage. The major constraint on imports is the difficulty of obtaining access to foreign currency. Foreign currency is controlled by the planning commission of the appropriate level of government. In addition, a number of types of medical equipment are subject to administrative control of imports by the State Economic Commission and by provincial government agencies which must approve import licenses for prospective purchases. Controlled items include endoscopes, x-ray machines, ultrasound, electron microscopes, laboratory equipment, and so forth. In practice, larger and more specialized hospitals can often justify the import Attachment 1 to Annex Chapter 7 -7.21 - because they can ask for specifications that are not available in Chinese-made equipment. Smaller hospitals must usually buy the national product. 27. The Planning and Finance Department of the MOPH has the responsibility to review applications for and control three types of imported medical equipment -CT scanners, magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) devices, and lithotrypters. In addition the overall number of these same items must fall within the limits approved by the State Economic Commission. 28. This MOPH Department also administers the approval and financing for procurement of imported medical equipment for the 13 key medical univer- sities, veiious institutes and more than 40 hospitals it operates. Concur- rence from the State Economic Commission is required for import of items costing above US$20,000. 29. Provincial government planning commissions control access to foreign exchange for imports. In general, provinces can import equipment freely if they authorize foreign exchange for it from their own holdings. Provincial planning commissions have the responsibility, in principle, of planning for medical equipment, including imported eqdipment, as part of planning new hospitals. However, in practice, little attention is paid to medical equipment in the general planning process except in the case of specialized hospitals. This raises the risk of imbalances in equipment provision at different levels and in different regions and has helped to foster an inefficient and expensive proliferation of specialized hospitals. Regulation of Technolo2y 30. This kind of approach will require some time however and there are many specific problems to be dealt with. Overall, regulation of technology remains at an early stage in China. Perhaps the ubiquitous x-ray technology provides the best insights into some of the issues surrounding technology regulation. Eventually China may wish to apply cost-effectiveness measures as part of its policies for regulation of medical technology. Indicative cost-effectiveness ratings of some medical procedures are given in Table 7.3 below. 31. X-ray Services. There have beeui no systematic studies of the quality of x-rays in China. In ger,eral, the quality of film images is adequate as is the newer x-ray equipment. However, much old equipment is still in widespread use. There is little attention paid to the risks of radiation exposure from x-rays. Technicians or physicians working with x-rays do not routinely wear film badges or other monitoring devices. Shielding of machines is inade- quate. Appropriate gloves and aprons are not available. Patients are not appropriately shielded. 32. Fluoroscopy and other radiology practices that result in excessive radiation exposure are still widespread. An estimated 160 million people have an x-ray examination each year. About 70 percent of the examinations are by fluoroscopy. Most hospitals use fluoroscopy at least half the time and only A&tacet 1 to Annex ChaDter 7 -7.22 - T-ble 7. 3 Approximate Cost-Effectiveness Ratings for Selected Medical Procedures Cost per QALY Gained (1000 British pounds) Pacemakers for heart block 0.67 Hip teplacement 0.75 Valve replacement for aortic stenosas 0.95 CABG for severe angina vlth left main coronary artery disease 1.04 Kidney transplantation (cadaver) 3.00 Heart transplantation 5.11 CABG for severe angLna vith single vessel disease 11.40 HemodialysLs in hospital 14.00 QALY -Quality-Adjusted Life Year Source: Williams A.

This is both inaccurate and dangero- us. In some smaller hospitals, only fluoroscopes are available and personnel have only been trained to do fluoroscopy. In general, fluoroscopy is an outmoded technology and should be gradually abandoned. The positive rates of examinations in smaller institutions, which may do nothing but fluoroscopy, are quite low, indicating that many unnecessary fluoroscopies are done. The most important reasons for its continued use are financial -lack of invest- ment funds to purchase new equipment; lack of recurrent budgets to purchase x- ray films; greater financial returns to use of fluoroscopy because of its lower recurrent costs. 33. There are an estimated 100,000 x-ray units in China. There are 11,000 hospitals above the county level, most with several larger x-ray units. However, the 45,000 township hospitals and neighborhood clinics mostly have 35-50 ma x-ray machines. There is a national regulatory program for radiological equipment and services conducted by the MOPH.!! Before 1980, there was very poor protection from radiation, especially for physicians and technicians. X-ray equipment emitted excess radiation, and the prevalence of !i Another program for the testing of devices is that of the People's Liberation Army (PIA), which has a Drug and Medical Instrument Quality Control Institute located in Beijing with 130 staff, largely engineers and pharmacologists. The Institute tests the quality of all drugs and devices imported by the PLA. There are also some non-governmental attempts to deal with the issue of quality of medical equipment. In Shanghai, for example, the Biomedical Engineering Committee, a voluntary organization, is beginning to attempt to examine quality. But so far, no collection of data has been carried out. Attachment 1 to Annex Chapter 7 -7.23 - fluoroscopy exposed operators to a great deal of radiation (and still does). This problem was recognized beginning in 1972, and a standard was developed by the MOPH and published in 1978. Rcvised standards were issued in October 1987 and June 1988. The latest standard uses international protection measures as its basis.!, 34. The radiation protection program is run by the MOPH staff; the Radiation Medicine Research Institution in the Academy of Medical Sciences, and provincial Radiation Health Protection Institutes (the name varies in some provinces). The Ministry also has inspectors in parts of China where there are major manufacturers. The total number of persons involved is about 150. 35. The program has two principles. First, old x-ray machines cannot be rapidly replaced, so priority is placed on protecting doctors, technicians and patients. The regulation defines protection for the operators %/ -lead aprons, gloves, and special shielding. Extra testing of radiation levels from older equipment is done and doctors have been asked to use radiation dose badges or dosemeters since 1985 (few comply, citing lack of materials). Although some institutions lack the protective items required by the regula- tion, the MOPH has the impression that doctors' reluctance to use protection is the greater problem, particularly in the township hospital and below, where the staff has weaker medical knowledge. This may indeed be a major problem as diffusion of radiology has been very rapid, and x-ray equipment has been installed with little technical training,2/ and certainly without training in radiation protection. 36. Secondly, new x-ray machines are required to meet the new quality standards. The provincial or municipal level institutes examine the new product, based on sampling of three percent of a production line. If the machines fail, there is a second sampling of six percent. If the standards still are not met, that production batch cannot be sold. (There is no examination cf the production system or assembly line.) Since 1982, x-ray machines above 200 ma meet the standards. Compliance of smaller dosage x-ray machines is still quite poor. At first this regulatory program had difficul- ties because of resistance of the manufacturers. Now the SPAC strongly i.e., the operator should get no more than five roentgens an hour under the new standard. The standard was previously six ro3ntgens an hour. / The draft regulation also deals with patient protection. Patients should be appropriately shielded with lead, with priority attention being paid to pregnant women. Hospitals are generally being pushed by the MOPH to improve their radiation control practices. D/ The MOPH is now beginning to train operators. Two-week courses are planned, beginning at the county level and above. The courses for below-county level will include both radiation protection and diagnostic use of x-rays. Those who cannot pass such a course will no longer be permitted to practice. Attachment 1 to Annex Chapter 7 -7.24 - supports the program as a method of increasing quality of this equipment and manufacturers are more cooperative. 37. Up to now the MOPH has mainly used equipment standards for the purpose of encouraging the acquisition of modern technology, since many hospitals have lacked even basic capacity. At the same time, the standards do define a level that perhaps should not generally be surpassed, so might be said to be restrictive in some. As described in Annex D-1, a number of pieces of equip- ment listed in the MOPH standard are of questionable benefit, such as vectorcardiographs. In general, large hospitals now are adequately equipped. Middle sized hospitals remain provided with rather poor medical equipment. Past approaches to standards were not based on epidemiological data or cost-effectiveness considerations. No distinction was made between equipment produced domestically and imported equipment. There is a clear need to update and revise the standards. 38. The MOPH has attempted to address some of the problems of acquisition by developing a draft Medical Equipment Management Standard based on modern management practice. It is intended to apply to soplhisticated and expensive equipment, meaning equipment usually costing more than Rmb. 10,000. The regulation deals with 1) planning, 2) organization, 3) staffing, 4) control, and 5) leadership. It stresses that medical equipment management is a multi-disciplinary task and that four types of people should be involved at the hospital level: 1) scientific and technical staff, including engineers; 2) health staff; 3) health economics experts; and 4) management staff. Three stages in equipment management are recognized: 1) Before procurement -planning and feasibility considerations. The hospital should look at such questions as appropriateness, necessity for import, accessibility of money, and the projected rate of utilization. 2) Procurement -this stage usually gets most of the attention. 3) After procurement -maintenance, service, and final discard. The standard proposes that two-five percent of the equipment budget be set aside for maintenance and service. The standards do not deal with disposing of old equipment, since institutions see equipment as an asset that can be used as long as it can be operated. Therefore, the regulations only deal with giving equipment to a lower-level institution. 39. When the regulation is promulgated, 29 technologies will be controlled, 23 of these by the State Commission on Science and Technology, including electroni microscopes, NMR, DNA analyzer, fluorocytometer, mass and gas chromatographs, and computers costing more than Rmb. 1 million. The MOPH already controls CT and MRI, and proposes to develop controls for emission computed tomography (ECT), digital substraction angiography (DSA), linear accelerators, and The standard apply from 1988 to all \"MOPH- owned\" hospitals and to hospitals that get support for equipment from MOPH or public health bureaus. Eventually, the standard should apply to all Attachment 1 to Annex Chapter 7 -7.25 - hospitals. At the moment, smaller hosp'.tals are not capable of meeting the standards. The standards also require each provincial bureau of public hualth to set up an equipment division. The Ipurpose o\u00a3 this requirement is to encourage bureaus of public health to develop expertise in the area of medical equipment. Ancillary Technology Services and SRecial ToRics for Attention 40. The following topics deserve further investigation and study as China develops its health system tecbnology. These areas clearly require new investment and new technologies but caution must be exercised to control the costs of these items to levels which China can afford while enabling it to avoid becoming dependent on imported equipment and materials. 41. Blood bank facilities are often technologically adequate and staff are well-trained. The capacity is severely limited, however, and diffusion of blood banks to medium and smaller cities has yet to occur. The supply of blood is small in the largest cities, and blood products are even more limited. 42. Emergency services in the best hospitals are outstanding, but otherwise the emergency care system is inadequate in all respects. Ambulance services are inadequate and poorly organized, attendants are not well-trained and com- munities are not taught to deal with emergencies. 43. Psychiatric Services are grossly inadequate in terms of the number of staff and beds. The quality of available services is generally poor, except that standard drugs are widely available. Out-patient clinics and treatment approaches are very few. Outmoded treatments, such as insulin shock therapy and electroconvulsive (or electroshock) treatment for schizophren.a, are in widespread use, even in the largest institutions. 44. Rehabilitation Services are inadequate in all respects. Services cannot begin to meet needs. Few facilities are available. Technology is primitive and difficult to acquire. Modern rehabilitation needs to be integrated with clinical services, and involves such actions as early ambulation for patients and education in how to deal with functional deficits. Little of such activities is seen in the ordinary hospitals in China. 45. Dentistry Services are quite adequate at the highest levels but severely lacking and very inadequate in quality at the community level. Dentists and other dental manpower are in short supply. The ordinary hospital service fills cavities (caries) and gives symptomatic treatment for gum diseasi. Children and adults are not generally systematically instructed in tooth and gum care. Fluoride is not often used topically. Conversely, the consequences of severe fluorosis in many areas of China cannot be dealt with adequately. 46. Laboratory Services are generally inadequate in equipment and personnel, except at the highest level hospitals. There is a severe shortage of trained staff. In such circumstances, automated equipment can still produce reliable results, but such equipment is generally in short supply in China. Sample AttA4 lent 1 to A Lax 7 _ -7.26 - testing to check quality of laboratory results is only done with the largest hospitals. The anomalous situation which has developed is that physicians do not trust lab results and hence order wider varieties and more repetitions of tests than is desirable. Even so, they may over-prescribe for non-diagnosed problems in the event the lab missed something. Partly as a result, and as a result of poor lab scheduling, short hours and the absence of pre-admission diagnostic procedures, patients remain in hospitals longer than necessary. Standard for Hospital Medical Eguipment 47. \"The General Hospital Standard for Medical Equipment (on Trial)\" was issued by Ministry of Public Health of P.R.C. in October 1986. Under the mandate of the Medical Administration Department of MOPH, the \"Standard\" was drafted by a special research group. It was composed of experts of different disciplines, technologists, nurses and hospital administrators. No epidemiological data was used and no cost-effectiveness was calculated in making the \"Standard\"; it was formulated on the basis of experience of the members of the group. In addition, different sized hospitals in some provinces and cities had been asked for their opinions about the preliminary draft of the \"Standard. n 48. The equipment and quantities shown in the \"Standard\" are considered the minimum for fulfilling the tasks of medical care which hospitals of different sizes are nominally accountable for. The purpose of the \"Standard\" is to push those hospitals which have not yet come up to the minimum standard for medical equipment to improve their equipment capacity. 49. Currently, because of the differences in the economic and technological strengths in different parts of China, the \"Standard\" is used for reference only. 50. According to the \"Standard,\" the number of main sophisticated medical equipments are as shown in Table 7.4. 51. The level of technology implicit in this standard would make many hospitals in developed nations feel under-equipped. While there is no doubt that China needs some higher level hospitals with the range of equipment shown in the standard, it would clearly be inappropriate for most hospitals, even most high-level hospitals, to aspire to these standards. Such an approach would be enormously costly, not only investment terms but also in subsequent operating cost terms. 52. China faces a difficult dilemma -how to equip hospitals to give cost effective, humane care to those who can benefit from it. It raises questions on how to ensure truly workable referral systems so that those who can benefit from the higher technologies can readily gain access. It also raises questions on how to constrain the understandable demand from physicians to have access to the best technology to treat their patients. Matters of institutional pride and prestige are also at stake. Lastly, it raises very difficult questions on how to appropriately ration access of patients to Attachment 1 to Annex Chaoter 7 -7.27 - facilities which have such technology -by ability to pay, by potential medical benefit, by national affordability, etc. 53. While answers to the dilemma are difficult and may take many years of research and experimentation of formulate, it is clear that continuation of plans to build ever larger numbers of hospitals and beds, and to equip them to anythng close to the standard now in place, will be unaffordable and inappropriate in view of the demographic changes toward an older population and the increasing age-specific incidence rate of some chronic diseases which inevitably will occur in China's future.

Open Heart Surgery D. Electronic Fetal Monitoring E. Coronary Care Units F. CT Scanning G. Case Examples of the CT Scanner H. B Ultrasound I. Radiation Therapy J. Lunig Cancer Screening K. Renal Dialysis L. Schizophrenia and Insulin Coma Therapy 2. Those sections which cover financial costs and profits of technologies in use should be interpreted to provide general estimates and guidance only. The concepts used also need to be correctly understood -- the financial losses or profits to a hospital are just that, income flows less than or greater than the marginal hospital cost incurred in providing the procedure. Financial losses or profits to \"China\" are net flows to the health sectot. Any profits incurred by the health sector must of course represent subsidies or payments from elsewhere -- in this case usually the Government and Labor Insurance Systems, or patients. These are the main sources of payment for use of technologies. These sections could stimulate further, more refined cost assessment studies. The basic message is clear, however, and is unlikely to be changed by further study -- prices charged for use of some newer technologies substantially exceed the costs which the hospitals are responsible to cover, and the hospitals thus benefit financially. The result is that there is an incentive to the hospitals to use the equipment frequently, especially for insured patients who do not bear the costs of these procedures. There is also an incentive for hospitals to try to acquire more such equipment. 3. China needs to find new ways to regulate acquisition of sophisticated technologies and to set pricing policies for its use. In general, these policies should be \"neutral\" in providing hospitals incentive or disincentive to use the equipment. Patient needs and medical judgments should do this, and even in these factors there will be incentives toward overu &IL4 ient 2 to 4. The electroencephalograph (EEG) is a machine that measures the electrical activity of the brain. Electrodes are placed on the patient's scalp in defined locations and recordings are made of the electrical activity that reaches the surface. The result is wave patterns that are described in terms of duration, amplitude, and form (Harner). Abnormalities usually are indicated by an unusual amount of slow rhythms and a depression of normal rhythms in a particular area of the brain. The only specific finding is seizure disorders, which are associated with characteristic spike patterns. 5. EEG patterns are affected by such factors as the level of awareness, the body's acid-base equilibrium, and the blood sugar levels of the patient. Unfortunately, changes produced by such physiologic events are not distinguishable from pathological states (Kiloh et al). Thus, one may say that EEG patterns are sensitive in finding abnormalities, but they have limited specificity (tend to show false positives). Few studies of the diagnostic accuracy of EEG have been done. Klass and Daly (1979) report that tumors of the cerebral hemispheres are associated with brain wave abnormalities in 90 percent of the cases, and that these are localized in about 80 percent of the cases. 6. The utility of the EEG has been much affected by technological developments. For example, a CT scan is much more specific than an EEG in diagnosing brain tumors. In fact, the EEG is so imprecise in this area that important treatment decisions cannot usually be made based on its results. Similarly, a special radiological commission recommended that any patient with serious neurological signs after a head injury should have a CT scan and that skull x-ray should not be done (Thornbury et al). The only clear continuing uses of EEG in modern medicine are for the diagnosis of epilepsy, the diagnosis of death (brain death), and the monitoring of anesthesia (Klass and Daly). It may also be helpful in monitoring the status of newborns, especially very small ones (Gumnit). For these reasons any patient with apparently serious neurological disease should be referred to a higher level hospital if possible, and preferably to one with a CT scanner. 7. Despite the limited utility of EEG, it has continued to spread in U.S. hospitals (Russell). In 1955, just over 60 percent of hospitals with 300 or more beds had EEG, but by 1975, essentially all hospitals of this size had acquired it. Among hospitals of fewer than 100 beds, essentially none had the technology in 1955, but about 20 percent had acquired it by 1975. Russell believes that the continued spread of EEG is due to its usefulness in determining brain death, that is, showing that the patient is beyond hope of recovery. It is also worth noting that Russell found that the diffusion of EEG machines was related to the extent of hospital insurance, indicating the importance of financial incentives. 8. The price of an electroencephalograph varies between US$4,000 and US$50,000 (ECRI). It is customary to have one technician to operate the machine, and an expert neurologist or psychiatrist to make the interpretation.

Few data are available concerning the diffusion of EEG machines in China. Observations in Chinese hospitals, however, indicate that the EEG is almost universal in larger hospitals and is used quite extensively as a diagnostic tool. The Affiliated Hospital of Jining Medical College, which is specialized in neurological disease and neurosurgery, has an intensively used CT head scanner, but also has a Chinese-made EEG machine that cost Rmb. 8,000 in 1982. It does 3,000 examinations a year. Jinan Municipal Hospital also has a Chinese-made EEC machine, plus a Japanese-made machine purchased in 1982, both used 8 hour., a day. The Provincial Hospital of Shandong also has two EEG machines, one Japanese and one from Shanghai. The Taian County Hospital has a Japanese-made EEG machine, used to diagnose causes of headache, cerebrovascular problems, and to verify the existence of suspected brain tumors. The Qilu Petrochemical Corporation Hospital, Shandong Province, has a CT scanner, but also has a 1986-model Nihon (Japanese) EEG machine, costing Rmb. 77,000. The Shaoxing Second Hospital in Zhejiang Province has a Chinese-made machine that cost Rmb. 13,000. 10. Observations in these and other Chinese hospitals indicate that use of the EEG does not seem to be focused in the areas of obvious usefulness mentioned above, but in general diagnosis, such as that concerning headaches, strokes, brain tumors, brain trauma, and other physical problems within the skull. For these uses, its lack of specificity as a tool raises serious concerns. The EEG is not an effective diagnostic tool for these purposes, and thus cannot be considered a cost-effective measure. 11. Costs of an EEG may be estimsted as shown in the table below. The fee for an EEG examination is about Rmb. 8 (Zhejiang Province). Assuming 10 examinations a day, six days a week, an EEG machine will produce annual revenue of approximately Rmb. 25,000. This far exceeds the cost to the hospital of doing the examination. There is thus an incentive to continue to use this procedure, which is of limited or no benefit in most cases. 12. In summary, the EEG is a diagnostic tool that may be considered outmoded for most purposes. It continues to have utility in a limited range of conditions. Overall pricing of EEG examinations may contribute to China's increasing health care costs. At the same time, present pricing encourages overuse of EEGs to generate additional income for hospitals, as they do not have to bear the full cost of the technology. The best strategy China could adopt would seem to be to encourage EEG machines in hospitals and institutes specialized in neurological diseases such as epilepsy and to discourage its purchase or use in other intstitutions. Prices and cost responsibilities should be adjusted to give a neutral use incentive.9/ (See endnotes for references.)

Attachment 2 to Annex ChaRter 7 -i.33 - B. ECG and Vectorcardiographic Services 13. The ECO (electro-cardiograph) machine is a technology for recording the electrical signals from the heart. From three leads placed on the extremities it gives data related to two major aspects of cardiac function: the depolarization of the heart as it beats and the speed and rhythm of the heart beat. The ECG is primarily useful for the diagnosis of myocardial infarction (heart attack). Other diagnoses from the ECG include heart block and blocked coronary arteries (ascertained in the so-called stress test, when a person exercises while an electrocardiogram is recorded) and disorders of heart rhythm. These accompany many conditions, including myocardial infarction, and also may be primary disorders resulting from in-born abnormalities in the beart. Many rhythm disorders can be effectively treated, and they can be life-threatening without treatment. A specialized use of ECG is in the cardiac intensive care unit, when disorders of cardiac rhythm following a myocardial infarction are life-threatening and can usually be treated (see case of CCU). 14. The ECG may be one of the most overused of medical technologies as it is usually done as a routine diagnostic procedure and often repeated even when previously normal. These examinations are of limited value. For diagnostic testing the main indications for an ECG are (i) in myocardial infarction if therapy is considered (either cardiac intensive care or more aggressive therapies such as thrombolytic drugs); (ii) in assessment of possible coronary artery blockages, especially if coronary artery surgery is considered; (iii) in heart block, when a pacemaker is considered; and in disorders of rhythm. ECG is also an important part of patient monitoring during and after surgery. 15. The vectorcardiosraph uses two leads to collect the electrical information. While some have attempted to show that the vectorcardiogram is specifically useful, it contains no information not recorded by the two leads, so it actually provides less information than the ECG (Friedman). Recent research has failed to find advant. 2s of the vectorcardiogram over the ECG (Lui et al). In addition, the vectorcardiogram does not present information on cardiac rate and rhythm. 16. A single channel electrocardiograph machine costs from US$1,000 to US$4,600. A multi-channel machine costs from US$1,500 to US$11,950 (ECRI). Nihon (Japanese-made) ECG machines observed in different hospitals in China cost from Rmb. 12,000 to 17,000. A good Chinese-made ECG machine made in Shanghai costs about Rmb. 1,200. Vectorcardiographs are not in wide use in Western countries and comparative prices are not easily available. A Nihon vectorcardiograph costs in the range of US$5,0000-10,000. 17. The ECG is often a highly profitable examination in Western countries. It takes a skilled interpreter less than five minutes to read a normal ECG, which makes up the vast majority of tracings. In the Netherlands, a cardiologist is paid 35 guilders (almost US$20) for each ECG he reads. The fee is even higher in the United States. Attachment 2 to Annex Chavter 7 -7.34 - 18. Most hospitals in China have ECG machines, and frequently have vectorcardiographs as well. For example, the Jinan Municipal Hospital has three ECG machines, two Chinese and one of Japanese manufacture, and a vectorcardiograph of Japanese manufacture. Shaoxing Second Hospital in Zhejiang Province has a Chinese-made machine costing Rmb. 1,700 in 1984 and a Nihon (Japanese) machine that cost Rmb. 3,600 in 1986 (the Chinese machine is used primarily for portable ECGs taken in the wards). The hospital did about 15,000 ECGs during the first 9 months of 1987. 19. The usual fee for an ECG examination is Rmb. 6 for a full examination and Rmb. 2 for a one channel recording. Costs of the ECG examinations are estimated in the table below. The fee covers the cost of providing the service at high utilization rates, so there is an incentive to do more ECGs. 20. An unusual technology phenomenon in China is the polygraph, which charts the following cardiac functions: 1) ECG; 2) heart sounds; 3) tissue resistance; 4) apex beat of the heart; 5) time of cardiac systole (contraction); 6) blood pressure. For example, the Provincial Hospital of Shandong has a Japanese polygraph, made by DISA. The Jining First People's Hospital has a polygraph that it uses 4-5 times a day; its fee is Rmb. 5 for uninsured people and Rmb. 10 for insured, but it can go up to Rmb. 20 depending on its use. The parameters measured with the polygraph, with the exceptions of the ECG and the blood pressure, are medically useless. Yet officials of the MOPH report that this is one of the most sought-after pieces of medical equipment (as indicated by a survey of technology in large hospitals; it is also one of the most prevalent technologies). It is a considerably more expensive machine than even the fanciest ECG. 21. In summary, the use of the ECG in China illustrates a number of points: 1) a standard procedure that is cheap for one examination can be very costly in the aggregate; 2) the EGG is an essential part of a number of medical functions, some of which are certainly cost-effective; 3) the ECG is part of some medical functions that raise important resource allocation questions for China, such as cardiac intensive care; 4) the ECG is a part of other diagnostic tests that are probably of no value at all. Vectorcardiographs and polygraphs for most diagnostic procedures appear to be doubtful value, or at best, less cost effective than the ECG. These factors call for careful selection of patients who may benefit from a certain diagnostic procedure and neutral pricing of the procedure so that there is not an incentive to the hospital or the physician to overuse or underuse it.!/ (See endnotes for references.)

Attachment 2 to Annex Chapter 7 -7.36 - C. Open Heart Surgery 22. Open heart surgery became possible with the development of the heart-lung machine in the 1950s. It then became possible to stop the action of the heart to make repairs to it. The procedures in common use today include the surgical repair of the valves and walls of the heart, the replacement of natural heart valves with man-made ones, and the coronary artery bypass graft (CABG), in which blood vessels that supply blood to the heart itself and which are blocked because of arteriosclerosis, are replaced with lengths of blood vessel taken from elsewhere in the patient's body. 23. The benefits of open heart surgery vary with the type of procedure and the condition of the patient. Children who are disabled by with congenital heart disease or rheumatic heart valve disease can often live normal lives after surgery. Heart valves damaged by other processes in adults can also often be replaced with the patient being able to return to normal function. 24. Coronary artery disease surgery is not so dramatic in its success, but it does relieve symptoms of chest pain, and gives prolongation of life in selected patients. The risks of open heart surgery include morbidity such as post-operative infection; death rates following such surgery are approximately 1 percent. 25. Open heart surgery is expensive. In addition to the heart-lung machine, the operating room requires monitoring equiDment to check the patient's condition and life support equipment such as defibrilletors and respirators. Laboratory and x-ray tests must also be available near by, and a blood bank is essential. In the United States, more than half of the high cost ($15,000 to $20,000) is the surgeon's fee. Open heart surgery should only be done in facilities that do the procedure frequently, at least 200 to 300 times a year (Roche and Stengle). 26. In China, the costs of the procedure are lower. For example, the Shanghai Chest Hospital made a heart-lung machine itself in 1958, and they are now using the fourth model. Oxygenators that cost US$400 from the U.S. are made in China and sold for US$10. Artificial valves are made in the hospital and sold through-out China. Equipment can be used much more intensely; the Shanghai Chest Hospital does about 1000 open-heart operations a year, about half of which are for mitral stenosis (rheumatic heart valve disease); most of the rest are for different congenital heart problems, usually operated in infancy. The cost of the hospitalization, which is a substantial part of the cost in the United States, is low (Rmb. 3.5 a day). Surgery fees are much less than they would in the United States. The fee for open-heart'surgery in Shandong Province is about Rmb. 50 (Jining First People's Hospital). This fee does not cover the costs of doing the procedure, however, and thus gives a negative incentive to hospitals. This points to the need to raise fee levels but raises issues about how to equitably and effectively finance these costs. 27. Another example is the Shaoxing Municipal Hospital in Zhejiang Province. Open heart surgery is being developed in cooperation with Ren Ji Hospital in Shanghai because of the high rate of congenital heart disease. The hospital already had a heart-lung machine made in Shanghai in 1982, which cost Rmb. 14,000. The hospital purchased a Narkon Drager Anesthesia Machine (USA), costing Rmb. 99,000, and other U.S.-made monitoring equipment costing Rmb. 90,000. They were able to get a special Attachment 2 to Annex Chapter 7 -7.37 - allocation of Rmb. 200,000 from the Municipal Health Bureau to buy the equipment. The other costs of starting the program were paid from the operating budget. By early 1988, 6 cases had been done. The fee for the surgery is Rmb. 300 and anesthesia and post-surgical care costs about the same. The total cost of the procedure per patient is calculated by the hospital to be about Rmb. 1700. 28. About 200 hospitals in China now can do open heart operations. The estimated number done in 1985 in the 53 major hospitals was 6400; the national number being done is probably less than 25,000. This includes surgery for congenital conditions, rheumatic heart disease, and coronary bypass surgery. Limitations include a shortage of heart surgeons and skilled operating teams, a shortage of equipment, and a shortage of blood. It is worth noting that hospitals doing a small number of procedures will also be associated with excess morbidity and mortality risk. 29. There are an estimated 410,000 cases of rheumatic heart disease in China who need surgery (80,000 need valve replacement). The yearly incidence of congenital heart defects is around 300,000 a year. Thus, if one assumed that 100,000 cases of rheumatic heart disease were operated a year, the total \"need\" is about 400,000 operations a year. Many of those with congenital and rheumatic heart disease are now physically handicapped, but could lead rather normal lives after surgery. It may be that much of this surgery could be a quite cost-effective investment for China. Williams (1985), for example, found that valve replacement for aortic stenosis was quite cost-effective in relation to other surgical procedures on the heart. An intensive program to prevent rheumatic heart disease (primary health worker training, parental education, anti-biotic therapy) might be an even better investment. There would still, however, be a backlog of people with disease needing surgery. 30. On the other hand, China needs to consider what to do with coronary artery bypass surgery, especially considering its rising rate of cardiovascular disease as the population ages and length of smoking exposure increases. Coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG) is already done in China. The Shanghai Chest Hospital did its first case in January 1980, and had done 60 by August 1987. The table below shows rates of open heart surgery in Europe, mostly made up of CABG. Assuming a Chinese rate of 100 CABG operations per million, another 100,000 open heart procedures would be needed for this purpose. CABG is considered to be cost-effective in Western countries, where it has been studied systematically. Whether it is or can be cost-effective in China is a question. 31. Treatments for coronary artery disease are evolving rapidly. For example, thrombolytic (drug) therapy for acute myocardial infarction shows promise. Percutaneous transluminal coronary angioplasty (PTCA), or balloon angioplasty, is now considered a standard procedure in Western countries, and is much cheaper than CABG, but the catheter, which can only be used once, costs about US$500 in China. Laser angioplasty is now being done for coronary disease in a number of countries, and may supplant CABG in time, since it is less invasive and much less costly. These future alternatives offer interesting choices for China. 32. In summary, open heart surgery can be a highly cost-effective procedure, especially in children. In China, the capacity to do open heart surgery appears to be considerably below the need. One problem is that a hospital doing the open heart Attachment 2 to Annex Chapter 7 -7.38 - surgery loses money on the procedure, as indicated by the cases above. It would be a cost-effective strategy for China to encourage more open heart surgery for those patients who can clearly benefit from it.!/ (See endnotes for references.)

Electronic Fetal Monitoring 33. Monitoring of fetal status during labor has been done throughout history (Banta and Thacker). Auscultation of the fetal heart rate (listening with a stethoscope or fetoscope) has been part of labor management for more than 100 years. Electronic fetal monitoring (EFM) is a technology developed in the United States and Europe in the late 1970s and early 1980s. It is done either externally, using Doppler ultrasound, or internally by attaching electrodes directly to the fetus to monitor the electrocardiogram (ECG), or by sequential use of both techniques prior to and after rupture of the amniotic sac. 34. EFM resulted from years of research on fetal monitoring. The rapidity of its diffusion, however, can probably be explained by an unchanging (and rather high) infant mortality rate in the United States during the mid-1970s. It spread rapidly into use and was available in all specialized obstetrical services in the United States by 1976. Subsequently, it spread into Europe and other industrialized countries. More than 70 percent of labors in the United States are monitoring electronically. The figure varies from country to country, but is generally lower in Europe. Less developed countries have low rates of EFM use. 35. In the U.S. the benefits of EFM are considered to be the prevention of death and morbidity of the fetus. According to this conception, the monitor discovers dangerous conditions in the fetus that would not otherwise be found and allows intervention, especially Cesarean section. 36. Because it intruded on a natural birth process, EFM was controversial from its beginning. The controversy led to a number of well-designed studies. Early studies, while showing no benefit, were too small to be considered statistically significant. However, recent studies have involved large sample sizes (as many as 35,000 women). The only benefit shown is a reduction of neonatal seizures; this finding is of unknown significance, since such seizures do not seem to be associated with later problems for the child. EFM procedures have also been shown in these trials to be associated with an increased rate of operative interventions, including Cesarean sections and forceps deliveries (Thacker). Other studies have shown complications for both mother and child, including infection and laceration (Banta and Thacker). 37. EFM is an example of a procedure that is not expensive in each case, but can be very expensive in the aggregate because of the large number of deliveries and because of the cost of associated procedures such a Cesarean section. A typical monitor costs about US$6,000 (ECRI). Electronic monitoring alone has been estimated in the United States to add about US$33 to the cost of a delivery. The total costs of EFM in the United States, including the costs of such complications as infection, were estimated at US$411 million in 1977. Banta and Thacker (1978). More than half of this cost was for Caesarean sections. 38. Electronic fetal monitoring is beginning to diffuse quickly into China. For example, the Taian Councy Hospital, Shandong Province, has a Japanese-made ultrasound fetal monitor. The monitor is not used routinely, because the hospital has 2400 deliveries a year and it can only be used on one woman at a time. However, about half of deliveries have EFN at some point. The hospital has a Cesarean Attachment 2 to Annex ChARter 7 -7.40 - section rete of abou. 10 percent, somewhat above the national average. It would like to have the capability to monitor all deliveries. The Xian Central Hospital is another hospital that uses electronic fetal monitoring of some deliveries. Since no analysis has been done of these hospitals to indicate what they expect as benefits from EFM, this can only be characterized as uncritical acceptance of standards of Western medicine. 39. In summary, EFH is a technology that probably should never have diffused in any country. It is now entrenched in the obstetric services of a number of countries, and attempts are beginning to reduce or end its use. China has an opportunity in this case to halt the diffusion of an expensive, potentially harmful, and apparently useless technology.!/ (See endnotes for references.) -7.41 - E. Coronary Care Units 40. A coronary care unit (CCU) is a special hospital unit for the purpose of monitoring and giving intensive care to those with life-threatening heart problems. A coronary care unit includes a cardiac monitor, to follow the status of the heart beat; a defibrillator, for use when a serious disorder of heart rhythm develops; a respirator, to be used by patients who can no longer breathe independentlv; and various drugs, such as those to maintain the blood pressure. A CCU must also provide 24-hour nursing and physician care. 41. The usual patient in a CCU has had an acute myocardial infarction, and often has problems of heart rhythm or blood pressure. The benefits of CCUs have been somewhat controversial, since the only randomized clinical trials that have been eone (both in England) have shown no benefits of coronary intensive care over home care for acute myocardial infarction. Still, case reports of patients with severe disorders of rhythm that would have caused death without CCU care, and of patients with other problems, make clear that CCUs do preserve life in some instances. 42. CCUs are also dangerous. They are stressful places to be, both for patients and staff. It may be that the reason that clinical trials have failed to show benefits from them is that some patients die because of the current stress of CCU care. 43. CCU care is expensive. One ECG arrhythmia monitor costs US$10,850 to US$26,555 (ECRI). A defibrillator to US$9,000. A ventilator costs US$5,000 to US$15,000. These constitute minimal equipment for a CCU. Typical staffing would include approximately one nurse per bed and at least one physician per unit. 44. CCU care is beginning to diffuse into China. Many hospitals have monitoring equipment, but have not developed a true CCU. Other hospitals have defined space and staff, but have no patients; this seems to indicate that some CCUS have been developed in inappropriate sites. One example of a well-staffed CCU that is fully utilized is the Second Affiliated Hospital of Zhejiang Medical University. The hospital has four Hewlitt-Packard wireless monitors, four cable monitors, a rhythm interpreter, and a cardiac output measurement device (costing about US$110,000). The CCU also has a U.S.-made defibrillator (costing US$10,000) and a U.S.-made ventilator (costing US$15,000). The unit has three nurses and one physician on duty around the clock. The charge is Rmb. 100 per day, drugs extra. 45. The cost of CCU care is estimated in the table following. Fees exceed costs, according to this data, so a hospital has an incentive to provide the care even when it is not really needed. 46. In summary, coronary care units are an apparently effective technology for some patients with serious heart disorders, especially acute myocardial infarction. The care in a unit is expensive, however, mainly because of high equipment costs and intensive staff:patient ratios. At the same time, present fees have been set well above costs, which will give hospitals an incentive to acquire and use coronary care units. -7.42- Financial Costs of Providing a Coronary Care Unit Based on 24 Hour a Day Operation of a 4-Bed Unit Currency Unit: Rmb.

The computed tomography (CT) scanner is a technological advance that uses x-ray, special sensors, the computer, and an imaging device such as a video screen to produce cross-sectional images of the human body. The CT scanner was introduced to the world market in 1972. It is a fundamental advance in medical diagnosis, giving information that was not previously available. 48. The CT scanner has posed a national policy issue in a number of countries. It has probably been the most rapidly diffusing medical technology in history (Banta, 1985), and most countries have now begun to regulate its diffusion. The number of scanners and the number per million inhabitants are given for selected countries in the first table below. Analyses of United States data have pointed to many factors as being associated with rapid diffusion, and indicate that financial reimbursement and profit factors are important (Banta; OTA). 49. The first scanners could only produce images of the head, particularly the inside of the skull. That is particularly useful because the skull makes it difficult to obtain information on the structure of the brain. Early analyses showed that CT scanning wan particularly useful in head trauma, where its use forestalled invasive and dangerous diagnostic procedures, including neurosurgery. More advanced scanners were able to produce images of any part of the body. Becavse the head scanner is uniq'iely useful, dedicated head scanners are still produced, although Western countries primcrily buy body scanners and use part of their capability for imaging the head. 50. The utility of the CT body scanner continues to be less clear, mainly because of the many other diagnostic tests that give information on areas such as organs in the abdomen. Ultrasound, for example, is cheaper and often as effective as CT body scanning. 51. The major reason for concern about the utility of the CT scanner is its high capital cost; a head scanner costs about US$200,000, while a body scanner can cost more than US$1.5 million, depending on the features of the device (ECRI). In the United States, the prices for scans in the 1970s averaged more than US$200, substantially more than the cost of providing the scan (OTA). The price today in the United States averages over US$400 per scan. 52. The first CT scanners were imported by China about ten years ago. No data are available on subsequent diffusion, but it is assumed that it was slow at first and became relatively rapid by the mid-1980's. The MOPH estimated that by 1986 there were 170 CT scanners China, but that figure could be conservative. Shandong Provincial authorities stated that their Province alone has 24. In 1986, the MOPH estimated the number of units in certain cities as follows: Beijing -27, Shanghai -17, Tianjin -8, and Guangzhou - 53. In 1986, China imposed a yearly national import quota for CT scanners (administered by the MOPH). The Ministry proposed 70 scanners be approved for import in 1987, but the State Economic Commission approved only 50. Attag%e\u00abnt 2 to *X e Ch ! -7.44 - 54. The costs of a CT scan in China is estimated in the second table below. The critical point in the estimation is the number of hours the scanner operates. Costs can be as low as Rmb. 33 a scan. The cost to the hospital is even lower. It is clear that those hospitals which purchased CT scanners with loans were able to pay back the loans completely in less than a year. As a hospital is allowed to keep up to 60 percent of its profits, it might net hundreds of thousands of yuan each year. The incentive for acquiring and using scanners is obvious. 55. The policy of the governmen, authorities in this case is to shift technological costs from the government to insurance and self-pay sources. However, by allowing such high fees, price bureaus make it impossible for poor peasants to have scans, or force them to go heavily into debt. This planned inequity raises ethical and social concerns.!/ (See endnotes for references.) The distribution of CT scanners by country, 1986.

Case Examples of the CT Scanner 56. In Shanghai Municipal Hospital, the staff became convinced that they needed a CT scanner because they believed there would be significant social benefits and that the CT scanner would be cost-effective. However, no formal analysis or collection of data was done to support this conclusion. The hospital considered a number of different possibilities, discussing specifics of the model and price with each manufacturer. The price for the first year contract, including training and any necessary repairs and parts, was US$580,000. Subsequent contracts for maintenance and spare parts will have to be negotiated with the vendor. The hospital received 50 percent of the purchase price from a budgetary allocation by the Municipal Health Bureau. In addition, the hospital was able to acquire an interest-free loan from the Bureau for 30 percent of -the price that must be paid back within 8 years. The other 20 percent was found within hospital revenues, although one-third of that was borrowed from enterprises that have contracts with the hospital. The Municipality of Shanghai set the fee at Rmb. 400 for a body scan for insured people and Rmb. 200 for uninsured people. This scanner will be highly profitable for the hospital at reasonable utilization rates (see below). The hospital has no definite plan for the use the scanner, but will leave it to the order of the physician in charge of the case. Criteria to be used will be medical necessity and affordability. However, how to define these factors and how to limit the number of CT scans has not been determitled. 57. Shandong Provincial Hospital provides an example of how different the process of-CT acquisition can be from hospital to hospital. The Affiliated Hospital of Jining Medical College specializes in neurological and neurosurgical procedures, and so felt that it needed a CT head scanner. A Shimadzu (Japanese) CT head scanner, costing US$235,000 was ordered in 1984. The money was obtained from two sources: 1) a three-year loan at 6 percent interest for Rmb. 500,000 was obtained from the Jining Municipal Bank, which had access to the foreign currency required; 2) the peasants in the locale were asked to donate Rmb. 500,000. Hospital staff estimate the running cost (including 5 salaries, maintenance, etc.) at about Rmb. 40,000 per year. With this staffing, they can run 24 hours a day. They performed 1817 scans between April 10, 1987 and August 23, 1987. The fee for insured patients (40 percent of patients) is Rmb. 120, and is Rmb. 80 for uninsured. These fees are regulated by the Provincial Price Bureau. At these rates, the hospital should be able to pay off the scanner in approximately one year and subsequently will profit considerably. -7.47 - 58. The diagnoses found in the positive scans for a period from April to August 1987 broke down as follows: Cerebral infarction 327 34.82% Cerebral hemorrhage 143 15.23% Brain Inijury skull brain tumor 142 15.12% Brain abscess 14 1.49% Cysticercosis brain 17 1.81% Hydrocephalus 25 2.66% Others 32 3.41% 59. What is most interesting about this list, which is generally similar to what might see in an American or European hospital, is that many of the diagnoses cannot be treated effectively. Those with clear treatment include injury and abscess and, perhaps, some of the cereLral hemorrhage. However, cerebral infar^tion and brain atrophy are untreatable, and those two categories make up 50 percent of the diagnoses. 60. On the other hand, given the growing importance of accidents as a cause of injury and death, the CT scanner might be quite cost-effective for China in limited circumstances. For example, the Weinan Prefecture Hospital in Shaanxi Province reports that trauma is its second most frequent cause of death, largely because of brain injury. In 1987, the hospital sent 40 cases to Xian for CT scanning, and had a number of others who would have had a CT scan had a scanner been more accessible. The hospital does other diagnostic tests, such as EEG and skull x-ray, which are on-specific for this cause. It might even be that the CT scanner could save money for the health system if it were rationally.deployed. The Xian Municipal Hospital reports that it scanned 4000 cases of head injury in 1987 with its CT scanner; 60 percent of the scans were positive. The examinations resulted in more than 200 neurosurgical procedures in this hospital, plus others done in referring hospitals. Unfortunately, no before-and-after mortality statistics are available, but it seems likely that they would have improved and that the rates of other procedures, including exploratory surgery, have dropped. 61. In summary, the CT scanner has become a highly-sought-after technology in China. Under controlled circumstances, the CT scanner can be quite cost-effective. The case illustrates some of the deficiencies of health planning in China, including the late development of controls, some inappropriate incentives encouraging the acquisition of high-technology diagnostic equipment, and inadequate use of epidevmiological data and cost-effectiveness considerations in planning. It also gives a good indication of some of the meanings of economic reforms for the health system of China. A 4 2 7,1 -7.48 - H. B Ultrasound 62. Ultrasound diagnostic equipment makes use of high frequency sound waves to produce images of internal organs and tissues. B ultrasound can provide images of such organs as the liver, pancreas, kidney, and bladder. Tumors and kidney stones can be seen and some cardiac problems can be diagnosed, for example abnormal heart valve function, which often occurs with rheumatic valvular disease. Ultrasound is used in internal medicine, surgery, obstetrics, gynecology, ophthalmology, and other areas. As far as it is known, ultrasound is safe. It is not based on ionizing radiation, as are x-ray machines and CT scanners. 63. Ultrasound abdominal scanners cost US$10,000 to US$47,950 (ECRI). Ultrasound heart diagnostic machines (usually known as echocardiographs) cost US$10,000 to US$55,000. Ultrasound diagnostic instruments are diffusing very rapidly throughout the world. They are particularly difficult to control because of the relatively small capital investment and the large number of applications. 64. In China, ultrasound instruments are now used in all large hospitals and many medium and small-sized hospitals. As illustrated in the table below, the financial incentive for a hospital to acquire and intensively utilize ultrasound is considerable. The Zhejiang Provincial Tumor Hospital in Hangzhou has an Aloka B ultrasound unit that cost US$60,000 three years ago. Three doctors and one nurse-aide staff this unit. The charge is Rmb. 15, plus Rmb. 4 for a polaroid picture. The Shaoxing Second Hospital in Zhejiang Province has two Hitachi B ultrasound units. Three doctors work with the units. Each machine cost Rmb. 250,000, and the fee for an examination is Rmb. 15. The Shaoxing City People's Hospital has an Aloka ultrasound unit purchased in 1985 for Rmb. 146,000. It has been used 18,974 times and has produced an income of Rmb. 275,000. In 1987, it was used 8240 t1wes. The Weinan Prefecture Hospital in Shaanxi Province has an Aloka heart B ultrasound scanner that cost Rmb. 230,000 in 1987. The money was obtained from the prefectural Finance Bureau. The charge for a scan is Rmb. 25. 65. In summary, ultrasound scanning is diffusing rapidly throughout China. Ultrasound scanning is a useful and relatively inexpensive technology for any relatively large hospital. However, the incentives to overuse it are great. Although the capital cost is low, in the aggregate it has cost China much more than CT scanning. It is a good example of a low capital cost but high aggregate cost technology.

Radiation therapy involves the use of ionizing radiation (such as x-rays) as a treatment method. The earliest x-ray therapy was given with radium or x-ray machines. However, these sources were largely replaced by cobalt therapy machines in the early 1950s. Cobalt was the first good, relatively inexpensive, source of supervoltage quality. (Radiation therapy is ordinarily divided into orthovoltage -less than one million volts, supervoltage -one million more, and megavoltage -more than ten million volts). Cobalt machines with megavoltage capacity were subsequently developed. Finally, linear accelerators have partially replaced cobalt machines. Linear accelerators also produce high-energy x-radiation in the megavoltage range. 67. Radiation therapy is used almost exclusively for the treatment of cancer. In some cases, the therapy can be curative. In many cases, the radiation is used for palliation, that is to relieve symptoms and improve functioning without affecting the ultimate outcome. In the United States, about 70 percent of those with cancer receive radiation therapy during the course of their illness (Russell). This treatment is about equally divided between attempts at possible cure and relieving side effects of an incurable cancer. 68. Radiation therapy is seldom used alone as a primary treatment for cancer. Ordinarily, it is used with surgery, and for some cancers, radiation therapy, surgery, and chemotherapy are combined. Common cancers where radiation therapy is often part of the treatment include cancers of the lung, breast, bladder, and ovaries. Long-term survival results of radiation therapy are good for lymphomas (including Hodgkin's disease), and are also good in combination with surgery for breast cancer and colon cancer. 69. A major difficulty with radiation therapy is its side effects: the radiation damages both cancerous tissue and normal tissue. Orthovoltage sources deliver the maximum dose to the skin, so should only be used for treating cancers on or close to the surface. The higher the voltage, the higher the proportion of the radiation that is delivered to the deeper tissues. Supervoltage (and megavoltage) is also better focused than orthovoltage, and does not scatter so much to surrounding normal tissues. 70. A cobalt machine costs about US$180,000, and needs replacement every three to eight years (ECRI; Russell). A Chinese-made cobalt machine costs considerably less, about Rmb. 200,000 (about US$54,000) A linear accelerator costs from US$400,000 to US$1.5 million, but the Chinese device costs less (Chinese experts do not consider the Chinese device satisfactory). A radiotherapy simulator and treatment planning system, considered necessary for correct planning of radiation therapy, costs another US$50,000 to US$240,000 (ECRI). Costs of radiation therapy with Cobalt 60 are estimated in the table below. 71. U.S. sources state that a fully equipped radiation therapy center should have both a supervoltage and a megavoltage source, and should also have Attachment 2 to Annex Chapter 7 -7.51 - orthovoltage and superficial (about fifty kilovolts) machines. In Europe, planning programs generally regulate radiation therapy facilities. The present numbers of megavoltage machines for various countries (both Cobalt and linear accelerators) are shown in the table that follows. 72. The total number of machines in China is not known. Radiation therapy is generally available in provincial cancer hospitals but also available in many general municipal and teaching hospitals. The table below also includes the population ratio for one province. 73. Radiation therapy is available at low prices in Ci.ina, though fees vary, averaging between Rmb. 20 and Rmb. 30 for one treatment with Cobalt 60, and between Rmb. 20 and Rmb. 30 for one treatment with a linear accelerator. Incentives are rather neutral in this case. A hospital could conceivably profit at high utilization rates, but the profit would not be great. 74. In summary, it is difficult to say whether or not additional radiation therapy machines are a priority for China. The ratio of such machines to population is surely lower than in Western countries, but China may not wish to make heroic efforts to save cancer patients who at best will have low survival rates. If one assumed that 35 percent of cancer patients need treatmer.t with radiation therapy during their illness (a conservative assumption), then China needs more radiation therapy machines. On the other hand, such an investment may not be cost-effective, compared to other alternatives for cancer prevention or for prevention and treatment of other diseases.!/ (See endnotes for references.)

Attachment 2 to Annex Chapter 7 -7.53 - J. Lung Cancer Screening 75. Lung cancer is the most common lethal cancer in men in most industrialized countries, and may recently have become the leading cancer in China. Male respiratory cancer rates appear to have been rising for at least 50 years in the United States, and female rates began to rise 25 years ago and now are increasing rapidly. The same trends are almost inevitable for China over the next 3 -4 decades. In 1988, there will be an estimated 152,000 new cases of lung cancer in the United States and 139,000 deaths. Approximately three-quarters of the cases and the deaths are in males. For China, it is likely that in 1988 there were more than 120,000 men and women who died from lung cancer. 76. Lung cancer does not generally cause symptoms until relatively late in its course. At that stage, standard treatments with surgery and radiation therapy (and sometimes chemotherapy) do little to modify the ultimate course of the disease. Only about 10 percent of patients survive 5 years after diagnosis (Eddy). 77. The poor prognosis has led to proposals in the West to attempt earlier case finding through screening programs. Two tests can be used to screen for the disease: a chest x-ray and a microscopic examination of cells coughed up in sputum (sputum cytology). However, even with early case finding, treatment results are not very encouraging. The scientific literature does not show any significant be.iefit from screening for cancer of the lung, even in high-risk groups. One randomized clinical trial found no effect on mortality from a program of screening with a chest x-ray and sputum cytology every four months. Further, the screening and necessary diagnostic testing of those with positive findings are very expensive. 78. The main reason why screening programs have been ineffective is that while cigarette smoking is the major risk factor for lung cancer, the great majority of smokers (about 8 out of 10) will never get the disease. This means that the screening of this high risk group is not very productive. Moreover, screening of this same group would have to be repeated at frequent intervals to have success with early detection. 79. In the United States, these considerations led to recommendations by the American Cancer Society that lung cancer be attacked through programs to help individuals change their smoking behavior (Eddy). In addition to population- wide smoking cessation programs, if screening for other diseases such as hypertension and other cancers is done, information on the harmful effects of smoking can also be provided to those being screened. 80. In China, lung cancer seems to be rapidly developing as an important cause of death, especially in males. This result is to be expected, given the high and growing rate of smoking cigarettes in the Chinese population. The increases in rates of smoking indicate large increases in lung cancer incidence and deaths in the future. Screening programs are unlikely to be cost-effective in China for the same reasons as they are not in the West (low incidence of positive findings, need for repeated testing, expense of Attacbment 2 to Annex Chapter 7 -7.54 - testing). This implies the need for China to adopt broad, vigorous smoking cessation programs and policies as early as possible to minimize the otherwise inevitable illness and premature deaths which will occur in the next century. K. Renal Dialysis 81. Renal dialysis (or hemodialysis) is a process in which the blood is taken from the body, run through a device containing special filters that remove certain substances, and returned to the body. Hemodialysis has been used for years as a treatment for acute renal failure, poisoning, and so forth, but it could not be used over long periods of time because of the difficulty in obtaining access to the blood stream. This problem was solved in the late 1950's in the United States by Dr. Belding Scribner, who invented the so-called \"Scribner shunt,\" a tube connecting the arterial system with the venous system of the body (usually in the arm) which could remain in place for long periods of time. 82. Chronic dialysis is literally life-saving for those with \"end-stage renal disease,\" untreatable kidney disease in which the kidney no longer functions sufficiently to sustain life. The most common cause of end-stage renal disease in Western countries is diabetes. Other causes include infection and chronic glomerulonephritis. 83. Chronic renal dialysis is now provided free of charge to those with end- stage renal disease in most industrialized countries. The table below show rates of dialysis in selected countries. 84. Dialysis is costly. The machine required itself costs from US$9,500 to US$23,700 (ECRI). The procedure must be carried two or three times a week for each patient. Dialysis in a hospital or center is also staff-intensive. The average yearly cost for one person on chronic dialysis in the Netheralands is more than US$50,000. In the Netherlands, the number of patients requiring dialysis in 1986 was more than 2000, so the total cost of the program in the Netherlands is more than US$100 million (deCharro), or about 0.3 percent of the national health expenditure. In the United States, the public-funded program exceeded US$2 billion in 1987 and is projected to reach annual expenditures of more than US$3 billion by 1989, about US$33,000 per patient. 85. Thus, the efficacy of renal dialysis is not at issue. It clearly extends the lives of people who would otherwise die. Questions have focused on its high financial costs. At the same time, all Western countries have been under irresistible pressure to expand the provision of dialysis to all who can benefit from it (Banta and Kemp). By the later 1960s and early 1970s, all Western countries were providing dialysis to the entire population who needed it. A continuing issue with dialysis is that kidney transplant is considerably more cost-effective (Banta and Kemp; de Charro). 86. Dialysis is beginning to diffuse into China. The Shaoxing City People's Hospital in Zhejiang Province has a Chinese hemodialysis machine that cost Rmb. 15,000 in 1982. It has been used 302 times in all to produce an income of Rmb. 73,000. In 1987 it was used 86 times. The Shaoxing Second Hospital Attachment 2 to Annex Chapter 7 -7.55 - in Zhejiang Province has a Chinese-made hemodialysis machine that cost Rmb. 20,000. It was used 204 times in 1987. The most common cause of renal failure in China is chronic glomerulonephrities, which accounts for 82 percent of cases (Henderson et al). Costs of providing hemodialysis in China are estimated in the second table below. The fee is Rmb. 300 per treatment. This fee exceeds the cost to the hospital of providing the dialysis by a wide margin, assuming reasonable utilization of the machine. Calculations by Henderson et al (1988) also find a large profit in the fee. Thus, the incentive for the hospital is to acquire the machine and provide the dialysis. A patient on dialysis must be dialyze.' approximately 150 times a year, so the expenditures for one patient for one year are about 45,000 yuan. Patients presently on dialysis mostly have payment from their insurance, which find dialysis by far the highest expense that many work units have ever had to meet for a single employer (Henderson et al). 87. Dialysis raises concerns because of limited financial resources and the aging of the population. Each year there are an estimated 80,000 candidates for long-term dialysis in China (Henderson et al). The rates of end-stage renal disease will surely rise in the future. It must not be forgotten as well that once a patient begins dialysis, most likely he or she will receive the treatment until death, which can be many years later. Thus, policies toward chronic renal dialysis are needed. Other countries have made the entire population eligible for free, or essentially free, treatment if they develop end-stage renal disease. It seems unlikely that China can afford such a cost, an estimated 3.6 billion yuan in the first year of a universal program.

Attachment 2 to Annex ChaRter 7 -7.57 - L. Schizophrenia and Insulin Coma Therapy 88. There are about 10 million psychotic people in China, constituting one percent of the population, a rate comparable to that in most other countries. The usual therapies are tranquilizer drugs, electroshock therapy, and insulin therapy. The main use of insulin coma therapy as it evolved was with schizophrenia. It was first used by Dr. M. J. Sakel to induce mild coma in drug addicts in 1930. He later began to use it with psychotic patients, particularly schizophrenics. In insulin coma therapy, insulin is injected to lower the blood sugar level to the point that the patient is in deep coma, and even may have convulsions. 89. Schizophrenia is a severe mental disorder of unknown cause that is found all over the world. The name of the condition refers to a split or separation from reality and sometimes to a separation between emotion and thoughts. Schizophrenia is now thought to be in part due to a strong genetic predisposition. It is generally considered an incurable condition. 90. Dr. Sakel claimed an improvement of over 88 percent in schizophrenic patients. By 1936, favorable reports were coming from Switzerland, the Netherlands, Polaud, Germany, the USSR, and the United States. By 1938, 54 percent of mental institutions in the United States were using insulin coma therapy. The figure would probably have been higher, except that alternative shock therapies, metrazol therapy and electroshock therapy, were introduced almost simultaneously. The rapid spread of insulin coma therapy is largely attributable to the single-minded promotion of this type of therapy by Dr. Sakel, not only in professional journals, but also in popular magazines. 91. The rapid adoption of the therapy is particularly surprising because of the amount of care it required. The treatment sterted typically early in the morning. Each patient was confined in a bed and then injected with a dose of insulin that gradually increased as the treatment progressed. Treatment was usually given five days a week and might be continued for a long as ten weeks. Valenstein described the therapy: \"Some of the patients started to perspire and salivate. By the end of the first hour, the patient who had higher insulin doses had lapsed into a coma; many were tossing, rolling, and moaning, their muscles starting to twitch; and some had tremors And spasms ...Many trained nurses were needed to monitor this whole process. Pulse and respiration had to be taken at regular intervals. Physicians had to exercise considerable judgment about when a coma should be terminated ...a patient left in a coma too long could suffer brain damage or death. Usually after several hours, the treatment was terminated by glucose.\" 92. Insulin coma therapy never was tested by well-controlled clinical trials. The largest clinical trial was reported by Dr. Benjamin Malzberg, who compared one thousand schizophrenic patients treated with insulin to one thousand who were not. The recovery rate in the treatment group was 13 percent, compared to four percent in the control group (1938). A year later, Malzberg did a follow-up study and found that the difference had shrunk, although the insulin group remained slightly better (1939). A 1946 report from the University of Pennsylvania reported a better outcome for 400 -7.58 - schizophrenic patients given insulin coma therapy compared to those who were not, but also reported 12 deaths in the treatment group (Bond and Shurley). 93. In the 1950s, new tranquilizer drugs for schizophrenia were introduced. Insulin coma therapy began to decline in the United States. In other countries, its disappearance came later. For example, it wa3 still common in England in 1960, but had essentially disappeared 10 years lzter (Valenstein). 94. In Chin& insulin coma therapy is still widely used, although much less so than in the \u00b1960s. It is gradually being replaced with drugs. For example, about five percent of people in tho Hangzhou Seventh People's Hospital, a psychiatric hospital, are given insulin coma therapy. The figure would be higher, but insulin is in short supply. The charge for a treatment is Rmb. 0.7, plus the cost of insulin. This does not cover the cost of the therapy. 95. In summary, insulin coma therapy is an outmoded therapy. It was never adequately tested clinically or statistically, and is one of a series of therapies for schizophrenia, including electroshock therapy, that have not been demonstrated to be effective. It is also a risky procedure. It is not hard to understand why Western countries have abandoned it.!/ (See endnotes for references.) -7.59 ENDNOTE 1.

During the course of this century China has passed through four phases with regard to the training of health manpower: (1) pre-1949, a tiny number of highly trained doctors serving urban elites and the balance of the population using traditional Chinese medicine (TCM); (2) 1949-mid 1950s, a rapid expansion of output of all health manpower categories, a lowering of entrance and course requirements, and the introduction of formal training programs in TCM; (3) late 1950s-latter 1970s, much disruption of formal training programs due to the Great Leap Forward and the Cultural Revolution, and a major expansion of informal or very short-term programs during the late 1960s (barefoot doctor period); (4) latter 1970s-present, a gradual restoration and upgrading of formal training programs, much emphasis on upgrading lower level personnel, and continued emphasis on quantity (see also Section A of the Supplement to this Annex Chapter and Annex Table 8.1 for number of doctors and hospital beds by medical specialty). 2. Levels of training and occupational categories.y There are three main levels of health workers (see Annex Chart 8.1 at the end of this Chapter for a more detailed breakdown and description). High level gersonnel are trained in medical colleges which, in the great majority of cases, are not linked with a general university. Host medical colleges, despite the word \"medical\" in their name, offer a variety of undergraduate health careers such as Western and traditional Chinese medicine (TCM), public health, pediatrics, maternal and child health, stomatology (dentistry with the addition of head and neck surgery), pharmacy (Western and traditional), massage and acupuncture. New undergraduate programs have been added at some medical colleges in recent years in such fields as nutrition, management, epidemiology, statistics and health economics. The usual first degree is that of a bachelor of medicine (public health, stomatology, etc.), with masters and doctoral degrees offered for additional study. Entrance requirements include a completed high school education (12 years) plus a competitive three-day national university entrance examination. Most courses last at least five years, including an internship year. A few medical colleges have a six-year medical curriculum and one has an eight-year curriculum. The Ministry of Public Health has designated its own 13 medical colleges plus their affiliated teaching hospitals and several other well established provincial colleges as \"key\" institutions. These medical colleges have been given additional faculty and other teaching resources to help them provide leadership in the training of high level manpower. At the present time there are no plans to extend this designation to any more medical colleges than the present number. 3. A relatively new development has been the creation of what might be termed \"associate doctor\" programs, though the Chinese term for this category The tables at the end of this Annex Chapter provide more detailed historical data series on most of these topics. -8.2 - of personnel is identical to that used for the full, five-year doctor. These are three-year programs that accept students after 12 years of ger.2ral education, thus bridging the gap between high and middle level rersonnel. They cover much the same material as that taught in the medical colleges, though with relatively more emphasis on clinical subjects and less on the basic sciences. 4. Middle level personnel are trained in secondary medical -- or more appropriately -- \"health\" schools as: assistant (or associate) doctors of Western or TCM; assistant doctors of public health; as nurses; technicians; and as assistant level pharmacists, stomatologists and other such categories. Prior to the Liberation this level of personnel often had as little as six years of general schooling but since the 1940s most schools require at least nine years and some now require a completed secondary school education (12 years). Most courses last three years though some require only two years. During the Cultural Revolution many high level medical colleges were closed and most medical training required less than a high school education and only three years of medical studies. Although these doctors had lesser qualifications than today's high level doctor, many have since been upgraded through additional formal or in-service training plus a certifying exam to a category nominally equivalent to that of the fully qualified doctor. 5. Primary level health workers include a variety of independent practice and support level personnel, ranging from the village (or rural) doctor who has been upgraded from the barefoot doctor category, to the village midwife, nurse aide and assistant technician categories. This broad category of personnel is characterized by 6-9 years of general schooling, perhaps some brief pre-service training, and then varying amounts of in-service training and continuing education. Barefoot doctors who are unable to pass the examination for the title of \"village doctor\" may either end up in village- level private practice or serve as \"village health workers\". 6. Manpower deployment. Chinese health manpower data eloquently documents the enormous improvements in the supply of personnel since the 1949 Liberation but suffers from a variety of problems that limits its utility for planning purposes. There have been major quantitative and qualitative improvements in the manpower supply (see Annex Tables 8.2 and 8.3), and the manpower- population ratios have risen markedly despite a near doubling of the population. These data must be interpreted with considerable caution, however, due to: a. major fluctuations in supply statistics due to changing occupational definitions and the lack of a national credentialling system; b. a high level of data aggregation that makes it difficult to estimate supply according to such variables as urban/rural, employer, or type of work activity; and c. differences in terminology and ways of classifying occupations which make it difficult in some cases to compare Chinese manpower data with that of other countries. -8.3 - The concluding section of this Chapter presents recommendations for the improvement of manpower statistics. 7. Annex Table 8.8 shows how the supply of health personnel has increased rapidly since 1949. The substantial geographic variability in the supply of doctors is evident in Annex Table 8.15 on the distribution of health care workers. While the new administrative and financial reforms offer the prospect of more rapid health system development, they may contribute to further widening of the gaps between the more and less prosperous regions. 8. Manpower recruitment, retention and remuneration. Essentially all new health workers enter salaried employment and for some years now the typical graduate of a health training program at any of the three levels has been assured of a job, usually in a community near to where he was trainedY This situation may change significantly by the mid-1990s once the government no longer guarantees every graduate a job within his or her area of training. In January 1988 the government announced that students entering higher level training in 1989 will no longer be assigned jobs on graduation. 9. Retention. Most middle and lower level employees appear to have been, up until the present, remarkably stable in their jobs. Both for reasons of long-standing custom as well those relating to the scarcity of jobs and to the difficulty of arranging a transfer, most employees stay with the same employer throughout their working life. Higher level personnel have a somewhat easier time changing jobs but job stability is very high by Western standards. Reasons include: lack of easy ways to learn about job openings outside of one's local area or to arrange for interview3; public bus transportation is very crowded and the only other alternative is by bicycle so one is compelled to work near where one lives, and it is not easy to change residence; similar jobs pay essentially the same; and except at the highest levels of expertise it is very difficult to move up the urban -rural gradient (though it is easy to move 'down\" the gradient to a smaller city or rural area). 10. Emerging policies leading towards a greater liberalization of the job market and greater autonomy in setting wage policies will undoubtedly affect job retention and turnover rates, though it is difficult to anticipate how quickly these will change. The effects will probably not be very significant for some years, however, since salary differentials will probably remain moderate and the intrinsic difficulties of moving residence, of commuting any distance to work, and of moving to a larger city will probably tend to keep the health workforce largely \"in place\" for some time to come. The absence of a truly national job market, even at the higher levels of training, provides both advantages and disadvantages. On the positive side is the greater ability, through the location of training programs, to keep graduates in place even in less attractive regions, while on the negative side is the lack of an easy market mechanism for correcting local and regional manpower imbalances. The job allocation system is described in detail in Section B of the Supplement to this Chapter. -8.4 - 11. Remuneration and conditions of employment. Wage scales are initially set by the central government and then adjusted somewhat into at least four regional scales that take into account geographic differences in income and cost-of-living. With only a bit more than a threefold spreadY from the lowest to the highest category and less than a twofold spread from the lowest to the highest step, China has attained, by Western standards, a remarkable degree of base salary equity. These amounts are increased significantly, how-aver, by several additional sources of income and other benefits including salary supplements, bonuses, secondary employment income and vacation leave. Manpower Production. 12. Qtantitative aspects. Estimates on the annual intake and output of China's many training institutions are very approximate due both to the rapid changes that occur from year to year and to substantial local autonomy regarding enrollments. Annex Tables 8.5 and 8.6 provide estimates for recent years. 13. Qualitative aspects. China has gone through several major policy changes with regard to the orientation of its training programs. Prior to Liberation China was influenced primarily by Western models of university and departmental organization, and on curriculum design. In medical education the U.S. experience was especially important, with the Rockefeller Foundation- supported Peking Union Medical College leading the way among medical schools. After Liberation ties with the West were severed and the period of Soviet influence began. In medical education and the health sciences generally, China for the most part adopted the Soviet educational model, with the following effects: a. there was a shift away from general universities, with a wide variety of course offerings, and towards more specialized institutes or colleges which offered a narrower range of courses in individual professions such as medicine, engineering, science, the arts, etc; b. there was early differentiation among the various high level health careers such that after two years of shared basic sciences and other preparatory studies (e.g., language, political studies), students would divide into separate tracks in order to study medicine, stomatology, public health, and pediatrics; c. the Western concept of dentistry as a discipline that is essentially limited to the oral cavity became transformed into the Soviet concept of stomatology, which represents a combination of dentistry and maxillo-facial surgery; and 3/ The Supplement to this Annex Chapter gives additional detail on wage rates and spreads in Section B, para. 8. -8.5 - d. greater emphasis was put on training programs for middle level health professionals such as assistant doctors, assistant dentists, and lab technicians. 14. Educational curricula for each of the major health careers have been developed by the State Education Commission (SEdC) based on the Soviet experience. These underwent minor revisions in the 1960s, they became irrelevant during the turbulent years of the Cultural Revolution, and in 1978 the 1960s norms were once again introduced with some minor revisions and are still in effect. (See Annex Chart 8.2 for representative curricula for the key universities). A new and major revision is now under development. The guiding principal of the new norms is flexibility. The SEdC seeks to provide national level guidance to the high level medical colleges about how to design their educational programs while at the same time leaving deans with the opportunity to adjust the details according to their local needs and conditions. Similar efforts are underway by the SEdC division concerned with vocational, or middle level health training programs. 15. Curricular reform at the national level can facilitate but not guarantee improved teaching at the institutional level. Educational authorities point to their obvious resource limitations -- lack of adequate classroom accommodations, audiovisual and reference materials, and qualified faculty -- but for many an even more critical constraint is institutional resistance to change. Faculty-student ratios are, for the most part, generous, averaging around 1:6 or 1:7 for most higher level medical colleges. The challenge is to find ways to motivate both faculty and students to break long-established educational patterns which rely on large lectures, rote memorization, and light teaching loads in favor of research. The usual barriers to new ways of thinking are compounded by vivid memories of the excesses of 'educational reform* that occurred during the Cultural Revolution. Despite these problems, some encouraging developments were underway at various medical colleges and secondary health schools: a. campus-wide efforts to modernize the medical curriculum, to reduce duplication, to promote a more active student role in the learning process, to provide more electives and more time to take them, and to make greater use of audio-visual and self-instructional materials; b. development of full- and part-time continuing education programs in order to train new faculty and upgrade existing faculty skills; c. sister institution relationships so that lower level training institutions can benefit from the special resources of higher level institutions; d. creative arrangements to make it possible for primary level personnel to upgrade their qualifications to the middle level; v See the Supplement to this Annex Chapter for details. -8.6 - e. Learning Resource Centers have been established at a few medical colleges to serve as regional resources for the development and dissemination of audio-visual materials; f. a few medical colleges have established education departments or institutes in order to promote innovations in and conduct research on the process of medical education; 16. While such developments are encouraging, the process of educational reform appears handicapped by the lack of: a. external funds to promote innovation, such that most educational institutions must depend entirely on support from internal sources; b. skilled personnel and institutional mechanisms for evaluating the results of educational innovation. By 1987 some seven of China's 130 medical colleges had centers or institutes for the study of medical education and at least 40 more had research units, though most of these were very small and staff skills were limited; c. mechanisms for sharing experience across institutional boundaries. Recent efforts to correct this problem have resulted in small scale but nevertheless encouraging initiatives such as the Journal of Higher Medical Education, the Journal of Chinese Medical Education Research, and the Society of Medical Education, which has had four annual meetings and operates under the auspices of the Chinese Medical Association. 17. Specialization. Available manpower statistics provide approximate estimates of the number of doctors, nurses, etc., but little reliable information on the number of health care workers according to specialty. This is especially true of those many specialties (a recent report indicated there were at least 49 different specialties) in both Western and traditional Chinese medicine that are acquired following undergraduate training such as surgery, internal medicine, etc. Some specialties, most notably pediatrics, are in fact sub-specialties of another field (in the case of pediatrics it taught within the department of medicine at most schools), thus further complicating data collection and interpretation. Despite the lack of specialty data, several categories appear to be in very short supply, including: a. in public health, especially epidemiology, biostatistics, program planning, policy and evaluation, health services research, health education, and public health nursing; b. in medicine, especially the fields of emergency medicine, rehabilitation, gerontology, and mental health; c. in oral health, the current 1:100,000+ ratio of stomatologists to population means essentially that there is no program of oral health. -8.7 - 18. The extremely limited supply of oral health personnel warrants additional comment. As was noted earlier, stomatologists are now trained in a five-year program that includes both dentistry and maxillo-facial surgery. This pattern, based on the Soviet model, would appear to be very wasteful of an extremely scarce resource. Good head and neck surgery requires both extensive surgical training and a sufficient case load to maintain proficiency, training and practice that are almost totally irrelevant to the requirements of good dental skills. Moreover, as was the case with medicine during the decades following Liberation, China should probably emphasize the training of middle level oral health personnel during the next few decades rather than invest heavily in high level personnel. 19. Credentialing. China does not now have a national system for credentialing health personnel.Y Since virtually all high and middle level health training programs are ultimately operated by or under the general authority of government, they are effectively \"licensed\" to offer training. Once they pass their final exams, graduates are automatically authorized to practice their profession. With only one partial exception, there is no system for verifying a national level of achievement. That exception has to do with a mandatory multiple choice final exam that was established in the early 1980s by the MOPH for graduates of its 13 \"key\" medical colleges. Other medical colleges were subsequently invited to give their new graduates the same examination on a voluntary basis. The number of such participant schools rapidly climbed to around 60 but has dropped off significantly during the past several years, apparently due in large measure to disenchantment with the multiple choice nature of the exam. Manpower Policy and Planning. 20. China's \"system\" for health manpower planning and policy formulation has been, at least and until recently, not very quantitative. Judged against a theoretical model of how planning should be done, China's methods will be found wanting. Past decisions appear to have been based more on guiding principles than on detailed analysis, yet except for the excesses of the i The term \"credentialing\" refers to the process and specific measures which are used to assure the public and prospective employers that a health worker is qualified to practice his or her profession. Commonly used credentialling procedures include: certification, whereby training institutions \"certify\" through academic degrees and/or certificates that graduates have satisfactorily completed an approved course of studies; licensure, whereby a licensing agency through testing and other means determines that applicant doctors, nurses, technicians, etc. are qualified to practice their profession, and then grants them a license; registration, whereby health workers are required to periodically obtain authorization to continue their work, either by just paying a fee and informing the responsible agency of their whereabouts, or by also providing evidence of their continued qualifications for practice such as might be established through a requirement to take a specified number of continuing education credits since their last registration. -8.8 - Cultural Revolution, they seem to have produced generally good results. The key question now is whether this approach will be sufficient to guide future policy and if not, what alternative approach should be used. An overview to planning resources at the national level is outlined below. The Supplement to this Annex Chapter describes in some detail in Sections D and E how the manpower components of the Seventh Five Year Plan and Objectives for the year 2000 were approached. 21. Planning units. Educational, or supply side planning is done by the State Education Commission, which has several units of about 30-40 persons each that are concerned with all high level education and with secondary level education. A third unit is responsible for \"adult\" education, which includes part-time continuing education activities. The SEC unit responsible for high level education has a five-person section (two Western doctors, one TCM doctor, one pharmacist and one stomatologist) that devotes exclusive attention to the health sector. 22. The MOPH, which is concerned with the demand side of the manpower equation, has several units that have some responsibilities related to health manpower, though there is no single person or unit that has this as a prime responsibility. ThLese include: a. The Department of Finance and Planning which, among its six divisions, includes the Planning Division. The Planning Division has primary responsibility for the annual financial plan for hospitals and salaried personnel. Towards the end of each year summary estimates are made of the current numbers of beds, staff, and services in the MOPH system and then, based on guidance from the central government (principally, the State Planning Commission) regarding the expected increase in the MOPH allocation for the coming year, the Planning Division decides how to allocate this increase among the various resource input categories. While most of this allocation is done by a prorating process, some flexibility exists for new programs or facilities and a five-year rolling \"perspective\" plan is also developed and discussed with the SPC; b. The Center for Health Information and Statistics in the MOPH, with a staff of about 20, has recently begun to input health manpower data into its computer along with its other statistical series but this activity is still at a very early stage and other units of the MOPH, through poor inter-unit communications, have yet to make use of this resource. The Center has also participated in two provincial (Jilin and Jiangsu) health manpower studies; c. The MOPH's Department of Medical Science and Education is subdivided into three divisions concerned with high level education, middle level education, and continuing education. Each division collects its own statistics in order to monitor activities in its sector, but for the most part the divisions do not have good historical data series nor are they actively involved in planning; -8.9 - d. The State Traditional Chinese Medicine Administration (STCMA) oversees the development of TCM. This agency collects some data on TCM training and manpower deployment but is not able to do much detailed manpower planning. Plan Implementation 23. The MOPH, SEdC and other national level institutions may find themselves increasingly constrained in their ability to promote the attainment of health manpower objectives, whatever their origin. National monies descend the system to help fund training programs but most of the decision-making authority for allocating these funds among the various careers resides at the provincial level or lower, or at the institutional level. Accordingly, there is no means whereby the national level can readily direct how many health workers of a given type should be trained in a given region. Two areas -- hospital staffing and educational programming -- illustrate ways in which policies affecting manpower get translated into action. 24. Hospital staffing. The MOPH has a significantly greater role, although indirect, with regard to hospital staffing. Starting in the latter 1950s and largely based on Soviet standards, the MOPH has developed hospital staffing standards linked to the number of beds. These standards have been occasionally updated since then with the latest revision prepared in 1978. Neither staff densities nor inter-occupation staff ratios have changed much since the 1950s. In 1978, and recognizing that the standards had become out of date, the MOPH carried out a rapid national survey of several hundred hospital directors to learn of their suggestions for desired staffing ratios. From that survey the 1978 (and still current) standards call for the following staff per bed: 1.3-1.4 staff of all categories for hospitals of less than 300 beds; 1.4-1.5 for hospitals of 300 to 500 beds; 1.6-1.7 for hospitals of more than 500 beds; an additional staff increment of 122-15X for hospitals affiliated with medical universities; and slightly higher staffing densities for TCM hospitals in recognition that they require more pharmacy staff and have both TCM and Western diagnostic services. These standards are meant to provide staff for all in- and outpatient activities, and include provision for administrative and other support staff. The standards further specify that 'medical and technical staff\", (doctors, nurses, technicians, pharmacists and other professional support staff) should together represent approximately 702- 722 of all staff, and that within the medical staff category the allocations should divide approximately as follows: doctors, 252; nursing staff, 502; pharmacy staff, 82; laboratory staff, 4.6Z; radiology staff, 4.42; all others, 82. No recommendations have been made or are under consideration about the desired distribution of medical and surgical specialties. 25. There are several major realities that have served to keep staffing densities at government hospitals either at or below the MOPH norms. First, new hospitals, before they start operation, must seek the approval from the State Bureau of Institutional Staffing, with further input from the local Health Bureau ard the Labor and Personnel Bureau, for their proposed budget and staff. These authorities, in the absence of other criteria or compelling arguments to the contrary, are usually opposed to any staffing density higher -8.10 - than the MOPH norms, and hospitals are understandably not anxious to apply for less staff. Since hospitals must thereafter annually submit their budget request for the following year along with their utilization statistics, staff complement and vacancies, and since any significant upward change in the staff density without corresponding workload increases would be readily identified (and rejected), the MOPH staff ratio soon becomes a permanent reality. 26. Other factors have further limited hospital ability to deviate from MOPH staff norms. Although a hospital can theoretically allocate its allowable staff positions as it sees fit, the compelling realities of supply limitations, tradition, and a tight staffing limit have meant that inter- hospital variation within a given size and employer category has, at least within the government sector, been minor. Indeed, some hospitals operate well below the allowable quota, especially in the nursing category, but they cannot find applicants either to fill the nursing slots or other worker categories which they might consider in a lower priority. 27. The net effect of these considerations is that the MOPH standards, even though not enforced at the national level, have had a remarkable ability to determine hospital staffing densities in the great majority of China's hospitals. In 1987 the MOPH started initial planning for a round of field studies which would eventually lead to a revision of the staffing standards. Now, however, with the trend towards greater decentralization of authority, the MOPH is hesitant lo continue with the project lest it find that the standards have become Lttally irrelevant to hospital administrators. 28. Educational programming. Decision-making about the size, number, distribution, and areas of specialization of health-related educational programs is done primarily at the provincial or sub-provincial levels, with the important exceptions of decisions related to the MOPH's medical colleges and to the allocation of special funds by the SEdC. The main participants at the subnational level are the Educational Commission (which allocates educational monies), the Labor and Personnel Bureau (which advises on manpower priorities), and the Health Bureau. All three agencies are interested in health manpower issues but they usually have neither the staff nor data necessary to make informed decisions about how to allocate funds among the various health careers. They must therefore rely on the advice, or be subject to the pressures of, employers and educators of health manpower. In the case of the educators, the incentives are obvious; enrolling more students means more money (e.g. V1650 per additional student at a provincial medical university; key medical colleges get a higher rate) so the pressures from the high level health education institutions can result in limited monies being left over for the training of middle level health personnel. Whatever the source of the advice, it must be transmitted and commented upon by the Provincial Health Bureau. Not unexpectedly it appears that the safest route usually has been to distribute the annual increments pro-rata among the various careers. 29. Sub-provincial authorities and individual institutions have shown considerable initiative in coping with manpower shortages unresolved by the formal educational system. A number of hospitals have established self- study, in-service or contractual arrangements with training institutions in -8.11 - order to upgrade their personnel or even, in some cases, to train entirely new staff outside of the formal educational system. These arrangements are particularly frequent in the case of upgrading nurse aides to nurses or for training technicians. Perspectives oni the Future. 30. China's aging population and increasing prosperity will confront it with policy choices that have major implications for health manpower. The principal choices involve the amount of emphasis given to treatment versus prevention, individual versus group orientation of system, institution-based versus community-based care, 'high' technology versus \"appropriate\" technology, the urban versus the rural population. Most industria'.ized countries have emphasized the former choices and there will be strong pressures from the health professions and from the urban and more prosperous rural population to follow this route. Medical journals, study tours, and new equipment ensure that health care developments are rapidly diffused into the system and when one is confronting a serious illness, it is hard to give first priority to less glamourous and prestigious, preventive activities. The new emphasis on individual responsibility will also complicate retaining a preventive, appropriate technology orientation, since by making individual institutions responsible for their programs, high level authorities lose much of their power to direct priorities. However, to make an informed choice a better sensc of the alternatives is needed. The balance of chese sections examines a route for possible manpower development. 31. All projections carry with them certain intrinsic hazards, especially those that attempt to look as far into the future as 2025. There are numerous uncertainties about the probable rate of economic development, about government health policies, and possible changes in the art and science of health care. Accordingly, the projections offered below must be viewed not as forecasts or plans, but simply as numerical expressions of several ways in which China's health care system, and hence manpower requirements, might evolve. In addition, the estimation of manpower requirements presupposes the availability of some way to translate a population and its needs for health care into the manpower required to meet those needs. This link between \"people\" and \"health personnel\" can be mkde via any of four different ways, viz: (1) health care needs, (2) health ca-e demands (or service utilization rates), (3) population-nanpower ratios, and (4) health service targets. Although these methods share aspects in common, each utilizes a rather different method of estimation and has its own underlying rationale and set of assumptions. (See Annex Chart 8.3). The method used here is that of the target-setting approach which, depending on the situation, may use elements of each of the other three planning methods. In making projections for China, three steps are taken: (1) certain \"reasonable\" targets are postulated for the delivery of hospital, ambulatory, and certain other services or activities based on current policies and past performance; (2) the manpower required to achieve these targets is estimated; and (3) these estimates are then contrasted with the probable manpower supply. 32. Model Assumptions -Reguirements and SUPD1V. The key assumptions -- both explicit and implicit -- used in the requirements model include the -8.12 - following:Y' a) existence of a regionalized system of health care, b) balanced urban/rural growth, c) a major emphasis on prevention, especially as regards chronic disease and injuries, d) slow improvements in hospital staffing ratios during the remainder of this century, e) substantial qualitative improvements in staff qualifications, f) a major increase in dental services, g) major improvements in hospital productivity, h) a gradual \"down-sizing\" of large hospitals and \"up-sizing\" of small hospitals, i) a gradual reduction in the number of specialized hospitals, J) an increasing emphasis on ambulatory care, k) increasing emphasis on institution- and home-based care, and on congregate care living arrangements for the convalescent, frail elderly and disabled, and 1) last, but not least, continued development of traditional Chinese medicine. The projected manpower requirements of this first iteration of the model are then compared with plausible projections of the manpower supply taking into account a) the current supply of health manpower, b) projected loss rates over time, and c) the numbers of future graduates which will enter the work force. 33. Proiected manpower requirements. One baseline and four alternative projections of possible manpower requirements to the year 2025 are s-mmarized in the table below and in the Main Report (Table 8.5). 34. Baseline groiection. This projection contrasts (1) the personnel required in 1985 to staff the nation's hospitals and to produce the observed volume of services (hospital discharges, doctor and dentist visits), with (2) the personnel that would be required to satisfy the same utilization rates in 2025. In other words, if in 1985 China had about 2.1 beds per 1000 (for a population of 1.041 billion), and produced about 40 discharges per 1000 population, and 2.2 doctor visits and 0.05 stomatologist visits per capita, what would be the staff required to produce the same resource and service indices in 2025. This baseline projection is truly baseline in that it states what China would have to do to maintain the status quo, obviously not a desirable policy. It provides a point of comparison for four alternative projections, each of which improves significantly, but in different ways, on the 1985 situation. 35. Trends groiection. This projection is based, in a very approximate way, on observed trends and policies regarding the provision of health services. While these may have some validity for a few years, they obviously cannot be used to reliably project events well into the future. Compared with 1985 estimates, short-stay hospital staffing densities are increased by 15% to 23%, discharges per 1000 by 75%, doctor visits per capita by 36%, and stomatologist visits per capita by 600%. Further details of assumptions for estimating manpower demand and supply are contained in Health Manpower, this Annex, and the tables. -8.13 - Summary Projections to 2025 of Resources, Services and Personnel Base Year Baselins Trends Hospital Ambulatory Maximsa Estiuates Projection Projection Emphasis Emphasis Projection SERVICES AND RESOURCES Hospital discharges per 1000 40 40 70 90 70 100 Average length of stay 17 17 15 14 15 14 Bad turnovers per year 19 19 21.5 24.9 23.2 24.8 X of beds in small hospitals 34 34 34 26 31 33 2 of long-stay L hoam beds 18 18 18 14 24 3234 5005 5552 4629 6195 Required beds per 1000 2.1 21 3.3 3.6 3 4 Required hospital modules 187 276 428 367 365 504 Doctor & nurse visits por capita 2.2 2.2 3 4 5 5 Doctor & nurse visits (000,OOOs) 2290 2281 4611 6148 7685 7685 Percentage of visits in hospitals 66.7 67 76 65 40 57 Stomatologist visits per capita .05 .05 .3 .4 .6 .7 Stomatologist visits (000,000s) 52 461 615 922 1076 593 1033 1851 Laboratory technicians -- 203 304 485 456 622 X-ray technicians -- 188 289 AIS 370 532 Pharmacists & asat. pharmacists -- 210 314 146 416 562 Administrators -- 339 539 699 551 825 Stomatologists & assistants -- 28 100 128 197 214 TOTALS Medical/tech, staff (00s) -- 3502 5894 8829 6608 10566 Population 1.311.7 1.5/2.1 2.012.5 1.5/2.1 2.012.9 Nurses & nurse aides per doctor -- 1.6 1.6 1.5 1.1 1.4 Source: World Bank mission estimates 36. Hospital-emphasis grojection. Compared with the trends projection, this one assumes even greater emphasis on hospital care, consistent with an aging population and the Western pattern of institution-based care for the treatment of chronic disease. This projection would use relatively larger hospital modules with greater emphasis on both large and small hospitals. Compared with 1985 estimates, short-stay hospital staffing densities are increased by about 50%, discharges per 1000 by 125%, doctor visits per capita by 81%, and stomatologist visits per capita by 800%. 37. Ambulatory-emphasis projection. This projection assumes acute care hospital indices similar to those in the trends projection but gives much emphasis to long-stay and home care and to ambulatory care. Compared with 1985 estimates, short-stay hospital staffing densities are increased by 15% to 23%, discharges per 1000 by 75%, doctor visits per capita by 272%, and stomatologist visits per capita by 1200%. A significantly greater proportion -8.14 - stomatologist visits per capita by 1200%. A significantly greater proportion of the hospital module beds are located in long-stay facilities and homes. It should be noted that although the discharges per 1000 are much less than in the hospital-emphasis projection (70 versus 90), the bed-days are only slightly lower (1.1 versus 1.2), since relatively more care is given in long- stay facilities. Since long-stay facilities require much lower staffing densities the total medical and technical workforce requirements are significantly less (6.6 versus 8.8 millions). Other things being approximately equal, ambulatory care makes relatively greater use of doctors than nurses while hospital care makes more use of nurses than doctors. Accordingly, the ambulatory emphasis projection requires about 1.1 nurses and nurse aides per doctor while for the hospital emphasis projection the ratio is 1.5 nursing staff per doctor. 38. Maximum projection. To set what might be termed an upper limit to the array of projections a \"maximum projection\" was developed based on the highest staffing densities and service targets that might seem plausible for China, assumptions that approach those found in many of the industrialized countries. Compared with 1985 estimates, short-stay hospital staffing densities are increased by 54% to 70%, discharges per 1000 by 250%, doctor visits per capita by 272%, and stomatologist visits per capita by 1400%. The total oiumber of medical and technica', personnel would exceed 10.5 million, or about three times the number that would be required according to the baseline, or \"status quo\" projection. 39. The changes implied by these projections while large in absolute numbers should be viewed in a comparative context. The \"maximum projection\" would require 10.5 million medical and technical staff, plus perhaps 4 millions in other workers not trained in the health sciences. The aggregate total of about 14.5 millions might represent about 2.4% of a conservatively estimated Chinese workforce (1.5 billion times 40% -600 millions in the workforce; the actual percentage in the workforce will probably be higher than 40%). By contrast, the United States now employs abodt 5% of its workforce in the health sector, or twice what is projected in what should be considered an inappropriately high maximum projection for China. The proportion of employment in the U.S. health sector is the product of many considerations but there is no doubt that earlier, \"care-intensive\" development of hospital infrastructure, high technology services and relative neglect of prevention programs at an earlier stage when they would have by today m-ade an impact, provides part of the explanation for the very high employment impact of health. China still has the opportunity to adjust its strategy to avoid some proportion of similar trends. Pregarina for the Future 40. China has received justifiably high praise for showing how a populous, very low income country can, in a remarkably short time, reduce death rates to nearly those now found in the industrialized world. This success was attained largely through the innovative (and rather unconventional) deployment of its human resources. The detailed manpower strategy for China to address the needs of an aging population will basically be determined by whether China initiate an effective mix of preventive strategies coupled with policies to -8.15 - ensure rationed, equitable and efficient curative services or whether it will subscribe to the predominant Western model of high technology, high cost services, and high reliance on institution-based care. Details of the strategy choices remain to be worked out but for manpower development the logical main next steps seem clear and details are included in Section G of this Chapter's Supplement. 41. For the next 15-20 years, first priority should be on improving the overall quality of undergraduate training and especially to upgrading the qualifications of existing health personnel; significant quantitative improvements should be made in selected manpower categories, most notably nursing, technical, public health and managerial personnel; hospital numbers should be reduced, average hospital size increased, aggregate hospital bed capacity gradually increased, hospital productivity improved, and staffing densities slightly improved. Major emphasis should be given to upgrading rural ambulatory services; public health resources should be increasingly shifted from communicable disease to chronic disease problems; and the statistical and institutional bases for improved planning urgently needs to be developed. This period should seek: (1) a better numerical balance between the different levels of health manpower; (2) qualitative improvements in all manpower categories, but especially at the nursing and technician levels; and (3, significant improvements in the ability to monitor the health manpower situation and to do manpower planning. 42. For the 15-20 years thereafter, renewed priority should be given to increasing the quantity of personnel so that major gains can be made in improving staffing densities; continued improvements should be made in huspital productivity and especially to the strengthening of ambulatory care throughout the system; prevention programs for chronic disease should continue to receive high priority; long term and home ._are services will need to be rapidly expanded and strengthened; continuing education and staff upgrading will have to continue to receive priority; increased attention will have to be given to achieving a balanced growth in the number of health personnel at all levels, and to determining an appropriate balance in the number of medical, nursing and technical specialists. This period would again direct primary efforts to increasing the quantity of manpower, but only once a good balance has been obtained among the various levels and the quality of the existing supply has been substantially improved. The material that follows, on Health Manpower, elaborates on a possible sequence of logical, priority manpower development steps which China will need to take as part of its health strategy. assuming it gradually moves to development of health regions as the focal point for planning and management as suggested throughout this report. -8.16 Supplement: Details of Health Manpower Development, Policies, Planning, Projections. and Future Strategy Alternatives A. Historical Perspective. 1. The first schools of western medicine in China were established late in the 19th century. Western medicine was introduced more systematically in 1917. By 1949 there were 56 medical colleges and faculties, many of them small. Some were operated by state or provincial governments and others by missionaries or foreign organizations. The courses ranged from three to eight years and the curriculum was strongly influenced by the background of the organizers. Their graduates were labelled \"doctors of western medicine\" to distinguish them from doctors of traditional medicine. The most influential of the early medical colleges was the Pek,ng Union Medical College (PUMC) established in 1924 under strong influence from the zr-44cal education reform movement then underway in the U.S. Although only 313 c. ctors graduated from PUMC in the 24 years before 1949, the graduates of this college have had a profound impact on medical education and scientific research in China and have risen to positions of leadership in the medical system. Most medical colleges were in urban areas, particularly in coastal cities, and the number of graduates averaged only 500 per year (9449 doctors graduated between 1928 and 1947). With only a few people having access to western medicine, most of the country received care from traditional practitioners who had perpetuated their art by apprenticeship for more than 2000 years. Secondary medical schools trained nurses and midwives for hospitals and for work in rural areas. It is estimated that 41,437 students graduated from these schools up to 1949. 2. After 1949 the Government of China initiated a massive program to expand and upgrade the training of health personnel, to relocate facilities in order to provide better distribution of health professionals, to give greater emphasis to prevention, and to integrate traditional medicine and western medicine. 3. By 1957 the number of independent medical colleges had increased to 37 and formal training in traditional medicine was, for the first time, provided for in separate colleges, of which five were created in 1956. The training of paramedics, assistant doctors and nurses was expanded more than fivefold in 182 secondary medical schools. With the Great Leap Forward in 1958, many new institutions were added, academic standards were relaxed, enrolment was rapidly increased, and part-time medical education was encouraged. This sudden expansion overstretched the resources of the educational institutions. Following a brief period of consolidation in the early 1960s, the system was subjected to the protracted disruption of the Cultural Revolution. The colleges were closed from 1966 to 1969, but students were permitted to graduate on schedule although they attended no classes. When the colleges reopened in 1970, the three-year courses did not go beyond the secondary medical school level, the educational process was politicized and students, often with no more than lower middle school training, were selected according to non-academic criteria. Teachers and hospital doctors were sent to the -8.17 - countryside, research was stopped and academic resources such as libraries were damaged or neglected. Almost a full generation of teachers and scientists was lost. 4. The process of rebuilding began in 1975. By 1977, the five-year program of medical studies had been reestablished in most colleges, the academic orientation was restored and students were admitted from upper middle schools primarily on the basis of academic performance. At the same time the slower process of reestablishing the scientific capability of the institutions commenced with retraining of staff, and rebuilding of the libraries, research laboratories and other academic resources. 5. Below the medical colleges are secondary medical schools. Since 1949 secondary medical schools have produced well over one million graduates. Since 1980, secondary medical school-trained assistant doctors may be promoted to senior doctors on the basis of five or more years of experience, in- service training including television courses, and by passing a qualifying examination. B. Manpower Recruitment. Steps involved in the job allocation system for new health workers. Demand: each employer sends to the local health bureau a request for specified numbers of doctors, nurses, etc.; the health bureau consolidates employer requests, makes recommendations, and forwards requests up the chain to the provincial health bureau, which forwards requests with priorities to the Provincial Educational Commission (PEC). SuDplv: High level medical colleges advise PEC of anticipated number of graduates who will be available for deployment, ie, minus those to be retained for specialization; secondary health schools advise their local education commission of anticipated graduates, which consolidates information and forwards it to the PEC. In the case of primary and middle level health workers prospective employers frequently contract with secondary health schools or other training institutions for a specified number of graduates. Students' training costs are then borne by the employer in return for a work commitment following completion of their studies. Allocation: The PEC, in consultation with the health bureau, decides how many of each type of health worker will be allocated to each employer; PEC advises medical colleges and secondary health schools of the numbers of new graduates to be assigned to each employer; educational institutions advise students of the number of positions to be filled at each employing institution; students rank their preferred jobs; educational institutions match jobs with preferences to the degree possible; students graduate in June and usually assume cheir new jobs by August 1st. 6. The experience of the Zhejiang Medical University (ZMU) in Hangzhou provides a reasonably typical example of how this allocation process works at -8.18 - year the Z-tN graduating class of about 450 divided into three groups: (1) the top 5-102 were recruited directly by ZMU to stay on either as an assistant lecturer in a basic science discipline or as a five-year resident in one of the clinical specialties; (2) the 100 next most promising graduates applied for postgraduate studies, took a competitive exam, and the best 60-70 were accepted into a three-year master of science or master of medicine degree program; and (3) the balance of the graduates ranked their job preferences and were then allocated according to the process described above. The arrangement is similar at the MOPH medical colleges and other key institutions except that a rather higher percentage usually applies for postgraduate studies. In summary then, for the graduate getting a job is no problem, though many may not get a job of their choice; and for each employer it is a matter of making a convincing case to the local health bureau that the hospital or clinic in question indeed merits making claim on the pool of new graduates 7. Retention. Additional points of detail which may be of interest to some readers include the following: a. Retention rates for most female employees apparently tend to be considerably higher than for their Western counterparts. China's demographic policies have resulted in many women having only one child, often well into their 20s, and most women apparently return to work after their four- to six-month maternity leave. This general situation notwithstanding, significant numbers of middle level staff such as nurses reportedly leave their demanding yet low paying jobs as soon as an opportunity comes along. Typical reasons cited for such losses were: change in husband's living or job circumstances; found a better job outside of the health sector; or arranged with employer to transfer within the hospital to another job, such as that of 'technician\" or administrator, which pays about the same as nursing but is less demanding. S. Remuneration. The 1987 basic salary scale for health personnel, according to title and level, provided each of six personnel levels a basic salary of V40 per month, to which is added an additional amount according to eight different seniority steps. The range for these personnel categories in the Beijing region is as follows: Category Bottom Y Top Y Spread Chief doctor 160 355 2.2x Associate chief doctor 122 235 l.9x Attending doctor 97 170 1.8x Resident doctor 70 122 1.7x Chief nurse 70 122 1.7x Nurse & asst. doctor 52 97 1.9x Nurse aide NA NA NA These amounts are increased significantly by several additional sources of income and other benefits: -8.19 - a. Salary supplement, which is the sum of several fixed subsidies paid to all eligible employees, and which averages out to about one-third (Y44-45) of an average take home salary of '150. These subsidies ire to \"compensate\" for such expenses as food (V22 average), reading material ('5), personal hygiene (Y8), health hazard supplement (Y7), and transport if the employee lives more that a specified distance from his place of work ('2-3). Nurses are also eligible for an additional supplement -- designed to keep nurses in nursing -- after 10 years of nursing service; this supplement increases with additional years of employment. Since all these supplements are for fixed amounts and not linked to salaries, they serve to reduce salary differentials. b. Salary bonus, which averages about '20-25 (1987) in hospitals or about 25Z of an average base salary, and is distributed to all employees in the specified production unit (ward, lab, hospital, etc.) in approximate proportion to their respective salaries. The central government has set the maximum annual bonus to be about 1.5 months' salary, beyond which the institution is heavily taxed on its bonus payments. Recent policies suggest that this upper limit may be increased two- to threefold to provide additional employee incentives for improved performance. The bonus portion is likely to increase relatively faster than base salaries in the future. c. Secondary employment income, which may be earned by health education faculty and by physicians and nurses for spare time work in teaching or clinical care for another institution. An estimated 102 of urban health workers, especially at the higher levels, earn supplementary income which, for the majority, will add approximately 50Z to their regular take home pay. This practice of second incomes is likely to increase due to government policy which encourages the 'intellectual\" professions to improve their living standards while at the same time contributing their expertise to meeting societal needs. d. Vacation leave, which now amounts to seven national holidays available to everyone, plus 10 to 20 days per year of paid leare, depending on seniority. University faculty receive the same holidays (2.5-3 months) as do students. e. Pensions. Besides the above direct remuneration and benefits, salaried health workers are entitled to receive a pension on retirement at 55 years for women and 60 for men. Pensions are normally paid at the rate of 702 to 10OZ of the base salary, depending on years in service, plus 1002 of the supplemental salary. Pensions are paid by the employer when they come due and no pension credits or charges are made to individual employee accounts during the time of service. 9. No statistical data are available by which to assess trends with regard to salary differentials (1) within a given health occupation category, (2) -8.20 - between different health occupation categories (eg, doctor, nurse), or (3) between health salaries and those found in other comparable sectors. Based on informal information provided by the MOPH however, salary levels and differentials appear to have remained fixed for many years up through the Cultural Revolution. In the early years since that time there had been a number of adjustments which raised salaries significantly but without affecting relative relationships very much. Since then health sector salaries seem to be gradually falling behind those provided in the manufacturing, commercial, and other rapidly developing sectors, particularly within the last three years. C. ManRwoer Production. 10. Details of Ouantitative AsRects. National data were not available on applicant-to-entrant ratios or on the \"quality\" of applicants to the respeczive careers. Although anecdotal evidence suggests that medical college entrants are now tending to give health careers a lower ranking when they take the national university entrance examination than they did in the past (presumably due to a wider variety of attractive careers in other fields such as engineering, business services, trade, etc.), most informants anticipate no shortage of qualified applicants in any of the main health-related careers, almost irrespective of the rate of increase in intake. For most health occupational careers at the secondary health school level or above, students typically take an entrance examination and list in rank order their career preferences. Although such major careers as nursing are often ranked low by applicants, students reportedly are so glad to have assured professional training that they accept entrance and remain in their studies program, as evidenced by low intra-school attrition rates. As was pointed out by one senior nursing official, \"Although nurses may get low pay, low status, long hours and a difficult job, the career is still much to be preferred over continued work on a farm.\" 11. Details of Qualitative Aspects. The 1978 curricula specify the minimum number of class hours to be given in each of the required course topics. Although these norms do not appear to be vigorously enforced, they have acted to restrain educational innovation. By setting a minimum number of hours in a large number of topics which must be accommodated in a short four- or five- year program, most colleges apparently have difficulty building in adequate elective time, accommodating new subjects, or trying new ways of combining related topics in order to improve educational efficiency. 12. There is ample evidence that despite some exemplary individual efforts at change, China's health science curriculum is in urgent need of the kind of reform that is being proposed by the State Education Commission. The problems include: a. excessive academic pressure and tendency towards conformity, which derives from the national university entrance exams; b. rigid, outdated curricula; inadequate elective time; c. excessive emphasis on memorization, \"passive\" learning; -8.21 - d. lack of facilities and equipment to promote active learning; e. undue emphasis on large lectures; f. limited resources for conducting educational research; and g. few innovations, inadequately evaluated 13. While the national norms still call for ample hours concerned with parasitic and communicable disease, there is relatively little emphasis on chronic disease, even though the three major causes of mortality now account for about two-thirds of all deaths and a high proportion of morbidity and disability. Strong emphasis is given to the biological aspects of medicine while little time is allocated to the social or psychological aspects of medicine (e.g., no time for psychology and only 36 hours for psychiatry); and virtually no time is given to such topics as public health, clinical epidemiology, health management, health economics, and nutrition. 14. The recent proposal for curriculum reform may lead to major and much needed changes in the health education system. After receiving many complaints about the outdated curricula norms, the State Education Commission (SEdC) convened a conference in November 1987 of medical college representatives to update -.he 1978 curricula. The new norms, have been circulated for review and tomment, and call for major changes: a. suggested ranges of hours for each topic are now proposed rather than a specified number of hours; b. the new curricula seek to utilize international experience and to reflect better the relative importance of the several subjects to be taught; C. electives are to account for 10-15% of the curricula, and suggested course offerings include such topics as sociology, psychology, and social medicine; and d. schools may shift from the semester to the quarter system in order to allow greater flexibility in offering electives. D. Manpower Planning. 15. Several recent planning efforts with manpower components can help illustrate how the demand and supply side agencies have approached manpower planning. a. Seventh Five-Year Plan. National manpower targets for the five- year period ending in 1990 serve to illustrate both the methods and limitations of current manpower planning. The hospital bed and manpower targets were derived as follows: -8.22 - i. in preparation for the plan the MOPH proposed three alternative ratios of beds per 1000 population, ie, 2.5:1, 3.0:1, and 3.5:1; ii. each ratio was then converted into manpower requirements by means of the 1978 revision of the national hospital staffing standards, described in a later section; iii. the national government \"accepted,' apparently without much review, the lowest alternative; and iv. the resulting target was set at 770,000 'medical staff\" (including nurses, technicians, etc., and not just doctors), to satisfy the desired rate of hospital expansion. 16. While the above manpowqer target may be 'reasonable,\" it cannot be argued to have been the result of a careful assessment of needs and capabilities, nor has it been backed up with explicit implementation machinery to assure its achievement. The various elements of the Seventh Five-Year plan of particular relevance to manpowrer are: a. The -pressed intention to increase hospital beds by 400,000 (as of early 1988 China is apparently well behind the annual target required by this objective), to rebuild or expand 16 'key\" hospitals, and to increase by 70,000-80,000 the number of beds for traditional Chinese medic!ine (the country is apparently near target on this objective); b. continued efforts to integrate traditional Chinese medicine and Western medicine; c. the plan to increase health personnel by 770,000, or by more than 150,000 per year over the five-year period; d. various measures designed to improve hospital management, to strengthen rural and county-level health services, and to strengthen teaching and research institutions; and e. the plan to upgrade 75Z of all rural doctors to where they have the equivalent of a secondary medical school training. E. Manpower Plans for the Year 2000. 17. The draft SEdC plan to train high level medical personnel provides another example of the approach now used in China. Starting in 1987 the steps were as follows: a. according to the central government's target of a 'modest comfortable living standard' by the year 2000, the MOPH set as an approximate healt'- goal an aggregate total of one high level medical doctor (Western and TCM combined) per 1000 population. Besides the MOPH, tnis target was also accepted by the State TCM -8.23 - Administration, the SEdC, and the State Drug and Medical Instrument Administration; b. the SEdC then estimated the number of new such personnel needed between 1987 and 2000 to meet this goal. Based on the current estimated age structure of high level manpower, an assumed retirement age of 60, and an estimated annual loss rate of 3Z-5Z, the SEdC estimates that 820,000 additional personnel must be trained, which would require an annual average increase in high level entering enrollments from about 40,000 to 60,000 starting in 1987; c. the SEdC next reviewed options for increasing the supply and decided to recommend: (1) holding the current number (about 130) of high level medical colleges approximately constant; (2) remodeling and expanding the 38 \"older\" (pre-1950s) medical colleges, with the first phase to be completed by 1995; (3) a major expansion in the number of three-year 'associate doctor\" medical colleges, and in their entering enrollments; and (4) that the five-year colleges be given enough supplementary support to allow them to help the new and expanding associate doctor colleges cover their additional teaching loads. (The 'associate doctor\" colleges accept students after 12 years of gen6ral education, unlike the secondary health schools which train assistant doctors in three years after nine years of general education.) With its plan for t'!e 38 older medical colleges completed in 1987, the SEdC is now working on the details of how the three-year associate doctor program would be expanded; 18. The net effects of this overall plan for the year 2000 would be to double the enrolment of the 38 older medical colleges, increase by at least 5000 the entering enrolment of the associate doctor colleges, and increase the total enrolment of doctors, TCM doctors, three-year associate doctors, pharmacists, and stomatologists combined from about 40,000 to 60,000 by 1995. The natic..Lal government cost would be about Y1.2 billion for the entire period, with most of this amount to be allocated primarily for remodeling and expanding the 38 medical colleges. The cost of the associate doctor programs is assumed to be borne primarily at the provincial level and below. 19. The SEdC has reported this plan to the State Council (Cabinet) with the endorsement of the MOPH and other major health bodies, and is optimistic regarding its eventual approval although the target dates may be extended somewhat due to budgetary pressures. 20. These brief descriptions undoubtedly do not do justice to the considerable amount of work that has gone into health manpower planning in recent years. They do serve, however, to suggest both the strengths and limitations of what is now done. The strengths include: government involvement and direction at the highest level; simple, pragmatic targets; and considerable ingenuity in the case of the Year 2000 SEdC proposal such that implementation would maximize utilization of existing resources and would build on the strengths of the current three-year 'associate\" program. -8.24 - 21. The plan approaches also have conspicuous limitations. The targets bear little relation to larger health objectives; health manpower requirements seem unduly linked to hospital planning; the bed and doctor ratio objectives have apparently not led planners to develop sub-targets of service activities, service capacity, other personnel, or the attainment of distributional or productivity objectives; and operating costs have not been estimated to see if the overall targets are financially realistic. F. Projection Model Detail. 22. The next sections describe the main features of the projection model used to estimate manpower requirements. Important limitations on projecting manpower requirements include problems with data since these cannot now be disaggregated by: Province or sub-provincial level, though it should be noted that two provincial workforce studies are now in progress and their data will be used-both for purposes of developing requirements in these provinces as well as to improve the realism of the national estimates. SRecific occupational category, since many of the occupational categories, e.g., Western doctor, nurse, technician, include persons with differing levels of general schooling, of professional education, and of post-basic specialty training. This limitation is especially notable with regard to distribution of the various medical specialties, e.g., medicine, surgery, pediatrics, ophthalmology, which are in turn closely correlated with the predominant morbidity patterns. One very rough approach to determining a desirable distribution by broad specialty categories is described later on. TvDe of activity or services prGvided. This is perhaps one of the most serious limitations, since it would be very desirable to make independent estimates of staff requirements to provide inpatient care, ambulatory care, diagnostic supporting services, administrative services, and teaching. Unfortunately, it was not possible to disaggregate the current manpower supply by major activity, nor, more importantly, was it possible to obtain staffing standards for anything other than entire institutions. Rough approximations to compensate for this problem are described. Ty2e of employer. Different employers, (MOPH, enterprises, the armed forces) have different health facility staffing levels. Supply data are not, however, sufficiently disaggregated to allow one to estimate, independently, the staff that would be required for each different employer category. Even with these limitations, the proposed requirements model can provide useful guidance. Moreover, as additional information becomes available and staffing standards are developed for specific activities, these can be readily incorporated in the model to allow policy makers to test the manpower implications of a'ternative policies and targets regarding the delivery of services. -8.25 - 23. Requirements model assumptions. The key assumptions -- both explicit and implicit -- used in the requirements model include the following: a. Existence of a regionalized system of health care as is described more completely in Chapter 6 In such a system most regions would have a catchment population of perhaps two to five millions. though some regions might serve as few as a million and others might serve an entire metropolitan area of up to ten millions or more. b. Balanced urban/rural growth, in '4.ich the observed urban-rural gap in the delivery of services is not allowed to increase over the short run and that as the transportation network improves, especially in the early 21st Century, the gap is progressively reduced. This assumption implies continued heavy reliance on primary and middle-level medical personnel, especially in rural areas, while preserving arrangements to make it possible for such personnel to upgrade their qualifications over time. c. Major emphasis on prevention, especially as regards chronic disease and injuries. It is assumed that existing programs for the prevention of communicable disease and for the improvement of water supplies are continued. To cope with the massive problems of poor oral health and the extreme shortage of dental personnel, fluoridation of urban water supplies should proceed as rapidly as possible. d. Slow but significant quantitative improvements in hospital staffing ratios (or densities) during the remainder of this century; substantial qualitative improvements, or upgrading of staff qualifications; a major increase in dental services. e. Major improvements in hospital productivity gained through preferential increases in nursing and technician staff densities, improved diagnostic services, and improved management. The increasing cost per bed-day should be more than matched by shortened length of hospitalization, increased bed turnovers, and a reduced need to mset the rising demand for hospital care through new construction. f. A gradual \"down-sizing\" of large hospitals and \"up-sizing\" of small hospitals such that most hospitals are eventually in the range of 200 to 600 beds. This reflects the emerging international consensus that above approximately 600 beds nothing is gained in hospital efficiency and geographic accessibility is reduced (because larger hospitals serve correspondingly larger catchment areas), and that modern hospitals below about 200 beds tend to be inefficient and cannot readily justify the variety of equipment and services that have come to be expected. Obviously, sparsely populated regions may require hospitals with substantially fewer than 200 beds, especially during the next few -8.26 - decades while transportation is still difficult, but except for these special situations it is assumed that smaller hospitals will be gradually phased out or converted to other uses such as convalescent care. g. A gradual reduction in the number of specialized hospitals, with most of these functions being taken over by general hospitals. In the projection model specialized (maternity, pediatric, cancer, etc.) hospitals are assumed, on average, to have similar staffing densities as do general hospitals of comparable size, though in reality some (e.g., cancer hospitals) will have higher densities and others (e.g., tuberculosis hospitals) will have lower ones. h. An increasing emphasis on ambulatory care, facilitated by improved transportation systems. At the present time most ambulatory care is provided either by hospital-based clinics or by free standing, satellite clinics which operate under hospital authority. The projection models assume that hospitals will continue to produce about 2.5 ambulatory visits per available bed-day in future years as was estimated to be the case in 1985, and that additional visits to satisfy the several targets will be provided by clinics or in private physician offices that are independent of hospitals. i. Increasing emphasis on institution- and home-based care, and on congregate care living arrangements for the convalescent, frail elderly and disabled. Much of the institution-based care could be provided through the conversion and use of existing small hospitals or larger ones that are no longer suitable for general hospital use. J. Continued developmer-t of traditional Chinese medicine such that TCM beds continue to maintain their current proportion to the total bed supply. In the absence of separate TCM and Western hospital staffing norms or of policy statements regarding the desired balance between TCM and Western hospital beds, the requirements projections assume the same staffing densities for hospitals of comparable size in the two health care systems. While this may result in underestimates of certain categories of personnel (e.g., pharmacists) in TCM hospitals and overestimates in other categories (e.g., technicians), the distortions should be small. Further refinements in the projection model can easily take into account system-specific (TCM, Western) norms. 24. Estimating supply. In broad terms, the supply projections are based on the following data and assumptions: a. The current supply of health manpower, for which a plausible age or cohort distribution has been assumed in the absence of any complete time series on the actual number of graduates in each category over time. -8.27 - b. A proiected loss rate over time which assumes a relatively higher rate for women than men; that all women cease working after about age 60; and that all men cease work after age 65. No age-, sex- or occupation-specific attrition rates are now available. The nominal retirement age is 55 and 60 for the two sexes, respectively, but some persons continue part-time employment after reaching retirement age, especially in the high level professions, and it is assumed that this proportion will gradually increase over time as life expectancy and health levels improve, and as the reality of a rising dependency ratio encourages government to continue employment beyond the 55/60 levels that now prevail. c. Future graduates are estimated based on (1) the current annual intake of new students, minus a small intra-school attrition, plus (2) an annual increment in medical college enrollments which would attain the stated objective of one high level doctor per 1000 population by around 2000, plus (3) a strong rate of growth for secondary health school graduates, followed by (4) a more moderate rate of growth thereafter. Specific assumptions are detailed in the supply projection tables. Once this baseline projection has been developed then one can proceed to modify the supply assumptions to bring them into accord with the projected requirements. 25. Additional Details. Several additional assumptions or terms require comment in order to understand the requirements projections. a. Projection model. The model used in these projections is on a micro-computer (PC) and all input assumptions can be easily modified to test the implications of alternative policies. It can be readily modified to project to any year, for any size population, eg, a metropolitar. area or a province, and the various services (doctor visits, hospital discharges, etc.) can be further disaggregated as soon as Chinese data and norms will permit such disaggregation. b. Hospital module. A \"hospital module\" combines in one unit a number of hospitals varying in both size and type. In the five projections used hpre the modules include from 42 to 49 hospitals and long-stay facilities, with a combined total of 11,700 to 15,150 beds, enough to meet the hospital needs of 3-4 million population, depending on the bed-population ratio used. A population of this size is large enough to justify tertiary care facilities and a full range of health services, but small enough to be administered as a single region, though this assumption is not essential. Whether China is admiinistratively divided into regions, as discussed in Chapter 6, is not relevant to the use of hospital modules to facilitate planning. Moreover, it should be emphasized that for reasons of geography, demography, and social, economic and administrative considerations, hospital regions will vary widely in size from the waverage' region that is here postulated. In addition to hospital services, the staff allocated to each module is assumed to produce a large number of ambulatory medical, nursing and dental services, and to provide a wide variety of public health services. c. Long-stay facilities and hime care beds. China provides a variety of extended care services to persons not requiring hospitalization. For lack of either staffing norms or accurate facility statistics a single hospital category termed \"long stay\" is used. In most cases this assumes a facility averaging about 100 beds, that: has low staffing densities (around 40 staff of all types per 100 beds); has long stays (25-35 days); that provides institutional care to convalescent or disabled persons; and that typically has an associated clinic or home visit service that provides about one doctor visit per bed per day. In addition to long-stay beds the category of \"home beds, is included with an assumed average length of stay under supervised care of about 20 days. Staffing ratios are designed to provide about one home visit by either a doctor or nurse every third day plus minimal backup services from pharmacists, technicians and other personnel. With improvements in the data base these assumptions can be brought more closely in line with actual experience. d. Staffing norms. The staffing norms or densities used in the model represent its greatest limitation. As noted earlier, they were first developed in the 1950s based on Soviet experience, they were last updated in 1978, most hospitals have not yet attained the recommended staffing densities, and the Mission did not have available to it the proposed norms. Moreover, although larger hospitals have more staff per bed than smaller hospitals, all hospitals regardless of size are apparently assumed by Chinese authorities to have the same proportions of doctors (25Z), nurses (50t), technicians, etc., an unrealistic assumption. In the absence of forward looking norms which take into account hospital size there were two choices: (1) use staffing norms from selected hospitals from another, more industrialized country, or (2) use the 1978 standards, with \"reasonable\" upwards adjustments but without reference to any other non-Chinese institutions. Given the very long-range nature of the projections and the ease of modifying them as better Chinese data become available, the latter approach was taken. Accordingly, the several projections are useful only to illustrate approximately how fast, and in what directions the health workforce would have to grow to satisfy the stated targets. e. Stomatologist visits. In the absence of virtually any information on the supply and productivity of oral health personnel or on the utilization of their services, assumptions about future developments are especially hazardous. Industrialized countries typically provide 1.5+ visits per capita and have one dentist per 2-5,000 population. China now has about one stomatologist per 100,000 population, which might result :n about 0.05 visits per capita, assuming about 5000 visits per year per full-time equivalent stomatologist. However, if stomatologists spend much of their time in head and neck surgery the number of visits could be a lot lower, or if they spend a lot of their time on tooth extractions, it could be higher. The 2025 projected per capita utilization represents what appears to be a feasible target if people increasingly seek oral health care and if government at least partially subsidizes such care. The need for much greater oral health care is clearly there; the main uncertainties are the degree to which people value oral health and can afford the services. As a final point, although the projections are in terms of Istomatologist visits\", the assumptions are that (1) these services will be provided both by fully qualified stomatologists and by assistant stomatologists, perhaps in large part in schcol settings, (2) and that the stomatologists will spend full- or almost full-time on care of the teeth, ie, they will not spend significant time on head and neck surgery. The assumptions of six hours per day and four patients per hour are consistent with some time being spent in non-clinical activities and with a fairly high hourly productivity compared to dentists in high income countries, in which a high proportion of the patients require longer visits. f. Rural/urban care. There is no firm basis as yet for the development of separate models for the delivery of urban and rural care, though this would be very desirable. The postulated hospital module assumes that o-er time many of the village and smaller district health facilities will close their hospital beds or convert them to long-stay beds, and that the smaller hospitals, averaging 200 beds each, will upgrade their capabilities substantially and be distributed so ae to serve primarily rural populations. The problem of ambulatory care is more complicated. The projection model makes several assumptions to capture in a very approximate way a much more complex reality: that all hospitals ,-oduce from 2.1 to 2.3 doctor visit. per bed per day, depending on hospital size; that by 2025 China will increase from about 2.2 doctor visits (including all types and levels of \"doctors\") per capita as estimated for 1985 to as high as 5.0 visits per capita; that 202 of the visits produced apart from the hospital system will be provided by doctors in urban settings, and 802 by doctors (usually of the 'village doctor\" level) in rural settings; and that a significant portion of the ndoctor\" visits will in fact be provided by specially qualified nurses or midwives. Separate staffing and productivity assumptions, which could not be based on actual Chinese experience or norms, are listed for urban and rural ambulatory services produced outside of the hospital system. For dental visits provided outside of a hospital-based clinic setting, the assumption is that half will be provided in the urban sector and half in the rural sector which, since there are many more rural than urban residents, would mean that urban residents will get relatively more dental care. g. Public health, research and administrative personnel. No empirical data or norms exist as a basis for estimating -8... - requirements for these types of activities. Assumptions used for projections are the same for all the projections except the ambulatory emphasis, for which significantly higher figures are assumed. While these various estimates appear \"reasonable\", time may prove them far from the mark. Al.though their numerical impact is relatively small it will be important to develop better estimates in the future because of the specialized training required by those in such fields as administration, epidemiology, health education, research and statistics. The substantial number of technicians assumed for the national and provincial levels acknowledges the increasing roles these institutions will play in research, and in the testing, monitoring and control of diagnostic and therapeutic agents and procedures. 26. Proiected requirements for medical and surgical specialists. No norms or estimates were available that could be used to suggest the approximate distribution of doctors according to area of specialization. Although specialist estimates are especially difficult to make and are frequently shown by subsequent experience to be wrong, some work on this problem could be worthwhile. Without any guidance, however rudimentary, about the relative proportions of specialists desired, and with more and more decisions decentralized to 'he hospital level, China could find the distribution of specialists responding more to the relative attractiveness of the specialties than to the needs of the country. This has clearly happened in the West such that in many health care systems surgeons are over-rapresented and many medical specialties and public health are under-reprtsented. Since doctors tend to treat their patients and order equipment that responds to their specialty expertise, specialty distortions can have a very significant distorting effect on the health system as a whole. 27. Proiected Manpower Supplv. Several cautions are especially relevant to these projections. Specifically: a. The starting point for both sets of p-ojections is the estimated current supply of manpower in 1985. Ihese estimates are, in most cases, very approximate since as has been noted previously, little information is available about the private sector and most of the manpower categories suffer from overlapping or uncertain definitions. Accordingly, the current supply estimates may well be off by 20% or more. b. Assumed rates of production are also subject to substantial errors due to data limitations regarding total current outputs and/or specialty specific outputs, e.g., stomatologists, lab and x-ray technicians. For some manpower categories all new personnel may be obtained from the educational institutions but for most categories training program \"output\" will also be the result of continuing education and upgrading programs. In other words, a five-year cohort production of, say, 50,000 \"graduates\" may represent 30,000 persons who complete formal studies and then enter the health sector workforce for the first time, plus an -8..I - additional 20,000 persons who are already employed in the health sector and who hare been \"upgraded\" through in-service programs. c. Both projections use the same rates of retention, and these have intentionally been assumed to be at the high end of what might be considered reasonable. Sirce the ritention rates have a powerful effect on the projections it is probable that the projected suppZ.y is more apt to be on the high side of reality. d. Both projections combine Western with TCM doctors, and assistant Western with assistant TCM doctors. The two categories of doctors and assistant doctors have similar training programs with regard to entrance requirements and duration, and their duties are comparable. As Chinese authorities define the relative balance betweer the Western and TCM systems, it will be easy to adjust the requirements and supply models accordingly to determine training requirements. For the same reasons, supply projections of the several technician categories are combined as are those for nurses and nurse aides. Since training requirements are quite different, however, it will be important to disaggregate the estimates as soon as practicable. e. The supply projections assume major qualitative imgrovements in the training programs and hence the presumed effect of the expanded manpower supply should be far greater than is reflected by the increased numbers alone. G. An Indicative List of Logical Steps to be Taken in Develo-ment of Health Manvower. 28. Health system organization will do much to determine ics manpower requirements. Along with the expected benefits of a more decentralized system with greater institutional autonomy may come the risks of institutional fragmentation and, because of the characteristics of the Chinese reimbursement system, greater emphasis on hospitalization and high technology medicine. The following approach may lessen this risk. 29. By the mid-1990s, design, field test in selected locations, and gradually implement a regionalized system of health care. China has the major elements of a regionalized system already in place. However, the effectiveness of this system for patient care, quality assurance, and manpower development could be significantly enhanced by implementing policies of the kind outlined in the Hospital Management Sections of this report. For manpower the key requirements are two: (1) that there be a strong regional training network, headed by a medical college, that carries out or supports all aspects of the training function, including evaluative research; (2) that explicit arrangements be made within the regionalized health care system for staff training, supervision, rotation and deployment. Typically this would call for higher level institutions to assume specific responsibilities with regard to lower level institutions with which they are functionally linked. 30. Secondly, a major emphasis should be placed on ambulatory care. Low income countries typically find themselves in caught in the cycle in which poor ambulatory services lead to delayed care, then to hospitalization, adding to crowded hospitals which then results in pressure to expand hospital capacity, which then culminates in even less money for ambulatory care services. China still has an opportunity to avoid this s'tuation. At least three people can be cared for in the clinic for the cost of one day of hospitalization, or about 45 people for the cost of one patient hospitalized for an average of 15 days. Priority should be given to expanding clinic capacity, to developing \"satellite\" clinics that achieve a good geographic dispersion, and to creating a strong linkage between these clinics and the hospital-based diagnostic services and consultant services that can maximize their effectiveness. Average hospital size should increase, hospital patients should be expected to become sicker (reflecting improved clinic services which keep patients out of hospitals until they are, on the average, sicker), and improved coordination between clinics and diagnostic services should help reduce the average length of hospital stay despite a sicker patient population. 31. By around 2000, design, field test, evaluate, and progressively implement convalescent and home care services. As the population ages and chronic disease prevalence increases, many people are going to need a level of care intermediate between that of a clinic and a fully staffed hospital. These patients are now either occupying a hospital bed, or are receiving very limited services in \"temporary beds\" or \"home beds'. Chinese hospitals have started developing innovative approaches to this problem, though without adequate budgetary support or the benefit of a careful assessment of the options open to them. Dur. tg the next 15 years careful studies should be made to develap a Chinese solution to this problem and to develop suggested guidelines for the approximate relative emphasis to put into such services as hospital motels (for ambulatory patients and accompanying relatives who are from out of town), convalesc_nt beds for recovery, rehabilitation and for the frail elderly who cannot live at home, and for home care beds. If only 1% of the 65+ population in 2025 were to require institutionalized care, and not including provision for anyone under 65, more than 2 million extended care beds would be necessary. Ouantitative aspects 32. During 1990-1999, China should give highest priority to expanding nurse, assistant and associate doctor. public health. health manager and stomatologist training. Concurrently, special efforts should be made to prepare future teachers in these professions so that further training program expansion can take place in succeeding decades. All primary and middle-level training programs should be designed so as to facilitate eventual upgrading or retraining, and an increasing portion of the training time should be allocated to the problems of aging and to the prevention, treatment and care of chronic disease. By the end of the century a significant portion of the output of associate doctors should be made towards providing care for the elderly. By 2000-2010, priority should probably be shifted to expanding technician training and strengthening high level doctor training. 33. To achieve expansion, enrolment increases should be attained, in declining order of priority, by: 1) admitting additional students to existing institutions; 2) upgrading and expanding existing schools, especially those with the most antiquated facilities; 3) opening new schools in areas not now served; and 4) opening new schools in areas already served. Serious consideration should also be given wherever possibla to (1) using double teaching shifts to optimize utilization of scarce resources, and (2) through the use of grants and contracts, to encouraging existing educational institutions to open branch (or satellite) part- or full-time training programs in their geographic areas. The proposed State Education Commission's plan for atta4ning a 1:1000 doctor:population ratio is consistent with the above suggestions. 34. Qualitative aspects of strategy will include measures which seek to define better the health workforce and what is expected of it, to increase skill levels in all occupational categories, and to improve the health system's ability to monitor performance. The key prerequisites to making progress in these areas will be educational system stability, policy continuity, and a supportive leadership that makes educational reform not only possible, but essential. Specific, phased, logical developments would appear to be those listed below. Rather than being implemented simultaneously, however, they would be phased in according to considerations of priority and as the effectiveness of previous reforms become zpparent. a. Expansion of high level degree programs in selected public health disciplines and in nursing education -- Highest priority specialties would include epidemiology, biostatistics, health administration, planning and policy, and health services research and evaluation. Provision should also be made for increasing the number of overseas study opportunities in these fields. b. Implementation of a standardized terminology for career classification (defined as those jobs that will ultimately require at least three months of full-time equivalent specialized training); develop a standardized terminology for post-basic medical specialization, ie, defining surgeons, internists, etc., not only by what they do but also by the skills that they should possess. c. Adopt minimum entry level requirements for all major careers; reduce total number of categories and levels; ensure that career ladders exist so that there are no dead-end jobs no matter how low the previous qualifications; by 2000, consider eliminating any health-specific career jobs which accept applicants with less than nine years of general education d. Update all national model training curricula for each of the health careers (used for reference and guidance only, and not as requirements); encourage training program experimentation and evaluation; review and revise model curricula at least every five years. 8.__ e. Update indicative estimates of the probable requirements for specialists in high level careers, especially in medicine and nursing. At present China has no data on distributions of high level manpower. The potential for distortions in the training of specialists, and in the consequent delivery of care, is substantial. To reduce these problems a national level body should develop and periodically update estimates of the probable supply of and demand for the major specialist categories for the guidance of training institutions. f. Disseminate desired performance standards for major careers, i.e. what should a new nurse, technician, doctor, pharmacist, etc., be able to do. \"Performance\", or \"outcome\" standards place emphasis not on the knowledge that a graduate should possess (and recall at the time of examination), but rather on the skills he should have. Typical outcomes for various occupations might include: draw a blood sample; do a white blood cell count; perform a lumbar puncture; diagnose and treat lobar pneumonia; clean and suture a laceration; diagnose and set a collarbone fracture. The standards for any one occupational category would seek to define the broad areas of expertise necessary, define the lower and upper boundaries of skills to be attained within each area, and give emphasis to achieving a desired outcome, rather than on the acquisition of knowledge alone. The World Health Organization has done much work in this area. g. Extend and strengthen the continuing education system. The ke, elements of this would include: specification of which careers are to receive priority and in what sequence; identification of lead institutions in each region to implement CE programs; suggested topics to cover and desired levels of achievement; suggested arrangements and balance of effort between the different modalities of CE; suggested arrangements for testing and certifying trainee proficiency; and the estimated cost and financial arrangements for plan implementation. h. Establish a system for auditing the quality of ambulatory and inpatient care. Information should include infection rates, complication rates, appropriateness of therapies, procedures and tests used, appropriateness of length of stay, etc. Data of the sort proposed can be extremely valuable for monitoring quality and general institutional performance, but it can also be costly to collect and analyze. For this reason it is proposed that China proceed cautiously and carefully in this area, with national application of a medical audit system, preceded by some years of field testing in a limited number of locations. i. Implement in stages a national system for health personnel credentialling. Possible elements of such a system could include inspection and accreditation of training programs, national licensure examinations, certification, and periodic registration. At the present time high le-el personnel obtain permanent -8.35 - authorization to practice in any location in China by virtue of their original degree while lower level personnel are usually allowed to practice only in their local geographic area, thus furtFer discouraging job mobility and a national health manpower market. For all levels of health personnel there is no system for verifying or certifying continued proficiency, nor for establishing with any rigor who may call themselves by what occupational title. This lack of a \"credentialling system\" was, and probably still is, appropriate for China at its current level of health system development; it will increasingly become a liability in the future as China seeks to improve the quality of care and its ability to plan to meet its manpower needs. Accordingly, within some 15-20 years China should plan to introduce the basic elements of a credentialling system which would provide a good base on which to build in further improvements during the succeeding 20 years. -8.36 - Anrex Chart 8.1 levels of Health Workers Position Education and Training Tyeical role. commenta First-leve Health Workers Barefoot Highly variable; primary Formerly a part-time (30- doctor (BFD) education or more, plus 306 50%) health worker -farmer months of locally designed selected by community who health-related training plus received workpoint income continuing education; from his work rendering principal instruction manual curative (>50% of health- (1970) devoted 45% to herbs, related time) and 40% to Dx and Rx of common preventive services in the diseases, Ob, Gyn, Peds, 10% brigade health station; on therapeutic techniques, 3% role has been, at least in on Dx techniques, 2% on part, assumed by 'village sanitation, PH and birth doctor'; since 1980 policy contol. has been to upgrade BFD's skills; BFD term is no longer used.

This methods begins with a detailed examination of morbidity, estimates the amount of manpower time required to cope with each diagnostic category, and then translates this in the numbers of doctors, nurses, etc., that are required. This method is clearly the most logical approach but for various practical reasons (e.g., lack of data, lack of standards, country inatility to provide the requisite manpower), it has seldom been used and is not now appropriate for China. Health Care Demands. This method begins with estimates of the population- specific utilization rates, e.g., hospital-days, visits of various types used by the population according to such variables as sex, residence, education, income, and insurance coverage. Changes in the various population groups are then project forward and the observed utilization rates are applied to the future population. This method would not be possible in China due to the lack of utilization data and would not be appropriate for various reasons such as the nature of the health system and prevailing health policies. PoRulation-Mfnpower Ratios. This method projects requirements using desired ratios of doctors, nurses, etc., to population. The ratios are usually based on those observed in countries, regions, or communities, deemed to have 'good' staffing patterns. While this method is easy and frequently used, it does not readily allow planners to explore the effects of different patterns of manpower utilization, e.g., ambulatory care, hospital care, or to ensure that sufficient manpower are available for all the major areas of responsibility, e.g., teaching, administration. Target-Setting ADproach.

A simplified version of this methods has been used for projecting China's requirements in this report. -8.42 - Annex Table 8.1 NUMBER OF DOCTORS AND HOSPITAL BEDS BY MEDICAL AREA 1985 r Category I Doctors I % B Beds ._.

China has received wide international recognition over the last several decades for its success in providing health services and disease prevention programs which are effective and low in cost, both to the consumer and to the economy. In part this was attributable to low factor costs. However, part of the foundation for its cost effective approach was the mobilization of cooperative and community contributions, particularly to undertake activities not directly related to health care!/ but still fundamental for reduction of epidemics, infections, infant and maternal mortality. More importantly, priority in funding, manpower and political attention was given to disease prevention/health promotion as fundamental strategy elements. 2. While success in prevention of mortality and morbidity from communicable disease has been largely successful, relatively smaller gains have been made in recent years, and then mainly in urban areas. In many rural areas tuberculosis, dysentery, pneumonia, and, in specific locales, schistosomiasis are still at levels which do not reflect China's best performance. In some areas rates of infectious disease are even increasing moderately and the sexually transmitted diseases, which had been virtually eradicated, are reappearing. At the same time prevention of illness and death from chronic disease has been largely neglected. There has been increased spending for higher level hospitals and for expensive new equipment for diagnosis and treatment of the chronic diseases. However, because of the nature of these diseases there has been relatively little effect on overall mortality and morbidity. These trends may be signs that priorities for spending in health are no longer as clear as they once were. The health expenditure trends of the last few years will not have the health status impact which they once might have been expected to yield. 3. Trends in growth of health expenditures, their composition and sources, are unlikely to change without a thorough reassessment of health needs and redefinition of objectives and strategy. Without this, over the medium term, health expenditures will probably grow rapidly until they absorb an unacceptable share of national income while providing benefits to only a fraction of the population. Inequities and strong institutional prerogatives will likely become more firmly established and difficult to change. The growing burden of chronic disease amongst an aging, increasingly urban population will probably result in yet further pressures on the health system in this same direction -taking China's health care system down roughly the same unsatisfactory path followed by many OECD nations for the last three decades (see Annex Chapter 4 for rough estimates of the future burden of illness, as derived from the projections model). L9/ Such as widespread primary education, improved access to safe water, better nutrition, sanitation, and improved housing. -9.2 - 4. Alternatives to continuation of present trends hinge on Government deciding to provide substantially greater levels of public subsidies for preventive health care, removal of some revenue earning incentives and pressures for health institutions and providers, continuation of price reform to remove incentives for inappropriate use of technoingies and drugs, development and experimentation with a variety of risk sharing (insurance) programs for those who do fall ill, development of hospital management and hospital service evaluation systems to encourage greater internal efficiency and cost effectiveness, including alternatives to hospitalization. It will also require much broader educational background for most physicians with an emphasis on prevention, much expanded use of less specialized health personnel, and gradual development of a public (social) consensus on priorities and methods for treatment and care of the middle aged and of the elderly chronically ill. 5. The Bank's 1984 sactor report devoted attention to determining the levels of health expenditures, their sources and composition. In light of the changing demographic and epidemiological picture facing China, this chapter reviews current trends in sources and composition and analyzes the dynamics of health expenditures and the underlying reasons for a rapidly changing situation. The general picture which emerges raises questions about the impact of recent ref'orms on the health sector and whether these are compatible with a health strategy that adequately addresses the disease burdens which China will ey?erience over the next half century. The Health Financing System. 6. The sources and channels of health financing in China are extremely varied and complex. They include both direct and indirect government spending, a number of different types of insurance plans, expenditures by industry, by collectives and by private practitioners and patients. We can describe and illustrate the flows of recurrent and capital funding for health services (Annex Chart 9.1 shows in detail the many sources, flows, channels and users). We cannot quantify well the levels and purposes of each of these flows and their precise changes over time. It is possible to make only estimates of total health expenditures today in China. The Government itself has no systematic, estimate of total expenditures for health services. There is no consolidated system of accounting in place and there is confusion over concepts and category of expenditures!. Sources of health financing are disaggregated and the agencies responsible for the major different sources do not routinely share data, and often do not aggregate the data they do keep in a useable form. !i For example, in addition to capital investments furded from the Planning Commissions, some expenditures for equipment are financed from the Finance Bureau's (nominally) recurrent budget allocations. Health institutions also sometimes use allocations for maintenance and depreciation to construct new buildings. Earnings of the institutions can be used for capital investment also, though on the books of the Finance Bureau and the institutions all of these expenditures are often accounted for as recurrent costs.

OA43061 -9.4 - 7. The MOPH has traditionally kept accounts only of public budget-funded health expenditures. With decentralization in recent years the Provincial Finance Bureau now keeps these accounts as most recurrent budget funding for all sectors flows through the Provincial Finance Bureau. The Provincial Health Bureau consolidates these records with capital investment funded by the Provincial Planning Commission and reports the data to the MOPH. They also maintain records of insurance expenditures for civil servants and their dependents covered under the Government Insurance System (GIS). In some provinces, Health Bureau staff have made an effort to consolidate data kept by the Bureau of Labor and Personnel which has records on health expenditures financed under the Labor Insurance System (LIS) for state enterprise employees. Expenditures paid from cooperative insurance funds, township and village enterprise insurance accounts, collective insurance funds and patient payments are much more difficult to collect and only limited sample surveys exist for some of these sources. None of these sources keep reliable track of expenditures by purpose (drugs, diagnostic tests, etc.). 8. It is possible, however, to construct estimates of total health expenditure by source of financing. These estimates can be used to derive a rough approximation of costs by type of expenditure. With presently available data only approximations can be made about the patterns of expenditures by type of health service (hospital in- and out-patients, health clinics, physician visits, etc.) Because of the important, and rapidly changing levels of health expenditures and the many unknown characteristics of the systems, establishment and implementation of a system of reasonably estimating total health costs by source, by type, by institution, by user, etc. should be a high priority research topic which central government agencies should arrange for as soon as possible. Sources of Health Financing 9. Government Budgets. Government has always provided an important share of health financing in China as shown in Annex Table 9.1. Only a portion of recurrent costs are financed from the public health budget, mainly staff salaries in the health bureaus, in public hospitals and other public health institutions, but not the rural doctors, who are essentially fee-for-service practitioners. The public recurrent budget (through the Finance Bureau) alfo finances also some equipment purchases and construction but Planning Commission appropriations (national, provincial and local) cover most major investments. As a share of total health expenditures, the publicly funded portion has become less important over time, declining from 27% (1975) to 18% (1988), largely because most hospitals and other health institutions have been instructed to become self-financing entities by increasing their earnings from services. This move away from greater public risk sharing to a fee-for- service system has been consistent with the trends in other system reform in China. 10. The Insurance Systems. There are four main categories of health insurance in China today. The Government Insurance System (GIS) insures about 22 million civil servants, but not their dependents. The Labor Insurance System (LIS) provides compulsory coverage to all workers of state-owned enterprises (about 75 million persons) and also covers half the costs of -9.5 - medical care incurred by their dependents. A variety of collectively-owned enterprise insurance schemes (covering a maximum of about 35 million workers) and in the last few years also township and village enterprises (covering a maximum of perhaps 49 million workers but probably fewer than this) have grown rapidly in the last few years. Lastly, there are remnants of the old commune insurance system together with a number of experiments, large and small, with mutual insurance systems or sacieties all over China. 11. GIS coverage in terms of members has grown from 16 million persons in 1980 to 25 million in 1988, but administration of the plan has changed little. With the exception of experimental efforts in some provinces the plan requires no deductibles or co-payments. The growth in coverage (number of insured persons) has averaged 7% annually from 1980-1986. The per capita insurance expenditure under the system has grown at over 12% annually during the same pericd. Details of the GIS expenditures and coverage by province are in A-nnex Table 9 2. IThere is considerable variation in the per capita expenditure and growth rates of these among provinces.?/ 12. The LIS appears to have grown even more rapidly than the GIS system. Labor authorities have been unwilling to release comprehensive data on coverage and expenditures for this report. Estimates have thus been developed from official statistical sources. Covered workers were estimated to number about 64 million in 1980 with slow growth (1.5% annually) in numbers covered but with growth from 1980-88 19% annually in the benefits paid per worker. Details of these estimates are presented in Annex Table 9.3 and have been used to develop the overall estimates of levels and rates of growth in health expenditures used in this section. Enterprises are allowed to deduct health and welfare benefit costs (including capital expenditures) from profits before tax. Insurance payments thus represent a considerable indirect public subsidy for the workers involved (at least equal to the marginal tax rate which would apply to the enterprise profits -roughly 40% in many cases, but varying by sector of industry). Health care costs paid through LIS now appear to account for about 8% of the total wage bill for state enterprises, compared to about 5% in 1980. 13. Collective and mutual insurance systems provide a lower level of coverage with per capita cost levels of 25%-75% of the LIS system and they vary in the extent of coverage accorded to family members. Little concrete data is available on precise levels of expenditure and conditions of these systems but reports from around the country coincide to reinforce the conclusion that one unexpected result of the rapid growth of employment in 3 In general the richer provinces have markedly higher per capita levels and expenditure from GIS and higher growth rates. Reasons for these differences are said to be two -a) better care, higher intensity of use and more costly technologies available in the wealthier areas; b) experimentation with co-payment systems and ceilings on reimbursement in some provinces in an attempt to contain the growth. The very low rates of expenditure growth in Henan, Fujian and Anhui Provinces are said to be explained by such experimental approaches. More detailed information is not available for this report. -9.6 - collective and small industries which have flourished in the last five years has been the rapid, grass-roots growth of mutual and self-insurance plans for the workers and their communities.!/ With the contract system in agriculture, labor has been freed from working in primary agricultural activities. Some workers have moved to the growing, small local industries; others have temporarily migrated to regional towns and cities to take up employment in other enterprises, construction, trade and services. Collective enterprises have also generated considerable employment and profits. In all of these cases a number of imaginative arrangements to provide for community health insurance for farm, factory and service workers have emerged. Non-farm laborers often remit part of their income back to the community as contributions to a community mutual insurance system and they, and those who remain in farm work, are covered under this same system. The rates of reimbursement are generally much lower than the GIS or formal LIS schemes. Lower reimbursement rates, co-payment requirements, and ceilings on total amounts of payment appear to heap to constrain cost. and utilization while still providirng some measure of overall protection. Recessionary forces during the last two years may have stopped much of this insurance growth. Sufficiently little is known about overall trends and cumulative effect of the many small systems that this may be a priority area for study and research by Government. 14. Since 1980 considerable attention within China and from abroad has been devoted to discussion of the \"collapse\" or disappearance of the communal rural insurance system which had provided a large measure of equity in access to health services for the peasants in China. The financial and economic reforms which resulted in breakup of the commune system with its work point allocation system for sharing of output and profits was the immediate cause of the rural insurance system demise. Some variations of the former system still survive but these serve far fewer people than at the height of the commune system (the MOPH estimates 10-20% of rural citizens still maintain something resembling the former system). 15. The labor pool and dependents collectively covered by these various insurance arrangements appears to be much larger than had been anticipated a few years ago. The estimates of coverage and payments for collective and township and village enterprises contained in Annex Table 9.3 are not to be interpreted as details of the actual situation but rather estimates of the emerging overall situation. In total about 20% of China's population would appear to be covered from fairly well-established insurance systems. Up to another 10%-15% of the population may have limited collective or communal insurance coverage in some form. In total there are about 800 million uninsured persons in China. Their access to health services and, increasingly, to disease prevention services, depends in part at least on their ability to pay. 16. Patient fee payments are very difficult to estimate and monitor as a source of financing. For all practical purposes all rural, primary health :./ Even amongst the uninsured dependents of the GIS insured employees mutual insur&nce arrangements have been established. -9.7 - services are now provided on fee basis and as most uninsured persons are in rural areas the self-financing burden falls mainly on them. Rural doctors charge a small consultation fee and earn the bulk of their income from the profits on medicines which they dispense. Uninsured patients also pay themselves the full fees charged by clinics, hospitals and other health service institutions at which they seek care (public, enterprise or military owned). As everywhere in the world, patients show a willingness to pay for good care and there have been signs of increased consumption of illness care services as incomes have increased. Sample survey data of non-insured patients by income group, age, sex and illness categories do not exist in enough detail for analysis to reveal how much of recent demand increases may be income related. To complicate matters, for enterprises or in regions where health cost control measures are being experimented with, insured patients are known to sometimes present themselves for treatment without declaring their insurance status in order to save costs!/ and avoid physicians' temptation to over-prescribe dianostic and treatment services and drugs. These patients later seek reimbursement but hospital books would show them as \"self-paid\" patients. Statistics kept at any level of institution generally are difficult to use to separate health care utilization by insurance status. There are not reliable data from which to infer the severity of problems of access, equity and consequent morbidity and death differentials among different income groups or regions. 17. Annex Table 9.3 contains rough estimates of the levels of \"self-paid\" health care expenditure based on the annual tirban and rural household expenditure surveys. Unfortunately the State Statistical Bureau does not dis- aggregate this data as much as would be desirable; the levels estimated are Some regions have attempted to establish a two tier pricing system for health services to avoid unnecessary cost escalation. Self-paid patients and those under the GIS system would be cared for a one set of prices. Those under the LIS and other systems would be cared for at rates approximately twice as high for some services. The intent was to reduce the burden on the public budget and to protect the poor, uninsured. The predictable result was that some enterprises asked staff to report themselves as self-paying patients when they presented for care. Later, the staff would be reimbursed by the enterprise which would thus lower its overall health care bill. -9.8 - believed to be approximately correct, and on the conservative side.!! Chapter 9 of the Main Report discusses levels, trends, changing shares, and growth of health expenditures. Chanzing Purposes of Health ExRenditures 18. Annex Table 9.4 shows public health expenditures (not including the capital investment budget) for 1979 through 1987 by province. The notable features include the increasing share of the budget claimed by higher level hospitals and the decreasing share available to township level hospitals and the anti-epidemic stations (AES) -- >15%, 1980, dropping to <14% in 1985. These changing patterns reflect two things: i) the health transition and, in partial consequence, the increasing demand for higher level hospital care; and, ii) a reduced resource availability for disease prevention and health promotion activities which usually are most effective at the lowest levels of the health system. The MOPH recognized and moved to correct this trend and its consequences in 1987, even though constrained by a very tight budget allocation from the governtment. The budgetary share for township hospitals rose modestly to 18%, and the AES's share reached nearly 15% again. However, the situation may be worse than these time series statistics for budgetary expenditures can reveal. A review of health expenditures patterns and institutional practices and behaviors may help to illustrate this point and the apparent neglect of primary prevention as the fundamental plank of health stracegy. 19. Hospitals. Higher level hospitals have been subjected to increasing demand for patient care in all areas of China. Financial decentralization has meant that local levels of government are mainly responsible for deciding on the budgetary allocations to hospitals in their jurisdiction. Centrally encouraged \"financial responsibility\" policies have also meant that each hospital is expected to earn revenue sufficient to cover most of its recurrent needs other than base salaries of staff most of which are funded through the budget. The principal of charging users for health care is thus wiell established. In general, the higher level hospitals which have the easiest access to higher levels of local government (regional city governments and !! These estimates, plus the insurance expenditures would have to at least equal the gross production value of the pharmaceutical and medical products made annually in China. They also by definition must cover the charges made for diagnostic tests, medical procedures, and out- and in- patient services. Estimates much lower than those contained in Annex Table 9.3 for LIS and \"self-paid\" expenditures would not be adequate to account for sales of pharmaceutical and medical products, about M21 billion in 1987. The inescapable conclusion would be that drugs were accumulating in large quantities in warehouses somewhere in China or were being exported in volume. Trade statistics do not confirm the latter possibility and there are few complaints made public of accumulation of excess stocks of medicines. We therefore conclude that the estimates on which the section are based are roughly right, and probably considerably on the conservative side. -9.9 - provincial governments) where more public 'unds are available. l.ese same hospitals are patronized by local leaders and are thus in best position to request funds for expansion and to purchase more sophisticated technologies to cope with changing health needs. The vast majority of insurance expenditures and patient fees are made for services provided by hospitals. The skewing of expenditures toward treatment and care and away from prevention is thus much more significant than is apparent in Annex Table 9.4. Moreover, the interests of both health service providers and those who most utilize their services substantially coincide in the present system. In a decentralized environment which stresses financial profits, there is virtually no restraint on these shared interests. 20. Lower level hospitals already ha-ve long had lower occupancy rates, poorer facilities, fewer qualified staff and thus a lower reputation. Regardless of whether a patient is insured or uninsured he wants the best acute, curative care he can find. If he is paying for the care he certainly wants to get his money's worth. All of these considerations have led to extreme demands for care at the higher level urban-based hospitals. Pricing and wage policies have put in place other incentives within these hospitals which have only exacerbated the situation. The main theme to be noted here is that the health budget, and total health expenditures, have been increasingly focussed on the higher level hospitals, at the expense of the intermediate and lower levels. Given the influence of the population groups being served by these hospiuals (civil servants, insured workers and wealthier peasants) this trend is unlikely to be redressed without central guidance and funding incentives. 21. The Disease-Prevention Institutions. Unfortunately, the same tenden- cies are visible in the disease prevention institutions in China's system. AES are in general making poor use of the labor and capital resources given them as they are under too much budgetary pressure to earn additional income. As a result, sizeable portions of budgetary funding provided to them for preventive activities are ineffectively used because the AES managers and staff may concentrate tneir time and utilize the laboratory facilities and equipment to respond to local opportunities which can generate revenues for the AES. Examples include performing the laboratory tests for the annual physical examinations of enterprise workers. 22. At many AES, blood samples, urine samples and stool cultures from enterprise workers are scraened for diseases. By virtue of income levels and access to free heal,-It services this population group is amongst the least likely to be effect vely served by the AES. Their exposure to infectious disease vectors is less then other groups and their nutrition and health status generally is better. However, the enterprises, or their insurance plans, are willing to pay for such screening and these payments are deductible from enterp;ise income taxes before profits. The result is that scarce skills of qualified laboratory technicians and some of the capacity of public health laboratory facilities and equipment are occupied with these activities and are therefore not available to serve the remaining risk groups and their disease problems. -9.10 - 23. This helps to explain in part why the prevalence of key infectious and endemic diseases have remained stagnant at moderate levels for some years. AES personnel and facilities simply are not provided the funds and mandate to target these problems effectively. They are devoting the resources to pursue activities which offer the potential for further revenue. 24. Another example is in the public hygiene and sanitation function of the AES. The AES is required to routinely test municipal, city and township water supplies. Very seldom are problems of contamination found. The AES can also test existing water supplies for enterprises and for this they earn revenues. Newly established or expanded enterprises must by regulation have their sources checked, also at a fee. Again, very seldom are problems found. AES stations also apend a good deal of time and energy searching for minute amounts of trace metals and pollutants in water supplies -zinc for example. In the concentrations found, many of these elements could cause no health risk. However, the work is clean, sophisticated and earns income. 25. On the other hand, high rates of gastro-enteric diseases are usually the result of biologically contaminated water. The prevalence of these diseases is highest in the poorest income groups and in conditions of poor sanitation. One would expect to see a concentration of AES water inspecting activities in such areas and where higher disease rates would indicate that problems exist which should be tested Lor and controlled. Instead, the AES staff all too commonly concentrates limited water inspection efforts on the urban areas and factories where disease problems, and positive contamination findings are the least frequent. Some of these tests they are able to charge for, others should rightly be carried out periodically because water quality problems, if they did occur, would effect large numbers of people. However, the result is that the AES does not have remaining budget, staff or a perceived mandate to search out water supply problems. Staff in charge of water testing laboratories say they have no control of where the samples come from. Staff in charge of sampling say they have a busy and ready market which is all they can keep up with given their limited budgets. 26. The same departments which test water are also often asked to test products for local industry. The motivation for local industry seems to be the approval by health authorities of their product. This fact is advertised in marketing of the product. Testing of soft drinks, cosmetics, facial cremes, powders, lotions and other products thus occupy a portion of AES capacity and the makers of these products pay fees for the testing desired. When contaminated samples are found the AES has no regulatory authority to ensure corrective action. The AES also offers training courses for laboratory personnel from industry and from other units. Revenues are earned from many of these courses and of course AES laboratory capacity is occupied by them. 27. Immunizations. The parts of the AES which work best are those for which regular program funding is available -most notably the childhood immunization activities. These have benefitted not only from central government support but also from a considerable amount of external assistance for refrigerators, equipment and supplies. Even these programs are now sometimes short of operational funds however as part of the financial decentralization. Field -9.11 workers travel less frequently, undertake other work and bave more trouLle mobilizing community participation and support. 28. As a resuit many regions arc experimenting with so-called \"immunization insurance\" by which parents are required to pay Rmb.2 for an averaFe ofL two injections each for the seven childhood irmunizable diseases. If the child becomes ill during subsequent years with one of the diseases the local health department will compensate the parents for the cost of his treatment, or death, sometimes with a limit on the total medical charges covered. 29. Some areas seem to respond well to this revenue earning efrort by the AES authorities. It does provide funds to pay incentives to the AES s)aff to encourage their productivity and to allow other preventive programs to be undertaken. Officials point out that this also provides a way to pay incomes to rural doctors to do immunization work which otherwise is uncompensated and detracts from the time which they can devote to more profitable patient treatment. Parents are alleged to value more that which they must pay for and hence to be more cooperative about getting the child immunized or. the appropriate schedule and ensuring that immun'lzation records are kept current. In many urban areas, school and health authorities have combined efforts to encourage immunization by conditioning school or day-care enrollment on properly completed immunization cards. On the whole, these are good developments. It would seem wise from a public health perspective, however, to be cautious in extending the practice of charging for immunization to low income, remote and culturally different areas 30. Health Education. The AES is also responsible in most areas (together with the local Patriotic Health Campaign Committee) for health education programs and for disease prevention programs of many kinds. With only a few local exceptions, these activities of the AES are starved for resources to the point of their being inconsequential. These primary prevention activities earn no revenue. Their outcomes are difficult to measure. There is no influential constituency for preventive activities and health education. One example of the seriousness of this problem is the health education budget in Shaanxi Province. It is reported to h. .fallen from 3% of the AES budget in 1970 to only 0.39% (Rmb.9000) in 1986. There is no other earmarked funding source for health education programs. 31. The data in Annex Table 9.4 for the AES must thus be interpreted with care. AES funding has only declined slightly in its share of the budget. However, many diverse programs must be funded from this budget; a substantial portion of the budget is in effect spent chasing other revenue earning opportunities; there are no earmarked amounts for health education/primary prevention programs, other than EPI. In China, as in many other countries ncluding the United States, financing of prevention and education programs is often one of the last political priorities and is subject to being pushed out of the budget by \"more urgent\" curative and treatment program needs. The lack f a guaranteed, adequate level of funding for prevention programs is one of t most serious, systemic problems facing the health s0ctor. Experience ar nd the world shows that if funding for these programs is left solely to local authorities, it inevitably results in long-term deterioration of funding for the programs. If funding for these programs is primarily from the -9.12 - national level its priority and consistency tends to be eroded by the budgetary claims of other sectors except for short-term increases directly related to major disease outbreaks.!/ For prevention and health education to have the resoucces to be effe-tive over a sustained period it seems to require a continued, high-level, political commitment to prevention and a designated source of financing for prevention activities, not subject to annual budgetary reallocations. 32. In summary, the changing purpose of health expenditures have been moving steadily in favor of higher level hospital services and away from lower level care facilities and from a \"prevention first\" strategy. This should be a matter for urgent consideration and perhaps new approaches in China in light of the findings in earlier parts of this report. Factors Underlving the Changing Purposes of Health SRendi,. 33. The Role of Prices. China's present pricing system for medical services and technology (including drugs) is resulting in overutilization of some medical services and technologies and poses the risk of consequent over- expansion of capacity. The structure of the pricing system needs to be adjusted to be more neutral in relation to incentives for provision and utilization of services and technology. 34. Current policy is that the price charged by health care institutions for medical procedures should be adequate to cover costs, not including basic salaries which are covered by the (HOF) recurrent health budget allocations. Sometimes, the prices approved by local and provincial price bureaus appear to meet this principle, and sometimes the prices far exceed, or fall well short of the principle Case studies attached to Annex Chapter 7 provide a number of examples about the utilization and the pricing of various medical services. Together, these examples highlight a number of aspects of the way the health system is responding to price signals and to decentralization trends which emphasize financial profits at the level of the individual hospital. These tendencies help to explain why China's health care costs are increasing rapidly and why fewer people are likely to be able to benefit from these services unless reforms are put into place to constrain provision and utilization. 35. Part of the problem China faces in applying the general principle that prices should cover costs is that uncertainty surrounds the concept of cost. There are capital costs for purchase and installation of equipment. There are recurrent costs associated with the ownership and utilization of the equipment. Recurrent costs include fixed costs (such as for interest on debt, depreciation, permanently assigned staff, etc.), which are the same from month to month whether the equipment is used or not; and there are variable costs (such as for electricity, reagents, films, spares and maintenance, etc.) which vary directly with utilization of the equipment. Some costs are real, in the 9/ The early 1988 outbreak of hepatitis A in China produced exactly the same kind of short-term response and high level political attention but no longer-term reform and responses. -9.13 - sense that cash must be paid out to meet them (i.e. supplies, power, water or gas, etc.); other costs are notional or accounting costs, which may accrue on the financial statements but may not have to be paid out for many years, or not at all (i.e. depreciation). The concept of costs is often further confused by uncertainty about whether prices should be sufficient to cover average costs, the average variable costs, or the marginal costs of performing a procedure, and so on. As China's financial system is rapidly evolving and as financial goals for welfare sector institutions are a subject of considerable debate everywhere, it is not surprising that lack of clarity and direction exists in China on these points. 36. There are three broad categories of health service prices which exist today -prices which as a result of various historical factors have turned out to be clearly below costs, those which for similar reasons have ended up clearly above costs, and prices for drugs, which have always been deliberately set in such a way as to to allow for a profit. 37. Before the late 1950s, medical care prices were also set according to costs (there were still definitional problems). However, in the late 1950s, the government implemented a policy that health care should be seen as a social service for which cost recovery was not so important; the spirit of this policy led to reductions in prices three times during the 1950s. This action brought fees for technologies and services then in use well below costs, especially for registration fees, inpatient fees, surgical operation costs, and many medical care items. 38. The result of this policy was higher government subsidies to keep hospitals solvent. As part of overall price reform in 1985, prices for many items began to be increased. The objective is to eventually restore them to approximately the 1952 \"real\" level (i.e. approximately the marginal cost of use). However, today prices for most of these \"older\" medical technologies, procedures and services are considerably below cost. 39. For new medical and diagnostic procedures. however, older price guidelines do not exist and, as it is difficult to establish what \"costs\" are, prices are often set by negotiation between the hospital, the local health bureau and the local price bureau, through discussion of \"average costs\" expected to be incurred. The most sensitive assumption in she setting of average cost (and thus price) is the number of times the service or techonology will be used. In general hospitals have an incentive to present purchase plans and price fixing requests based on projected moderate usage, with consequent moderate prices. In practice the service or technology is extensively used with resultant profit to the hospital unit. 40. A number of new tez'hnologies have fees set above costs. The CT scanner is the most prominent example. Fees for laboratory services (by automated equipment), ultrasound examination, coronary care units, and renal dialysis also appear to be set above costs (see Annex Chapter 7). Hospitals may keep a portion of the profits from operating a machine such as a CT scanner, and they use these funds to acquire additional equipment, and then further supplement their incomes. -9.14 - 41. As illustrated in a number of the cases cited in Annex Chapter 7, some technologies tend to be utilized very intensely, probably far more than anticipated at the time that price approvals were given. This shows the problems and dangers inherent in trying to apply market pricing estimation teehniques to services whose supply and demand are both controlled by the groviders of the service. Just as has been found to be the case in the West, escalating health insurance and patient-fee payments would be the predictable, and actual, result of these attempts at price setting. 42. Pricing Rolicy for drugs has deliberately been set to provide a modest profit margin to the hospital. Hospitals pay a controlled wholesale price for drugs and then can mark them up 10%-18% (13% on average).!/ The mark-up is higher for traditional medicine drugs, about 20% on average. 43. The mark-up is intended in theory to cover the costs of hospitals main- taining inventory, spoilage, and other costs. However, there appears to be an obvious incentive for over-prescription and the very high percentage of national health expenditures going for drugs (perhaps more than 50%) seems to substantiate this. The de facto subsidization of the domestic drug industry by the health system, and by the insurance systems in particular, should be the subject of a thorough review by Government. 44. Obvious disadvanatages of this pricing policy include: higher and accelerating health expenditures, increasing equity divisions between the poor and the insured, widespread and growing health problems created by polypharmacy and by excessive utilization of some drugs, a skewing of attention away from primary prevention and toward treatment activities, and potentially excessive investment in the domestic drug industry to create capacity beyond that required if drug use would be reduced to minimum, medically-justified needs. It is possible of course that if prices were less and if all Chinese who medically required drugs had esy access to them that the same or even greater productive capacity would be needed. Obvious financial, but perhaps not economic, benefits of the current drug pricing policy include increased profits, employment and justification for expansion in the domestic drug industry. 45. The State Price Commission is aware of the anomalies in the current pricing system for services and agrees that it is contrary to stated policy. (Problems inherent in the present pricing of drugs do not seem widely recognized, however.) The Price Commission recognizes that other aspects of current pricing policy (the \"older\" technologies and services being priced below marginal, and even below average costs) has made it difficult for hospitals to break even financially. It therefore allows the situation to !i For example, the Zhejiang Provincial Cancer Hospital spent about Rmb. 142 million on drug supplies (both traditional and Western) in 1986, but collected revenues of about Rmb. 181 million in dispensing these drugs. -9.15 - continue while it looks for an overall solution.!/ The Commission is also con- cerned that prices truly set at the level of marginal costs may make health care inaccessible to more people and it wishes to continue the philosophy that health care is a social service, while at the same time encouraging cost-effectiveness of the services. Unfortunately, current arrangements and incentives in the system work strongly against both of these objectives. 46. Today, the principle which is applied in most provinces seems to be that prices should be sufficient to cover recurrent costs (not including basic salaries) averaged over some number of procedures performed per year. Institutions do not, in general, have to meet depreciation costs on buildings or equipment, interest on capital invested, basic salary costs and sometimes other recurrent costs such as administrative overheads. The net result is that prices for many newer items of technology are set well above the financial costs with the result that there is a strong incentive to utilize them as intensively as market conditions will allow, in order to earn financial profits for the institution. At the same time these prices are often low enough in relation to total capital and recurrent cost (including depreciation, debt and salaries) that China's economy is incurring a financial deficit from such utilization of this equipment (i.e., other parts of the economy are subsidizing the costs of hospitals using some technologies). 47. The solution to these pricing questions is easy in principle -China should price the utilization of technology close to \"marginal cost\" net of items covered by the health budget, and thus make it as \"price neutral\" for the health care provider as possible. The profit or loss which the hospital or doctor will incur in using the technology should be so small that it will not influence the choice of technology, its duration, or intensity. This applies to equipment, drugs and hospital services of all types, including beds. 48. In fact, this solution implies a very difficult set of changes to be made. First, establishing the detailed information and level of understanding Several experiments in pricing policy have been tried. In 1981, a policy paper encouraged development of a two price system. The public fee was for those with insurance, and the standard was costs excluding salary. The private fee was lower, generally 50% of the public fee. In Beijing, for example, the health center or outpatient registration fee is Rmb. 0.20 public and Rmb. 0.10 private. The inpatient fee is Rmb. 4 a day public and Rmb. 1 a day private. For example, in Shaanxi Province, the fee for a bed-day in provincial hospitals is Rmb. 1.5 for uninsured patients and Rmb. 4 for insured patients. In all, 17 provinces and cities developed the dual system, including Beijing, Tianjin, and Shanghai and Shaanxi and Shandong provinces. Others, such as Zhejiang Province, however, have only one fee for any service. The objective of this policy was clearly resource mobilization tempered by equity of access considerations. Results have been mixed, with some insured persons being counselled by their employers to register as \"self-paid\" patients. -9.16 - concerning the true nature of costs for different technologies in China will inevitably take a number of years and considerable development of cost accounting techniques in the health system. These are now rudimentary at best and thus badly constrain policy makers from dealing with the complex issues of pricing in relation to cost as they would like. 49. Secondly, the present funding system for hospitals depends heavily on their being able to profit from some technologies and from drugs. Taking away these profit margins would necessitate providing other sources of funding (from overall service income) which would risk worsening the equity of access and may create other problems of cost escalation similar to those experienced in many Western countries. Without a large-scale national insurance system for the majority of the people, this approach also would almost surely risk the hospital network becoming only an elitist system. Even with an insurance system there would be all the usual problems of constraining demand by establishing higher deductibles and development of a Disease Related Groups (DRG) pricing system. 50. An alternative would be to price some services and technologies deliberately higher than marg'nal cost as a source of subsidies for those which are below cost. This approach would necessitate taking the \"profits\" from the individual hospitals and reallocating the subsidies among parts of the health system in accordance with overall health and policy priorities - quite a different route than China has chosen for the moment. 51. Development of the information and management systems to make either of these approaches work would be a heavy task for China and could distract many managers from the already serious problems of mounting an aggressive prevention strategy for the communicable and chronic diseases -i.e. it is obvious, though easily forgotten in the complexity of the situation, that it will clearly be in the best interests of both China's people and its economy if it can develop a good \"health care\" system rather than concentrating on developing a good \"sickness care\" system. 52. This implies that a third, perhaps preferable approach would be for China once again to decide that health care is indeed a \"public responsibility\" and that much of its costs need to be funded through the public budget with subsidies mobilized from the economy at large rather than from amongst the users of any particular hospital or health service. The level and composition of overall health expenditures would need to be decided in relation to the other priority claims on public resources and those decisions should be made as concrete and transparent as possible. They should not be allowed to occur, and to grow out of control as they now are through a series of relatively hidden transfers and subsidies (the labor insurance system, for example), in a way where expenditures cannot be judged in relation to needs and effectiveness. Such an approach would necessitate a significant increase in the budget for health (though not necessarily for overall resource flows) and an improvement in planning and control systems. It would also mandate development of new sources of revenue to finance the public health budget. As should be clear from Annex Chapter 5 (paragraphs to ), fees and taxes on tobacco appear to be a first, and preferred, choice as a source of such revenue. -9.17 - Adaptation to Financial Signals 53. Provider induced escalation of health costs is common today in China, as it has been in various other countries. The reasons for it are two-fold: incentives at the health institution level to earn more revenue by providing more, and more expensive, services; incentives at the provider level to increase care costs as one means of accruing funds from which bonuses can be paid to compensate for excessively low wage rates for the sector. The means by which health care providers accomplish this are found throughout the system (for example, see Box 9.1 on incentives). Part of the incentive to do this is attributable to prices which are set too high, or too low, in relation to costs. But there are other, indirect reasons too. 54. It is difficult to disaggregate the self-interest of providers from that of institutions on these matters. Often institutional financial self-interest corresponds directly to the self-interest of its staff. There is little labor mobility and that mobility which does exist is largely a function of expertise with higher technology services and research. Health workers' status, transfer and promotion prospects are thus partly linked to the sophistication of services which an institution offers. They have a natural interest thus to acquire and utilize intensively the newest technology or medical procedures. To the extent prices charged for use of these technologies are above marginal cost to the institution, the work unit involved makes a \"profit\" and these accumulate to be used for yet more sophisticated equipment purchases, or expansion, or to be paid into workers' welfare funds or given as incentives and bonuses. 55. To complicate consideration of the pricing issues involved, health institutions often receive equipment through the capital budget, or as gifts from well-meaning institutions and friends abroad. There are no incentives in the present financial system to account for the depreciation and maintenance expenses associated with use of this equipment. The units thus see themselves as benefitting from its use whenever revenues exceed cash operating costs and this spurs intensive use. They are classic \"cash cows\". 56. In reality the units are enjoying a significant economic subsidy and are depleting the capital stock which the budget transfers had been intended to provide them. Gifts of equipment, from overseas Chinese, from commercial companies and from foundations, have added to this problem. More experienced hospitals and researchers do not hesitate to use overseas connections and conferences to foster such donations. The costs to the economy, the images conveyed to the populace and doctors alike about what constitutes good health care, the longer-term hidden subsidies, and the signals conveyed throughout the health system by these pricing and gift phenomena do not bode well for China's prospects of future success in dealing with the issues presented in Chapters 1 through 4 of this report. -9.18 - Box 9. 1 Incentlyws Which Inflate Health Care Costa At every level of health institution in China incentives for use of injections is similar, a fee there is visible response to the opportunity for charge in addition to the medicine charge.

Some small part of the changing pattern of health expenditures and their increased growth relative to economic growth can also be ascribed to the ongoing decentralization efforts in China. Decentralization has effectively removed the ability of central health authorities to have much real influence on local expenditure patterns and local authorities lack an adequate fra;nework and experience to see what is happening with health expenditures overall and their longer run consequences. 58. All levels of government are accustomed to thinking in terms of economic development being linked to capital accumulation. In the past, total output and total production were intimately linked with increased capital formation. Efficiency of use of capital was less appreciated. As a result China had the highest incremental capital:output ratios in the world. Economic reforms and use of market prices have begun to change this picture substantially for the economy as a whole. However, for the social sectors in general, and for health in particular, this is not yet the case. Incentives to efficiency in the use of resources in health care are not yet reflected in the pricing and decentralization reforms. Provision of more services, meeting the demand for services, and the incentives of the \"financial responsibility\" system are more or less linked to expansion of capacity, not to enhanced efficiency and rationing of service. Local authorities have no source of information about the overall trends in health care expenditure in China, nor about what it means for them over the longer run. 59. As in the developed countries, economic planners often are under pressures at the local level to defer to the superior technical and medical knowledge of the health care providers about what should be done in the way of new investment and financing for new programs in a region. The health providers not only control the supply of services but the demand for it, by what they prescribe as care. They dictate the new investments and program inputs needed to meet this demand. Local health leaders are in part unqualified to make these decisions; there is conflict of interest on their part. In this area, policies of decentralization appear to have been taken too far and serious consideration should be given to reestablishing mechanisms for policy direction from central and provincial levels of government, procedares for review and approval of capital investment plans and some financial approvals of the use of earnings. 60. The Ministry of Public Health has a better understanding of the long- term trends and their implications for China. With decentralization of health budgets however, the MOPH has lost its effective influence at the provincial level and below. As policy tools the MOPH has only health input planning criteria (ratios of beds to populations, doctors to population, standard lists of equipment for hospitals and AES of different size, etc.). It has inherited these largely from the Soviet approach to health planning. In general, these are inappropriate planning and policy tools and tend to be misused at the local level as they generally strengthen the position of health institutions which want to argue for increased investment, budgets and personnel. -9.4 61. For the future, the MOPH hopes to rely on a set of health laws or regulations to influence local authorities and institutions toward better planning, investment and programs. Experience elsewhere has shown that the legal framework is a relatively ineffective policy lever for a central government to use to influence local governments and institutions in a quasi- federal environment. Without a return to some kind of direct budgetary policy levers, it is very unlikely that China's central authorities will succeed in arresting the general escalation of health budgets as the epidemiologic transition matures. The result is likely to be continued inflation of health costs and an erosion of the shares of GDP available for other sectors of the economy. Leading Issues and Options in Health Finance for China. 62. First, China needs to know reliably how much it is spending on health, for what purposes, from which sources and for what types of services, inputs and diseases. Development of an accounting system to permit this will take a decade or more, and in the meantime sample surveys and case studies %ill provide valuable insights into methodlogies for data collection and assessment. This should be a priority area for research and development of the MOPH's programs. 63. Second, while encouragement of efficient and manageable forms of risk sharing is an obvious social priority of which Government is well aware, current efforts for management of these in decentralized form with fairly firm requirements of financial self-sufficiency will likely be a very slow and difficult process to perfect. Development of pluralistic, decentralized system of insurance plans will be extremely difficttlt and time consuming in any country but with the pricing, financing and behavioral problems dealt with in this chapter will be particularly hard for China. A long period of continued experimentation and development with accounting, costing and risk sharing systems is virtually inevitable unless China decides to return to some form of national health insurance and full, public, risk sharing with surpluses and deficits overall in the plans being managed at fairly aggregate levels (province and national) and strong policy and analytical staff in place to develop and modify payment and other policies to constrain demand to levels consistent with capacity for care and affordability. On the basis of the broad information presented in this chapter the MOPH may wish to cemmission a number of detailed surveys and studies to propose options for government to consider. A key question needing further study is whether it will be more practical, equitable and economically cheaper for China to return to some form of national health insurance, with greater central management of the plan and its benefits, than to depend on the health system reacting to meet demands arising from changing income levels, epidemiology and demography. Further efforts to define clearly the issues for consideration and to explore potential solutions are clearly needed. -9.21 - Annexc Table 9.1 Health Expenditures Current Prices Page 1 of 3 (RMB millions) 1.
