Ingredients 8 servings 1 \u00bc 2 1 4 \u00bd 1 1 2 1 1 3 2 2 2\u00bd Preparation Step 1 Place a rack in middle of oven; preheat to 250\u00b0. Arrange bread in a single layer on a rimmed baking sheet. Bake, tossing occasionally, until dried out, about 1 hour. Let cool; transfer to a very large bowl. Increase oven temperature to 350\u00b0. Step 2 Meanwhile, heat oil in a large skillet over medium-high. Cook onions, fennel, and celery, stirring often, until softened but not yet browned, 8-10 minutes. Add wine and cook, stirring, until almost completely evaporated, about 1 minute. Add butter and cook, stirring, until melted, about 3 minutes. Scrape vegetable mixture over bread in bowl and mix in parsley, sage, rosemary, thyme, salt, and pepper. Step 3 Whisk eggs and broth in a medium bowl to combine. Step 4 Pour over bread mixture; fold gently until thoroughly coated. Step 5 Divide between two 8x8\" baking dishes (you can also put it all in a 13x9\" baking dish if you prefer) and pack stuffing down. Step 6 Cover with foil and bake until you can see some bubbles around the edges of the dishes, 30-35 minutes. Step 7 Increase oven temperature to 425\u00b0. Uncover stuffing and bake until top is golden brown and crisp, 20-25 minutes. Let sit 10 minutes before serving. Step 8 Do Ahead: Bread can be baked 2 days ahead; store airtight at room temperature. Stuffing can be assembled 1 day ahead; cover and chill. Bring to room temperature before baking. How would you rate Classic Herb and Fennel Stuffing?
