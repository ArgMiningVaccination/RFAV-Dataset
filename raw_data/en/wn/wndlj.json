The key is to focus on achieving the following goal: Promote A Micro-environment That Is Not Supportive Of The Development, Proliferation, Progression Or The Metastasis Of Tumor Cells. In conventional Oncology action is taken when a tumor is detected to eradicate the malignancy. After someone is in remission, surveillance is done to uncover a new tumor when it has arisen, at which time action is again taken to eradicate that malignancy. The Integrative Oncology approach uses biomarkers as early signs that may point to greater risk of tumor production or when recurrence may be more likely to occur. This method can be used by anyone who has had a cancer diagnosis to be more proactive than just using standard screening methods for the recurrence of cancer before any action is taken. This approach is also used while patients are undergoing treatment under the care of an Oncologist, to compliment that care. These BIOMARKERS and NUTRIENT LEVELS can be evaluated and monitored as an indicator of progression, or risk of progression of disease. Appropriate steps can be taken when abnormal findings are uncovered. The Most Important nutrients used in Integrative Oncology Omega Fatty Acid Probiotics Berberine Multi-Vit-min with activated B vitamins, without Copper or iron Methylated B12 Vitamin C Quercitin The nutritional content of the diet is always of paramount importance. A low sugar diet is essential. Many advise taking the Dairy and Gluten Free approaches as well. To round out lifestyle recommendations, exercise is important to those with cancer, as it is to everyone else. Many research studies have confirmed this.
