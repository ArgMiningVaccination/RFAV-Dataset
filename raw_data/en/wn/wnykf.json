Many people were recruited to participate in these trials to see how the vaccines offers protection to people of different ages, races, and ethnicities, as well as those with different medical conditions. EXPERIENCING POST COVID SYMPTOMS? Sometimes COVID-19 symptoms can last for months, due to damage caused to lungs, heart, and the brain after first being infected with the virus that caused COVID-19. These conditions are sometimes named \"Long COVID\" or \"Post-COVID-19 Syndrome,\" while others refer to themselves as \"Long Haulers.\" Regardless of the name given, take comfort knowing that help is available.
