A study on different types ofAyurvedic formulations like Churna, Kwath, Gutika,Taila,Ghrita,Avaleha,Asavas,Arista, Bhasma and Pisti. Evaluation of Ayurvedic formulations What is Ayurveda? Is a system of traditional medicine native to the Indian Subcontinent Practiced in other parts of the world like USA, Europe, Australia, New Zealand, Singapore, Malaysia etc as a form of complementary and alternative medicine Involves use of herbs, therapies and Yoga as exercise Or applied on their own as a form of Complementary or Alternative (CAM) treatment Ayurveda - the Wisdom of Life Offers a proven guide for a life of happiness, vitality, love and purpose. Human beings are not viewed as mere thinking physical machines, but Rather as fields of intelligence in dynamic exchange with the energy and information of the environment. Ayurveda - a holistic system A Comprehensive System with equal emphasis on the body, mind and spirit Strives to restore the innate harmony of the individual It is not only about treating sickness but - preventing disease and enhancing health, longevity, vitality and happiness. Vedas It is the bedrock upon which Ayurveda rests Considered to be composed around 1500- 2000 BC Four Vedas Rig-veda :contains hymns to be recited Sam-veda : collection of hymns to be sung Yajur-veda : entire sacrificial rite Athar-veda : contains information on health and sickness EarliestTexts 760 BC 660 BC : Charaka Samhita - herbal or plant based pharmacopoeia : Sushruta - Surgical approaches 7thCentury : Ashtanga Sangraha of Vagbhata - summary of previous two AD 100 1331 : Nagarjuna - iatrochemistry 14thCentury :Sarangadhara Samhita - Pulse diagnosis Ayurveda in 20th Century Ayurveda flourished till 12thcentury, till the Muslim invasion Not much progress from 12th to 17thcentury British invasion : 1833 virtually all Ayurveda schools closed, opening of British medical schools 1920 : a national revival and resurgence of interest in traditional Indian culture and practices 1946 : Formal Govt. recognition and reacceptance of Ayurveda and resurgence of research. Currently, however it holds a secondary place in medicine in India India Govt. officially recognizes as legitimate: Allopathy, Homoeopathy, Naturopathy, Unani Tibb, Ayurveda, and its cousins Siddha and Yoga. Ayurvedic Approach of Health and Disease Promotion of Health Prevention of Disease Ayurveda Science of Longevity with quality of life Holistic management of disease Dosha - 3 (Vata, Pitta, Kapha) Agni Dhatu Mala - 13 (Metabolic fire) - 7 (Body tissues) - 3 (Waste products) Indriya - 5 (Sensory motor organs) Manas - 1 (Mind) Atma - Soul Components of Health Definition of Health Physical & Physiological Psychological Spiritual One whose doshas, agni, functions of doshas and malas are in state of equilibrium, who has cheerful atman, mind, intellect and sense organs is designated as healthy. The Four Components of Life Health according to Ayurveda is perfect balance between Body : Sharir Senses : Indriya Mind : Sattva Spirit (Soul) : Atma INDRIYA (Senses & Functions): Gyan-Indriya (Senses) : Sight, Hearing, Smell, Touch & Taste Karm-Indriya (Voluntary functions) : MANAS (Mind) : Supreme Indriya that controls all Indriyas Has three abstract qualities 'Rajas' and 'Tamas'. ATMA (Soul/Self/Spirit) : Param Atma : Supreme, immortal pure has only Sattva, free of happiness or sorrow. Jiv Atma : resides in living body attached to Rajas and Tamas, witness every function & emotion throughout the life. AYURVEDA TRIDOSHA THEORY- 3 DOSHAS PANCHAMAHABHUTA THEORY- 5 JALA Water AGNI Fire VAYU Air AKASH Space EQUILIBRIUM of 3 DOSHAS DISEQUILIBRIUM of 3 DOSHAS HEALTH DISEASE SOULKAPHA + Effecting Human Physiology Space : In the human body, many spaces are aspects of the Space element. The spaces in the mouth, nose, tract,gastrointestinal tract, respiratory abdomen, thorax, capillaries, etc. Air : All movements involve Air as an element. The nature of the elements themselves determine the nature of physiology. With the human body Air is present in the pulsations of the heart, lungs etc. Fire : The source of Fire and light in the solar system is the sun. In the human body, the source of Fire is metabolism. Fire works in the digestive system as well as in the gray matter of the brain, where Fire manifests as intelligence. Fire also activates the retina to perceive light. Therefore body temperature, digestion, thinking etc are all the functions of the Fire. Water: It manifests in the body as the secretions of digestive juices, in the mucous membranes and in plasma and cytoplasm. Water is vital for the functioning of all the systems of the body. For example, dehydration resulting from diarrhea and vomiting is due to water element. Earth : The fifth element, is also present in the microcosm of the human being. Life is possible on this planet because the Earth holds all living and non-living substances to its solid surface. Tridosha Ayurveda is based on 3 energies. Their balanced state is health and imbalance disease. VATA - the kinetic energy, movement, division, growth, etc. PITTA - the thermal energy, heat generation, intellect,sight, etc. KAPHA - the potential energy Tridoshas are Vata, Pitta & Kapha Tridosha concept is applicable in living organisms Tridoshas are biological entities responsible for structure, function and behaviour dimensions of all living organisms Therefore human body mind constitution (Prakriti), diseases, Medicines and Food all has been categorized in Vata type, Pitta type and Kapha type. But nothing is absolute pure; every thing is permutation and combination of Tridoshas Concept of Prakriti (Body Mind Constitution and Temperament) Concept of Prakriti (human constitution) is related to physiological attributes to health and disease. Prakriti is determined by relative predominance of dosha in intra-uterine life of a fetus. Prakriti is unchangeable throughout the life span, but One can take remedial measures in diet and behavior suitable to his/her prakriti to maintain health and prevention of disease. Significance of Prakriti in Clinical Medicine For Promotive & Preventive Health - - Know your prakriti and diseases susceptibility Prakriti will tell the risk factors, course of disease, complications and prognosis - Follow your diet, behaviour, profession and life style suitable to your prakriti to lead a healthy life. Curative Health - - - Select the drugs and dose as per prakriti Drug body interaction and reaction pattern depend upon the prakriti of individual & drug Associated complications of a disease, prognosis and their treatment can be improved as per prakriti of disease & individual Concept of Sapta Dhatus ( 7 Body Tissues) Body is made up of Seven Tissues and their function is to maintain the body matrix 1. Rasa (Plasma) 3. Mansa (Muscles) 4. Medas (Fats) 5. Asthi (Bones) 6. Majja (Bone marrow) 7. Shukra (Reproductive tissues) 2. Rakta (Blood) Ojas (Responsible for Immunity) Causes of diseases... Man made activities - Prajnaparadha Environmental factors Genetic factors Psychological factors.... Diagnosis in Ayurveda The two main pillars on which the diagnosis History of Illness: Examination of the Patient: a) General Examination or Ashta Vidha Pariksha: Examination of the pulse (Naadi Pariksha), Tongue, Urine and stool examination, Speech, Examination by palpation and percussion, Gait (bodily movement), General appearance of the patient, and Examination of the constitution (Prakriti). b) Systemic Examination: This consists of examination of the different systems, Skin and Hair, and Eyes . The factors responsible for prevention of illness and promotion of health Day regimen (Dinacharya) Night regimen (Ratricharya ) Seasonal regimen (Rutucharya) Seasonal Purification (Rutu anusara treatment modalities Pacification Treatment Purification Treatment Pacifies doshas locally Removes doshas from body Comparatively of temporary Effect lasts for long action. Done in minimal or moderate dosha and of minimal or moderate strength Done in profound dosha and of profound strength Does not interfere much with tissues (dhatus) Normalizes tissue (dhatu) functions DrugTherapy in Ayurveda DRUG (AUSHADHA) \"One which ensures alleviation the disease but does not give rise to any other disorders\" PLANT origin MINERAL origin ANIMAL origin Single or Compound formulations of above Employed as per 'Yukti' (planning). Caring the Nature Protection of Ecosystem Cultivation of medicinal plants Prevents massive exploitation of natural resources Preventing pollution.... Benefits of Ayurveda Physical Benefits The basic constitution represents the individual's psychological and physical nature, distinctly. Non-invasive diagnostic Ayurvedic treatments are beneficial for chronic diseases such as diabetes, heart ailments and cancer. Difficult diseases like asthma and tumor growths (gulmas) are managed effectively. A discerning diet according to one's dosha type, and well regulated life (dinacharya) helps strengthen one's natural immune system. Detoxification methods like Panchakarma and other herbal remedies make the body more responsive to medicines and treatment. It hastens the healing process. Yogasanas achieve the twin purpose of strengthening body-parts such as bone, muscle and vital organs like heart, liver, stomach, intestine as well as Keeping out blood circulation and psychological conditions strong and resilient. Psychological Benefits: It is said that the condition of body and mind are integral to the overall health of an individual. Ayurvedic massages, inhalation of herbal (Aromatherapy) preparations, panchakarma (nasya) besides much-tested yogasanas and meditation leave a calming effect on the nerves. Spiritual Benefits: The treatment methods, diet and lifestyle regimen in Ayurveda are meticulously planned to heal the body as well enrich the mind So that each can improve from their own levels to the higher goal of realizing the full self-potential. It was with Ayurveda that the unique longevity and rejuvenating method of rasayana was born for mankind to progress in the path of spirituality. Ayurveda is not only treatment, it is a way of life Has no side effects Gives happy, healthy disease free long life Makes you Tension Free Relaxes mind Provides knowledge about life Tells about good and bad dietary effects to life Tells the way for life goals, with keeping good health status Summary of Benefits of Ayurveda Macroscopic study Visual inspection provides the simplest and quickest means by which to establish identity, purity and quality. Macroscopic identity of medicinal plant materials is based on shape, size, colour, surface characteristics, texture, fracture characteristics and appearance of the cut surface. Microscopic study Detail of cell structure and arrangement of the cells useful for differentiating similar species. Select a representative sample of the material & If it is dried parts of a plant than it may require softening before preparation for microscopy, preferably by being placed in a moist atmosphere, or by soaking in water. Any water-soluble contents can be removed from the cells by soaking in water. Starch grains can be gelatinized by heating in water. Measurement of specimen Stomatal number Lycopodium spore method Foreign organic matter Parts of the medicinal plant material or materials other than those named with the limits specified for the plant material concerned; Any organism, part or product of an organism, other than that named in the specification and description of the plant material concerned; Mineral admixtures that is adhering to the medicinal plant materials, such as soil, stones, sand, and dust. Foreign matter: NMT 2%w/w Ash value It involves non-volatile inorganic components. High ash value is the indicative of contamination, substitution, adulteration or carelessness in preparing the crude drugs. Total ash Total ash is designed to measure the total amount of material produced after complete incineration of the drug material at as low temperature as possible (about 450\u00b0C) to remove all the carbons. Total ash usually consists of carbonates, phosphates, silicates insoluble ash Ash insoluble in HCl is the residue obtained after extracting the total ash with HCl. It gives idea about the earthy matter 25 ml of hydrochloric acid (~70g/l) Water soluble ash Total ash content which is soluble in water. It's good indicator of presence of previous extraction of water soluble salts in the drug or incorrect preparation or amount of inorg. matter Carbonated ash: Ash is treated with ammonium carbonate. Nitrated ash: Ash is treated with dilute nitric acid. Extractive value Amount of the active constituents present in crude drug material when extracted with specific solvent. There are following Methods for determin- -nation of Extractive value. a) Cold method b) Hot method c)Soxhlet method Insoluble matter: Presence of woody matter or vegetable debris or pieces of bark materials. Eg. In Total solid content The residue obtained when prescribed amount of preparation is dried to constant weight under the specified condition (Residue on evaporation) Powdered extract: NLT 95% Semisolid extract: Volumetric Azeotropic distillation (toluene distillation) method Titrimetric Karl fisher method Gas chromatographic method Volatile oil content Volatile oils are the liquid components of the plant cells, immiscible with water, volatile at ordinary temperature and can be steam distilled at ordinary pressure Many herbal drugs contain volatile oil which is used as flavourig agent. E.g. Clove: NLT 15%v/w Bitterness value Medicinal plant materials that have a strong bitter taste (\"bitters\") are employed therapeutically, mostly as appetizing agents. Their bitterness stimulates secretions in the gastrointestinal tract, especially of gastric juice. The bitter properties of plant material are determined by comparing the threshold bitter concentration of an extract of the materials with that of a dilute solution of quinine hydrochloride. The bitterness value is expressed in units equivalent to the bitterness of a solution containing 1g of quinine hydrochloride R in 2000 ml. Bitterness value calculated in units per g using the following formula: Where, a= the concentration of the stock test solution (ST) (mg/ml), b = the volume of test solution ST(in ml) in the tube with the threshold bitter concentration, c = the volume of quinine hydrochloride R (in mg) in the tube with the threshold bitter concentration. Haemolytic activity Many medicinal plant materials, of the families Caryophyllaceae, Araliaceae, Sapindaceae, Primulaceae, and Dioscoreaceae contain saponins. The most characteristic property of saponins is their ability to cause haemolysis; when added to a suspension of blood, saponins produce changes in erythrocyte membranes, causing haemoglobin to diffuse into the surrounding medium. The haemolytic activity of plant materials, or a preparation containing saponins, is determined by comparison with that of a reference material, saponin R, which has a haemolytic activity of 1000 units per g. Calculate the haemolytic activity of the medicinal plant material using the following formula: 1000 \u00d7a/b Where, 1000 = the defined haemolytic activity of saponin R in relation to ox blood, a = quantity of saponin R that produces total haemolysis (g) b = quantity of plant material that produces total haemolysis (g) Determination of tannins Tannins (or tanning substances) are substances capable of turning animal hides into leather by binding proteins to form water-insoluble substances that are resistant to proteolytic enzymes. This process, when applied to living tissue, is known as an \"astringent\" action and is the reason for the therapeutic application of tannins. Chemically, tannins are complex substances; usually occur as mixtures of polyphenols that are difficult to separate and Calculate the quantity of tannins as a percentage using the following formula: where w = the weight of the plant material in grams T1= Weight of material extracted in water T2= Weight of material not bound to hide powder T0= Weight of hide powder material soluble in water Determination of swelling index The swelling index is the volume in ml taken up by the swelling of 1 g of plant material under specified conditions. Its determination is based on the addition of water or a swelling agent as specified in the test procedure for each individual plant material (either whole, cut or pulverized). Determination of foaming index Many medicinal plant materials contain saponins that can cause a persistent foam when an aqueous decoction is shaken. The foaming ability of an aqueous decoction of plant materials and their extracts is measured in terms of a foaming index. Calculate the foaming index using the following formula: foaming index = where a = the volume in ml of the decoction used for preparing the dilution in the tube where foaming to a height of 1 cm is observed. Determination of pesticide residues Not more than 1% An ARL (in mg of pesticide per kg of plant material) can be calculated on the basis of the maximum acceptable daily intake of the pesticide for humans (ADI), as, recommended WHO, and the mean daily intake (MDI) of the medicinal plant material. ADI = maximum acceptable daily intake of pesticide (mg/kg of body weight); E = extraction factor, which determines the transition rate of the pesticide from the plant material into the dosage form; MDI = mean daily intake of medicinal plant product. Some example of Pesticides : Chlorinated hydrocarbons oxide, methyl bromide Pesticides of plant origin: tobacco leaf and nicotine; pyrethrum derris root and rotenoids. Determination of arsenic and heavy metals Contamination of medicinal plant materials with arsenic and heavy metals can be attributed to many causes including environmental pollution and traces of pesticides. Limit test for arsenic Limit test for cadmium and lead The contents of lead and cadmium may be determined by inverse voltametry or by atomic emission spectrophotometry. The following maximum amounts in dried plant materials, which are based on the ADI values, are proposed: lead, 10 mg/kg; cadmium, 0.3 mg/kg. Aflatoxins Content Aflatoxins are naturally produced mainly Aspergillus flavus and Aspergillus parasiticus. The presence of aflatoxins can be determined by chromatographic methods using standard aflatoxins B1, B2, G1, contamination The range of radionuclides that may be released into the environment as the result of a nuclear accident might include long-lived and short-lived fission products, actinides, and activation products. Microbial growth in herbals is usually avoided by irradiation. This process may sterilize the plant material but the radioactivity hazard should be taken into account. The nature and the intensity of radionuclides released may differ markedly and depend on the source (reactor, reprocessing plant, fuel fabrication plant, isotope production unit, etc.). The radioactivity of the plant samples should be checked accordingly to the guidelines of International Atomic CHROMATOGRAPHY OF HERBAL DRUG Seperation, identification, impurity detection and assay of herbal drug in the formulation or in the extract are carried out by following methods :- a)TLC b)HPTLC c)HPLC/Densitometric chromatography d)GLC 2. Physical Parameters a) Determination of foreign organic matter b) Determination of ash value Total ash value Acid insoluble ash Water soluble ash Sulphated ash c) Determination of extractive value Alcohol soluble extractive value Water soluble extractive value d) Determination of moisture content e) Determination of physical constant Melting point Boiling point Refractive index Optical rotation f) Determination of specific gravity g) Determination of solid content h) Determination of alcohol content 3. Chemical tests a) Alkaloids - Dragandroffs test b) Glycosides - Molish test c) Flavonoids - Shinoda test d) Phenolic - Lead acetate test e) Tannins - Ferric chloride test f) Steroids - Salkowski reaction g) Amino acids - Ninhydrine test h) Carbohydrates - Fehling's test, Benedict test 4.
