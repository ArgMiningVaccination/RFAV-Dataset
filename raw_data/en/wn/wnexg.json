On behalf of the CHC, the Victorian Minister for Health, the Hon. Jenny Mikakos MP, instructed Safer Care Victoria (SCV) to undertake an independent review of the practice of chiropractic spinal manipulation on children under 12 years. The findings of this re view are to be provided to the Minister for reporting to the CHC. To provide expert guidance and advice to inform the review, SCV established a n independent advisory panel . The panel includ ed expertise in chiropractic care , academic allied health, health p ractitioner regulation, healthcare evidence, governance, paediatrics and paediatric surgery, and musculoskeletal care, and had consumer representation. The panel's role was to provide advice to assist SCV in scoping the review, interpretation of the findi ngs, and in developing their recommendations. In order to provide this advice, the panel decided to undertake a public consultation as well as consider evidence from the relevant complaints and regulatory bodies alongside a systematic review of the literat ure. The review comprised a search for evidence of harm, a review of evidence of effectiveness, an online public consultation and an online consultation with health practitioners. Detailed descriptions of these different components of the review are provid ed in this report. The scope of the review included spinal manipulation in children under 12 years of age. Spinal manipulation as defined in Section 123 of the Health Practitioner Regulation National Law Act 2009 (National Law) is one of many techniques performed by chiropractors. For the purpose of collecting all relevant evidence, the panel agreed to a definition of spinal manipulation aligned to that defined in Section 123 of National Law. Spinal manipulation was defined as \"any technique delivered by any health professional that involves a high velocity, low amplitude thrust beyond the physiological range of motion, impacting the spine, within the limits of anatomical integrity .\" The panel also determined that, while the reco mmendations are focused primarily on the chiropractic profession, other professions permitted to do spinal manipulation will likely be implicated should there be legislative or policy implications as a result of this review. Section 123 of National Law res tricts the practice of spinal manipulation of the cervical spine to four health professions: chiropractic, osteopathy, medical and physiotherapy. Further content regarding the review process and in -depth findings have been detailed in this report. Executive summary Chiropractic spinal manipulation of children under 12 Safer CareVictoria 3 SUMM ARY OF FINDINGS Review of evidence of harm An extensive search was undertaken to identify evidence of harm sustained by children who had received spinal manipulation. This included a literature review by Cochrane Australia, capture of patient complaints an d practitioner notification data from Australian complaints and regulatory agencies, capture of Australian insurance claim data from the primary insurers for registered chiropractors, and stakeholder feedback from both online consultations. This extensive search identified very little evidence of patient harm occurring in Australia. In particular, there were no patient complaints or practitioner notifications that arose from significant harm to a child following spinal manipulation. Three individual case re ports were the only evidence of serious harm identified. Each of these reports related to spinal manipulative techniques performed outside of Australia and not limited to chiropractors. The practices described in these reports are not reflective of Austral ian chiropractic techniques. This does not mean spinal manipulation in children is not associated with any risk of any adverse effects. An extensive literature review did identify transient or minor adverse events but the prevalence was very low, albeit po ssibly more common in very young children. There are two principl e reasons why the search did not find strong evidence of harm in Australia. First, it is unlikely that spinal manipulation , as defined within the scope of the review, is a technique that is being routinely applied in Australia to young children or those with an immature spine. Second, skilled chiropractic care requires the practitioner to modify the force applied based on the age and development al stage of the child. This means that children, particularly very young children, under the care of an Australian chiropractor are not likely to be receiving high impact manipulations. Nonetheless, it is clear that spinal manipulation in children is not wholly without risk. Any risk associated with car e, no matter how uncommon or minor, must be considered in light of any potential or likely benefits. This is particularly important in younger children, especially those under the age of 2 years in whom minor adverse events may be more common. 4 Safer Care Victoria Chiropractic spinal manipulation of children under 12 Review of evidence of effectiveness SCV commissioned Cochrane Australia to undertake a systematic review of the effectiveness and safety of spinal manipulation of children under 12 years for any condition or symptom, irrespective of the profession providing treatment. The major finding of this review is that the evidence base for spinal manipulation in children is very poor. In particular , no studies have been performed in Australia. Specifically, the comprehensive review of the literature failed to identify any strong evidence for the effectiv eness of spinal manipulation for a variety of conditions for which children are widely offered chiropractic manipulations. These conditions included colic, enuresis, back/neck pain, headache, asthma, otitis media, cerebral palsy, hyperactivity and torticol lis. There was low certainty (weak) evidence that spinal manipulation may be beneficial for modestly reducing crying time in children with colic, or for reducing the number of wet nights in children with enuresis. For both conditions the evidence was also consistent with either no or worsening effects. For the other conditions - headache, asthma, otitis media, cerebral palsy, hyperactivity, and torticollis - there was no evidence that spinal manipulation was effective. Based on this review of effectiveness , spinal manipulation of children cannot be recommended for: headache asthma otitis media cerebral palsy hyperactivity disorders torticollis . The possible, but unlikely, benefits of spinal manipulation in the management of colic or enuresis should be b alanced by the possibility, albeit rare, of minor harm. Chiropractic spinal manipulation of children under 12 Safer CareVictoria 5 Public consultation SCV wished to hear from parents and guardians of children who had accessed chiropractic spinal care, exploring their experiences, both positive and negative. This was achieved th rough an online consultation process using the Victorian Government's Engage. Vic platform. Through this platform, 21,824 submissions were received from members of the public who had accessed chiropractic spinal care for a child under 12 years. This is the largest number of submissions received to date through Engage.Vic or any public stakeholder engagement. The public responses indicated very strong consumer satisfaction. Of all respondents, 99.7% (21,750) reported a positive experience with the chiropracti c care of their children. The overwhelming majority of parents /guardians reported that chiropractic spinal care helped their child, with 98% (21,474) indicating that their child improved after treatment. It was clear that parents /guardians appreciated the time that their child's chiropractor took to listen to their child's symptoms and to engage with them and their child. A sentiment that was strongly expressed was the right of a parent /guardian to choose their child's care. Parents /guardians reported that they accessed chiropractic care for their child for a wide range of conditions and complaints, including maintaining general health and wellbeing. The most common conditions included posture concerns, colic, neck pain, difficulty with breastfeeding, back p ain and headache. A very small minority of respondents - 0.3% (74) - reported a negative experience. These experiences mostly related to concerns about the cost of treatment with no improvement in the condition, excessive use of X-rays, or perceived pressure to avoid medications or advice previously provided by other pract itioners, including medical practitioners. Health practitioner consultation SCV wished to hear from registered health practitioners - chiropractors, medical practitioners and other health practitioners - about perceived benefits of or concerns with spinal manipulation in children. This was also achieved through an online consultation process using the Engage.Vic platform. A total of 2735 responses were received from practitioners, 85% (2315) of whom had provided spinal care to a child under 12 in the past three years. Of those providing care, 99.5% (2303) were chiropractors, 80.8% (1871 out of 2315) had treat ed children aged 0 -3 months , and 88.5% (2049 out of 2315) had treat ed children aged 0 -24 months . The most common benefits of spinal manipulation reporte d by practitioners were relief from pain, better sleep quality, more relaxed or settled child, able to feed and latch better, and improved mobility or range of motion. There were responses from 13 practitioners who had provided care to a child who had prev iously received spinal care from a different practitioner. These responses raised concern s about the risk of delayed access to appropriate care as a result of seeking non -evidence based spinal care (e.g. delayed diagnosis of scoliosis) . No examples or expe riences of serious harm were reported through this consultation. 6 Safer Care Victoria Chiropractic spinal manipulation of children under 12 SUMMARY OF RECOMMENDATIONS These recommendations are based on the findings as outlined earlier in this report . In arriving at the recommendations , SCV has sought to strike a balance between divers e, and , at times , directly opposed, views . In particular, SCV sought to make recommendations that would both respect a parent's or guardian's right to choose appropriate healthcare options for their child while ensuring that children, particularly t he very young who are less able to communicate adverse effects, are safe. This was not easy. To say that the lack of strong evidence of either effectiveness or serious harm failed to provide robust foundations for recommendations would be a n understatemen t. Nonetheless, in the absence of evidence of effectiveness and the awareness of the potential for harm expressed by the need for Section 123 of the National Law, SCV took a 'first do no harm ' approach. Improving safety Recommendation 1 Spinal manipulati on, as defined in Section 123 of National Law, should not be provided to children under 12 years of age, by any practitioner, for general wellness or for the management of the following conditions: developmental and behavioural disorders, hyperactivity disorder s, autis m spectrum disorders, asthma, infantile colic, bedwetting, ear infections , digestive problems , headache, cerebral palsy and torticollis . Section 123 of National Law defines spinal manipulation as \"moving the joints of the cervical spine beyond a person's usu al physiological range of motion using a high velocity, low amplitude thrust.\"1 This recommendation is based on the lack of evidence of e ffectiveness for these conditions and the current statement on advertising regarding inappropriate claims of benefit, made by the Chiropractic Board of Australia .2 Recommendation 2 All national boards of the health practitioners permitted to perform spinal manipulation (chiropractic, osteopathy, medical and physiotherapy) should consider Recommendation 1 when reviewing their current policies, if any, on spinal manipulation of children. Recommendation 3 Prior to treatment, practi tioners offering spinal manipulation for children should provide parents or guardians with written information about the proposed benefits and possible risks of care. In their statement on paediatric care, the Chiropractic Board of Australia already expect s practitioners to provide parents such information. This recommendation would require that the information is provided in written form. Recommendation 4 The national boards should periodically review notification data to identify any trends or evidence o f harm that may require changes in policy, in line with the principles of risk - based regulation. 1 Health Practitioner Regulation National Law Act 2009 (https://www.legislation.qld.gov.au/view/html /inforce/current/act -2009 -045#sec.123 ) 2 Chiropractic Board advertising (2016) ( https://www.chiropracticboard.gov.au/News/2016 -03-07-statement -on-advertising.aspx ) Chiropractic spinal manipulation of children under 12 Safer CareVictoria 7 Improving quality Recommendation 5 Given the lack of Australian -based clinical trial evidence, the practitioner groups permitted to provide spinal manipula tion (chiropractic, osteopathy, medical and physiotherapy) urgently undertake research to develop an evidence base for spinal manipulation on children, ceasing practice where the evidence shows no benefit. Health Ministers should consider whether relevant funding bodies (e.g. NHMRC, MRFF) specifically allocate funding for a priority targeted research call to address this evidence gap. Recommendation 6 Practitioner groups that provide spinal manipulation (chiropractic, osteopathy, medical and physiotherapy) must lead on developing evidence -based guidance on spinal manipulation of children for both practitioners and consumers, using National Health and Medical Research Council e ndorsed methods. Such guidance material should form the basis of written information for parents, advising them of proposed benefits and potential risks of intended care (see Recommendation 3). Recommendation 7 Consideration should be given by the Chirop ractic Board of Australia to various models of advanced training in paediatric chiropractic care, particularly in spinal manipulation. In the longer term, the post registration training on offer to chiropractors with a special interest in paediatric care s hould be assessed against the evidence -based guidelines. Eliminating false advertising Recommendation 8 The Australian Health Practitioner Regulation Agency (AHPRA) and the national boards should continue to audit practitioners in the application of thei r guidance regarding advertising. Recommendation 9 The national boards should consider whether explicitly prohibitive advertising statements are issued regarding spinal manipulation in children where there is evidence of no benefit, as detailed in Recommendation 1. Recommendation 10 Health Ministers should consider increasing pena lties for advertising offences under Section 133 of the National Law, where a registered practitioner claims benefits of spinal manipulation in children that have no evidence base (see Recommendation 1). The current penalty for advertising offenses under Section 133 of the National Law is a maximum of $5000 for an individual and $10,000 for a corporation. These are substantially lower than penalties allowable under the National Law for falsely claiming to be a registered practitioner ($60,000 for an individ ual and $120,000 for a corporation) or for misleading advertising under Australian consumer law ($220,000 for an individual). 8 Safer Care Victoria Chiropractic spinal manipulation of children under 12 BACKGROUND The Health Practitioner Regulation National Law Act 2009 (National Law) recognises the protected practice of spinal manipulation of the cervical spine. Section 123 of the National Law restricts the practice of spinal manipulation of the cervical spine to four health professions; chiropractic, osteopathy, medical and physiotherapy. The definition of sp inal manipulation for the purpose of this restriction \"means moving the joints of the cervical spine beyond a person's usual physiological range of motion using a high velocity, low amplitude thrust\" .3 The restriction on practice to the four health profes sions was introduced as a proactive step to protect the public from a high -risk technique being performed on them by inadequately trained providers. At the time of introduction, it was noted that the evidence base for the technique , both with regards to effectiveness or harm, was limited. Nonetheless, implicit in the restriction was the acknowledgement that spinal manipulation, particularly rotary or forceful manipulation of the cervical spine, has inherent risks of harm . Indeed , at the time o f introducing the restriction on practice the Australian Chiropractors Association (ACA) (formerly the Chiropractors Association of Australia) advocated for tougher restrictions . Specifically, the ACA argued for the restricted practice to include whole spi ne manipulation and to exclude health practitioners not specifically registered and/or suitably qualified to perform spinal manipulation.4 It is also generally acknowledged that children are more vulnerable to injury from spinal manipulation than adults. This is because excessive movements beyond physiological norm and safety are made possible by the incomplete anatomical development of the child, particularly a very young child. In 2017, the Chiropractic Board of Australia (the Board) released a position statement on paediatric care. This statement references the Code of Conduct for registered chiropractors and guidelines for advertising , including the Board's specific statement on advertising .5 The Board continues to monitor compliance with thei r guidance and act when required. The following is an excerpt from the Board's June 2017 position statement: The Board expects practitioners to make sure their clinical practice is consistent with current evidence and/or best -practice approaches. Practiti oners should critically evaluate their strengths and weaknesses and use continuing professional development (CPD) and other educational tools to ensure their knowledge and skills are appropriate for their work. 3 Australian Health Practitioner Regulation Agency: Reporting a cr iminal offence (https://www.ahpra.gov.au/Notifications/Raise -a-concern/Reporting -a- criminal -offence.aspx) 4 Parliament of Australia: Chapter 2 Design of The National Registration and Accreditation Scheme for Doctors and Other Health Workers (https://www.ap h.gov.au/Parliamentary_Business/Committees/Senate/Community_Affairs/Completed_inquiries/2008 - 10/registration_accreditation_scheme/report/c02 ) 5Chiropractic Board of Australia Statement on advertising (2016) (https://www.chiropracticboard.gov.au/News/2016 -03-07-statement -on-advertising.aspx)Independent review Chiropractic spinal manipulation of children under 12 Safer CareVictoria 9 The Board expects practitioners to: discuss their proposed management plan with the patient's parent and/or guardian inform the parent and/or guardian about the quality of the acceptable evidence and explain the basis for the proposed treatment provide patients (or parent and/or guardian) wi th information about the risks and benefits of the proposed treatment and the risks of receiving no treatment understand that children have significant anatomical, physiological, developmental and psychological differences and needs from adults and that th eir healthcare management requires specific skills and exper tise; including informed consent, examination, diagnosis, referral of 'red flags' and contraindications to care modify all care and treatment (including technique and force) to suit the age, prese ntation and development of the patient promptly refer patients to the care of other registered health practitioners when they have conditions or symptoms outside a chiropractor's scope of practice, for example 'red flags', and communicate effectively with other health practitioners involved with the care of the patient such as the patient's general practitioner or paediatrician .6 In August 2018 , a Melbourne -based chiropractor posted on social media a video of a technique being performed on a two -week -old ba by. This video generated much public concern at the time. In February 2019 , the video was brought to the attention of the Victorian Minister for Health, after which prompt action was taken to urge the Australian Health Practitioner Regulation Agency (AHPRA ) to take immediate action. In an interview with ABC Radio Melbourne, t he president of the Australian Chiropractors Association, Anthony Coxon, said he was \"disturbed\" by some of what was shown in the video, and he welcomed the investigation by the chirop ractic board and AHPRA. \"There are things within that video that I have concerns over,\" he said.7 In response to the concerns noted by the CHC and to protect the public, on 14 March 2019 the Board published the Interim policy on spinal manipulation for infants and young children .8 In this policy , the Board advised \" chiropractors to not use spinal manipulation to treat children under two years of age .\" The interim policy was to be in place pending the outcomes of a n independent review by SCV - this review. The Victorian Minister for Health , the Hon . Jenny Mikakos MP, asked SCV , as Victoria's healthcare quality and safety improvement agency , to lead an independent review into chiropractic spinal manipulation of child ren under 12 years . 6 Chiropractic Board of Australia: Statement 8 Chiropractic Board of Australia Interim policy on spinal manipulation for infants and young children (2019) (https://www.chiropracticboard.gov.au/Codes - guidelines/Position -statements.aspx) 10 Safer Care Victoria Chiropractic spinal manipulation of children under 12 INDEPENDENT EXPERT ADVISORY PANEL Role of the panel SCV established an independent expert advisory panel to oversee and advise on the review, enabling SCV to mak e findings and provide recommendations to the Victorian Minister for Health by October 2019. Specifically, the panel was engaged to: develop and endorse the scope of the resulting review set the parameters for the literature searches and systematic review determine the questions to be asked through the public and health practitioner consultations use all evidence gathered to inform SCV's findings and final recommendations. The panel met on nine occasions throughout a six-month review period to provide over sight and consider information as it became available. Panel membership The Minister for Health appointed the Chief Executive Officer of SCV to chair the panel. Panel members were selected to include experts in chiropractic care , academic allied health, healthcare evidence, governance, paediatrics and paediatric surgery, and musculoskeletal care. Reflecting how SCV approaches all matters of healthcare improvement, the advisory panel had strong and effective consumer representatio n.

When the review was announced, t he footage shared in the media appeared to show potentially harmful manipulative techniques being performed by Australian -register ed chiropractors. During the design of this review it was recognised that there are strong and diverse views of chiropractic care , both among the public and health practitioners. Reflecting this, it was a purposeful decision that the advisory panel establ ished by SCV was not only expert but also diver se and included experienced consumer representation. In advising SCV on the scope of the review, t he independent expert advisory panel recommended SCV includ e both a public and p ractitioner consultation , and a systematic review of evidence to inform overall findings and the development of evidence -based recommendations. Section 12 3 of National Law restricts the practice of spinal manipulation to four health professions : chiropractic, osteopathy, medical and ph ysiotherapy. Based on the events that triggered the review , the recommendations are necessarily focused o n the chiropractic profession. H owever, it was clear from the outset that findings related to the technique , as defined in Section 123 of National Law , would likely have implications for the other three professions permitted to perform spinal manipulation in children. SCV noted that the findings of this review could potentially have a significant impact on the scope of practice of chiropract ors, osteopaths, physiotherapists, and medical practitioners. Further, given the widespread interest in the review and it was noted that review findings may attract the attention of overseas regulators . To adequately consider the safety and efficacy of spinal manipulation in children , the early meetings of the panel focused on agreeing the following parameters : chiropractic practices or adjustments considered in scope conditions typically treated by the identified practices age ranges or groupings aligned to the relevant practices . SCV commissioned Cochrane Australia to undertake a systematic review of the safety and effectiveness of spinal manipulation on children under 12 years for any condition or symptom. For the purpose o f collecting all relevant evidence, irrespective of profession, the panel agreed to the definition of spinal manipulation as any technique delivered by any health professional that involves a high velocity, low amplitude (HVLA) thrust beyond the physiologi cal range of motion, impacting the spine, within the limits of anatomical integrity . Using a definition so closely aligned to that detailed in Section 123 of National Law allowed SCV to align findings to the current legislative position and ensure that an y recommendations did not contradict existing legislation . By defining the scope of the review to a technique , it also ensured that evidence searches related to other practitioner groups performing the technique (as defined) were with in scope for consideration. 12 Safer Care Victoria Chiropractic spinal manipulation of children under 12 However, t here was a downside to so tightly defining the technique of spinal manipulation that was within scope. This means that studies were ex cluded where the author did not provide sufficient detail to confirm the techniques reflected those detailed in Section 123 of National Law. The advisory panel considered this weakness in the approach but agreed that if harm existed , it would most likely a rise from the definition of spinal manipulation being used. It was also agreed by the advisory panel that the scope of the public and practitioner consultation would extend to include all chiropractic spinal care for children under 12 years. This decision was made because it was anticipated that many respondents would not be sufficiently informed to know whether their child or patient had received HVLA manipulation or other chiropractic manipulation. Further, a more general call for experiences was conside red necessary to facilitate the inclusive and diverse consultation that SCV was seeking, maximising the reach and allowing access to differing opinion s from both the public and practitioners.

Noting the extent of public interest following the announcement of this review, inviting public input was critical to capturing personal stories for consideration by the panel. The panel considered options for consulting with the public and planned the approach and scope of consultation. A public consultation expert was engaged to advise and support the panel during the planning period. With a goal to open consultation in May 2019 , the panel convene d a time -limited working group to formulat e the content on behalf of the group. The panel agreed to an online survey targeted to both the public and practitioners interested in sharing their opinions and experiences of chiropractic spinal care. The working group met on two occasions in early May and put significant thought into the sequencing, style , and response options for survey questions. Six different survey pathways were carefully developed so that participants could respond to the pathway most applicable to them. These pathways can be found in Figure 1. The surveys developed included a combination of quantitative and qualitative responses. The panel agreed to using the Victorian Government 's online engagement platform Engage.Vic as the portal for submissions. As detailed previously , the public consultation was deliberately designed to include all chiropractic spinal care provided to children under 12 years, and not just the specific technique of spinal manipulation. This was agreed by the panel to ensure that, irrespective of how a technique has been communicated to the consumer, all experiences related to chiropractic spinal care of children under 12 were welcomed and considered. This public consultation was designed to elicit the views, both supportive and unsupportive, of parents /guardians and practitioners , and to explore specific experiences. Public consultation was open from 22 May to 21 June 2019. A total of 29,599 online surve ys were submitted from across Australia. Public consultation Chiropractic spinal manipulation of children under 12 Safer CareVictoria 15 ANALYSIS OF SURVEY I NPUTS SCV engaged market research firm EY Sweeney to undertake an independent analysis of the data generated by the responses. To ensure that all responses met the public consultation validat ion criteria, and to protect the privacy of respondents as per the Privacy and Data Protection Act 2014 and Health Records Act 2001 , data cleansing was completed by SCV . Data cleansing included the removal of any duplicate response s, based on previously agreed set of rules. Multiple entries from the same person were assessed against guidance outlined in the frequently asked questions on the survey platform. For example, multiple responses from one respondent but relating to different children in their care were allowed . Practitioner survey streams requiring an AHPRA registration number were cr oss checked with registration data to confirm validity . All data sets were de -identified ahead of being transferred to EY Sweeney via a secure file transfer portal. Post data cleansing , a total of 29,054 (98%) valid survey responses remained. Figure 1 bel ow shows the total number of responses and the number of responses r emoved based on the defined data cleansing methodology. Figure 1 . Survey response number by survey stream and removal post data validation 16 Safer Care Victoria Chiropractic spinal manipulation of children under 12 EY Sweeney developed a coding methodology for th e qualitative survey data. The methodology applied is outlined below : In addition to analysis of the quantitative responses for all 24,223 valid survey s, EY coded the qualitative responses for 6000 survey participants . This was considered sufficient to reach saturation of content themes without risk of the analysis being unreliable. To ensure that coverage of all six survey pathways was achieved, it was agreed to divide the selection of the 6000 surveys for coding of qualitative responses . All 2735 of 'Practitioner' survey responses across the four pathways were included and 3265 from the two pathways for 'General Public' respondents . A sample 3265 (or 10%) of the General Public responses yields an estimated margin -of-error of \u00b11.7% with a population of 26,319, at a 9 5% confidence interval. I ncreasing the coding beyond this number of responses was considered to have minimal , if any, effect on the accuracy of findings . Although EY recognises that text analysis software exists to facilitate automated c oding of open - text responses, and thus not require sampling, it was their professional advice that the risk of miscategorising of responses through such an approach was too high . Accordingly , EY manually read and coded sufficient responses to reach themati c saturation and so extract the key messages. To avoid unintended bias , 3265 General Public submissions were drawn randomly from the data set provided by SCV for coding . Where the panel felt that further clinical review of responses was required, clinician s from within SCV completed this review. However, the survey was designed to capture opinion and personal experience and was not developed to capture detailed clinical information .

Two survey pathways were made available as a part of the public consultation: Member of the public who has accessed spinal care for a child under 12 in the past 10 ye ars Member of the public who has not accessed spinal care for a child under 12 in the past 10 years The distribution of responses from across Australia are shown in Figure 2 below. Figure 2. Location of responses from all general public surveys The submissions from public respondents who had accessed chiropractic spinal care for a child w ere overwhelmingly positive . Of the 21,824 respondents, 21, 750 (99.7%) were supportive of the care received . Age of children A little over half of the respondents , 54.5% (11,894) , who ha d accessed care in the past 10 years reported that the care was provided to a child aged 0 -3 months. Three quarters - 73.1% (15,953) - of respondents indicated that the care was provided was for a child aged 2 years or younger. Half of the respondents (10,934) indicated that they accessed spinal care for a child over a continuous period (across multiple age brackets). 18 Safer Care Victoria Chiropractic spinal manipulation of children under 12 Conditions for which care was being sought For members of the public who have accessed care in the past 10 years, the main reasons for seeking chiropractic spinal care were posture concerns (31.7%), colic (28.7%), neck pain (23.5%) included general health and wellbeing/preventative care (17.4%) and sleep issues (4.1%). Other care providers Of those who accessed spinal care for a child , 68.9% (12,142 from a data set of 17,622 responses) reported tha t they had also consulted a General Practitioner about the problem. Two in five , 43.9% (7,736 from a data set of 17,622 responses), respondents reported that they also consulted a Maternal and Child Health Nurse. Parent /guardian reported outcomes 63.0% (1400 of 2223 ) of respondents reported that the chiropractic care was effective in treating children under 12 years of age. 87.3% (19,052 of 21,824 responses ) indicate d that the child was 'much improved' after treatment. A further 11.1% (2,422 of 21,824 responses ) state d was 'somewhat improved'. 45.1% (705 of 1,563 responses) of respondents who accessed care report ed that they felt the chiropractor had ade quately explained the treatments and that they had felt informed during the process. 23.0% (359 of 1563 responses) state d that they valued the two-way communication when interacting with the chiropractor and felt that they were listened to . 99.1% (21,628 of 21,824 ) of respondents indicated that they were either 'satisfied' or 'very satisfied' with information provided by the chiropractor about the benefits of treatment. Similarly, 95.8% (20,907 of 21,824 ) of respondents indicated that they were 'satisfied' or 'very satisfied' with information provided about the risks of the treatment. When members of the public who had accessed chiropractic care for their child responded about why this review was important to them , it was very clear that they strongly valued the freedom of parental choice when it came to choosing the care they believed most suited to their family. 31.3% (696 out of 2223) emphasised that a parent /guardian should have the right to choose the care they feel is most appropriate for their child. 26.6% (591 out of 2223) expressed the view that chiropractic care should not be banned. There was a very small minority of respon dents - 0.3% (74 of 21,824 responses ) - within th e General Public group who reported negative experiences . The panel felt that it was important to review each of those 74 responses to screen for evidence of any potential harm . These were reviewed in detail by a senior clinician within SCV . There were no responses that we re suggestive of any significant adverse effects following chiropractic care. Instead, the negative experiences related to concerns about the cost of treatment with no resultant improvement in the condition being treated , excessive use of X-rays , or practi tioner pressure to avoid medications or advice previously provided by other health practitioners. Chiropractic spinal manipulation of children under 12 Safer CareVictoria 19 SUMMARY OF PRACTITIONER RESPONSE S The full EY Sweeney report is provided in Appendix B. Detailed here are summary findings. Four survey pathways were made available to practitioners : Practitioner who has provided spinal care for a child under 12 in the past three years Practitioner who has not provided spinal care for a child under 12 in the past three years. However, has provided care for a child who has received spinal care from another practitioner Practitioner who has not provided spinal care for a child under 12 in the past three years Practitioner who would prefer not to provide their Australian Health Practitioner Regulation Agency (AHPRA) n umber . Figure 3. Location of responses from all practitioner surveys The overwhelming majority - 99.5% (2303 of 2315) - of practitioners who responded as having provided spinal care to a child under 12 with in the past three years were registered chiropractors. Of the practitioner respondents who have provided care (essentially chiropractors) , 80.8% (1871 of 2315) reported t reating 0 -3 months and 88.5% (2049 of 2315) reported treating children aged 0 - 24 months. 20 Safer Care Victoria Chiropractic spinal manipulation of children under 12 Practitioner reported outcomes Drawn from all 2315 responses from practitioners who have provided care , the top five benefits reported, in order of mo st prevalent, were : relief from pain, better sleep quality, more relaxed or settled child, able to feed and latch better , and improved mobility or range of motion . In contrast to those practitioners who had provided spinal care , almost half - 47.6% (40 of 84) - of the practitioners who had provided care to a child who had previously received spinal care from another practitioner , reported that the spinal care had had no benefits . Reports of adverse effects 63.0% (1458 of 2315) of practitioners providing care report ed that no adverse effects related to chiropractic spinal care had been observed or reported . 13.0% (301 of 2315) of responses indicat ed that mild short -term soreness had been observed or reported. Thirteen practitioners who responded as having provided care to a child who had previously received spinal care from another practitioner noted concern about the risk of delayed access to what the responding practitioner viewed as being appropriate care as a result of seeking s pinal care . Freedom of choice A small proportion - 7.7% (124 of 1606 responses) - of the practitioners providing care mentioned the importance of the rights of parents /guardians to choose care for their child . The concept of the zone of parental /guardian discretion was considered during panel deliberations. This refers to the zone of parental /guardian choices; to either choose to refuse treatment or choose treatment that may be at odds with what their medical practitioner advises. The choice for a parent /guardian to have a HVLA spinal manipulation technique applied to their child was tested by the panel with specific consideration to both potential harm and effectiveness. Several panel members felt that as long as the parent /guardian had clear decision -making capacity and authority, was provided with sufficient information and opportunity to understand the evidence underlying the risks, benefits and alternatives that may be available, they should be allowed to make this choice .

Chiropractic spinal manipulation of children under 12 Safer CareVictoria 21 SUBMISSIONS FROM PRO FESSIONAL AND LEARNE D ORGANISATION S In addition to the online survey, SCV invited professional and learned organisations with an interest in this review to make a written submission for the panel to consider. Nineteen submissions were r eceived from organisations . It is worth noting that the organisation submissions primarily related to chiropractic spinal care of children in general rather than to only the specific high velocity, low amplitude technique. The responses received provided representative perspectives from across all professions permitted to perform spinal manipulation as defined in Section 123 of National Law. The panel reviewed all submissions. T hree key themes were apparent : evidence education safety/harm. As the statutory regulator for the chiropractic profession , the Board provided an outline of its statutory functions and responsibilities. The Board has demonstrated a willingness to respond, with the provision of strengthened guidance to chiropractors, when issues of concern are raised. Evidence Irrespective of the varying views noted by membership organisations and associations representative of chiropractic and other relevant professions , it was widely acknowledged that there is a n urgent need to improve the evidence base for chiropractic practices and to develop best -practice guidelines. Specifica lly, it was widely agreed that there was insufficient evidence to appropriately guide clinical care. Below is an excerpt from the submission made by the Austr alian Chiropractors Association , reportedly the largest chiropractic body in Australia, representi ng more than 3000 members : In keeping with the National Scheme and to ensure public benefit, the Australian Chiropractors Association (ACA) proposes the following: That the profession conducts a trial of monitoring of care including outcomes of children under 12 years of age That the profession continues to further refine industry -led standards and clinical guidelines informed by best practice. This would include continuing professional development and consensus approaches to care including inter -profession al understanding and action That the profession continues to further commit to expanding knowledge translation from research into clinical practice within the industry That the profession and health research agencies increase support for further research into chiropractors and their role in the healthcare of children.9 9 World Federation of Chiropractic: Australian Chiropractors Association Publishes Submission to Safer Car e Victoria Independent Review into Chiropractic Spine Care For Children (https://www.wfc.org/website/index.php?option=com_content&view=category&layout=blog&id=56&Itemid=164&lang=en ) 22 Safer Care Victoria Chiropractic spinal manipulation of children under 12 Education There is currently no requirement for specialist training in paediatric chiropractic care. The Council on Chiropractic Education Australasia review s and provides accreditation of pre -registration chiropractic education. The chiropractic profession does not have agreed and accredited specialist path ways, as exist in the medical profession. However , while not mandatory for practice, advanced post graduate training courses do exist and are generally considered useful in enhancing the knowledge and skills of th e chiropractor workforce in specific interest areas , such as in paediatric care . Such practitioner development and training is currently offered by several different bodies. There does not appear to be any formal accreditation process or best -practice guid elines to ensure consistency across the post registration training offered. The Council on Chiropractic Education Australasia submission states : \"All accredited chiropractic programs include education in such areas as the health, developmental stages, comm on conditions and treatment, co management and referral options for children under (and over) the age of 12 years. \" Submissions received from three tertiary institutions referenced a desire for further research to support development of industry -led standa rds and guidelines. It was recommended within two of those submissions tha t once guidelines are developed, standardised post -graduate paediatric training for the chiropractic profession is likely to facilitate improved health outcomes. The views expressed by the tertiary institutions was echoed in the position presented by Chiropractic Australia , a membership -based organisation supporting the profession. Chiropractic Australia 's submission to this review states: \" For those chiropractors who wish to offer a more focused paediatric practice, that is for those who wish to practice paediatric chiropractic as a special interest, we believe that additional accreditation and training standards should be in place and that training for endorsed pa ediatric practice must be undertaken under the auspices of universities .\" Safety/harm Submissions made by bodies representative of the medical or physiotherapy professions raised concerns related to the potential harm of chiropractic spinal manipulation on children under 12 years. In particular, there was specific concern about potential risks of harm associated with spinal manipulation of very young children, i.e. those under 2 years of age. However, no specific or confirmed instances of proven harm were presented in any submission. Nonetheless , it was the professional view of those groups that in the absence of evidence of benefit , the risks of harm were sufficient to recommend banning chiropractic spinal manipulation of children .Chiropractic spinal manipulation of children under 12 Safer CareVictoria 23 In assessing the divers e views presented within the submissions, the panel agreed on the need for investment in properly conducted research , preferably in Australia, and the value that such research would provide the profession in quantifying both effectiveness and safety . During the first panel meeting on 8 April 2019, it was agreed that Cochrane Australia would be engaged to undertake an appraisal of the evidence for both the safety and effectiveness of spinal manipulation on children under 12 years of age . Spinal manipulation was defined by the experts on the panel as being any technique delivered by any health professional that involves a high velocity, low amplitude thrust beyond the physiological range of motion, impacting the spine, within the limits of anatomical integrity . The literature search captured studies referring to children under 12 years of age, including babies and infants, treated with spinal manipulation from any healthcare professi onal for any condition or indication. If studies included adolescents or adults, in addition to children, and it was impossible to extract data separately for children, the studies were included provided most participants were under 12 years or the mean ag e of participants was less than 12. Cochrane identified e xisting, high -quality systematic reviews that had assessed the evidence for spinal manipulation on children. To avoid unnecessary duplication, Cochrane identified the subset of evidence on the effec tiveness and safety of spinal manipulation on children from these existing reviews, and included relevant studies published before or after their completed search dates. The full systematic review report prepared by Cochrane Australia can be found in Appen dix C of this report. Systematic review of literature for evidence of effectiveness and safety 24 Safer Care Victoria Chiropractic spinal manipulation of children under 12 EFFECTIVENESS REVIEW Thirteen studies (including 11 randomised trials) were considered in scope for the effectiveness review. There we re no Australian -based studies. The majority of studies included were undertaken in the USA or Europe. Nine of the included studies were based on chiropractic practitioners performing spinal manipulation as defined . The conditions covered in those studies included colic (three studies), enuresis, back/neck pain, headache, a sthma (two studies), otitis media, cerebral palsy, hyperactivity (two studies) and torticollis . Overall, there was very little evidence to support the use of spinal manipulation for any of the conditions studied. For the majority of the conditions , the evidence showed there was no benefit. However, for two conditions - infant colic and enuresis (bed wetting) - there was uncertainty . The following is an excerpt from the Cochrane Systematic Review report: Based on meta -analysis of three studies, Cochrane found low certainty evidence that, in infants with colic, mean crying time may be reduced among inf ants who received spinal manipulation compared to a control (sham, no treatment, active comparator) (0.71 hours (43 minutes) per day lower, 95% CI 1.87 (112 minutes) lower to 0.46 (28 minutes) higher; 3 trials, 156 infants). However, the confidence interva l is wide and includes a possible increase in crying time. Cochrane also found low certainty evidence that the mean number of wet nights may be reduced among children with enuresis who received spinal manipulative therapy compared to sham spinal manipulati ve therapy (1.6 fewer wet nights per fortnight, 95% CI 3.2 fewer to 0 more; 1 trial, 57 participants). However, the confidence interval is wide and includes the possibility of no effect. For other conditions there was either no evidence of effect, or no da ta available from which to draw a conclusion.10 When presented with the findings from Cochrane's systematic review, the panel discussed the absence of strong evidence for chiropractic spinal manipulation. The consumer representatives were particularly surprised at the lack of evidence. The panel also requested advice from Cochrane on the design of potential future research. Cochrane shared the following suggestions as key considerations when designing studies: Providing detail and clarity of the intervention being studied or applied Ensuring studies are adequately powered (appropriate sample size) Developing core outcome measures, that can preferably be compared against other or future studies. 10 Cochrane Australia : Systematic Review of Spinal Manipulation in Children , August 2019 . See Appendix BChiropractic spinal manipulation of children under 12 Safer CareVictoria 25 SAFETY REVIEW Interpretation of the safet y findings was informed by the acknowledgement that b est practice care requires a modification of force based on the age and developmental stage of a child. The panel advised SCV that Australian chiropractors are trained with that specific awareness and in corporate it into their daily practice. Based on the parameters defined by the panel, Cochrane identified 10 studies for inclusion in the safety component of the literature review. Studies were included from around the world based on intervention descript ion, agnostic of practitioner type . Across all 10 studies there was a total of 159 adverse effects noted. Only one study had been based in Australia . It reported two adverse events from a treatment population of 171. The following is an excerpt from the Cochrane Systematic Review report: Six of these studies aimed to determine the rate s of adverse event s occurring across populatio ns of infants and childre n undergoing spinal manipulative therapy. These studies reported rates spanning one minor treatment aggravatio n pe r 1812 consultatio ns to one cerebrovascular incident in 20,000 visits. Two related studies investigated physiological responses to spina l manipulatio n in childre n and reporte d apnoea and skin flushing in 50 of 199 treate d infants; and in a separate study, severe but short-lasting bradycardia i n almost 50% of infants less tha n three months o ld, and i n 87 of 695 childre n over fou r months. Four studie s described five individual case s of adverse effects from spinal manipulative therapy in infants or children. Of these, three were classified as severe and two as moderate. Of the three repo rts of a serious adverse event, one resulted in death. The technique employe d in this case was describe d as the Vojta technique and involved forced active rotatio n and hea d retraction performed by a physiotherapist (case report from Germany in 2001). Other serious adverse events were loss of consciousness with recovery and hospitalisatio n for drowsiness and weakne ss. Though the prevalence of adverse outcomes is very low, the risk cannot be ignored. Any risk associated with care provided must be considered on balance with potential benefits.11 In summary, the revie w of the literature revealed that the potentia l risk of harm from spin al manipulatio n in childre n was rare and, when it did occur, was typically minor i n severity. However, as reported by Cochrane, \"consistent with the findings of other systemati c reviews, due to the pau city of studies and the lack of reported information on the specific treatment techniques employed, it is difficult to draw conclusions about the safety and effectiveness of spinal manipulation in children.\" 11 Cochrane Australia : Systematic Review of Spinal Manipulation in Children , August 2019 . See Appendix B26 Safer Care Victoria Chiropractic spinal manipulation of children under 12 ADDITIONAL E VIDENCE COLLECTED In addition to the systematic review of literature, SCV also requested information from AHPRA, the Health Complaints Commission er (Victoria ), the Office of the Health Ombudsman (QLD), and relevant profession -based councils in New South Wales . Notifications and complaints data AHPRA undertook a search of available information in its notifications database. The data reflected notificati ons that AHPRA ha d received relating to chiropractic spinal care for children under 12 over the past 10 years. Below is a summary of the notifications data: Nineteen notifications about 18 practitioners Four notifications remain open One matter was ret ained by the health complaints entity to manage (not referred to AHPRA) Six notifications resulted in no further action Eight matters were acted on by the Board. Of the 15 investigations completed to date, the Chiropractic Board of Australia took furthe r action in 53.3% of cases. Action s taken included issuing a caution, p lacing conditions o n a practitioner's registration, and t he practitioner providing an undertaking to the Board. AHPRA does not manage all notifications or complaints made about health practitioners in Australia. In NSW, notifications are managed by 15 professional councils (supported by the Health Professional Councils Authority) and the Health Care Complaints Commission (HCCC). The Health Care Complaints Commission identified three ca ses related to chiropractic spinal manipulation of a child under 12 years. There was a discrepancy noted between the data held by the Chiropractic Council of NSW and the HCCC. The discrepancy has been actioned for investigation. In Queensland, the Office of the Health Ombudsman (OHO) receives all complaints about health practitioners and determines which of those complaints are referred to a National Board/AHPRA to manage. The Office of the Health Ombudsman reported that since its inception on 1 July 2014 it has not received any complaints relating to spinal manipulation of children under 12 years. The Victorian Health Complaints Commission er (HCC) reported no complaints against a chiropractor related to the treatment of a child. The details of complaints a nd notifications were considered by the panel. There were no complaints or notifications that re lated to significant harm to a child as a result of chiropractic spinal manipulation. The only issue that was of concern to the panel was the discrepancy between data sets. A ccurate reporting on a national level is wholly r eliant on consistency in the capture, coding and management of data. The relevant bodies are exploring the apparent data inconsistencies. Chiropractic spinal manipulation of children under 12 Safer CareVictoria 27 Insurance claims SCV reques ted de -identified data from the principal insurance agencies that provi de insurance for chiropractors. Information was sought regarding any c laims made in relat ion to chiropractic spinal manipulation of a child under 12 years. No cases were reported where an insurance agent has had to defend or settle such a claim. 28 Safer Care Victoria Chiropractic spinal manipulation of children under 12 This review would not have been possible without the assistance of the advisory panel members: Professor Euan Wallace AM Panel Chair , Chief Executive Officer, Safer Care Victoria Dr Alison Wray Paediatric Neurosurgeon, Royal Children's Hospital Professor Andrew Wilson Chief Medical Officer, Safer Care Victoria David Harding Physiotherapist, Paediatric Orthopaedic Clinic, Monash Children's Hospital Adj.

The Victorian Minister for Health , Jenny Mikakos MP, has a sked Safer Care Victoria (SCV) to lead an independent review of the practice of spinal manipulation on children under 12 years, and for the findings of that review to be provided to her for reporting to the COAG Health Council, including any need for chang es to the national law. 1. AIMS OF THE REVIEW To examine and assess the available evidence, including information from consumers, providers, and other stakeholders, for the use of spinal manipulation by chiropractors on children less than 12 years of age. To provide recommendations regarding this practice to the Victorian Minister for Health. 2. PROPOSED TIMELINE It is expected that SCV will deliver a final report and recommendations within six months from commencement. 3. REVIEW METHODOLOGY SCV will establish a panel that will be responsible for reviewing the available evidence and public submissions. The review will consist of two principal elements: (a) A systematic review of the literature. (b) A call for public written submissions. The panel will work collaboratively and use the systematic review and the evidence gathered from written submission s to inform SCV 's final report and recommendations. SCV will deliver the final report and recommendations to the Victorian Minister for Health. 2 4. PANEL RESPONSIBILITIES The panel will be a time -limited function of SCV . The C hief Executive Officer (CEO) of SCV will chair the review. Role of the panel The panel will advise on the review, enabling SCV to provide recommendations to the Victorian Minister fo r Health. Specifically, the panel will: work collaboratively to develop and endorse the scope of this review, set the parameters for the literature searches and systematic review, determine the questions to be asked that will frame the call for public wr itten submissions, use all evidence gathered to inform SCV 's final recommendations. Operating principles Advice provided by the panel should be guided by the following key principles: reflects a person -centred approach to care, with an emphasis on supp orting and empowering people to achieve their maximum health potential , has a key focus on the provision of high -quality health care delivery and improving health outcomes through consideration of a 'system -wide' approach , promotes a culture of continuous improvement through evidence -informed decision making is inclusive and collaborative in providing advice and respectful of diverse opinions, with all members having an equal voice , provides timely, independent and constru ctive advice based on 'on -the-ground' experience that translates into practical recommendations. 5. PANEL MEMBERSHIP Panel membership will include experts in healthcare evidence, governance, paediatrics, and in musculoskeletal care, and consumer represen tation. It is expected that panel membership will include, but not necessarily limited to, consumers, medical practitioners, allied health practitioners, and the relevant regulator agency, A ustralian Health Practitioner Regulation Agency . All members will use the breadth and depth of their knowledge, skills and experience to inform the work of the panel.

All Rights Reserved. Liability limited by a scheme approved under Professional Standards Legislation 30553. -Safer Care Victoria -Review of Chiropractic Care -Final Report -13AUG2019On 8 March 2019, the Commonwealth of Australian Governments (COAG) Health Council noted community concerns regarding spinal manipulation on children performed by chiropractors. The Victorian Minister for Health, Jenny Mikakos MP, asked Safer Care Victoria (SCV) to lead an independent review of the practice of spinal manipulation on children under 12 years and for the findings of that review to be provided for reporting to the COAG Health Council. Public consultation to gather opinions and experience of chiropractic spinal care commenced on the 22 May 2019 and closed on 21 June 2019 on Engage Victoria (https://engage.vic.gov.au/chiropractic -spinal -care - children -review ) A large response (29,599 completions) was received. Six survey streams were made available as a part of the public consultation. 1. Member of the public who has accessed care in past 10 years. 2. Member of the public who has not accessed care in the past 10 years. 3. Practitioner who has provided care in the past three years. 4. Practitioner who has not provided spinal care in the past three years. However, has provided care for a child who has received spinal care.5. Practitioner who has not provided spinal care for a child under 12 in the past three years. 6. Practitioner who would prefer not to provide their Australian Health Practitioner Regulation Agency (AHPRA) number. The survey questionnaires included a combination of quantitative and qualitative responses to gather the experience and opinion of the Australian public. The survey was designed and deployed by the independent panel established by Safer Care Victoria. On 28 June 2019, EY Sweeney was commissioned to provide data analytics support to ensure robust, independent, non -biased analysis of public consultation responses. This document reports the findings from this research analysis.Background Page 6\u00a9 2019 Ernst & Young. All Rights Reserved. Liability limited by a scheme approved under Professional Standards Legislation 30553. -Safer Care Victoria -Review of Chiropractic Care -Final Report -13AUG2019Research methodology -Overview Questionnaire design The six survey questionnaires that were used to complete this study were developed by the independent panel established by Safer Care Victoria to review the chiropractic practice of spinal manipulation on children under 12. The panel includes experts in paediatrics and musculoskeletal care, consumers, and representatives from the Chiropractic Board of Australia and Australian Chiropractors Association. Further details about the independent panel can be found here: https://www.bettersafercare.vic.gov.au/our - work/governance -and-information/independent - review -chiropractic -manipulation . From a methodological perspective, there were three broad components to completing this study: questionnaire design, survey d atacollection, and analysis and reporting. Survey data collection The six survey questionnaires were programmed and hosted using the Engage Victoria web -platform, allowing them to be accessed by the public. Engage Victoria is the Victorian Government's Online Consultation platform. The process of collecting the survey data for this study was managed by Safer Care Victoria and the independent panel. Further details about Engage Victoria can be found here: https://engage.vic.gov.au/aboutAnalysis and reporting EY Sweeney was engaged to conduct an independent analysis of the data collected by the six survey streams and report the findings to the independent review panel. The following pages describe the data analysis methodology applied to responses collected and which were used to generate the findings described within this report. Further details about EY Sweeney can be found here: https://eysweeney.com.au/ Detail across the methodology for the data analysis and reporting that was conducted by EY Sweeney follows over the coming pa ges.Page 7\u00a9 2019 Ernst & Young.

Duplicate removal A merged version of the complete dataset was checked for duplicate email entries. Responses submitted across public and practitioner survey streams were accepted as per the Frequently Asked Questions published on Engage Victoria : https://engage.vic.gov.au/chiropractic -spinal - care -children -review I am a practitioner and a parent -which survey should I answer? We have options to answer as a member of the public and a practitioner. You are welcome to answer both or either surveys.This section outlines the approach to data handling and processing. Content for duplicate email submissions in public surveys were reviewed to assess whether multiple entries represented different children or were submitted by different family members. If responses submitted by different family members, both entries were retained. If responses submitted by same person, and different experiences were represented, all entries were retained. If responses submitted by same person, and experiences were identical, only primary entry was retained and subsequent submissions were removed. Where practitioners submitted a response in an AHPRA identifiable survey and in the no AHPRA provided survey, the no AHPRA number provided response was removed. Where practitioner submitted across all three AHPRA identifiable surveys, the primary response was retained. Where practitioner submitted multiple entries within one survey stream, the primary entry was retained. Page 8\u00a9 2019 Ernst & Young. All Rights Reserved. Liability limited by a scheme approved under Professional Standards Legislation 30553. -Safer Care Victoria -Review of Chiropractic Care -Final Report -13AUG2019Australian Health Practitioner Regulation Agency provider number validation Practitioner responses were reviewed to identify where AHPRA number was incomplete or had incorrect formatting. If practitioner name was identified on the AHPRA register, the AHPRA number was amended and submission included in analysis. If an AHPRA number could not be found to match a practitioner name then the submission was removed from the dataset. De-identification All identifiable information collected (name, email, IP address, full AHPRA number) were removed by Safer Care Victoria. AHPRA practitioner prefix was retained in data submission to EY. EY completed a further data match to valid Australian postcodes and removed responses submitted with non -Australian postcodes. 1.2 Data transfer Once the data was prepared, EY provided a link to the firm's secure file transfer service, known as Media Shuttle, which SCV used to transfer the cleaned survey data to EY. Media Shuttle is a product provided by Signiant and used by many of the largest corporations in the world. More details are available on Signiant's website ( https://www.signiant.com ) Confirmation was provided upon receipt of data. All data was stored on EY's secure South Melbourne servers. No data was copied onto personal devices. At the conclusion of the project, all data will be permanently deleted. 1.3 Data security EY's data security practices are audited every year to ensure they are compliant with the standard set -forth in ISO 20252, which is the most stringent accreditation for market research firms in Australia.1.4 Data preparation Once the data was received, it was passed to EY's team of data analysts who completed two initial tasks: 1) They converted the quantitative data into a SPSS file format, which facilitated the subsequent analyses. SPSS is a software package provided by IBM which facilitates advanced statistical analysis. It is one of the most commonly used file formats for data analysis. More details about IBM SPSS are available on their website (https://www.ibm.com/au - en/analytics/spss -statistics -software ) 2) They prepared the open -text data in a format that facilitated the coding process. When these tasks were completed, EY began coding the open -text data and completing the quantitative analysis. The analysis of the qualitative data is explored in more detail in section 2.1.Page 9\u00a9 2019 Ernst & Young. All Rights Reserved.

Liability limited by a scheme approved under Professional Standards Legislation 30553. -Safer Care Victoria -Review of Chiropractic Care -Final Report -13AUG20192.1 Allocation of coding resources EY's coding methodology is as follows. In addition analysis of the eight closed question responses for all 24,223 valid survey participants asked closed questions, EY coded the open -ended question responses for 6,000 survey participants. This is a sufficient number of responses to analyse without risk of the analysis being unreliable. To ensure that coverage of all six survey pathways is achieved, EY and SCV agreed to divide the selection of the 6,000 surveys for coding of open -ended responses with 2,735 allocated to the four 'Practitioner' surveys and 3,265 allocated to the two 'General Public' surveys. This means that all of the Practitioner responses were included in the analysis of open -ended question responses and approximately 10% of the General Public open ended question responses were analysed. As mentioned, all pre -coded question responses were included in the analysis. A sample 3,265 (or 10%) of the General Public responses yields an estimated margin -of-error of \u00b11.7% with a population of 26,319, at a 95%Research methodology -Open text coding confidence interval. Due to the law of diminishing returns, increasing the coding above this point would only have a minimal effect on the accuracy of findings (for example, a sample size of 10,000 would only improve the predicted margin -of-error by >1%). However, it would require considerable additional investment in time and funds. Although EY recognises that text analysis software exists to facilitate automated coding of open -text responses, and thus not require sampling, it is our professional opinion that the risk of miscategorising of responses through such an approach is too high, given the stringent requirements of this project. To avoid bias occurring, 3,265 General Public submissions coded were drawn randomly from the data set provided by SCV. 2.2 Codeframe development EY's in -house coding team conducted a preliminary review of the open -text responses allocated for coding. As they read through, they noted the themes of sentiment that emerged from the responses. This list of themes formed the codeframe that was used to facilitate the qualitative analysis and reporting.A code frame is a list of themes with an identifying code number allocated to each individual theme. In the coding process, a coder will read an open -text response and mark down the themes within it by entering the numbers that correspond to the relevant codes in the codeframe . All codeframes were provided to SCV for approval, to ensure that the language used to describe themes is clear and fit for purpose. 2.3 Coding process As described in section 2.2, the coding process is a manual one. A team of EY Coders read through open -text responses and manually typed the numbers (codes) that indicated the relevant themes within the response. The coding framework developed also had specific guidance around flagging the following type of responses: Check if references to accessing care are within a 10 year time frame; Check if references to providing care are within a 3 year time frame;Page 11\u00a9 2019 Ernst & Young. All Rights Reserved. Liability limited by a scheme approved under Professional Standards Legislation 30553. -Safer Care Victoria -Review of Chiropractic Care -Final Report -13AUG2019Indicate sentiment as supportive of chiropractic care or unsupportive of chiropractic care for children; Flag where duplication of responses is found across content. None were identified in the coding process; Flag comments that outline impact of restriction of care; Flag comments that identify safety issues or adverse events relating to chiropractic care. Three responses were identified. Through -out the report percentages are rounded to zero decimal places. When adding multiple percentages together, total may be one percentage point different due to round. Open -text responses frequently contain more than one key theme, thus proportions reported for coded questions will add to greater than 100%. Page 12\u00a9 2019 Ernst & Young. All Rights Reserved.

They have all thrived and are rarely sick. It helped with colic when babies and now with all the bumps and bangs that happens with kids. Chiropractic changed my son's life and got him off medications that changed him for the worse.We went to see a chiro due to our children all having tongue ties released before 6 months of age. My twins were around a month old at the time. As they grow, I consider regular chiropractic checks to be part of our family health regime - just like regular medical and dental checks, I consider it setting a strong foundation for their future health. Our chiropractors have looked after our children since birth -initially for check up after birth . now we have a check up for the kids if they have bumps or tumbles .Chiropractor was informative / knowledgeable My chiropractor is amazing and goes above and beyond for me & my family. She's extremely professional in everything she does and has always given me more information than my family GP. I was very impressed with the amount of information my chiropractor and the clinic provided with me before, during and after the care of my young son. I have always felt very well informed in regards to care. The information I have received has only made me feel more confident that chiropractic care is right for my family.Page 28\u00a9 2019 Ernst & Young. All Rights Reserved.

Before every adjustment, the chiropractor first talks to me and the child, and takes time to \"connect\" in a friendly way with the child. The chiropractor will then ask me and the child in turn about any concerns, any changes since our last visit, and then physically examine the child.My chiropractor always gave me lots of options and great advice that the GP or maternal health nurse did not give. They also really cared for my mental and physical health as well. As per above, the upfront honesty and openness regarding the treatment was a lot more than we ever received from GP etc. Much more care and time was taken. We were involved all the way and given options. I felt more cared for than i ever have at a doctor or specialist medical doctor.Two-way communication / consent was present / was listened to All alternatives were discussed and we had a full assessment and 'chat' about the treatment plan. Extremely satisfied. At the beginning of each consult I explained my concerns, they were listened to, I was involved and present for each step and always felt free to voice if I was not comfortable with what was happening. I was fully involved during the whole process, and the chiropractic explained what he was going to do each step of the way and asked if I was ok with what he was about to do.

He was recently discharged by the paediatric gastroenterologist, the ENT surgeon said that surgery wasn't necessary and the sleep doctors remained perplexed by my son's radical recovery of his health problems from chiropractic treatments.Improved behavioural issues / less stressed / relaxed / stop crying / settled We noticed a change in the child's wellbeing straight away, with symptoms for issues reducing dramatically. When seeking care for Colic the improvement was immediate. The chiropractor also showed me a simple massage technique to assist with moving the build up of wind.His overall wellness improved after each visit; better digestion, more frequent bowel movements, less clicking in his hips, less screaming overall. My children would all improve after a visit. They were less irritable, slept better and were able to manoeuvre themselves more freely! Each of our boys feels better after adjustments. They always sleep better after an adjustment & mood is improved.Improved sleep / no longer bedwetting Slept better, had bowel movements if constipated. Crawling/moving better. More content child. Always has a deep 3 hour nap after his adjustment. I see total peace in my son after an adjustment. Our baby has had regular chiro treatments since birth and has had no issues with sleep, feeding, settling etc.Page 34\u00a9 2019 Ernst & Young. All Rights Reserved.

Liability limited by a scheme approved under Professional Standards Legislation 30553. -Safer Care Victoria -Review of Chiropractic Care -Final Report -13AUG2019Sample Verbatim Comments: Chiropractic care is beneficial / effective /research has proved the benefits of chiropractic care I believe spinal health is extremely important to our wellbeing. I myself had miraculous results as a child from Chiropractic care when all Medical intervention had failed me... It is so much easier to correct issues when young than to wait until we have degenerative issues leading to chronic disease.Keep chiropractic care accessible / available / should not be banned or restricted Because we should not be dictated to about whether we use natural and preventative care for our own families. Chiropractic care is safer than medical care -the research proves this. This is not to say I don't or wouldn't use mainstream medicine because I do when I have to. I believe a integrated approach where we can the use the most appropriate care in the most appropriate situation benefits everyone. Because I believe it's very important to keep children's chiropractic going. I can't imagine what my options would have been for my daughter if it wasn't available, as I have stated her neck was significantly visibly bent!Because it is important that we all have the opportunity to access allied healthcare and treatment for our children. Just because one person didn't seem to be doing the right thing doesn't mean that the whole industry and patients need to suffer, and have our rights/choices taken away. Given that Chiropractic care is so pivotal to the safe support and management of my children's general healthcare, I would be devastated to be in a position where I would not be able to access this care for my family. I know there are many wonderful chiropractors who are skilled in working with children and have seen great results. I personally know young children who have been treated and healed by chiropractors for severe problems that no other health practitioner could help with. It would be shameful to deny our children the treatment that could give them the quality life they deserve.Parents should have the right to choose the health care for their children I would feel saddened and angry if my right to get any of my children checked at a chiropractor was removed, or came with conditions attached. I trust my own judgement about my own children, and I trust my ability to choose an ethical, professional chiropractor who I trust with helping to care for my child. The decision should not be made for us. I couldn't imagine my children not being able to receive Chiropractic care!! Because I don't need the government interfering. It's what my child needed at the time and my job as parent was to make that decision...they only thing the government should be doing is making it available to be bulk billed.Page 36\u00a9 2019 Ernst & Young.

If Chiropractic care becomes unavailable for my child in Australia, I will take my child to New Zealand if necessary.Chiropractic care helped my child or family / Chiropractic care helped me I hate this unsubstantiated scaremongering regarding something that works, can help siblings and parents by having a settled easy baby. This form of care has been around a long time and has been proven to be helpful and safe compared with many other interventions performed regularly by GP s and other health professionals. I have seen a forceps delivery and had one and the forces on the spine are a lot greater than any Chiropractic treatment.All 3 of my kids have been receiving weekly Chiropractic care since they were 3 months old. They are extremely well developed, very rarely sick and have excellent immune systems. They are strong, confident and healthy kids. Due to the chiropractic care my son received as a child and still at 19 years of age, he has chosen to pursue this as his career. He has found the benefits to far outweigh any negatives, of which, he has never suffered. We still attend our chiro as a family and look forward to our monthly adjustment. To me and my family chiropractic appointments and treatments have a huge positive effect on our life and make my children happier sleep better get less sick and make their moods so much better.Consumer choice around health should not be restricted Please don't take away our choices of providing the best possible health treatment to our kids. My daughter has also had many other issues including colic and sleep. The chiropractic treatment has helped a lot. I encourage all friends and family to seek chiropractic care for their children as the improvement was incredible. The ongoing support and guidance has proven invaluable to my experience as a first time mum. I believe it is a parents choice as to how they give care to their child and they should be allowed to choose what path to take. Parents need the right to choose their healthcare for their children. Period. So many doctors have made an incorrect diagnosis for a child, but all GPs wouldn't be banned from practicing on under 12s ? Its madness.Stream 2: Member of the public who has not accessed care in the past 10 yearsDETAILED FINDINGSPage 39\u00a9 2019 Ernst & Young. All Rights Reserved.

The training in chiropractic is second to none. Children SHOULD have the opportunity for great health through chiropractic.Non-pharmaceutical or holistic method I believe chiropractic care is essential for all children. My son had his first check at 1 week old. I am a great believer in Chiropractic care for all ages. Care of the body starts as a young person and should be continued throughout life. Preventative maintenance is far better than reactive treatment by \"doctors\" and their multitude of pills that they are more than willing to hand out. I believe chiropractic spinal care would be safe and beneficial for children under 12 years. It would be especially beneficial if the child has any kind of issue that may originate in the misalignment of the spine. I am sure there are many cases in children that could benefit from chiropractic spinal care.Isn't this better than prolonged drug use to help with pain. The drug therapy yes may dull the pain but doesn't fix the issue. It could be something like TMJD caused during the birth process, fixed quickly so the baby can be comfortable and the parents don't worry when the child isn't growing properly. I don't understand why this wonderful therapy would be made unavailable to people who believe and know it helps them. Let's be frank. The allopathic system of medicine has spent huge amounts of effort to marginalise all forms of treatment that exists outside of their cut, burn, poison model. As an adult that receives chiropractic treatments I believe that these treatments are of great value for children as well. It is an opportunity for ailments to be treated naturally which should always be the first port of call in any treatment for children especially.Choice around health should not be restricted All families deserve the right to utilise different health practices for different reasons. If we take that choice away from chiropractic, it won't be long before other professions are attacked as well and our freedom to choose becomes more restricted and limited. Parents should be able to choose if they wish to obtain chiropractic care for their children. There are techniques designed for kids under 12 some of which don't involve manipulation. It should be the right of parents to be able to choose if they want their child, no matter what age, to be seen or treated by any practitioner, be they doctor, physiotherapist, chiropractor, dentist, or whomever they wish to seek the advice or services of, especially when they are qualified to do the job they are doing!Page 42\u00a9 2019 Ernst & Young.

I think chiropractors do an amazing and very important job in preventing and relieving pain and children will suffer if this care is no longer available.Chiropractic / healthcare should be offered to everyone Chiropractic care works, it is a gentle holistic approach to overall care that avoids drugs and possibly surgery for issues that were traditionally treated with either drugs and/or surgery. I think it is important for all children, especially my grandkids to be able to access chiropractic care. My grandkids currently do see a chiropractor and have found it to be very helpful. All persons young and old need to have access to appropriate care. One size doesn't fit all. Personally I prefer chiropractic care to attending upon a physiotherapist as I get better results quickly and are sustained longer. I believe that access should be allowed to every living being and to remove an opportunity to an individual based on a minority view is unjust. If somebody doesn't like or believe in chiropractic then they don't have to participate in care, but to legally block a health care provision is barbaric. I don't think a review is required. Over reaction to a few instances is 'nanny state' thinking. Why should under 12s miss out on a well aligned skeletal structure which provides sound sleep, normal growth, and a high functioning nervous system?Parents should have the right to decide on their child / family's health We should all have the right to choose who and where we can take our families for whatever health concerns we may have. What has happened to freedom of rights. Everyone should have the option of treatment, and chiropractors are well trained professionals. One of my grandchildren would be immobile without this form of treatment. I believe that parents should be able to access chiropractic care for their children if they so desire. I am thankful that I was able to this for my children.Practitioner surveys DETAILED FINDINGSPage 45\u00a9 2019 Ernst & Young. All Rights Reserved.

All Rights Reserved.

Children are generally much more flexible than adults so it is unusual to see any post treatment strain or pain attributable to the treatment in the absence of pathology. In my experience I have not observed any adverse events, nor have the patients/parents reported any after receiving spinal care.Occasionally a few hours of irritability the first time they have their spine adjusted (using non HVLA). A few babies have been a bit grumbly and unsettled following adjustments, but no adverse events have been reported to me after more than 30 years of adjusting babies and children. Occasionally, infants I have treated have been more irritable on the day of treatment, but this settles within a day or two. This seems to be more common after their very first treatment. More often than not, however, parents have reported that their baby is more settled and with improved symmetry in their spinal movements.Mild short term soreness Temporary soreness is the only adverse events I have observed and that the patients/parents have reported. Common side effects from spinal manipulations have included short term post -treatment soreness associated with mild sprain/strain type injuries. This is a very common outcome associated with spinal manipulation, and all patients are advised of this possible outcome before commencing any form of spinal care. The only adverse effect that I have come across is mild soreness during and immediately after chiropractic care for a very short period of time. And within 5 minutes to 24 hours those symptoms are gone.Page 58\u00a9 2019 Ernst & Young. All Rights Reserved.

If chiropractic supports healing that is even partially related to some of the health improvements I have mentioned above, doesn't that mean that kids cannot be said to be really healthy without a healthy spine?Chiropractic / healthcare should be offered to everyone / no age restriction I believe that natural health care has a place in our society. Chiropractic care works very safely and effectively in helping children develop correctly and optimally. Children also experience sprains and strains and the sooner they are corrected, they will have less implications in their adult life. Seeing the changes in not only the children but the parents themselves when their child is no longer as unsettled is so rewarding and the thought of having to turn away desperate parents from being able to access treatment for their child would be heartbreaking. This is extremely important to me as I believe everybody from birth through to the elderly can benefit from Chiropractic care. As a Chiropractor I care for patients who have a wide array of history, they come to me as a Chiropractor to approach their case the best I possibly can. This review is important to me because the ability to look after the whole community is important to me, I know professionally as a Chiropractor and personally as a paediatric Chiropractic patient when I was 0-12 the importance of receiving Chiropractic care from the ages of 0 -12. The confidence parents, patients and children have in my skill set alone is more than enough to provide a positive, safe and effective health care approach to keep my community happier and healthier. It would be unfair and unjust to deny people the freedom of taking their children to a highly skilled, highly educated practitioner (chiropractor) if they wish to seek us out to maintain their health and well -being.Parents should have the right to decide on their child / family's health Parents should have the freedom to choose which health care practitioners they want for their kids and for what reason. By removing an entire modality of care for children is removing a basic right. Ensuring children have the best start to life is critical and a proactive health care approach is always more effective than allowing issues to develop in teenage years or adulthood. Healthy kids have a better chance of becoming healthy adults. As a child I have had Chiropractic care, my children receive Chiropractic care and I have personally helped hundreds of parents that came to me often as a last resort get positive results. To take away the ability for people to choose Chiropractic especially when other more conventional treatments have failed would be a huge loss in a country that enjoys such diversity and choices in all other aspects of life. This review is vital for the freedom of the public to choose their own qualified health practitioner for their families. Chiropractic is a safe, effective and non -invasive therapy that has been used for decades. Chiropractors undergo stringent training in universities, completing a Bachelor degree and a Masters degree.Page 60\u00a9 2019 Ernst & Young. All Rights Reserved.

There is no need to make a blanket ban that will prevent this segment of the population from receiving treatment. It would be so wrong.Chiropractic care is safe / lack of evidence to support harm to children or people of all ages I strongly believe that chiropractic care should remain available to all members of the public regardless of age when it is preformed by a skilled professional who modifies the technique to be age appropriate. Please do not restrict the practice of safe gentle chiropractic care to children, so many would be left needlessly suffering and many others would be left without the extra body awareness and respect that visiting a chiropractor teaches.Chiropractic care is safe, affordable, and low intervention care that benefits many children, its important that this goes on being available to families. When we talk about manipulation of a baby's spine we are talking about extremely refined, very specific, very gentle manoeuvres. These skilful adjustments are so non -invasive that their potential for injury is almost non -existent. We respect the seriousness of safety and this always comes first in the treatment of any patient; that is why chiropractic adjusting of the infant spine is done with such care and attention rendering it so effective and so safe. To take away peoples right to chose their own health care provider or that of their children, with no evidence of harm or dangerous practices is unjust and wrong. Chiropractic care has an exemplary safety record and achieves fantastic outcomes without the risks of more invasive treatments or side effects from medications. These practices have their place of course, but chiropractic should always be considered as a safe and effective option.Chiropractic care is effective / beneficial / no adverse outcomes in treating children Anyone who has birthed a baby or had first hand experience witnessing a birth knows the pressure on both mother and baby. The sooner misalignments are gently corrected the less detrimental impact on the brain, nerve system and skeletal structure. It would have been impossible to remould my daughter's skull if she had been left to age 12 when bones are solid. Her vital development and learning years would have been very challenging. People in our community really support what we do in our office and many people including people under 12 have received huge benefits from the work that we do. As a chiropractor I always ensure the force of an adjustment is appropriate for the age and condition of the patient and this is very gentle yet effective. It would be devastating to see people have their right to choose their healthcare practitioner taken away from them. If more children receive chiropractic care and have the healing capacity of my body imagine how healthy our population could be in the future. It would also significantly decrease the financial burden on our government through pharmaceutical and surgical costs.Stream 4: Practitioner who has not provided spinal care in the past three years.

Nil. There are no benefits. It is a dangerous practice by practitioners who refuse to use evidence based practice. The parents of the children I assessed were given incorrect information regarding the benefits of chiropractic care that was not supported by basic science let alone medical literature.Improved sleep and settling. Specifically, many children have presented with significant positive changes in their level of calmness, their ability to settle at night for improved sleep routines, and improvements in gross motor coordination as their sensory perception of body in space has been improved with greater spinal alignment. Parents report children are happier and sleep better.Improvement in breastfeeding Babies that are doing damage while sucking can often benefit from gentle physical work if adjustment of feeding position does not succeed in limiting the nipple damage. Babies with breastfeeding difficulties improving. The benefits I have observed are an amazing improvement in ; breast feeding, particularly babies that have only been able to breast feed comfortably from one breast (or when lying only on one side), feeding and sleeping patterns, and the change in a babies gape when attaching to the breast, that improves after a tongue tie release with ongoing chiropractic care.

I refer only to practitioners who are experienced in working in this area. None that I am specifically aware of, or have observed, in relation to chiropractic care.Observed: delayed diagnosis and treatment of scoliosis. Chiropractor clinics actively showing videos in waiting room dissuading mothers from having regular antenatal screening ultrasounds, I had to talk a pregnant lady back into having her morphology ultrasound after this false information was given to her. Fortunately, I am yet to personally have to manage direct physical adverse effects of this treatment. What I have experienced, however, is the infants involved, have generally had unnecessary and unhelpful treatment which has delayed their parents seeking appropriate treatment. Furthermore, this treatment generally feeds the anxiety of their parents.Unnecessary financial / economic cost It is a significant financial burden on parents who believe that the chiropractor is preventing illness or keeping their child healthy when there is 1) no evidence that chiropractic does this, 2) plenty of good -quality evidence that chiropractic achieves nothing for the vast majority of patients and certainly nothing for children, and 3) no sound scientific or anatomical basis for the theories underpinning chiropractic. I am also able to cite multiple examples of healthy infants whose parents have been advised to subject them to ongoing spinal treatments for 'birth trauma' (even in the absence of birth complications), 'flat heads' (which self resolve in the vast majority of cases once children are mobile), and for 'preventative care'. These treatments come at a significant out of pocket cost to families. A number of families are also receiving fearmongering advice regarding other issues, such as anti -vaccination information, tongue ties and false and sometimes dangerous nutritional information, from their spinal practitioners locally. They are also sold expensive and unnecessary supplements. Page 76\u00a9 2019 Ernst & Young. All Rights Reserved.

They are dangerous in their management, and vulnerable desperate parents who want the best for their children are being mislead. I believe allowing chiropractors to masquerade as health practitioners under the same regulatory body as myself and my colleagues is misleading to the community. I am concerned that a vulnerable patient group needs to be protected from the predatory behaviour of unscrupulous practitioners. Because people spend money and time on these treatments which can cause psychological harm and which can delay access to standard medical care. I also feel that it is morally unconscionable to be purporting to provide \"treatment\" that is costly and ineffective to vulnerable, worried parents who can be easily taken advantage of.Chiropractic care is safe and / is important to children's health I have seen amazing things happen for infants and parents after chiropractic care. As a midwife, I choose to use these services for my own health and that of my children. My daughter received chiropractic care from 6 days old. Chiro's, osteo's and physiotherapists all offer options for parents and babies, these options are difficult to do randomised control research on but the families that I see benefit from these therapies. They are gentle, far more gentle than a ventouse/forceps delivery. Where medicine is able to provide limited results for issues such as infant colic, families at present, have access to Chiropractic and Osteopathic care to turn to.Page 78\u00a9 2019 Ernst & Young.

Please help educate the community so they seek treatment for ethical, evidenced based, practitioners. It is very important to recognise that although some families may report symptomatic relief that often this can be easily explained by placebo effect. Although placebo effect in certain circumstances can be important and even helpful -this is more relevant with things like massage, where the therapy is harmless. If a positive placebo effect also carries a risk of death or disability -the risk outweighs the benefit.I would like to see the government invest more money into researching the manual therapies as they do give parents more options to deal with very unsettled babies instead of medicating. I totally deplore the action of a small group of bigoted biased obsessive people who are mostly not qualified in any health modality. I have witnessed huge changes in babies post spinal care. In particular better feeding, better sleeping, better post op results after tongue tie release.Chiropractic care is a necessary part of our health care system / shouldn't be banned or restricted The whole idea is ludicrous and to even consider limiting care to young people is so beyond belief that I can't believe I have to take part in the survey. As a medical doctor I want my patients to access to all aspects of health care and I trust that a good chiropractor is absolutely part of that equation. Chiropractic care and physiotherapy are both equal in value, and essential professions and all families need to be able to access these services for the best outcomes for their children. A scientific approach including consultation with university researchers and lecturers is also required before advocating for a change in health policy and provision of clinical guideline; this cannot be a socially motivated decision as any decision will not only effect the public, it will greatly impact many health professionals who service families and young children alongside other patients.Stream 5: Practitioner who has not provided spinal care for a child under 12 in the past three yearsDETAILED FINDINGSPage 81\u00a9 2019 Ernst & Young.

All Rights Reserved.

Chiropractors are well placed to offer safe, effective, evidence -based treatment to people of all ages. Chiropractic care is safe for children under 12 / safe for all Children have health issues just as adults do that may be identified and treated by a Chiropractor. As Chiropractors are primary care health professionals we are trained to identify what is a Chiropractic issue and what needs to be referred to another appropriate profession. As a profession we see many children with great results and very few adverse events as per Parnell Prevost et. al. (2019) study and others show. Compared to other common interventions, such as OTC paracetamol or ibuprofen, the risk/benefit profile of chiropractic in kids is far better according to the scientific evidence. Just as there are important dosing considerations of medicine use, so too are manual therapies modified for children to ensure their safety.I believe I have had no side effects from care due to the fact that children and babies require such light and gentle intervention. Not only are child/baby adjustments proportionally gentle due to their size, but minimal intervention is required as a result of their bodies being more receptive and less encumbered by years of adaptive change, (adhesions, scar tissue, neurological patterns etc). I believe that children under the age of 12 should be able to receive spinal care from Chiropractors. I have seen great improvements in not only pain, but quality of life in younger children over many years of observations while studying. I am yet to treat any children under 12 myself, but believe there is a place for chiropractic treatment in those younger than 12. Chiropractic spinal care for children under 12 is just as important for those over 12 years of age. Everyone deserves the right to treatment, and should not be determined on age. Whether it is a muscular issue like a hamstring string, or a joint dysfunction children under the age of 12 can benefit greatly from chiropractic spinal care.Chiropractic care is unscientific or not evidence based It is exploitation of parents' anxiety and fears. The practice does not follow any principles of basic science. Based on an absence of good quality research demonstrating any benefit, it should be prohibited. I feel it is completely unethical. There is no data showing this is effective or safe in this population. I have heard people claiming that spinal manipulation will cure asthma/reflux/allergies/poor sleep in babies and that they need re -alignment after \"birth trauma\". But I haven't seen any science that connects the spine and asthma or reflux for example.Page 86\u00a9 2019 Ernst & Young. All Rights Reserved.

All Rights Reserved.

I feel chiropractic care has a place in a developing child's life to ensure their body can be supported in its development into adulthood.Chiropractic care can be dangerous / not evidence based Chiropractic care is a safe, gentle alternative to costly medications and surgery. I believe that every parent and child should have a choice in their chosen healthcare modality/practitioner. There are many ethical, science -based Chiropractors within Australia who do great work with many children who benefit from their care. Restricting access to such practitioners will be detrimental to the health and well -being of these children.It involves the health of members of the general public who are largely unaware of the risks or lack of efficacy of this procedure. Because this treatment is dangerous and could permanently damage a child. It is also a waste of the parents' time and money which could have been better spent actually treating whatever the original concern was with evidence based treatment and without causing a delay in seeking appropriate treatment. Children with medical problems unrelated to the spine may be treated by chiropractors which has no basis in evidence. This may potentially result in harm mainly through delaying proper medical diagnosis and management.Parents should have the right to decide on their child / family's health Because if these laws are changed, it impedes on many of my colleagues' formal learning and will prevent parents having a legitimate choice in sourcing their health care. I choose to only treat a small, specific demographic who are all older than 12 so there is no personal benefit/deficit to me personally. The review threatens to remove the choice from the many hundreds of thousands of people who seek manual therapy for their children and the possible flow on health effects and the financial cost implications in the future should this happen. The bias and unfounded negative commentary about Chiropractic from supposedly educated people that are expected to have a considered view is unprofessional at best. I don't manually manipulate babies or children under 5 personally. Children between 5 and 12 make up a small portion of patronage and I choose management on a case by case basis and do find it useful as mentioned above. The key issue here is the restriction itself. The limiting of the choice of where parents can take children in regards to their health care. It is a loss of sovereignty and starts us down a slippery -slope of further limitation.Stream 6: Practitioner who chose not to provide their AHPRA numberDETAILED FINDINGSPage 89\u00a9 2019 Ernst & Young.

All Rights Reserved. Liability limited by a scheme approved under Professional Standards Legislation 30553. -Safer Care Victoria -Review of Chiropractic Care -Final Report -13AUG2019Sample Verbatim Comments: Chiropractic care is medically beneficial for children under 12 As babies this care was life changing. I had a baby who was incredibly distressed and clingy and cried and screamed constantly. It was very tough on my mental health. Multiple trips to the hospital and GP found no answers. We began seeing the chiropractor then and have never looked back. It saved my sanity and had such a profound effect on the distressed state my then - baby girl was in. I'll never forget it.Consumer choice around health should not be restricted Chiropractic care has been proven to benefit the health of children of all ages by providing a drug -free approach to their symptoms. Research has since proven the benefits of chiropractic care and the safety of its treatments. I am a podiatrist who commonly sees children in my clinic that have immensely benefited from spinal manipulation from a chiropractor, in improving overall health and function. The parents are always extremely happy with the results and only have positive and gentle experiences to share. I feel passionately about allowing parents this choice in health care and would be devastated if this was to be made inaccessible to me when I have children.It is our right as human beings to have choice for how we want to look after our health. Chiropractors have a lot more knowledge for children's health that goes past the scope of just spinal manipulation. All children and parents should have the right to chose chiropractic care as part of a healthy spinal care plan. This is a parents right to access the care they believe is best for their children. Chiropractic care is safe for children under 12 The fact that with chiropractic [medicine's] exceptional safety record that this review is even occurring absolutely baffles me... especially when in comparison to other health care providers and the known risks that they are often associated. Chiropractic care for all ages, babies to geriatrics is imperative for the proper function and coordination of all living cells and tissues in the body. Optimal nervous system function is essential for all systems and function in the body -particularly babies, as they are constantly growing and dependent on a solid functional nervous system. Spinal care is never dangerous when properly applied and I am outraged by the false statements that Chiropractic is unsafe for humans of any age. Page 92\u00a9 2019 Ernst & Young.

I believe that everyone should have access to chiropractic treatments.Chiropractic care can be dangerous / not evidence -based To finish, spinal manipulation is safe and highly effective for the overall health of all ages, and to restrict its application for any age is a issue that touches on freedom of choice. If I was to refuse treatment or the mother was anxious about having a chiropractor treat or be examined by me . That child would have had a lower quality of life, sickness possibly be have growth hindering problems associated with their physical ailments. Please, please, please do the right thing and set an example to the rest of Australia by banning this form of unnecessary practice on children. This is a matter of child protection and safety, as well as a safe guard for vulnerable parents who spend large amounts of money on non - evidence based \"therapy\" without the knowledge of the potential harm that can be caused with only a placebo effect as benefit. Chiropractors spread false information to people about the benefits of their treatment - this becomes dangerous when they are spreading this information to parents, who give consent for the chiropractor to treat their child's spine. Parents should have the right to decide on their child / family's health It is important because it is about our right to choose which type of health care we want for our family. The research will conclude that it is not a question of public safety. The public are not at a health risk with chiropractic care. If the effectiveness of chiropractic care for treatment for children under 12 is under investigation, a similar investigation should be undergone for the safety and efficacy of health care practitioners across all disciplines. This review is important to me because I believe this is about choice for people and their children. If you take that away this becomes a police state where people are not allowed to make their own health choices. Having had chiropractic my whole life since I was born I believe everybody deserves that opportunity. I think it is important that parents have the right to choose the health care they want for their children. I have had many desperate parents come to seek care when nothing else has helped their distressed child with mostly very good outcomes. Some children have not responded as well as others but I have never seen an adverse effect of care for children.AppendixPage 95\u00a9 2019 Ernst & Young. All Rights Reserved.

Better Evidence. Systematic Review of Spinal Manipulation in Children Review prepared by Cochrane Australia for Safer Care Victoria 19 August 2019 Review team Sally Green, Steve McDonald, Melissa Murano, Miyoung Choi and Sue Brennan Systematic Review of Spinal Manipulation in Children Page 2 of 67 Executive Summary Safer Care Victoria commissioned Cochrane Australia to undertake this systematic review of the effectiveness and safety of spinal manipulation in children under 12 years for any condition or symptom. S pinal manipulation is defined as any technique delivered by any health professional that involves a high velocity, low amplitude thrust beyond the physiological range of motion, impacting the spine, within the limits of anatomical integrity . Additional consideration was given to the safet y and effectiveness of coccygeal manipulation in children. Existing, high -quality systematic reviews have assessed the evidence for spinal manipulation in children . For timeliness, and t o avoid unnecessary duplication, we identif ied the subset of evidence on the effectiveness and safety of spinal manipulation in children from these existing reviews, and include d relevant studies published before or aft er their completed search dates. We included 13 studies (11 randomised trials) of the effectiveness of SMT across several conditions: colic (three studies), enuresis , back/neck headache , , cerebral palsy hyperactivity (two studies) and torticollis. Based on meta -analysis of three studies, w e found low certainty e vidence that , in infants with colic, mean crying time may be reduced among infants who received spinal manipulation compared to a control (sham, no treatment, active comparator) (0.71 hours (43 minutes) per day lower, 95% CI 1.87 (112 minutes) lower to 0.4 6 (28 minutes) higher; 3 trials, 156 infants). However, the confidence interval is wide and includes a possible increase in crying time. We found low certainty evidence that the mean number of wet nights may be reduced among children with enuresis who received SMT compared to sham SMT (1.6 fewer wet nights per fortnight, 95% CI 3.2 fewer to 0 more; 1 trial, 57 participants). However, the confidence interval is wide and includes the possibility of no effect . For other conditions there was either no evidence of effect, or no data available from which to draw a conclusion. For safety , we identified ten studies. Six of these studies aimed to determine the rates of adverse events occurring across populations of infants and children u ndergoing SMT. These studies reported rates spanning one minor treatment aggravation per 1812 consultations to one cerebrovas cular incident in 20,000 visits. Two related studies investigated physiological responses to spinal manipulation in children and re ported a pnoea and skin flushing in 50 of 199 treated infants; and in a separate study, severe but short -lasting bradycardia in almost 50% of infants less than three months old, and in 87 of 695 children over four months. Four studies described five individual cases of adverse effects from SMT in infants or children . Of these, three were classified as severe and two as moderate. Of the three reports of a serious adverse event, one resulted in death. The technique employed in this case was described as the V ojta technique and involved forced active rotation and head retraction (case report from Germany in 2001). Other serious adverse events were loss of consciousness with recovery and hospitalisation for drowsiness and weakness . Separate to the review of spinal manipulation, we aimed to review studies on the safety and effectiveness of coccygeal manipulation in children . Despite a comprehensive search we were unable to identify any relevant studies. Consistent with the findings o f other systematic reviews, due to the paucity of studies and the lack of reported information on the specific treatment techniques employed, it is difficult to draw conclusions about the safety and effectiveness of spinal manipulation in children. Systematic Review of Spinal Manipulation in Children Page 3 of 67 1. Bac kground 1.1 Why we are undertaking this review Safer Care Victoria (SCV) commissioned this external systematic review in response to concerns raised about the practice of performing spinal manipulation on infants. The findings of this review will inform the deliberations of an expert panel, convened by SCV, ultimately resulting in recommendations from SCV to the Council Of Australian Governments (COAG). The systematic review team was requested to identify, consider and synthesise evidence relating to both the effectiveness and safety of spinal manipulation in children less than 12 years of age. Additional consideration was to be given to the safety and effectiveness of coccygeal manipulation. 1.2 Description of the intervention Spinal manipulation is a ma nual therapy technique performed by chiropractors and other manipulative therapists, including osteopaths, physiotherapists and medical practitioners. For the purpos es of this review, the expert panel has defined the technique as being characterised by high velocity, low amplitude (HVLA) thrust, beyond the physiological range of motion, impacting the spine, within the limits of anatomical integrity. 1.3 Existing systematic review evidence Existing, high -quality systematic reviews have assessed the evidence for spinal manipulation in children. A comprehensive systematic review published in Marc h 2019 by Parnell Prevost et al. evaluated the use of manual therapy for clinical conditions in the paediatric population delivered by any health profession (1) . The review includes an assessment of the methodological quality of the included studies, summarises findings according to health condition, and reports any adverse events within the included studies. The 50 studies included in the review covered several types of manual therapy, including 15 studies of spinal manipulative therapy (SMT) in children, and evaluated spinal manipulation in a wide variety of paediatric conditions (grouped by gastrointestinal, musculoskeletal, respiratory, special needs and struc tural). An even more recent systematic review published in June 2019 by Driehuis at al. evaluated SMT in infants, children and adolescents (2). In this review, interventions indicated as SMT were defined as \"manual therapeutic interventions in which treatment techniques were primarily performed on the full spine or on specific spinal segments, by any healthcare professional\". Distinction was mad e between two main SMT techniques: manipulation (HVLA or low -velocit y thrust) and mobilization (low velocity, low amplitude without thrust). A systematic review from 2018 by Carnes et al. focused on manual therapy (including spinal manipulation) for unsett led, distressed and excessively crying infants 0 -12 months of age (3). Finally, a s afety review from 2015 by Todd e t al. explored the safety and adverse effects asso ciated with manual therapy in children under 18 years of age (4). Collectively, these reviews provide a comprehensive evidence base, some extending beyond spinal manipulation to include other manual techniques and other structures. To avoid unnecessary duplication and to complete the commissioned revi ew in a timely manner, we aimed to identify t he full subset of evidence on the effectiveness and safety of spinal manipulation in children from these existing reviews, and to include any relevant studies published after their completed search dates. Systematic Review of Spinal Manipulation in Children Page 4 of 67 2. Objectives To assess the effectiveness and safety of spinal manipulation, defined as any technique delivered by any health professional that involves a high velocity, low amplitude thrust beyond the physiological range of motion, impacting the spine, within the limits of anatomical integrity, conducted in children under 12 years for any condition or symptoms. 3. Methods Our overall approach was to use the reviews by Parnell Prevost 2019, Carnes 2018 and Todd 2015 as the principal source of primary studies for this review and to supplement the evidence included in these reviews by searching for eligible studies published s ince those reviews were conducted. The most recent review by Driehuis was published in June 2019, after the completion of our searches, but we have been able to include a full assessment of this review and its included studies to ensure there are no additi onal relevant studies . Appendix 1 summarises the main characteristics of the most relevant existing systematic reviews on this topic. 3.1 Assessment of the existing systematic reviews Given the four existing systematic reviews were the main source of primary studies, we assessed the search methods of each review to make sure the searches were comprehensive, both in terms of the range of sources searched and the specific search terms used. In the case of the review by Driehuis, the review that most closely matched our inclusion criteria, we also conducted a risk of bias assessment using the Risk of Bias in Sys tematic Reviews (ROBIS) tool (5). The ROBIS tool assesses three aspects of systematic reviews: (i) relevance; (ii) how the review was conducted; and (iii) an overall judgement of risk of bias in interpretation of the review's findings. 3.2 Criteria for considering studies for this review 3.2.1 Types of participants Children under 12 years of age, including babies and infants, treated with spinal manipulation from any healthcare professional for any condition or indication. If studies included adolescents or adults, in addition to children, and we are unable to extract data separately for children, we included these studies provided the majority of participants were under 12 years or the mean age of participants was less than 12. Where applicable, our interpretation of the findin gs of these studies takes account of the inclusion of this more indirect evidence. 3.2.2 Types of interventions/exposures Several therapies include, or may include, manipulation of the spine. For studies in children under 12 years of age that were inclu ded in the Parnell Prevost review (and categorised as Spinal Manipulative Therapy (SMT), Chiropractic Manipulative Therapy, Osteopathic Manipulative Therapy and Cranial -Sacral Therapy) we sought confirmation from screening the full- text report of the study whether a form of spinal manipulation meeting our definition was used. Where relevant we used the explanation of techniques in Figure 1, reproduced from Alcantara 2009, to determine whether the described intervention was consistent with our definition of Systematic Review of Spinal Manipulation in Children Page 5 of 67 spinal manipulative therapy (6). When we were unable to interpret the definition of the intervention, we sought clarification from the panel. Figure 1 . Description of techniques ( reproduced from Alcantara 2009) Those studies that sought to evaluate spinal manipulation, and for which the majority of participants received SMT , were eligible. We applied these same criteria both for identification of the relevant subset of studies within the existing reviews, and when screening records as part of the search update. Studies in which SMT is a co -intervention (e.g. with exercise) were to be included provided the comparator group allowed any differences in effect to be attribut ed to SMT (e.g. SMT + exercise versus exercis e alone). In the case of safety studies, we planned to include co - interventions and decide on the likelihood that the adverse event was attributable to SMT , however we did not identify any studies that clearly described SMT and a co -intervention. 3.2.3 Types of outcome measures For the effectiveness review, any new eligible studies were grouped according to the broad condition categories and associated outcomes used in Parnell Prevost: Gastrointestinal (e.g. colic, nocturnal enuresis, breastfeeding) Musculoskeletal headache, low back pain) Respiratory (e.g. asthma, otitis media) Special needs (e.g. ADHD, autism, cerebral palsy) Structural (e.g. scoliosis, torticollis) We selected the primary outcome measure(s) or, if these were not specified, the outcomes that most directly addressed the objectives of the study. For the safety review , we adopted the categories used by Todd to define the seriousness of the adverse ev ent: Mild (transient effects lasting less than 24 hours, e.g. crying or discomfort) or Moderate (requiring medical/general practitioner treatment) Severe (requiring hospital treatment, including disability or death) 3.2.4 Types of studies For the effectiveness review , eligible studies included both randomised trials and observational studies, provided the observational studies included a comparator (e.g. non - randomised trial, cohort study, controlled before -and -after study). Exclusions included n on- comparative studies (e.g. case reports or case series without pre and post measurements or a control group) and cross -sectional studies. Systematic Review of Spinal Manipulation in Children Page 6 of 67 Other exclusions: studies that were only available as abstracts; feasibility studies without outcome measures; full -text report not available in English. For the safety review any article reporting adverse events was eligible, irrespective of the study type (i.e. trials, observational studies, case reports, etc.). Articles not reporting case information (e.g. commenta ries or editorials) were excluded, as were full -text reports not available in English (unless these had been included and fully described in Todd). 3.3 Search methods for identification of studies 3.3.1 Overall approach For both the effectiveness and s afety reviews , we ran searches covering the period from the last search date in the Parnell Prevost and Todd reviews (searching forward from April 2018 and January 2014, respectively). The decision to rely on these two systematic reviews as the primary source of eligibl e studies was based on an assessment of their search methods, which in both cases we considered to be extensive. For the effectiveness review , we also searched from 1960 to 1999 since Parnell Prevost only included studies published since 2000. We revised t he search strategies, taking account of differences in scope, and ensured an appropriate range of databases and sources were searched. The shorter time period to search across meant that we could apply broader search criteria for spinal manipulation and adverse events. The review considered peer reviewed literature, as well as unpublished and grey literature. Only studies reported in English were included (but relevant studies in other languages were noted , and included if they were fully reported in Todd). We also retrieved any additional relevant systematic reviews we came across as a means of identifying any additional eligible primary studies. The searches across all sources were run on 13 May 2019. We set up a weekly auto alert to capture publications added to PubMed from 13 May to 15 June 2019 . 3.3.2 Search terms The PubMed search strategy combined Medical Subject Headings (MeSH) and equivalent free- text terms and synonyms (see below). The exploded MeSH term Musculoskeletal Manipulations includes Chir opractic, Osteopathic and Orthopedic Manipulations as narrower terms. For the safety review, the MeSH subheadings adverse effects and complications are included as floating subheadings, such that any record indexed with these subheadings (regardless of the condition or intervention) were retrieved. In developing these search strategies we consulted the Parnell Prevost and Todd reviews, and checked the InterTASC website for search filters for retrievin g studies of adverse effects (7) . Effectiveness review Intervention terms Population terms Musculoskeletal Manipulations[Mesh] Infant [Mesh] OR Adolescent[Mesh] OR child OR children OR infant OR infants OR newborn* OR neonate* OR baby OR babies OR paediatric OR pediatric OR young[TIAB] OR adolescent* Limited to records added to PubMed since April 2018 Systematic Review of Spinal Manipulation in Children Page 7 of 67 We evaluated the performance of th e search by checking retrieval against the set of 50 studies included in the Parnell Prevost review. Our search retrieved all 46 studies that are included in PubMed. The remaining four studies are included in Index to Chiropractic Literature (ICL) , and our ICL search strategy also identified these four studies. The above PubMed strategy, when applied to the period from 1960 to 1999 , retrieved over 3500 records. To make the screening task more manageable, we increased the precision of the search by r emoving terms that were least relevant (cervical, chiropractic, osteopathic and craniosacral). Intervention terms Population terms Manipulation, Chiropractic[Mesh] OR Manipulation, Spinal[Mesh] \"spinal babies[TIAB] OR paediatric[TIAB] OR pediatric[TIAB] Limited to records in PubMed with publication year 1960 to 1999 Safety review The intervention and population terms were the same as for the effectiveness review search (2018- 19). The safety terms were deliberately broad to minimise the chance of missing relevant studies. Intervention terms Population terms Safety terms As for Effectiveness review (2018 -19) As for Effectiveness review (2018 -19) adverse OR unwanted OR \"side effect*\" OR reaction* OR complication* OR harm* OR injury OR injuries OR risk OR risks OR safe* OR adverse effects[sh] OR complications[sh] Limited to records added to PubMed since January 2014 3.3.3 Bibliographic databases In addition to PubMed, we searched the following bibliographic databases: Index to Chiropractic Literature, Embase, Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials, CINAHL, Allied and Complementary Medicine (AMED) and Scopus. See Appendix 2 for the search strategies. We chose not to search clinical trial registers separately since the Cochrane trials register includes all records of randomised trials from ClinicalTrials.gov and the WHO ICTRP international trials register. 3.3.4 Other sources The reference lists of eligible studies and relevant systematic reviews were checked for additional studies. We considered using Google Scholar for a general internet search, as indicated in the protocol, but opted against this given the time constraints and the additional safeguards resulting from the ability to cross -check our included studies against very recent published systematic reviews. Systematic Review of Spinal Manipulation in Children Page 8 of 67 3.4 Data collection and analysis 3.4.1 Selection of studies Records identified from the database searches were imported to EndNote and duplicates removed. Records were then imported to Covidence for screening. For the effectiveness review, two reviewers (MM and SM) independently screened records (titles and abstracts) to either include (Yes or Maybe) or exclude (No) for full -text review based on the inclusion criteria. Disagreements about eligibility were resolved through referral to a third reviewer (SG). The full -text of all potentially eligible studies were retrieved and independently screened by two reviewers (MM and SM). Studies were excluded based on participant age and intervention, fol lowed by study design. The final decision on the inclusion of studies was agreed among all reviewers. For the safety review, one reviewer (SG) screened all records (titles and abstracts) and assessed the full -text of potentially eligible studies. The ratio nale for single screening was the level of content expertise required to efficiently interpret studies (i.e. eligible manipulative techniques) when there are no exclusions around study type. Systematic reviews Reviews that overlapped with the scope of this review were identified during the screening phase and the list of included studies (effectiveness and safety) were extracted and cross - checked against Parnell Prevost and Todd. Any primary studies not included in Parnell Prevost or Todd were then retrieve d and checked for eligibility for inclusion in this review. 3.4.2 Data extraction and management For the effectiveness review, for relevant studies included in Parnell Prevost , one reviewer (MM) extract ed study characteristics and data as reported in the review (see below) and used the same template for any new included studies. A second reviewer checked data extraction for accuracy and completeness. Disagreements w ere resolved by discussion within the review team. The following characteristics were extracted : condition category author and year published setting/country* profession of practitioner* study objective study design sample size patient description (age) and condition description of intervention and comparator * outcomes measured* results for main outcome adverse events * information on these characteristics was not included in the tables provided in Parnell Prevost and was therefore extracted from the full -text of all relevant studies. For the safety review, we adopt ed the template used in the Todd review for all new studies identified. Within each broad category of adverse event (serious, mild to moderate) the following study characteristics were collected: Systematic Review of Spinal Manipulation in Children Page 9 of 67 author and year published study design/details key findings number of adverse events description of the adverse event patient characteristics practitioner type intervention/technique setting/country underlying pathology/condition When given in reports, we extracted information on recovery time and time to onset of adverse event; this information was also used to categorise the severity of the adverse event. 3.4.3 Assessment of risk of bias of included studies We had intended to use the risk of bias assessments in cluded i n Parnell Prevost , since the randomised trials were rated using the Cochrane risk of bias tool (with low, unclear or high risk of bias reported for each risk of bias domain) and observational studies using a modified version of the AHRQ tool (8). Parnell Prevost then gave a n overall quality rating of low, moderate or high f or each study. When we check ed a sample of these risk of bias assessments our rating of bias did not always agree , and we were concerned that study limitations were not appropriately addressed in the overall quality rating for each study. As result, we re -did the bias assessments and applied Cochrane's approach in reaching an overall risk of bias assessment (low, some concerns, high). For new studies identified, one reviewer (MM or MC) conduct ed risk of bias ass essments using the Cochrane risk of bias tool for randomised trials. A second reviewer (SM or SB) check ed the assessment for accuracy and completeness. For the safety review, the type of study or article reporting the adverse event was noted, but no assessment of study quality was included since the p urpose of the review was to collate all reports of adverse events, regardless of source. However , notes regarding the source studies and any methodological considerations in interpreting the reports were included in the data extraction table. 3.4.4 Data s ynthesis and overall certainty of the evidence Effectiveness review For the eligible studies included in the reviews by Parnell Prevost and Carnes, we extract ed the results data for the primary outcome from the original report of the study and present ed available estimates of effect (95% confidence intervals, p -values) in the characteristics of included studies table, grouped by condition. We conducted meta -analysis w here this was feasible and appropriate . The overall certainty of the evidence was assess ed for each condition/ outcome using GRADE criteria where feasible (risk of bias, consistency, imprecision, indirectness and publication bias) and the evidence rated as high, moderate, low or very low. Both the Parnell Prevost and Carnes reviews rate the st rength of evidence for each outcome using criteria that can be mapped to GRADE. Summary of findings tables were prepared using the GRADEpro GDT software. For each condition and outcome, the summary of findings table included estimates of treatment effects reported as absolute and relative risks, and the overall GRADE (rating of quality). Additional Systematic Review of Spinal Manipulation in Children Page 10 of 67 information included the study design(s), number of studies and number of participants contributing data (the type and size of the evidence base); and a plain la nguage statement interpreting the evidence (clinical impact) for each comparison and outcome. Footnotes were used to explain judgements. Safety review For the eligible studies included in Todd and for new studies identified, we tabulate d the findings by study , structured by severity of adverse event . For serious adverse events, we ensured any event listed in multiple studies was included only once, using the primary report as the included study . We did not GRADE results for adverse effect s, since GRADE is unlikely to be informative for decisions in this case. In general, findings about adverse effects are likely to come from studies with limitations leading to a GRADE of low or very low certainty evidence. 4. Results 4.1 Effectiveness review 4.1.1 Selection of studies We included 13 studies in total; six were derived from Parnell Prevost 2019 and seven from new searches (outside the period of the Parnell Prevost search). No additional included studies were derived from Driehuis 2019. 4.1.1.1 Parnell Prevost 2019 The full -text of all 50 studies included in Parnell Prevost were checked for eligibility. Since the inclusion criteria for Parnell Prevost were broader than this review (effectiveness of any manual therapy in children under 18 y ears of age), we excluded studies initially on the basis of age of participants, followed by an assessment of intervention technique and then study design. Figure 2 shows which studies were excluded at each stage and which studies met the eligibility criteria. A full explanation for excluding the 44 studies from Parnell Prevost is given in Appendix 3. Systematic Review of Spinal Manipulation in Children Page 11 of 67 Figure 2. Flow chart of studies in Parnell Prevost 2019 4.1.1.2 Driehuis 2019 This review included 12 studies evaluating the effectiveness of spinal manual therapy, of which nine are included in our review. Two of the studies we excluded were in adolescents and one study we deemed not meet the inclusion criteria for the intervention (Miller 2012; listed in Excluded studies table , Appendix 3 ). Since the Driehuis review most closely aligns with the question our review addresses, and includes GRADE assessments of the evidence, we conducted a risk of bias assessment using the ROBIS tool. As summarised in Table 1 below, we rated the review to be of sound methodological quality and to have an overall rating of low risk of bias. The full ROBIS assessment is in Appendix 4. Systematic Review of Spinal Manipulation in Children Page 12 of 67 Table 1. ROBIS assessment for Driehuis 2019 Overall, the review is judged to be of sound methodological quality. Did the interpretation of findings address all of the concerns identified in Domains 1 to 4? The review conclusions are appropriately cautiou s, and the evidence uncertain. For this reason is it is unlikely that a ny of the identified concerns are likely to change the conclusions of the review. Yes Was the relevance of identified studies to the review's research question appropriately considered? Study characteristics were carefully considered in the review and conclusions (including in GRADEing the evidence). The authors note that there is insufficient description of interventions in primary studies, which poses a challenge for interpretation of findings. Yes Did the review authors avoid emphasising results on the basis of their statistical significance? The authors appear to have avoided emphasising results based on statistical significance (i.e. highlighting results that were statistically significant over those that were not). Although not a bias, most results are reported as summary statistics for each treatment group. This makes the results more challenging to interpret and GRADE than if effect estimates and the precision of each estimate had been calcu lated (e.g. the difference in pain scores between the intervention and control groups). Yes Overall risk of bias LOW 4.1.1.3 Search for additional primary studies We searched PubMed, Index to Chiropractic Literature, Embase, Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials, CINAHL, Allied and Complementary Medicine (AMED) and Scopus on 13 May 2019 ( see Appendix 2 ). Further weekly searches of PubMed continued until 15 June 2019. After removing duplicates, 1285 records were screened in Covidence (an onlin e screening tool for systematic reviews). The full -text of 42 potentially eligible studies and relevant reviews were checked. Seven studies met the eligibility criteria and are included in the review; the majority of those excluded were either systematic r eviews or deemed not to evaluate spinal manipulation as the intervention (see Figure 3 ). (The five studies we excluded on the basis of intervention are detailed at the end of Appendix 3 .) We identified a pro tocol for a randomised trial of chiropractic treatment for infantile colic published in 2018 by Holm (9). No results have been reported but it is unlikely the specific treatment would meet our inclusion criteria . Systematic Review of Spinal Manipulation in Children Page 13 of 67 Figure 3 . PRISMA flowchart (effectiveness) 4.1.1.4 Other systematic reviews In addition to Parnell Prevost and Driehuis, we identified 11 potentially relevant reviews published in 2018 or 2019. For each review we cross -checked the included studies against Parnell Prevost and Todd (see Table 2) but identified no additional primary studies meeting our eligibility criteria.

This is a narrative review that uses the social research method of document analysis to report medical practices regarding \"the management of infantile colic by manual means including manipulation.\" Studies and other information for inclusion were identified from searches of Medline and the Index to Chiropractic Literature, supplemented by hand -searching the private collections of the authors and textbooks by authors known to have also published in the peer -reviewed literature. Inclusion criteria were peer -reviewed sources that were cat egorised as 'manipulation by medical practitioners'. Forty -five papers were analysed for words and phrases reporting the management of infantile colic. The authors used document analysis to extract relevant sentences and paragraphs from the included report s. Many reports and documents are included which do not meet the selection criteria for study type in this systematic review. Five of the 45 included reports are identified as randomised trials and one a prospective cohort. The majority of the other includ es are from narrative sources, titles and case reports (see Table 3 below). Systematic Review of Spinal Manipulation in Children Page 15 of 67 The five studies categorised as trials and one cohort study were cross -checked against our existing list of known studies of s pinal manipulation in children (see footnotes Table 3 below).

The conditions covered included colic (three studie s), enuresis , back/neck pain, headache , hyperactivity (two studies ) and torticollis . Detailed characteristics of each included study are presented in Table 4 below. Eleven of the 13 studies were individual randomised trials, one was a randomised feasibility study and one a non -randomised pre -post intervention study. The median sample size was 50 (range 7 to 243). The p ractitioners delivering treatments wer e mostly chiropractors (nine studies); other practitioners were 'manual therapists', physiotherapist s, osteopaths and orthopaedic doctors. Studies were conducted in several countries and settings: USA (four studies), Denmark (2), Norway (2 ), and one study in each of Germany, UK, Italy, Canada and Ukraine . Full des criptions of the interventions/ techniques used in the included studies are detailed in Appendix 5. There was wide variation in the number of visits and the number of manipulations included, often with incomplete reporting, but all intervention descriptions included terms associated with high velocity, low amplitude thrust. One study described SMT to the cervical spine only, two studies to the full spine (lumbar and cervical both mentioned), and in 10 studies the area of SMT was either not described or at the practitioners' discretion.

RCT n = 34 Children ages 6 - 17 with persistent asthma Chiropractic spinal manipulative therapy carried out with a HVLA thrust vs sham control Pulmonary function tests, peak expiratory f low (PEF) and inhaler use, questionnaire assessing quality of life, asthma severity and improvement The effects of SMT compared to sham SMT were not reported (results data are limited to feasibility of conducting an RCT; and PEF in the SMT group before and after treatment) Not mentioned Systematic Review of Spinal Manipulation in Children Page 18 of 67 Condition Study ID / Country Practitioner/ Setting Study objective Study design / Sample size Patient description (age) and condition Description of intervention and comparator Outcome(s) measured (main bolded) Result for main outcome (conclusion if result not reported) Adverse events Asthma Balon 1998 (33) Canada Chiropractor Private practices To determine efficacy of chiropractic manipulation as adjunct treatment for childhood asthma. RCT n = 91 Children ages 7 - 16 who had continuing symptoms of asthma despite usual medical therapy Chiropractic spinal manipulative therapy (HVLA directional push) vs sham control Lung function: morning peak expiratory flow (PEF) before use of bronchodilator (change from baseline 4 months from start of treatment). Other : spirometry, asthma symptoms Little or no difference in peak expiratory flow with SMT compared to sham (MD 0.7% lower peak flow with SMT; 95% CI 6.6% lower to 5% higher, very low certainty evidence). Authors reported there were no negative side effects. Otitis media Sawyer 1999 (34) USA Chiropractor Chiropractic college To assess the feasibility of conducting a full -scale RCT investigating the efficacy of chiropractic SMT for children with chronic otitis media with effusion. Randomized feasibility study n = 20 Infants and children aged 6 months to 6 years with chronic otitis media with effusion Chiropractic spinal manipulative therapy (HVLA) vs sham co ntrol Days with otitis media symptoms (change from baseline, 8 weeks from start of treatment; daily diary kept by parents). Other : middle ear status profile (otoscopic and tympanometric evaluations), sleep patterns, need for medical care, medications Mean number of days wi th otitis media symptoms was 2.1 days more with SMT compared to sham SMT, however the confidence interval includes a reduction and a large increa se in symptom days (95% CI 4.3 days fewer to 8.5 days more; low certainty evidence). Results f or middle ear status (the primary outcome) are not presented here because the trialists reported problems with data collection such that \" data could not be obtained or were unreliable .\" No serious side effects were reported. Three children had 'minimal self - limiting side effects' (one reported mid- back soreness that resolved, one irritability, one excessive crying after treatment). Cerebral palsy Kachmar 2018 (35) Ukraine Orthopaedic doctor Rehabilitation clinic To investigate short - term effects of spinal manipulation on wrist muscle spasticity and manual dexterity in children with cerebral palsy. RCT n = 79 Children ages 8 - 18 with spastic forms of cerebral palsy Spinal manipulation (thoracic, lumbar and cervical HVLA thrust) vs sham treatment Muscle spasticity in wrist (15 minutes post - treatment; measured with Neuroflexor). Other : manual dexterity An immediate reduction in muscle spasticity was found with SMT compared to sham manipulation (15 minutes post -treatment); however, the 95% confidence interval includes the possibility of no difference and effects at clinically important time points were no t measured (very low certainty evidence).

Six studies were considered to be at high risk of bias overall and five at low risk of bias overall . One study was assessed as having some concerns, and in one, which did not report outcome data, risk of bias was not assessed. There was variation in approach to allocation concealment, but all studies blinded their outcome assessor and reported all outcomes. Where we had concerns about bias, for example in relation to selection bias if randomisation was not adequately described, or performance bias if parents were not blinded, we took these into account when grading the evidence for each result (as presented in the summary of findings table (Table 6) ).

Infant colic Based on meta -anal ysis of three studies (see Figure 4 below), w e found low certainty evidence that mean crying time may be reduced among infants who received spinal manipulation compared to a control (sham, no treatment, active comparator) (0.71 hours (43 minutes) per day lower, 95% CI 1.87 hrs (112 min s) lower to 0.46 hrs (28 min s) higher; 3 trials, 156 infants). However, the confidence interval is wide and includes a possible increase in crying time. Figure 4: Crying time (h ours) (follow up: range 8 to 14 day s) Enuresis We found low certainty evidence that the mean number of wet nights may be reduced among children with enuresis who received SMT compared to sham SMT (1.6 fewer wet nights per fortnight, 95% CI 3.2 fewer to 0 more; 1 trial, 57 participants). Ho wever, the confidence interval is wide and includes the possibility of no effect. Back and/or neck pain We found low certainty evidence that the rate of recurrence of spinal pain may be higher among children who receive SMT compared to no SMT (26% higher, 95% CI: from 2% lower to 61% higher, 1 trial, 243 participants). However, the confidence interval is wide and includes a small, probably unimportant reduction in the rate of recurrence. Other conditions We found very low certainty evidence about the effect of spinal manipulation on headache (Borusiak 2010), asthma (Balon 1998), cerebral palsy (Kachmar 2018), hyperactivity (Accorsi 2014) and torticollis (Sawyer 1 999). The true effect of the spinal manipulation on these conditions is likely to be substa ntially different from the reported estimates of effect (see Table 3 for results). The two remaining trials, one on asthma (Bronfort 2001) and one on hyperactivity (Giesen 1989), did not report useable data (see Table 4 for details).

The trial on headache reported minor adverse events: hot skin (SMT 6 children, placebo sham 9), dizziness (SMT 7, placebo sham 4), transitory increase in headache intensity and frequency (SMT 8, placebo sham 6). The trial on otitis media reported 'minimal self - limiting' adverse events: mid- back pain (SMT 1), irritability (SMT 1), excessive crying (placebo 1). The remaining 9 trials did not report on adverse events (including the 3 trials on infant colic). 730 (13 RCTs) VERY LOW aa The evidence about adverse events from randomised trials is very uncertain. Nine of 13 trials included for the effectiveness review did not mention (and may not have measured) adverse events. The remaining four trials reported no or minor adverse events. *The risk in the intervention group (and its 95% confidence interval) is based on the assumed risk in the comparison group and the relative effect of the intervention (and its 95% CI).

Mean crying time with comparator was calculated from the mean crying time at final follow up in each of the three studies. b. Serious concerns ( -1) about risk of selection bias (unclear randomisation in one study, unclear allocation concealment in two studies), and attrition bias (incomplete data for all studies, with greater attrition from control arms in two studies (31/99; 31%) compared to inter vention arms (11/99; 10%)). c. Some inconsistency, but not downgraded because already downgraded for imprecision, which is influenced by inconsistent effects across studies. d. Serious concerns ( -1) about imprecision. 95% confidence interval includes reduction in crying time of just under 2 hours per day an d an increase of about half an hour per day. Number of participants is also less than optimal information size of approximately 400. e. Different comparators were used in (OSD); Olafsdottir 2001: no manipulation control wherein a nurse brought the baby to the chiropractor, then baby was undressed and held for 10 minutes (comparable to treatment); Wiberg 1999: dimethicone daily for 2 weeks [12- 15 days]). f. Mean nights of bed wetting for comparator at final follow up in the single study. g. Serious concerns ( -1) about risk of selection bias. No information about randomisation method or whether group allocation was concealed. h. Inconsistency could not be assessed (single study, not downgraded but results require replication in other studies). i. Serious concerns ( -1) about imprecision. The 95% confidence interval includes a potentially important reduction in bed wetting (3 nights per fortnight) and a trivial increase. The number of participants is also less than the optimal information size of approximately 400. j. Events per 1000 patient days (not per 1000 people) k. Number of patient days (not number of participants) l. Serious concerns ( -1) about indirectness. Participants' mean age was 12.6 years (eligibility 9 to 15 years) and results for children under 12 are not reported separately. m. Serious concerns ( -1) about imprecision. 95% confidence interval includes no difference in recurrence and a small, possibly important increase. Number of par ticipants is also less than optimal information size of approximately 400. n. Serious concerns ( -1) about risk of bias due to unexplained loss to follow in the intervention group (4/28 in the intervention group compared to 0/24 in the control group). o. Not downgraded for indirectness. Mean age was 11.6 years (SD 2.3). p. Very serious ( -2) concerns about imprecision. The 95% confidence interval includes both a potentially important decrease and a potentially important increase in headache. The number of participants is also less than the optimal information size. The authors re- calculated their sample size after observing greater than expected variation in the frequency of headache, and estimated a sample of 600 would be required to demonstrate difference between groups. q. Peak expiratory flow (PEF) was measured in the morning prior to bronchodilator use. The mean control group value is the % PEF compared to baseline. r. Serious concerns ( -1) about indirectness. Results are for children 7- 16 years of age. Children 12 years and under comprise 66% (25/39) of the intervention group and 52% (22/42) of the comparator group. s. Very serious concerns ( -2) about imprecision. The 95% confidence interval includes an increase in PEF and a decrease in PEF, both of which are small but potentially important. The number of participants is also less than the optimal information size of approximately 400. t. Very serious concerns ( -2) about imprecision. 95% confidence interval includes a reduction in symptom days and a substantial increase. Number of participants is also less than optimal information size of approximately 400. u. Very serious concerns ( -2) about indirectness. Outcomes were measured 15 minutes post -treatment, which is unlikely to be a clinically important time-frame for this population. The outcome measured is muscle tone, which may be less important to patients than functional outco mes. v. Serious concerns ( -1) about imprecision. The 95% confidence interval includes a reduction in muscle spasticity and a trivial increase. The number of participants is also less than the optimal information size of approximately 400. w. Serious concerns ( -1) about risk of selection bias (unclear allocation concealment) and performance bias (patients, parents and provider s not blinded). x. Very serious concerns ( -2) about imprecision. 95% confidence interval includes a reduction in attention score and a substantial increase. Number of participants is also less than optimal information size of approximately 400. y. Seriou s concerns ( -1) about risk of selection bias (unclear randomisation and allocation concealment), and risk of performance bias (manual therapist saw infants in both groups and was unblinded to treatment group). z. Very serious ( -2) concerns about imprecisi on. The 95% confidence interval includes both a potentially important improvement in torticollis symptoms and worsening of symptoms. The number of events is also much less than the optimal information size (300). aa. In most studies, the sample size is li kely to be too small to detect less common adverse effects. The risk of bias across studies is very serious given that 9 trials did not mention (and potentially did not measure) adverse events. References 1. Wiberg, J. M., Nordsteen, J., Nilsson, N..

Systematic Review of Spinal Manipulation in Children Page 28 of 67 4.2 Safety review 4.2.1 Selection of studies We included 10 studies in the safety review ; nine were derived from Todd 2015 and one additional study was identified from the new searches (outside the period of the Todd search). One study (Sawyer 1999 (34) ) was included in both the effectiveness and the safety review. 4.2.1.1 Todd 2015 All studies included in Todd (n = 31) were checked for eligibility. Todd listed as included studies all the systematic and narrative reviews and commentarie s they used to source primary studies and reports of adverse events. We first excluded these reviews to ensure adverse events were not inc luded more than once, and focus ed only on the included primary studies (n = 25). Full -text reports of all primary studies (n = 25) were then screened for eligibility. Since the inclusion criteria for Todd were broader than those of this review ('cases of adverse effects due to chiropractic and other manual therapies for infants and children '), we excluded studies initially on the basis of age of participants (12 to 18 year olds), followed by an assessment of intervention techniques, and finally on whether the study report was available in English or had an English abstract. Figure 5 shows which primary studies were excluded at each stage and which studies met the eligibility criteria. Systematic Review of Spinal Manipulation in Children Page 29 of 67 Figure 5 . Flow chart of studies in Todd 2015 4.2.1.2 Search for additional primary studies We searched PubMed, Index to Chiropractic Literature, Embase, Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials, CINAHL, Allied and Complementary Medicine (AMED) and Scopus on 13 May 2019 (see Appendix 2). Further weekly searches of PubMed continued until 15 June 2019. After removing duplicates, 1628 records were screened. The full -text of 12 potentially eligible Systematic Review of Spinal Manipulation in Children Page 30 of 67 studies were checked. One additional study, not inclu ded in the Todd review, met our criteria and is included in this review (Awwad 2018 (39) ). The majority of studies excluded after full - text consideration were either editorials and commentaries, or were deemed to not be reporting information about spinal manipulation as we defined the intervention . Figure 6 shows the process of selection of studies for both those sourced from Todd and from the search for additional studies. Appendix 6 provides further detail of the reasons for exclusion of studies from both the Todd review and from the search for additional primary studies. Figure 6 . PRISMA flowchart (safety) Systematic Review of Spinal Manipulation in Children Page 31 of 67 4.2.1.3 Driehuis 2019 During the conduct of this review, following completion of the search, another systematic review of the effectiveness and safety of spinal manipulative therapy in infants, children and adolescents was published (Driehuis 2019 (2)). This review is described in section 4.1.1.2 and Appendix 4 of this report. Driehuis had broader, but overlapping, inclusion criteria compared to our review and included 18 studies describing harms (nine observational studies, five case reports and four controlled studies). We reviewed these included studies to identify any additional studies that met our inclusion criteria for intervention and age, and which added additional reports of adverse effects. No additional studies meeting our inclusion criteria were found. 4.2.1.4 Safety information derived from effectiveness review Of the 13 trials included in the effectiveness review, only four explicitly mentioned adverse effects (the remaining nine did not mention and may not have measured adverse effects and so do not contribute information to the safety review). Of these four studies, two expli citly reported no adverse effects, and two reported 'minimal self -limiting adverse effects' in infants and children undergoing SMT (Borusiak 2010 and Sawyer 1999), see Table 4. These effects were mid -back pain and irritability. Information about adverse ef fects derived from the effectiveness review is reported in the S ummary of F indings table for the effectiveness review (see Table 6 ) and reproduced below. Adverse events follow up: range immediate to >1 years Two trials, one on spinal pain and the other on asthma, reported that there were no adverse events. The trial on headache reported minor adverse events: hot skin (SMT 6 children, placebo sham 9), dizziness (SMT 7, placebo sham 4), transitory increase in headache intensity and frequency (SMT 8, placebo sham 6). The trial on otitis media reported 'minimal self -limiting' adverse events: mid-back pain (SMT 1), irritability (SMT 1), excessive crying (placebo 1). The remaining 9 trials did not report on adverse events (including the 3 trials on infant colic). 730 (13 RCTs) VERY LOW The evidence about adverse events from randomised trials is very uncertain. Nine of 13 trials included for the effectiveness review did not mention (and may not have measured) adverse events. The remaining four trials reported no or minor adverse events. In addition to inclusion in our eff ectiveness review, Sawyer 1999 is included in Todd, and hence further details of its reported adverse effects are in the results section be low. 4.2.2 Description of studies included in safety review We included 10 studies reporting 159 adverse effects. Full study details are presented in Table 7 below. Presenting conditions included conditions labelled as 'muscle tension, asymmetry and leg length discrepancy ' (3 studies), general presentations including wellness check ups (2 studies), torticollis , headache, neck pain, enuresis and otitis media (1 study each). Study designs were individual case reports presenting detail s of a single event (2 studies); a retrospective survey to identify incidence of adverse events followed by case reporting of a subset of identified events (1 study); practitioner surveys and audits (2 studies); case series (1 study ); prospective cohort studies (3 studies); cas e series (1 study) and a pilot randomised controlled trial (1 study). Practitioners delivering treatments were predominantly chiropractors (7 studies), with me dical manipulators (2 studies) and a physiotherapist (1 study) also included. Five studies were c onducted in the USA, three in Germany, and one each in Denmark and Australia. Systematic Review of Spinal Manipulation in Children Page 32 of 67 Table 7.

Systematic Review of Spinal Manipulation in Children Page 35 of 67 4.2.3 Safety review: summary across studies Full details of the study characteristics, results and the details of reported adverse effects are presented in T able 7. Overall, we identified few studies (10) and 159 reported adverse ef fects (including those measured as part of incident surveys but not fully described). Six of these studies aimed to determine the rates of adverse events occurring across populations of infants and children undergoing SMT. These studies reported rates span ning one minor treatment aggravation (muscle and spine stiffness and soreness) per 1812 consultations (Alcantara 2009) to 1 cerebro vascular incident in 20,000 visits (Klougart 1996). In two individual cohort studies, Koch et al . demonstrated apnoea and skin flushing in 50 of 199 treated infants; and severe but short lasting bradycardia in almost 50% of infants aged less than three months old and in 87 children aged over four months in an overall sample of 695. The only Australian study (Leboeuf 1991) reported two mild events (severe headache with stiff neck and acute lumbar spine pain) in 171 children undergoing treatment for enuresis. Four studies described five individual cases of adverse effect s from spinal manipulative therapy. Of these, three were classified as severe (Jacobi 2001, Klougart 1996 and L'Ecuyer 1959), and two as moderate (Awwad 2018). The moderate cases involved misdiagnosis and so delayed treatment of underlying conditions ( Perthes disease and developmental dislocation of the hip) . Of the three reports of a serious adverse event, one resulted in death of a three - month old , attributed to subarachnoid haemorrhage. The technique employed in this case was described as the Vojta technique and involved forced active rotation and head retr action (Jacobi 2001). Other serious adverse events were loss of consciousness with recovery (Klougart 1996 ) and hospitalisation for drowsiness and weakness (L'Ecuyer 1959 ). While other reviews with broader scope in terms of technique have reported more ser ious adverse effects, and attributed some to the presence of missed or undiagnosed underlying pathology, the three serious adverse events included in this review occurred in children with no reported underlying pathology (two case s) or congenital torticoll is (one report). 4.2.3 Safety review: compariso n with other systematic reviews With broader scope and inclusion criteria, Todd described 15 serious adverse events, inclu ding three deaths. Two of these deaths were reported in studies excluded f rom our revie w on the basis that the description of the technique used was unclear (Rageot 1968 c ase report published in German) or inconsis tent with our definition of spinal manipulation (Holla 2009 'forced, held flexion of the entire vertebral column by a craniosacral therapist not registered with the relevant national body'). Similarly, other studies included in Todd reporting other serious adverse events (e. g. neurological injury, ha emothorax) we re excluded from our review on the basis that the techniques used were not consistent with our definition of spinal manipulation or were not reported in sufficient detail to be included. Full details of our reasons for excluding studies are given in Appendix 6 . We were unable to include six studies in our review due to no details of the treatment used beyond describing it as spinal or chiropractic manipulation. Five of these were included in Todd ( Alcantara 2006 and 2007, Marchand 2012 , Miller 2008 and Ziv 1983) and one was identified through new searches (Deputy 2014). Unlike the findings of our review, Todd identified the presence of underlying existing pathologies that may contraindicate spinal manipulation as a key factor in serious adverse Systematic Review of Spinal Manipulation in Children Page 36 of 67 events, and emphasised the importance of excluding anatomical or neurological anomalies prior to performing manual techniques. This difference in results is likely due to Todd's inclusion of additional serious adverse effects on the basis of broader inclusion criteria . Based on their findings, Todd offers the following recommendations, which may be useful in informing panel deliberations: More comprehensive and accessible methods of reporting adverse events, both for practitioners and patients ; Practitioner education specific to paediatric populations ; Consideration of the amount of experience and additional training required for treatment of children to ensure appropriate technique selection and application. Driehuis 2019 undertook a systematic review of both effectiveness and harms of spinal manual therapy , including but not limited to high velocity, low a mplitude manipulations. This review details five case reports that described serious injury or death after HVLA manipulations in four infants and one child. All but one of these studies overlap with those of Todd , and includes the cases reported in our review . The additional study (Deputy 2014 (49) ) reports arm weakness in a six year -old boy. This study was identified by our search, but was excluded from our review based on insufficient information to determine the nature of the technique used (described as 'some degree of spinal manipulation of the neck'). With respect to potential harms associated with HVLA manipulation in children, consistent with our review, Driehuis concludes that because of the lack of reported information on the specific treatment techniques employed and the specific symptoms and indications for HVLA, conclusions about the risk of harm of spinal manipul ation are hard to draw. They call for researchers to include information about harms in their studies and to provide detailed information about the techniques used, including the training and qualifications of treating practitioners. They also highlight the need for continuous review of harms through observational studies, databases and registries. Systematic Review of Spinal Manipulation in Children Page 37 of 67 5. Coccygeal manipulation Separate to the review of spinal manipulation, we reviewed studies on the safety and effectiveness of coccygeal manipulation in children. Had we identified any relevant studies , we would have applied the same methods as with the spinal manipulation review. Criteria for in cluding studies Intervention any kind of manipulation or manual therapy of the coccyx delivered by any health professional Population children under 12 years of age Comparator any comparator Outcomes any outcome Study design Effectiveness: presence of a control or comparator group Safety: any design Other limits availability of full -text in English Search methods for identification of studies We searched PubMed, Index to Chiropractic Literature, Embase, Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials, CINAHL, Allied and Complementary Medicine (AMED) and Scopus on 28 May 2019 (see Appendix 7 ). No date limits were applied and the same search covered both effectiveness and safety. Results The searches re trieved 70 records (see Figure 7 ). We assessed three studies, none of which w as relevant. The table of excluded studies (Table 8) below details the reasons for exclusion. We therefore are unable to identify any studies reporting information about the effectiveness or safety of coccygeal manipulation in children. Table 8 .

Khorshid 2006 Cerebral palsy Intervention 'The percussion adjustment instrument is used in Atlas Orthogonal technique. The patient is placed on his [ sic] side with head support at four inches below the mastoid. A metal stylus is placed between the mastoid and the ramus of the mandible. An adjustment, an impulse imparted to the stylus by a plunger that excites a compressional wave in the stylus, is then delivered to the patient. At the patient- stylus interface, a portion of the wave energ y is transmitted to the patient and a portion is reflected back to the plunger. The former portion of energy is enough to direct the atlas vertebra to move to its normal orthogonal position.'

Cabrera - Marto s 2016 Cranial asymmetry Intervention Moulding and decompression techniques were used adapted to the previous assessment. The moulding techniques require a slow, gradual restoration of normal shape and function using the physiologic mechanisms to fac ilitate the body's response toward homeostasis. It was used to normalise the position and motion of the sacrum. Decompression techniques were used to normalise tissue around cranial sutures. The physical therapist guides the segments away from one another in a gentle distraction force maintaining this position until the tension released.'

Eligibility criteria are comprehensive, unambiguous and there are no important restrictions likely to bias the findings of the review. Concerns regarding methods used to identify and/or select studies LOW The search appears sufficiently comprehensive that it is unlikely that important studies will have been missed. Searching a trials register may have ensured no incompletely reported or ongoing trials were missed. Concerns regarding methods used to collect data and appraise studies LOW The data in many of the included studies is challenging to extract, with multiple outcomes, measures and time points, and hence there is potential for error because a single author extracted data. Although this is the case, the review authors' interpretation is cautious, and the certainty of evidence is low, hence concerns on this domain were rated as low since they were unlikely to alter the conclusions of the review. As noted by the review authors, the limited description of interventions in primary studies hampers interpretation of findings. Concerns regarding synthesis and findings LOW Studies are grouped for synthesis according to the pre - specified plan for the review and all relevant studies are included in the synth esis. Analysis methods are appropriate, and biases a re addressed in the synthesis. The only concern is that the authors have downgraded findings from single studies for inconsistency, which is contrary to GRADE guidance. In most instances, other concerns w ould lead to an equivalent or similar downgrading, however there is a possibility that the reported GRADE may be lower than necessary for some conditions. Describe whether conclusions were supported by the evidence: Overall, the review is judged to be of sound methodological quality. Did the interpretation of findings address all of the concerns identified in Domains 1 to 4? The review conclusions are appropriately cautiou s, and the evidence uncertain. For this reason is it is unlikely that any of the identified concerns are likely to change the conclusions of the review. Yes Was the relevance of identified studies to the review's research question appropriately considered? Study characteristics were carefully considered in the review and conclusions (including in GRADEing the evidence). The authors note that there is insufficient description of interventions in primary studies, which poses a challenge for interpretation of findings. Yes Did the review authors avoid emphasising results on the basis of their statistical significance? The authors appear to have avoided emphasising results based on statistical significance (i.e. highlighting results that were statistically significant over those that were not). Although not a bias, most results are reported as summary statistics for each treatment group. This makes the results more challenging to interpret and GRADE than if effect estimates and the precision of each estimate had been calcu lated (e.g. the difference in pain scores between the intervention and control groups). Yes Overall risk of bias LOW Systematic Review of Spinal Manipulation in Children Page 59 of 67 Detailed assessment for each domain Y=yes; PY=probably yes; N=no; PN=probably no; NI=no information DOMAIN 1: STUDY ELIGIBILITY CRITERIA Describe the study eligibility criteria, any restrictions on eligibility and whether there was evidence that objectives and eligibility criteria were pre -specified: 1.1 Did the review adhere to pre -defined objectives and eligibility criteria? The protocol was registered on PROSPERO; however, there is very little description of the planned methods. In contrast, the PICO criteria are comprehensively specified in the review which means that changes were made at some stage after registration of the review. It is likely that the PICO elements were specified in more detail during the review process, rather than changed in a way that might alter inclusion or synthesis decisions. For a review of this breadth, it is unlikely that the authors narrowed or broadened their criteria in a way that would alter the findings of the review. Y/PY/PN/N/NI 1.2 Were the eligibility criteria appropriate for the review question? The criteria seem appropriate and a clear rationale is provided for the way in which intervention techniques, population age groups, outcomes (effectiveness, harms), and study designs would be handled. Excluded population : studies that included both adults and children without stratification by age group (add file 1) Exclude intervention : Manual therapies with the primary focus on manipulating fractures (orthopedics), multiple body parts, extremities, fasciae, soft tissue, nervous system. (add file 1) Broader study design criteria were applied to the review of harms (including observational descriptive and case report studies), compared to effectiveness (controlled studies only) which is appropriate. Y/PY/PN/N/NI 1.3 Were eligibility criteria unambiguous? The eligibility criteria are clearly specified in the review for the purpose of determining study eligibility, but also for deciding how different intervention techniques, population groups (age), and outcomes would be handled in the synthesis . Y/PY/PN/N/NI 1.4 Were all restrictions in eligibility criteria based on study characteristics appropriate (e.g. date, sample size, study quality, outcomes measured)? There were no restrictions based on sample size or study quality. Note, only outcome d ata on harms were extracted from studies using an observational descriptive and case report design (which is appropriate, as indicated above). Y/PY/PN/N/NI 1.5 Were any restrictions in eligibility criteria based on sources of information appropriate (e.g . publication status or format, language, availability of data)? The review authors did not report any restrictions based on publications status (but only published studies, so this is likely) or availability of data. Excluded languages . Studies not published in English, Dutch or German (add file 1) Y/PY/PN/N/NI Concerns regarding specification of study eligibility criteria LOW /HIGH/ UNCLEAR Rationale for concern: The review was pre -registered. Eligibility criteria are comprehensive, unambiguous and there are no important restrictions likely to bias the findings of the review. Systematic Review of Spinal Manipulation in Children Page 60 of 67 DOMAIN 2: IDENTIFICATION AND SELECTION OF STUDIES Describe methods of study identifi cation and selection (e.g. number of reviewers involved): 2.1 Did the search include an appropriate range of databases/electronic sources for published and unpublished reports? PubMed, Index to Chiropractic Literature, Embase, CINAHL and Cochrane Library. No indication that the authors searched a trials register for unpublished or ongoing trials (which would be helpful for assessing reporting bias). Y/PY/PN/N/NI 2.2 Were methods additional to database searching used to identify relevant reports? Reference lists of included articles (p3) and identified systematic reviews (\"systematic reviews were not included, but studies embedded in these reviews were\" add file 1). Y/PY/PN/N/NI 2.3 Were the terms and structure of the search strategy likely to retrieve as many eligible studies as possible? Terms seem complete. There is one study in the SCV review which is not mentioned in either the list of included or excluded studies (Sawyer 1998). Y/PY/PN/N/NI 2.4 Were restrictions based on date, publication format, or language appropriate? Language . There were some language restrictions, but this is common practi ce, and studies in some languages other than English were eligible. Date . It appears that there were no restrictions by date, but this is not completely clear since the start date for searches/inclusion appears not to be reported. Publication format . It is unclear whether grey literature was eligible; however, the authors contacted study authors for further information (e.g. authors of the Bronfort et al study were contacted to request data for the comparator group). Y/PY/PN/N/NI 2.5 Were efforts made to minimise error in selection of studies? One author screened abstracts. Two independently screened full text. There is always a risk that studies may be missed when one author screens (depending on experience). However, for the effectiveness question, t he authors appear to have identified a similar set of studies to that identified for the SCV review, so it is unlikely that important studies were missed. Y/PY/PN/N/NI Concerns regarding specification of study eligibility criteria LOW/ HIGH/ UNCLEAR Rationale for concern: The search appears sufficiently comprehensive that it is unlikely that important studies will have been missed. Searching a trials register may have ensured no incompletely reported or ongoing trials were missed. Systematic Review of Spinal Manipulation in Children Page 61 of 67 DOMAIN 3: DATA COLLECTION AND STUDY APPRAISAL Describe methods of data collection, what data were extracted from studies or collected through other means, how risk of bias was assessed (e.g. number of reviewers involved) and the tool used to assess risk of bias: 3.1 Were efforts made to minimise error in data collection? A single author extracted data, with checks of a random sample of eight studies by a second author. There is some risk of error without a second author checking all data, although less so if the author is experienced. Y/PY/ PN/N/NI 3.2 Were sufficient study characteristics available for both review authors and readers to be able to interpret the results? The review authors have reported adequately (i.e. study PICO, risk of bias etc reported in tables and text). However, the review authors identify important gaps in the description of the interventions in the included studies (extract below). While not a limitation of the review methods (and not something that can be overcome by the review authors), item 3.2 requires judgement of whether the characteristics reported in primary studies were adequate for interpretation of findings. Given the review authors' description below, this appear not to be the case. \"We would like to highlight that for adequate interpretation it is of great importance that studies provide a detailed description of the SMT technique performed. Important information regarding the specific treatment technique was often omitted from publications. As a consequence, i t is challenging (or even impossible) for researchers and, maybe more importantly, healthcare professionals to interpret study findings and draw scientifically substantiated conclusions about effective treatment techniques . As such, this will hamper transl ation of study findings to clinical practice.\" (p16) Y/PY/ PN/N/NI 3.3 Were all relevant study results collected for use in the synthesis? In at least some circumstances, the authors appear to have requested data from primary study authors where the data were not available in the included paper. Y/PY/PN/N/NI 3.4 Was risk of bias (or methodological quality) formally assessed using appropriate criteria? Appropriate risk of bias tools were used for all study designs, and the assessments are completely reported (additional file 3). Y/PY/PN/N/NI 3.5 Were efforts made to minimise error in risk of bias assessment? Two authors independently assessed risk of bias. Y/PY/PN/N/NI Concerns regardi ng methods used to collect data and appraise studies LOW /HIGH/ UNCLEAR Rationale for concern: The data in many of the included studies is challenging to extract, with multiple outcomes, measures and time points, and hence there is potential for error because a single author extracted data. Although this is the case, the review authors' interpretati on is cautious, and the certainty of evidence is low, hence concerns on this domain were rated as low since they were unlikely to alter the conclusions of the review. As noted by the review authors, the limited description of interventions in primary studi es hampers interpretation of findings. Systematic Review of Spinal Manipulation in Children Page 62 of 67 DOMAIN 4: SYNTHESIS AND FINDINGS Describe synthesis methods: 4.1 Did the synthesis include all studies that it should? (see note re. item 4.3) Y/PY/PN/N/NI 4.2 Were all pre -defined analyses reported or departures explained? The analyses appear consistent with the protocol, which describes how studies will be grouped for analysis. The planned statistical methods are not described in the protocol; however, the methods used reflect standard practice an d the analyses are limited to one condition, which is consistent with available data and hence does not raise concern. Y/PY/PN/N/NI 4.3 Was the synthesis appropriate given the nature and similarity in the research questions, study designs and outcomes ac ross included studies? With the exception of one condition (colic, 4 studies), all conclusions are based on single studies (i.e. not meta -analysis), so this item is only relevant for findings for colic. The authors judged that the comparators used were too different to pool all four studies, so decided to pool only the two studies with a sham or no intervention comparator. This is acceptable. Y/PY/PN/N/NI 4.4 Was between -study variation (heterogeneity) minimal or addressed in the synthesis? With the exception of one condition (colic), all conclusions are based on results from single studies, so this item is only relevant for findings for colic. The authors report heterogeneity statistics and considered inconsistency when drawing conclusions, which is appropriate. For results for conditions other than colic, the authors downgraded the certainty of evidence from single studies for 'very serious inconsistency'. This is contrary to GRADE guidance which advises not to downgrade single studies for i nconsistency. Y/PY/PN/ N/NI 4.5 Were the findings robust, e.g. as demonstrated through funnel plot or sensitivity analyses? Insufficient data to do these analyses. Reporting bias may be a concern in these studies, but cannot be assessed from the data ava ilable to the review authors. Y/PY/PN/N/ NI 4.6 Were biases in primary studies minimal or addressed in the synthesis? The risk of bias was assessed for each study, reported in tables, and considered in the GRADE assessment of the certainty of the evidence. The certainty of evidence was reported in all relevant places in the review, including the abstract. Y/PY/PN/N/NI Concerns regarding the synthesis and findings LOW /HIGH/ UNCLEAR Rationale for concern: Studies are grouped for synthesis according to the pre -specified plan for the review and all relevant studies are included in the synthesis. Analysis methods are appropriate, and biases are addressed in the synthesis. The only concern is that the authors have downgraded fin dings from single studies for inconsistency, which his contrary to GRADE guidance. In most instances, other concerns would lead to an equivalent or similar downgrading, however there is a possibility that the reported GRADE may be lower than necessary for some conditions. Systematic Review of Spinal Manipulation in Children Page 63 of 67 Appendix 5 - Intervention description table for effectiveness studies Author/ year Description of intervention/ technique Description of comparator Browning 2008 Colic Two weeks of spinal manipulative therapy appropriate for neonates and appropriate to the age of the patient as indicated on examination Two weeks of occipital -sacral decompression is a chiropractic paediatric technique for infants. With the infant supine the occiput and the sacral base are co ntacted simultaneously and gentle distraction is applied for up to 30 s. It is not a cranial technique but rather a technique that affords gentle spinal distraction. Olafsdottir 2001 Colic Palpation of the infant's spinal articulations with respect to areas of dysfunction. Dysfunctional articulations were manipulated and mobilised using light fingertip pressure. The treatment was given three times, at intervals of two to five days, for a per iod of eight days. Infants were held by the nurse for 10 minutes (the approximate time of treatment) after being partially undressed in a similar way as treated infants. Wiberg 1999 Colic Physical examination performed, including motion palpation of the articulations of vertebral column and pelvis. Those articulations found to be restricted in movement were manipulated/ mobilized with specific light pressure with the fingertips for a period of up to 2 weeks (3 to 5 treatment sessions) until normal mob ility was found in the involved segments. Dimethicone daily for 2 weeks as prescribed in the Danish PDR. Reed 1994 Enuresis Patients with spinal subluxation were adjusted utilizing a high velocity, short lever thrust. Two 5th year chiropractic stude nts performed the adjustments consistent with Palmer Package Adjusting Technique under the direct supervision and assistance of two clinical faculty. The sham adjustment consisted of using an Activator at nontension setting administered to the examiner's own underlying contact point (i.e., thumb/finger) over the thoracic area. Dissing 2018 Back/neck pain High -velocity, low - amplitude manipulation and/or mobilisation of the joints to restore segmental spinal motion, delivered at the discretion of the chiropractor. Pragmatic advice (activity level, ergonomics, cold packs, etc); Exercises (stretching and/or strengthening exercises); Soft- tissue tre atment (manual trigger point therapy or massage) Borusiak 2010 Headache Patients were lying on the side and a cervical high- velocity, low -amplitude lateral directed manipulation without rotation or extension was performed. Forces of this intervention are known and vary from 50 Nm in newborns and infants to 350 Nm in adults. Light touch of specific spinal segments so that the placebo treatment was identical to the active treatment except for the low -amplitude, high- velocity thrust, given the impressio n of a cervical manipulation that however was not directed to correct the assumed cervical blockage. Bronfort 2001 Asthma Manipulation of dysfunctional joints of the spine and pelvis was carried out with the patient placed on a chiropractic treatment table with separate cushion sections for the cervical, thoracic, and lumbar spine. Drop mechanisms are built into these sections, enabling them to be quickly released and lowered 2 to 3 cm when the force from the manual treatment exceeds a certain preset l evel according to the weight of the patient. This technique is used to facilitate and accentuate the specific manual treatment. The manual spinal thrusting technique used a specific contact over a vertebral osseous process, muscle, or ligament and introduc ed a force into the selected vertebral or sacroiliac joint. This manual spinal treatment was carried out with a high -velocity, low -amplitude thrust, most commonly by means of a short -lever technique. Patients in the sham manipulation group received light manual contact to the spine with no manipulative thrust. The sham treatment consisted of gentle manual pressure over a spinal contact point with one hand, while the other hand pushed on the drop section with the purpose of releasing it. As a result of this procedure, the patient experienced a rapid, momentary change in position of the spinal section under influence, similar to an active treatment. Balon 1999 Asthma The specifics of treatment for each subject (vertebral segments treated, direction and type of manipulation, and use of soft- tissue therapy) were determined by the treating chiropractor. All the chiropractors used the diversified technique in common use in Canada and the United States, which involves manual contact with spinal or pelvic joints followed by a low -amplitude, high - velocity directional push often associated with joint opening, creating a cavitation, or \"pop\". A distraction maneuver was performed by turning the subject's head from one side to the other while alternately palpating the ankles and feet. The subject was positioned on one side, a nondirectional push, or impulse, was applied to the gluteal region, and the procedure was repeated with the subject positioned on the other side; then the subject was placed in the prone position, and a similar impulse was applied Systematic Review of Spinal Manipulation in Children Page 64 of 67 Author/ year Description of intervention/ technique Description of comparator The subjects visited the selected chiropractor three times weekly for four weeks, twice weekly for four wee ks, then weekly for eight weeks, with each subject required to receive between 20 and 36 treatments during the four -month study. bilaterally to the scapulae. The subject was then placed supine, with the head rotated slightly to each side, and an impulse applied to the external occipital protuberance. Low -amplitude, low - velocity impulses were applied in all these nontherapeutic contacts, with adequate joint slack so that no joint opening or cavitation occurred. Sawyer 1999 Otitis media SMT was applied to the full spine, with emphasis on the upper cervical area. The areas treated were determined by the clinician using manual static and motion palpation. Treatment consisted of low -amplitude, high -velocity manual spinal manipulation applied to specific spinal segments. Manual static and motion palpation and light touch of specific spinal segments so that the placebo treatment was identical to the active treatment except for the low -amplitude, high- velocity thrust. Kachmar 2018 Cerebral palsy Average duration of SM was ~ 5 minutes. Thoracic manipulation was performed in prone position by applying postero -anterior pressure to take up the slack along with a counterclockwise rotation force driving the right hand away from the left. High -velocity, low -amplitude thrust was then applied in the vertical direction while the participant exhaled. Lumbar spine manipulation was performed in lateral recumbent position with the upper leg flexed at the hip and knee, the lower leg straight, and lumbar spine placed in slight extension. Joint pretension produced by the rotational forc e was applied to the shoulder and thigh. High -velocity, low -amplitude thrust was delivered, targeting the facet joints in a posterior to anterior direction. Cervical spine manipulation was conducted in a seated position with the head flexed sideways and slightly rotated and the weight of the head supported by the practitioner's hand. Traction and side -bending force were employed, and when the slack was taken out and this premanipulation position was determined to be comfortable, a high -velocity, low -ampli tude thrust was applied. Lumbar and cervical manipulations were performed symmetrically on both right and left side. Participants were placed in the same positions and performing movements identical to those performed during SM, but without applying substantial force. Accorsi 2014 Hyper - activity OMT techniques were chosen according to each participant's needs, as well as the physical condition and age of the participant. Manipulative techniques used included myofascial release, craniosacral , balan ced ligamentous tension, and balanced membranous tension. The sequence and dose of OMT techniques were left to the discretion of the osteopaths and not based on a predetermined protocol. Participants allocated to the intervention group received six 40 -minute OMTh sessions. Conventional care, including drug therapy and psychosocial interventions. Conventional care, including drug therapy and psychosocial interventions. Giesen 1989 Hyper - activity Light but specific high -velocity, low -amplitude thrusts for the correction of chiropractic intervertebral subluxation complexes. All were treated by standard diversified and Gonstead techniques, with the intervention selective for the specific spinal dysarthrias detected by examination. Placebo treatm ent at baseline using nonspecific contact points and avoidance of specific spinal dysarthrias. Use of mechanical device to make 'popping' sound. Same \"gentle touch\" before and after treatment as received during actual intervention. Haugen 2011 Torticoll is Manipulation is conducted with the child supine and the head in neutral position, without extension of any structures. Only very moderate force is used. Child physiotherapy (see comparator description). Child physiotherapy. The primary health care physiotherapists who followed up the children at home were instructed not to stretch the neck against resistance from the child. The main focus was encouragement of symmetrical motor performance through a variety of methods.
