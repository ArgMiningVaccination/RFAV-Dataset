If you have osteoporosis, you may be at a higher risk for fractures. To prevent injury, it's important to take steps to slow the progression of bone loss and protect your spine. Osteoporosis Osteoporosis is a condition where the bones in the spine become weak and brittle. This leads to an increased risk of fractures. Bones can become so fragile that mild movements like coughing or bending over can result in a fracture. Most common osteoporosis fractures occur in the hip, spine or wrist. Osteoporosis causes Our bodies continually make material to replace old bone. As we age, our bodies can't keep up with the demand of bones wearing down. So, new bones are not replacing the old bone, leaving bones more fragile than normal. Osteoporosis symptoms Osteoporosis symptoms often don't appear until bones are weakened. Some of the symptoms of osteoporosis include: - Back pain - Bone that easily breaks - Loss of height - Stooped posture Osteoporosis treatment To treat osteoporosis, doctors commonly follow a conservative approach. This includes: - Physical therapy - The first step in managing pain and other symptoms is physical therapy. A certified physical therapist will teach you stretches and strengthening exercises to improve flexibility and stability of the spine, strengthen muscles and reduce pain. - Medicine - Medication can help slow bone loss and even improve bone density. Your doctor will talk to about the right medication, but it may include intravenous medication, injections, hormones or oral medication. Your treatment plan may also include lifestyle modifications to reduce your risk of fractures. To improve your bone health: - Maintain a healthy weight - Eat a healthy, well-balanced diet - Get plenty of exercise - Quit smoking - Avoid excessive alcohol intake If you do experience complications from osteoporosis, such as a [herniated disc](/institutes-and-services/trihealth-orthopedic-and-sports-institute/what-hurts/neck-and-back/herniated-disc), [spinal stenosis](/institutes-and-services/trihealth-orthopedic-and-sports-institute/what-hurts/neck-and-back/spinal-stenosis) or fractured vertebra, the TriHealth and [Beacon Orthopaedics & Sports Medicine](https://www.beaconortho.com/) can help you find relief with treatment tailored to your condition.
