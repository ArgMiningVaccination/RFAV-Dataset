When they say \"Driver Friendly\" they really mean it, it's a extremely relaxing environment.. Everyone was very patient and helpful.. I suffer from white coat syndrome this was the very first D.O.T. Physical exam I took where I felt comfortable from the moment I check in until I was completely done.. - 8/27/2022 We love A-Z! Everyone is very friendly and helpful. They communicate great not only with me but my children. - 2/11/2022 Best chiropractic office! Whole staff, from reception, management and all the doctors and therapists, are all so amazing. Everyone is friendly and responsive. Office is very clean and inviting. Chiropractors are extremely attentive to your exact needs and clear and concise on what treatment you will need. Never had a question that wasn't answered with a detailed, thorough explanation. Treatments are amazing and I always leave feeling 100% better. My kids are also adjusted and they love Dr Zach and Ms Danielle and love going to the office. Definitely would recommend this chiropractor! - 8/16/2018 We are so lucky that we found Dr. Zach and his team. He started seeing my 8 year old son for headaches that he had for months on end. My son had MRI's, medication and testing and found nothing. After a few short weeks of seeing Dr. Zach, the headaches slowly disappeared. My son loves seeing Dr. Zach! - 5/25/2018First to Review Dr. Zach is great with patients of all ages. You can tell he is passionate about getting his patients better as quick as possible. Everything from torticollis in infants to headaches and neck pain to sports injuries. He goes way beyond what a normal chiropractor does and I feel confident that he will help anyone I send his way.
