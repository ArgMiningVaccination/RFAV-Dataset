NAME OF THE MEDICINAL PRODUCT Dovato 50 mg/300 mg film -coated tablets 2. QUALITATIVE AND QUANTITATIVE COMPOSITION Each film -coated tablet contains dolutegravir sodium equivalent to 50 mg dolutegravir and 300 mg lamivudine . For the full list of excipients, see section 6.1. 3. PHARMACEUTICAL FORM Film -coated tablet (tablet). Oval, biconvex, white, film coated tablet, approximately 18.5 x 9.5 mm, debossed with \"SV 137\" on one face . 4. CLINICAL PARTICULARS 4.1 Therapeutic indications Dovato is indicated for the treatment of Human Immunodeficiency Virus type 1 (HIV -1) infection in adults and adolescents above 12 years of age weighing at least 40 kg, with no known or suspected resistance to the integrase inhibitor class, or lamivudine (see sec tion 5.1). 4.2 Posology and method of administration Dovato should be prescribed by physicians experienced in the management of HIV infection. Posology Adults and adolescents ( above 12 years of age weighing at least 40 kg). The recommended dose of Dovato in adults and adolescents is one 50 mg/300 mg tablet once daily . Dose adjustments A separate preparation of dolutegravir is available where a dose adjustment is indicated due to drug -drug interactions ( efavirenz, nevirapine, or tipranavir/ritonavir, see section s 4.4 and 4.5). In these cases the physician should refer to the individual produc t information for dolutegravir. Missed doses If the patient misses a dose of Dovato, the patient should take Dovato as soon as possible, providing the next dose is not due within 4 hours. If the next dose is due within 4 hours, the patient should not take the missed dose and simply resume the usual dosing schedule . Elderly There are limited data available on the use of Dovato in patients aged 65 years and over. No dose adjustment is necessary (see section 5.2). Renal impairment 3 Dovato is not recommended for use in patients with a creatinine clearance < 30 mL/min (see section 5.2). No dose adjustment is required in patie nts with mild or moderate renal impairment. However, the lamivudine exposure is significantly increased in patients with a creatinine clearance < 50 mL/min (see section 4.4). Hepatic impairment No dosage adjustment is required in patients with mild or moderate hepatic impairment (Child -Pugh grade A or B). No data are available in patients with severe hepatic impairment (Child -Pugh grade C) ; therefore Dovato should be used with caution in these patients (see section 5.2). Paediatric population The safety and efficacy of Dovato in children aged less than 12 years or weighing less than 40 kg have not been established. No data are available. Method of administration Oral use. Dovato can be taken with or without food (see section 5.2). 4.3 Contraindications Hypersensitivity to the active substances or to any of the excipients listed in section 6.1. Co-administration with medicinal products with narrow therapeutic windows, that are substrates of organic cation transporter (OCT ) 2, including but not limited to fampridine ( also known as dalfampridine; see section 4.5). 4.4 Special warnings and precautions for use Hypersensi tivity reactions Hypersensitivity reactions have been reported with dolutegravir , and were characterized by rash, constitutional findings, and sometimes, organ dysfunction, including severe liver reactions. Dovato and other suspect medicinal product s should be discontinued immediately if signs or symptoms of hypersensitivity reactions develop (including, but not limited to, severe rash or rash accompanied by raised liver enzymes, fever, general malaise, fatigue, muscle or joint aches, blisters, oral lesions, conjunctivitis, facial oedema, eosinophilia, angioedema). Clinical status including liver aminotransferases and bilirubin should be monitored. Delay in stopping treatment with Dovato or other suspect active substances after the onset of hypersensitivity may result in a life -threatening allergic reaction . Weight and metabolic parameters An increase in weight and in levels of blood lipids and glucose may occur during antiretroviral therapy. Such changes may in part be linked to disease control and lifestyle. For lipids and weight , there is in some cases evidence for a treatment effect . For monitoring of blood lipids and glucose reference i s made to established HIV treatment guidelines. Lipid disorders should be managed as clinically appropriate. Liver disease Patients with chronic hepatitis B or C and treated with combination antiretroviral therapy are at an increased risk of severe and p otentially fatal hepatic adverse reactions. In case of concomitant antiviral therapy for hepatitis B or C, please refer also to the relevant product informatio n for these medicinal products. 4 Dovato includes lamivudine, which is active against hepatitis B. Dolutegravir lacks such activity. Lamivudine monotherapy is generally not considered an adequate treatment for hepatitis B, since the risk for hepatitis B resistance development is high. If Dovato is used in patients co -infected with hepatitis B an additi onal antiviral is therefore generally needed. Reference should b e made to treatment guidelines. If Dovato is discontinued in patients co- infected with hepatitis B virus, periodic monitoring of both liver function tests and markers of HBV replication is re commended, as withdrawal of lamivudine may result in an acute exacerbation of hepatitis. Patients with pre -existing liver dysfunction, including chronic active hepatitis have an increased frequency of liver function abnormalities during combination antiretroviral therapy, and should be monitored according to standard practice. If there is evidence of worsening liver disease in such patients, interruption or discontinuation of treatment must be considered. Immune Reactivation Syndrome In HIV -infected patients with severe immune deficiency at the time of institution of combination antiretroviral therapy (CART), an inflammatory reaction to asymptomatic or residual opportunistic pathogens may arise and cause serious clinical conditions, or a ggravation of symptoms. Typically, such reactions have been observed within the first few weeks or months of initiation of CART. Relevant examples are Cytomegalovirus retinitis , generalised and/or focal mycobacterial infections, pneumonia (often referred to as PCP) . Any inflammatory symptoms should be evaluated and treatment instituted when necessary. Autoimmune disorders (such as Graves' disease and autoimmune hepatitis ) have also been reported to occur in the setting of immune r eactivation; however, the reported time to onset is more variable and these events can occur many months after initiation of treatment. Liver chemistry elevations consistent with immune reconstitution syndrome were observed in some hepatitis B and/or C co -infected patients at the start of dolutegravir therapy. Monitoring of liver chemistries is recommended in patients with hepatitis B and/or C co -infection. (See ' Liver disease ' earlier in this section and also see section 4.8). Mitochondrial dysfunction following exposure in utero Nucleoside and nucleotide analogues may impact mitochondrial function to a variable degree, which is most pronounced with stavudine, didanosine and zidovudine. There have been reports of mitochondrial dysfunction in HIV -negative infants exposed in utero and/or post -natally to nucleoside analogues, these have predominantly concerned treatment with regimens containing zidovudine. The main adverse reactions reported are haematological disorders (anaemia, n eutropenia), and metabolic disorders (hyperlactatemia, hyperlipasemia). These reactions have often been transitory. Some late- onset neurological disorders have been reported rarely (hypertonia, convulsion, abnormal behaviour). Whether such neurological dis orders are transient or permanent is currently unknown. These findings should be considered for any child exposed in utero to nucleoside and nucleotide analogues, who presents with severe clinical findings of unknown aetiology, particularly neurologic find ings. These findings do not affect current national recommendations to use antiretroviral therapy in pregnant women to prevent vertical transmission of HIV. Osteonecrosis Although the aetiology is considered to be multifactorial (including corticosteroid use, biphosphonates, alcohol consumption, severe immunosuppression, higher body mass index), cases of osteonecrosis have been reported in patients with advanced HIV -disease and/or long -term exposure to CART. Patients should be advised to see k medical advice if they experience joint aches and pain, joint stiffness or difficulty in movement. Opportunistic infections 5 Patients should be advised that dolutegravir , lamivud ine or any other antiretroviral therapy does not cure HIV infection and tha t they may still develop opportunistic infections and other complications of HIV infection. Therefore, patients should remain under close clinical observation by physicians experienced in the treatment of these associated HIV diseases. Administration in subjects with moderate renal impairment Patients with a creatinine clearance between 30 and 49 mL/min receiving D ovato may experience a 1.6- to 3.3-fold higher lamivudine exposure (AUC) than patients with a creatinine clearance 50 mL/min. There are no saf ety data from randomized, controlled trials comparing D ovato to the individual components in patients with a creatinine clearance between 30 and 49 mL/min who received dose -adjusted lamivudine. In the original lamivudine registrational trials in combinatio n with zidovudine, higher lamivudine exposures were associated with higher rates of ha ematologic toxicities (neutropenia and an aemia), although discontinuations due to neutropenia or ana emia each occurred in <1% of subjects. Other lamivudine -related advers e events (such as gastro -intestinal and hepatic disorders) may occur. Patients with a sustained creatinine clearance between 30 and 49 mL/min who receive D ovato should be monitored for lamivudine -related adverse events, notably ha ematologic toxicities. If new or worsening neutropenia or ana emia develop, a dose adjustment of lamivudine, per lamivudine prescribing information, is indicat ed, which cannot be achieved with Dovato. D ovato should be discontinued and the individual components should be used to con struct the treatment regimen. Drug i nteractions The recommended dose of dolutegravir is 50 mg twice daily when co- administered with carbamazepine, oxcarbazepine tipranavir/ritonavir (see section 4.5 antacids. P olyvalent cation- containing antacids are recommended to be taken 2 hours after or 6 hours before Dovato (see section 4.5). When taken with food, Dovato and supplements or multivitamins containing calcium, iron or magnesium can be taken at the same time. If Dovato is administered under fasting c onditions, supplements or multivitamins containing calcium, iron or magnesium are recommended to be taken 2 hours after or 6 hours before Dovato (see section 4.5). Dolutegravir increased metformin concentrations. A dose adjustment of metformin should be c onsidered when starting and stopping coadministration of Dovato with metformin, to maintain glycaemic control (see section 4.5). Metformin is eliminated renally and, therefore , it is of importance to monitor renal function when co- treated with Dovato . This combination may increase the risk for lactic acidosis in patients with moderate renal impairment (stage 3a creatinine clearance 45 - 59 mL/min) and a cautious approach is recommended. Reduction of the metformin dose should be highly considered. The combination of Dovato with cladribine is not recommended (see section 4.5). Dovato should not be taken with any other medicinal product containing dolutegravir , lamivudine or emtricitabine , except where a dose adjustment of dolutegravir is indicated d ue to drug- drug interactions (see section 4.5). 4.5 Interaction with other medicinal products and other forms of interaction No drug interaction studies have been conducted us ing Dovato. Dovato contains dolutegravir and lamivudine, therefore any interactions identified for these individually are relevant to Dovato . No clinically significant drug interactions are expected between dolutegravir and lamivudine. 6 Effect of o ther medicinal products on the pharmacokinetics of dolutegravir and lamivudine Dolutegravir is CYP3A4, P -glycoprotein (P -gp), and breast cancer resistance protein (BCRP). Co -administration of Dovato and other medicinal products that inhibit UGT1A1, UGT1A3, UGT1A9, CYP3A4, and/or P -gp may, therefore, increase dolutegravir plasma concentration . Medicinal products that induce those enzymes or transporters may decrease dolutegravir plasma concentration and reduce the therapeutic effect of dolutegravir . The absorption of dolutegravir is reduced by certain metal cation -containing anti -acid substance s and supplements (see Table 1). Lamivudine is cleared renally. Active renal secretion of lamivudine in the urine is mediated through the OCT2 and multidrug and toxin extrusion transporters (MATE1 and MATE2- K). Trimethoprim (an inhibitor of these transporters) has been shown to increase lamivudine plasma concentrations, however the resulting increase was not clinically significant (see Table 1). Dolutegravir is an OCT2 and MATE1 inhibitor; however, lamivudine concentrations were similar with or without co- administration of dolutegravir based on a cross study analysis, indicating that dolutegravir has no relevant effect on lamivudine exposure in vivo . Lamivudine i s also substrate of the hepatic uptake transporter OCT1. As hepatic elimination plays a minor role in the clearance of lamivudine, drug interactions due to inhibition of OCT1 are unlikely to be of clinical significance. Although lamivudine is a substrate of BCRP and P -gp in vitro , given its high absolute bioavailability, (see section 5.2), inhibitors of these efflux transporters are unlikely to result in a clinically relevant impact on lamivudine concentrations. Effect o f dolutegravir and lamivudine on the pharmacokinetics of other medicinal products In vivo , dolutegravir did not have an effect on midazolam, a CYP3A4 probe. Based on in vivo and/or in vitro data, dolutegravir is not expected to affect the pharmacokinetics of medicinal products that are substrates of any major enzyme or transporter such as CYP3A4, CYP2C9 and P -gp (for more information see section 5.2). In vitro , dolutegravir inhibited the renal transporters OCT2 and MATE1. In , a 10- 14% decrease of creatinine clearance (secretory fraction is dependent on OCT2 and MATE1 transport) was observed in patients. In vivo , dolutegravir may increase plasma concentrati ons of medicinal products in which excretion is dependent upon OCT2 and/or MATE1 (e.g. fampridine [ also known as dalfampridine] , metformin) (see Table 1 and section 4.3). In vitro , dolutegravir inhibited the renal uptake organic anion transporters (OAT)1 and OAT3. Based on the lack of effect on the in vivo pharmacokinetics of the OAT substrate tenofovir, in vivo inhibition of OAT1 is unlikely. Inhibition has not been studied in vivo . Dolutegravir may increase plasma concentrations of medic inal products in which excretion is dependent upon OAT3. In vitro, lamivudine wa s an inhibitor of OCT1 and OCT2; the clinical consequences are not known. Established and theoretical interactions with selected antiretrovirals and non -antiretroviral me dicinal products are listed in T able 1. Interaction table Interactions between dolutegravir, lamivudine and co- administered medical products are listed in Table 1 (increase is indicated as \"\", decrease as \"\", no change as \"\", area under the concentration versus time curve as \"AUC\", maximum observed concentration as \"C max\", concentration at end of dosing interval as \"C\"). The table should not be considered exhaustive but is representative of the classes studied. Table 1: Drug Interactions 7 Medicinal products by therapeutic areas Interaction geometric mean change (%) Recommendations concerning co - administration Antiretroviral medicinal products Non-nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors Etravirine without boosted without boosted protease inhibitors decreased plasma dolutegravir concentration. The recommended dose of dolutegravir is 50 mg twice daily for patients taking etravirine without boosted protease inhibitors. As Dovato is a fixed -dose tablet, an additional 50 mg tablet of dolutegravir should be administered, a pproximately 12 hours after Dovato for the durati on of the etravirine without boosted protease inhibitor co- administrati on (a separate formulation of dolutegravir is available for this dose adjustment, see section 4.2). Lopinavir+ritonavir+etravirine/ Dolutegravir (induction of UGT1A1 and CYP3A enzymes) The recommended dose of dolutegravir is 50 mg twice daily when co-administered with efaviren z. As Dovato is a fixed -dose tablet, an additional 50 mg tablet of dolutegravir should be administered, a pproximately 12 hours after Dovato for the duration of the efavirenz co-administration (a separate formulation of dolutegravir is available for this dose adjustment, see section 4.2) . Nevirapine/Dolutegravir Dolutegravir (Not studied, a similar reduction in exposure as observed with efavirenz is expected, due to induction) The recommended dose of dolutegravir is 50 mg twice daily when co-administered with nevirapine. As Dovato is a fixed -dose tablet, an additional 50 mg tablet of dolutegravir should be administered, a pproximately 12 hours after Dovato for the duration of the nevirapine co-administrati on (a 8 separate form ulation of dolutegravir is available for this dose adjustment, see section 4.2) . Rilpivirine Tenofovir Interaction not studied No dose adjustment is necessary when Dovato is combined with tenofovir , didanosine, stavudine or zidovudine . Dovato is not recommended for use in combination with emtricitabine containing products, since both lamivudine (in Dovato) and emtricitabine are cytidine analogues (i.e. Protease controls) (inhibition of UGT1A1 and CYP3A and CYP3A enzymes) The recommended dose of dolutegravir is 50 mg twice daily when co administered with tipranavir/ritonavir. As Dovato is a fixed -dose tablet, an additional 50 mg tablet of dolutegravir should be administered, a pproximately 12 hours after Dovato for the duration of the tipranavir/ritonavir co-administrati on (a separate form ulation of dolutegravir is available for this dose adjustment, see section 4.2) . Fosamprenavir+ritonavir/ decreases dolutegravir concentrations, but based on limited data, did not result in decreased efficacy in Phase III studies. No dose adjustment is necessary. 9 Ritonavir (induction UGT1A1 and CYP3A enzymes) No dose adjustment is necessary. Other antiviral active substances Daclatasvir/Dolutegravir Dolutegravir AUC 33% C did not change dolutegravir plasma concentration to a clinically relevant extent. Dolutegravir did not change daclatasvir plasma concentration. No dose adjustment is necessary. Ledipasvir/Sofosbuvir / Lamivudine (with abacavir) Velpatasvir No dosage adjustment necessary. Ribavirin Interaction not studied. Clinically significant interaction unlikely. No dosage adjustment necessary. Anti -infective products Trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole (Co-trimoxazole)/Lamivudine (160 mg/800 mg once daily for 5 days/300 54% max 43% C 72% The recommended dose of dolutegravir is 50 mg twice daily when co-administered with rifampicin. As Dovato is a fixed- dose tablet, an additional 50 mg tablet of dolutegravir 10 (induction of UGT1A1 and CYP3A enzymes) should be administered, a pproximately 12 hours after Dovato for the duration of the rifampicin co-administrati on (a separate formulation of dolutegra vir is available for this dose adjustment, see section 4.2) . Rifabutin Dolutegravir AUC 49% C max 33% C 73% The recommended dose of dolutegravir is 50 mg twice daily when co-administered with these metabolic inducers. As Dovato is a fixed- dose tablet, an additional 50 mg tablet of dolutegravir should be administered, approximately 12 hours after Dovato for the duration of the co- administrati on with these metabolic inducers (a separate formulation of dolutegravir is available for this dose adjustment, see section 4.2). Phenobarbital/Dolutegravir Phenytoin/Dolutegravir Oxcarbazepine/Dolutegravir Dolutegravir (Not studied, decrease expected due to induction of UGT1A1 and CYP3A enzymes, a similar reduction in exposure as observed with carbamazepine is expected ). Antihistamines (histamine H2 receptor antagonists) Ranitidine Interaction not studied. Clinically significant interaction unlikely. No dosage adjustment necessary. Cimetidine Interaction not studied. Clinically significant interaction unlikely. No dosage adjustment necessary. Cytotoxics Cladribine/Lamivudine Interaction not studied. In vitro lamivudine inhibits the intracellular phosphorylation of cladribine leading to a potential risk of cladribine loss of efficacy in case of combination in the clinical setting. Some clinical findings also support a possible interaction between lamivudine an d cladribine . Concomitant use of Dovato with cladribine is not recommended (see section 4.4). Miscellaneous Sorbitol 11 Sorbitol solution (3.2 g, 10.2 g, 13.4 g)/Lamivudine Single dose lamivudine oral of Dovato with medicinal products containing sorbitol or of HIV -1 viral load when chronic coadministration cannot be avoided. Potassium channel blockers Fampridine (also known as dalfampridine )/Dolutegravir Fampridine Co-administration of dolutegravir has the potential to cause seizures due to increased fampridine plasma concentration via inhibition of OCT2 transporter; co -administration has not been studied. Fampridine co- administration with Dovato is contraindicated (see section 4. -containing antacids should be taken well separated in time from the administration of Dovato (minimum 2 hours after or 6 hours before). Calcium supplements/Dolutegravir (fasted intake) Dolutegravir AUC 39% C max 37% C 24 39% (Complex binding to polyvalent ions) - When taken with food , Dovato and supplements or multivitamins containing calcium, iron or magnesium can be taken at the same time. - If Dovato is taken in a fasted state , such supplements should be taken a minimum 2 hours after or 6 hours before the intake of Dovato. The stated reductions in dolutegravir exposure were observed with the intake of dolutegravir and these supplements during fasted conditions. In fed state, the changes in exposure following intake together with calcium or iron supplements were modified by the f ood effect, resulting in an exposure similar to that obtained with dolutegravir administered in the fasted state. Iron supplements/Dolutegravir (fasted intake) Dolutegravir AUC 54% C max 56% (Complex polyvalent ions) Multivitamins AUC 33% C polyvalent ions) Proton C is necessary. Antidiabetics Metformin/Dolutegravir Metformin Dolutegravir A dose adjustment of metformin should be considered when starting and stopping coadministration of Dovato 12 When co -administered with 111% with metformin, to maintain glycaemic control. In patients with moderate renal impairment a dose adjustment of metformin should be considered when coadministered with Dovato , because of the increased risk for lactic acidosis in patients with moderate renal impairment due to increased metformin concentration (section 4.4). Herbal products St. John's wort/Dolutegravir Dolutegravir (Not studied, decrease expected due to induction of UGT1A1 and CYP3A enzymes, a similar reduction in exposure as observed with carbamazepine is expected) . The recommended dose of dolutegravir is 50 mg twice daily when co- administered with St. John's wort. As Dovato is a fixed- dose tablet, an additional 50 mg tablet of dolutegravir should be administered, a pproximately 12 hours after Dovato for the duration of the St. John's wort co-administrati on (a separate formulation of dolutegravir is available for this dose adjustment, see section 4.2) . Oral contraceptives Ethinyl estradiol (EE) and Norgestromin (LH), Follicle Stimulating Hormone (FSH) and progesterone. No dose adjustment of oral contraceptives is necessary when co-administered with Dovato. Paediatric population Interaction studies have only been performed in adults. 4.6 Fertility, pregnancy and lactation Women of childbearing potential Women of childbearing potential (WOCBP) should be counselled about the potential risk of neural tube defects with dolutegravir ( a component of Dovato, see below), including consideration of effective contraceptive measures. If a woman plans pregnancy, the benefits and the risks of continuing treatment with Dovato should be discussed with the patient. Pregnancy The safety and eff icacy of a dual regimen has not been studied in pregnancy . 13 Human experience from a birth outcome surveillance study in Botswana shows a small increase of neural tube defects; 7 cases in 3,591 deliveries to mothers taking dolut egravir - containing regimens at the time of conception compared to 21 cases in 19,361 deliveries (0.11%: 95% CI 0.07%, 0.17%) to women exposed to non- dolutegravir regimens at the time of conception. The incidence of neural tube defects in the general popul ation ranges from 0.5- 1 case per 1,000 live births (0.05- 0.1%). Most neural tube defects occur within the first 4 weeks of embryonic development after conception (approximately 6 weeks after the last menstrual period). If a pregnancy is confirmed in the fi rst trimester while on Dovato, the benefits and risks of continuing Dovato versus switching to another antiretroviral regimen should be discussed with the patient taking the gestational age and the critical time period of neural tube defect development int o account. Data analysed from the Antiretroviral Pregnancy Registry do not indicate an increased risk of major birth defects in over 600 women exposed to dolutegravir during pregnancy but are currently insufficient to address the risk of neural tube defec ts. In animal reproductive toxicology studies with dolutegravir, no adverse development outcomes, including neural tube defects, were identified (see section 5.3). More than 1000 outcomes from exposure to dolutegravir during second and third trimester pregnancy indicate no evidence of increased risk of foet al/neonatal toxicity . Dovato may be used during the second and third trimester of pregnancy when the expected benefit justifies the potential risk to the foetus. Dolutegravir crosses the placenta in humans. In pregnant women living with HIV , the median foetal umbilical cord concentration of dolutegravir w as approximately 1. 3-fold greater compared with the maternal peripheral plasma concentration. There is insufficient information on the e ffects of dolutegravir on neonates. A large amount of data on the use of lami vudine in pregnant women (more than 52 00 outcomes from first trimester) indicates no malformative toxicity. Animal studies showed lamivudine may inhibit cellular DNA replication (see section 5.3). The clinical relevance of these findings is unknown. Mitochondrial dysfunction Nucleoside and nucleotide analogues have been demonstrated in vitro and in vivo to cause a variable degree of mitochondrial damage. There have been reports of mitochondrial dysfunction in HIV -negative infants exposed in utero and/or post -natally to nucleoside (see section 4.4). Breast -feeding Dolutegr avir is excreted in human milk in small amounts (a median dolutegravir breast milk to maternal plasma ratio of 0.033 has been shown) . There is insufficient information on the effects of dolutegravir in neonates/infants . Based on more than 200 mother/child pairs treated for HIV, serum concentrations of lamivudine in breastfed infants of m others treated for HIV are very low (< 4% of maternal serum concentrations) and progressively decrease to undetectable levels when breastfed infants reach 24 weeks of age. There are no data available on the safety of lamivudine when administered to babies less than three months old. It is recommended that women living with HIV do not breast -feed their infants in order to avoid transmission of HIV . Fertility 14 There are no data on the effects of d olutegravir or lamivudine on human ma le or female fertility. Animal studies indicate no effects of dolutegravir or lamivudine on male or female fertility (see section 5.3) . 4.7 Effects on ability to drive and use machines Dovato has no or negligible influence on the ability to drive and use machines. Patients should be informed that dizziness and somnolence has been reported during treatment with dolutegravir. The clinical status of the patient and the adverse reaction profile of Dovato should be borne in mind when considering the patient's ability to drive or operate machinery. 4.8 Undesirable effects Summary of the safety profile The most frequently reported adverse reactions a re headache ( 3%), The most severe adverse reaction reported with dolutegravir was a hypersensitivity reaction that included rash and severe liver effects ( see section 4.4). Tabulated list of adverse reactions The adverse reactions from clinical study and post -marketing experience are listed in Table 2 by body system, organ class and absolute frequency. Frequencies are defined as very common ( 1/10), common (1/100 to <1/1,000), very rare (<1/10,000), not known (cannot be estimated from the available data). Table 2 : Tabulated summary of adverse reactions to Dovato based on clinical study and post - marketing experience with Dovato and its individual components Frequency Adverse reaction Blood and lymphatic systems disorders: Uncommon: neutropenia, anaemia, disorders: Uncommon: hypersensitivity (see section 4.4), immune reconstitution syndrome (see section 4.4) Metabolism and nutrition disorders: Very rare: lactic acidosis Psychiatric disorders: Common: depression, anxiety, insomnia, abnormal dreams Uncommon : suicidal ideation *, suicide attempt*, panic attack *particularly in patients with a pre -existing history of depression or psychiatric illness. Rare: completed suicide* *particularly in patients with a pre -existing history of depression or psychiatric illness. 15 Nervous system disorders: Very common: headache Common: dizziness, somnolence : acute Rare: amylase elevations 1 This adverse reaction was identified through post -marketing surveillance for dolutegravir in combination with other ARVs. The frequency category of rare was estimated based on post -marketing reports. 2 In combination with increased transaminases. Description of selected adverse reactions Changes in laboratory biochemistries Dolutegravir has been associated with an increase in serum creatinine occuring in the first week of treatment when administered with other antiretroviral medicinal products. Increases in serum creatinine occurred within the first four week s of treatment with dolutegravir plus lamivudine and remained stable through 48 weeks. In the pooled GEMINI stud ies a mean change from baseline of 10.3 \u00b5mol/L (range: -36.3 \u00b5 mol/L to 55.7 \u00b5mol/L) was observed after 48 weeks of treatment. These changes are linked to the inhibiting effect of dolutegravir on renal tubular transporters of creatinine . The changes are not considered to be clinically relevant and do not reflect a change in glomerular filtration rate. Co-infec tion with Hepatitis B or C In the Phase III studies for the dolutegravir single agent, patients with hepatitis B and/or C co- infection were permitted to enrol provided that baseline liver chemistry tests did not exceed 5 times the upper limit of 16 normal (UL N). Overall, the safety profile in patients co -infected with hepatitis B and/or C was similar to that observed in patients without hepatitis B or C co- infection, although the rates of AST and ALT abnormalities were higher in the subgroup with hepatitis B a nd/or C co -infection for all treatment groups. Liver chemistry elevations consistent with immune reconstitution syndrome were observed in some subjects with hepatitis B and/or C co- infection at the start of dolutegravir therapy, particularly in those whose anti-hepatitis B therapy was withdrawn (see section 4.4). Metabolic parameters Weight and levels of blood lipids and glucose may increase during antiretroviral therapy (see section 4.4) . Osteonecrosis Cases of osteonecrosis have been reported, particu larly in patients with generally acknowledged risk factors, advanced HIV disease or long- term exposure to CART. The frequency of this is unknown (see section 4.4). Immune response syndrome In HIV -infected patients with severe immune deficiency at the time of initiation of combination antiretroviral therapy (CART), an inflammatory reaction to asymptomatic or residual opportunistic infections may arise. Autoimmune disorders (such as Graves' disease and autoimmune hepatitis ) have also been reported; however, the reported time to onset is more variable and these events can occur many months after initiation of treatment (see section 4.4). Paediatric population There are no clinical study data on the effects of Dovato in the paediatric population. Individual components have been investigated in adolescents (12 to 17 years). Based on limited available data with the dolutegravir single entity or lamivudine single entity used in combination with other antiretroviral agents to treat adolescents (12 to 17 years ), there were no additional types of adverse reactions beyond those observed in the adult population. Reporting of suspected adverse reactions Reporting suspected adverse reactions after authorisation of the medicinal product is important. It allows continued monitoring of the benefit/risk balance of the medicinal product. Healthcare professionals are asked to report any suspected adverse reactions via the national reporting system listed in Appendix V . 4.9 Overdose No specific symptoms or signs have been identified following acute overdose with dolutegravir or lamivudine, apart from those listed as adverse reactions. There is no specific treatment for an overdose of Dovato . If overdose occurs, the patient should be treated supportively with appropriate monitoring, as necessary. Since lamivudine is dialysable, continuous haemodialysis could be used in the treatment of overdose, although this has not been studied. As dolutegravir is highly bound to plasma proteins, it is unlikely that it will be significantly removed by dialysis. 5. PHARMACOLOGICAL PROPERTIES 5.1 Pharmacodynamic properties Pharmacotherapeutic group: Antivirals for systemic use, antivirals for treatment of HIV infections, combinations. ATC code: J05AR25 Mechanism of action 17 Dolutegravir inhibits HIV integrase by binding to the integrase active site and blocking the strand transfer step of retroviral Deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) integration which is essential for the HIV replication cycle. Lamivudine , via its active metabolite 5' -triphosphates (TP) (an for cytidine), inhibit s reverse transcriptase of HIV -1 and HIV -2 through incorporation of the monophosphate form into the viral DNA chain, resulting in chain termi nation. L amivudine triphosphate show s significantly less affinity for host cell DNA polymerases. Pharmacodynamic effects Antiviral a ctivity in cell culture Dolutegravir and lamivudine have been shown to inhibit replication of lab- strains and clinical is olates of HIV in a number of cell types, including transformed T cell lines, monocyte/macrophage derived lines and primary cultures of activated peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PMBCs) and monocyte/macrophages. The concentration of active substance necessary to effect viral replication by 50% (IC 50 - half maximal inhibitory concentration) varied according to virus and host cell type. The IC 50 for dolutegravir in various lab- strains using PBMC was 0.5 nM, and when using MT -4 cells it ranged from 0.7- 2 nM. Similar IC 50s were seen for clinical isolates without any major difference between subtypes; in a panel of 24 HIV -1 isolates of clades A, B, C, D, E, F and G and group O the mean IC 50 value was 0.2 nM (range 0.02- 2.14). The mean IC 50 for 3 HIV -2 isolates was 0.18 nM (range 0.09- 0.61). The median or mean IC 50 values for lamivudine against lab- strains of HIV -1 ranged from 0.007 to 2.3 \u00b5 M. The mean IC 50 against lab -strains of HIV -2 (LAV2 and EHO) ranged from 0.16 to 0.51 \u00b5M for lamivudine. The IC 50 values of lamivudine against HIV -1 subtypes (A -G) ranged from 0.001 to 0.170 against Group O from 0.030 to 0.160 \u00b5 M and against HIV -2 isolates from 0.002 to 0.120 \u00b5 M in peripheral blood CRF02_AG, n=12; and Subtype C or CRF_AC, n=13) from 37 untreated patients in Africa and Asia were susceptible to lamivudine ( IC 50 fold changes < 3.0 ). Group O isolates from antiviral na\u00efve patients tested for lamivudine activity were highly sensitiv e. Effect of human serum In 100% human serum, the mean fold shift for dolutegravir activity was 75 fold, resulting in protein adjusted IC 90 of 0.064 \u00b5g/mL. Lamivudine exhibits linear pharmacokinetics over the therapeutic dose range and displays low plasma protein binding (less than 36%). Resistance Dovato is indicated in the absence of documented or suspected resistance to the integrase inhibitor class and to lamivudine (see section 4.1). For information around in vitro resistance, and cross resis tance to other agents of the integrase- and NRTI class, please refer to the SmPCs of dolutegravir and lamivudine. None of the twelve subjects in the dolutegravir plus lamivudine group or the nine subjects in the dolutegravir plus tenofovir disoproxil /emtricitabine FDC group that met virological criteria Week 144 across the GEMINI -1 (204861) and GEMINI -2 (205543) studies had treatment emergent integrase inhibitor or NRTI class resistance. In previously untreated patients receiving dolutegravir + 2 NRTIs in Phase IIb and Phase III, no development of resistance to the integrase inhibitor class, or to the NRTI class was seen (n=1118 follow -up of 48-96 weeks). Effects on e lectrocardiogram 18 No relevant effects were seen with dolutegravir on the QTc interval, with doses exceeding the clinical dose by approximately three fold. A s imilar stud y was not conducted with lamivudine. Clinical efficacy and safety Antiretroviral na\u00efve subjects The efficacy of Dovato is supported by data from 2 identical 148-week, Phase III, randomised, double -blind, multicentr A HIV -1 infected antiretrovira l treatment -na\u00efve adult subjects received treatment in the trials. Subjects were enrolled with a screening plasma HIV -1 RNA of 1000 c/mL to 500,000 c/mL. Subjects were randomised to a two- drug regimen of dolutegravir 50 mg plus lamivudine 300 mg once dail y or dolutegravir 50 mg plus tenofovir disoproxil /emtricitabine 245/200 mg once daily. The primary efficacy endpoint for each GEMINI trial was the proportion of subjects with plasma HIV -1 RNA <50 copies/mL at Week 48 (Snapshot algorithm for the ITT -E popul ation). Double blind therapy continue d up to week 96, followed by open label therapy up to week 148. At baseline, in the pooled analysis, the median age of subjects was 33 years, 15% were female, 6 9% were white, 9% were CDC Stage 3 (AIDS), 20% had HIV -1 RNA >100,000 copies/mL, and 8% had CD4+ cell count less than 200 cells per mm3; these characteristics were similar between studies and treatment arms. In the primary week 48 analysis, dolutegravir plus lamivudine was non- inferior to and GEMINI -2 studies . This was supported by the pooled analysis, see Table 3. 19 Table 3 Virologic Outcomes of Randomised Treatment of GEMINI at Week 48 (Snapshot algorithm) GEMINI -1 and Virologic non response 3% Reasons Data in window and 50 copies/mL 1% <1% Discontinued for lack of efficacy <1% <1% Discontinued for other reasons and 50 copies/mL <1% <1% Change in ART <1% <1% No virologic data at Week 48 window 6% 5% Reasons Discontinued study due to adverse event or death 1% 2% Discontinued study for other reasons 4% 3% Missing data during window but on study <1% HIV -1 RNA <50 copies/mL by baseline n/N (%) Baseline Plasma Viral Load (copies/mL) 100,000 >100,000 526 / 576 (91%) 129 / 140 (92%) 531 153 (cells/ mm3) 50 / 63 / >200 605 / -1 subtype B 424 / 467 (91%) 452 / 488 (93%) A 84 / 86 (98%) 74 / 78 (95%) Other 147 / 163 (90%) 143 / 151 (95%) Gender Male 555 / 603 (92%) 580 / 619 (94%) Female 100 / 113 (88%) 89 / 98 (91%) Race White 451 / 484 (93%) 473 / 499 African -America Heritage/Other 204 / 232 (88%) 196 / 218 (90%) * The results of the pooled analysis are in line with those of the individual studies, for which the primary endpoint (difference in proportion <50 copies/mL plasma HIV -1 RNA at Week 48 based on the Snapshot algorithm for dolutegravir plus lamivudine versus dolutegravir plus tenofovir disoproxil /emtricitabine FDC) met. adjusted difference was 2.6 (95% CI: - 6.7; 1.5) for GEMINI -1 (95% CI: - 4.3; 2.9) for GEMINI -2 with a n on-inferiority margin of 10%.

Pooled analysis also stratified by study. Assessed using a non -inferiority margin of 10%. N = Number of subjects in each treatment group The mean increase in CD4+ T -cell counts through week 144 was 302 cells/mm3 in the dolutegravir plus lamivudine arm and 300 cells/mm3 in the dolutegravir plus tenofovir/emtricitabine arm. Virologically suppressed subjects The efficacy of dolutegravir/lamivudine in virologically suppressed subjects is supported by data from a randomised, open- label, trial (TANGO [204862]). A total of 741 adul t HIV -1 infected subjects, without any evidence of resistance to the NRTI or integrase inhibitor (INSTI) class and who were on a stable suppressive tenofovir alafenamide based regimen (TBR) received treatment in the studies. Subjects were randomised in a 1:1 ratio to receive dolutegravir/lamivudine FDC or continue with TBR for up to 200 weeks . Randomisation was stratified by baseline core agent primary eff icacy endpoint was the proportion of subjects with plasma HIV-1 RNA 50 c/mL (virologic non- response) as per the FDA Snapshot category at Week 48 ( adjusted for randomisation stratification factor) . At baseline the median age of subjects was 39 years, 8% w ere female and 21% non- white, 5% were CDC Class C (AIDS) and 98% subjects had Baseline CD4+ cell count 200 cells/mm 3; these characteristics were similar between treatment arms. Subjects had been on ART for a median of around 3 years prior to Day 1 Around 80% were on INSTI -based TBR (mainly elvitegravir/c) at baseline. In the primary 48 week analysis , dolutegravir/lamivudine was non -inferior to TBR, with <1% of subjects in both arms experiencing virologic failure (HIV -1 RNA 50 c/mL) (Table 5 ). 21 Table 5 Virologic Outcomes of Randomised Treatment of TANGO at Week 48 (95% confidence intervals) -0.3 (-1.2, 0.7) Reasons for virologic non response: Data in window and 50 copies/mL 0% 0% Discontinued for lack of efficacy 0% <1% Discontinued for other reasons and 50 copies/mL <1% 0% Change in ART 0% 0% No virologic data at Week 48 window 7% 6% Reasons Discontinued study due to adverse event or death 3% <1% Discontinued study for other reasons 3% 6% Missing data during window but on study 0% <1% *Based on an 8% non -inferiority margin, DTG/3TC is non -inferior to TBR at Week 48 in the secondary analysis (proportion of subjects achieving <50 copies/mL plasma HIV -1 RNA) . **Based inferiority margin, DTG/3TC is non -inferior to TBR at Week 48 in the primary analysis (proportion of subjects with plasma HIV -1 RNA 50 c/mL) . Based on CMH -stratified analysis adjusting for Baseline third agent class (PI, NNRTI, INSTI). N = Number of subjects in each treatment gr oup; TBR = tenofovir alafenamide based regimen . Treatment outcomes between treatment arms at week 48 were similar across the stratification factor, baseline third agent class and across subgroups by age, sex, race, baseline CD4+ cell count, CDC HIV dise ase stage, and countries. The median change from baseline in CD4+ count at Week 48 was 22.5 cells per mm3 in subjects who switched to dolutegravir/lamivudine and 11.0 cells per mm3 in subjects who stayed on TBR. At 96 weeks in the TANGO study, the propor tion of subjects with HIV -1 RNA 50 c/mL (Snapshot) was 0.3% and 1.1% in the dolutegravir/lamivudine and TBR groups , respectively. Based on a non- inferiority margin of 4%, dolutegravir/lamivudine remained non- inferior to TBR, as the upper bound of the 95% CI for the adjusted treatment difference ( -2.0% ; 0.4%) was less than 4% for the ITT E Population. The me dian change from baseline in CD4+ T -cell counts at week 96 was 61 cells/mm 3 in the dolutegravir/lamivudine arm and 45 cells/mm3 in the TBR arm . At 144 weeks, the proportion of subjects with HIV- 1 RNA 50 c/mL (Snapshot) was 0.3% and 1.3% in the dolutegravir/lamivudine and TBR groups , respectively. Based on a non- inferiority margin of 4%, dolutegravir/lamivudine remained non- inferior to TBR, as the upper bound of the 95% CI for the adjusted treatment difference ( -2.4%, 0.2%) was less than 4% for the ITT E Population. The me dian change from baseline in CD4+ T -cell counts at Week 144 was 36 cells/mm3 in the dolute gravir/lamivudine arm and 35 cells/mm3 in the TBR arm. Paediatric population The efficacy of Dovato , or the dual combination of dolutegravir plus lamivudine (as single entities ) has not been studied in children or adolescents . The European Medicines Agency has deferred the obligation to submit the results of studies with Dovato in one or more subsets of the paediatric population in the treatment of HIV infection. 5.2 Pharmacokinetic properties 22 When administered in fasted state, bioequivalence regarding C max was achieved for dolutegravir, when comparing Dovato to dolutegravir 50 mg co- administered with lamivudine 300 mg. Dolutegravir AUC 0-t was 16% higher for than for dolutegravir 50 mg co -administered with lamivudine 300 mg. This increase is not considered clinically relevant. When administered in fast ed state, bioequivalence was achieved for lamivudine AUC , when comparing Dovato to lamivudine 300 mg co- administered with dolutegravir 50 mg. Lamivudine C max for Dovato was 32% higher than lamivudine 300 mg co- administered with dolutegravir 50 mg. The higher lamivudine C max, is not considered clinically relevant . Absorption Dolutegravir and lamivudine are rapidly absorbed following oral administration. The absolute bioavailability of dolutegravir has not been established. The absolute bioavailability of oral lamivudine in adults is approximately 80- 85%. For Dovato, the me dian time to maximal plasma concentration (t max) is 2.5 hours for dolutegravir and 1.0 hour for lamivudine, when dosed under fasted conditions . Exposure to dolutegravir was generally similar between healthy subjects and HIV -1-infected subjects. In HIV-1-infected adult subjects following dolutegravir 50 mg once daily, the steady -state pharmacokinetic parameters (geometric mean [%CV]) based on population s were AUC (0-24) 53.6 (27) \u00b5g.h/mL, C max = 3.67 (20) \u00b5g/mL, and C min = 1.11 (46) \u00b5g/mL. Following multiple - dose oral administration of lamivudine 300 mg once daily for seven days, the mean (CV) steady- state C max is 2.04 \u00b5g/m \u00b5g.h/m L (21%). Administration of a single Dovato tablet with a high fat meal increased dolutegravir AUC (0-) and C max by 33% and 21%, respectively, and decreased the lamivudine Cmax by 30% compared to fasted conditions. The lamivudine AUC (0-) was not affected by a high fat meal. These changes are not clinically significant. Dovato may be administered with or without food. Distribution The apparent volume of distribution of dolute gravir (Vd/F) is 17-20 L. Intravenous studies with lamivudine showed that the mean appa rent volume of distribution is 1.3 L /kg. Dolutegravir is highly bound (> 99%) to human plasma proteins based on in vitro data. Binding of dolutegravir to plasma proteins is independent of dolutegravir concentration. Total blood and plasma drug- related radioactivity concentration ratios averaged b etween 0.441 to 0.535, indicating minimal association of radioactivity with blood cellular components. The unbound fraction of dolutegravir in plasma is increased at low levels of serum albumin (<35 g/L) as seen in subjects with moderate hepatic impairment . Lamivudine exhibits linear pharmacokinetics over the therapeutic dose range and displays limited plasma protein binding in vitro (< 16% - 36% to serum albumin ). Dolutegravir and lamivudine present cerebrospinal fluid (CSF). In 13 treatment -na\u00efve s ubjects on a stable dolutegravir plus abacavir/lamivudine regimen, dolutegravir concentration in CSF averaged 18 ng/mL (comparable to unbound plasma concentration, and above the IC 50). The mean ratio of CSF/serum lamivudine concentrations 2 -4 hours after oral administration was approximately 12%. The true extent of CNS penetration of lamivudine and its relationship with any clinical efficacy is unknown. Dolutegravir is present in the female and male genital tract. AUC in cervicovaginal fluid, cervical tiss ue and vaginal tissue were 6 -10% of those in corresponding plasma at steady state. AUC in semen was 7% and 17% in rectal tissue of those in corresponding plasma at steady state. Biotransformation Dolutegravir is primarily metabolized via UGT1A1 with a minor CYP3A component (9.7% of total dose administered in a human mass balance study). Dolutegravir is the predominant circulating compound in 23 plasma; renal elimination of unchanged active substance i s low (< 1% of the dose). Fifty -three percent of total oral dose is excreted unchanged in the faeces. It is unknown if all or part of this is due to unabsorbed active substance or biliary excretion of the glucuronidate conjugate, which can be further degra ded to form the parent compound in the gut lumen. Thirty- two percent of the total oral dose is excreted in the urine, represented by ether glucuronide of dolutegravir (18.9% of total dose), N -dealkylation (3.6% of total dose), and a metabolite f ormed by oxidation at the benzylic carbon (3.0% of total dose). Metabolism of lamivudine is a minor route of elimination. Lamivudine is predominately cleared by renal excretion of unchanged lamivudine. The likelihood of metabolic drug interactions with la mivudine is low due to the small extent of hepatic metabolism (5 -10%). Drug interactions In vitro , dolutegravir demonstrated no direct, or weak inhibition (IC did not induce CYP1A2, CYP2B6 or CYP3A4. Based on this data, dolutegravir is not expected to affect the pharmacokinetics of medicinal products that are substrates of major enzy mes or transporters (see section 4.5). In vitro , dolutegravir was not a substrate of human OATP 1B1, OATP 1B3 or OCT 1. In vitro, lamivudine did not inhibit or induce CYP enzymes (such as CYP3A4, CYP2C9 or CYP2D6) and demonstrate no is therefore not expected to affect the plasma concentrations of medicinal products that are substrates of these enzymes or transporters. Lamivudine was not significantly metabolised by CYP enzymes. Elimination Dolutegravir has a terminal half -life of ~14 hours. The apparent oral clearance (CL/F) is approximately 1 L/hr in HIV -infected patients based on a population pharmacokinetic analysis. The observed lamivudine half -life of elimination is 18 to 19 hours. For patients receiving lamivudine 300 mg once daily, the terminal intracellular half -life of lamivudine -TP w as 16 to 19 hours. The mean systemic clearance of lamivudine is approximately 0.32 L/h/kg, predominantly by renal clearance (> 70%) via the organic cationic transport system. Studies in patients with renal impairment show lamivudine elimination is affected by renal dysfunction. Dose reduction is required for patients with creatinine clearance < 30 mL/min (see section 4.2). Pharmacokinetic/p harmacodynamic relationship(s) In a randomized, treated with dolutegravir monotherapy (ING111521) demonstrated rapid and dose- dependent antiviral activity, with mean decline in HIV -1 RNA of 2.5 log 10 at day 11 for 50 mg dose . This antiviral response w as maintained for 3 to 4 days after the last dose in the 50 mg group. Special patient populations Children The pharmacokinetics of dolutegravir in 10 antiretroviral treatment -experienced HIV -1 infected adolescents (12 to 17 years) showed that dolutegravir 50 mg once daily dosage resulted in dolutegravir exposure comparable to that observed in adults who received dolutegravir 50 mg once daily. 24 Limited data are available in adolescents receiving a daily dose of 300 mg of lamivudine. Pharmacokinetic parameters are comparable to those reported in adults. Elderly Population pharmacokinetic analysis of dolutegravir using data in HIV -1 infected adults showed that there was no clinically relevant effect of age on dolutegravir exposure. Pharmacokinetic data for dolutegravir and lamivudine in subjects >65 years of age are limited. Renal impairment Pharmacokinetic data have been obtained for dolutegravir and lamivudine separately. Renal clearance of unchanged active substance is a minor pat hway of elimination for dolutegravir. A study of the pharmacokinetics of dolutegravir was performed in subjects with severe renal impairment (CLcr <30 mL/min). No clinically important pharmacokinetic differences between subjects with severe renal impairmen t (CLcr <30 mL/min) and matching healthy subjects were observed. Dolutegravir has not been studied in patients on dialysis, though differences in exposure are not expected. Studies with lamivudine show that plasma concentrations (AUC) are increased in pat ients with renal dysfunction due to decreased clearance. Based on the lamivudine data, Dovato is not recommended for patients with creatinine clearance of < 30 m L/min. Hepatic impairment Pharmacokinetic data has been obtained for dolutegravir and lamivudine separately. Dolutegravir is primarily metabolized and eliminated by the liver. A single dose of 50 mg of dolutegravir was administered to 8 subjects with moderate hepatic impairment (Child -Pugh class B) and to 8 matched health y adult controls. While the total dolutegravir concentration in plasma was similar, a 1.5 to 2 fold increase in unbound exposure to dolutegravir was observed in subjects with moderate hepatic impairment compared to healthy controls. No dosage adjustment is considered necessary for patients with mild to moderate hepatic impairment. The effect of severe hepatic impairment on the pharmacokinetics of dolutegravir has not been studied. Data obtained in patients with moderate to severe hepatic impairment show th at lamivudine pharmacokinetics are not significantly affected by hepatic dysfunction. Polymorphisms in drug metabolising enzymes There is no evidence that common polymorphisms in drug metabolising enzymes alter dolutegravir pharmacokinetics to a clinicall y meaningful extent. In a meta -analysis using pharmacogenomics samples collected in clinical studies in healthy subjects, subjects with UGT1A1 (n=7) genotypes conferring poor dolutegravir metabolism had a 32% lower clearance of dolutegravir and 46% higher AUC compared with subjects with genotypes associated with normal metabolism via UGT1A1 (n=41). Gender Population PK analyses using pooled pharmacokinetic data from clinical studies where dolutegravir or lamivudine was administered to adults in combination with other ARVs revealed no clinically relevant effect of gender on the exposure of dolutegravir or lamivudine . There is no evidence that a dose adjustment of dolutegravir or lamivudine would be required based on the e ffects of gender on PK parameters. Race Population PK analyses using pooled pharmacokinetic data from clinical studies where dolutegravir was administered to adults in combination with other ARVs revealed no clinically relevant effect of race on the exposure of dolutegravir. The pharmacokinetics of dolutegravir following single dose oral administration to Japanese subjects appear similar to observed parameters in Western (US) subjects. There is no evidence that 25 a dose adjustment of dolutegravir or lamivud ine would be required based on the effects of race on PK parameters . Co-infection with Hepatitis B or C Population pharmacokinetic analysis indicated that hepatitis C virus co- infection had no clinically relevant effect on the exposure to dolutegravir. There are limited pharmacokinetic data on subjects with hepatitis B co-infection (see section 4.4). 5.3 Preclinical safety data There are no data available on the effects of the combination of dolutegravir and lamivudine in animals. Carcinogenesis and mutagenesis Dolutegravir was not mutagenic or clas togenic using in vitro tests in bacteria and cultured mammalian cells, and an in viv o rodent micronucleus assay. Lamivudine w as not mutagenic in bacterial tests, but consistent with other nucleoside analogues , inhibit s cellular DNA replication in in vitro mammalian tests such as the mouse lymphoma assay. The results from two in vivo rat micronucleus tests with lamivudine were negative . Lamivudine has not shown any genotoxic activity in the in vivo studies. The carcinogenic potential of a combination of dolutegravir and lamivudine has not been tested. Dolutegravir was not carcinogenic in long term studies in the mouse and rat. In long- term oral carcinogenicity studies in rats and mice, lamivudine did not show any carcinogenic potential. Reproductive toxicology studies In reproductive toxicity studies in animals, dolutegravir and lamivudine were shown to cross the placenta. Oral administratio n of dolutegravir to pregnant rats at doses up to 1000 mg/kg daily from days 6 to 17 of gestation did not elicit maternal toxicity, developmental toxicity or teratogenicity ( 37.2 times the 50 mg human clinical exposure, based on AUC following single dose in the fasted state ). Oral administration of dolutegravir to pregnant rabbits at doses up to 1000 mg/kg daily from days 6 to 18 of gestation did not elicit developmental toxicity or teratogenicity ( 0.55 times the 50 mg human clinical exposure , based on AUC following single dose in the fasted state ). In rabbits, maternal toxicity (decreased food consumption, scant/no faeces/urine, suppressed body weight gain) was observed at 1000 mg/kg ( 0.55 times the 50 mg human clinical exposure , based on AUC following single dose in the fasted state ). Lamivudine was not teratogenic in animal studies but there were indications of an increase in early embryonic deaths in rabbits at relatively low systemic exposures, comparable to those achieved in hum ans. A similar effect was not seen in rats even at very high systemic exposure. Fertility studies in rats have shown that dolutegravir or lamivudine have no effect on male or female fertility. Repeated dose toxicity The effect of prolonged daily treatment with high doses of dolutegravir has been evaluated in repeat oral dose toxicity studies in rats (up to 26 weeks) and in monkeys (up to 38 weeks). The primary effect of dolutegravir was gastrointestinal intolerance or irritation in rats and monkey s at doses that produce systemic exposures approximately 28.5 and 1. 1 times the 50 mg human clinical exposure following single dose in the fasted state based on AUC, respectively. Because gastrointestinal (GI) intolerance is considered to be due to local a ctive substance administration, mg/kg or mg/m 2 metrics are appropriate determinates of safety cover for this toxicity. GI intolerance in monkeys occurred at 30 times the human mg/kg equivalent dose (based on 50 kg human), and 11 times the human mg/m2 equivalent dose for a total daily clinical dose of 50 mg. 6.

Symptoms of infection and inflammation People with advanced HIV infection or AIDS have weak immune systems, and are more likely to develop serious infections (opportunistic infections). Such infections may have been \"silent\" and not detected by the weak immune system before treatment was started. After starting treatment, the immune system becomes 54 stronger, and may attack the infections, which can cause symptom s of infection or inflammation. Symptoms usually include fever, plus some of the following: headache stomach ache difficulty breathing. In rare cases, as the immune system becomes stronger, it can also attack healthy body tissue ( autoimmune disorders). The symptoms of autoimmune disorders may develop many months after you start taking medicine to treat your HIV infection. Symptoms may include: palpitations (rapid or irregular heartbeat) or tremor hyperactivity (excessive restlessness and move ment) weakness beginning in the hands and feet and moving up towards the trunk of the body. If you get any symptoms of infection or if you notice any of the symptoms above : Tell your doctor immediately. Don't take other medicines for the infection without your doctor's advice. Joint pain, stiffness and bone problems Some people taking combination therapy for HIV develop a condition called osteonecrosis. With this condition, parts of the bone tissue are permanently damaged because of reduced blood supply to the bone. People may be more likely to get this condition: if they have been taking combination therapy for a long time if they are also taking anti -inflammatory medicines called corticosteroids if they drink alcohol if their immune systems are very weak if they are overweight. Signs of osteonecrosis include: stiffness in the joints aches and pains in the joints (especially in the hip, knee or shoulder) difficulty moving. If you notice any of these symptoms: Tell your doctor. Weight, blood lipid and blood glucose effects: During HIV therapy there may be an increase in weight and in levels of blood lipids and glucose.
