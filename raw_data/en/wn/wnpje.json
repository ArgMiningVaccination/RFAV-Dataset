Includes a a great herbal supplement too!", "sitename": "Live Well Zone", "date": "2020-12-03", "cleaned_text": "When it comes to herbs that balance hormones, there is an overwhelming number to choose from. As a result, we often feel overwhelmed when we try to make sense of the options that are on the market (which is why it's always a good idea to work with an herbalist or naturopathic doctor for a customized plan). But you can start to overcome this overwhelm when you understand some of the types or categories of herbs that have traditionally been used to support hormone balance. These categories are: - Nervous system herbs: this system manages all communication throughout the body. And a lot of that communication relies on hormones. So, whether it's communication about sleep, your menstrual cycle or your body temperature, the nervous system needs to be in good health for everything to run smoothly. - Herbs for the digestive system (particularly, the liver): this organ does a lot of heavy lifting to keep our hormones and entire body in check. This includes storing vitamins and minerals, removing toxins from the blood, metabolizing estrogen, converting thyroid T4 hormone to T3 and so much more. - Herbs for the reproductive system: this system is part of the HPG axis, which involve the hypothalamus, pituitary and gonads (i.e. the ovaries, for women). The HPG regulates secretion of sex hormones like estrogen and progesterone. As you can see, if one of these three systems isn't working optimally, it can be harder to balance your hormones and/or getting last results. So, in this article, we're going to look at six herbs that address all of those systems, plus an all-in-one supplement that you can use to quickly incorporate these herbs into your routine. Note: this post contains some affiliate links and I may earn a commission if you use them. 6 HERBS FOR NATURAL HORMONE BALANCE The herbs we're going to look at are: - St. John's Wort and Wild Oats: for the nervous system. - Red clover and dandelion: for the liver and blood purification. - Vitex and black cohosh: for the reproductive system. Let's dive into each one! 1. St. John's Wort This bright herb has traditionally been used as a tonic for the nervous system. Not only can St. John's Wort alleviate mild to moderate depression, but it also relieves physical tension and eases anxiety. In fact, this herb has been shown to be very helpful when \"menopausal changes trigger irritability and anxiety\" ( [source](https://theherbalacademy.com/st-johns-wort-not-just-depression/)). Furthermore, St. John's Wort is effective at reducing spasms in various parts of the body. It's no surprise then that this may help to ease menstrual cramps and other PMS symptoms ( [source](https://www.mountsinai.org/health-library/herb/st-johns-wort)). Last but not least, St John's Wort is also good for the liver which is a nice perk for hormone health. 2. Wild Oats (Avena Sativa) Even though we often think about oats in terms of oatmeal, the plant actually has a long history of medicinal use. Wild oats (sometimes called \"milky seed\") have historically been used to support the nervous system (which plays an integral part in hormone function), soothe frayed nerves and promote physical, mental, and emotional strength. Whether we're talking about exhaustion, depression or insomnia, oats benefit the [entire](https://theherbalacademy.com/oats-benefits-getting-to-know-avena-sativa/) body in various ways! 3. Red Clover Red clover has historically been used as a cleansing and purifying herb. It may help to protect the liver and it's also said to purify the blood ( [1](https://www.mountsinai.org/health-library/herb/red-clover), [2](https://www.jonbarron.org/herbal-library/herbs/red-clover), [3](http://www.zgggws.com/en/article/doi/10.11847/zgggws2013-29-08-31)) This is significant because clean blood means you no longer have to worry about hormone disruptors flowing through your body and causing more damage to other parts of your body. Aside from its cleansing abilities, red clover contains [isoflavones](https://draxe.com/nutrition/red-clover/) that act like natural estrogen. Now, you might be thinking \"should I be taking in more estrogen?\" Remember that even though excess estrogen can cause problems, too little estrogen can also be problematic. With red clover, your body will be able to find a happy medium that works for you. In addition to all of the above, red clover has also been shown to help with inflammatory skin conditions such as acne, psoriasis and more! 4. Dandelion According to herbalist James Green, \"including simple, wild, fresh and free herbs such as young springtime dandelion leaves in your diet helps everything work better\" ( [source](https://theherbalacademy.com/a-family-herb-dandelion/)). That's a lot of praise for something many of us consider to be a pesky weed! There are two main reasons why dandelion is great for the liver, and hormones: - First, it increases bile production. - Secondly, it supports emptying of the gallbladder. Both of the above functions contribute to healthy liver function and ultimately, to hormone imbalance. In addition, dandelion acts a diuretic, meaning it increases urine. Other than regular bowel movements, urine is one of the body's preferred - and safest - ways of eliminating toxins from the body. 5. Vitex (aka Chaste tree or chaste berry) Also known as chasteberry or chaste tree, these little berries have been shown to improve PMS, [irregular](https://draxe.com/health/irregular-periods/) (and absent) periods, infertility, menopause symptoms, fibroid and endometriosis. So, how can one plant do all this? It's all down to the fact that vitex acts on the hypothalamus and pituitary glands. As we saw earlier, the hypothalamus and pituitary send out signals that affect hormone production in various parts of the body. In addition, vitex is able to ( [source](https://draxe.com/nutrition/vitex/)): - Increase levels of luteinizing hormone. - Inhibit the release of FSH (follicle stimulating hormone). - regulate prolactin. These three things are important for maintaining a healthy balance of estrogen to progesterone. And this matters a lot because estrogen and progesterone are strongly intertwined. Any disturbance in the delicate balance between these two hormones could contribute to estrogen dominance and a laundry list of health complications. 6. Black Cohosh If you struggle with hot flashes, anxiety, PCOS, fibroids, or sleep disturbances, black cohosh is an herb that you should consider using ( [source](https://draxe.com/nutrition/black-cohosh/)). In fact, when it comes to improving PCOS symptoms, one [study](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25524718) showed that black cohosh is as effective as prescription drugs. Although it is not totally clear how black cohosh works, there's no denying the anecdotal and scientific reports of its benefits for women's health.
