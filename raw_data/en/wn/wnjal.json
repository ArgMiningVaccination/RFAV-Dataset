WKU has over 100 years experience in education primarily serving the south central counties in Kentucky and the northern border counties of Tennessee. The School of Nursing has produced advanced practice nurses since 1995 and is accredited by the Commission on Collegiate Nursing Education. The D NP program has received approval by the WKU Board of Rege nts, the Kentucky Board of Nursing , and is pending approval by the Kentucky Council on Post -Secondary Education in April of 2011. The practice doctorate degree , implemented as a recommendation from the nursing profession will produc e nurse leaders who can contribute to the chan ging health care environment by leading health care system change and providing advanced nursing care. The WKU DNP will provide entry at either the Post -MSN or BSN level and will be an ongoing degree program. The Post -MSN DNP program will admit an annual cohort of 20 students beginning in the fall of 201 1, continuing with an addition al 20 students each year. MSN students with advanced nursing practice degrees prepared as nurse practitioners, clinical nurse spe cialists, certified registered nurse anesthetist, and nurse midwives are eligible for admission to the Post -MSN DNP option. The Post -MSN option will also be available to those with an MSN in nursing administration. The first cohort of BSN to MSN students will enter the program in the fall of 2013 beginning with 12 students. It is anticipated that the BSN to DNP cohort will increase each year reaching by year three 20 BSN - DNP students annually. BSN to DNP students will graduate the program prepared to sit for national certification as Family Nurse Practitioners (FNP) . Based upon the needs assessment the program has the potential to have 118 students enrolled by the fall of 2016. It is anticipated that the first g roup of students (MSN -DNP) will graduate in the spring of 2014. The 36 -credit hour Post -MSN DNP and 76 -credit hour BSN to DNP will utilize blended course delivery methods. Potential applicants documented in t he completed nee ds assessment that they prefe rred limite d face -to-face meetings in week end options facilitated by online or interactive television sessions. The graduate faculty in the school of nursing has experience and technology support to provide educational experiences using these pedagogies. No new sites will be initiated. The program has sufficient financial, physical, technological, library, evaluation, faculty , and other resources to implement the proposed program. 3 II. BACKGROUND INFORMATION WKU's School of Nursing (S ON) has a strong presence in the community, the region , as well as surrounding states and a history of producing excellent nurses at all levels. We are the major supplier of nurses to the surrounding hospitals, health departments, clinics, primary care centers, sch ools, long -term care and rehabilitation facilities, and other agencies. Our record of preparing advanced practice nurses is evident in the graduates who have been successful in practice. The faculty believes that the proposed DNP program will best continue to prepare our graduates for advanced practice roles in the current complex health system that will require nurses prepared as leaders to change the health behaviors o f Kentuckians and the nation. Overview and General Information about WKU On March 21, 1906, the Kentucky General Assembly approved legislation to establish two teacher training institutions, or \"normal schools,\" in the state. A locating commission chose Bowling Green, KY to be the site of one, and the Western Kentucky State Nor mal School was created. Classes began on January 22, 1907. Over the next decade, the curriculum focused on teacher training and certification . In 1922 the state renamed the institution Western Kentucky State Normal School and Teachers College and author ized it to grant four -year degrees. The first such degrees were awarded in 1924. As Western's mission broadened; its name was shortened in 1948 to Western Kentucky State College. On June 16, 1966 Western Kentucky State College became Western Kentucky Un iversity. The College of Health and Human Services (CHHS) was established by the Board of Regents in August of 2002, consolidating all health and human services programs including the School of Nursing, Allied Health, Communication Disorders, Consumer Family Sciences, Kinesiology, Recreation and Sports, Public Health and Social Work. In the fall of 2010, only Potter College of Arts and Letters surpassed CHHS enrollment. The WKU Board of Regents and the Council on Post Secondary Education (CPE) ap proved a proposal for a Master of Science degree program in 1995. The program was approved to prepare Advanced Practice Nurses (APNs) as primary care practitioners, nurse educators, and nurse administrators. The primary care nurse practitioner concentrat ion was implemented in 4 fall 1995 with its first graduate completing the program in August 1997. The nurse educator tract was implemented in fall 2001. The first nursing administration course was taught in fall 2005, with the first cohort completing this c oncentration in May 2006. A post -masters certificate option in the nurse practitioner and nurse educator's concentrations was also implemented . WKU Mission, Vision , and Purpose Western Kentucky University (WKU) is part of the public Kentucky postsecondary education system established more than 100 years ago by Kentucky statute. WKU is governed by its Board of Regents and the CPE . A nationally prominent university, it engages a diverse global family of faculty and students in technologically enhanced academic programs in education, the liberal arts and sciences, business and health professions at the undergraduate and graduate levels . The WKU mission statement states Western Kentucky University prepares students to be productive, engaged, an d socially responsible citizen leaders of a global society. It provides research, service and lifelong learning oppo rtunities for its constituents. WKU is responsible for stewarding a high quality of life for those within its reach. WKU recognizes tha t its mission continues to evolve in response to regional, national, and global changes, and the need for lifelong learning. The program philosophy is based upon the beliefs of the faculty and is supported by the congruence between the mission of the Univ ersity, College , and School of Nursing. Table 1 presents in cross tabs a comparison of the mission statements. Table 1 Comparison of WKU Mission of University, College , and School of Nursing WKU Mission College of HHS Mission School of Nursing Mission Western Kentucky University prepares students to be productive, engaged, and socially responsible citizen leaders of a global society. It provides research, service and lifelong learning opportunities for its constituents. WKU is responsible for stewarding a high quality of life for those within its reach. The college provides diverse educational opportunities leading to excellence in health and human services for a global community. Our mission is to provide undergraduate and graduate education, and lifelong learning opportunities to meet the changing health care needs of a global society. 5 Statement of Purpose WKU provides students with rigorous academic programs in education, the liberal arts and sciences, business, and traditional and emerging professional programs, with emphasis at the baccalaureate level, complemented by relevant associate and graduate -level programs. Located in the Appendix A is a list of the programs and degrees currently offered by WKU. WKU 's commitment is to ensu re value in a holistic learning experience through high standards for student achievement and conduct, a strong faculty, technological innovation, personalized attention, broad access, and public accountability for actions and outcomes. In the spring of 2010, the university president updated the strategic guide to include funding priorities for the next five years. Listed in the priorities was increasing support for expansion of the School of Nursing to accommodate an increasing enrollment and create space to ensure the vitality of the program . In 200 8, the approval by the Kentucky Council of Postsecondary Education (CPE) for the EdD degree resulted in the further development of resources and support for a second practice doctorate, the DNP . Program Approvals The DNP program was approved by the WKU Board of Regents on January 21, 2011 and the Kentucky Board of Nursing on January 28, 2011 (see Appendix B). The proposal has been submitted to the CPE with approval exp ected in April 2011. III. ASSESS MENT OF NEED AND PROGRAM PLANNING/APPROVAL Research studies by the Institute of Medicine, the National Institute of Health (NIH) , and the Joint Commission on the Accreditation of Healthcare document the changing and complex health needs of Ame ricans, the rapid expansion of h ealth care knowledge, and the challenges of educating healthcare professionals. In 2004 , members of the American Association of Colleges of Nursing endorsed the Position Statement on the Practice Doctor in Nursing (DNP) , a call t o change the education of advanced practice nurses (APNs) by requiring a DNP as the entry level for practice for nurse practitioners, nurse anesthetists, clinical nurse specialists and nurse midwives by the year 2015. In 2006, the American Association of Colleges of Nurses (AACN) published the DNP Essentials to guide program and curriculum development. The DNP as a 6 practice -focused degree is analogous to professional degrees offered in other health professions (e.g. Doctor of Medicine, Doctor of Dental Su rgery, Doctor of Pharmacy, and Doctor of Physical Therapy). The National Academy of Sciences (AACN, 2006b ) supported the practice doctorate as the terminal degree for advanced practice nurses by stating, The NIH has identified that d octoral ly-prepared nurse s are required to fully implement new science and practice innovations developed by nurse investigators(AACN, 2006b ). The Commission on Collegiate Nursing Education (CCNE) accrediting body of the DNP programs in the spri ng of 2009. To date CCNE has accredited 56 programs. AACN reports that 138 nursing graduate programs are enrolling students in DNP program in 36 states and the District of Columbia (AACN, 2010 a). AACN, the National League for Nursing (NLN), the American Academy of Nurse Practitioners (AANP) and other specialty organizations envision that within the next five to ten years the BSN to DNP will redesign the educational paradigm for nurse practitioners, clinical nurse specialists, nurse anesthetists', nurse m idwives, and nurse executives in the United States. Service Area The WKU service area i ncludes the Kentucky counties bolded in Table 2 (CPE, 2010). Students enrolled in the WKU FNP program reside primarily in Kentucky and central Tennessee with a majo rity from the geographic service area . Table 2 documents the number of students entering the program from WKU 's service counties in the previous five years.

Yearly graduate follow -up surveys of FNP students document that the students do return to their home area to practice or to a practice area that serves the graduates county of residence. FNP students comprise 86% of the enrollment in the total WKU MSN program. D espite the economic recession and the rising costs of higher e ducation, the enrollment in the WKU MSN program for 2010 reached a high of 157 students (all specialties) representing a growth of nearly 300% from 2000 . Table 3 illustrates the stability of graduation rat es.

In the academic year 2008 , the MSN faculty made the decision to admit students in both fall and spring semester to accommodate eligible students. In 2009, twelve eligible students were not admitted and in 2010, twenty s tudents were not offered admission. The increase in the applicant pool is influenced by several factors. The WKU RN to BSN program saw a large enrollment increase as the program moved from classes offered through interactive television to three distant s ites to 8 an all on -line option. Two area hospitals began the Magnet journey and staff nurses began to see the benefit and received encouragement to obtain a Bachelor's Degree. A stratified sample of registered nurses was completed in the spring of 20 07. The survey was mailed to all registered nurses in Kentucky in the WKU service area and border counties in Tennessee. The mailing lists were received from the KBN and Tennessee Board of Nursing. This survey was an attempt to determine the individual' s educational goals, thus providing data for strategic planning within the School of Nursing. Of the 1,736 individuals who responded, 40 indicated that they plan to pursue the DNP degree within the next five years. A second survey was designed to dete rmine the needs of students currently enrolled in the MSN program. An electronic survey was sent, using Survey Monkey, through the program list serve to all students enrolled in the spring of 2009 (n = 110). Fifty -nine (54%) of current NP students indica ted that they will obtain a DNP within five years of graduation. Recent graduates, (those who graduated in the previous 6 years) were electronically surveyed in 2009 through the alumni list serve and expressed interest in returning to WKU to obtain a DNP degree. Forty -seven nurse practitioners responded to a survey to determine their interest in a DNP. Twenty persons (42%) stated they plan to seek the DNP degree, with the majority of those planning to start a DNP program in 1 -3 years. Seventy -five percent of respondents indicated that accessibility, (scheduling, mode of delivery, etc.), would influence their decision to enroll in a DNP program, and 88% of participants responded they would prefer part-time enrollment. In addition to the above refere nce to WKUs supply of new nurses, there is a well documented shortage of primary care providers in rural areas. All of our graduates find employment as FNPs in the communities in which they live, many of which qualify as rural communities. Health Profile The need for increased and improved access to primary health care in Kentucky is well documented as Kentuckians are among the unhealthiest of US citizens. M any of the reported diseases directly relate to poo r behavioral and social factors and the resu lting chronic diseases translate to higher morbidity and mortality rates and increased health care costs. The most significant and modifiable health risk for Kentucky people is smoking. Although, a dult smokers 9 have decreased from 35.9% in 1990 to 25.2% i n 2009, the rate is still above the national rate of 21%. Among youth, 12 to 17 years, 15.9% reported smoking cigarettes, the highest rate in the nation (CDC, 2010). High rates of obesity and physical inactivity also affect Kentucky. 31.5% of adult Kent uckians are considered obese (CDC, 2009). In 2007, 32% of Kentucky adults reported no regular physical exercise in addition to poor dietary choices. Cardiovascular disease remains the leading cause of death in Kentucky accounting for 38% of all deaths an nually (Kaiser Family Foundation, 2010). Death rates from both lung/bronchus and colorectal cancer are among the highest in the nation (American Cancer Society, 2010). The Kentucky rate for diagnosed diabetes in 2009 was the 4th highest in the nation at 11.4% compared to a national median of 8.3% (CHFS, 2010). Kentucky has high rates of uninsured or underinsured populations as well as problems with access to health care. The Kentu cky Institute of Medicine (KIM) found that 44% of the state's population live in rural areas classified as high poverty and that primary care provider ra tes are 1:3,500, much less than the recommended provider rates (2007) . KIM documented the shortage of physicians and primary care provid ers in Kentucky as 2,298. Additionally, it is anticipated that an additional 600,000 Kentuckians will need access to primary health care as the Affordable Health Care Act is enacted ( L. Juett, personal communication , December 15, 2010 ). In the state of Kentucky , there are 2,339 nurse practitioners, 142 Rural Health Clinics, and 18 Federally Qualified Health Centers that provide services at 94 sites in the state (Kaiser Family Foundation , 2010). In 2007, sixteen percent of the state's population was enro lled in the Medicaid program (Kaiser Family Foundation, 2010). Nationally only 40.2% of physicians report accepting all new Medicaid patients and more than 28% of physicians are not accepting any new Medicaid patient (Center for Studying Health System Cha nge, 2010). Nurse practitioners can increase access to primary care especially in rural and underserved areas. The graduate faculty in the WKU SON had the primary responsibility of DNP curriculum planning, development, implementation, and evaluation. Additio nal members who join as external participants and Adviso ry Committee members include: Connie Smith, WKU alumni and CEO of Commonwealth Health Corporation that includes the Medical Center at Bowling 10 Green, Medical Center at Scottsville, Medical Ce nter at Franklin, CorpCare (VA and Occupational Health Clinics), Urgent Care, Quick Clinics and others, Betsy Kul lman CNO of the Medical Center at Bowling Green and preceptor for current MSN nurse administration students, Marilyn Dubree, Executive Nurse Of ficer and nationally know leader in health care, Melinda Joyce, Director of Pharmacy Services for CHC has taught Advanced Pharmacy for WKU NP and Nurse Educator students for more than 10 years and has experience as an educator, and Dr. Patricia Blewett, ph ysician, preceptor and advocate for NP students. Dr. Suzanne Prevost is a nurse educator and nurse researcher at the University of Kentucky in the College of Nursing. She has many years experience in teaching advanced practice nurses and currently teaches in the DNP program at the University of Kentucky . IV. DESCRIPTION OF THE CHANGE Geographic Service Area, DNP Decisions, and Proposed Start Date The WKU SON faculty supports the mission of the University to be responsive to the needs of area citizens and WKU graduates through the development of new programs and opportunities for lifelong learning. In 2004 , the faculty began following the professional literature and recommendations from AACN, NONPF, and NLN, for a practice doctorate for advanced practice nurses. In 2005, a faculty member entered the University of Kentucky (UK) College of Nursing DNP program. UK, an early adopter of this innovation, would become a model for the WKU DNP program . Faculty began att ending national conferences focusing on DNP programs at this same time to explore different models and to learn from experiences of other program faculty. RNs from the WKU service area began documenting their need for the DNP program in a survey of RNs re siding in south central Kentucky and border counties of Tennessee in 2008. A letter of intent was submitted to CPE in the fall 2009, and CCNE was notified of WKUs intent to develop the DNP program which would be a substantial change in our program. A fall 2011 target for admission of the first class of Post MSN DNP students was established. The faculty has followed recommendations from AACN and plans to admit advanced practice nurses with current specialty certification and nurse administrators to the Post MSN DNP option. The BSN to DNP will also meet the competencies for the FNP graduate and will utilize the current approved courses and clinical practicum experiences. 11 The DNP curriculum provides advanced practice education in evidence -based p ractice, quality improvement, health care systems, leadership, program evaluation, and health policy. The WKU DNP program outcomes are: Critically appraise theoretical concepts and knowledge from nursing and other disciplines and integrate this evidence i n developing, implementing, and evaluating best practices for improved health outcomes. Develop, integrate, and evaluate evidence -based health care innovations while considering cultural, economic, ethical, legal, political, and technological issues across diverse health systems and models. Use and evaluate information systems and technology to improve clinical decision making , and health outcomes. Demonstrate leadership in the critical analysis and application of economic, ethical, political, and social co mponents of health care policy. Demonstrate inter -professional collaboration and leadership skills to improve patient and population health outcomes. Analyze and apply advanced nursing practice concepts of clinical prevention and health promotion to improv e health outcomes in relevant populations. Apply the relevant advanced practice role to improve patient health outcomes and health care systems. WKU will offer the DNP program to MSN graduates of nurse administrator and nurse practitioner programs as a post -master's degree. The BSN to DNP curriculum will allow the student to sit for the family nurse practitioner national certification examination. The MSN faculty completed multiple survey s beginning in 2008 which identified career plans of graduates, area RNs , and APRNs. The results aforementioned student surveys contributed to the decision of the faculty and SON Director to begin the application process toward a DNP program for WKU. The DNP program was included in the strategic plan for the SON beginning i n 2009 and discussion began with college and university administrators to identify financial and related resources for the development of the program. With approval of th ese indivi duals, the faculty began development of the program curriculum and policies with a target date of implementation of the program for fall 2011. Program Description Full-time and part -time progression options have been developed for RNs who have an earned MSN as advanced practice nurses and for BSN prepared nurses who desire to earn the 12 DNP and be prepared as an FNP. Based upon the experience of faculty in a DNP prog ram and the needs assessment of potential students, the courses will be offered using a variety of pedagogies. Each semester selected courses will be taught in a weekend format (Friday evening & Saturday) meeting three weekends per semester. The face -to-face classes will be held at the main WKU campus . The week -end option offers the availability of many class and conference rooms, and improved parking for professional speakers and associates . All class rooms offer needed technology such as computers, projectors, and work space. Online supplemental content and interaction will occur via BlackBoard (Bb) online. This will accommodate practicing nurses. Classes will be in a blended format with traditional classes supported by online content provided by students, peers, and faculty, group work, and discussion boards. As with MSN applicants, discussion about possible clinical practicum sites, research interest and preceptor qualifications are discusse d prior to admission decisions are made. Program policies related to preceptor credentials, responsibilities, student and faculty roles are followed and are published in each appropriate class syllabus and the program Schoo l of Nursing Student Handbook. The SON has a staff person who works with students and faculty to initiate and maintain affiliation agreements currently num bering more than 400 . Faculty has the authority and responsibility for determining the appropriateness of the clinical site and the preceptor based upon professional and accrediting stan dards adopted by the program. Current agreements include hospitals (public and private, Magnet designated large and small in size), long term care facilities, public health departments, home care agen cies, professional and social agencies, managing companies and others. WKU has incorporated 480 clinical hours for Post MSN DNP students and 1000 clinical hours for B SN to DNP students. Based upon AACN recommendations, experiences are planned to build upon the student's prior education, experience, and choice of specialization. It is anticipated that, based upon these student characteristics, the experiences identified by the student and faculty will be varied. The faculty will determine if the a gencies, organizations and identified preceptors can provide the rich immersion experiences needed to help the student 13 build the competencies needed to have success in the final synthesis project and to achieve the program outcomes. The faculty determ ined that for efficiency and economy the program would begin with a Post MSN -DNP program admitting cohorts of 20 MSN students each fall. In year three, 12 Post BSN-DNP students would join the new c ohort. This number would allow for 2 clinical gr oups based upon the CCNE faculty to student ratio (6:1) for clinical courses for year 3, 3 groups for year four, and 4 for year five. This number was established based upon an analysis of current faculty by credential and certification, additional faculty, needs assessment, regulatory changes, and faculty philosophy. The following table presents potential enrollment for the first five years of the program. Table 4 Projected Enrollment in WKU DNP Program Fall 2011 Fall 2012 Fall 2013 Fall 2014 Fall 2015 Fall 2016 Cohort 1 20 Post MSN 20 Post MSN 20 Post MSN Cohort 2 20 Post MSN 20 Post MSN 20 Post MSN Cohort 3 20 Post MSN 12 BSN-DNP 20 Post MSN 12 BSN-DNP 20 Post MSN 12 (BSN -DNP) Cohort 4 20 Post MSN 18 BSN-DNP 20 Post MSN 18 BSN-DNP 20 Post MSN 18 BSN-DNP Cohort 5 20 Post MSN 20 BSN-DNP 20 Post MSN 20 BSN-DNP Cohort 6 20 Post MSN 20 BSN-DNP Total Students 20 40 72 90 110 118 Curriculum model and pathway. MSN prepared nurse practitioners and nurse managers will be admitted to the Post -MSN option of the program. BSN to DNP students will also complete the FNP courses and will be eligible to sit for national certification exams as FNPs from the American Acade my of Nurse Practitioners or the American Nurses Credentialing Commission and to apply for licensing in their states of residence. These graduates will be prepared to provide primary care to individuals across the lifespan in a variety of settings . Stude nts entering the Post MSN DNP will document evidence of previous education and clinical hours completed by submitting transcripts of graduate work and a form signed by program faculty from the university awarding the MSN degree. The integration of the MSN to DNP and BSN to DNP curriculum and course descriptions are found in Appendix C. 14 Selection of Students for the DNP Program Admission to Graduate Studies at WKU is a two -step process first requiring an application with fee and official copies of a ll higher education course work and degrees to the Office of Graduate Studies and Research. The application may be submitted online. Following receipt of these materials, the SON Graduate Program is notified of the student's acceptance to WKU and a recomme ndation form requesting approval for official admission to the major is sent to the Graduate Coordinator. Additional requirements for admission to the DNP program include: Have an earned BSN or MSN, with a specialty in nursing administration or nurse prac titioner, from a CCNE or NLNAC accredited nursing program, GPA - 3.25 cumulative in BSN or MSN.

Dr. Benn ett meets all requirements for a director of nursing un its as identified by the Kentucky Board of Nursing and the CCNE. As documented in her curriculum vitae (Appendix D) she has an earned PhD in nursing and is an FNP with experience nursing practice, teaching including curriculum development, and administrat ion. She currently practices as an FNP. In her role as School of Nursing Director she has administrative oversight for all aspects of management of the programs. Dr. Eve Main, is the program coordinator for the DNP program. Dr. Main has completed a DNP program and is certified as an FNP. She has experience as a faculty and advanced practice nurse. She worked with the graduate nursing faculty to develop the curriculum and plans to implement the program. Her curriculum vitae (Appendix D) documents her scholarship, recognitions, and experiences. V. FACULTY AACN has stated that to \"ensure the scholarship of nursing practice, the faculty ideally should possess a doctoral degree with expertise in the area in which the faculty will be teaching\" (AACN, 2006a, p. 13). All of the faculty currently approved as graduate faculty will be utilized to teach courses in the DNP specific to their education, credentials, and expertise as they meet the standards required by KBN and CCNE. Credentials needed f or graduate faculty was previously described. Faculty in the SON may be employed in either tenure or clinical ranks. Minimum requirements for employment in the SON include an earned MSN, doctorate degree preferred, with at least two years practice experi ence in the area of instruction. All faculty must maintain an active nursing license in Kentucky or a compact state and have appropriate specialty certifications as required. For example, all NPs teaching in the FNP specialty tract are board certified as family nurse practitioners and are licensed as APRNs. To be hired in a tenure line as an assistant professor the individual must have an earned doctorate, appropriate license, or certification, and appropriate relevant experience as noted in the advertis ement for the position. The faculty roster (see App endix E ) identifies faculty credentials, expertise and courses currently taught in the WKU graduate nursing program. Currently graduate faculty 16 teach 12 hours of classes each semester. The expected facu lty FTEs for the DNP program are based on each faculty teaching 9 hours of classes each semester. Additional faculty will be added each year as additional students are admitted to the program. The plan is available in Appendix F . More than 50% of the gr aduate faculty have experiences serving on and/or chairing student theses and dissertation committees. Several faculty serve as adjunct faculty for the University of Louisville and the University of Kentucky. VI. LIBRARY AND LEARNING RESOURCES Library Facilities Nursing materials are housed and funded as a part of the WKU Helm -Cravens Library located on the Main Campus. The main library is open Monday through Friday 7:45 a.m. to midnight, Saturday 9:00 a.m. to midnight, and Sunday 1:00 p.m. to midnight during the fall and spring semesters. Library holdings are updated and expanded by the Health Sciences Librarian respon sible for the nursing collection. A notification service (Coutts) keeps the librarian apprised of new nursing titles. Additionally a weekly new medical book list is accessed from www.majorsbooks.com . Furthermore, the library subscribes to Doody's Core Titles at www.doody.com/dct , which also aids in updating the collection. Library inventory supporting the nursing curriculum is made up of books (monographs), serials, audio visuals, and databases. As of April 2006 , the library held approximately 638,795 cataloged book volumes and subscribed to 3,823 serial titles; 1,942 items were in the \"RT\" collection, where \"RT\" is the Library Congress class assigned to nursing. Addressi ng the health sciences as a whole, 20,023 items were in the \"R -RZ\" call number group. Outdated m aterials are periodically purged by the Health Sciences Librarian with faculty input. As funds permit and with faculty input, audiovisuals and e -books are als o purchased and are increasingly popular; audiovisuals are fully cataloged and are part of the circulating collection in the main library. The library has sixty current individually subscribed nursing journal subscriptions . Many other nursing titles are partially or fully available in online full text through collective agreements with aggregators (primarily EBSCOhost and ProQuest), which are paid for out of other parts of the library budget or funded through the Kentucky Vir tual Library.; 80 titles are listed in the Medicine -Nursing classification of TDNet. Additionally, WKU is currently 17 negotiating with Wolters Kluwer for an institution -wide site license to the Ovid Full -Text Nursing Plus collection of 42 core nursing title s (some of which are already held plus many new titles); if approved, this collection will be activated in 2011. In fiscal year 2010 -2011, $4,187.74 was allo cated to the School of Nursing to purchase monographs, audiovisuals, and new journals and dat abases. Also in FY2010 -2011, an additional $26,787 was allocated for the upkeep of the library's existing nursing journal subscriptions. Interlibrary Loan is available to students and faculty for materials that are not held by the WKU libraries. No fee is charged for Interlibrary Loan. In addition, an Extended Campus librarian who procures materials and conducts searches for Extended Campus students serves the WKU campuses in other cities. A courier and a FAX machine are used to send materials from the main campus in Bowling Green to the Extended Campus sites. The health sciences librarian uses the National Library of Medicine's DOCLINE system to obtain CINAHL and PubMed articles from other participating libraries. Searchable databases - on- and off -campus access . WKU Libraries makes ne arly 200 databases available on and off campus to students and faculty at https://www.wku.edu/Library/deansoffice/online_alphabet.htm#H . The most popular of these are the EBSCOhost databases provided through the Kentucky Virtual Library. Of particular interest to nu rsing students are EBSCOhost's CINAHL with Full Text, MEDLINE, PsycINFO, and Academic Search Premier. The ProQuest Theses and Dissertations Full Text database is another valuable resource, as is the Lexi -Comp drug database. Additionally, a subscription to the Cochrane Library systematic reviews became available in Feburary 2011. Off-campus access is usually through the lib rary's proxy server, which enables WKU users to log in with a single university -provided NetID and password to access most licensed resources, such as subscription e -journals and databases, from any location with Internet access. A list of individual URLs and passwords for popular resources such as EBSCOhost is maintained and is provided upon request to users working from locations such as hospitals where access through the library proxy server is problematic. To enable WKU on - and off -campus users to brow se and search WKU's e -journal titles and to link to full -text e -journal articles retrieved from library databases and from Google Scholar, WKU Libraries uses the TDNet A -Z electronic journals 18 manager. For example, when a nursing student searches EBSCOhost CINAHL, he or she can click a TDNet link to pull up the full text of any article from WKU Libraries' e -journal holdings, either on or off campus. Off-campus users sign in to TDNet using a University -provided NetID/password. The following online journals (see Table 5) are accessible on and off -campus. Table 5 WKU Libraries Online Nursing Journals AJN Gynecology Online AORN Applied Nursing Research Children's Health Care Computer Informatics in Nursing Critical Care Nursing Geriatric Nurse Heart & Lung International Nursing Review Journal for Specialist in Pediatric Nursing Journal of Advanced Nursing Journal of CV Nursing Journal of Emergency Nursing Journal of Nursing Administration Journal of Nursing Education Journal of OB & Neonatal Nursing Journal of Pediatric Nursing Journal of Pediatrics Journal of Professional Nursing Journal of Psychosocial Nursing Journal of School Nursing Kentucky Nurse Medical Care Nurse Educator Nurse Leader Nurse Practitioner Nurse Administrator Quarterly Nursing Outlook Nursing Research Oncology Nursing Forum An additional 31 journals are available in print at the main library. Graduate students can order individual copies of articles via interlibrary loan. This request can be submitted online and is usually return ed to the student via e -mail. There are individual holdings for business, government, leadership studies, public health, communication, and educational leadership that are also available to the student. Assistance and R esourc e. The Reference Center (\"help desk\") on first floor Helm Library is staffed from 8:00 a.m. until 10:00 p.m. Monday through Thursday and until 12:00 midnight Friday through Sunday in fall and spring semesters when classes are in session. A full -time Health Sci ences Librarian serves as liaison to the College of Health and Human Services and is available via e -mail for after -hours consultation. The Health Sciences Librarian is certified by the Academy of Health Information Professionals (AHIP) of the Medical Lib rary Association (MLA), at the distinguished level, has 19 been an MLA member for 30 years, and has published regularly in the field of health sciences librarianship. In the past year, the Health Sciences Librarian has updated her skills by taking MLA -approved CE courses in DOCLINE procedures, e -book acquisitions, library support for evidence -based nursing, and advanced online searching. For students needing in -house access to equipment, the library offers state -of-the art resources. Approximately , 100 computers, several scanners, as sistive technology for visually, hearing , and orthopedically impaired u sers, and audiovisual equipment are all available in the main libr ary. On second floor Cravens, a high -speed open -book scanner allows high -resolution copying of books, photographs, and other images. To guide users in planning library research The WKU Libraries website maintains online subject research guides for all subject areas taught at Western, including nursing. This fall, the Dean signed an agreement with LibGuides to provide a content management framework for better, more easily updated library subject guides. The Health Sciences Librarian has also developed tailored PowerPoint presentations that are made available to nursing faculty for use on their Blackboard sites to help students complete library research assignments. To assist users in obtaining materials not held by WKU Libraries, Interlibrary Lo an is available free of charge to students and faculty. Faculty and graduate students may initiate ILL requests online through Illiad. Alternatively, upon request, the health sciences librarian can obtain CINAHL and PubMed articles from other participati ng libraries via the National Library of Medicine's DOCLINE system. In calendar year 2009, 91 articles were obtained free of charge through DOCLINE for WKU students, faculty, and other area health professionals with an average throughput time of one day. Online access to other health sciences collections is readily available and is federally funded through the National Network of Libraries of Medicine (NNLM). NNLM also funds grants to improve local services; last year, for example, a $200 grant helped students and faculty obtain articles from other libraries via DOCLINE. The Kornhauser Health Sciences Library at the University of Louisville is the NNLM resour ce library for western Kentucky. The Health Sciences Librarian regularly consults with Carol S. Brinkman, Outreach Librarian at the Kornhauser Library, by e -mail or phone as necessary. Additionally, reciprocal free interlibrary loans 20 agreements with UK , UL, and many statewide hospital libraries allow health sciences students and faculty to obtain needed articles without charge, often within 24 hours. Technology Resources Extensive technology resources are available through the Information Technology D ivision for faculty, staff, and students. A Student Technology Brochure is available online and is a beginning point for students with limited technology or for students new to the WKU system. Basic technology support includes webmail, TopNet, and Blackb account ( students@topper.wku.edu ) that is available during enrollment and as alumni. TopNet systems provides a mechanism for Registration, records management such as acad emic transcripts, financial management etc., and as previously describe, Bb is the online course format used by all WKU web and blended courses. Extensive Bb training is available online through video tutorials for students and faculty and online and in c lass instruction for faculty. Student Technology Centers are located at convenient locations across the university. In addition to six locations on the main campus, there is also one Student Technology Center (STC) at each regional campus location, an d another at the South Campus (Community College). STC labs are equipped with the latest hardware, software, scanners, and laser printing. One location, in the Mass Media and Technology Hall, is open 24 hours a day, 7 days a week while classes are in sess ion. Student Technology Centers are restricted for the use of WKU students only, requiring only the WKU ID and passwords to access. Computer labs are available at 8 other campus sites. Student tuition include s 1500 pages of copies each semester. The student may print from a computer to any of the labs. Students take advantage of this benefit. The Mass Media lab, open extended hours daily is conveniently located next door to where nursing classes are usually scheduled. Individual colleges also maintain student computer labs. The College of Health & Human Services provides a student lab, that includes 48 desktop computers an d a computer cart of 24 lab tops that can be checked out by faculty for use in any cla ssroom. The CHHS computer lab also provides printing and lamination of large research posters . The IT Helpdesk provides technical assistance to faculty and students either online or by phone . IT Help can provide remote access to help individuals so lve technology issues, such 21 difficulties in accessing webmail, Bb, downloading software, virus protection, etc. This division also offers assistance with PC and Apple technology, Blackberry and I - phone technology. Laptops can be left with the IT division located in the Mass Media building for issues not resolved online on via phone instruction. For faculty, individual IT support can also be arranged with a consultant in individual faculty offices. IT also maintains the Technology Resource Center o pen to faculty and students, staffed by individuals with education and expe rtise in instructional design. Students may, by appointment, learn to use multimedia equipment and software for instructional assignments in video, audio, or digital graphics. Ins tructors can use the equipment in the Center to develop streaming video, streaming audio, or web graphics for online courses or for instructional web sites. This division will also provide digital audio and video transcribing to meet ADA guidelines, video authoring, audio recording, and video editing. This division will also assist faculty in Bb course design and teach faculty the use of sound effects (maintains library), I tunes, twitter, etc. The IT Division provides new computers to faculty upon hire which are replaced every five years. The Writing Center, offered by the English Department provides individual tutoring, consultation and help rela ted to all aspects of writing. The Center is open during the week every day 10 am - 5 pm but also provides online services. Students can submit papers and questions online and through e -mail and telephone tutors will assist students. VII. PHYSICAL RESOURCES Resources for Class Meetings The DNP program has two tracks, the MS -DNP track and the BS -DNP track. The MS-DNP track will consist of working NP students who have completed a MS level advanced practice program. Thus , most of the classes in the MS -DNP track wil l be offered using a blended delivery approach, incorporating face -to-face sessions scheduled durin g evenings and weekends, online modules, and Interactive Video Services ( IVS) classes. Classroom space for this track should be available , as we will use existing space during non -peak hours. The program will use the currently existing IVS classroom and n ursing lab space during the first two to three years. The current nursing lab, while heavily utilized during the weekdays 8 -4pm, is available for graduate program use during evenings and weekends. Money for some additional lab equipment and 22 models is inc luded in the budget (s ee table 6). The lab has all equipment needed for instruction in advanced health assessment (NURS 503 the only course requiring laboratory instructional space in the FNP program). The current IVS room will accommodate up to 40 stude nts in the on campus classroom and links to extension sites where students located in Owensboro, Elizabethtown, and Glasgow can attend classes. This classroom setup has worked well for our current MS level advanced practice program and we believe it will work equally as well for students in the new DNP program. Classroom and conference space is scheduled online through a central scheduling system, ASTRA, and can be booked months well in advanced to allow for notification of students and for planning. The SON is located in the Academic Complex, located centrally on the main WKU campus. Each of the four floors of the building offer technology enhanced classrooms designed for adult learner comfort, i.e., tables and chairs vs. desks, for computers, etc. The classrooms and entire campus is wireless for internet. All have projectors, monitors, whiteboards, etc. and some are set up for video conferencing. Conference rooms are available on each floor. The Dean's conference room, located on the second floor of the Academic Complex, has all technology capabilities the same as classrooms and is also available for faculty use. Smaller conference rooms are available on the first floor for private meetings with students or other faculty. We will need additional sp ace for faculty offices, one staff office, program support services (mailroom, photocopier, and program files), a conference room and space for graduate assistants. In addition, a new nursing research center will be developed to fully integrate evidence b ased practice and research into the DNP and remaining MS N programs. During the first two to three years of the program, existing space on the main campus at WKU will be made available for the graduate nursing program and new nursing research center. This space is being made available by moving education programs from Tate Page Hall into the new College of Education Building. The graduate nursing program will move into space formerly occupied by the College of Education , and a new graduate nursing program and research center will be developed in that space. Money for minor renovating of this space to meet program needs will come from the DNP program (see building fees) with supplementation from the 23 School of Nursing or CHHS one time funds as needed. We wi ll occupy this space (approximately 8600 sq ft) with minor renovations only, until the new WKU health sciences building is available for occupancy. Within this new graduate program and nursing research center there will be the following: Individual facult y offices (at least 150 sq ft each) sufficient to house the entire nursing graduate faculty A private conference room (at least 400 sq ft) Office space for graduate students A large research center with computers, networking space, file space and meeting area (at least 1,000 sq ft) Staff and program space centrally located to allow all graduate faculty access to the program support staff and files (at least 250 sq ft). Beginning in year 3, with the addition of the BS -DNP students, a need for classroom and lab space will start, at that point significant new money will be made available from the DNP program revenues for lease of a new building (see building fees in table 8). VIII. FINANCIAL SUPPORT WKU has the financial base and stability to support the developmen t of the DNP program and a long -range plan to maintain the resources need ed for a successful program (see Table 6) . Table 6 Five Year Financial Projections Year 1 (2011 - 2012) Year 2 (20102 - 2013) Year 3 (2013 - 2014) Year 4 (2014 - 2015) Year 5 (2015 - 2016) Expenses: Administrative overhead 12,000 12,000 12,000 12,000 12,000 Common cost allocations maintenance 7,000 22,400 40,320 50,400 63,840 Salaries and benefits for projected staff and faculty 100,000 220,000 295,000 375,000 475,000 Memberships, professional development and travel, and consultation 4,000 8,000 12,000 16,000 20,000 Campus laboratory furnishing, equipment and supplies to be purchased prior to program implementation as well as on -going expenses 2,000 2,000 10,000 15,000 15,000 24 Year 1 (2011 - 2012) Year 2 (20102 - 2013) Year 3 (2013 - 2014) Year 4 (2014 - 2015) Year 5 (2015 - 2016) Hardware and software appropriate to meet program objectives 2,000 2,000 10,000 10,000 10,000 Capital equipment and maintenance 2,000 2,000 10,000 10,000 10,000 Resources going to institutions or organizations for contractual or support services 5,000 5,000 10,000 10,000 10,000 Office supplies, printing, postage, etc. 1,000 1,500 3,000 5,000 7,500 Other (specify)Building Lease Fee 0 0 100,800 126,000 159,600 Total Expenses 135,000 274,900 503,120 629,400 fees 140,000 280,000 504,000 630,000 798,000 Internal reallocations Other (specify) 0 0 0 0 0 Total Revenue 140,000 280,000 504,000 630,000 798,000 Explanation of Financial Model The numbers in the table above are based on the following assumptions. Twenty students will be admitted in the fall of 2011 to the Post -MS track of the DNP program. These students will be working full -time as NP s, and therefore most, if not all, will be part of a part -time cohort model. The students will take a total of 14 credit hours per year, which includes summer sessions. Students may opt to enroll full -time, w hich would be 24 credit hours per year, but the financial model in the table above is based on the more conservative assumption that these students will be part -time. Tuition for the WKU DNP program (both post -masters and post - baccalaureate) will be set a t $500 per credit hour. Beginning in year 2, this rate would be adjusted by the same rate of increase that is approved for WKU's regular tuition rates each year. Since the financial model shows all of the revenue calculations based on the $500 per credit hour rate, these adjustments should increase program revenue and the viability of the financial mode. The part -time cohort students will be able to complete the MS to DNP program 25 within 3 years. In year 2, the first 20 students will continue in the program, and an additional 20 students will be admitted to the MS to DNP track. In year 3 we will cont inue to admit 20 students to the MS to DNP track. We will also admit students in the BS to DNP track in Year 3 (2013 -2014) and admit 12 students to this track the first year. All of our current MS tracks will have continued to admit students up until tha t time. After the start of the BS to DNP cohort we will no longer admit FNP students to the MS track and resources that were previously devoted to that track will be diverted to support the increased size of the DNP track. As can be seen from table above, the faculty and other resources needed for the DNP program increase significantly at this time. This is needed to support the heavier clinical and lab resources required by BS -DNP students. There will be a full time and a part time option, but the financi al model again uses the more conservative part - time load of 14 hours per year, including summers. Sufficient classes will be offered so that full time BS -DNP students will be able to complete all program requirements within 3 years. At the end of ye ar 3, we will graduate the first group of the MS to DNP students, and that program will have reached steady state, with graduations being balanced by admissions. In year 4 we will continue to admit 20 students to the MS -DNP track, while increasing the BS -DNP admissions to 18. In year five, we will admit 20 more students to the MS -DNP track, while increasing the BS -DNP students to 24. By year 5 , we should reach a steady state of approximately 40 -45 admissions per year in the DNP program overall. Evaluati on of student demand for both tracks will be ongoing , and if there is more demand in one track versus the other we will move student slots to the track that seems to have the most demand, rather than having students wait to get into one track and have empt y seats in the other track. DNP program revenues will support all costs associated with the program. In addition, starting in year 3, the DNP Program will provide funds to support the lease of a new facility, which should be available for occupancy at that time. The lease fees were calculated at 20% of program revenue, starting in year 3. Cost allocations for common maintenance were held at 8% of program revenue, starting in year 2. Common maintenance allocations include money to support any neede d minor renovations, maintenance, and security, mass transport to the main campus (once the new building is available), the university library , and technical support. 26 In conclusion, we feel that the program revenues from the DNP program, as propose d, will support the need for additional faculty, staff, space and equipment needed to start this program during the fall of 2011, providing all necessary approvals can be obtained by this time. IX. EVALUATION AND ASSESSMENT The fundamental purpose of program assessment at Western Kentucky University is to encourage continuous improvement in educational programs and administrative and educational support services. Assessment is an ongoing process in which programs and units e stablish desired student outcomes or administrative objectives and then measure the extent to which those outcomes/objectives are being achieved. Results of the measurements are used to drive improvements in programs and operations that benefit not only th e students but the entire campus community. Program assessment at Western Kentucky University is not purely an administrative function. It is a collaborative process that involves and benefits students, faculty, staff, and administrators. WKU, CHHS a nd the SON have planned program evaluation processes in which faculty participate at all levels. At the University level, Dr. Doug McElroy, Assistant Vice President for Academic Affairs - Academic Enrichment Effectiveness Western's Strategic Plan, has the responsibility for implementing Challenging the Spirit , provides an ongoing framework for the transformation now in progress at the University. Originally approved by the Board of Regents in 1998, the plan is updated reg ularly as the University pursues its dynamic agenda of evolving, improving, and aspiring. It encompasses an ongoing process and discipline of planning that is embedded in the culture and practices of the University. Success in the first five years of this plan gives the faculty, staff, students, and alumni the confidence needed to achieve the national pro minence (WKU Division of Academic Affairs, 2010). Building upon the values, mission and philosophy of WKU the University Strategic Assessment Plan (2007) is based upon the following goals for the Academic years of 2007 -2012: Increase Student Learning, Grow a High Quality, Diverse, and Engaged Student Body, Enhance Academic Excellence through Premier Faculty and Staff, Improve the Quality of Life in Kentuc ky and Beyond, and Enhance the Financial, Physical, and Resource Capacities of the University. (p. 3) The related student goal is \" Students will engage with communities other than their own in purposeful learning activities that explicitly address thei r capacity and responsibility to contribute to society in 27 positive ways\" ( WKU, 2007, p. 17). Outcome 1. Students will demonstrate their capacity to apply knowledge and training to address relevant issues in community or society. Outcome 2. Students will demonstrate respect for diversity of peoples, ideas and cultures. Outcome 3. Students will demonstrate awareness of their opportunities as responsible citizens living and working in a global society. Individual programs and colleges develop goals and outco mes related to the University goals and report outcome data annually to the Office of Institutional Research and Dr. McElroy. Based upon achievement of the goals individual units are awarded Unit Productivity money to use to enhance the program. The SON has been awarded Productivity Funds at the highest possible level annually for the past five years. In 1998 WKU established an on -going Academic Program Review Committee (APRC) to provide advice and recommendations regarding the overall health of the university's academic programs, both undergraduate and graduate. The focus of the review is on both qual itative and quantitative data, some of which are supplied by Institutional Research, with the balance provided by the faculty in the programs. The overall objectives of the process are to ensure the high quality of the university's programs, and to determ ine how best to utilize the university's resources (budget, personnel, equipment, space, etc.). In addition to the University Assessment Plan, WKU School of Nursing has a comprehensive program evaluation plan that is revised annually. The evaluati on plan is based on CCNE Standards and performance indicators from each program in the SON are monitored. The MSN FNP program evaluation includes course evaluations, graduating student exit surveys, evaluation of resources, alumni surveys, clinical site e valuations, and employer surveys. Quantitative data reports and typed verbatim comments from all of the surveys are given to the Program Coordinators who distribute the results to individual faculty. All of the evaluation forms currently used by the SON allow the student to include qualitative comments. Each survey encompasses a component of the Program Evaluation. For instance annual employer surveys include the student's overall performance and their ability to apply knowledge of method, theories, and processes, communicate effectively, utilizes problem -solving skills and function effectively as a team member. Recommendations from the MSN Committee and the MSN Annual Reports include both faculty and student input and recommendations. Data is co llected and reported to the program evaluation committee, included in the Annual 28 Program Evaluation, reported to the Program Coordinators, and the Director of the SON. The outcomes of the evaluative processes and the recommendations of the Program Evaluat ion Committee are reported to all faculties and the Director of the SON. Student Input into Teaching Effectiveness (SITE) evaluations are completed each semester and results are communicated to the appropriate faculty and the Director of the SON. The pro gram is also evaluated through input from preceptors at clinical sites through student evaluations. All surveys completed by students and employers are anonymous. Further WKU evaluation capacity is a continuing e -mail service for graduates and an alumni list serve. Personal contacts via e -mail or phone are used to track students following graduation, monitor enrollment trends and assist graduating students with job placement. Outcome data from the program evaluation is utilized to make decisions abo ut the program curriculum and policies. The results of surveys are reviewed in a regular meeting of the Graduate Committee. A written response to the evaluation survey results, with any actions plan is documented and copied to the Program Evaluation Comm ittee and any other appropriate individual. 29 References American Association of Colleges of Nursing (AACN).

FACTS : The Master of Accountancy is an advanced program of study designed to provide students with an expanded understanding of accounting and business by building on the foundation gained in an undergraduate accounting program. The program provide s a graduate - level curriculum to accommodate the growing body of knowledge in accounting and equips accounting students with additional skills and competencies.

Teaching methods vary with a mix of lectures, case studies, special projects, and research activities. In addition to com pleting the 30 hours of coursework, each student is encouraged to participate in a professional certification review program. The Master of Accountancy (MAcc) will enable accounting students at Western Kentucky University (WKU) to gain additional skills a nd competencies beyond the undergraduate level, while also providing them a path to meet the 150 -hour requirement for the CPA certificate. The Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS) in its publication titled Accountants and Auditors: Occupational Outlook Han dbook, 2010 -2011 forecasts a strong job growth for accountants. \"Accountants and auditors employment is expected to grow by 22% between 2008 - 18, which is much faster than average of all occupations.\" The program curriculum consists of thirty (30) seme ster hours of graduate courses with eighteen (18) semester hours of required accounting courses, and 12 hours of advisor approved electives. The MAcc is an essential supportive component of the Accounting Program's mission which is to be a leader in prov iding excellent accounting education and preparing students for successful and rewarding careers in accounting and business. BUDGETARY IMPLICATIONS & IMPLEMENTATION DATE : Resources in accordance with AACSB accreditation standards are required to support t he new graduate program. Specifically, one additional academically -qualified faculty member in accounting is required prior to implementation. The program will be implemented when these resources are available, with a target date of Fall 2011 or Fall 201 2. RECOMMENDATION : President Gary A.

FACTS : For some time, the Master of Science in Nursing (MSN) degree has been the terminal degree for specialized advanced nursing practice. The American Association of Colleges of Nursing (AACN) has now identified the DNP as the preferred preparation for special ty nursing practice. The WKU School of Nursing faculty recognizes the need for WKU to award the DNP in order to remain competitive and continue to attract quality students to the graduate nursing program. In the spring of 2010, the Kentucky Legislature p assed SB 127 allowing regional universities to offer a DNP program. Currently the Kentucky Board of Nursing in cooperation with the CPE, is writing the regulations for development and approval of DNP. The DNP program is intended to meet the market dema nds for highly skilled professional nurses in local, state and national job market. This program will make it possible for MSN graduates to obtain the Post Masters DNP and provide a BSN to DNP program for students who do not currently have an MSN. This wi ll enable our students to meet the new certification recommendations and be prepared to successfully compete in the job market. The WKU School of Nursing proposes to offer a DNP program for MSN graduates of nurse administrator and nurse practitioner pro grams and for BSN prepared nurses. MSN - prepared nurse practitioners and nurse administrators will complete a 37 -credit hour Post MSN DNP option. The BSN to DNP program will be a 76 -credit hour program. BUDGETARY IMPLICATIONS & IMPLEMENTATION DATE : In accordance with AACN and KBN accreditation standards, sufficient resources must be provided to support the new graduate program. This program requires the addition of one doctorally -qualified faculty member in nursing. The program will be implemented wh en these resources are available, no later than Fall 2012. As the program grows, together with an anticipated expansion of the BSN program, additional space and faculty resources will be required. The Office of the Provost, in collaboration with the VP of Financial Administration has developed a plan to accommodate these additional costs through direct allocation of additional tuition dollars to the School of Nursing.

This minor is specifically for students who want a career as a Child Life Specialist. In 2009, the U.S. News and Report identified the Child Life Specialist career as one of eleven \"best kept secret careers.\" The child life specialist a re vital members of a multidisciplinary team in most large pediatric facilities, and an increasing number are applying their unique expertise to help children in other environment, including outpatient healthcare facilities, doctors' offices, hospice care , specialized camps, schools, court systems, and funeral home. Whatever the location, child life interventions focus on the individual needs of the child and family.

The department offers 3 undergraduate majors with 9 concentrations, 2 associate degrees, and one certificate program. 39 39 The department is requesting a name change to the Department of Family and Consumer Sciences (FACS). The department would like to align with the national professional name recognized by the American Association of Family and Consumer Sciences (AAFCS). They made the name change in 1994. The American Association of Family and Consumer Sciences (AAFCS) is the only national organization representing family and consumer sciences professionals across practice areas and content specializations. Their members pr ovide guidance and practical knowledge about the things of everyday life, including human growth and development, personal behavior, housing and environment, food and nutrition, apparel and textiles, and resource management, so that students and consumers can make sound decisions and enjoy a healthy, productive and more fulfilling life. FACS Department Mission: The Department views the family, in all its diverse forms, as the cornerstone of a healthy society. Our mission is to improve the well -being of t he family through programs that educate, influence public policy, and help families put research -based knowledge to work in their lives. FACS Department Vision: To be recognized as preparing the best qualified graduates in the Commonwealth. Our focus is on preparing students for living, learning and leading in their communities and career endeavors. The requested name change would have an impact on student recruitment as all high school programs are Family and Consumer Sciences and students are familiar with the content and terminology.
