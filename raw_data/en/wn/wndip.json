Our spine twists and compensates for these issues, causing forward posture. This forward posture is directly related to spinal pain, headaches, mood, blood pressure, pulse, and lung capacity. Posture Correction is a scientific method of healing that fixes structure, restores the nervous system and helps to achieve optimal health. This specific type of posture correction consistently and predictably yields positive health results. Posture Correction Provides: Improved breathing and lung capacity Pain relief An alternative to drugs or surgery Increased healing potential Increased energy (the body doesn't have to work so hard to function each day) Relief to nerve pressure and tight muscles Decreased headaches Improved Balance and Vestibular Issues after your first chiropractic adjustment IMAGINE A LIFE OF Your shoulders not slumping forward when you let your body relax. Breathing easier with your chest and nasal passages feeling more open. More color in your face due to increased blood flow, and many other positive effects depending upon what is out of alignment in your body at this time. CLIENT REVIEWS Dr. Salvitti is an excellent chiropractor. She is extremely talented and caring. Her techniques and methodologies allow for faster healing and overall wellness. I highly recommend her! KELLY F. I feel so grateful to have found Dr. Alissa and to have her so close to home here in West Chester. I have been to over 10 different chiropractors over the years and she is by far the best. She takes a different approach that is more holistic and she really listens. My migraines are almost gone and my neck and body are pain free. Her goal, unlike a lot of chiropractors, is to create affordable care and long term healing so that you don't have to keep coming back. I really recommend her! LAURA B. Dr. Alissa and Barb Salvitti are amazing! They're very professional, and they have a tremendous amount of knowledge on dealing with the effects of chronic Lyme disease. Their FlowPresso lymphatic treatment has been very beneficial. Very relaxing, immaculate office facilities. DAVID T. Dr. Alissa and Barb Salvitti are an excellent team! I trust them completely. ELIZABETH N. True Balance Chiropractic is a wonderful place for whole health care. Barb was so knowledgeable and professional when she gave me my flowpresso lymphatic treatment. It is such an effective therapy and I highly recommend it! Dr. Alissa addressed my areas of imbalance and skillfully adjusted my body so that I felt so much more flexible and open before I left the office. Together they make a very comprehensive health and wellness team. JACKIE T. I've been going for the last few months. Very knowledgeable and you leave feeling improvement in your posture and overall well-being. WILL E. I highly recommend going to see Dr. Alissa! I began seeing her at True Balance in February 2022. I was experiencing some lower back issues and the progress we've made since then is amazing. ABBY F. I started going to True Balance to get my gut health & nutrition back on track, and I am truly blown away by the level of detail and service that Dr. Salvitti provides!

The adjustments, lymphatic draining, and hair analysis have done wonders to my health. We all look forward to every visit!! MEG C. I have been struggling with balance for a very long time along with some other issues. The improvement I am making after treatment by Dr. Alissa is truly amazing. I highly recommend her. She is so thorough, does not rush and will patiently & cheerfully explain and answer any of your questions. She gets 5 stars from me! JUNE P. Alissa is the best! I have had lower back problems for years and have seen many chiropractors but no one has ever made me feel better as quickly as she has. She listened to what was bothering me she addressed the problem and she fixed it. She's amazing! I highly recommend her! FRANCIE W. Doctor Salvitti is the best chiropractor I've had, and has helped me make great strides in dealing with my lower back and shoulder pain in just a few months. In addition, she has helped me become less reliant on medication for heartburn through nutritional supplements and changes to my diet. I sit in a desk over forty hours a week, and I feel much more comfortable sitting now. Doctor Salvitti has documented my posture with each visit, and there has been visible improvement. Doctor Salvitti is professional, kind, and great at explaining things to me. MATT G. I am thrilled with the results that I am having. In just a few short visits my posture, flexibility and sleep have improved dramatically. The combination of chiropractic adjustments, lymphatic therapy, and nutritional balancing are putting me back on the road to wellness. Alissa and Barb's wealth of knowledge, caring and dedication complete the pathway to better health. If you are looking to improve your well-being, look no further than TBC! CHRIS D. Dr. Alissa and Barb make a great team to support your health naturally. Their expertise in treating the whole body, and evaluating you holistically helped identify the root cause of some of my issues vs. just treating a symptom. I have been able to reduce seasonal allergies, improve my gut health, and with the chiropractic adjustments, I can play tennis with less knee pain and more confidence. PAT D. After seeing Dr. Salvitti for only a few months my lower back pain has began to subside substantially. Because she treated the root of the problem rather than the symptoms I am more able to be an active participant in my life. Both her and Barb are extremely informative and have always taken the time to answer my questions thoroughly and thoughtfully. I would highly recommend. AVA M. Alissa is amazing! I've been to a few chiropractors, and Alissa is different - she is very focused on the exact parts of your body that need fixing. I always feel so much better after our sessions, and am finally feeling some relief from my chronic lower back pain. I also have stomach issues and Alissa and Barb spent time explaining what my body needs and giving me the right supplements. Highly recommend True Balance Chiropractic KELLY H. True Balance Chiro has been amazing! After dealing with various ailments such as neck and lower back pain due to hours sitting at a desk and nagging sport injuries, Dr. Alissa's adjustments were incredibly effective in getting me back in balance and addressing nagging ailments I've had for years. Can't recommend the services enough! JEFFREY S. Dr. Alissa is truly remarkable! Not only is she kind and personable but she is also a wealth of knowledge as she answered any questions I had from the beginning. Her care is specific for each individual and after the first adjustment, I felt for the first time in a while that I could take a huge deep breath! Additionally, the office is cozy and welcoming, a perfect place that promotes overall healing. I would HIGHLY recommend!! HOLLY S. Dr Alissa is such a caring and informative doctor. She has taught me so much about my body, health and nutrition. She takes the time to truly get to know you and is so knowledgeable about how the human body works. Her adjustments leave me feeling amazing after every visit and I recommend her "}
