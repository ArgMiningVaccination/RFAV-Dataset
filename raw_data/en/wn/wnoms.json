CDC continues to receive reports of cases that reflect ongoing community transmission in the U.S. and internationally, including a [recent cluster of cases in Chicago](https://www.chicagohan.org/alert-detail/-/alert-details/46678186). To help prevent a renewed outbreak during the spring and summer months, CDC is urging clinicians to be on alert for new cases of mpox and to encourage vaccination for people at risk. Although vaccine-induced immunity is not complete, vaccination continues to be one of the most important prevention measures. CDC expects new cases among previously vaccinated people to occur, but people who have completed their two-dose JYNNEOS vaccine series may experience less severe symptoms than those who have not. More information on the potential risk for new mpox cases is available in the [CDC Health Alert Network Health Update](https://emergency.cdc.gov/han/2023/han00490.asp) and the [CDC Risk of Resurgent Mpox Outbreaks Warrants Increased Prevention Effort](https://www.cdc.gov/poxvirus/mpox/cases-data/risk-assessment/may-2023.html) website. CDC's [Guidance for Planning Vaccination Clinics](https://www.cdc.gov/vaccines/hcp/admin/mass-clinic-activities/index.html) webpage is available to help with planning and implementation of satellite, temporary, or off-site vaccination clinics by public and private vaccination organizations. Resources include: JYNNEOS vaccine is used to prevent smallpox and mpox in people at high risk for infection. During the current mpox outbreak, JYNNEOS is the only vaccine being used in the U.S. JYNNEOS (also known as Imvamune or Imvanex) is licensed (or approved) by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for the prevention of mpox virus infection in people aged 18 years and older. On August 9, 2022, the FDA issued an [Emergency Use Authorization (EUA)](https://www.fda.gov/news-events/press-announcements/monkeypox-update-fda-authorizes-emergency-use-jynneos-vaccine-increase-vaccine-supply) for JYNNEOS for subcutaneous administration to people under the age of 18 years old. The EUA also authorized intradermal administration for people aged 18 years and older. ACAM2000 vaccine may also be used to prevent mpox, but it has not been used in the current mpox response. Provider Resources [JYNNEOS Vaccine Information Statement](https://www.cdc.gov/vaccines/hcp/vis/vis-statements/smallpox-monkeypox.pdf) [CDC Mpox Vaccine Considerations](https://www.cdc.gov/poxvirus/mpox/clinicians/vaccines/vaccine-considerations.html) [Interim Clinical Considerations for Use the 2022 U.S. Fact Sheet for Patients VDH has adopted [CDC mpox vaccination recommendations](https://www.cdc.gov/poxvirus/mpox/vaccines/index.html). Individuals may attest to meeting one or more of the eligibility criteria for vaccination, however should not be required to attest to a specific criterion nor should they be asked details about their eligibility. At this time, most clinicians and laboratorians in the United States are not advised to receive the mpox vaccine for prophylaxis (vaccination prior to exposure). Note: Persons living with HIV or other immunocompromising conditions may be at higher risk for severe outcomes and should be a high priority for vaccination, specifically JYNNEOS. CDC has developed an [mpox vaccine locator tool](https://www.cdc.gov/poxvirus/mpox/vaccines/index.html) to help people find a vaccination site near them. Following exposure of a confirmed mpox case, the CDC recommends that the vaccine be given as soon as possible after exposure, preferably within 4 days. - During days 0-4 after exposure for [intermediate- and high-risk contacts](https://www.cdc.gov/poxvirus/monkeypox/clinicians/monitoring.html)to prevent onset of disease. The sooner an exposed person gets the vaccine, the better. - During days 4-14 after the exposure for high-risk contacts. Vaccination may reduce the symptoms of disease, but may not prevent the disease. - During days 4-14 after the exposure for intermediate-risk contacts, informed decision making is recommended on an individual basis to determine whether benefits of prophylaxis outweigh the risks. Exclusions - Vaccines should not be administered after the onset of illness. If a patient presents with symptoms consistent with mpox illness at the time of vaccination, the patient is no longer eligible to receive the vaccine, regardless of previous eligibility status. Vaccination given after the onset of signs or symptoms of mpox is not expected to provide benefit. - If a patient has been diagnosed with mpox previously, they are not eligible for vaccination. - If a patient develops mpox before receiving their second dose, they are no longer eligible to receive the second dose.

Mpox cases in the United States are becoming increasingly rare, but unvaccinated and under-vaccinated people who could benefit from vaccine may still be at risk. The best protection against mpox occurs 2 weeks after the second shot, so plan ahead and use other strategies to prevent mpox. - It's not too late to get a second dose of JYNNEOS vaccine even if someone received their first dose months prior. - People who are already vaccinated or were previously infected with mpox do not need an additional dose of JYNNEOS vaccine, unless they have ongoing risk because of their job. Dosing - Because JYNNEOS is licensed as a two-dose series, CDC continues to recommend two doses of JYNNEOS vaccine to prevent mpox disease, regardless of how or where it is administered. The two doses should be given 28 days apart. - If the second dose is not administered during the recommended interval, it should be administered as soon as possible based on ACIP's general best practices. There is no need to restart or add doses to the series if there is an extended interval between doses. - Peak immunity is expected 14 days after the second dose. The duration of immunity after one or two doses of JYNNEOS is currently unknown. - Two doses of JYNNEOS provide the best protection against mpox. Route of administration - The JYNNEOS vaccine may be administered using the standard FDA-approved regimen (subcutaneous route) OR the alternative EUA-authorized regimen (intradermal route). - People of any age with a history of developing keloid scars and individuals younger than 18 years of age should receive the vaccine via the subcutaneous route. - Patients with concerns about intradermal administration due to potential stigma or other personal reasons should be offered subcutaneous doses. - CDC recommends that healthcare providers have both subcutaneous and intradermal vaccine administration options available on site so that those unable or unwilling to receive the intradermal regimen, can receive the subcutaneous regimen. Interchangeability of Dosing Regimens - Dosing regimens are interchangeable. For example, a person aged 18 years or older who received one JYNNEOS vaccine dose with the standard subcutaneous regimen may receive a second dose with the alternative intradermal regimen at the recommended interval (i.e., 28 days) to complete the vaccination series. Another example is a person who received the first dose intradermally, had a robust local reaction, and refuses a second dose unless given subcutaneously. In this situation, that second dose can be given subcutaneously. Coadministration with Other Vaccines - Generally, JYNNEOS may be administered without regard to timing of other vaccines. - Orthopoxvirus vaccination should not be delayed due to recent receipt of a COVID-19 vaccine; no minimum interval between COVID-19 vaccination and orthopoxvirus vaccination is necessary. - People, particularly adolescent or young adult males, might consider waiting 4 weeks after orthopoxvirus vaccination (either JYNNEOS or ACAM2000) before receiving a COVID-19 vaccine, because of the observed risk for myocarditis and/or pericarditis after receipt of ACAM2000 orthopoxvirus vaccine and mRNA (i.e., Moderna and Pfizer-BioNTech) and Novavax COVID-19 vaccines and the unknown risk for myocarditis and/or pericarditis after JYNNEOS administration. Provider Resources [CDC Video: How to Administer Intradermal Vaccine in Forearm, Deltoid, and Scapula](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dRsQf_UHsjs) [CDC Interim Recommendations Codes](https://www.ama-assn.org/practice-management/cpt/orthopoxvirus-and-monkeypox-coding-guidance) Recent studies indicate that JYNNEOS vaccination provides real-world protection against mpox. In these reports, vaccine effectiveness was 66-89% for two doses of JYNNEOS vaccine and 36-75% for one dose of JYNNEOS vaccine. No differences in vaccine effectiveness have been observed between intradermal or subcutaneous routes of administration. Two doses of vaccine provide the best protection. While people who have been vaccinated can still get mpox, vaccination may make illness less severe. Provider Resources It is important that communities most affected by mpox have access to timely, clear, and appropriate information, and a safe and effective mpox vaccine to prevent future outbreaks. In the 2022 mpox outbreak, gay, bisexual, and other men who have sex with men (MSM) make up most of the cases. Within this population, mpox cases are disproportionately higher among Black and Hispanic or Latino MSM and, in smaller numbers, Black and Hispanic or Latina women. Gender minorities, including transgender women and non-binary people, have also been disproportionately affected by mpox. Racial and ethnic disparities in mpox vaccination have also been described. A [CDC MMWR](https://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/volumes/72/wr/mm7215a4.htm) from April 2023 described higher unmet vaccination need among racial and ethnic minority groups, particularly among Black and Hispanic males. [CDC's Mpox Equity and Anti-Stigma Toolkit](https://www.cdc.gov/poxvirus/mpox/resources/toolkits/equity.html) provides background, strategies, actions, and resources to advance health equity among populations most affected by mpox. Provider Resources Healthcare providers should be aware of the groups of people recommended for mpox vaccination and the currently available vaccines. Providers who serve individuals at higher risk for mpox exposure are encouraged to become a mpox vaccinating provider. If a provider is unable to vaccinate, they may refer those eligible for vaccination to their [local health department](https://www.vdh.virginia.gov/health-department-locator/) for vaccination or refer them to the [CDC mpox vaccine locator tool](https://www.cdc.gov/poxvirus/mpox/vaccines/index.html) tool to find a location closest to them. Mpox screening, prevention, and treatment should be incorporated into routine sexual health and HIV services to ensure all patients are screened for mpox, assessed for risk factors, counseled on prevention measures, and evaluated for testing and treatment, if indicated. Steps to enroll as an mpox vaccination provider are listed below. Mpox vaccine is not routinely recommended for the general public, and is intended to be used in specific groups that have a higher risk for exposure. If you wish to enroll as an mpox vaccination provider, please follow these steps : - Review the [HHS Provider Agreement](https://www.cdc.gov/poxvirus/monkeypox/pdf/HHS-monkeypox-vaccination-program-provider-agreement.pdf)to understand requirements of mpox vaccine providers and prepare to attest to these requirements. - Email [mpxquestions@vdh.virginia.gov](mailto:mpxquestions@vdh.virginia.gov)to declare intent to order and administer the mpox vaccines in accordance with the HHS Provider Agreement requirements. Providers seeking to order mpox vaccines must enroll in HPOP. Steps to enroll in HPOP will be provided by upon receipt of declaration of intent to order and administer the mpox vaccines in accordance with the HHS Provider Agreement requirements. - Review the following resources that may be adapted to fit your practice site: [VDH Vaccine Guide for Private Providers](https://www.vdh.virginia.gov/content/uploads/sites/214/2022/10/Private-Provider-Monkeypox-Vaccine-Guide-V1.pdf) [CDC JYNNEOS Smallpox and Monkeypox Vaccine Preparation and Administration Summary (Intradermal)](https://www.cdc.gov/poxvirus/mpox/files/interim-considerations/guidance-jynneos-prep-admin-alt-dosing.pdf) [VDH Vaccine Screening and Consent Form Template](https://www.vdh.virginia.gov/monkeypox/consent-form-template/) [CDC Standing Subcutaneous Administration](https://www.cdc.gov/poxvirus/mpox/files/interim-considerations/mpox-jynneos-standing-orders-stand.pdf) [CDC [CDC Guidance for Planning Vaccination Clinics](https://www.cdc.gov/vaccines/hcp/admin/mass-clinic-activities/index.html) - All vaccine providers in Virginia must report any doses administered to the [Virginia Immunization Information ](https://viis.vdh.virginia.gov/VIIS/portalInfoManager.do) [System](https://viis.vdh.virginia.gov/VIIS/portalInfoManager.do) [ (VIIS)](https://viis.vdh.virginia.gov/VIIS/portalInfoManager.do).
