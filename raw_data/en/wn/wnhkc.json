[[1]](#cite_note-1) [[2]](#cite_note-NewMusicBox-2) Composition[ [edit](/w/index.php?title=Healing_Ceremony&action=edit\u00a7ion=1)] Neikrug described his inspiration for Healing Ceremony, writing: I started thinking about people who get sick \u2014 not just cancer \u2014 but anytime someone finds out from their doctor that something is really wrong with them. I thought about the power music has over people; I wanted to write something that would change how your body feels \u2014 helping you calm down, handle stress, get in touch with inner feelings and inner thoughts. He added, \"This is not a treatment, but it surely can put you in the right place.\" [[3]](#cite_note-HuffPost-3) Neikrug, a long-time resident of a Pueblo reservation in [Santa Fe, New Mexico](/wiki/Santa_Fe,_New_Mexico), was also influenced by [Native American](/wiki/Indigenous_peoples_of_the_Americas) culture, remarking, \"I've known the [Pueblo] culture for 25 years, their sense of the earth, of their place connected to the earth \u2014 this is a huge factor in their way of looking at life. It's very powerful in feeling grounded.\" [[3]](#cite_note-HuffPost-3) Discography[ [edit](/w/index.php?title=Healing_Ceremony&action=edit\u00a7ion=2)] A recording of Healing Ceremony was 23, 2013 through [Entertainment One](/wiki/Entertainment_One).
