Nicoline van der Maas, M.D., from the National Institute for Public Health and the Environment in Bilthoven, Netherlands, and colleagues examined possible [adverse effects](https://medicalxpress.com/tags/adverse+effects/) of the Focetria vaccine, given to Dutch women in the second and third trimester of pregnancy, on [infant health](https://medicalxpress.com/tags/infant+health/). Data were collected for the first year of life for infant growth and development (1,739 [infants](https://medicalxpress.com/tags/infants/)) and for infant-related contacts with the general practitioner (GP; 1,671 infants). The researchers found that infants of vaccinated and unvaccinated mothers did not differ in z-score for weight-for-age, length-for-age, and head circumference. There was also no difference in a developmental score based on age-specific assessments of fine and coarse motor function, speech, language, and psychosocial aspects. The number of infection-related GP-contacts was not different between the groups (incidence rate ratio, 1.07; 95 percent confidence interval, 0.91 to 1.28). \"These findings are reassuring for [the] public and professionals and may help the decision making process on maternal immunization in case of a new pandemic and possible other infectious diseases, which can be prevented by this strategy,\" van der Maas said in a statement.
