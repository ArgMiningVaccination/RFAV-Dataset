We believe that creating a balance of Yin and Yang and a constant uninterrupted flow of Qi - the body's energy - is vital to maintaining a healthy life balance. If there is insufficient Qi or the Qi flow is compromised it can lead to an imbalance of Yin and Yang and potentially the body will be prone to illness. The choice of treatment method will be particular to your individual needs with the aim of restoring your body to balance which then promotes recovery and repair. These treatment techniques are proven to work and have been practiced for thousands of years. \"Three things in human life are important: the first is to be kind; the second is to be kind; and the third is to be kind.\" Henry James Acupuncture is the insertion of fine needles into specifically selected acupuncture points on the body known as the meridian channels. There are twelve main meridian channels each of these being associated to an organ of the body. Acupuncture promotes the flow of qi and blood around the body and relieves pain and stagnation. One of the earliest documentations of cupping dates all the way back to 300 AD. Cupping is a traditional Chinese medical treatment method using glass jars that are placed on selected parts of the body where qi and blood flow need promotion. Hot stones in various sizes are heated to temperatures around 120-130 degrees. As a massage tool this enables the practitioner to massage around ten times deeper than with their own hands. Chinese herbs are used to balance the Yin and Yang forces and adjust the Chi Blood, therefore restoring good health. There are many health benefits attributed to drinking Chinese tea, ranging from feelings of well-being to seemingly magical cures. "}
