The tradition and the tools of Gua Sha have been passed down through families for centuries, and only recently have cultures outside of Asia become familiar with its therapeutic benefits. Living Libations is honored to offer a cool Quartz Gua Sha stone that offers the right curves to fit all face and body shapes. You can vivify your visage, beautify your body, and tend to tightness by scraping the Gua Sha stone over freshly washed skin lubricated with a generous squeeze of a Libations serum for great glide. Each stone is parceled in a muslin bag for carrying and storing the Gua Sha tool. "}
