Naturopathic medicine is a primary health care profession built on a truly patient-centred approach that emphasizes prevention, treatment, and optimal health through the use of therapeutic methods and substances that support our body's natural ability to heal and help us achieve sustainable health and wellness. Naturopathic medicine involves treating the whole person through natural therapies.
