The crystals are mainly placed on specific areas of the body called \"chakras.\" Chakra is a Hindu term meaning spiritual energy. According to this teaching there are seven basic energy centres in the body, each having a colour associated with it. Some crystal healers place the same colour crystals as the colour of the chakras on the person to enhance the flow of energy. Crystals are said to direct the flow of energy to the person in a particular part of the body and bring balance to a person's energy. Ultimately, they are used to cleanse the person from bad or negative energy believed to cause an illness. Clearing out the bad spiritual energy alleviates the physical ailment. Crystals are used for physical, mental, emotional and spiritual healing. Not only do people visit \"crystal healers\", in some places, professional nurses are being trained to use crystals for their patients. Additionally, crystals can be worn, placed next to a person's bed as they sleep, and in some cases placed around a person's bath. "}
