The formation of the Health Sciences Authority (HSA) on 1 April 01 marked a significant milestone in our formidableeffort to meet this increasing pace ofchange in the face of globalisation andgrowing complexity in this field. Foundation for the future Whether in the emergence of novelhealthcare products of combined technologies that require new expertiseand systems to make good evaluationsbefore they can be used by patients, orin investigative, scientific and analyticalwork for and beyond judiciary andstatutory means, a broad range ofdisciplines, expertise and capabilitieswill have to be engaged. The formation of HSA sees a larger and stronger critical core of medical,pharmaceutical and scientific expertisethat can come together synergisticallyto achieve greater scientific andregulatory excellence. This unique integration and combination of expertiseacross different specialist fields isdeployed through HSA's 8 professional centres, yet all under one roof. Coming together as a single agency also means that Singaporeans and corporationsenjoy a seamless regulatory process for all therapeutic products, including newand innovative products that promise totransform the way doctors diagnose, treatand prevent diseases that today stillafflict many in our society. Setting Standards For HSA to achieve its mission of excellingin applying science to safeguard publichealth and safety demands, HSA has begun to engage new strategies, andmeet new standards. Our impetus to maintain a global perspective in this age of globalisationand global access to information ensuresthat the quality, safety and efficacy ofhealthcare and blood products available in Singapore and the quality ofinvestigative and analytical service arebenchmarked with the best in the world.Networks are being built and strengthened with our leadingcounterparts in the US, UK, Europe andAustralia in order to keep pace with the latest technology and the bestinternational practices and standards. We also recognise that in the present climate of increasing globalisation, moreand more biological and biotechnologicalproducts as well as traditional andcomplementary therapeutics will movefreely across lowered market barriers.Regulatory decisions are expected to benot just effective and transparent, but also be made in a timely manner toensure access to improve the quality oflife. Strategic alliances with our overseasregulatory counterparts will therefore speed up information exchange andcollaboration, so essential in meetingthe challenges of protecting public healthand safety whilst yet ensuring timely access.In FY 02, we look forward to formalising ourcollaboration with the Ther apeutic Goods Administration, Australia. To meet these new challenges, it would be necessary for the depth and breadthof our professional expertise and capability to be developed to the levelof international recognition. New capabilities in molecular biology,genetics, toxicology and pre-clinical evaluation will enable us to leverage onour scientific expertise and resource tothe optimum for the benefits of ourstakeholders. Synergies between variousspecialised fields will need to be forged.Already we have begun to seek expertconsultancy and training from thecountries that enjoy world renown statusfor our different domains of work. We see an increase in different levels andareas of professional exchanges, as wellas our professional representations ininternational programmes ranging fromdrug quality assurance, food safety, radiation protection, forensic inspection and audit, blood quality and safety,regulatory evaluation to regional and global harmonisation. We continue toencourage and acknowledge innovationand enterprise as well as research anddevelopment that will ultimately be useful for our agenda. Closing Remarks In this first infancy year of being, I amhappy to note that aside from continuedeffort to implement the ongoingdevelopmental projects, HSA has laid a strong foundation to position itself totake on the challenges ahead. For thenumerous developments in the year under review, I would like to express my gratitude to the Board Members for theirinvaluable advice. To the managementand staff of HSA, I convey myappreciation for their dedication, passionand commitment to their professionalwork and their contribution to theorganisation. Working together as onefamily for one future, HSA will move closer to its vision to being world classfor scientific and regulatory expertise in health sciences. Professor Hang Chang Chieh ChairmanDr Clarence Tan Chief Executive Officer9 ceo'sreport In a world where science, medicine and technology increasingly combine andconverge to create ever more advancedand complex solutions, products andservices in healthcare, the mission ofsafeguarding public health and well-beingeffectively and timely has become morecritical than ever. A key priority for the first year of HSA since formation on 1 April 01 has beenconsolidation to sharpen our professionalexcellence and organisational efficiency. Our strategic reviews directed at two levels- enhancing the effectiveness of ourprofessionals and enhancing the efficiencyof our processes - will ensure that HSA remains relevant, responsive and ready toaccomplish our mission today and to facetomorrow's challenges.Promoting Professional Excellence High level strategic objectives for theAuthority were defined at the Vision, Mission & Strategy workshop held beforethe formation of HSA. These high levelstrategic objectives were then cascadedto the 8 Professional Centres through acomprehensive process of environmentalscanning, SWOT analysis, and scenarioplanning, culminating with theimplementation of the Balanced Scorecard. On the regulatory front , a comprehensive review of the regulatory framework for healthcare products has been initiated to consolidate the laws governingmedicines and health-related products, including medical devices, under ourpurview. Our stakeholders can lookforward to a progressive and pragmatic regulatory environment for healthcare products that is benchmarked with theleading regulatory agencies worldwide. To effectively deliver our mission to safeguard public health and safety, we recognise thattransparency of our policies and processesis necessary to build public confidence andincrease public awareness of safe practiceswhen using the products we regulate. HSA is in touch with our stakeholders. A new initiative by our Centre for Pharmaceutical Administration will resultin an abridged drug evaluation pathwaythat pharmaceutical companies can makeuse of to reduce their timeline for marketingapproval of products which have been evaluated and approved by our benchmarkregulatory agencies. To a ddress the increasing worldwide trend of counterfeitdrugs, our surveillance and enforcement functions will continue to be strengthenedand globally networked. The Voluntary Product Registration Scheme for medical devices, to be rolled out by our Centre for Medical Device Regulation,bears testimony to how positiveengagement in a strategic partnership withindustry can strike a balance betweenensuring the safety and effectiveness ofmedical devices available in Singapore and address industry concerns to minimise delayin the time to market. Our comprehensive post-marketing surveillance programme continues to ensurethat the benefits of approved healthcareproducts continue to outweigh any newly-discovered adverse effects. This programmeis being progressively extended beyondwestern drugs, cosmetics and Chineseproprietary medicines to cover healthsupplements, biologics, medical devicesand blood products. Efforts are being madeto further strengthen our network withoverseas regulatory agencies for swifteralerts and assessments. Recognising the dynamism and diversity of a globalised market, we participate inregional and international harmonisationinitiatives for drugs, medical devices andradiation safety as part of our commitmentto accelerate product and servicedevelopment, facilitate trade and publicaccessibility while tapping on newtechnical knowledge. Our involvement in regulatory harmonisation also serves to contribute asa global player and to achieve greatermedical, pharmaceutical and radiation safety for Singaporeans.Besides working actively in a number of ASEAN technical co-operation initiativesinvolving healthcare products, we are alsoactive in the Global Harmonisation TaskForce (GHTF) for the harmonisation ofregulatory requirements for medical devices. We currently chair the Asian Harmonisation Working Party, a regional grouping working towards implementing the GHTF consensusand approach in Asia. In radiation safety , our Centre for Radiation Protection participates in various WorldHealth Organisation (WHO) committees and the International Atomic Energy Agency inglobal and regional project formulationsand standards harmonisation activities.At the investigative, scientific and analytical front , the drive to meet our stakeholders' expectations challenges us tostrive for benchmarking and internationalrecognition of our standards through formalaccreditation exercises. Our Centre for Forensic Science (CFS) has successfully achieved the American Societyof Crime Laboratory Directors / Laboratory Accreditation Board re-accreditation for another 5 years. This bears testimonyto our commitment to provide aninternationally recognised forensic scienceservice for the administration of justice inSingapore. Further, in June 01, the UnitedNations International Drug Control Programme has appointed CFS' Narcotics ILaboratory to be the reference laboratoryfor analysis of controlled drugs for the seized materials group. Likewise, our Centre for Analytical Science (CAS), the largest single-site testinglaboratory facility, is seeking accreditationby the Singapore Accreditation Council-Singapore Laboratory Accreditation Scheme(SAC-SINGLAS) under the new ISO/IEC17025 in chemical, biological andenvironmental testing fields. Our clientstherefore can exploit this accreditationstrategically for their overseas markets.In addition, CAS' Food Laboratoryand Pharmaceutical Laboratory continueto be internationally recognised asWHO Collaborating Centres for FoodContamination Monitoring and Drug QualityAssurance respectively. I am pleased to highlight that our pursuit of professional excellence has led to the development of a novel system to extract bioactive ingredients from herbal medicinalproducts using pressurised liquid extraction in a more efficient and cost-effective meansthan conventional methods. This innovationhas been filed for patent protection andholds good prospect for commercialisation. Strategic alliances leveraging on the strengths of partners serve to enhance our deliverables to our stakeholders. We maintain strong collaborative partnerships with academia in theDepartments of Pharmacology, Pharmacyand Chemistry of the National University ofSingapore. In April 01, we formalised ourpartnership with the Singapore Red CrossSociety (SRCS) as the National Blood DonorRecruiter. The tradition of SRCS forvolunteerism and humanity and its strengthin community outreach and networking willno doubt encourage more Singaporeans to give the gift of life. Setting standards in transfusion medicine , our Centre for Transfusion Medicine (CTM)is internationally renown for the quality ofour blood safety practices, which ensuresthat more than 64,000 units of donatedblood per year are safe for use by patientsin our hospitals. CTM's well documented and high quality work performance standards have beensingled out as a national model under theNational Model Company Programme by Productivity & Standards Board Singapore(now SPRING Singapore). Its emphasis on highly sophisticated quality management in all areas of blood transfusion including recruitment of blood donors,testing, processing, production, distributionand use of blood and blood products hasbeen recognised as exemplary by WHO. InFY 02, CTM, already a WHO CollaborationCentre for Transfusion Medicine, has beenidentified as a regional Quality Management Project training centre of the Western PacificRegion, and will co nduct intensive training for many national blood programme officers in the region.11 Promoting Innovation and Organisational ExcellenceImproving our organisational efficiency isan important step towards moulding HSAinto a high-performance outfit. To chart and catalyse our journey towards organisational excellence, a new Office forInnovation and Enterprise, or in short, In 2Vent, was established. In2Vent led the initiative to implement the use of the Balanced Scorecard (BSC) as astrategic and performance managementtool to align operational objectives withour high level mission and vision. Overtwo days in October 01, a Strategic Reviewand BSC Retreat was organised for seniormanagement to map the first set of strategic objectives and draft the strategy map forHSA's Scorecard. Roadshows and staff communications built corporate awareness,while 13 BSC Development Teams wereformed in the professional centres and corporate departments to encourage staffownership and participation.Concurrently, the journey to achieve the People Developer Standard and Singapore Quality Award was commenced. InNovember 01, our Centre for Analytical Science was the first within HSA to embarkon a pilot trial of Business ExcellenceAssessment for Continuous Improvement to seek the Singapore Quality Classrecognition by FY02. Moving in tandem to serve, not just the ongoing developmental projects, but alsothe new initiatives and standards arisingthrough all our centres' strategic reviewsis the ongoing development of newmanagement systems to harness new knowledge and technology in informationmanagement, human resource, finance, corporate services and corporatecommunications. Our Commitment Globalisation and rapid advances in science,medicine and technology will continue to pose many challenges for the future. Thisfirst year of consolidation and building onour strengths and capabilities has firmlyestablished the vital foundation for ourjourney towards regulatory, professionaland organisational excellence. In thecoming year, we are confident that we cancontinue to strengthen our resilience, stretch the reach of our capabilities, and surmount the challenges of the day with fortitude. In so doing, we remain committed to achieving our mission to excel inapplying science to support healthcareservices and regulation, serve theadministration of justice and enhancesafety in our community.

Pre-market Evaluation and Licensing of Medicinal ProductsCPA carries out pre-marketing evaluation ofmedicinal products before they are allowed to be marketed in Singapore. Only products thatmeet the approval criteria of safety, efficacy and quality are granted product licences. For the period January 01 to March 02, 421 new product licences were issued with the average timeline of 4.4months. A total of 2,038 product licenceswas also renewed. Ofthe 421 new products centre for pharmaceutical administration The Centre for Pharmaceutical Administration (CPA) , one of HSA's 8 centres, was formerly known as the National PharmaceuticalAdministration under the Ministry of Health. As the national regulatory agency for medicines and health-related products, CPA's primaryobjective is to safeguard public health byensuring that medicinal and health-relatedproducts in Singapore meet appropriatestandards of safety, quality and efficacy.Products which are currently being regulated,include western medicinal products, Chineseproprietary medicines, health supplements andcosmetic products. CPA is also responsible forthe regulation of clinical trials in Singapore21 Regulation of Clinical Trials For the period January 01 to March 02, 211 newclinical trial certificates were issued. In addition,another 25 certificates were issued for extensionof the trials. New Clinical Trials Approved in January 01 to March 02 Phase III (43.6%)Phase II (30.8%) Phase IV (14.2%)Phase I (11.4%)Forensic Classification Review In response to consumers' expectations to havegreater access to medicinal products that canbe used safely for self-medication, with effectfrom 1 July 01, CPA implemented a new systemfor the systematic review of forensic classification of medicinal products. In addition to product owners, healthcare professionals and consumers may request forspecific products to be considered forreclassification. To facilitate the process, the guidelines for submission of requests have beenposted on the website. At the end of March 02, there were 7,438 licensed products in Singapore. They were distributed,by the three forensic classifications, as follows:The number of clinical trials being co nducted in Singapore has been increasing over the last fewyears. There is also a significant increase in thenumber of early phase trials. In view of the need to enhance the safety of trial subjects and toimprove the approval process, CPA has embarkedon the review of the regulatory framework forclinical trials. The review, which is beingundertaken in consultation with the MedicalClinical Research Committee (MCRC) and theClinical Trials Co-ordinating Committee (CTCC)is targeted for completion at the end of 2002. Forensic Classification Prescription Only Medicines (POM) TotalPharmacy Only Medicines (P) General Sale Manufacturing Practice CPA became the 1st Asian member of the Pharmaceutical Inspection Co-operation Scheme (PIC/S) with effect from 1January 00. Subsidiary legislation was gazetted underthe Medicines Act to adopt thePIC/S Guide to GMP for Medicinal Products as the GMP standard for Singapore with effect from 1 September 01.At least 15 sets of technical guidance notes, developed in consultation with the HSA Quality Control Advisory Committee, were madeavailable to the industry to facilitate theirGMP implementation. An extensive review and revision of the qualitymanagement system to include GDP audit and licensing of importers and wholesale dealersof western medicinal products and Chinese proprietary medicines was co nducted.Licensing of manufacturers, assemblers, importers, wholesale dealers and pharmacies125 manufacturers' and assemblers' licenceswere issued for western medicinal products,Chinese proprietary medicines, cosmeticproducts and controlled drugs from January01 to March 02. During the same period, 300 wholesale dealers' licences and 337 pharmacy certificates werealso issued. 530 site inspections were carriedout before licences/certificates were issuedto ensure that these companies comply withGood Manufacturing Practice (GMP) and GoodDistribution Practice (GDP) standards, legalrequirements under the Medicines Act, Poisons Act and the Misuse of Drugs Regulations, as well as Singapore's obligations under theUnited Nations Conventions on Psychotropic Substances and Narcotic Drugs. More than 20 different types of licences and certificates were issued including 505World Health Organisation Certificates of Pharmaceutical Products / Free Sales Certificates,612 import licences and 109 export licencesfor psychotropic substances and narcotic drugs and 898 Poisons Licences.23 Regulation of Chinese Proprietary Medicines The year 2001 saw the full implementation ofChinese proprietary medicine (CPM) control,which was carried out in 3 phases over a spanof 3 years since 1999. Following the successful conclusion of the third and final phase of CPMcontrol which took effect from 1 September01, all CPMs are required to be assessed forsafety and quality and meet full labellingrequirements before they can be marketed in Singapore. All importers, wholesalers, localmanufacturers and re-packers of CPMs must also be licensed. As of 31 March 02, the numberof licensed CPM importers, manufacturers, re- packers and wholesale deals stood at 194, 23,30 and 266 respectively. During the period January 01 to March 02, 4,696 applications for CPM product listing were receivedand 4,196 products were allowed to be listed.As of 31 March 02, 9,149 CPMs were listed. The adverse effect reports from overseas prompted the review of the control measures forthe following herbs: Aristolochia, RadixTrichosanthis and Cortex Magnoliae Officinalis. carried out inconsultation with the CPM Advisory Committee,concluded that the present control measureswere adequate.To enhance the training of Chinese herbal dispensers, CPA facilitated the organisationof the Chinese Medicinal Materials Dispensers Training Course by the Singapore Traditional Chinese Medicine Organisations Committee inconsultation with experts from BeijingUniversity of Chinese Medicine. The training plan was endorsed by the Traditional ChineseMedicine Practitioners Board. Regulation of Health Supplements Currently health supplements are not subjectto any licensing or pre-marketing assessmentbefore they can be sold locally. Healthsupplement dealers must not contravene thelegislation governing medicinal productsespecially the Medicines Act, the Poisons Actsand the Medicines (Advertisement & Sale) Act.The classification status of hair-dyes containing diamines was reviewed with theobjective of making hair-dyes more accessibleto consumers. The review resulted in thereclassfication of hair-dyes containing diamines as Category 1 cosmeticproducts, with effect from July01. As cosmetic products, theycan be sold in all retail outlets after they have been assessed and licensed. Safety Monitoring of Medicinal Products CPA continues to monitor the safety ofmedicinal products after they have been licensed for marketing in Singapore.Healthcare professionals are encouraged to report suspected adverse drug reactions (ADRs) to CPA's Pharmacovigilance Unit. All ADRsreported are assessed and captured into an ADR database which allows for further analysisof these important signals. As a result of the enhanced efforts to encourage healthcare professionals to reportADRs, a record number of ADR reports wasreceived. Approximately a quarter of the 609 reports submitted comprised seriousADRs. These serious ADRs were investigatedfurther to assess whether any regulatoryactions would be required to a ddress any safety concerns.To ensure that unsafe products were promptly removed from the market, CPA closely monitored the reports of adverse reactions associated with health supplements. In FY 01,adverse reactions arising from the followingproducts as Serbuk Jarem (Encok). Appropriate regulatory actions were subsequently taken to remove theseproducts from the market to protect publichealth and safety. Regulation of Cosmetics In FY 01, 13,794 cosmetic product licenceswere issued. These included new cosmeticproduct licences, renewed licences and amendedproduct licences. During the same period, 277import licences were issued. A set of guidelines pertaining to the import,sale and advertisement of health supplements was distributed to inform the trade of thecurrent legislative controls imposed on healthsupplements. The guidelines were posted onthe website in January 02. The development of a specific framework for the regulation of health supplements wasinitiated and targeted for implementation in2003. While the framework was beingestablished, an enquiry service was establishedto handle enquiries related to healthsupplements from the trade and the public. Atotal of 3,769 enquiries was handled in FY 01.25 During the year, doctors and pharmacists in Singapore were alerted to the serious ADRsassociated with allopurinol and kava-kavacontaining products which were marketed ashealth supplements. Two issues of ADR News were also published to highlight ADRs of currentdrugs as well as case reports of serious ADRs. The publication, which has received positivefeedback from healthcare professionals, willcontinue to be HSA's important communicationchannel with healthcare professionals inSingapore to enhance drug safety in ourcommunity.Regulation of Medical Advertisements and Sales PromotionsCPA regulates medical advertisements andsales promotions for medicinal products toensure that the information presented to thepublic is accurate and not misleading. Suchmedical advertisements are carefully screened before permits are issued. In FY 01, 1,445permits for advertisements and salespromotions were issued. As a result of a policy review, advertisements of rubber condoms no longer required permits from CPA with effect from February 02. Permitholders were informed of the change and advised to contact relevant authorities onmatters concerning advertising of condoms. Investigation, Surveillance and Prosecution All complaints and feedback from the publicon any medicinal products are investigated.From January 01 to March 02, 188 complaintsfrom various sources were investigated. In collaboration with national and international enforcement agencies, 26products, including CPMs, were found to beadulterated with sildenafil. 5 of these productswere imported and sold in Singapore, whilethe others were detected before entry intoSingapore. The parties responsible for the 5adulterated products were prosecuted and the adulterated g oods with a street value of $600,000 were seized. During the same period, 17 cases were prosecuted in Court resulting in a total of$150,700 in fines imposed on 38 charges underthe Poisons Act, and a case with a 10-weekimprisonment term. 141 compositions wereissued under the Medicines Act for a total of$109,150 in composition fines. The indiscriminate sale of cough mixture containing codeine wasanother focus area targeted forenforcement during the year. An undercoveroperation resulted in the conviction of aregistered pharmacist. A number of joint operations was also co nducted with the Singapore Immigration and Registration,Singapore Police Force and Central NarcoticsBureau to bust illegal operations which involvedorganised groups of immigration offenders. Other enforcement activities carried outincluded a case of arrest for the sale of WeiGe Wang, a product containing sildenafil andone company was compounded for makingmedical claims on a health supplement product, Elixir Youth Enhancing Formula 1. To detect illegal sale of medicinal products over the internet, the local websites offeringhealth products for sale are routinely monitored and screened. Through the routine surveillanceof the internet and subsequent investigation, an elusive case of illegal sale of prescriptiondrugs, including Viagra\u00ae, on 3 internet auction websites, was successfully cracked. The auctionpages on the websites involved were removed,and the illegal vendor was subsequently charged under the Poisons Act. Tobacco Regulation During the mass renewal exercise in August01, 4,550 tobacco retailer licences wererenewed. As of March 02, there were 7,576 tobacco retailers in Singapore who had beenissued with the required licences. In FY 01, 40retailers were caught selling cigarettes without valid licences and appropriate enforcementactions were subsequently taken against them. CPA continues to intensify its enforcement efforts to prohibit smoking by youths under18 years old.

Its 7laboratories provide analytical and consultingservices to many government regulatory agenciesand the private industries in the areas of foodand drug safety, cosmetics, environmental and industrial healthprotection, and thetesting of cigarettesand tariff items. CAS handled a total of 19,732 samples and co nducted 61,893 tests for the year in review. centre for analytical science Accreditation of Laboratories under ISO/IEC 17025The laboratories in CAS were first accredited bySingapore Accreditation Council - SingaporeLaboratory Accreditation Scheme (SAC-SINGLAS)under ISO/IEC Guide 25 in 1997. In FY 01, thelaboratories sought accreditation under the newISO/IEC 17025 in chemical, biological and environmental testing fields and the resultswould be announced in FY 02. Each laboratorywent through a 2-week surveillance assessmentby SAC-SINGLAS to demonstrate capability andcompetency to meet the highest internationalstandards of laboratory management and practice.63 Asia Pacific Laboratory Accreditation Co-operation CAS and SAC-SINGLAS jointly organised aproficiency testing programme on food for theAsia Pacific Laboratory Accreditation Co-operation (APLAC) as part of Singapore's contribution tothe region. CAS provided technical expertise inthe programme which included samplehomogeneity, validation of target value and statistical analysis of results from 90 participatinglaboratories from 30 countries in the AsiaPacific region. International Collaboration CAS works closely with the World HealthOrganisation (WHO) in various activities with the designation of its two laboratories as WHO Collaborating Centres.was re-accreditated for another 4 years from 2001 to 2005. Review of monographs for theInternational Pharmacopoeia and evaluation of test procedures and technical articles and validation of international standards were also carried out for WHO. The 2 WHO Collaborating Centres have provided advanced training for about 20 WHO fellowsfrom developing countries such as Nepal,Myanmar, Indonesia, India, Vietnam, Bangladesh and Sri Lanka. A tr aining workshop on food safety for laboratory technicians in Myanmar was also co nducted. WHO Proficiency Testing Programme CAS was invited by WHO to take part in aProficiency Testing Programme, a new initiativewhich was open to selected governmentlaboratories. It is a good opportunity for CASto benchmark its Pharmaceutical Laboratorywith other countries' laboratories as theProgramme assesses the technical competenceof government laboratories through a confidential system of testing of blind samples. Its Food Laboratory, a WHO Collaborating Centre for Food Contamination Monitoring, submitted 9,811 results of food contaminants from ournational food surveillance programme to WHO in FY 01. The data provided useful informationfor WHO to make global comparison with other countries and helped WHO to identify trends andminimise risks of contaminants to consumers. Its Pharmaceutical Laboratory, a WHO Collaborating Centre for Drug Quality Assurance,International Publications Through an emphasis of research anddevelopment, 5 papers were completed and accepted for publication ininternational journals in FY 01. The Year Ahead In the year ahead, CAS targets to achieve accreditation under the new ISO/IEC 17025 andthe SQC award. Other than participating in WHOGlobal Proficiency Testing Programme forbenchmarking of government laboratories, CASis developing a work plan for the designationas a new WHO Collaborating Centre for IndustrialHealth. CAS is also developing new services in clinical trial support, safety of plastics, healthsupplements and carbon monoxide in cigarettes.In addition, it is working towards anotherpatent for another novel extraction techniquefor herbal preparation. 65 Quality Journey in Pursuit of Business Excellence CAS embarked on the journey to business excellencewith a Quality Excellence Workgroup formed inNovember 01. The workgroup was formed to co nduct self-assessment using the Business Assessment forContinuous Improvement (BEACON) instrument toidentify strengths and areas for improvement. A formal application would be made in early FY 02 for CAS to join the Singapore Quality Class (SQC). Patent Filed A novel system to extract bioactive ingredientsfrom herbal medicinal products using pressurisedliquid extraction was developed in its PharmaceuticalLaboratory. The new technique is more efficientand cost-effective than conventional methods. Ittakes only 20 to 30 minutes as compared toconventional methods which can take up to 18hours. A patent is filed for this invention and there is prospect for the system to be commercialised.senior management top row from left to right Dr Clarence Tan Chief Executive Officer Dr John Lim Director, Centre for Pharmaceutical AdministrationAg Director, Centre for Drug EvaluationA/Prof Patrick Tan Director, Centre for Transfusion Medicine Dr Paul Chui Director, Centre for Forensic Medicine Director, Office for Innovation & Enterprise Dr Chow Shui Tse Director, Centre for Forensic Sciencebottom row from left to right Mr Wong Yew Sin Director, Centre for Medical Device Regulation Mr Vincent Fong Director, Corporate Management Group Mr Stephen Chong Director, Centre for Radiation ProtectionMrs Tan Shook Fong Special Pharmaceutical Advisor Mr Chua Teck Hock Director, Centre for Analytical Science A/Prof Ng Tju Lik Senior Scientific AdvisorQuality Service Manager 67principal officers (as at august 02) Chief Executive Officer Dr Clarence Tan Senior Scientific Advisor Quality Service ManagerA/Prof Ng Tju Lik Special Pharmaceutical Advisor Mrs Tan Shook Fong OFFICE FOR INNOVATION & ENTERPRISE Director Dr Paul Chui Assistant Director, Organisation & Business DevelopmentMs Lim Peck Seah CORPORATE MANAGEMENT GROUP Director, Corporate Management Vincent Fong Deputy Director, Corporate Communications Ms Jeannie Thng Deputy Director, Corporate Services Chua Hong Tong Deputy Director, Finance Philip Ngiam Deputy Director, Human Resource Mrs Sarojini Padmanathan Deputy Director, Information Management Dr Bosco Chen BloodworthCENTRE FOR PHARMACEUTICAL ADMINISTRATION Director Dr John Lim Compliance & Complementary Medicines Division Senior Deputy DirectorYee Shen Kuan Head, Prosecution Yee Shen Kuan Head, Investigation & Surveillance R Sivalingam Head, Tobacco Regulation Norman Chong Head, Chinese Proprietary Medicine Ms Chu Swee Seng Head, Health Supplements Chao Ye Peng Product Evaluation & Registration Division Deputy DirectorMrs Marie Tham Head, Drug Registration Dr Kerwin Low Acting Head, Clinical Trials Dr Kerwin Low Head, Cosmetics Control Mrs Marie Tham Manufacturing & Quality Audit Division Deputy DirectorSia Chong Hock Head, Good Manufacturing Practice Sia Chong HockHead, Good Distribution Practice Sia Chong Hock Head, Certification Dr Lai Weng Fai Pharmacovigilance, Communications & Research DivisionDeputy DirectorMdm Suwarin Chaturapit Head, Pharmacovigilance Ms Chan Cheng Leng Head, Information & Research Ms Chan Cheng Leng Head, Pharmacoeconomics & Drugs Utilisation Mdm Liasion Mdm Suwarin Chaturapit Head, Regulatory Support Ho Yu Nam CENTRE FOR DRUG EVALUATION Acting Director Dr John Lim Deputy Director & Clinical Pharmacology Advisor Prof Vernon Oh Assistant Director & Senior Medical Reviewer Dr Gerard Wong Senior Regulatory Scientist & Training Coordinator Dr Vivian Chan Regulatory Scientist & Corporate Management CoordinatorTan Tek SengCENTRE FOR MEDICAL DEVICE REGULATION Director Wong Yew Sin CENTRE FOR RADIATION PROTECTION Director Stephen Chong Head, Environmental Radiation & Radioactive Waste ManagementStephen Chong Head, Ionising Radiation Control Ms Annie Tan Head, Ionising Radiation Dosimetry Ms Annie Tan Head, Non-Ionising Radiation Control Dr Phua Tan Tee Head, Non-Ionising Radiation Dosimetry Dr Phua Tan Tee Head, Nuclear Safety & Emergency Planning Tay Yong Heng Head, Services & Consultancy Tay Yong Heng CENTRE FOR TRANSFUSION MEDICINE Director A/Prof Patrick Tan Deputy Director Dr Diana Teo Head, Laboratories Dr Diana TeoHead, Blood Resources Dr Tan Hwee Huang Head, Clinical Service Dr Lai Hock Choong Nursing Administrator Mrs Chua Chye Leng Laboratory Manager Ng Kok Quan CENTRE FOR FORENSIC MEDICINE Director Dr Paul Chui Deputy Director Dr Gilbert Lau Head, Operations Dr Teo Eng Swee Principal Consultant Forensic Pathologist Dr Wee Keng Poh CENTRE FOR FORENSIC SCIENCE Director Dr Chow Shui Tse Head, Criminalistics Laboratory Dr Michael Tay Head, DNA Database Laboratory Mrs Tan Wai Fun Head, DNA Profiling Laboratory Mrs Tan Wai Fun Head, Document Examination Laboratory Ms Lee Gek KweeHead, Narcotics I Laboratory Dr Lee Tong Kooi Head, Narcotics II Laboratory Dr Lee Tong Kooi Head, Toxicology Laboratory Dr Danny Lo CENTRE FOR ANALYTICAL SCIENCE Director Chua Teck Hock Deputy Director Wong Yew Sin Head, Food Laboratory Ms Joanne Chan Head, Pharmaceutical Laboratory Dr Bosco Chen Bloodworth Head, Industrial Health Laboratory Dr Woo Soo On Head, Cosmetics Laboratory Mrs Wong Geok Eng Head, Cigarette Testing Laboratory Dr Chow Yue Thong Head, Environmental Laboratory Ng Soon Head, Customs Laboratory Tan Poo Hua Head, Research & Development Ong Eng ShiCopyright\u00a9HSA E07-02/R00 CMG Aug 02.
