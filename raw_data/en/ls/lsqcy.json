Important Numbers Life West At a Glance 600 Students enrolled 11:1 Student-to-staff ratio 12-14 Quarters Typical graduation timeline $167,278 Average salary for California chiropractors (Dec. 2019, Salary.com) Clinically Inspired Learning A robust mix of Clinical Experience and Academics Traditionally, chiropractic students take a sequential path \u2014 spending the first half (or more) of the program in a strictly academic classroom environment before transitioning to more hands-on, clinical experiences. At Life West, immersing students in the clinical component of the curriculum happens in parallel with academic studies, enabling students to learn the practical application of their work in tandem with their classroom studies. Life West students begin getting hands-on experience significantly earlier than any other program and graduate with many more hours of clinical experience \u2014 offering a huge advantage for knowledge retention and being truly confident and prepared for a post-graduation transition to a Doctor of Chiropractic. [What is Clinically-Inspired Learning and Why Does it Matter?](https://lifewest.edu/academics/clinically-inspired-learning/) Why Life West? Producing results with a chance to save on your tuition Life West is a non-profit school. While there's no such thing as an inexpensive doctoral degree, Life West is extremely proud of a track record of creating practice-ready chiropractors while simultaneously delivering a program designed to help our students save on the cost of education. A flat quarterly tuition rate Life West students pay a flat quarterly tuition rate, which provides two core benefits: - Students may explore techniques and specialties that interest them through elective courses without incurring additional debt. - Students can choose an accelerated 12-quarter program to save a full two quarters in tuition costs. Preceptorships where you want to live As part of our curriculum, students are encouraged to complete their final quarter(s) in preceptorships outside of the college, moving the academic portion of their chiropractic education online. While not a direct tuition savings, this means students may find a preceptorship where ever they'd like. Students can leverage this opportunity to focus on a specialization, work with a preferred mentor doctor, work abroad or simply find a location with a low cost of living. Our Philosophy Give. Do. Love. Serve. Invaluable experience and an opportunity to change lives A guiding principle that you'll hear early and often at Life West: \"Give, do, love, serve \u2014 from a place of abundance.\" Life West graduates are poised to enjoy long, successful and profitable careers as Doctors of Chiropractic. We hope to root that success in the mindset of giving back and paying forward. Life West operates serveral global service initiatives including ongoing service trips to India, Tonga and Panama, as well as here at home in the San Francisco Bay Area. We've teamed up with companies in the chiropractic community to help sponsor these trips. That means students are able to join the service trips for a heavily subsidized and very reasonable cost.
