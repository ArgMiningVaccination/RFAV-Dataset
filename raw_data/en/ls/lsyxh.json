Two doses of either [vaccine]within 180 days offered a low [effectiveness]against COVID-19 of all [4.2-44.5], CoronaVac 22.9% [1.3-39.7]), decreased after 180 days. Two doses of CoronaVac were poorly protective 39.5% [4.9-62.5] against severe [diseases]for age 60 years, but the [effectiveness]increased substantially after the third [dose](79.1% [25.7-96.7]). Two doses of [BNT162b2]protected age 60 years against severe [diseases](79.3% [47.2, 93.9]); however, the uptake was not high enough to assess three doses.
