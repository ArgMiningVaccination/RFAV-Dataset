Packed with amino acids, this daily nutritional supplement fuels the growth of healthy cells in the heart, brain, and immune system. Primary Benefits Inspire is a life-giving action. InspiraCell (inspire-a-cell) provides the body with nutrients that fuel the growth and replication of healthy cells, especially those of the heart, brain, and immune system. This intricate formula was originally designed to provide the nourishment for the restorative balance needed by those bodies overwhelmed with complex physical illnesses and/or mental and emotional disorders. Trauma, emotions, and toxins can hold the heart and brain in an energetic and/or chemical bondage. This may trigger the immune system to work overtime, which in turn creates a multitude of disturbing symptoms and syndromes. InspiraCell supports the restoration of the brain and heart's vital cellular communication; this allows the immune system to return to balance. Amino acids in InspiraCell carry oxygen throughout the body. They are also the building blocks for neurotransmitters that carry messages in the brain. This promotes growth, cellular replication, optimal memory, learning, and brain function. Other primary ingredients support the heart, liver, kidneys, adrenals, and immune system for optimal health. Amino acids: Without the building blocks of protein, life is not possible. Amino acids carry oxygen throughout the body; they are necessary for growth, cellular replication, and communication between nerve cells by means of neurotransmitters, which are imperative for optimal memory, learning, and brain function. GABA is a neurotransmitter important for brain function. Antioxidants: Gamma oryzanol (from rice), alpha lipoic acid, and beetroot are used by the body to remove free radicals that cause cell damage. Alpha lipoic acid dissolves toxic substances in the liver. Beetroot supports the immune system, contains easy-to-assimilate iron, aids digestion, and has properties that are used to clean the kidneys and gallbladder. CoQ10 helps cells generate energy. The heart, liver, and kidneys require the most energy; they store CoQ10 to meet their energy demands. Smoking, alcohol, stress, aging, chronic illness, beta-blockers, and cholesterol-lowering drugs deplete CoQ10 stores in the body. Herbs: Hawthorne berries, the \"top herb for the heart\", are considered by herbalists as the \"safest of all herbal supplements.\" Acerola berry supports the immune system as it is rich in vitamin C and easily absorbed. It also contains vitamin A, B vitamins, carotenoids, and bioflavonoids. Hyaluronic acid is naturally found in fluids of the eyes, joints, and spaces of skin tissue. Studies focus on the role it plays within the arteries of the circulatory system, the immune system, and the formation of new body tissue. Vitamins: B vitamins help maintain a healthy heart, which in turn promotes healthy circulation, blood pressure, and the entire body. InspiraCell also contains vitamins that support the nervous system, immune system, and skin with folic acid, biotin, pantothenic acid, vitamin C, vitamin D3, "}
