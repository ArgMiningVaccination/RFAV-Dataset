Issues Concerning Homeoprophylaxis Prof. George Vithoulkas1: I want to talk to you about what is called lately homeoprophylaxis and clarify certain issues con- cerning this matter. There is a general idea of the remedyArnica being used before and after an operation. Many homeopaths advise, take Arnica before operation so you don't have much bleeding and then take Arnica afterwards to stop bleeding. This is entirely wrong. Why? Because we use Arnica as a blood thinner. So if you have a clot of blood, it dissolves thisclot. When you have a blow and there is an extravasation of blood and there are bruises with areas that are becoming blue, it means that the blood has created a lot of clot, and then yougive Arnica, and like a miracle, these clots are dissolved. Why? Because Arnica is acting like Coumarin but better and faster than Coumarin, as there are no side effects. But if Arnica is thinning the blood, it means that Arnica is contraindicated before an operation because, if anything, theywill have more bleeding. You see the illogical thinking of some people and also their misinformation? Not only that. But you may get some people who say 'We had tried and researched and we have found out that Arnica helps '. How they found out that Arnica helps if they cannot measure the bleeding before and without Arnica and the bleeding after Arnica? But it is a fact that when you have a heart attack because of a blood clot, then the rst remedy they may think to give is Arnica. Do you understand the misunderstandings that have taken place in the teaching of different schools? Now the Times of London w r o t ea na r t i c l ei nw h i c ht h e ys a i d , 'Homeopathy is a voodoo medicine '. Why? The journalist wrote, 'Listen to this: homeopaths claim that they can give a remedy as aprophylactic to the different epidemic diseases '. From where did he have such information? Because some homeopaths havewritten books, articles, etc. saying we have the possibility to give a remedy as a prophylaxis. That was taken to mean 'Ig i v e you a remedy and if an epidemic comes, like chicken pox orrubella or whooping cough, you are protected '.D oy o ub e l i e v e you are protected? Of course not, and then the Times is right when saying this is 'voodoo medicine '. What is your reason for believing that giving a remedy \u2014let us say Thuja or whatever, Morbillinum etc. \u2014that it will protect you when the epidemic will come after a year or two? Then the argument from some homeopaths is, 'but Hah- nemann said that when there was an epidemic of scarlet fever during that time he gave Belladonna as a prophylactic so thepeople would be protected from scarlet fever '. See now, the misunderstanding of what Hahnemann said and how this has been misinterpreted and presented as a possibility for prophylaxis. Hahnemann saw that a lot of people who were getting scarlet fever needed Belladonna as a remedy. So he thought, why not give Belladonna to everybody so that we may have less casualties. He thought he was doing a prophylaxis. What hewas doing was giving a remedy in the beginning of the scarlet fever so this fever would not develop fully. It was like giving the right remedy in the very beginning of the disease and this wasa curative action, not a prophylactic one in the meaning we have today for vaccinations and prophylaxis. During the epidemic, the genius of the epidemic \u2014that means the remedy that was indicated in most of the cases \u2014will act as a curative remedy. This is totally different from saying that we will give you a remedy and you will be protected from differentepidemics like smallpox, chickenpox, mumps, scarlet fever etc. The homeopathic remedy will act only if the symptoms are similar to the remedy. If the symptoms of the organism areKeywords homeoprophylaxis vaccinationAbstract This article is a transcript of a lecture on homeoprophylaxis given by Professor Vithoulkas at the International Academy of Classical Homeopathy, Alonissos, whichhe kindly edited and agreed to be reproduced for this issue of Homeopathic Links.

It will have no effect. On the rst situation, when the symptoms are similar, the remedy will cure because it ts on an organism that is already starting to become sick with symp- toms of Belladonna. In the case where you give the remedy toa healthy individual outside of an epidemic and expect it to act when the epidemic will manifest after months or years, this is totally wrong and there will be no effect. So how can one maintain that, by giving you a remedy today, the next year when the epidemic will come, you will be protected? If you want to try to protect while the epidemic is there, then nd, after your 10 rst cases, which is the genius epidemicus and if there is such a remedy running throughthe cases, try to give this in the beginning of the epidemic and record the effects in a detailed manner and with objectivity. In my book, The Science of Homeopathy , 2there is a chapter on vaccination. I have written this book in 1976 and still these ideas are valid to a great extent. During that time, I made a full analysis of who is going to be protected and how he is going tobe protected. I let you read it, but now I can say only this: If a person is really protected by conventional vaccinations, that means the vaccination caused his immune system to becompromised and therefore this speci ce p i d e m i cc a n n o t affect him according to my theory 'Levels of Health '. What I want you to understand is that homeopathy cannot make you so sick with a remedy that you will never get the epidemic. This is a mechanism, a simple mechanism. Can we, with homeopathy, claim to do this? No. The only thing we canclaim is that during the epidemic we can give a common remedy for the epidemic, hoping that it will act. Where are the double-blind tests so that we could support such claims? My idea is that certain people are prone to have a big reaction with the conventional vaccination and that some will have side effects. Therefore, my idea is, before you vaccinate, you should nd out the sensitivities of the immune system and detect the children who, if vaccinated, could develop dangerous side effects. To do this, they can start today evaluating the immune system of the children before and after the vaccinations tond the differences and the parameters that made a child enter a pathologic state. The argument is 'but they live longer now '. Yes, they live longer. But what is the quality of life that they will have? We don 't want to vaccinate until we will nd out if the child can be safely vaccinated. Once the child is sick, you treatthe child. The argument is 'but the poliomyelitis was killing a lot of people and paralysed them '. Yes, but they did not have homeopathy. They did not have any means to ght. But this is not homeoprophylaxis. It is homeocuring. It is curing with homeopathy. We have to nd out whether a child would be vaccinated and not have a dramatic effect on his health.There are certain signs that we can observe in a child, and if a child has these signs, he/she should be excluded. There are some signs that we can nd out if we really do research in this. Today genetics have progressed quite a lot. For example, if in the DNA you nd a predisposition for a neuromuscular disorder, you must say this child should not take poliovaccination. Today we have the technology to take such measures. Behind all this is the fear of death. Behind all this is our fear of dying. Why? Because we have not been educated at all on what the meaning of life is and what the meaning of death is.We don 't know. We are afraid of the unknown. I conclude that we homeopaths have no alternative to vaccinations and I think I have explained this issue properly. Now, I want to read you something very short from the British Medical Journal , June 14, 2007. Concerning the vaccine Gardasil which is given to young girls to protect them fromdeveloping cancer. The HPV vaccine which has been given to girls age 11 to 12 to prevent cervical cancer in later life may be a killer. So far, three young girls have died after been vaccinated and there have been 1,637 adverse reactions reported in less than a year. 1,637 reported, never mind the unreported. And it continues ... In Australia 25 girls at the same school who had been given their rst HPV vaccine last month experience headache, nausea, and 4 of them ended in the hospital. Otherwise there are no side effects. The vaccine continues ... It is the British Medical Journal , a prestigious medical journal, reporting this. So we have a problem with vaccinations really and we have to solve it quickly before we nd out that we have damaged deeply the human race. Editor 'sN o t e Prof. Vithoulkas and the editor (Isaac Golden) debated thistopic in 2007 over four editions of www.hpathy.com. This debate is still available to read in the Hpathy archive. 3 The very relevant issue of whether HP actually works by suppressing the immune system (like vaccines), or works only because it treats what is present during an epidemic,or actually works because it effectively treats speci c inherited weaknesses which would otherwise prevent the vital force from protecting individuals if they areexposed to the targeted diseases, is discussed in the nal chapter of the editor 's book The Complete Practitioners Manual of Homeoprophylaxi s. 4 References Science of Homeopathy.
