Classical signs include; - Energy Rushes. Sensations of energy, heat, and/or light that rise up the spine or rush up through the body towards the head. The energy may feel like a rushing, flowing, trickling, exploding, jumping, vibrating, burning, piercing, or like an electrical current. The body may physically jerk and move with the energy rushes, or in other cases become locked and rigid. - Light. Perceptions of inner light, radiating light, and/or a luminosity in the outer world; perceiving liquid light flowing up the spine into the brain; or the sensation of being engulfed or immersed in a brilliant white light. - Sound. Perception of an inner sound: often likened to the rushing of wind, the distant roar of a waterfall, the rushing of wings. May also be humming, ringing of bells, the buzzing of bees, the chirping of crickets, rumbling of a motor, or \"music of the spheres.\" - Experiences of paranormal consciousness. The above sensations are associated, ultimately, with a mystical experience, out-of-body or other psychic experience, or inspired creativity. - Unusual sexual sensations. Sometimes a kundalini awakening is associated with unusual sensations of upward moving energy activity in the genital area, or unusual sensations of sexual arousal with a possible penile erection that is not associated with sexual stimulation; rarely spontaneous orgasms that seem to be directed inward and upward rather than outward.
