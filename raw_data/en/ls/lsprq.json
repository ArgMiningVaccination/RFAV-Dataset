All faiths are welcome and supported.

The Chapel strives to be inviting, inclusive, and a safe place in which to strengthen the foundation of the community. A typical weekday service opens with prayer, followed by a short reading that reflects anything from the speaker's religious tradition to a favorite novel. Next, a student, faculty member, alumna/us, or guest delivers a Chapel talk. Whether funny, insightful, challenging, or touching, the talks provide a window to a deeper presence that daily routines sometimes obscure. The weekday service concludes with communal singing, often a hymn, sometimes followed by musical postludes performed by students. Students are required to attend a weekend service each week; they choose among the services offered that best fit their own tradition or ethos. Many students from various Christian denominations attend a Sunday service in the Episcopal tradition at St. John's Chapel. Jewish students often choose to observe a Friday evening Sabbath service; Muslim students gather in prayer and study; Hindu students gather for puja and study; Buddhist students (and many who consider themselves spiritual but not religious) find quiet time for meditation during a weekly sangha; and many Roman Catholic students attend Mass at the local parish.
