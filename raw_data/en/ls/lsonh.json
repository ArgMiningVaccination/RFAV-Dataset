Pedersen* Department of Medicine and Epidemiology, School of Veterinary Medicine, University of California, Davis, CA 95616, USA Abstract The following review is based on notes used in the teaching of clinical immunology to veterinary students. Immune diseases of the dog are placed into six different categories: (1) type I or allergic conditions; (2) type II or auto- and allo-antibody diseases; (3) type III or immune complexdisorders; (4) type IV or cell-mediated immune diseases; (5) type V conditions or gammopathies;and (6) type VI or immunodeficiency disorders.

Introduction Immune diseases have been classified in several different ways, but for the sake of the following review, they will be categorized according to their basic pathogenesis. Sixdistinct categories can be constructed, the first four being originally described by Gel andCoombs (Types I-IV reactions) (Coombs and Gell, 1975), and the last two (Types V andVI) being added by the author. These six categories include: 1. Type I diseases mediated by homocytotropic antibodies and typified by immediate- type hypersensitivity, i.e., allergies; 2. Type II diseases mediated by auto- or allo-reactive antibodies;3. Type III diseases mediated by immune complex deposition and characterized by vasculitis; 4. Type IV diseases mediated by cell-mediated immune reactions and manifested by plasmacytic/lymphocytic infiltrates; 5. Type V diseases manifested by gammopathies; and6. Type VI diseases manifested by immunodeficiency and see front #1999 Science B.V . All rights reserved. PII: S 0165-2427(99)00059-8This classification scheme, while admittedly an oversimplification, has proven very useful in the training of veterinary students. Modifications have to be made for somedisorders, such as systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE), which has elements ofautoantibody and immune complex reactions. The immune form of amyloidosis alsodoes not clearly fit into any of the six categories, but is included with immune complexdisease, to which it bears both immunopathologic and clinical similarities. It must be stressed that immune diseases are not due to a distinct and pathologic type of immune response; rather, they are the result of normal types of immune responses that occur in a dysregulated fashion, for an excess duration, in an abnormal location, oragainst antigens that are not normally considered to be foreign. Type I (allergic) diseasesare associated with the IgE system, which is one of the primary defenses against parasiteattacks. Type II (auto- and allo-antibody reactions) involve the formation of antibodiesthat react against self-antigens. Type III reactions involve the deposition and clearance ofimmune complexes, which are essential features of normal immune responses. Type IVdiseases involve cellular immunity, which is the most important immune defense against pathogens or pathogenic states involving cells. Type V diseases involve excessive production of immunoglobulins or parts of immunoglobulins, while Type VI diseasesoccur when something impedes normal immune defense mechanisms, either innate oradaptive. There are six general factors that underlie most immune diseases of dogs. The foremost is genetic susceptibility. About 60% of dogs are now purebred, and purebreeding alwaysinvolves inbreeding. Because of the great diversity of immune mechanisms, and hence thegenetic complexity of its development and regulation, it is understandable how inbreeding can result in a spectrum of disorders ranging from dysregulation of the immune system and autoimmunity at one extreme to cancers at the other. Although it maybe oversimplistic, the susceptibility to autoimmune diseases is thought to be controlled bythe interplay of environmental and heritable factors; the latter involving genes of themajor histocompatibility complex (MHC) (Campbell and Milner, 1993). The gender of the dog is the second most common cofactor (Quimby et al., 1980); intact females have the highest incidence of immune diseases and intact males the lowest,as has been observed in humans. The gender bias is not nearly as obvious with widespread spaying and castration. Ovariohysterectomy reduces the incidence, while castration increases the incidence, thus tending to equalize gender effects in neuteredanimals. The third most common factor underlying immune diseases is the presence of other immunologic disorders. If a certain breed or bloodline of dogs suffers from oneimmune disease, they will also have an increased incidence of a wide range ofother immunologic disorders, as demonstrated in a study of the Old English sheepdog(Day and Penhale, 1992). Plasmacytic/lymphocytic thyroiditis and hypothyroidism is a common occurrence among dogs that develop other types of immune diseases. Dogs with systemic lupus erythematosus may also present with autoantibody associatedcytopenias. The fourth most common cofactor is infectious diseases. Infections can trigger allergies, the formation of autoantibodies (Adachi et al., 1992), immune complexdiseases, cell-mediated pathologies, immunodeficiencies.252 N.C. Pedersen / Veterinary Immunology and Immunopathology 69 (1999) 251-342The fifth most common factor underlying immunologic diseases in dogs is drugs. Drugs, including biologics, especially when given to dogs with certain geneticpredispositions, can trigger a variety of immune reactions (Cribb, 1989; Giger et al.,1985; Grondalen, 1987; Harvey, 1987). The sixth most common factor associated with immune disease is cancer (Day, 1996a, b, c). Cancers frequently arise from cells of the immune system or affect the immunesystem through paraneoplastic effects. 2. Type I (allergic) diseases 2.1. Mechanisms of type I (allergic) disorders of the dog Type I diseases are mediated by immediate-type hypersensitivity responses occurring in one or more target tissues. Immediate-type hypersensitivity reactions are mediatedmainly by IgE, and to a lesser extent IgG, antibodies. IgA and IgM antibodies are onlyoccasionally involved. Antibodies that participate in this reaction have the ability tosensitize cells, in particular mast cells and basophils. Sensitization is a process whereby specific cytotropic antibodies bind to the cell membrane. The binding of the corresponding antigen to these membrane bound antibody molecules triggers the allergicreaction. The cytotropic antibody system plays an important role in normal immune responses, particularly against parasites. It is somewhat analogous to the secretory (IgA, IgM)antibody system. It is localized to areas of the body where parasites are most apt to gainaccess or traverse, i.e., in the skin, mucous membranes of the GI and respiratory tracts, inthe bloodstream, and around blood vessels in the porto-mesenteric system. The beneficial nature of this response is important to keep in mind; many people believe that cytotropic antibodies and immediate-type hypersensitivity reactions are only of nuisance value. Antibodies that participate in type I reactions are either homo- or hetro-cytotropic. Homocytotropic antibodies will sensitize animals of the same species but not otherspecies. Homocytotropic antibodies are usually of the IgE class in all animals tested.Heterocytotropic antibodies are usually of the IgG, IgM, or IgA class and will sensitizecells of other species as well. Cytotropic antibodies have an extremely high avidity for receptors on the membranes of mast cells. Within 3-72 h of their formation, they bind by their Fc portion to mast cells. IgG (and IgA and IgM) cytotropic antibodies have a short life span on the mast cellmembrane (12-24 h), while IgE antibodies remain strongly attached for three to sixweeks. Cytotropic antibodies are produced in lymphoid tissues underlying the mucousmembranes of the body (Peyer's patches, tonsils, diffuse lymphoid aggregates). Antigens that elicit specific cytotropic antibody responses are called allergens (Marsh and Norman, 1988). Allergens generally have a molecular weight restricted to 10 000-70 000 Da. Substances <10 000 Da are not sufficiently large to bridge two adjacent membrane bound molecules of cytotropic antibody, while larger allergens will not penetrate the mucous membranes. Allergens are highly polar substances containing manysulfhydryl groups and will sensitize in nanogram to microgram amounts. Besides theirN.C. Pedersen / Veterinary Immunology and Immunopathology 69 (1999) 251-342 253size and chemical makeup, allergens that elicit IgE responses are often taken up by the host at low dosage and across some mucosal surface (Marsh and Norman, 1988).Allergens can be parts of parasites, such as house dust mites or cockroaches. Conditionswhich allow an excessive build-up of these insects in the environment will also increasethe exposure level to their allergens. Many allergens resemble proteinaceous substanceson the cuticle of parasites (e.g., pollen, mold spores, dander). Drugs, cosmetics, andsubstances in cigarette smoke may also act as allergens. The target cells of allergic reactions are the tissue mast cells and circulating basophils. There are approximately 7000-20,000 mast cells per ml of skin or intestinal tissue. Mast cells and basophils possess cytoplasmic granules that contain potent inflammatorymediators as reacting contain substances that havereparative functions such as chymase, hyaluronic acid chemotactic factors. is not single a mixture of spasmogenic and vasodilatory metabolites of arachidonic acid called leukotrienes. SRA-A is also not a sole product of mast cells, but a contribution from both mast cells and other activated tissue mononuclear cells. Basophils are probablya circulating form of mast cell, although they differ in their responses to certainsubstances; cromolyn sodium inhibits release of mast cell granules but not basophilgranules. The release of mast cell or basophil granular contents is triggered by the binding of allergen to specific cytotropic antibodies on the cell surface. Binding of one molecule ofallergen to two adjacent molecules of specific cytotropic antibody alters in the cell membrane and initiates energy dependent processes that culminate in the release of the pharmacologic mediators of the allergic response. In any given individual, the degree ofsensitivity is directly proportional to the amount of histamine released by mast cells orcirculating basophils in response to a standard amount of a particular allergen. The IgE system is under strong T-cell regulation (Romagnani, 1994), and there is an inverse relationship between cellular and IgE immunity. IgE production is enhanced bythymectomy, sublethal whole body irradiation, anti-thymocyte serum, radiomimeticdrugs, certain viral infections, and in individuals with congenital and acquired immunodeficiency syndromes involving cellular immunity (Wiskott-Aldrich syndrome, ataxia-telangiectasia, Hodgkin's disease). The phenomenon of allergic breakthrough occurs has great clinical relevance. IgE production is minimal in normal non-allergic individuals and is kept that way by internalregulatory mechanisms involving T-lymphocytes (Romagnani, 1994). Natural events,such as viral infections, can temporarily depress T-cell-mediated immunity and thusnormal dampening mechanisms are removed and enhanced IgE production occurs.Genetically predisposed dogs developed higher levels of specific IgE when exposed to pollen extracts several days following canine distemper immunization (Frick and Brooks, 1983). Enhanced production of cytotropic antibodies to non-parasite antigens may alsoresult from disuse of normal IgE mediated immunity. Heavily parasitized people mayhave less problems with nuisance type allergies (Buckley et al., 1985), indicating that anIgE immune system engaged in normal parasite defenses is less likely to react toperipheral or related antigens.254 N.C. Pedersen / Veterinary Immunology and Immunopathology 69 (1999) 251-342The development of allergies is also influenced by genetics (Huang and Marsh, 1993). If both parents have atopy, 75% of their children will be atopic. If one parent has atopy,the chances are 50%. Similar genetic predispositions have been seen in animals,especially among purebreds. 2.2. Specific Type I immune diseases2.2.1. Systemic anaphylaxis Anaphylaxis can be classified as systemic (anaphylactic shock, angioedema, hives) or localized (GI, skin, respiratory allergies). Systemic anaphylactic reactions are triggeredby allergens that enter the bloodstream and react with specifically sensitized mast cells inthe target organs. Systemic reactions of this type can be provoked in dogs, by routinevaccines, drugs (Phillips et al., 1998), foreign protein injections, insect bites, food stuffs,or pollens and molds. In spite of the widespread belief that anaphylactic reactions oftenescalate in severity with repeated sensitization, severe anaphylactic reactions can occur without known previous exposure and are much more likely to manifest themselves similarly following repeated elicitation than to escalate in severity. 2.2.1.1. Anaphylactic shock . Anaphylactic shock is the most severe form of systemic anaphylaxis. The target organs in dogs tends to be the porto-mesenteric system, andunlike humans, the smooth muscles of the lungs are either spared or mildly involved. Thelocal release of vasoactive amines results in porto-mesenteric or splanchnicvasodilatation, venous pooling of blood, peripheral vasocollapse, and in severe cases,death. Clinical signs include nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, ataxia, coldness and pallor ofmucous membranes, rapid breathing, and in some cases, bronchial constriction (asthmatictype breathing). Death may occur in as short as 5 min. Animals living more than 5 min may also show signs of hypersalivation, tenesmus, and defecation. Profuse salivation may 2.2.1.2. Angioneurotic edema . Angioneurotic- or facioconjunctival-edema is a less severe systemic allergic reaction manifested by swelling of the lips, eyelids, conjunctiva,and occasionally associated with mild bronchial constriction, GI signs, and mildshock. Edema reaches a peak in 10-30 min and may take several hours to subside. Thistype of reaction is evoked by the same sorts of allergens as systemic anaphylacticreactions. 2.2.1.3. Urticaria . coin-like, sharply delineated, and highly pruritic lesions of the skin that occur within minutes of allergenic exposure. They are analogous to the lesions evoked by intradermal inoculations of histamine. Hives maybe the sole manifestation of allergic reaction or may be associated with any of the abovereactions. Clinical signs generally last for 1/2 to 2 h and then subside. Most dogs will only manifest anaphylactic reactions after provocative testing (IV, IM, subcutaneous injection of suspected allergen), something which is potentially dangerousand not usually done. Fortunately, the diagnosis can usually be made from a detailedhistory.N.C. Pedersen / Veterinary Immunology and Immunopathology 69 (1999) 251-342 255The most effective control of systemic allergic reactions is to avoid re-exposure to the offending allergen. This is easily done when drugs are the offenders, because alternativeproducts are usually available that are not allergenic. However, vaccines, which are themost common cause of such reactions, are more problematic for veterinarians. Manyveterinarians believe that booster vaccinations are absolutely essential and are unwillingto forego their use even when they have previously evoked an allergic reaction. Ifsystemic allergic reactions to vaccination are life-threatening (i.e., anaphylactic shock), the risk of subsequent immunizations will far out-weigh the negligible benefits provided by booster vaccinations. The chances of an older and well-vaccinated dog gettingpotentially fatal infections like canine distemper, infectious canine hepatitis, parvovirusenteritis, leptospirosis or rabies are extremely low, and the other vaccinatable diseases,such as kennel cough, parinfluenza, Lyme borreliosis, and coronavirus enteritis are oflimited clinical relevance in the general dog population. Even concern about the legalrequirement for rabies boosters should not override common sense; a waiver can usuallybe obtained for rabies vaccinations when the use of such vaccine is life threatening. If systemic allergic reactions to vaccines are severe, but not life threatening (hives, angioneurotic edema), pretreat the animal 1 h before immunization with antihistamineand prednisolone. Give 1/10th the vaccine dose; if no adverse reaction is seen in 10-20 min, administer the remainder. Changing brands or types of vaccine will seldomprevent the problem, because most vaccines contain similar offending allergens.However, leptospirosis bacterin is the worst offender and the least essential vaccine,and can easily be left out of the vaccination regimen. 2.2.2. Localized allergic reactions of specific organ systems 2.2.2.1. Allergic respiratory diseases .Allergic rhinitis (vasomotor rhinitis) is the most common allergic disorder of people, but is infrequent in dogs. Inhalant allergens in dogs are more commonly associated with atopic dermatitis than with rhinitis, while theopposite is true for people. This might reflect a difference in distribution of sensitizedmast cells in the two species. It is caused by inhalation of pollen, danders, dusts andmolds, cosmetics, cigarette smoke, and miscellaneous inhalants. Clinical signs may beseasonal in the case of seasonal allergens, or year around. Sneezing and snuffling (reverse sneezing) are the most common presenting clinical signs of allergic rhinitis. Signs are usually seasonal and last for a few weeks. During the allergic period the clinical signs are usually intermittent rather than persistent. Nasal discharge is scant and usually serous in nature. In severe cases, however, sneezing andnasal discharge can be pronounced. Conjunctivitis, with reddening of the eyes and serousocular discharge, is an uncommon accompanying feature. Before making a diagnosis of allergic rhinitis in a dog, it is important to rule out other causes of chronic rhinitis. Nasal mites, if undetected, can present in an identical manner,and indeed, only those dogs that become allergic to their nasal mites will show clinicalsigns of infestation. Nasal aspergillosis may present with sneezing. Neoplasia of the nasal passages, which is relatively common in older dogs, may present initially as sneezing. Foreign bodies, especially grass awns, occur in both dogs and cats and are associated with256 N.C. Pedersen / Veterinary Immunology and Immunopathology 69 (1999) 251-342violent sneezing in the initial stages and purulent unilateral nasal discharge in the later stages. Complete blood counts and other routine laboratory tests will usually be normal in dogs with allergic rhinitis. Intradermal allergen testing is of variable benefit indetermining either the allergic nature of the rhinitis or the specific allergen or allergensinvolved. Diagnosis is usually made by ruling out other causes, finding eosinophils in thenasal wash, and response to hospitalization or other changes in the environment. Response to glucocorticoid therapy may also be helpful. The preferred treatment for allergic rhinitis is to find the cause of the allergy and remove the allergen from the environment. If this is not possible, treat withglucocorticoids using an every-other-day maintenance therapy at the lowest effectivedose and limit treatment to periods when disease signs are present. Allergic Bronchitis is the most common allergic condition of the respiratory tract of dogs. It is presumably due to the inhalation of the same types of substances that areassociated with allergic rhinitis. Clinical signs are usually chronic and year around, and manifested by a chronic, dry honking-type of cough. The cough is easily elicited upon tracheal compression, and is often evoked by exercise, drinking of water, excitement, orpulling on the leash. The cough is usually non-productive but occurs in paroxysms thatend with a gag or retch. Following allergic stimulation of the tracheal and bronchialmucosa, the mucosal cells secrete a thick and tenacious type of mucus. This mucus,though not copious, is very thick and tenacious and difficult for the animal to clear. Thecharacteristic cough is due to low grade irritation and from the animal's attempt to clearmucus from the airways. It is essential to differentiate this disorder from other causes of chronic bronchitis. In toy breeds, especially poodles, the collapsing trachea syndrome can produce the samesigns. To further complicate matters, allergic bronchitis and collapsing trachea syndromemay coexist. The inability of dogs with collapsing tracheas to clear foreign matter fromtheir airways may predispose them to the development of allergies in the tracheobronchialtree. Chronic bronchitis due to low grade bacterial infections is common in older dogs,especially larger sporting breeds. This is probably associated with a degeneration of thelocal mucocillary activity of the bronchial mucosa. Lung worms, foreign bodies, primary lung tumors, congestive heart failure, and disorders associated with tracheal compression should also be ruled out. Kennel cough due to various infectious agents, in particularBordetella bronchiseptica , is also an important differential diagnosis. The diagnosis of allergic bronchitis is fairly easy to make. Other causes of chronic bronchitis can usually be eliminated by the history, physical exam, and chest radiographs.Once other causes are eliminated, the diagnosis can be confirmed by analysis of thetracheal wash. The tracheal wash is usually bacterially sterile and contains numerouseosinophils. The CBC is normal, or occasionally shows a mild eosinophilia. Chest radiographs may be normal or show a mild increase in bronchial markings. It is very difficult to find the cause of the allergy or to avoid exposure. The condition is usually treated with expectorant/bronchial dilator drugs such as theophyline elixir witheither potassium glycerol guiacholate, or with glucocorticoids, or both. Mildcases will respond very well to the expectorant/bronchial dilators alone, or to low doseglucococorticoid therapy.N.C. Pedersen Immunology and Immunopathology 69 (1999) 251-342 257Eosinophilic pneumonitis is relatively common in dogs and resembles the human diseases referred to as acute eosinophilic pneumonia (Pope-Harman et al., 1996),pulmonary eosinophilias (Bain or 'pulmonary infiltrates witheosinophilia' (PIE). Pulmonary eosinophilias are a diverse group of disorders in peopleand are characterized by pulmonary infiltrates, rich in eosinophils, and peripheraleosinophilia. Known causes include fungi, especially Asperigilla fumigatus , parasites, toxins, and drugs. The causes in dogs are similar and at least twofold: (a) hypersensitivity reaction associated with the inhalation of allergens, in particular molds, or the use of certain drugs; and (b) parasite migration (occult dirofilariasis, lung worms, ascariasis inyoung animals). Idiopathic forms of pulmonary eosinophilia in humans Loffler'ssyndrome, acute and chronic eosinophilic pneumonia, hypereosinophilic syndrome,bronchochentric granulomatosis, and pulmonary eosinophilia associated with vasculitis(Bain and Flower, 1996). Most of these idiopathic forms also occur in dogs, but areuncommon. Clinical signs of eosinophilic pneumonitis in dogs include fatigue, exercise intolerance, soft cough, dyspnea. Chronic pulmonary can be associated with weight loss. Chest radiographs show diffuse interstitial pulmonary infiltrates around alveoli and bronchioles.Numerous eosinophils in tracheal washes and in the blood. It is important to rule outparasitic infections. Occasionally it is possible to associate the disease with environmental allergens, in which case it is best to put the animal in a new environment or alter the existingenvironment to eliminate exposure. In most cases, however, the cause is unknown andenvironment control is not feasible. Glucocorticoids for several weeks or more will cause a rapid resolution of radiographic and clinical signs. Disease will often not reoccur following treatment. Pulmonary granulomas with eosinophilia are uncommon in dogs. The cause is multifactorial and probably involves either a florid reaction in the pulmonary parenchymato dead or dying parasites, especially dirofilaria, or to idiopathic hypersensitivity angiitis.Clinical signs include a soft cough, dyspnea, fatigue and exercise intolerance, large ormultiple smaller circumscribed masses in lungs on radiographs, pronounced eosinophiliain tracheal washes and in the blood. Vascularly orientated granulomatous reaction with intense tissue eosinophilia is usually seen on biopsy. In the case of dirofilaria, dead or dying adult worms might be seen in the lesions. Glucocorticoids are effective in shrinkingmasses and improving pulmonary function. 2.2.2.2. Intestinal allergies . Intestinal allergies in dogs can be both intrinsic (food intolerance) and extrinsic (allergic) in origin (Roudebush, 1993). Although the triggering mechanism is different in extrinsic and intrinsic gastritis, both forms are ultimatelymediated by basophil degranulation and vasoactive substances, clinical signs are virtuallyidentical, and treatment is similar. Acute allergic gastritic is manifested by vomition of food within 30 min or less of eating, while allergic reactions in the upper small intestine are more apt to be manifestedby the vomiting of bile tinged mucus from 30 to 90 min or more after eating. Vomitingmay be periodic (2-3 times per week) or more constant (several times a day). Weight loss and poor hair coat are only observed in more severe cases.258 N.C. Pedersen / Veterinary Immunology and Immunopathology 69 (1999) 251-342Food allergies or intolerances affecting the small intestine are also common in dogs and manifested by intermittent or chronic diarrhea, associated with the ingestion ofcertain foods. Bowel movements are usually normal in frequency and in amount, butoften loose or watery and foul smelling. Most dogs will appear otherwise normal,although in more severe cases, the animals may be thinner than normal and the hair coatsdry and of poor quality. Eosinophilia is a variable feature, and even when present, it isseldom pronounced. Eosinophilic enteritis is a more severe and less common form of intestinal allergy. Diarrhea is more severe than in dogs with allergic enteritis, systemic signs of ill-healthmore prominent, and eosinophilia a striking finding. Allergic colitis has been described in dogs (Paterson, 1995). Stools are normal, mucous-laden, or soft. Frequency of defecation is often increased. Weight loss can be aproblem in animals with severe colitis. It is important in dogs to rule out other causes ofcolitis, e.g., whipworms, idiopathic colitis, boxer colitis, spastic colitis (mucous colitis),lymphosarcoma, etc. Dietary allergies and intolerances are so common in dogs that it is justified to try special diets before undertaking elaborate clinical work-ups. If the diarrhea is particularlysevere, fecal blood loss in the form of melena or red blood is present, weight loss ispronounced, other systemic signs are present, or if the animal is hypoproteinemic, thenthe initial diagnostic work-up should be more complete. There are no specific tests to diagnose food allergies or intolerances. Allergen testing for food allergies has not been extensively studied. In man, serum histamine levels willincrease several hours after feeding allergenic foods. A mild eosinophilia in the absence of parasites may be an additional clue. Ermel et al. (1997) were able to evoke allergic reactions directly on the mucosa of the stomach by gastroscopy, although this is notclinically applicable. The diagnosis of allergic enteritis is ultimately made by showing a response to a hypoallergenic diet. The ingredients of a hypoallergenic diet in dogs consist of foods notnormally found in their commercial diets. Cottage cheese and/or tofu and rice are goodstarting hypoallergenic diets for dogs. Fish and potato is an alternative hypoallergenicdiet (Paterson, 1995); some dogs are allergic/intolerant to milk proteins, so cottage cheese and rice may not always be appropriate. If there is no improvement with the first diet, try an alternative diet for another two weeks. If there is still no improvement, forget aboutfood allergies or intolerances and search for other causes. If there is a dramaticimprovement, add a multivitamin and mineral supplement to the diet and continue to feedit for several more weeks. After this time, new foods can be introduced one at a timeevery two weeks. If the condition is severe, or dietary control is incomplete or impossible,prednisolone is an effective, alternative treatment. 2.2.2.3. Allergic skin disease . Atopic dermatitis is prevalent in dogs and was initially attributed to allergens that were either inhaled or directly contacted the skin (pollens,molds, danders, house dust) or to insect bites (fleas). The role of dietary allergens as acause of atopic dermatitis in dogs has recently been given greater emphasis (Ermel et al., 1997; Jeffers et al., 1996; Paterson, 1995). There is a breed predisposition, especially toN.C. Pedersen / Veterinary Immunology and Immunopathology 69 (1999) 251-342 259smaller terriers (e.g., highland white), Golden retrievers, Labrador retrievers, and Dalmatians. Clinical signs include pruritic lesions about the face, feet, and axilla, often associated with self-mutilation. Intradermal allergen testing is most effective in animals showingskin manifestations associated with inhaled allergens, while dietary allergens are usuallyidentified by the use of elimination/provocation diets (Jeffers et al., 1996). Dogs are fed afood-elimination diet until clinical signs disappear, then challenged with the original diet or to single major components of the original diet (e.g., beef, chicken, eggs, milk, wheat, soy, or corn). Assays detecting allergen specific IgE in serum are increasingly being usedto diagnose allergens in dogs. Treatment should be directed whenever possible to avoiding offending allergens. Desensitization using small dosages of allergens injected parenterally is used in dogs, butthe main treatment still is glucocorticoids. 2.2.2.4. Eosinophilic encephalitis . Some dogs, ranging from puppies to adults and presenting with signs of diffuse or multifocal meningoencephalitis, will demonstrate highnumbers of eosinophils in their cerebral spinal fluid (Smith-Maxie et al., 1989). Some ofthese animals have parasitic infections in the brain on post-mortem, while many others demonstrate no obvious cause. 3. Type II immune diseases of the dogs 3.1. Mechanisms of type II immune diseases Type II reactions are characterized by the development of antibodies that react with cells or cellular constituents. The term 'cytotoxic', which was originally ascribed to thiscategory of immune diseases by Gel and Coombs, is not completely correct becauseautoantibodies are not only directed against cell surfaces, but also against cell receptors, basement membranes, basal lamina, or intracellular cement substances. The formation of self-reacting antibodies involves eight basic mechanisms: 1. anomalies of normal immunoregulation, i.e., abnormalities in self/non-self-recogni- or B-cells. Although the thymus plays an important role in eliminating clones of lymphoid cells that can react to self-antigens during early fetal development, it is evident that manyindividuals retain the capacity to react in a humoral or cellular manner against a range of260 N.C. Pedersen / Veterinary Immunology and Immunopathology 69 (1999) 251-342self-antigens. It has been said that autoantigens are not so abundant that they induce clonal deletion or anergy, but not so rare as to escape recognition entirely (Janeway andTravers, 1996). Corato et al. (1997) concluded that normal dogs had auto-erythrocytereactive lymphocytes, but that these lymphocytes must be primed in individuals withAIHA or a heritable susceptibility to the disease. Therefore, the capacity to generate self-reactive immunity appears to be suppressed by the normal immune system. The T-cellsystem is particularly involved in down-regulating autoantibody production by B-cells, and when antibodies against a particular self-antigen are generated, some aspect of T-cell regulation must have failed. Normal T-cell regulatory function can be influenced by anumber of conditions, including microbial (especially viral) infections, vaccines(McAnulty and Rudd, 1985), diseases of the lymphoreticular system such aslymphosarcoma, certain drugs, genetic weaknesses resulting in instabilities in self/non-self-recognition, and unrecognized factors. Alloantibody formation is a second way that self-reacting antibodies can be produced, usually applies to the immunization of mothers to paternally inherited antigens of the fetus, in particular RBC antigens. Sensitization of the mother can occur during pregnancy when fetal blood leaks into the maternal circulation, or at the time of parturition when thematernal-fetal attachments break down. If the mother is immunized against red cellantigens common only to the fetus, cytotoxic antibodies will be passed to the fetus in thecolostrum and a condition known as neonatal isoerythrolysis will occur. Sensitization toallogeneic RBCs can also occur as a result of prior blood transfusions from dogs withdifferent RBC types. Lymphoid cells that are programmed to react against deeply sequestered (i.e., hidden) antigens may escape destruction during the fetal development of the immune system. Indeed, many body proteins are antigenic but are not recognized as such because they aresequestered from the host's immune system (Streilein, 1993). There is also evidence thatnatural autoantibodies exist to deeply sequestered red cell membrane proteins (e.g.,spectrin) in dogs (Barker and Elson, 1993; Barker et al., 1991), and that these antibodiesmay help in the destruction of aged and worn red cells. Thyroglobulin is immunogenic ifit is injected into other areas of the body, and anti-thyroglobulin antibodies are oftensecondarily associated with primary destructive diseases of the thyroid gland in dog and humans. Following myocardial infarction or hepatic necrosis in humans, antibodies to cardiac muscle, microsomes, and other cellular constituents appear transiently in theserum. Anti-nuclear antibodies (ANA) often appear in the serum of dogs with auralhematomas, and these antibodies probably result form the extravasation and destructionof blood cells (and thus release of sequestered nuclear antigens) into the ear tissues. Inthese examples, the autoantibodies may be markers of disease (as in hypothyroidism indogs) and of no clinical significance. The autoantibodies cannot react with antigens thatare sequestered deep within the cells. In other cases, however, autoantibodies that are generated in this manner may actually have a pathogenic effect. Brucella canis infection often localizes in the testicles of dogs and can induce an autoantibody reaction to spermand infertility (George and Carmichael, 1984; Serikawa et al., 1984). Immunoglobulin focusing can occur when certain antigens are arrayed on the surfaces of cells. In the case of certain bacterial, protozoal, rickettsial, and viral diseases, antigensof the microorganisms are incorporated into the cell surfaces of host cells and render theN.C. Pedersen / Veterinary Immunology and Immunopathology 69 (1999) 251-342 261cell membrane foreign. The exact nature of anemia in such infections is not always straightforward; erythrophagocytosis is a prominent feature of Babesia gibsoni infection (Wozniak et al., 1997) and although hemolytic activity is present in the serum, it does notappear that anemia is immune mediated in the classical sense (Onishi et al., 1993). Drugsmay also combine with cellular proteins, thus creating new antigens and rendering thecell surface a target for host immunity. Antigens present on some microorganisms may elicit antibodies that cross react with normal cellular constituents. The classic example in humans is the cross reaction between certain streptococcal antigens and self-antigens on the heart valves. Innocent bystander reactions occur when circulating immune complexes are adsorbed unto RBCs, WBCs or platelets. Coated cells are then cleared by the phagocytic system.Non-specific immunoglobulin binding is a somewhat similar reaction. Some drugs, inparticular cephalosporins, can damage RBC membranes allowing for the non-specificadherence of immunoglobulins and complement. Lymphoid or plasma cell tumors can sometimes produce monoclonal autoantibodies that react with self-antigens, although this situation is admittedly rare. The likelihood of a malignant B-cell producing an antibody reactive to a self rather than non-self-antigen isvery low and the likelihood of an autoantibody being pathogenic would further reduce theodds. A German shepherd dog with malignant myeloma and a polyneuropathy may besuch an incident (Villiers hemolytic anemia and secondary forms. Idiopathic IHA is not associated with any known existing cause, while secondary IHA is usually associatedwith infectious diseases, drugs, or neoplasia. In man and cats, two-thirds or more of thecases of IHA and ITP are secondary in nature. However, most cases of IHA in dogs are'idiopathic'. In a study of 14 dogs with IHA, only three subsequently manifestedunderlying disorders (one dog developed SLE, one generalized lymphoma, and one anunidentified thromboembolic disorder) (Day, 1996a, b, c, 1998). Autoantibodies are usually produced against erythrocyte membrane antigens. In precipitation studies in dogs, antigens were either cell surface associated (glycophorin-like peptides of 29-42 kDa, unknown cytoskeleton (Barker et al., 1991). IHA can be classified in two ways. In human medicine, where much more is known about the diverse causes of these disorders, the classification is as follows: IMMUNE-MEDIATED HEMOLYTIC ANEMIA Warm antibody types Idiopathic warm IHASecondary warm IHA Associated with SLE and other autoimmune disordersAssociated with lymphoreticular malignanciesAssociated with viral infections262 N.C. Pedersen / Veterinary Immunology and Immunopathology 69 (1999) 251-342Cold antibody types Idiopathic agglutinin disease with infectionsAssociated cold hemoglobinuria Idiopathic Associated with syphilis or viral infectionsAlthough this type of classification also applies to veterinary medicine, the tendency has been to lump all immune-mediated hemolytic anemias into a single group. This is unfortunate because in one study of 42 cases of Coomb's or agglutination positivehemolytic disease in dogs, a wide spectrum of conditions were evident (Klag et al., 1993).About three-fourths of dogs were Coomb's antibody was observed in two-thirds, hemoglobinemia moderate to severe <30% hadmild reticulocytosis, and over one-third had a non-responsive anemia at the time ofdiagnosis. Concomitant thrombocytopenia was seen in two-thirds of the dogs. The mortality also varied greatly; 29% died during hospitalization and the risk of death was significantly increased in animals without marked reticulocytosis, lower PCVs, andgreatest elevations in serum bilirubin. It is obvious from these findings that there are anumber of different forms of IHA. Therefore, it is preferable at our stage of knowledge toclassify IHA in animals in more clinical terms, e.g. peracute/acute, subacute, chronic. Itmust be recognized, however, that within each of these clinical groups that some of thecases are secondary, some idiopathic, some are drug induced, and that either warm orcold may be involved. 3.2.1.1. Peracute IHA . Peracute IHA occurs more commonly in larger dogs of the shepherd type and in animals from 2 to 6 years of age. This form of IHA probably represents the (10-29%) subgroup of dogs described by Klag et al. (1993), which had thehighest mortality and associated non-responsive anemia, lowest PCVs, and highest serumbilirubin levels. The etiology of the disease is unknown. Some event, perhaps asubclinical viral or bacterial infection, triggers the rapid development of a high-titered,broadly reactive, hemagglutinin. A similar non-immune type of peracute hemolyticanemia has been observed rarely in dogs and commonly in cats with overwhelming gram-negative bacterial sepsis. The serum hemagglutinin in peracute IHA often reacts against red cells from virtually any canine donor and commonly crosses species lines to agglutinate human, cow, cat, goat, sheep and horse cells. The disorder has no precisehuman counterpart, but aspects of the canine disease resemble microangiopathic-typehemolytic disorders of man. Dogs with peracute IHA often manifest malaise, lethargy, and sometimes fever for 1-3 days prior to the actual hemolytic episode. At the time of hospitalization, the dogs areobviously depressed, the PCVs range from slightly depressed to 15% or so, andN.C. Pedersen / Veterinary Immunology and Immunopathology 69 (1999) 251-342 263hemoglobinuria (port wine urine) is observed in 10% or less of the animals. The packed cell volume will usually drop to levels below 10% within 24-72 h of the time ofadmission, and the urine and serum will often become increasingly icteric in appearance.Thromboembolic phenomena frequently accompany the peracute anemia and may beclinically manifested by neurologic (vestibular abnormalities, blindness, dementia),cardiopulmonary (respiratory distress, arrhythmias), or renal signs (elevated BUN). The characteristic feature of this disorder is the presence of 'in-tube' or 'in-saline' red cell agglutination, severe non-responsive anemia (at the time of initial hospitalization), variable thrombocytopenia, negative direct Coomb's test for IgM, IgG, and C3, andlaboratory evidence of (variable threelevels, consumptive-type thrombocytopenia).The spontaneous agglutination of the RBCsdoes not disappear when the blood is diluted 1 : 4 or more with saline, hence the term 'in-saline agglutination' or 'in-saline agglutinins'. It is extremely difficult in most cases tofind compatible blood due to the very high titers of broadly cross-reacting agglutinins.Because a small proportion of animals with similar signs are septic, blood cultures should be a routine part of the clinical work-up. Affected dogs should be immediately heparinized and aspirinized to treat the DIC and the associated microangioipathic anemia, thrombocytopenia, and thromboembolicphenomena. The production of in-saline agglutinins should be halted with immediateglucocorticoid and cyclophosphamide therapy. Incompatible transfusions should beavoided if at all possible. If it becomes necessary to transfuse, utilize the leastincompatible blood, make sure that the dog is fully heparinized prior to transfusion, andgive the blood slowly over several hours. If any untoward transfusion signs are noticed, i.e., hemoglobinemia, hemoglobinuria, facial edema, or cardiac problems, immediately discontinue the transfusion. Giving incompatible blood to a non-heparinized dog iscounter-indicated because it will greatly enhance the DIC, thromboembolic phenomena,and the microangiopathic red cell destruction. Dogs can tolerate PCVs of 10 or so,providing they are resting comfortably and their hearts are functioning normally. Gradualimprovement will occur beginning 48-96 h after treatment is started. This will be firstmanifested by an improvement in the outward demeanor of the animal and a stabilizationof the PCV. The PCV will then rise slowly to levels of 15-20 over the next week or so, the platelet count will return to normal, and autoagglutination will subside. Full restoration of the PCV can take 1-3 months. Heparinization is usually continued for 10-14 days, aspirin therapy for several months, cyclophosphamide for 2-3 weeks, and glucocorticoids for several months before beingdiscontinued. Recovered dogs do not usually have recurrent bouts of the disease. Unlikeother forms of AIHA, the prognosis of peracute disease has to be considered poor. If nottreated aggressively, almost all animals will die. A 50% or more mortality is associatedeven with optimal treatment. Whether the prognosis is grave or poor is somewhat dependent on the following negative prognostic factors: (1) hemoglobinuria; (2) no compatible donors; and (3) severity of thromboembolic signs. Also, if the dog survivesthe first three days of optimal treatment, the prognosis becomes more favorable. Therapytakes several days to take effect, and the bone marrow in these animals usually has nothad enough time to respond by the time the PCV reaches its lowest point (marrow takes aweek or so to begin to respond to acute blood loss).264 N.C. Pedersen / Veterinary Immunology is the classical or text-book form of the disease in dogs, i.e., a Coomb's positive, responsive anemia, with spherocytosis (Day, 1996a, b, c,1998). Subacute IHA accounts for two-thirds or more of hemolytic anemias in thespecies; it occurs much more often in purebreds than mongrels and disproportionately inCocker Spaniels compared to other breeds. Clinical signs occur over a period of 7-14 days or more, usually when the levels of RBC bound antibodies and complement reach sufficient density for the spleen to remove them from the circulation. Intravascular hemolysis is uncommon. Owners are usually not aware of any clinical problems until the hematocrit decreases to a mean of 17.6% (Day,1996a, b, c). At this point, lethargy, fatigue on exercise, pallor and tachypnea aremanifested. Affected animals may show generalized lymphadenopathy, pallor of themucous membranes, and hepatosplenomegaly upon physical examination. Icterus andbilirubinuria are seen in 10% or so of the cases. The anemia of subacute IHA is very responsive, with increased MCV, reticulocytosis, and polychromasia. Spherocytes are usually evident on blood smears. Spherocytes are damaged RBCs that have imbibed fluid and become spherical rather than disc-shaped. The WBC count is often elevated, occasionally with a left shift to metamyelocytes. Thisflamboyant leukocyte response is a 'slop-over' from the intense erythropoiesis and maybe mistaken for granulocytic leukemia in some cases. In order of prevalence, Coomb'sreactivity is usually associated with IgG, IgG and IgM, or IgM autoantibodies (Day,1996a, b, c); the Coomb's antibodies are warm-reactive in most cases. Cold agglutinins,when present, are of the IgM class and detectable at 4 8C. Autoantibodies in dogs with subacute IHA have been associated with glycophorins similar to those found in the human rhesus complex, unknown surface peptides, and possibly to membrane associated phospholipid (Barker et al., 1991; Barker and Elson, 1995). Dogs with subacute IHA are not in any immediate danger, so the initial treatment is usually prednisone alone (Day, 1996a, b, c). The initial dosage is 3-4 mg/kg for smalldogs and cats, 2-3 mg/kg for medium-sized dogs, and 2 mg/kg for large dogs. This doseis often divided twice daily for the first few days. The hematocrit should stabilize withinseven days and start to rise by 10 days or so. Remission in good responders is usuallyachieved within one month (Day, 1996a, b, c). If there is a poor response by week 2 of treatment, several weekly cycles of cyclophosphamide (50 mg/m 2per os daily for four consecutive days of each week) should be added to the treatment regimen. The dose of prednisone should be tapered to1 mg/kg by weeks 3-6, depending on the rate of disease remission. After the hematocrithas returned completely to normal, the prednisone dosage is halved to 1 mg/kg everyother day. It is kept at that level for 1-4 months, depending on how fast initial remissionwas achieved (the longer it takes to achieve remission, the slower therapy is withdrawn). The prognosis is good in idiopathic cases, with a mortality of <15% (Day, 1996a, b, c). Relapses are uncommon in dogs with idiopathic (primary) IHA. However, if the IHA is secondary to other problems, the long-term prognosis is poorer (Day, 1996a, b, c). 3.2.1.3. Chronic IHA . Chronic IHA is relatively uncommon compared to peracute and subacute forms. The anemia develops over weeks or months and presenting clinical signs are lethargy, fatigue, and pallor. Unlike subacute IHA, the anemia is unresponsive, almostN.C. Pedersen / Veterinary Immunology and Immunopathology 69 (1999) 251-342 265always Coomb's antibody negative, and systemic signs such as hepatosplenomegaly, lymphadenopathy and icterus are not apparent. This form of IHA is probably associatedwith autoantibodies that react with surface antigens present on red cells that are late indifferentiation, but not yet released into the circulation. This explains the absence ofCoomb's antibody positivity and spherocytosis. An indirect Coomb's test is sometimespositive when the animal's red cells are treated with bromelin, ficin or trypsin and thenincubated with its serum. Such treatment may expose more deeply situated antigens not present on circulating mature red cells but that were arrayed on the surface at an earlier stage of differentiation. As expected, the bone marrow shows either a hyper- or normal-responsive erythroid series. Multiple incompatibilities are sometimes seen on cross-matcheven though the animal may never have been transfused before. Chronic IHA has to bedifferentiated from congenital red blood cell enzyme deficiencies (heritablespherocytosis) associated 1992). Chronic IHA is treated initially with prednisolone, and if there is no response in 14-21 days, cyclophosphamide, azathioprine or leflunomide is added to the regimen. Bloodtransfusions may be necessary to sustain animal until therapy takes effect. 3.2.1.4. Cold agglutinin disease . Cold agglutinin disease is rare type of IHA, which is associated with autoantibodies that bind to the red cell surface at lower than core bodytemperatures. Cold agglutinins are usually of the IgM class and are often idiopathic inorigin. Clinical manifestations of disease are usually associated with cold exposure;therefore, dogs with cold agglutinins are most apt to be seen for the condition duringcolder weather and in colder regions. Two types of disease signs may occur: hemolyticanemia; and/or gangrene of distal extremities. Hemolytic anemia results from the binding of cold agglutinins in the cooler peripheral capillaries; although the antibodies detach when the cells return to the core of the body, complement remains bound. Gangrene ofdistal extremities results from the agglutination of red cells in smaller vessels. 3.2.1.5. Pure red cell aplasia . Pure red cell aplasia of humans occurs in two forms: (1) a congenital form; and (2) an adult acquired form. The congenital form in humans is known as Diamond-Blackfan syndrome (Dianzani et al., 1996). The syndrome is definitelyfamilial in 10% of patients and sporadic in the remainder. The adult form of pure red cellaplasia has been associated with granular lymphocyte-proliferative disorders (Yamada etal., 1997), thymoma (Masuda et al., 1997), drugs (Thompson and Gales, 1996),parvovirus B19 infection, other immune diseases (Tsai et al., 1997), development ofantibodies to either recombinantly derived or natural endogenous erythropoietin(Prabhakar and Muhlfelder, 1997), or idiopathic. Pure red blood cell aplasia in dogs is similar to the human disease; congenital and idiopathic etiologies have been observed. A congenital pure red cell aplasia occurs inpuppies from 2 to 4 months of age. Clinical signs include fatigue and extreme pallor, andin very young animals, growth may be retarded. The anemia is totally unresponsive, whileWBC and platelet counts are normal. The Coomb's test is negative, spherocytes areabsent, and like chronic AIHA, compatible donors are sometimes difficult to find. The266 N.C. Pedersen / Veterinary Immunology and Immunopathology 69 (1999) 251-342reason for this higher than normal incidence of allo-reacting antibodies is unknown. The diagnostic tip-off is the existence of a marrow aplasia that involves only one cell-line. Theaplasia may be total if the primitive RBC precursor cells are the target or there may be amaturation arrest at some later stage if more differentiated cells are the target. Thisspecificity indicates immune-mediated disease rather than toxins, myeloproliferativedisorders, etc. The treatment is identical as that for subacute or chronic IHA, except that more time must be allowed for the stem cells to be regenerated and the anemia to began to respond. Combination therapy, usually glucocorticoids and cyclophosphamide, will bring aboutremission faster than glucocorticoids alone. Affected puppies often need to be transfusedwhile waiting for therapy to take effect. The prognosis is good and recurrence is notusually seen. Adult onset pure red cell aplasia is identical to the congenital form in virtually all aspects except age at onset. About one-third of dogs given human recombinanterythropoietin will also develop anti-erthropoietin antibodies and severe pure red cell aplasia within one month or more of treatment. 3.2.2. Immune-mediated thrombocytopenia (ITP) Immune-mediated thrombocytopenia is one of the most common immunologic disorders in dogs (Feldman et al., 1988). There is a breed predilection towards poodles,and it has been associated with estrus in intact female dogs. ITP in dogs is idiopathic in75-90% of cases, but like IHA, it can be secondary to drugs (Handagama and Feldman,1986, 1988; Sullivan et al., 1992), vaccines (Elliott, 1997), Ehrlichia platys andE. canis infections (Harrus et al., 1997; Waner et al., 1995), neoplasia (Grindem et al., 1994), or to other immune diseases such as SLE or AIHA. An idiopathic asymptomatic thrombocytopenia has been described in Cavalier King Charles spaniels (Smedileet al., 1997). Anti-platelet antibodies in the serum of some affected dogs were found to react with membrane antigens GP IIb and/or IIIa, similar to the situation in humans (Lewis andMeyers, 1996). Platelet antibodies in serum or eluted from platelet membranes werefound to react with homologous platelets in 58% of the cases (Lewis and Meyers, 1996). The most frequent presenting clinical signs are petechial and ecchymotic hemorrhages of the skin and mucous membranes. during or after clipping. melena, hematuria, hyphema, and even neurological signs, may beseen in severe cases. There can be substantial blood loss and anemia in dogs with severeITP, and it may be difficult to determine whether the primary problem is ITP withsecondary hemorrhage, concurrent ITP and IMHA, or blood loss from some other sourceand DIC. The critical laboratory finding is a thrombocytopenia, usually below 60 000 platelets/ ul. Anemia, often responsive, accompanies cases that have either IHA or excessive blood loss. Platelets in the blood are often large and bizarre shaped. Megakaryocytes in bone marrow are normal in numbers or increased in 90% or more of cases. Althoughmegakaryocytes may be present in normal or increased numbers, they often appearimmature, fragmented, or fragile. Megakaryocytes are severely decreased or even absentin <10% of cases; such a finding is suggestive of 'pure megakaryocytic aplasia'.N.C. Pedersen / Veterinary Immunology Immunopathology 69 251-342 267Clotting tests, including PT, PTT, ACT, and FDPs are normal. Anti-platelet antibodies, as determined by platelet factor-3 release test are present in 70% or less of the cases. Afluorescent antibody test for antiplatelet antibodies can be done on bone marrow smears,providing megakaryocytes are present; it is about 40% sensitive (Kristensen et al., 1994a,b). An indirect platelet immunoflourescence test appears to have a higher sensitivity(70%) (Kristensen et al., 1994a, b). Adaptation of the latter test to flow cytometry did notimprove the sensitivity. Using sensitive binding tests, platelet bound antibodies were found in over 90% of affected dogs and serum anti-platelet antibodies in 34% (Lewis and Meyers, 1996; Lewis et al., 1995). Because of the relative insensitivities of anti-plateletantibody tests the diagnosis of ITP is usually made on clinical appearance and response totherapy. Care must be taken to rule out secondary causes of ITP or of thrombocytopenia. There are two main findings that influence the mode of therapy: (1) the presence or absence of megakaryocytes; and (2) the presence and severity of associated blood loss.The absence of megakaryocytes will delay the anticipated therapeutic response for aweek or more, which can greatly effect the cost and prognosis in animals with severe ITP and blood loss. In animals with petechial and ecchymotic hemorrhages, but without serious blood loss, glucocorticoid treatment alone will usually suffice. Azathioprine orcyclophosphamide is usually added to the regimen if there is no response in 10-14 days.Thrombocytopenia associated with severe blood loss is best treated with prednisolone andvincristine, because vincristine will frequently decrease the normal response time from 7-10 days down to 3-5 days. Fresh whole blood, collected in such a manner as to preserveplatelets, is required in animals that are manifesting severe hemorrhage. In about 10-20% of the cases, the ITP will be very difficult to keep in remission with safe levels of prednisolone alone, or even with combination prednisolone/cytotoxic drug therapy. In such cases, consider treating with prednisolone and leflunomide, danazol andprednisolone, or drug therapy combined with splenectomy. A statistical linkage between thrombocytopenia and eventual development of lymphoma has been described in dogs (Keller, 1992). Affected dogs are 5.61 timesmore likely to develop this tumor than animals in the general population. 3.2.3. Mixed cytopenias Mixed cytopenias of an immune nature are known in human medicine as Evan's syndrome. In a study of 42 patients, the median age of onset was 7.7 years (range 0.2-26 years); 32/42 had et al., 1997). Intravenous immunoglobulin and glucocorti-coids, the first line of therapy, were variable in effectiveness and but positiveresponses were sustained for two years. Splenectomies performed on 15 patients wereeffective for a median of one month. Other treatments included cyclosporine, vincristine,azathioprine, cyclophosphamide and danazol. The course of disease was characterizedby recurrent thrombocytopenia, hemolytic anemia and neutropenia. After two years, one-third of the patients were in remission, but two-thirds were still on treatment or had died. Mixed cytopenias that closely resemble human Evan's syndrome occur frequently in dogs, with predisposition to purebreds and Cocker spaniels. Like the human disease,affected dogs usually manifest because of the anemia, and thrombocytopenia is detected268 N.C. Pedersen / Veterinary Immunology and Immunopathology 69 (1999) 251-342during the clinical work-up, or vice versa. Many dogs with Evan's syndrome will also be leukopenic, suggesting a broad-based attack on the bone marrow. The various cytopeniasmay occur simultaneously, manifest variably during the same attack, or appear to onedegree or another upon subsequent attacks. Care must be taken not to diagnose Evan'ssyndrome in dogs with immune- or non-immune-mediated blood loss and consumptivethrombocytopenias. For example, many dogs with peracute IHA will have an associatedDIC and consumptive thrombocytopenia. The same is true for dogs with severe babesiosis or haemobartonellosis. Dogs with Evan's syndrome are less likely to respond to glucocorticoid therapy alone, and are more difficult to get into remission withcombination immunosuppressive drug therapy, as is the case with the human disease(Matthew et al., 1997). Relapses may occur at varying times after cessation of treatment.Glucocorticoid and cyclosporine therapy is indicated in difficult-to-treat cases in humans(Emilia et al., 1996; Rackoff and Manno, 1994), and has proved useful in dogs.Leflunomide may prove to be of significant benefit to dogs with refractory disease(Gregory et al., 1998). 3.2.4. Immune-mediated neutropenia Autoimmune neutropenia is a relatively rare disorder. Like other immune cytopenias, it occurs in both idiopathic and secondary forms. Secondary disease is usually associatedwith drugs, in particular anticonvulsants and antibiotics (Jacobs et al., 1998). It must bedifferentiated from pre-myeloproliferative disease and heritable cyclic neutropenia. Autoimmune neutropenia usually presents with acute fever and depression and a profound neutropenia is noted on routine a CBC. Bone marrow cytology is either normalor demonstrates a hypercellular granulocytic series. There are no good tests for autoantibodies to neutrophils. There is usually a good response to long-term prednisolone, or combination immunosuppressive drug treatment. Some dogs may develop 3.2.5. Alloimmune hemolytic anemia 3.2.5.1. reactions . Transfusion reactions are the most common alloimmune disorders of dogs. Dogs have at least 13 different dog erythrocyte antigens (DEA), witheight being internationally standardized (Hale, 1995). Test reagents are available for sixof the eight standard canine blood types, DEA 1.1, 1.2, 2, 3, 4, 5 and 7. DEA 1.1 and 1.2are strongly antigenic in dogs negative for these blood types and the antibodies are verylyric. Antibodies to DEA 3, 5 and 7 are not lyric, but will cause splenic sequestration and subclinical destruction of transfused red cells over a several day period. Antibodies to DEA 4 have no effect on the survival of DEA 4 positive red cells, and for this reason,DEA 4 positive dogs are considered to be the ideal universal donors. Transfusion of DEA 1.1 and 1.2 positive red cells into dogs sensitized against these antigens is of great clinical significance, while transfusion of DEA 3, 5 and 7 red cellsinto dogs sensitized to these antigens is only significant in terms of transfusion efficacy.Although the vast majority of severe transfusion reactions involve alloantibodies to DEA1.1 and 1.2, at least one dog that was DEA 1.1 negative developed highly lyric antibodies to an undetermined blood type following an initial transfusion, and a second transfusionN.C. Pedersen / Veterinary Immunology and Immunopathology 69 (1999) 251-342 269from a DEA 1.1 negative donor resulted in a serious hemolytic episode (Callan et al., 1995). Similar to the situation of the human ABO and cat AB blood groups, many dogs that are DEA 3, 5 and 7 negative will have naturally occurring alloantibodies to these bloodtypes. However, given the infrequency of these blood groups and the non-lyric nature ofanti-DEA 3, 5 and 7 antibodies, such natural antibodies are not of great clinicalsignificance. The greatest risk is to DEA 1.1 and 1.2 negative dogs that have been previously transfused with blood from DEA 1.1 and 1.2 positive donors; these dogs will develop severe reactions to subsequent transfusions with DEA 1.1 and 1.2 positive blood.Sensitization need not involve previous transfusion; a surprising number of dogs withIHA, and no previous transfusion history, will also possess alloantibodies against a rangeof red cell surface antigens, and these alloantibodies can be clinically significant. Theprecise red cell antigens involved in such animals have yet to be determined. Severe signs of blood incompatibility will usually began to appear within 5-15 min of transfusion. The earliest signs are an increase in pulse and respiration, shivering, fever, and edema of the face (angio-neurotic edema). Subsequent signs may cardiac arrythmias; pulmonary edema; renal shut-down; shock; DIC;thrombosis of vessels in the feet, tips of tail and ears leading to gangrene; and death. Recipient and donor dogs must be cross-matched prior to transfusion. The 'major cross-match' involves testing the serum of the recipient against washed RBC of the donorfor gross agglutination. An equal volume of a 1 : 5-1 : 10 dilution of the recipients serumin saline is mixed with an equal volume of a 2% suspension of washed donor RBC insaline. Agglutination will appear within 5-60 min if agglutinins are present. Although gross-agglutination tests will prevent most donor/recipient mismatches, the author has observed at least two instances where severe transfusion reactions occurred in the face ofnegative agglutination tests. In both cases, the recipient was found to contain non-agglutinating antibodies to donor red cells in an indirect Coomb's test. The indirectCoomb's test involves preincubating donor RBCs with recipient serum for an hour or soand washing and resuspending them in saline before adding the Coomb's reagent.Agglutination occurring after the addition of the Coomb's reagent is evidence for thepresence of non-agglutinating antibodies in serum. The recipient's RBCs. Agglutination indicates that the serum of the donor may react with the donor'sRBCs following transfusion if the plasma component is given along with the RBCs. Thisreaction has only minor clinical significance, hence the term minor cross-matchincompatibility. Nonetheless, minor mismatched transfusions should only be done insituations where a better matched donor is not available. Blood transfusions in dogs should always be undertaken with care (Harrell and Kristensen, 1995). In order to avoid transfusion reactions, donor and recipient should be cross-matched prior to transfusion. This should be done even when donors are DEA 1.1 and 1.2 negative. The blood should be transfused slowly for the first 5-10 min wheneverpossible, and if adverse reactions are noted in the first few minutes, the transfusion shouldbe aborted. The worst thing is to have given all of the blood prior to the onset of adversesigns. Pretreatment with antihistamines and corticosteroids will not prevent the reactionfrom occurring, but may make it somewhat milder. Once a severe transfusion reaction270 N.C. Pedersen / Veterinary Immunology and Immunopathology 69 (1999) 251-342occurs, treat with massive dosages of steroids, control shock, support renal function, and be prepared to give oxygen. An immune complex vasculitis has been observed followingsome acute transfusion reactions and can lead to major tissue infarctions 24-72 h Neonatal isoerytholysis has been described in puppies, associated mainly with DEA 1.1 (Hale, 1995). A small proportion of DEA 1.1 negativebitches can be sensitized to DEA 1.1 if carrying DEA 1.1 positive puppies, probably bytransplacental leakage of fetal red cells. The bitch will then make alloantibodies to DEA1.1, which will be passed to the puppies in the colostrum. Clinical signs appear within the first day or two after nursing and include anemia, lethargy, jaundice, tachypnea, tachycardia, hepatosplenomegaly and occasionally hemoglobinuria. Mildly affectedpuppies can be treated symptomatically with rest and good nursing care. Severelyaffected puppies may require extensive blood transfusion. When in doubt as to whichdonor to use, washed (plasma-free) RBCs from the bitch is an obvious choice becausethere is negligible chance that they will be destroyed by the puppy. 3.3. Non-cytolytic diseases involving autoantibodies3.3.1. Myasthenia gravis Myasthenia gravis occurs in an acquired (autoimmune) and congenital (familial or genetic) form in both man and dogs. The congenital form does not have an immune basis,while the acquired form is associated with the production of antibodies to acetylcholinereceptors. These antibodies lead to a diminution of these structures on the postsynapticsarcolemma. The acquired form is far more common than the congenital form in dogs,and the incidence of acquired myasthenia gravis in dogs is even greater than for humans. Similar to the human disease, myasthenia gravis in dogs has been observed as a sequelae of thymoma. However, this relationship is not nearly as common in dogs as inpeople (Lainesse et al., 1996; Rusbridge et al., 1996). In a study of 23 canine thymomas,11 of the animals had megaesophagus, and myasthenia gravis was confirmed in seven ofthese 11 (Atwater et al., 1994). Paradoxically, one dog developed clinical signs ofmyasthenia gravis after removal of the thymoma. None of the dogs had evidence ofdistant metastasis. Histologically, the predominant tumor types were differentiated-epithelial (9/23) and lymphocyte-rich (6/23). Shelton et al. (1997) studied 1154 dogs residing within the United States from 1991 to 1995 with acquired myasthenia gravis. Purebred dogs had a greater risk than mixed-breeds; dogs with the highest risk of acquired myasthenia gravis were Akitas, terriergroup, and Jack Russell Terriers had low relative risks.Sexually intact males and dogs less than one year old had some protection from risk. Several clinical forms of acquired myasthenia gravis have been described (Dewey et al., 1997; Webb et al., 1997). About one-third of affected dogs had no historical or clinical evidence of appendicular muscle weakness, and are designated as focal myasthenics. Dogs with focal myasthenia usually exhibited weakness in facial,pharyngeal, and laryngeal muscles.N.C. Pedersen / Veterinary (1999) 251-342 271About two-thirds of myasthenic dogs present for systemic disease, usually combinations of appendicular weakness and megaesophagus. The systemic form ofmyasthenia in dogs is subdivided into chronic generalized and acute fulminating forms;one-fourth of dogs have a fulminating onset and three-fourths chronic. Most of the dogswith systemic myasthenia, regardless of form, will manifest signs of megaesophagus, anda smaller proportion will demonstrate facial, laryngeal, or pharyngeal weakness.Historical evidence of exercise-associated appendicular weakness is observed in about one-half of dogs with chronic generalized myasthenia gravis, while dogs with acute fulminating myasthenia gravis usually presented with sudden weakness. About one-halfof dogs with either chronic or fulminate generalized myasthenia demonstrate primarilypelvic limb weakness. Third degree atrioventricular block was diagnosed in four dogs with acquired myasthenia gravis and megaesophagus (Hackett et al., 1995). Two of these dogs also hadmediastinal thymomas. Three dogs in a series of 23 with thymomas also developed third-degree atrioventricular heart block, one of which had generalized myositis involving the cardiac muscle (Atwater et al., 1994). Therefore, heart problems may complicate myasthenia gravis in dogs. The diagnosis of myasthenia gravis is based on signalment (i.e., breed, age), history, clinical findings, results of IV edrophonium chloride administration, electromyographicfindings (decremental reduction of amplitude on repetitive nerve stimulation), presenceor absence of muscle membrane staining by immunocytochemical methods, serumacetylcholine receptor antibody concentration (Holland et al., 1994), treatment, andoutcome. An acetylcholine receptor antibody titer of >0.6 nmol/l is considered diagnostic for acquired myasthenia gravis (Shelton et al., 1997). One half of myasthenic dogs die or are euthanatized shortly after admission to the hospital due to aspiration pneumonia. The dogs with acute fulminating myasthenia gravishad a markedly higher one-year mortality rate in comparison with the other two groups.The principal treatment is anti-cholinergics such as pyridostigmine bromide, which willusually improve overall muscle strength. The additional use of immunosuppressivetherapy had a significant positive effect on patient survival, regardless of the type ofmyasthenia gravis. Surgical removal of thymomas in dogs with these tumors has had mixed results. In two German Shepherd Dogs, the disease did not resolve, but there was a more satisfactory control of clinical signs with anticholinesterase treatment (Rusbridge etal., 1996) Surgical removal of a thymic mass in an older Cocker Spaniel resulted in rapidresolution of clinical signs and a decrease in serum acetylcholine-receptor antibodyconcentration, but signs recurred six months postoperatively with regrowth of thethymoma (Lainesse et al., 1996). Two dogs with thymomas, megaesophagus, and thirddegree heart blocks died of aspiration pneumonia within three months of surgicalresection of their tumors (Hackett et al., 1995). Equally poor results were obtained in a larger study; six of nine dogs with thymoma and megaesophagus that underwent surgery died or were euthanatized within one week of diagnosis (Atwater et al., 1994). 3.3.2. Tempormandibular myopathies (Masticatory myopathies) Dogs appear to be uniquely susceptible to autoimmune disorders involving the masticatory muscles (Lewis, 1994; Shelton and Cardinet, 1987). Purebreds are272 N.C. Pedersen / Veterinary Immunology and Immunopathology 69 (1999) 251-342predisposed to the condition, and the Cocker spaniel may be over represented. The specificity of these diseases is probably related to the unique structure of these muscles indogs. The masticatory muscles of dogs have a unique myofiber proteins (myosin enzymesand myosin light and heavy chains) compared to limb muscles (Shelton et al., 1985a, b,1988). Autoantibodies against unique type 2 M fiber proteins can be found bound in themuscle and free in the serum (Shelton et al., 1987). Antibody targets included a 185 kDaprotein, myosin heavy chain, and light chain-2 masticatory myosin. Masticatory myopathies may be manifested acutely with swelling of the tempoman- dibular muscles and severe pain on opening of the mouth. In many dogs, however, thisacute stage goes unnoticed and the muscle disease is more chronic and low-grade; themuscles slowly atrophy and are replaced by fibrous tissue. There is no obvious pain andthe first clinical abnormality is often manifested in difficulty in eating and drinkingassociated with an inability to open the mouth as a result of muscle and tendoncontracture. Eosinophilia may or may not be present. The diagnosis is usually based onthe characteristic clinical signs and muscle biopsy. Antibodies can be measured in the serum against normal masticatory muscle proteins. Affected dogs are treated initially with high doses of prednisolone. The jaw slowly begins to open after several weeks on treatment, although usually never back to normal.The treatment is discontinued, therefore, after the animal can open its mouth enough toeat and drink comfortably. 3.3.3. Bullous dermatitides The bullous dermatitides are characterized by the formation of autoantibodies to various intracellular cement proteins of mucocutaneous junctions and/or skin. The binding of antibodies to intracellular cement leads to the breakdown of the bonds between various cell layers leading to a cleft, which is then filled with fluid and forms a blister orbullae. The blister rapidly ruptures leaving an underlying ulcer that varies in depthaccording to the layer of the epidermis that is affected. The layer of the epidermis that isaffected is, in turn, dependent on the particular intracellular cement substance that is thetarget of attack. Lesions tend to be concentrated on mucocutaneous junctions of themouth, eyes, anus, vulva, prepuce and skin in certain areas of the on theparticular disease). 3.3.3.1. Pemphigus foliaceous . Pemphigus foliaceous is surprisingly common in dogs and has been associated with the formation of autoantibodies to epidermal proteins of 85, 125, and 160 kDa (Iwasaki et al., 1996, 1997). The 160 kDa protein is of the same size as human desmoglein 1, the predominant antigenic target in pemphigus foliaceous inpeople. The disease occurs predominantly in purebreds, with a large number of breedsrepresented (Kuhl et al., 1994). However, Akitas, English Springer Spaniels, ChowChows, Chinese shar pei and Collies are from 4 to 40 times more likely to developpemphigus foliaceous than other breeds. Pemphigus foliaceous in dogs usually occurs between the ages of two and seven years and is gradually (75% of cases) or rapidly progressive (25% of cases). This is the most superficial of the bullous dermatitides. The lesions are generalized, patchy, facial (80% of cases), or pedal orientated. The lesions in 50% of the dog appear first over the bridge ofN.C. Pedersen / Veterinary Immunology and Immunopathology 69 (1999) 251-342 273the nose. Lesions are characterized by crusting, scaling, and alopecia. The inside of the mouth is usually unaffected. The disease in Akitas, and less often in other breeds, may be associated with uveitis. Such cases may be mistaken for the V oight/Koronada/Harada (VKH) syndrome, whichoccurs most commonly in people of Japanese extraction. VKH is due to a cell-mediatedautoimmune attack on melanocytes, which in humans is often manifested by uveitis,meningitis, and depigmenting skin lesions. A VKH-like syndrome does occur in dogs, but mainly in Chow chows. Biopsies of affected skin of dogs with pemphigus foliaceous shows vesicopustules directly beneath the stratum corneum Microabscesses may also beobserved within the external hair deposition of immunoglobu-lin in areas of intracellular cement (Shinya et al., 1996). Sera from 65% of affected dogswill have antibodies that react with bovine esophagus. Bovine esophagus is the substrate of choice when compared to bovine nose or tongue, monkey esophagus and canine nose (Iwasaki et al., 1996). About 40% of animals will respond to high dose steroid treatment followed by maintenance treatment. Drug-free remission is very rare. Animals that fail to respondwell to glucocorticoids alone, or which require toxic levels to keep the disease undercontrol, can be treated with glucocorticoids and azathioprine, glucocorticoids andcyclophosphamide, glucocorticoids and gold salts. Drug toxicities become a problemwith time, because of the difficulty of achieving full remission or of sustaining remission once treatment is discontinued. Leflunomide and a glucocorticoid used in combination may provide better long-term control and less side-effects. 3.3.3.2. Pemphigus vulgaris . Pemphigus vulgaris is a much pemphigus foliaceous and predominates in purebreds. Unlike pemphigus foliaceous,which tends spare the mucocutaneous junctions, pemphigus vulgaris has a predilectionfor the mucocutaneous the eyes, nostrils, anus, prepuce, rectum ornipples and the mucosa of the inside of the mouth (cheeks, palate, tongue). Involvementof the nail beds is also seen. The lesions are frequently secondarily infected with bacteriaand are painful and pruritic. Affected animals are often systemically ill, as demonstratedby malaise and weight loss. Intact vesicles can sometimes be seen upon frequent and careful examination of the mucous membranes. These blisters are due to a subrabasiler cleft formed aroundacantholytic keratinocytes. Signs of secondary bacterial infection and inflammation arecommon. The same as for pemphigus foliaceous, but may need to treat for secondary bacterial infection during the initial stages of therapy. However, remission is more difficult toachieve and the long-term prognosis is even worse. 3.3.3.3. Bullous pemphigoid . Bullous pemphigoid sheepdogs, Collies, and perhaps Doberman pinschers, may be over-represented. Dogs are usually affected as young adults. Lesions appear as deep ulcers of274 N.C. Pedersen / Veterinary Immunology and Immunopathology 69 (1999) 251-342the skin and mucocutaneous junctions, often having an outward appearance similar to full-thickness burns. Lesions are concentrated on mucocutaneous junctions of the oralcavity, anus, vulva or prepuce, and skin of the axilla groin. Bullae may be seen uponcareful examination. The bulla involves separation of the entire epidermis from thedermis along basal lamina. basal lamina. Autoantibodies in dog were found to react with a180 Kd glycoprotein from canine skin analogous to the 230/180 Kd bullous pemphigoid (BP) antigen of humans (Iwasaki et al., 1995a). The condition carries a poor prognosis due to difficulty in achieving and maintaining full remission. The treatment of choice is a glucocorticoid used in combination withazathioprine. Combined glucocorticoid/leflunomide therapy needs to be evaluated for thiscondition. 4. Immune complex diseases (Type III reactions) 4.1. Immunopathogenesis of immune complex disorders Immune complex diseases involve: 1. formation of circulating antigen-antibody complexes; 2. passage of immune complexes through endothelial gaps; 3. complement fixation; 4. inflammatory response; and finally,5. localized vascular damage. Therefore, the hallmark lesion of immune complex disease is vasculitis. The vasculitis can be associated with acute inflammation (e.g., synovitis, uveitis), vascular thrombosisand tissue necrosis (e.g., glossal and palatine ulcers), hemorrhage (e.g., purpurahemorrhagica), or a more insidious disease of the vascular wall (e.g., glomerulonephritis). Immune complexes (antigen-antibody complement aggregates) are generated in situations where both antigens and corresponding antibodies coexist in the blood and/ortissues. Chronic antigen formation occurs in the following situations: 1. infectious diseases; 2. drugs; 3. acute or chronic use of foreign proteins; and4. autoimmune diseases. All microbial infections generate immune complexes. In the case of acute diseases such as influenza, the complexes exist only for the period of time that the organisms areactively replicating. During this time, however, they may contribute to the overall clinicalsyndrome, e.g. transient muscle and joint pain, fever, etc. Persistent immune-complex related signs may occur, however, if the infection should become chronic. Four types of interactions between the drug and tissue can lead to antibodies: the drug binds directly to a tissue protein, a drug-carrier complex is formed, and antibodies areN.C. Pedersen / Veterinary Immunology and Immunopathology 69 (1999) 251-342 275directed against the drug (hapten) moiety; the drug is biotransformed into a more haptenogenic compound, which then binds with tissue proteins and elicits antibodies tothe biotransformant; the drug or its metabolite interacts with the tissues and forms a newantigenic site; or the drug or its metabolite reacts with the tissue and causesconformational changes in the tissue protein rendering it antigenic. Serum sickness is a classical disease resulting from the use of heterologous antiserum. Immune serum is used for the treatment or prevention of certain infections or toxicities. After the initial inoculation of foreign protein, antibodies appear in three to seven days. Immune complexes are then formed and clinical signs of fever, lymphadenopathy, rash,and joint and muscle pain appear. These signs will persist until all of the foreign protein isbound and the complexes are removed by the RE system. Certain immune complex diseases involve antibodies to self-antigens. Immune complexes in SLE consist of antinuclear antibodies and corresponding nuclear antigens.In rheumatoid arthritis (RA) of man, and possibly RA of dogs, autoantibodies areproduced against denatured or immune complexed IgG. These autoantibodies are called rheumatoid factors. Rheumatoid factors also appear in the blood of some animals with chronic infections. Rheumatoid factors are one way that the body has of clearing smaller-sized immune complexes. Rheumatoid factors are only pathogenic when their productionis excessive. In such cases, they may contribute to immune complex disease, as they do inrheumatoid arthritis of people. Immune complexes of large size (created in the zone of antibody excess) are cleared directly by the RE system. Small complexes (created in the zone of antigen excess) arevery small and move freely between the intra- and extra-cellular fluid spaces. Immune complexes generated under the conditions of slight antigen excess, however, are intermediate in size and are more likely to be deposited in the endothelium. Immunecomplexes of proper configuration will pass through the endothelial gaps but will becomeembedded within the basement membranes. Immune complexes may also form in situ inthe area of the basement membranes rather than be carried in a preformed fashion fromother sites. This will occur in situations where the proteins of the basement membranesare themselves immunogenic, or in situations where free antigen is trapped in thebasement membrane and antibodies to the antigen are generated at a later time. The likelihood of immune complexes depositing in a given organ depends on several factors: 1. the physical or anatomic make-up of the endothelial bed; 2. relative blood flow the organ;3. conditions increasing vascular permeability, i.e. histamine release;4. the specific chemical make-up and charge of the complex; and5. genetic factors. Immune complexes are in equilibrium with free antigen and antibodies in the tissues. The rate of complex deposition will vary therefore with the amount of antigen and antibodyformed at any given period of time. Immune complex formation is a normal reaction tomost acute infectious or antigen-releasing disorders. Most complexes that are depositedacutely in basement membranes are rapidly dissolved when the period of antibody excess276 N.C. Pedersen / Veterinary Immunology and Immunopathology 69 (1999) 251-342(convalescence) is reached, which occurs before there is any permanent damage to the basement membranes. The deposition of immune complexes per se does not lead to disease. Problems arise only when the host responds to the complexes and a local inflammatory reaction iselicited. Immune complexes were initially thought to cause localized inflammation bybinding complement and attracting neutrophils into the area; inflammatory mediatorsreleased by the neutrophils were ultimately responsible for the lesions. Immune complex lesions, however, can also occur in the absence of neutrophils or complement. The role of macrophages, and macrophage kinins, in immune-complex induced inflammation iscurrently an important area for study. Macrophages are one of the most consistentinflammatory cells found in immune complex lesions. 4.2. Specific disorders involving immune complex-induced vasculitis 4.2.1. Systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) Any discussion of SLE in dogs should be prefaced by a description of the disease in people. Lupus or 'wolf-like' refers to the patchy depigmentation and erythema of the skinon the face of humans with SLE. However, skin lesions are only one part of thesyndrome. In fact, virtually every organ system in the body can be affected in people withSLE. SLE is a common disorder, seen in 1 : 2000 humans. It affects females more than males (4 : 1), and blacks more than whites. Most patients are 10-50 years of age when the firstsigns are seen, with a particularly high incidence in the 20-40 year age group. There is some familial clustering in people. Offspring of affected individuals have a twofold or more higher incidence, and relatives of people with clinical SLE often have serologicalevidence of the disease but no clinical signs. Humans with SLE are more likely to havethe HLA-DR2 or -DR3 leukocyte types than non-affected individuals. DLA-A7 wasfound to have a strong positive relationship to SLE in German shepherd dogs, whileDLA-A1 and DLA-B5 were negatively related (Teichner et al., 1990). The disease in man runs several courses. 1. Fulminating disease with a rapid progression of signs. 2. Cyclic disease in which the first attacks are the most severe and frequent; over a period of 5-10 years the attacks become milder and further apart. 3. Chronic low-grade disease, occasionally interrupted by periods of increased disease activity. 4. Serologically positive individuals with few if any signs of illness. Any number of organ systems can be involved in SLE. There is a tendency, however, for the disease to localize in one or two organs. The most life-threatening complication of SLE in man is kidney failure, followed in frequency by neurological complications. The10-year survival rate of people with SLE now exceeds 85%. SLE has been recognized in almost all species of animals of veterinary importance. It has been best described, however, in the dog. Canine SLE is as prevalent, or perhaps moreso, than its human counterpart. It occurs mainly in purebred, especially sporting breedsN.C. Pedersen / Veterinary Immunology and Immunopathology 69 (1999) 251-342 277such as Spaniels, Pointers, Retrievers, German Shepherd dogs, and Doberman Pinschers. It is also common in many non-sporting breeds such as the Spitz and Poodle. The usualage of onset in dogs is from 1 to 8 years of age, with most cases occurring in the 2-4 yearrange. This is similar to the proportionate age incidence for people. SLE is often diagnosed on the basis of the presence of certain typical symptoms and the absence of exclusionary diseases, and attempts have been made to utilize such criteriafor canine SLE. However, if human criterium are strictly adhered to, most dogs with 'SLE' would not qualify. Dogs tend to have one or two systemic signs, often polyarthritis, while skin, hematologic, CNS, and renal manifestations are less important (Pedersenet al., Krum et al., 1977; Monier et al., 1978; Slappendel et al., 1972). The etiology of SLE in man and animals has not been determined, although gender and genetics play a role. Estrogen enhances disease, while testosterone is protective. Closerelatives of SLE patients are 2-5 times more likely to develop SLE. In man, almost 25different drugs, and in particular hydralazine and procainamide, will also induce a lupus-like syndrome. Drug induced disease differs, however, from naturally occurring SLE in the following ways: 1. the sex ratio is equal; 2. nephritis and CNS signs are not seen;3. serum complement levels are usually normal and antibodies to native DNA are absent;4. clinical and laboratory abnormalities return to normal when the drugs are discontinued. SLE has been seen in 20% or less of aged cats chronically treated with prophylthiouracil for hyperthyroidism, but drug induced SLE has not been described in dogs. SLE in man and animals has many features in common, but the hallmark is antinuclear antibody (ANA). ANAs seem to be produced in response to a slow and insidious releaseof nucleic acids in the presence of a hyper-responsive immune system. Once formed,ANAs will react with this slowly released nucleic acid and form immune complexes. Theantinuclear antibodies are directed against single stranded or denatured DNA (ssDNA),saline soluble (extractable) non-DNA Thoren- Tolling and Ryden, 1991; White et al., 1992). Antibodies to nuclear glycoproteins notassociated with DNA have also been detected in dogs with SLE (Soulard et al., 1991).Antibodies to double stranded DNA, a hallmark of human SLE, may not be as importantin dogs (Jones, 1993). Unlike the situation seen in type II immune diseases, anti-nuclear antibodies are not in themselves pathogenic. Mothers with SLE can pass on high titers of ANA to their babies,but there is no evidence of disease in the infants. Furthermore, SLE in people and animals sometimes occurs in the absence of detectable ANA (seronegative lupus). By definition, such individuals do not have SLE, because ANA is a diagnostic criteria. The diseasesyndrome in ANA negative individuals is otherwise indistinguishable. SLE has been called the prototypic immune complex disease; circulating immune complexes pass through endothelial cell junctions and are trapped in the underlyingbasement membranes. Complement is bound to the complexes, and this in turn can lead278 N.C. Pedersen / Veterinary Immunology and Immunopathology 69 (1999) 251-342to the influx of polymorphonuclear cells and localized inflammation. This reaction is localized around blood vessels, hence vasculitis is one of the hallmarks of SLE. If thevascular reaction occurs in glomeruli, glomerulonephritis is the result. Vasculitis blood vessels-pancreatitis; GI tract-colicand ulcers, etc. Immune complexes in the skin are usually found around small dermal vessels and in the basal lamina. Deposition of immune complexes in the skin does not always cause lesions by itself, but is potentiated by exposure to solar radiation. Lesionson the extremities (face, hands, ears, bridge of nose, etc.) are therefore, the most striking. People and animals with SLE suffer from several immunologic abnormalities besides immune complex disease. SLE is associated with a state of immunologic hyperresponsiveness, mainly in the B-cell system. There is a deficiency of T-suppressorlymphocytes and an increase in antibody levels to many common antigens, especially ofviral origin. Individuals with SLE also have a greater than normal propensity to make autoantibodies, especially to RBCs, platelets, and leukocyte antigens. Antibodies to coagulation proteins (circulating anticoagulants) develop in 10-15% of humans with SLEand have been reported in a dog (Stone et al., 1994). Anti-coagulants are againstphospholipids and intrinsic clotting factors such as factor VIII. These antibodies cancause thrombotic or hemorrhagic complications in some people and dogs. Humans withSLE also frequently develop false positive serologic tests for syphilis. This is due to thedevelopment of cross-reacting antibodies to phospholipids that are present in manyorgans and on the syphilis spirochete. Some dogs with SLE will produce antibodies to heat shock proteins (Bell et al., 1995). About 30% of the humans with SLE develop rheumatoid factors, as do a similar proportion of dogs with SLE (Chabanne et al., 1993).Rheumatoid factors are antibodies (IgM) that react with immune complexed or denaturedIgG. Lymphocytotoxic antibodies are also detected in the serum of some human andcanine patients. The most common feature of SLE in dogs is a cyclic, antibiotic unresponsive fever accompanied by one or more organ specific signs. Polyarthritis occurs in 70-90% ofpeople and animals with SLE. It is a non-erosive, inflammatory arthritis. Proximal joints are less severely involved than distal joints. Most animals show generalized stiffness, difficulty in getting up and laying down, or a shifting limb lameness. Polymyositis andpolyneuritis may also occur in dogs; it is seldom seen by itself and usually accompaniespolyarthritis (Krum, 1997). Pleuritis is frequently seen radiographically in dogs withflorid SLE, but is usually not clinically apparent. Skin lesions are uncommonaccompanying features in dogs compared to humans. Macular erythematous, crusty,and sometimes ulcerative lesions. Usually on the face (bridge of nose, eyebrows, ears,margins of lips). Dermatitis, when seen, is often the predominant feature. Ulcerative (infarctive) lesions of the palate, tongue and digits can be an accompanying or primary feature of SLE in dogs. Neurologic signs are seen in 10-50% of humans, but areuncommon in dogs. Transverse myelopathy is an uncommon sequelae of SLE in dogs andpeople. Leukopenia, a common sign of SLE in man, is uncommon in dogs.Glomerulonephritis, as a histologic or immunohistologic diagnosis, is common in dogswith SLE, but is much less likely to progress to renal failure than in people.N.C. Pedersen / Veterinary Immunology and Immunopathology 69 (1999) 251-342 279About 10% or more of dogs with presenting for IHA or ITP have serologic evidence of SLE. Conversely, only a small portion of dogs with the immune complex (i.e., vasculitis)manifestations of SLE will have concurrent IHA or ITP. The diagnosis of SLE is based on signalment (breed predispositions, age), disease signs compatible with systemic vasculitis and/or autoimmune cytopenias, and ANA positivity.The fluorescent ANA (FANA) test is the standard screening test for all types ofANAs. The FANA is an indirect immunofluorescence assay where serial dilutions of patient serum are reacted with acetone fixed cell culture monolayers, usually human or mouse hepatoma cells, or with rat liver sections (McVey and Shuman, 1991; Thoren-Tolling and Ryden, 1991). FANA titers animals are usually low (1 : 16-1 : 256)compared to man. Some normal animals will have ANA, so a positive ANA is diagnosticonly when it occurs with appropriate clinical manifestations of SLE. The original lupuserythematosus (LE) cell procedure has many false positives and negatives in dogs and isseldom used. SLE in dogs is treated in a similar manner to SLE in people. The initial attacks of disease are usually the worst and must be treated the most vigorously. Initial treatment often consists of glucocorticoids alone, although combination immunosuppressivetherapy is ultimately required in many affected dogs. Once the disease is brought intoremission, it can be kept that way with a minimum of drug therapy. About one-half of theanimals may be withdrawn from therapy after six months to a year, while the remaindermust be treated indefinitely. Glomerulonephritis, when present, is the most difficult partof the syndrome to treat and the disease manifestation that is most apt to be clinicallysilent until substantial organ damage has occurred. Therefore, renal function should be periodically monitored even through other signs of SLE appear under control. ANA will disappear when animals are in full remission and reappear upon relapse and is therefore agood monitor of disease control. 4.2.2. Discoid lupus Discoid lupus is the most common disease of the nasal planum of dogs, especially in regions of high solar radiation (White, 1994). The disease occurs most commonly inpurebreds with long nose confirmation, but especially in Collies and Shetland sheepdogs.The disease is considered to be a focal form of SLE, with deposition of immune complexes in the basement membrane. Nuclear antigens have been extracted from the lesions of at least one dog with discoid lupus, suggesting that they help make up theimmune complexes (White et al., 1992). Disease of the basement membrane renders theskin more susceptible to the effects of solar radiation, which are focused most intenselyon the nasal planum and on to the nose. The result is a low grade inflammation of thenasal planum with depigmentation. Constant licking of the lesions can lead to additionaldamage to the nose. Increased numbers of epidermal langerhan cells expressing MHCclass II have been seen in dogs with discoid lupus, but not with pemphigus foliaceous (Day, 1996a, b, c). Antinuclear antibodies are usually not found in the circulation, but have been observed on occasion (Iwasaki et al., 1995b). Treatment is withimmunosuppressive drugs, usually Glucocorticoids, sun screens, and avoidance ofsunlight. A combination of tetracycline and niacinamide has also shown promise in dogwith discoid lupus (White et al., 1992).280 N.C. Pedersen / Veterinary Immunology and Immunopathology 69 (1999) 251-3424.2.3. Vasculitis occurring secondary to drugs, chronic infectious diseases, autoimmune disorders Deposition of antigen-antibody complexes and complement in blood vessel walls can cause varying degrees of inflammation, hemorrhage, thrombosis and necrosis inassociated tissues. Most forms of vasculitis have a significant dermal component,although lesions may be seen simultaneously in a variety of additional organs. There areseveral predisposing causes, including: 1. drugs; 2. chronic infectious diseases; and3. autoimmune diseases such as SLE. Drug induced vasculitides have been well documented in dogs (Noli et al., 1995). Sulfa drugs, including trimethoprim-sulfa, erythromycin, carbimazole), and a number of other drugshave been commonly associated with this syndrome in people, so the potential to see druginduced vasculitis in dogs will undoubtedly increase the sophistication of veterinary medicine increases and animals are treated with a wider range of drugs and for longer periods of time. Most drug reactions consist of two components; some type of dermal eruption, with or without systemic signs of fever, and arthralgia. Drug eruptions in people (dermatitismedicamentosa) have been classified into the following categories: 1. toxic red and scaly); 8. photosensitivity (skin lesions potentiated by sunlight and lesions are more frequent on exposed areas of skin); 9. drug-related SLE;10. fixed eruptions (erythematous plaques that occur at the same spot each time the drug is reinstituted); 12. toxic epidermal necrolysis (an uncommon condition with severe consequences in some cases, large areas of skin became devascularized); 13. urticaria; 14. pruritus (itchy skin without obvious lesions);15. hair loss; and16. pigmentary changes in the skin. Virtually all of these forms have been seen in dogs to varying degree.N.C. Pedersen / Veterinary Immunology and Immunopathology 69 (1999) these numerous vasculitis, drug-related SLE, and toxic epidermal necrolysis are most likely to be caused by immune complexmediated vascular damage. The characteristic clinical feature of these conditions is theabrupt appearance of skin lesions characterized by focal hemorrhage and inflammation,tissue death, and tissue sloughing. Toxic epidermal necrolysis is the most severe of thesediseases, with large segments of skin becoming devitalized and gangrenous.Histopathologic lesions are extremely varied and the vasculitis component is sometimes difficult to appreciate. Diagnosis is made on the basis of the appearance of lesions and temporal relationship to drug therapy. The diagnosis is confirmed by response to drugwithdrawal. Vasculitis in one form or another is a common feature of many chronic infectious diseases. Glomerulonephritis, uveitis, polyarthritis, and dermatopathies have beendescribed in a wide range of infections such as monocytic and granulocytic ehrlichiosis,Rocky Mountain spotted fever, Lyme mycotic infections, and visceral leishmaniasis. Vasculitis may accompany other immune diseases in dogs such as SLE, rheumatoid arthritis and hypothyroidism. 4.2.4. Immune vasculitis with no apparent cause (Idiopathic vasculitis) As the name implies, animals with idiopathic vasculitis have no identifiable predisposing cause. Human diseases of this type include leukocytoclastic angiitis,polyarteritis nodosa, giant cell arteritis, allergic granulomatosis, and Wegener'sgranulomatosis. Conditions similar to all of these diseases have been seen in dogs.Whether the diseases in animals are exact analogues, however, remains to be proven. Idiopathic vasculitis in dogs is usually manifested as ulcerative lesions on the palate, tongue, lower limbs, and digits. A systemic vasculitis, with widespread petechia andecchymoses and subcutaneous hemorrhaging has been observed in Italian Greyhounds;the condition resembles hemorrhagica of man. An idiopathic necotizing been described in racing Greyhounds (Carpenter et al.,1988; Cowan et al., 1997). Systemic recortizing vasculitis has been reported in nineyoung beagles (Scott-Moncrieff et al., 1992). Acute or chronic edema, especially of oneor both hind limbs may also be an unusual manifestation of idiopathic vasculitis in dogs. The diagnosis of idiopathic vasculitis is made by confirming the presence of vasculitis on deep biopsies and the ruling out of all possible secondary causes. The treatment issimilar to other immune diseases, starting with glucocorticoids alone and adding in otherimmunosuppressive agents if necessary. 4.2.5. Non-erosive immune-mediated arthritides A non-erosive, non-infectious arthritis occurs in the dog, and though etiologically diverse, it is probably mediated by similar immunopathologic mechanisms (Pedersenet al., 1976b; Pederson and Pool, 1978). The presenting clinical signs of this type of arthritis are similar, whether it is idiopathic or associated with secondary infectious disease, SLE, neoplasia, inflammatory bowel disease, or drug hypersensitivity. The jointdisease tends to be cyclic in nature, has a predisposition for smaller distal joints, thecarpus and tarsus in particular, and can occur in monarticular (rare), pauciarticular282 N.C. Pedersen / Veterinary Immunology and Immunopathology 69 (1999) 251-342(uncommon), or polyarticular (common) forms. Radiographic changes, even after many months of joint disease, tend to be minimal or non-existent, and are limited to soft tissueswelling. Biopsies of the synovial membranes show erosionsand pannus formation are not prominent features in these diseases. Regardless of the overlying or underlying disease processes that lead to the arthritis, the joint disease is believed to be due to deposition of immune complexes in the synovial membrane with resultant type III immune (i.e., vasculitis) reaction. In idiopathic non- deforming arthritis, the origin and nature of the antigen in the complexes are unknown;the antigens in SLE are of nuclear origin; the antigen in enteropathic arthritis probablyoriginates from the inflamed bowel; while antigens in arthritis secondary to chronicinfectious disease or neoplasia originate from the offending microorganisms or thetumor cells. 4.2.5.1. Idiopathic non-deforming arthritis . Idiopathic non-deforming arthritis is by far the most common disorder of dogs manifesting immune-mediated arthritis (Pedersenet al., 1976b; Pederson and Pool, 1978). It is termed idiopathic because there is noevidence of underlying diseases. This disorder occurs most predominantly in purebreds.Although there is a feeling that medium and larger sporting-type breeds are moreaffected, the condition has also been observed in many small breeds. A possible association between immune-mediated thyroiditis and hypothyroidism may exist; the numerous breeds that suffer from hypothyroidism are among the breeds most commonlyaffected with idiopathic non-deforming arthritis. An idiopathic non-deformingpolyarthritis has also been recognized in cats, but much less frequently than in dogs. The disease is usually manifested in animals from 1 to 6 years of age, but is not unusual in puppies, adolescents and older dogs. The initial presenting history is one ofcyclic fever, during which malaise, anorexia, lameness, or generalized stiffness are noted.The fever is most pronounced in dogs with polyarticular disease and least pronounced in animals with monarticular involvement. In severely affected dogs, periods of remission are usually incomplete, in which case the disease can be very debilitating. Generalizedmuscle atrophy and disproportionate atrophy of the temporal and masseter muscles arefrequently seen. This atrophy is due in part to disuse, but in many cases the diseaseprocess also involves the muscles or nerves. During the most severe stages of the disease, swelling and heat in distal joints are sometimes detected. Generalized lymphadenopathy may be noted in varying degrees.During periods of disease activity, a leukocytosis with neutrophilia and hyperfibrino- genemia is often observed. Polyarticular involvement is the most common presentation, with the dogs showing generalized stiffness and reluctance to move their spine, tail, orlimbs. Toy breeds, which often have severe generalized arthritis, can become virtuallyimmobile, making it difficult to tell whether the joints are the source of the problem, orwhether the immobility is due solely to depression. Radiographic abnormalities are usually not present, except for an increase in the amount of periarticular soft tissue due to inflammation or fibrosis. If the disease is presentfor many months without treatment, however, some mild degenerative changes can occur in the joints. Persistent hyperemia of the synovium can lead to severe periarticularN.C. Pedersen / Veterinary Immunology and Immunopathology 69 (1999) 251-342 283periosteal bone proliferation in rare individuals. These radiographic abnormalities can lead to a mistaken diagnosis of degenerative joint disease (DJD). Obviously, suchmisdiagnosis will greatly influence the type of therapy selected. It is important, therefore,to always take a sample of synovial fluid from dogs with DJD changes that are atypicalfor that disease. Diagnosis is made by consideration of the clinical history of an antibiotic-unresponsive cyclical fever, malaise, and anorexia, upon which is superimposed stiffness or lameness. The cyclical nature of the disease complicates diagnosis because affected dogs may appear to respond favorably to antibiotic therapy when in fact the improvement is due tocoincidental cyclic variation of the inflammatory process. Synovial fluid analysis is imperative, even if there are no signs of joint pain, swelling and reddening (Pedersen, 1978). Synovial fluid from affected individuals contains from5000 to 100 000 or more white cells per ml. The predominant cells in the fluid are the neutrophils; these cells appear non-toxic and with normal granulation. The fluid is sterilefor bacteria, viruses, Mycoplasma , and Chlamydia . Serologic abnormalities such as the LE cell phenomenon, antinuclear antibody, and rheumatoid factor are absent. Blood cultures are negative for bacteria, and there are no signs of primary infectious processesin other areas of the body. Treatment involves the use of glucocorticoids alone or in combination with more potent immunosuppressive drugs (see Section 4.2.5.2). A complete remission of signs canusually be achieved. From 30% to 50% of the dogs will have recurrences of illness afterthe drug therapy is discontinued. 4.2.5.2. Non-deforming arthritis associated with chronic infectious diseases . A non- deforming arthritis associated with chronic infectious disease has been described in dogs(Pedersen et al., 1976b; Bennett, 1986; van der Wel and Meyer, 1995). This type of arthritis has been associated with subacute bacterial endocarditis; pyometra; discospondylitis; chronic Actinomyces infections heartworm disease; urinary tractinfections and Since these infections are often difficult to pinpoint,the arthritis may be the main or sole presenting complaint. It is important, therefore, tomake a thorough search for secondary infections every time a non-erosive type of arthritisis found. This is especially important because immunosuppressive drugs arecontraindicated in animals with underlying infections. Joint involvement in this type of disorder is usually monarticular or pauciarticular, and has a predisposition for the carpal and tarsal joints. Since the organisms involved in theprimary disease process cannot be identified in the synovial membrane, it is likely thatthe joint disease is also of immune complex origin. A similar relationship between asterile arthritis and chronic infections in other parts of the body was recognized muchearlier in man (Coggeshall et al., 1941). 4.2.5.3. Non-deforming arthritis associated with other disorders 4.2.5.3.1. Systemic lupus erythematosus . A non-deforming polyarthritis is the most common presenting clinical feature of canine SLE. Like virtually all immune-mediated284 N.C. Pedersen / Veterinary Immunology and Immunopathology 69 (1999) 251-342arthritides, care must be taken to exclude underlying causes of disease, e.g., infections, drugs, neoplasia. A non-erosive polyarthritis has been observed in subacute bacterialendocarditis (SBE) in man and dogs, and indeed the entire syndrome of SBE can mimicSLE. Two dogs described by Bennett (1986) best document this point. Chronic bacterialendocarditis can lead to continuous low-grade damage to parenchymal organs, high levelsof circulating immune complexes, and a heightened responsiveness of the hosts immunesystem. In man and animals this may result in the production of numerous autoantibodies, including antinuclear antibody and rheumatoid factors. Antinuclear antibodies result from chronic nucleoprotein release and heightened immunologic responsiveness, andrheumatoid factors are made in response to persistent immune-complex production.This phenomenon is important, because if such animals are mistakenly diagnosed ashaving SLE or rheumatoid arthritis, they will be treated with immunosuppressive drugs,with potentially consequences. A pauci- or be an accompanying feature of immune-mediated meningitis, although signsreferable to joint inflammation are almost always masked by the signs of the meningitis.The exception is in Akita puppies (Dougherty et al., 1991); both meningitis and polyarthritis are clinically apparent. 4.2.5.3.3. Familial mediterranean fever . Familial Mediterranean Fever is a human disorder characterized by recurrent fever of unknown origin, renal amyloidosis, and evidence of peritonitis, pleuritis, and/or synovitis. A syndrome thought to be similar tofamilial Mediterranean fever has been described in Chinese sharpei dogs (Rivas et al.,1992). Whether or not the syndrome is the same as the human disorder remains to bedetermined. Diseased dogs showed elevated levels of IL-6 in serum andhypergammaglobulinemia when compared to normal controls. Affected dogs that weretwo years old or older frequently suffered from renal failure associated with amyloidosisand swollen joints. 4.2.5.3.4. Juvenile cellulitis and arthritis . Four of 15 dogs diagnosed with juvenile cellulitis (juvenile pyoderma, puppy strangles) had signs of joint pain in addition to thecharacteristic facial inflammation and submandibular lymphadenopathy (White et al.,1989). Synovial fluids from three of the four dogs with joint pain revealed suppurativearthritis and were negative for bacterial growth on culture. Concurrent treatment with antibiotics and prednisone was highly effective in curing both facial and joint lesions. 4.2.5.4. Non-deforming arthritis associated with neoplasia . A sterile polyarthritis has been observed in some dogs and cats with overt or latent neoplastic processes in otherparts of the body (Pedersen et al., 1976b; Bennett, 1986). As such, the signs of polyarthritis may precede the signs of cancer or may be a minor to major component of the overall disease syndrome. 4.2.5.5. Enteropathic arthritis . Enteropathic arthritis is frequently associated with disease like ulcerative colitis and regional enteritis of man. The cause of the arthritis is unknown,N.C. Pedersen / Veterinary Immunology and Immunopathology 69 (1999) 251-342 285but it is thought that either the bowel and joint disease share a common etiology, or antigenic products released into the blood from the inflamed bowel have some effect onthe synovium. Hepatopathic arthropathy, which has been seen in several dogs withchronic active hepatitis and cirrhosis, is also a type of enteropathic arthritis. In thisdisease, antigenic material from the bowel probably gains access to the generalbloodstream, because it is not being removed from the portal blood by thereticuloendothelial tissue of the liver. Polyarthritis in dogs with ulcerative colitis and more fulminating enterocolitis has been recognized (Pedersen et al., 1976b). In addition, a small percentage of the dogs withidiopathic polyarthritis have problems with flatulence, occasional vomiting, and eventualgastric torsion; the latter indicates Plasmacytic-lymphocytic gonitis . A synovitis is observed in 10% or less of dogs operated on for cranial cruciate ligament (CCL) rupture. This subclass of dogs tends to beyounger than the usual dog with CCL ruptures and they are often purebred animals ofmedium-sized breeds such as Rottweilers. It leads to pronounced joint laxity andinstability, often manifested by cruciate ligament damage and synovium isgrossly thickened, edematous, reddish-yellowish tinged. The synovial fluid is cloudy, less viscous, yellow tinged, and contains from 5000 to 20 000 white cells per ml, with 10-40% of these being neutrophils. Unlike other inflammatory joint diseases, the predominant cellis often a small lymphocyte. The fluid is sterile for known microorganisms. Radiographicchanges, when present, are minimal and include soft tissue swelling and periostealproliferative changes. Erosive changes are absent or slight. These features may relate tothe pre-existing instability due to ligament weakness. Synovial biopsies show an intenselymphocytic-plasmacytic infiltrate and synovial hypertrophy that is sometimes villous.Subchondral erosions are minimal or absent. The etiology of this disorder is unknown, and it is still uncertain whether the peculiar synovitis leads to the cruciate ligament laxity/rupture or whether it is merely a secondaryimmune reaction by the host to the degenerating ligament. In favor of the latter etiology,CCL reconstruction is often curative by itself in these dogs. Significantly increased levelsof serum anti-native collagen type II antibody, as assessed by ELISA, have also beenmeasured in dogs with diverse joint diseases such as rheumatoid arthritis, infectivearthritis, primary DJD and CCL rupture (Bari et al., 1989). In favor of the cruciate diseasebeing secondary to some immune disorder: 1. proper immunosuppressive drug therapy early in the course of the disease often renders affected animals sound; 2. the subset of dogs with this form of CCL rupture are different from the older, sedentary, overweight spayed female dogs that develop classical ligament degenera- tion; 3. breeds of dogs that suffer from this disorder tend to be the same breeds that are afflicted by other immunologic diseases; and 4. inflammation can sometimes be detected in joints other than the affected stifles. Regardless of the ultimate cause, it would be prudent to treat atypical cases of CCL rupture with inflammatory synovial fluids medically as early in the disease course as286 N.C. Pedersen / Veterinary Immunology and Immunopathology 69 (1999) 251-342possible, and to augment or substitute medical treatment with surgery in more advanced cases or in animals that fail to respond medically. Medical treatment would be the sameas for other immunologic arthritides. 4.2.5.7. Drug-induced arthritis . Drug-induced vasculitides, usually manifested by acute skin and joint involvement, are becoming increasingly more common in dogs, especiallyas the proportion of purebred animals increases (Cribb, 1989; Giger et al., 1985;Grondalen, 1987; Harvey, 1987). The most common drug hypersensitivity is tosulfonamides, although the authors have observed identical disease after the use ofpenicillins, erythromycin, lincomycin, and cephalosporins. Drug reactions involve the deposition of drug-antibody complexes around blood vessels in different areas of the body. The drug may act directly as an antigen or may combine with host proteins ashaptens to form neoantigens. Polyarthritis is only one feature of the disease syndrome; fever, lymphadenopathy, and various types of macular-papular or bullous type hemorrhagic rashes frequentlyaccompany the disease. Joint fluids contain large numbers of non-degenerativeneutrophils. The first sign of the allergic reaction tends to occur from 10 to 21 daysafter drug treatment is initiated for some other condition. This is the time period during which sensitization occurs. Alternatively, drug reactions may occur within hours of administering a drug that had been used safely in the past. Affected dogs become acutelyfebrile, stiff and sore, and develop a generalized rash. The rash can take several forms, butindividual lesions on the skin are clearly of a vascular origin with hemorrhagic blistering,focal necrosis with hemorrhage, severe lymphadenopathy, polymyositis, anemia, glomerulonephritis, focal retinitis,leukopenia, and thrombocytopenia. The diagnosis is readily apparent, providing theclinician is astute enough to connect drug treatment with the onset of an acute vasculitis syndrome involving primarily skin and joints. This linkage may be missed, especially if it is assumed that the condition at hand is merely an extension of the condition for whichthe treatment was prescribed. There is a rapid resolution of signs upon discontinuation ofdrug treatment, although whirlpool baths and glucocorticoids may be required to speedthe healing of the skin lesions. 4.2.5.8. Treatment of immune-mediated arthritides . The first imperative is to determine whether or not the arthritis is associated with some significant underlying disease process.When inciting diseases are present, treatment should be concentrated on the underlyingcause first and the immune arthritis second. The objective of therapy should be completeremission, which correlates with the disappearance of synovial fluid abnormalities andnot just a return to some perception of 'outward normalcy'. Allowing the joint disease toslowly simmer during inadequate treatment can lead to secondary DJD over a period of months or years. Moreover, accepting less than complete remission does the animal an unkindness, because even greater clinical improvement can be expected with totalcontrol. It is important to use synovial fluid analysis to determine when complete remission has been achieved. Dogs may return to near clinical normalcy on treatment, but yet stilldemonstrate mild synovial inflammation. If low-grade inflammation is allowed to persist,N.C. Pedersen / Veterinary Immunology and Immunopathology 69 (1999) 251-342 287DJD will gradually occur and complicate the overall clinical picture. It is prudent, therefore, to select several joints that initially showed inflammatory changes and toreexamine fluid from these joints periodically during drug therapy. A clinically acceptable reduction of joint inflammation can be achieved with glucocorticoids alone in about one-third of cases. A higher percentage can be treatedwith glucocorticoids alone if the dosage is kept high and the therapy continued over longperiods of time. The side-effects of such long-term high-dose therapy are so great, however, that combination drug therapy is preferable. If, during drug therapy, there is a drastic change in the clinical appearance of the lameness, immediate reevaluation of the status of the joint disease is imperative. Theauthors have seen dogs that developed severe septic arthritis months after being treatedfor immune-mediated arthritis when there was an undiagnosed underlying endocarditis orpyelonephritis. It is a grave mistake to reinstitute or intensify drug therapy on thepresumption that it is the same disorder. 4.2.6. Immune-mediated meningitis Immune-mediated meningitis is an increasingly common disorder of dogs. The condition has been also called periarteritis nodosa, and resembles Kawasaki syndrome ofhumans (Felsburg et al., 1992; Tipold et al., 1995). It is particularly common inadolescent or young adult Beagles, Pointers, Boxers, Akitas, Weimeraners, and BerneseMountain dogs. It is uncommon in mongrels. The severity and chronicity of disease variesamong the breeds. The clinical signs in Beagles, Pointers, Weimeraners, and Boxers consist of cyclic bouts of fever, severe neck pain and rigidity, reluctance to move, and depression (Albassam et al., 1989; Hayes et al., 1989; Poncelet and Balligand, 1993; Ruben et al., 1989; Snyder et al., 1995; Spencer and Greaves, 1987). Each attack lasts from 5 to 10days, with intervening periods of complete or partial normalcy lasting a week or more.Cerebral spinal fluid collected during an attack has an elevated protein and neutrophilcontent; fluid taken between attacks is normal. The causative lesion in Beagles, and inprobably in other breeds as well, is an arteritis of the meningeal vessels and occasionallyof other tissues as well, e.g., the synovium. The disease is often self-limiting over severalmonths; attacks become milder and of longer intervals between. Glucocorticoid therapy will help minimize the severity of attacks. A more severe form of immune-mediated meningitis is seen in young Bernese mountain dogs. The disease in the Bernese mountain dogs is somewhat cyclical, but thereis incomplete resolution in intervening periods. Cerebrospinal fluid abnormalitiesresemble those of the disease in these other breeds. The condition is less likely to be self-limiting than in the above breeds and often requires long-term high dose glucocorticoidtherapy to maintain the animals in a comfortable state. A syndrome of meningitis, usually associated with polyarthritis, is seen in Akitas as young as 12 weeks of age (Dougherty et al., 1991). The animals show severe, but somewhat cyclical, bouts of fever, depression, cervical pain and rigidity, and generalizedstiffness. Affected animals grow at a slower rate and often appear unthrifty. The conditionresponds poorly to glucocorticoid and combination immunosuppressive therapy, and mostanimals are euthanitized as early adults. A milder and more drug responsive form of the288 N.C. Pedersen / Veterinary Immunology and Immunopathology 69 (1999) 251-342disease is seen in older Akitas. The condition in older Akitas may be deposition of immune complexes . Goodpasture's disease of humans is manifested by immune-mediated glomerulonephritis, nephrotic syndrome, andpulmonary hemorrhage. The glomerular lesions are associated with the binding of anti-glomerular basement membrane antibodies to the glomerular basement membrane. Alinear type of antibody deposition is seen by IFA. Pulmonary lesions are associated with abreakdown of alveoli associated with the deposition of antibody in the alveolar basement membranes. A single dog with a condition that histologically and clinically resembled Goodpasture's disease has been recognized. 4.2.7.2. 'Lumpy-bumpy' deposition of immune complexes . Glomerulonephritis associated with granular or 'lumpy-bumpy' immune complex depositions is the most commonimmune complex disorder of animals. It exists in several histopathologic forms and iseither primary (idiopathic) or secondary in nature. The lesions result from irregulardeposition of immunoglobulin and complement in the subepithelial or subendothelial basement membranes. Lumpy-bumpy deposition is consistent withcirculating pre-formed immune complexes rather than in situ or anti-basement membranereacting antibodies. Glomerulonephritis is either the sole or primary manifestation (idiopathic glomer- ulonephritis), or is a secondary feature of some other immune-complex generatingdisorder. Dogs with secondary glomerulonephritis almost always present for signs of theiroverlying disease and the kidney problems are diagnosed secondarily. Glomerulonephritishas been described secondary to chronic infectious diseases, such as babesiosis (Wozniaket al., 1997), infectious canine hepatitis (Hervaas et al., 1997), dirofilariasis (Nakagaki etal., 1993), 1992; Poli et al.,1991), and bacterial endocarditis (Macdougall et al., 1986), and to non-infectious conditions such as chronic congenital portosystemic shunts (Tisdall et al., 1996) and congenital complement deficiency (Ameratunga et al., 1998; Blum et al., 1985). Dogs with idiopathic glomerulonephritis present mainly for signs of their kidney disease. As in humans, juvenile and adult-onset forms of the disease occur in dogs. Ajuvenile nephropathy has been reported in a Dalmatian (Dixon, 1997). A familialglomerulopathy, associated with membranoproliferative glomerulitis and interstitialnephritis, was observed in mountain et al., 1994; Reusch et al.,1994a, b). Dambach et al. (1997) described 49 cases of a rapidly progressive and highly fatal glomerulonephritis in dogs; affected animals were younger (5.6 \u00062.6 years) than other dogs with idiopathic glomerulonephritis (7.1 \u00063.6 years) and Labrador and Golden retrievers were five times or more over represented. The glomerular disease was mainlymembranoproliferative and was associated with subendothelial IgG, IgM and C3deposition. Although this disease has been linked to Lyme borreliosis exposure andvaccination, silver stains failed to show a strong relationship between spirochetes in thekidneys and lesions development.N.C. Pedersen / Veterinary Immunology and Immunopathology 69 (1999) 251-342 289Many dogs syndrome\u2014the hypoproteinemia, and peripheral edema. If the glomerular disease issignificant, there is also a concomitant loss of nephrons and signs of renal failure(elevated are often hypercoagulable (due to renal lossof anticoagulants) with elevated serum fibrinogens; sudden death due to thrombosis ofpulmonary arteries is a serious problem in such animals. Dogs with secondary glomerulonephritis almost always present with signs of their overlying illnesses and the glomerular disease is detected as an incidental finding during the clinical work-up orat post-mortem examination. The diagnosis of glomerulonephritis is made on the basis of clinical signs (weight loss, peripheral edema polyuria/polydypsia) and laboratory findings (hypoproteinemia andhyperproteinuria), and confirmed on renal biopsy. Glomerular changes can be classifiedin most cases by conventional light microscopy and the pattern of immune complexdeposition determined by immunofluorescene or immunoperoxidase staining. All of the WHO human categories of glomerular disease have been observed in dogs, i.e., focal, diffuse mesangial proliferative, diffuse endocapillary proliferative, al.,1986). Immune complexes consist of IgG, IgM (Minkus et al., 1994), IgA (Harris et al.,1993; Miyauchi et al., 1992), or combinations of the three, and complement. IgG and C3are more apt to be associated with dense deposits, while IgA and IgM are observed inanimals with dense or minimal deposits (Koeman et al., 1987). Membranous andmesangial proliferative changes vary in severity, and in exceptional cases, lesions are unapparent upon light microscopic examination and may even be minimal when viewed by electron microscopy (Vilafranca et al., 1993). These latter dogs have a conditionanalogous to 'minimal change disease' of humans. If there is an overlying or underlying disease condition, the emphasis should be placed on treating that disease. There is some debate on whether dogs with GN should be treatedconservatively with low protein diet and blood pressure control (Lulich et al., 1996), orvigorously with the addition of immunosuppressive drugs. Conservative therapy is oftenfavored because of the relatively high incidence (about 20%) of spontaneous remission (Biewenga and Gruys, 1986), and to the poor response and side-effects of prolonged immunosuppressive drug therapy. Cyclosporine treatment was found to offer noimprovement over non-treated animals in treatment of glomerulonephritis and wasassociated with a number of side-effects (Vaden et al., 1995). There is no question thatsome dogs, especially younger animals with minimal glomerular changes and acuteonset nephrotic syndrome, will self-cure after several months of conservative treatment(diet change with or without glucocorticoids). However, the disease in other dogs will notself-cure and vigorous treatment will slow the course of renal disease. Glucocorticoids alone are usually not effective, and combination therapy with glucocorticoids and cytotoxic drugs such as cyclophosphamide or azathioprine is required. Unfortunately,most dogs with glomerulonephritis present late in their disease course when treatment isminimally effective. The mean survival of one large group of dogs with glomerulardisease (glomerulonephritis and renal amyloidosis) was 28 days (Cook and Cowgill,1996).290 N.C. Pedersen / Veterinary Immunology and Immunopathology 69 (1999) 251-3424.2.7.3. Renal amyloidosis . Amyloidosis is technically not an immune complex disease, and does not fit into the original Gel and Coomb's classification scheme. Amyloidosisoccurs under the same conditions as immune-mediated glomerulonephritis. It isidiopathic or secondary to chronic antigen stimulating diseases, chronic inflammatorydiseases, chronic infectious diseases (MacIntire et al., 1997), other immune diseases suchas rheumatoid arthritis or juvenile polyarteritis (Snyder et al., 1995), dermatomyositis(Hargis et al., 1989), congenital complement deficiency (Blum et al., 1985), neoplasia (Geisel et al., 1990; Platz et al., 1997), and senility (Johnson et al., 1992; Shimada et al., 1991, 1992; Uchida et al., 1990, 1991). Genetics may play an important role in idiopathicamyloidosis; it has been described in Chinese shar pei dogs (DiBartola et al., 1990;Dubuis et al., 1998; 1994; Rivas et al., 1993), Beagles (Bowles and Mosier,1992), and in English Foxhounds (Mason and Day, 1996). Amyloid is a complex b-pleated protein and several different serum components can contribute to its make-up (Sellar et al., 1991). In most cases, amyloid consists mainly ofreaggregations of the variable regions of immunoglobulin light chains. Conditions associated with an increased production and catabolism of immunoglobulin, therefore, are most likely to be associated with this form of amyloid (amyloid-light chain or AL).How the intact immunoglobulin light chains are converted into amyloid fibrils is notknown, but it may involve catabolism of immunoglobulin or immunoglobulin subunits bymacrophages. Amyloid can also be made up of non-immunoglobulin proteins, so-calledamyloid of unknown origin or amyloid A (AA). A small proportion of AL or AA consistsof a plasma component related to a1 globulin. Amyloidosis in man and animals has been classified as either primary (idiopathic) or secondary to chronic infectious diseases, immunologic diseases, neoplasia, or senility. There is a tendency, however, to classify amyloidosis in man according to the chemicalcomposition of the amyloid. The following classification has been used in man, and appears to be similar in animals: Type Clinical form Site of deposition Chemical type of Fibril Familial Liver, spleen, kidneys, adrenalsAA Generalized Idiopathic, plasma cell dyscrasia,secondary to chronicinfections andinflammationsMany organs, (amyloid-dermal) Heart, brain AS c,A S b Amyloidosis in dogs usually involves the kidneys; beta amyloidosis of the brain in aged dogs has been described less commonly (Weegiel et al., 1996). Renal amyloidosis isassociated with heavy proteinuria, nephrotic syndrome, and eventually renal failure. LikeN.C. Pedersen / Veterinary Immunology and Immunopathology 69 (1999) 251-342 291glomerulonephritis, primary forms of renal amyloidosis present mainly with nephrotic syndrome while secondary forms are often associated with underlying or overlyingdisease syndromes. Of the various glomerulopathies in dogs, amyloidosis andmembranous glomerulonephritis are the most likely to be associated nephroticsyndrome, azotemia, hypercoagulation and thrombotic disorders (Biewenga and Gruys,1986; Cook and Cowgill, 1996). If secondary, and the primary cause can be corrected, some reversal of signs may occur. Several dogs with idiopathic renal amyloidosis have been treated with DMSO orally; the substance is taken into the blood and secreted in the kidneys. The objective is to dissolveamyloid deposits and to prevent further amyloid deposition (Spyridakis et al., 1986).However, it is hard to get animals to ingest sufficient quantities and there is a heavy garlicodor. DMSO treatment is not always effective and appears to prolong survival rather thancuring the disease. Overall, renal amyloidisis in dogs carries a poor prognosis with amean survival time of less than one month (Cook and Cowgill, 1996). 4.2.8. Dermatomyositis Dermatomyositis has crosses (Hargis et al., 1986). Cutaneous, muscular and vascular lesions were noted injuvenile to adult animals. Gross lesions were most severe on the head and distalextremities. Microscopic lesions included myositis in the esophageal musculature;arteritis in skin, muscle, bladder and spermatic cord; ofperipheral nodes; thyroiditis. 5. Type IV reactions (cell-mediated immunity) 5.1. Mechanism of type IV immune reactions Cell-mediated immunity is mediated by two cell types, lymphocytes and macrophages. It is an evolutionary step between phagocytosis and humoral immunity. Natural killer(NK) cells appeared first, followed thereafter by specific thymus-derived lymphocytes (T-cells). Cell-mediated immunity functions mainly against body cells that have beenrendered foreign, either by malignant transformation or from intracellular microorgan-isms, or against invasion by cells from other individuals of the same (allogeneic cells) ordifferent (xenogenic) species. NK cells are a subpopulation of lymphocytes that bear neither T- or B-cell markers, hence the alternative name of 'null cells'. NK cell activity rests within the large granularpopulation of blood lymphocytes. NK cells have primitive receptors on their surface thatcan non-specifically identify many types of antigenically altered host cells (malignantcells, infected cells). Because a single NK cell can recognize a wide spectrum ofabnormal cells, NK cell immunity is not antigen specific. Therefore, NK cell activity isconsidered to be an integral part of innate, rather than adaptive, immunity. Most in vitroassay procedures for NK cell activity involve killing of tumor cell targets. NK cells recognize foreign or altered cells during their wanderings through the body; the same cell being capable of recognizing a wide range of abnormal cells. NK cells touch membranes292 N.C. Pedersen / Veterinary Immunology and Immunopathology 69 (1999) 251-342of abnormal cells and kill them by releasing specific lymphokines. NK cell-mediated killing can be enhanced by antibodies specific for abnormal surface antigens onmalignant or antigenically altered cells, a process known as antibody dependent cellularcytotoxicity (ADCC). This is an example of how a more primitive form of immunity canbe upgraded by the subsequent evolution of antigen specific humoral immunity. T-cells,which evolved for cell-mediated immunity, were also used later for control and regulationof B-cell immunity. T-cell-mediated immunity is mediated by two subclasses of cells, those that bear the CD4 cell surface antigen and those that possess the CD8 cell surface antigen. The CD4 \u0087 T-cells 'help' B-cells produce antibody and are often referred to as helper cells. They arealso important for the generation and maintenance of immunologic memory. CD8 \u0087T- cells function to suppress B-cell activity and are called suppressor cells. These cells arealso important as effectors of adaptive cell-mediated immunity. T-cells have evolvedimmunoglobulin-like receptors on their surfaces. Unlike NK cells, each T-cell possessreceptors to a single antigenic epitope. Therefore, hundreds of thousands of antigen specific T-cell subpopulations exist in the body. B-cell (humoral) immunity first appeared in higher fish and is a natural evolutionary step from T-cell immunity. In T-cell immunity,immunoglobulin-like receptors are firmly anchored to the cell surface, while in B-cellimmunity, the 'receptors' are also excreted free into the surrounding body fluids asantibodies. T-cell-mediated cytotoxicity is triggered when cell surface antigens on either a foreign (allogeneic, xenogeneic) or altered host cell is recognized by its corresponding antigenspecific T-cell. Initial recognition leads to the elaboration of numerous lymphokines/ cytokines. Some of these lymphokines may have non-specific anti-microbial activity, such as interferons. Other cytokines induce a clonal expansion of a subpopulation of T-cells that bear the identical antigen receptor. Some of these proliferating T-cells becomeantigen-specific effector or killer cells. T-effector cells can recognize and kill theabnormal cells by bringing themselves into intimate contact and releasing cytotoxiclymphokines. Because macrophages are a favorite reservoir for microbial growth oringest organisms as part of their phagocytic function, they are an important target for T-cell responses. T-effector cells can either kill infected macrophages directly, activate surrounding macrophages to assist in direct cell killing, or 'instruct' the macrophage to activate itself and to destroy any microbes that it might contain. The latter two processesare most important for intracellular infection with viruses, while the latter is moreimportant for macrophages containing complex microbes such as bacteria, protozoa,parasites or fungi. Host cells are rendered foreign when specific foreign antigens are elaborated on their surfaces, and are thus rendered targets for attack by specific T-cells and activatedmacrophages. Malignant cells may express new antigens on their surface; these antigens may be unique to the body or were expressed only during embryogenesis and prior to the time that self-tolerance is induced. Cells that are infected with microbes are also renderedforeign. Foreign proteins produced within the cells by the microbe are transported to thecell surface and expressed on the major histocompatibility complex-I (MHC-I). Host cellsmay also be rendered foreign when their surface antigens are chemically altered, as in thecase of contact hypersensitivities to plastics, drugs, or other substances. In rare cases,N.C. Pedersen / Veterinary Immunology and Immunopathology 69 (1999) 251-342 293normal cells can come under attack by killer T-cells by mechanisms that are identical to those described for autoantibody responses (Wucherpfennig et al., 1995). These variousmechanisms are amply illustrated by the number and variety of immune disorders of dogsthat have a type IV immune etiology. 5.2. Diseases involving type IV reactions5.2.1. Delayed hypersensitivity reactions of skin Flea allergic dermatitis is interesting in that immediate, intermediate and delayed hypersensitivity reactions can occur in the same animal. In fact, an evolution from onetype of immunity to the other was demonstrated in animals almost four decades ago(Benjamini et al., 1961). Immediate reactions are characterized by reactions that appearwithin 30 min of antigenic challenge, whereas delayed hypersensitivity reactions take 48-72 h to reach peak intensity. The former reaction is characterized by edema, neutrophil,and eosinophil infiltrate, the latter by inflammation and mononuclear cell (Lymphocyte, macrophage, plasma cell) infiltrate. Poison oak and poison ivy are classic examples of delayed hypersensitivity reactions in humans. The oils of these plants chemically combine with epidermal proteins and resultin the formation of neoantigens. Sensitization of people to these altered proteins occursafter the initial exposure. Subsequent exposures lead to a rapid influx of lymphocytes andmacrophages into the sensitized skin. The resulting delayed hypersensitivity reaction isessentially an attempt to reject ones own skin. Fortunately, dogs are not sensitive to mostplant sensitizers. Analogs of poison oak and ivy are observed in dogs in the case muzzle hypersensitivities associated with eating out of plastic food dishes. Resins present in some plastics will leach into the food and bind with the skin on the muzzle. 5.2.2. Infection granulomas Granulomatous reactions occurring in response to a number of intracellular infectious agents (tuberculosis, coccidioidomycosis, Histoplasmosis, etc.) are essentially delayed-type hypersensitivity reactions. They result, however, from only partial cellular immunity.Complete cellular immunity results in effective activation of macrophages anddestruction or inactivation of intracellular organisms. A complete failure of cellular immunity leads to widespread dissemination of organisms with little attempt on the host to contain the infection. In cases of partial cellular immunity, containment of theorganism is incomplete and is manifested by granuloma formation. 5.2.3. Juvenile pyoderma Juvenile pyoderma is a pronounced submandibular and cervical lymphadenopathy with edema and pustule formation of the muzzle (White et al., 1989). It occurs exclusively inpuppies, especially of Brittany Spaniels, Dachshunds and Pointer breeds. Juvenilepyoderma is usually associated with a facial staphylococcal pyoderma. However, the condition seems to result from an inappropriate cellular immune response to the staphylococcal infection. It is treated with both antibiotics and prednisolone. As the dogsget older, their immune responses become more normal and such flamboyant responsesare not seen.294 N.C. Pedersen / Veterinary Immunology and Immunopathology 69 (1999) 251-3425.2.4. Type IV diseases of the joints 5.2.4.1. Canine rheumatoid arthritis . Rheumatoid arthritis is one of the most common and serious immune diseases of humans. It occurs in Juvenile and adult-onset forms. The precise etiology is unknown, but the disease process is of a type IV nature and is directed against antigens within the joint. Whether these antigens are of host origin, orto some yet unknown agent, is unknown. The dense mixed-inflammatory reaction iscentered in the synovial membrane and the subchondral bone. Cartilage is underminedby subchondral inflammation and overlain by a pannus of granulation tissue emanatingfrom points of synovial attachment. The net effect is a progressive destruction ofcartilage starting at the joint margins; this ultimately leads to joint instability, subluxation,and luxation. The synovial membrane undergoes a characteristic villus hyperplasia with dense infiltrates of plasma cells and lymphocytes. Lymphocytes in the infiltrate, in the human disease, result from an almost clonal expansion of selected CD4 \u0087T- cells which are autoreactive and lack functionally important CD28 surface markers(Martens et al., 1997). However, the role of these cells in the pathogenesis or etiology ofhuman RA is unknown (Breedveld, 1998). The inflammatory changes observed in RAappear to be cytokine produced by macrophage/monocytes and T-cells (Smolen al.,1996). Rheumatoid are hallmarks of human RA. Rheumatoid factors are auto- antibodies, usually IgM, that are reactive against immune complexed Ig. Rheumatoid factors are present at high titer in about 70% of humans with RA, but are also detected inpatients with a wide range of chronic infections. Rheumatoid factor is not pathogenic initself, because passive transfer of high titered serum does not induce arthritis. It ispossible, however, that immune complexes containing rheumatoid factor contribute to thedisease by a type III mechanism. Canine rheumatoid arthritis is a well-documented clinical entity (Halliwell et al., 1972; Liu et al., 1969; Newton et al., 1976; Pedersen et al., 1976a), although uncommon compared to the non-erosive arthritides. The incidence has been approximately two per 25 000 dogs examined at the authors' hospital, which is significantly less than thefrequency of RA in people. This disorder occurs mainly in small or toy breeds of dogs asyoung as eight months and as old as eight years of age. Although rheumatoid arthritis hasbeen categorized as an erosive polyarthritis in this discussion, clinicians in some parts ofthe world often lump non-erosive polyarthritis with rheumatoid arthritis. In the authors'opinion, this is unjustified because of clear histopathologic, radiographic, and clinicaldifferences between the two types of diseases. Canine rheumatoid arthritis is manifested initially as a shifting lameness with soft tissue swelling around involved joints. Within several weeks or months, the diseaselocalizes in particular joints and characteristic radiographic signs develop. Jointinvolvement is more severe in the carpal and tarsal joints, although in individual dogs,the elbow, stifle, shoulder, and hip joints may show similar radiographic signs.Involvement of the apophyseal joints and costovertebral articulations rarely progresses tothe point of causing radiographic changes. In exceptional cases, however, involvement ofthe vertebral articulations can only occur. The disease is often accompanied by fever, malaise, anorexia, and lymphadenopathy in the earlier stages. Renal amyloidosis can be aN.C. Pedersen / Veterinary Immunology and Immunopathology 69 (1999) 251-342 295complication of long-standing disease that is inadequately controlled (Colbatzky et al., 1991). The earliest radiographic changes consist of soft tissue swelling and loss of trabecular bone density in the area of the joint. Lucent cyst-like areas are frequently seen in thesubchondral bone. The prominent lesion is a progressive destruction of subchondralbone in the more central areas as well as marginally at the attachment of the synovium(Pedersen et al., 1976b). Both narrowing and widening of the joint spaces are identified radiographically as a result of cartilage erosion and destruction of subchondral bone. Subluxation, luxation, and deformation occur most frequently in the carpal,tarsal, and phalangeal joints and occasionally in the elbow and stifle joints. Fibrousankylosis can occur in advanced cases, particularly in the intercarpal and intertarsal jointspace. Hemograms are either normal or reflect the generalized inflammatory process with a leukocytosis, neutrophilia, and hyperfibrinogenemia (Pedersen et al., 1976b). Serumelectrophoresis will often show hypoalbuminemia and variable elevation in a2- and g- globulins. Rheumatoid factors, i.e., autoantibodies against sterically altered (e.g., immune complexed) antibodies, are the hallmark of human rheumatoid arthritis; they are presentat high titer in about three-fourths of affected people. Rheumatoid factors probably servea function in cross-linking immune complexes and aiding in their clearance byphagocytes. They are detectable, therefore, in many diseases where chronic immunecomplexing is occurring. Although of definite value in the diagnosis of humanrheumatoid arthritis, the value of rheumatoid factor tests in canine rheumatoid arthritis isless certain. Some veterinary researchers have been able to detect rheumatoid factors in a majority of affected dogs, but in only a small proportion of normal dogs and animals with other conditions (Halliwell et al., 1989; Bennett and Kirkham, 1987). In one study,however, rheumatoid factors were detected at comparatively low titer and in only aboutone quarter of the cases of canine rheumatoid arthritis (Pedersen et al., 1976b). Recentstudies have also confirmed that rheumatoid factors are present at only low titer and inonly about one-fourth of dogs with rheumatoid arthritis; they are also present at similartiter and incidence in unclassified polyarthritis, heartworm disease, pyometra,leishmaniasis and systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) (Chabanne et al., 1993; Nielsen, 1992). Antinuclear antibodies are sometimes detected in dogs with rheumatoid arthritis, but not as frequently as in SLE. Synovial fluid changes are indicative of an inflammatory synovitis, with an elevated total cell count, a high proportion of neutrophils in the synovial fluid cell population anda variable decrease in the quality of the mucin clot. Ragocytes (neutrophils that haveingested immune complexes), as described in human rheumatoid arthritis, are not usuallyseen. A characteristic finding in canine rheumatoid arthritis is the presence in synovialfluid of mononuclear cells containing IgG, with only occasional cells containing C3 protein (Pedersen et al., 1976b). These mononuclear cells may be producing the immunoglobulin or ingesting it from the synovial fluid. The characteristic pathologic lesions consist of a villous hyperplasia of the synovial membrane and lymphoid and plasma cell infiltrates in the synovium. Infiltration cellsdestroy articular cartilage starting at the margins of the joint. A pannus of granulationtissue also invades the surface of the cartilage. In the central regions of the joint, cartilage296 N.C. Pedersen / Veterinary Immunology and Immunopathology 69 (1999) 251-342destruction is caused by a pannus arising from granulation tissue in the underlying marrow cavity. Ankylosis in advanced lesions is not uncommon in the intercarpal andintertarsal joints. The dense lymphoid and plasma cell infiltrate in the synovium and thedestruction of articular cartilage differentiate rheumatoid arthritis from the synovitis seenin the non-erosive types of arthritis. The presence of large numbers of lymphocytes andplasma cells in the synovium suggest the presence of a local antigenic stimulus and a typeIV or delayed-type hypersensitivity reaction; the nature of the antigen that is evoking this reaction is unknown. Canine rheumatoid arthritis responds only temporarily to systemic corticosteroids. Aspirin has no appreciable therapeutic benefits in the author's hands, probably becausethe disease is much more severe and rapidly progressive in dogs than in man. If thecondition is recognized before severe joint damage occurs, it can usually be arrested withcombination immunosuppressive drug therapy. This type of therapy will be covered indetail in the discussion of drug therapy of immune-mediated arthritides. In dogs withadvanced deformities, immunosuppressive drug therapy may have to be combined with arthrodesis of selected joints. Arthrodesis is not warranted if the disease process cannot first be successfully halted with drug therapy. 5.2.4.2. Polyarthritis of greyhounds . A semi-erosive polyarthritis in in different parts of the world (Castelli, 1969; Huxtable and Davis, 1976; Woodard et al.,1991). Disease appears in animals from 3 to 30 months of age and most frequently attacksthe proximal interphalangeal, carpal, tarsal, elbow, and stifle joints. The shoulder, hip andatlanto-occipital joints are less frequently involved. A tenosynovitis may be anaccompanying feature. The synovial membrane is edematous and hyperemic in theearly course of the disease, and may be covered with a fine layer of fibrin. The synovialfluid is cloudy and yellowish, and often contains fibrin tags. In later stages, a lymphocyte and plasma cell infiltrate is seen in the synovial lining. Peripheral lymph nodes are enlarged and hyperactive. Pannus formation and marginal subchondral erosions are seento a limited extent. Destruction of articular cartilage occurs in some joints but often is notassociated with pannus formation. Gross deformities and radiographic changes are not asapparent as those seen in canine rheumatoid arthritis but appear more pronounced thanthose described for non-erosive joint disease. Mycoplasmal and bacterial isolations have usually been unsuccessful and dogs are serologically negative for Erysipelothrix and Chlamydia . However, Mycoplasma spumans has been isolated from a young greyhound with polyarthritis (294). The significance of this single isolate from a polyarthritis of greyhounds remains to bedetermined. 5.2.5. Glandular diseases involving type IV immunity A number of glandular disorders of man and animals appear to be involved with immune phenomena, and it is not always clear whether immunologic abnormalities are acause or effect. Lymphocytic and type Idiabetes mellitus are endocrine disorders that are related in some way to autoimmunity in dogs (Greco and Harpold, 1994). Immune phenomena are sicca, fistulae, is undoubtedly the most common endocrine disorder of dogs. The disorder is caused, in equal proportion, bylymphocytic/plasmacytic thyroiditis or idiopathic atrophy (Kemppainen and Clark,1994). The former is analogous to Hashimoto's thyroiditis of man and appears to be ofautoimmune origin. Thyroid atrophy may not be a separate entity, but rather an end stageof the thyroiditis; 8/8 hypothyroid dogs in one thyroiditis onbiopsy (Nachreiner et al., 1998). Thyroiditis was also shown to progress to severe atrophy in a study of hypothyroid Beagles (Benjamin et al., 1996). As in humans, hypothyroidism underlies a significant proportion of other immune disorders in dogs, and is seenoverwhelmingly in purebreds. The breeds the breeds that suffer from a range of immune disorders. In addition to the common finding of lymphocytic infiltrate, fibrosis and atrophy, many dogs with hypothyroidism will have detectable anti-thyroid antibodies. In humanHashimoto's disease, these antibodies are usually against thyroid peroxidase; however, this does not appear to be the case in dogs (Thacker et al., 1995). Rather, dogs with lymphocytic thyroiditis develop antibodies to T3, T4 and thyroglobulin to varyingdegrees (Nachreiner et al., predominantly inIgG1, IgG3 and IgG4 subclasses (Day, 1996a, b, c). Clinical signs of hypothyroidism in affected dogs are, in order of frequency, obesity, seborrhea, alopecia, weakness, lethargy, bradycardia, Jaggy and Oliver, 1994) and reproductivefailure (Johnson, 1994) have also been associated with hypothyroidism in dogs. The diagnosis of thyroiditis and hypothyroidism should take into account clinical signs, breed predisposition, and evidence of decreased levels of triiodothyronine (T3) and thyroxine(T4), increased levels of TSH, and the presence of antibodies to T3, T4 and thyoglobulin.Some clinical researchers feel that post-TSH stimulation levels of T4 are the single mostdiagnostic test (Jaggy and Oliver, 1994). The presence of autoantibodies to T3 and T4cause serum T3 and T4 appear falsely high; however, free T4 is non-detectable when measured with a dialysis assay (Kemppainen et al., 1996). Comparativestudies of several tests demonstrated that both serum free T4 and TSH concentrations should be used in reaching a diagnosis; although free T4 tests were highly sensitive, greater specificity was obtained by combining the two assays (Peterson et al., 1997). TheTSH test, although very specific, lacks sensitivity; about one-fourth of hypothyroiddogs will have values in the normal reference range. Antibody assays for thyroglobulinhave also been found to be very sensitive and specific in diagnosing dogs withlymphocytic thyroiditis, when compared to antibody tests for T3 and/or T4 (Nachreineret al., 1998). Dogs with hypothyroidism are usually treated with L-thyroxine, which usually brings about resolution of all clinical signs of the disease. 5.2.5.2. Parathyroiditis and hypoparathyroidism . Parathyroid gland biopsies taken from dogs with acquired hypoparathyroidism often demonstrate changes similar to thoseobserved in dogs thyroid and adrenal glands of dogs with hypothyroidism and Addison's disease.298 N.C. Pedersen / Veterinary Adrenalitis and in dogs and hypoadrenocorticoism (Sadek and Schaer,1996). The disease occurs more often in purebreds with a distinct predisposition toStandard poodles and Leonbergers (Smallwood and Barsanti, 1995). The ofchoice is therapy, especially desoxycorticosterone pivalate (Kintzerand syndrome . Multiple endocrine disorders of immune nature have been described in dogs. Addison's disease associated with megaesophagus, similar toAllgrove's syndrome of people, has been described in a German shepherd dog (Fritzen et al., 1996). A Boxer dog with both hypothyroidism and Addison's disease has also been reported (Kooistra et al., 1995). Two of four Leonbergers with hypoadrenocorticoismwere also found to be hypothyroid (Smallwood and Barsanti, 1995). The combination ofadrenal- and thyroid-insufficiency is known as type II polyglandular autoimmunity orSchmidt's syndrome in humans. 5.2.5.5. Insulin dependent Type I diabetes mellitus . Insulin dependent Type I diabetes mellitus of humans is a polygenic autoimmune disease characterized by infiltration of theislets of Langerhans with activated lymphocytes and the production of islet cellantibodies (Elie and Hoenig, 1995). Type I diabetes mellitus is also a common disease indogs and may be a spontaneously occurring model of the human disorder (Greco and refers to corneal infections that occur secondary to inadequate tear formation. The ultimate cause is disease of the lacrimal glands, either because of canine distemper virus infection, radiation damage, drugs reactions (Majeed et al., 1987), or immune-reactions. An immune-mediated lacrimal gland inflammation of atype IV nature occurs frequently in dogs, most often in purebreds and with someselectivity towards Cocker spaniels. The latter condition in dogs is sometimes referred toas Sjo \u00a8gren's syndrome, a human disorder associated with immune destruction of salivary glands and a rheumatoid-like arthritis. The application of this term to the canine conditionis premature. The prognosis for keratitis sicca depends on the underlying cause. Animals on chronic drug therapy, especially sulfas, for other conditions should have their medications discontinued; however, permanent damage may have already occurred. Frequentapplications of artificial tears and topical antibiotics is usually required as long as tearproduction is inadequate. Opportunistic fungal infections must be considered in caseswith infections that do not respond to antibiotics (Smedes et al., 1992). In the case ofimmune-mediated disease, which is the most common cause of keratitis sicca in dogs, thetreatment of choice is cyclosporine eye drops, which brings about rapid remission in amajority of cases. 5.2.5.7. Sebaceous adenitis . Sebaceous adenitis is a disease recognized predominantly in Akitas and Standard Poodles (White et al., 1995). The disease is manifested by scaling,alopecia and secondary pyoderma. The target of the disorder are the sebaceous glands andN.C. Pedersen / Veterinary Immunology and Immunopathology 69 (1999) 251-342 299the inflammation is mainly of the lymphocytic/plasmacytic type. Earlier reports of the disease describe the use isotretinoin or etretinate; about one-half of the dogs had a 50% orgreater improvement (White et al., 1995). The treatment of choice, however, appears tobe leflunomide in sweat glands, leading to severe perianal fistulae, occurs predominantly in GermanShepherd Dogs, and to a lesser degree, Irish Setters (Killingsworth et al., 1988). Theincidence is higher in males than females and is greater in intact as compared to neuteredanimals. The perianal abnormalities have been associated with histological evidence of colitis as well (Harkin et al., 1996). Perianal lesions vary greatly, even in the same dog, in degrees of fibrosis, severity of inflammatory response and depth of sinus tracts(Killingsworth et al., 1988). Lesions tend to be in the zona cutanea, and hidradenitis withformation of epithelial-lined sinus tracts is apparent in over one-half of the biopsiesexamined. In another study dealing with anatomic predisposition, the only predisposingcause between German shepherds and other non-affected breeds was in the greaternumber of apocrine sweat glands in the zona cuneata (Budsberg et al., 1985). Secondarybacterial infection, with a number of different bacteria, is inevitably present (Killingsworth et al., 1988). Before the immunologic nature of the disease was discovered, the treatment of choice was often surgical excision of the fistulous tissues, or Glucocorticoids and special diets(Ellison, 1995; Harkin et 1996; Holt, 1985; Viehoff and van Slujis, 1993). Theaccepted treatment is now (Matthews and Sukhiani, 1997; Matthews et al.,1997). 5.2.6. VKH syndrome V ogt-Koyanagi-Harada syndrome is a specific genetic disorder manifested by bilateral uveitis, meningitis and depigmenting skin lesions, which was first described in humans of Japanese extraction. The underlying immunologic basis appears to be a cell-mediatedimmune attack against melanotic tissues (Nakamura et al., 1996; Norose and Yano, 1996;Okada et al., 1996; Rao, 1997), possibly through reaction to the MART-1/Melan-A(Sugita et al., 1996). A VKH-like syndrome has been described in Akita dogs (Reusch etal., Malamutes, Samoyeds and Chows.Although the lesions of the canine disease bear a superficial resemblance to VKH ofpeople, it remains to be proven that the syndrome in dogs is the same. The eyes are much less likely to be involved in dogs than the skin, while the opposite is true in man. CNS signs are also not seen in dogs with VKH-like disease, but this may be due to the absenceof melanocytes in the meninges of dogs compared to people. To further confuse the issue,many of these same breeds may have skin disease that superficially resembles VKH, buton closer examination and testing, the lesions are actually caused by pemphigusfoliaceous. Human VKH can be strongly linked to certain HLA-types (-DR1 and -DR4);the exact predisposing HLA types differing somewhat according to the race under study(Arellanes-Garcia et al., 1998; Goldberg et al., 1998; Islam et al., 1994; Shindo et al., 1994; Weisz et al., 1995). The strong breed predisposition in dogs parallels the strong ethnic and HLA type predilection in people.300 N.C. Pedersen / Veterinary Immunology and Immunopathology 69 (1999) 251-3425.2.7. Type IV immune diseases 1986),characterized a heterogenous inflammatory infiltrate MHC class II positivemacrophages and CD3 positive lymphocytes (Kipar et 1998). Dogs with GME tend tohave neurologic signs referable to the head (lethargy, nuchal rigidity, anorexia), whichprogress to caudal fossal abnormalities such as dementia, tetraparesis and profoundalterations in consciousness (Sarfaty et al., 1986). The diagnosis is based on the clinical signs and markedly elevated CSF protein levels and white cell counts; CSF cells consist predominantly of lymphocytes with an admixtureof neutrophils (Bailey and Higgins, 1986). Dogs with this disorder respond well tocombination therapy with glucocorticoids and leflunomide (Gregory et al., 1998). Thenature of the lesions and response to immunosuppressive drug therapy suggest that thedisorder is due to a type IV autoimmune reaction. 5.2.7.2. Old dog encephalitis . Old dog encephalitis, or delayed-onset canine distemper virus (CDV) encephalitis, results from cellular immunity directed against virus thatpersists in the brain long after the initial immune stage of infection. The CDV can be ofwild- or vaccine-type (Evans et al., 1991), but is probably mutated in some manner (Shapsak et al., 1987; Tobler and Imagawa, 1984). The condition is analogous to subacute sclerosing panencephalitis (SPE) of humans, a disorder associated with the persistence ofa genetically defective measles virus in the brain. It is not surprising that CDV and humanmeasles virus are closely related members of the genus Morbillavirus . The lesions of old dog encephalitis are more glial proliferative, diffuse, and spare the cerebellum, whilelesions of classic CDV encephalomyelitis tend to be focal, necrotizing, and moreconcentrated in the cerebellum, brain stem and spine (Vandevelde et al., 1980). Old dog encephalitis is a slowly progressive encephalitis that occurs in adult, vaccinated dogs, and is a differential in other types of chronic encephalitides such as GME. Signs are usually significant, although a mild encephalitis with the predominantsign being a loss of smell has been reported in a Beagle (Simpson and Myers, 1987).Dogs with delayed-onset CDV encephalitis, unlike animals with acute demyelinatingCDV encephalomyelitis, have high levels of CDV antibodies in their cerebral spinal fluid,indicating an active local immune response (Johnson et al., 1988). These antibodies havebeen shown to be directed solely to the M protein of CDV in 2/5 cases, which is thepattern observed in the homologous measles virus-induced SPE of humans; the remaining dogs demonstrated antibodies to nucleocapsid and phosoprotein antigens as well (Rima et al., 1987). 5.2.8. Chronic active hepatitis Six types of chronic hepatitis have been described in dogs: 1. chronic active hepatitis; 2. chronic persistent hepatitis;N.C. Pedersen / Veterinary Immunology and 69 (1999) cholangiohepatitis; and6. miscellaneous secondary hepatitis (Fuentealba et al., 1997). About one-third of all of these cases are of the chronic active type. Chronic active hepatitis occurs most commonly in Doberman pinschers and is characterized by inflammation and scar tissue formation around branches of small hepatic veins and apoptosis of hepatocytes in zone 3 (Thornburg, 1998). The inflammatory reactionconsists predominantly of macrophages, lymphocytes, and plasma cells, indicating a typeIV immune reaction. The exact etiology of this condition is unknown, but the strong breedpredisposition tends to support autoimmunity. However, autoimmunity was suspected tobe the cause of virtually all chronic active hepatitis in people before hepatitis B, C, D andG virus infections and a number of therapeutic drugs were a demonstrated as causalagents (Desmet, 1997). The disease in Dobermans is more common in females and the usual age of onset of signs is 2-8 years. However, biopsy studies indicate that actual lesions may be present forup to five years before the condition becomes clinical (Speeti et al., 1998). Clinical signsinclude weight loss, atrophy and other irregularities of the liver parenchyma onultrasonography, elevated liver enzymes, and sometimes jaundice. Corticosteroid therapymay be beneficial to some affected dogs (Dill-Macky, 1995). 6. Paraproteinemias (Dysproteinemias) Paraproteinemias are characterized by pronounced elevations of normal or abnormal immunoglobulins in the blood. 6.1. Polyclonal gammopathies Polyclonal gammopathies are broad based elevations in all immunoglobulin classes. They are idiopathic, associated with infectious of immunologic diseases, or a consequence of aging. There is a tendency for immunoglobulin levels to rise with age. Old animals and humans generally have higher immunoglobulin levels, especially IgG, than youngeranimals. Elevations in immunoglobulins with aging are often associated with an increasedincidence of autoantibodies and decreasing levels of normal cellular immunity. 6.2. Monoclonal gammopathies Monoclonal gammopathies are characterized by elevations in specific immunoglobulin classes, usually derived from a single clone of B-cells. The pathologic immunoglobulin isusually not directed at any identifiable antigen. In rare cases, however, the antibodyspecificity is identifiable (usually because of some pathologic effect of the monoclonalantibody). Monoclonal immunoglobulins are also called M-proteins. Monoclonal302 N.C. Pedersen / Veterinary Immunology and Immunopathology 69 (1999) 251-342gammopathies are either benign or malignant, with the latter being most common in the dog. 6.2.1. Monoclonal gammopathies associated with chronic infectious diseases The line between polyclonal and monoclonal gammopathies can be blurred in certain chronic infectious diseases. Fourteen dogs with chronic Ehrlichia canis infection were found to have gammopathy; serum protein electrophoresis demonstrated patterns ofdistinct narrow based monoclonal spikes, broad based monoclonal spikes, and monoclonal spikes superimposed on polyclonal spikes (Breitschwerdt et al., 1987). A monoclonal gammopathy causing hyperviscosity and acute blindness has also been seenin a dog with ehrlichiosis (Harrus et al., 1998). A German shepherd dog with ehrlichiosisand monoclonal gammopathy was treated with both antibiotics and plasmapheresis(Matus et al., 1987). A monoclonal gammopathy has also been observed in a dog withplasmacytic gasteroenteritis; the gammopathy resolved with dietary and immunosup-pressive treatment (Diehl et al., 1992). 6.2.2. Multiple myeloma A multiple myeloma is a malignancy derived from a single plasma cell that has been clonally expanded. Myelomas can produce no immunoglobulins or parts of immunoglo-bulins (MacEwen et al., 1984; Marks et al., 1995), whole immunoglobulins of any class(Couto et al., 1984; Finnie and Wilks, Kirschner 1988; Orr et al., 1981), orparts of immunoglobulins such as light or heavy chains (Hoenig, 1987). Myelomas occuralmost exclusively in aged animals. Myelomas in dogs are recognized more frequently inDoberman Pinschers (Hoenig, 1987) than other breeds. 6.2.3. of B-cell origin (usually CLL) secrete M-protein (Breuer et al., 1993). The most common M-protein associated with B-celllymphosarcomas is IgM, followed by IgG. IgA is usually not secreted by lymphoblastoidcell tumors. Features of lymphosarcomas that secrete M-proteins are similar to thosedescribed for multiple myelomas. 6.2.4. Disease associated with monoclonal gammopathies Clinical signs are referable to: 1. space occupying lesions, usually in flat bones such as skull, vertebrae, ribs, or pelvis, which cause pain, limping, diarrhea, neurological signs, etc. (Gibson et al., 1997;Maeda et al., 1993; Raskin and Krehbiel, 1988; Tuch and Tuch, 1992), or in softtissues such as liver, spleen, intestine and bone marrow (Kato et al., 1995; Petersonand Meininger, 1997); 2. hyperviscosity syndrome, usually associated with IgA or IgM myelomas (Center and Smith, 1982; Kirschner et al., 1988); 3. cryoglobulinemia (abnormal protein that precipitates when cooled); 4. paraneoplastic syndrome (Hendrix et al., 1998; Villiers and Dobson, 1998);N.C. Pedersen / Veterinary Immunology (1999) 251-342 3035. amyloidosis (Geisel Platz et al., 1997); or 6. immunosuppression (normal immunoglobulins are greatly depressed in animals with monoclonal gammopathies). Myelomas in dogs are equally distributed between the skeleton, usually flat bones, and soft tissue organs such as the intestinal tract, spleen, and other internal organs. Plasma cell leukemias are rare (Couto et al., 1984). Bone lesions are often lyric in nature and if they are in areas such as vertebral bodies, clinical signs such as paresis may result. Tumorinvolvement of internal organs is more likely to be associated with vague signs of diseaseand weight loss occurring over many weeks or months. Hyperviscosity syndrome is a specific complication of certain monoclonal gammo- pathies. IgM or IgA M-proteins, if present in high enough concentration, will greatlyincrease the viscosity of the serum. Hyperviscosity will lead, in turn, to an increased loadon the heart and hypertension, and vascular thrombosis due to blood sludging in smaller vessels. Animals with hyperviscosity syndrome commonly present with signs of heart failure, collapse, retinal hemorrhages, or acute neurologic signs. Some M-proteins, usually of the IgM class, behave as cryoglobulins and will precipitate in smaller blood vessels when the serum is cooled. Cryoglobulinemia isusually associated with gangrene of the extremities (ear tips, digits, eyelids, tip of tail,etc.). Exposure to cold weather may exacerbate or precipitate clinical signs. Pathogenic function of M-protein may be related to specific antibody binding to host antigen. Some M-proteins behave as cold agglutinins and animals will present with signs referable to hemolytic anemia and thrombosis. A human with a bizarre neurologic syndrome was found to have M-proteins specific for a nerve tissue antigen. A similarsituation may have occurred in a German shepherd dog with multiple myeloma andassociated polyneuropathy; the neuropathy disappeared when the dog was givenchemotherapy for the tumor and the gammopathy resolved (Villiers and Dobson, 1998). Amyloidosis is a common and sometimes fatal sequelae of idiopathic monoclonal gammopathies, or relationship ofamyloidosis and monoclonal gammopathies is not as obvious in animals, probably because animals have a much lower incidence of idiopathic monoclonal gammopathy than man and are therefore more apt to present with more common signs of the tumor. Immunosuppression (hypogammaglobulinemia) is frequently associated with mono- clonal gammopathies in People with gammopathies have abnormally low levelsof normal immunoglobulin and suffer from chronic skin, respiratory, and intestinal tractinfections. Immunosuppression, however, is not usually associated with monoclonalgammopathies of animals. Once again, this is probably due to the low incidence ofidiopathic monoclonal gammopathies in animals compared to man. 6.2.5. Diagnosis of gammopathies Total protein levels are usually elevated in animals with gammopathies, and this may be the first tip-off of the condition. Many conditions falsely raise the total protein levelsmeasured by refractometer, e.g. hyperbilirubinemia, hyperlipidemia, hyperfibrinogen-emia, hemolysis, and dehydration. The total protein and albumin levels measured on304 N.C. Pedersen / Veterinary Immunology and Immunopathology 69 (1999) 251-342automated chemistry panels is probably a better indication of globin increases (TP\u00ffalbumin\u0088globulin). Serum electrophoresis gives a relative measurement of the concentrations of major proteins in the serum. Monoclonal proteins may show up as specific M-protein spike inthe electrophoresis profile. Serum levels of IgG, can be measured by aradial-immunodiffusion assay. Polyclonal gammopathies will have elevations of all Igclasses, while monoclonal gammopathies will have an elevation of one Ig class and depressions of the others. Serum can also be tested for hyperviscosity. Serum is allowed to drip through a pipette tip or needle. The time required for a given volume of normal serum to pass through theneedle or pipette is compared with the time required for the abnormal serum. The test canalso be run by comparing the time an abnormal and normal drop of serum takes to rundown to the bottom of an inclined glass plate. Cryoglobulins are usually picked up by technicians doing the automated blood chemistries. The precipitate in the cooled serum will usually plug the tip of the sample aspirator. Serum can be cooled and centrifuged; a dense precipitate will sediment to the bottom of the tube. The precipitate will dissolve when warmed to 37 8C. A common test for monoclonal gammopathies in humans is the Bence-Jones protein test on urine. Bence-Jones protein is mainly light chains of immunoglobulin. Excess lightchain secretion into the urine can occur as a result of catabolism of large amounts M-protein or originate from myelomas that produce free light chains rather than intactimmunoglobulins. Urine is treated with NH 4SO4, and a precipitate indicates presence of Bence-Jones protein. Unfortunately, the Bence-Jones protein test is not very diagnostic in dogs, because very few myelomas in dogs produce free light chains. 6.2.6. Treatment of paraproteinemias The treatment of polyclonal gammopathies is never directed at the production of the immunoglobulin per se, but rather at the inciting cause. Multiple myelomas are treated with prednisolone and alkylating agents such as Alkeran (phenylalanine mustard). Prognosis is good for remission in dogs, but the long-term prognosis is poor due to relapse. Specific lymphoma chemotherapy protocols areused to treat monoclonal antibody producing pre-B-cell tumors. If hyperviscosity is a problem, then plasmapheresis or removal of plasma is indicated. The same treatment may be necessary to lower the levels of monoclonal cold agglutinins. 7. Immunodeficiency diseases7.1. Review of innate and adaptive immunity The following discussions are based on reviews of the immune system in dogs, humans and other species (Felsburg, 1994; Janeway and Travers, 1996). 7.1.1. Innate immunity Immunity is both innate and adaptive in nature. Innate immune mechanisms are non- specific, require no previous experience with the invading microbe, and are immediatelyN.C. Pedersen / Veterinary Immunology and Immunopathology 69 (1999) 251-342 305available. Innate immunity is effective against most microorganisms encountered daily in life and that cause perceptible disease only on occasion. In contrast, adaptive immunityoccurs only when microbes breach innate defenses; such microbes tend to be highlyantigen specific and require several days to reach maximum growth. Adaptive immuneresponses are characterized by the generation of antigen-specific cells (B- and T-lymphocytes) that specifically target the pathogen, as well as memory cells that allowrapid response to reinfection. Innate immunity appeared very early in evolution and is the sole defense mechanism in lower animals. Various components of the innate immune system served as 'evolutionaryscaffolds' for subsequent adaptive immune responses. This step-wise evolution isrecapitulated during an immune response; innate immunity slows down the infection, thusallowing time for adaptive immunity to take hold, and provides both the trigger and'scaffolding' on which adaptive immune reactions develop. Epithelial and mucosal barriers are the first lines of defense. The mucosa is thrown up into microvilli to increase surface area and to retain the mucus layer. Air, in the case of the respiratory tract, or digesta, in the case of the intestinal tract, move over this surface film. The mucous film contains phagocytes and a number of non-specific antimicrobialsubstances. The cornified layer of skin seals off and protects living cells underneath andacts as a sponge for normal flora and other non-specific protective substances. Non-specific antimicrobial substances include fatty acids (skin), (saliva, sweat,tears), pepsin (gut), hydrochloric acid (stomach), and antibacterial peptides such as thedefensins (intestine). Normal skin and mucosal flora also compete for nutrients andattachment to epithelium, and produces antimicrobial substances. The alternative pathway of complement activation is another arm of the innate immune response. C3 is constantly being converted (activated) to C3b at low levels. C3b isattracted to cell membranes, where it activates and combines with another serum proteincalled Bb, forming C3b/Bb complexes. Additional proteins called CR1, MCP and DAFare present on the surface of normal cells and act to inactivate C3b/Bb complex. C3b/Bbis a C3 convertase that leads to conversion of C3 to C3b. The surfaces of many microbeslack these enzymes, hence cell bound C3b/Bb is not inactivated. C3/Bb can act as anopsonin for phagocytes and as an activator of the complement cascade. The properdin system is another potent non-specific defense mechanism. Many microbes favor the binding of properdin (factor P). Factor P stabilizes the C3/Bbcomplex, thus preventing their dissociation and allowing the buildup of C3b andactivation of the classical complement pathway. Macrophages also play a key role in innate immunity and are the triggering cells for many adaptive immune responses. Macrophages mature continuously from circulatingmonocytes, which leave the circulation and migrate into tissues throughout the body.Macrophages possess a number of surface receptors for microbes, including mannose receptors, scavenger receptor, bacterial lipopolysaccharide binding receptor, and leukocyte integrin (CR3 or Mac-1). These receptors can bind with surface proteins ona wide range of microbial pathogens, thus triggering phagocytosis and IL-12. Cytokines are key substances in the development of adaptive immunity. They induce local inflammation and attract inflammatory cells into the area through increased306 N.C. Pedersen / Veterinary Immunology and Immunopathology 69 (1999) 251-342production of adhesion molecules on vascular These include neutrophils, eosinophils, lymphocytes and monocytes. Increased vascularpermeability also results, leading to an influx of fluids. Microphages, i.e., neutrophils, are abundant in bloodstream but are not normally found outside of blood vessels in normal circumstances. The innate immune response producesmany substances that are chemotactic for neutrophils. Bacterial cell wall components canbind directly to membrane receptors on neutrophils. Lipopolysaccharide binding protein in serum can bind bacterial LPS and the complex can be bound to neutrophils. Bacteria phagocytosed by neutrophils can be killed by toxic oxygen metabolites, proteases,phospolipases and defensins. Acute phase reactants also function in the innate immune system. Certain proteins are produced in response to the release of cytokines such as TNF- a, IL-1 and IL-6. C-reactive protein consists of five identical subunits, which binds to phosphoryl chloline in the cellwalls of bacteria and fungi. C-reactive protein binding to microbial cell wall inducesopsonization and activates the complement cascade. Mannose binding protein can also react with mannose residues on the surfaces of many microbes and induce phagocytosis and complement activation. Interferons are small proteins that are produced by virus infected cells. Interferons are produced by many types of virus infected cells and act on distant cells to render themresistant to viral replication. Interferons aandbare induced during the innate phase of immunity, while interferon gappears only during the adaptive stage of the immune response. Interferons also activate natural killer (NK) cells and upregulate MHC class Ireceptor expression. The latter activity protects normal cells from non-specific destruction by NK cells. Natural killer cells are a population of T-lymphocytes that lack CD8 and CD4 surface markers. NK cells evolved much earlier in phylogeny than T- and B-cells responsible foradaptive immunity. NK cells become potent killers when they receive specific activationsignals. NK cell activity is enhanced 100 \u0002by interferon a,band IL-12. Therefore, invasion of host cells by most microbial pathogens will activate NK cells. Activated NK cells can bind to infected cells by several mechanisms. Infected cells elaborate increased levels of sulfated proteoglycans on their surfaces. NK cells have receptors that will bind to this substance, and NK cell binding leads to the elaboration of cytotoxins that act at very short range. The activation of NK cells to killer cells isinhibited, however, if the NK cell identifies self-MHC-I proteins; hence the importanceconstant MHC-I upregulation in normal cells. Virus infected cells will elaborate fewerMHC-1 receptors, either by viral interference with protein synthesis or virus blocking ofMHC-1 export to the cell surface. Such cells are resistant to interferon aandbinduced MHC-1 upregulation. Host cells that do not display MHC-I will then be killed byactivated NK cells. There is also evidence that virus infected cell may introduce new peptides into the MHC receptors, thus preventing normal self-recognition by NK cells. T-cells bearing the ganddcell surface proteins are found specifically in epithelial surfaces (skin and mucosa). They do not recirculate and their surface receptors arehomogeneous in any one epithelium. Because of the homogeneity of their receptors, it isthought that g:dT-cells do not recognize specific microbes, but rather respond to non- specific changes induced in a particular epithelium as a result of some insult (usuallyN.C. Pedersen / Veterinary Immunology and Immunopathology 69 (1999) 251-342 307microbial). g:dT-cells can recognize epithelial cells that have been affected by stress or heat shock proteins, as well as cells that have aberrant expression of self-recognition (i.e.,MHC) markers. Intra-epithelial g:dT-cells possess killer activity following receptor binding to other cells. Innate immunity also involves a certain subpopulation of B-cells. The production of specific antibodies by conventional B-cells is important in adaptive immunity. There is,however, a separate lineage of B-cells (i.e., CD5 \u0087) that are more limited in their V gene diversity, that are self-renewing without previous exposure to antigen and T-cell independent, and that predominate in certain areas of the body such as the peritonealcavity. They do not undergo immunoglobulin class switching and their predominantimmunoglobulin production is IgM. CD5 \u0087B-cells do not exhibit immunologic memory, and antibody production peaks by 48 h, which is much faster than regular B-cellsundergoing an adaptive immune response. CD5 \u0087B-cells make antibodies mainly to polysaccharide antigens present on many bacterial cell walls. It is thought that CD5 \u0087B- cells are evolutionary precursors of conventional B-cells, just as g:dT-cells may be precursors of a:bT-cells. The 'natural' antibodies produced by CD5 \u0087B-cells probably play an important role in natural defenses against bacterial infection, especially within theperitoneal cavity. 7.1.2. Adaptive immunity T-cells bearing the a:bsurface markers are central to adaptive immunity, and were preceded in evolution by g:dT-cells. The first step in adaptive immunity is antigen recognition and T-cell activation. T-cell activation occurs when antigen (free or cell-associated) is encountered in draining lymphoid organs. Antigen in the form of particulate substances or whole microbes is taken up by macrophages and antigen presenting cells. These cells present the specific antigenic signal on their surfaceseither in context of MHC-I (cell-associated microbes) or MHC-II (ingested particulateantigen). Activation of the innate immune system leads to monokine release and increased trafficking of CD4 \u0087T lymphocytes through the involved lymphoid organs. This increased trafficking of naive CD4 \u0087T-cells increases the likelihood that a cell bearing the appropriate receptor will be brought into contact with its corresponding antigen. T-cell differentiation is central to the direction of the adaptive immune response. When naive CD4\u0087T-cells contact their specific antigen, a process of differentiation is triggered. This differentiation can follow two general paths: (1) the cell can become aninflammatory (effector) T-cells, i.e., T-helper 1 cells or Th1-cells, or (2) a helper T-cells, i.e., T-helper two cells or Th2-cells. The course that most cells take during animmune response depends on the cytokine milieu generated during the innate phase ofimmunity. Generally speaking, Th1-cells generate cell-mediated immunity, while Th2-cells induce antibody production. CD8 \u0087T-cells are activated in the same manner and are destined to become specific cell killers (i.e., cytotoxic T-cells). T-effector cells are fully activated by 4-5 days into an infection. They are guided to the specific site of infection by upregulated surface markers (integrins) on their surfaces andcorresponding upregulated receptors (cell adhesion molecules, selectins) on the surfacesof endothelial cells in the target area. Inflammatory T-cells activate macrophages at the308 N.C. Pedersen / Veterinary Immunology and Immunopathology 69 (1999) 251-342site of infection, which greatly enhances their ability to kill intracellular microbes. CD8 \u0087 cytotoxic cells act in a manner similar to NK cells in the killing of infected cells. Activated T-effector cells attach to infected target cells through the double key mechanism of (1) identifying the specific antigen arrayed within the MHC and (2)recognizing self-markers also in the MHC (see discussion in section on Innate Immunity).When the proper recognition signals are received, the T-effector cells will elaboratecytotoxins that will kill the abnormal cell. Naive B-cells possessing the appropriate surface receptor cannot be activated until they contact an armed T-helper cell that is specific for one of the peptides derived from thatantigen. Specifically stimulated B-cells undergo rapid clonal expansion and differentia-tion, going from mature resting B-cells, to plasmablasts, and finally to plasma cells.Initial antibody production is usually of the IgM type and occurs by lymphoblasts in theT-cell areas of the lymphoid organs. Plasmablasts migrate to bone marrow and medullarycords where they become sessile plasma cells. Plasma cells are highly efficient atantibody production, undergo class switching (IgM to IgG to IgA), and can sustain low level antibody production from prolonged periods of time. IgM is a pentameric form of IgG and was the first immunoglobulin class to evolve (in lower fish). Because ontogeny recapitulates phylogeny, IgM is also the first antibodysystem to develop in a fetus and is the first class of antibody to appear during theevolution of an individual immune response. For instance, new born puppies can produceIgM upon antigenic stimuli late in gestation and at birth, while IgG and IgA responsestake several weeks longer to manifest (2-4 weeks of age). If an older puppy is infectedwith a microbe, the first antibodies that appear are of the IgM class, followed later by IgG and IgA. IgM is the most primitive and important immunoglobulin class. IgM antibodies are strong complement binders, strongly lyric, and circulate both in the plasma and aresecreted unto mucous membranes. Therefore, IgM shares many of the functions foundcollectively in other Ig subclasses. IgG makes up most of the circulating antibodies.Unlike IgM, it can gain access to the interstitial fluids. It is the predominant antibodymade in lymph nodes and spleen and has major importance against systemic microbialinfections. IgA is a dimer and evolved after IgM and IgG. It is produced in greatest amounts in diffuse lymphoid aggregates and is the principal secretory antibody. The IgA system has very little immunological memory and depends on continuous antigenicexposure for maintenance. IgA is important for control of local infections of mucousmembranes. IgE is a monomer and is the most recently evolved Ig. Like IgA, IgE issecreted mainly by plasma cells present in diffuse lymphoid aggregates underlying skinand mucous membranes. IgE is non-complement binding and is intimately associatedwith circulating basophils and tissue mast cells. IgE binds with great avidity to cellmembrane receptors present on these cells. IgE and its associated mast-cell responses are intimately associated with parasite immunity. Although antibody binding provides specificity, the ultimate effect of that binding is usually determined by complement. The complement system is comprised of largenumber of distinct plasma proteins. When the initial complement components areappropriately triggered on the surface of the pathogen, either by antibody-, lectin/mannose-, or alternative-pathways, a cascade of reactions occurs with preceding proteinsN.C. Pedersen / Veterinary Immunology and Immunopathology 69 (1999) 251-342 309acting as enzyme activators for subsequent proteins. Earlier components of the cascade (C3a, C4a, C5a), act to recruit phagocytes to the site or to enhance opsonization (C3b),while terminal pathway, C1q molecule binds to antibody molecule to trigger buildup of C3convertase on pathogen surface through activation of C1, C4, and C2. The complementcascade can also be activated the lectin pathway, where mannose-binding proteinbinds mannan on pathogen surface through MBP : MASP, C4 and C2. A third, or alternative, pathway of complement activation involves the buildup of C3, proteins B and D on the pathogen's surface and leading to C3convertase. One outcome of adaptive immunity is the establishment of immunologic memory. Memory is the ability of the immune response to respond more rapidly and efficiently topathogens that have been encountered previously. Immunologic memory relies on boththe clonal expansion and clonal differentiation of specific memory lymphocytes duringthe primary immune response. Memory T-cells are long-lived. Retained antigens, either particulate or organismal, may be important in maintenance of memory. 7.2. Immunodeficiency states The characteristic features of immunodeficiency: 1. infections caused by microbes that are normally not pathogenic; 2. unusually severe or persistent infections that are normally mild and self-limiting; 3. an inordinate number of different infections in the same individual; 4. recurrence of infections that occurred in a subclinical form earlier in life, and5. infections that are unexplainably difficult to treat. Immunodeficiency states involve either innate or adaptive immune responses and are of congenital or acquired origin. 7.2.1. Congenital immunodeficiency 7.2.1.1. Congenital innate immunity . Congenital causes of innate immunodeficiency are varied and common in humans and are being increasinglyrecognized in dogs. Although very little clinical research has been on dogs in regards to deficiencies in more classical aspects of innate immunity, there are several areas where such defects are obvious. Normal anatomy is essential for the integrity of the individual, but few people think of immunity when they study anatomy. However, anatomic defects are probably the mostcommon cause of innate immunodeficiency related illnesses in dogs. Tissues that coverboth external and internal body surfaces are the most important component of innateimmunity. Skin has an outer cornified layer that resists microbial growth and invasion.Glandular secretions onto the skin and mucous membranes also contain non-specific antimicrobial substances. Some Sharpei dogs have abnormal skin and are predisposed to constant skin infections. The cilia of the mucous membranes, especially those of the310 N.C. Pedersen / Veterinary Immunology and Immunopathology 69 (1999) 251-342respiratory and genitourinary tracts, act as brooms to trap and sweep out foreign material. The ciliary layer also acts as a substrate to trap and hold mucus secretions. Congenitaldefects of cilia, which render them immobile, occur in humans and animals. Dogs withimmobile cilia syndrome (primary ciliary dyskinesia) suffer greatly from recurrent anddifficult to treat infections of the upper and lower airways (Edwards et al., 1992). Small brachycephalic breeds of dogs suffer much more from periodontal disease than larger sporting breeds. These small breeds often have malpositioned jaws and teeth, which alters the pressure that is normally placed on the periodontial ligaments. Many small breeds will not chew on hard objects, which further decreases the exercise of theperiodontial tissues and prevents tarter removal. The net effect of these abnormal forces isa gradual weakening of the periodontial ligaments, tooth mobility, periodontial pocketformation, bacterial over colonization, periodontitis, resultant local bone resorption, andmore tooth instability. A wide range of anatomic anomalies of tissues other than those of skin and mucous membranes have been associated with immunodeficiency. For instance, the sphincters of the urogenital, gastrointestinal and respiratory tracts act as doors to prevent the influx of microbes. Animals with congenital anomalies of the urethral sphincter or ectopic ureterwill leak urine continuously to the outside. Bacteria then grow up the urine stream andinfect the bladder. Animals with abnormal ureters that obstruct normal urine flow fromthe kidney often develop hydroureter and hydronephrosis; such animals are very prone tosevere and recurrent bacterial pyelonephritis. Animals with congenital anomalies of thelarynx may aspirate food into their lungs and develop pneumonia. Individuals with clefthard or soft palates will frequently develop chronic nasal infections due to foreign material being drawn into the nasal cavity. Certain breeds of dogs flattened faces and protruding eyes may have problems with tear drainage, causing excessive wetness aroundthe eyes and bacterial overgrowth. A similar situation occurs in animals with congenitalblockage of the lacrimal ducts. Dogs are much more prone to external ear infections thanother species because of the length and angulation of their external ear canals. Dogs thathave hair growing down their ear canals are even more prone to infection than dogs thatdo not. Substances secreted onto the skin and mucous membranes by the various glandshave an important non-specific microbial function. Dogs that secrete too little substances onto the skin are much more prone to chronic and recurrent skin infections. Paradoxically, too much secretion can have the same effect. Therefore, animals withboth seborrhea sicca and seborrhea oleosa suffer from chronic 7.2.1.2. Congenital defects in adaptive immunity . Congenital anomalies of virtually all aspects of adaptive immunity have occurred in people and animals. Most of the literature on these anomalies has been generated from naturally occurring disease in humans orinbred strains of laboratory mice. Congenital defects in phagocytosis range from mild to highly lethal, depending on their nature and severity. Because severe defects usually lead to early death, it is the less severephagocytic defects that are often seen clinically. A defect in leukocyte adhesionmolecules CD11b and CD18 on recessive trait in IrishSetters (Trowald-Wigh et al., 1992). Affected animals suffer from recurrent fevers, polyarthritis, skin lesions, and stunted growth almost from birth and seldom live past oneN.C. Pedersen / Veterinary Immunology and Immunopathology 69 (1999) 251-342 311year of age. They have extremely high levels of mature hypersegmented neutrophils in their blood. Neutrophils are being summoned in large numbers from the bone marrow, butfew of them find their way into sites of inflammation. Poorly characterized neutrophilphagocyte abnormalities have been reported in Weimeraners and associated withrecurrent infections (Hansen et al., 1995). Cyclic neutropenia in grey Collies \u2014Some grey Collie dogs, and rare mongrels with similar coat color, have profound cyclical fluctuations, usually over a 12-14 day period, in the numbers of neutrophils (Yang, 1987). The disorder is due to an autosomally recessive gene and is identical to human cyclic neutropenia (Yang, 1987). Periods of bonemarrow inactivity and neutropenia are followed by a period of flamboyant bone marrowactivity characterized by monocytosis, thrombocytosis, reticulocytosis and neutrophilia(Pratt et al., 1990). Affected dogs are very prone to local and systemic bacterialinfections, often of a cyclic nature; the pathological effects are cumulative and affectedpuppies rarely survive to six months of age (Yang, 1987). The disorder is due to a heritable recessive regulatory defect of hematopoietic stem cells (Dale et al., 1995). An abnormal response to granulocyte colony stimulating factor (G-CSF) has been implicated in the pathophysiology of the syndrome, in particular adefect in the G-CSF signal transduction pathway distal to G-CSF receptor expression orbinding (Avalos et al., 1994). The neutropenia has greatly improved with G-CSFtreatment, although cycling was still observed (Lothrop et al., 1988; Mishu et al., 1992).Better results may have been obtained when G-CSF was given in combination with stemcell factor (Dale et al., 1995). Complement deficiencies involving a number of the individual components of the classical and alternative complement proteins have been described in man and various animal species. These abnormalities involve either the total absence of a complementfactor or the production of a factor that is structurally and functionally abnormal. Dogswith complement deficiencies often live into adulthood and beyond, but tend to sufferfrom atypical, recurrent, or persistent infections of the skin and respiratory tract(Ameratunga et al., 1998; Blum et al., 1985). Humans with complement deficiencies alsohave a higher incidence of some immunologic diseases such as SLE and rheumatoid-likearthritis (Sleasman, 1996). Heritable deficiencies of humoral immunity are surprisingly common. They usually involve deficiencies of specific immunoglobulin classes. The most common heritabledeficiency of this type in man and animals involves IgA. About 1 : 500 people lack IgA.Absolute deficiencies of IgA are common in Chinese Shar peis, while partial deficienciesare common in German shepherd dogs (Day and Penhale, 1988a). The disorder has alsobeen observed in other breeds, such as the Beagle. IgA deficiencies are manifested byincreased incidence of skin and respiratory infections (Felsburg et al., 1985). Individualswith IgA deficiencies often have more problems with allergies, probably because the IgE system is called upon to compensate for the lack of IgA-mediated immunity. Several bloodlines in a colony of English cocker spaniels were reported to have relative IgAdeficiency, a high incidence of ANA, Coomb's antibodies, SLE, hypothyroidism andidiopathic cardiomyopathy (Day, 1996a, b, c). Attempts to link aspergillosis in Germanshepherd dogs to their variable IgA deficiency have been negative (Day and Penhale,1988a).312 N.C. Pedersen / Veterinary Immunology and Immunopathology 69 (1999) 251-342Some German shepherd dogs appear to have a selective inability to mount normal humoral immune responses. The majority of dogs with systemic aspergillosis, caused byA. terreus , do not develop demonstrable antibody responses to the organism by agar gel diffusion, counter immunoelectrophoresis, ELISA and indirect immunofluorescence (Dayand Penhale, 1988b). However, these same animals have significantly increasedpolyclonal IgG production. Severe combined immunodeficiencies , commonly known as SCIDs, occur in both man and animals and is usually associated with heritable defects in metabolic pathways critical for T- cell development. The classical form of this SCIDs is the 'boy in the glass bubble', associatedwith adenine deaminase deficiency. A similar disease, but with different genetic basis,occurs in Basset hounds. Affected Bassett hounds often develop canine distemper at 10-16weeks of age, when their maternal immunity wane. The source of the distemper virus is fromtheir live virus vaccines. Animals that do not develop distemper, will usually fail to thrive anddie by 5-6 months of age. SCID, associated with a X-linked defect in interleukin-2 (IL-2)receptor function, was described in a family of Cardigan Welsch corgis (Deschenes et al., 1994; Jezyk et al., 1989; Pullen et al., 1997). The defect is caused by a single nucleotide insertion in the gchain of the canine IL-2 receptor (Somberg et al., 1995). The same defect has been observed in a subset of people with SCIDS (Henthorn et al., 1994). Clinical featuresinclude failure to T-cell mitogen 1993; Somberg et al., 1996). Dogsraised in conventional environments usually die of environmental or vaccine-virus associatedinfections by five months of age. Dogs with the defect can be maintained indefinitely ingnotobiotic environments, although the incidence of leukemias may be increased (Felsburg et al., 1994). Selective immunodeficiencies of unknown type have been well described in dogs, virtually always in purebreds. German shepherd dogs are known to be much moresusceptible to Ehrlichia canis infection than mongrels and et al., 1985, 1986; Kabay et al., 1985;Mortellaro et al., 1989), and to generalized pyodermas (Rosser, 1997). Rottweilers areparticularly susceptible to parvovirus infection, systemic fungal infections, and oral papillomavirus infection (Bredal et al., 1996). Certain Dachshunds have developed severe Pneumocystis carinii infections of the lungs (Lobetti et al., 1996), a disorder only described in human AIDS patients. A certain subset of young (Medleau and Willemse,1995), and occasionally aged (Duclos et al., 1994), dogs appear to be more susceptible tosystemic demodectic mange. Great Danes and cryptococcal infections than other breeds (Malik et al., 1995). Labrador and Goldenretrievers are 5-6 times more susceptible to a type of glomerulonephritis that has beenputatively associated with Borrelia burgdorferi infection (Dambach et al., 1997). Neospora caninum infection, in both neonatal and adult forms, is almost always observed in purebred dogs (Barber and Trees, 1996; Cuddon et Poli 1998; Pumarola et al., 1996). Dogs with selectiveimmunodeficiencies have normal immune responses to other infectious agents, normalcomplement and Ig levels, and will even respond favorably if treated properly for theproblem infection (Day et al., 1985).N.C. Pedersen / Veterinary Immunology and Immunopathology 69 (1999) 251-342 313Uncharacterized immunodeficiencies have been reported in several breeds. An immunodeficiency syndrome has been described in Irish Setters (Cauvin and Connolly,1997). An intriguing syndrome manifested by acute fever, gastrointestinal signs, and malaise has been observed in Weimeraner puppies (Couto et al., 1989). These initial signs, whichvary in severity, are often followed by mild to severe hypertrophic osteodystrophy (HOD)(Woodard, 1982). In some animals, recurrent disease signs involving the alimentary tract, joints, skin, peripheral lymph nodes, central nervous system and conjunctiva persist through adolescence (Day et al., 1997). The condition has been reportedly associated withvariable decreases in one or more immunoglobulin isotopes (Couto et al., 1989; Dayet al., 1997) neutrophil functional abnormalities (Couto et al., 1989; Hansenet al., 1995). Although most breeders feel that the condition is triggered by vaccination(Dodds, 1999), some puppies have developed the condition even when not vaccinated.The condition appears to fall in the category of common variable immunodeficiency(CVID) of humans. CVID is a heterogenous syndrome (Spickett et al., 1997), characterized by humoral immunodeficiency involving one or more immunoglobulin isotypes, recurrent bacterial infections and a variety of other immunologic abnormalities(Eibl and Wolf, 1995; Eisenstein and Sneller, 1994). Affected humans show variousdefects in T-cell regulation of B-cells, B-cell activation, or of cytokine responses.However, there are notable differences in the Weimaraner syndrome from CVID inpeople: 1. The disease occurs solely in puppies, whereas CVID can be seen in infants, children and adults; 2. CVID is rarely self-limiting, whereas many affected dogs appear to outgrow the condition; and 3. affected dogs respond dramatically to steroid therapy, while humans are treated with g globulin to compensate for the antibody deficiencies. If inappropriately treated, many affected Weimaraner puppies will die or be euthanitized. Glucocorticoid treatment is highly effective in breaking the febrile response, resolving systemic signs, and hastening the resolution of the HOD. Unfortunately, many veterinarians will not use this treatment, because they mistakenly view the conditionpurely as an immunodeficiency. A suspected primary immunodeficiency syndrome has been seen in three related Irish wolfhounds (Leisewitz et al., 1997). The dogs presented at less than one year of age witha history of chronic nasal discharge and persistent lower respiratory tract disease. Thesigns improved on antibiotic treatment, but recurred when treatment was stopped. A cell-mediated immunodeficiency was suspected based on cursory testing, but this diagnosis is not compatible with this type of clinical signs. IgA or complement deficiencies, and cilliary dyskinesis, would be more likely causes. A primary immunodeficiency syndrome may also occur in Chinese Shar-pei dogs (Rivas et al., 1995). The presenting signs were recurrent infections and malignancies.Abnormally low levels of serum IgM and IgA were present in most affected dogs, and lowIgG in a lesser proportion.314 N.C. Pedersen / Veterinary Immunology and Immunopathology 69 (1999) 251-3427.2.2. Acquired immunodeficiency 7.2.2.1. Innate immunity . Diseases that compromise the integrity of the epidermis and overlying cornified layer can be complicated by secondary infections with resident bacteria, especially S.aureus . Burns, atopic dermatitis, flea bite dermatitis, and bullous diseases are just a few examples of primary skin diseases that are often complicated bysecondary infections. Normal flora in the skin, oropharynx, and lower GI tract prevent theestablishment of abnormal flora. If the normal flora is compromised, pathological floracan take selective advantage of the situation. This problem is particularly serious withantibiotics are used in the presence of antibiotic resistant microorganisms. Many surgical procedures require the use of endotracheal tubes, forced respiration, and inhalant anesthetic gases. Endotracheal tubes will effectively bypass the innate immunity provided by the upper airways and carry oral bacteria down to the mainstem bronchi. Forced respiration during anesthesia can drive secretions from the upper air passages tothe lower airways. This is a serious problem when there is already preexisting lungdisease. Indwelling urinary catheters are a major source of infection for the urinary tract, and IV catheters a major source of infection for the blood. Urethrostomies frequently lead tocystitis, tracheostomies to tracheobronchitis, and oronasal fistulas to rhinitis. Acquired anomalies of phagocytosis are usually due to conditions that markedly decrease the number of available phagocytes. In contract, congenital phagocyte anomalies are usually associated with a decrease in the function of the phagocytes. Ineither case, the net effect is a diminished phagocytic capacity. This is usually manifestedby an increased incidence of infections caused by bacteria. Anticancer drug therapy oftenleads to profound cytopenias during the induction stages of treatment, putting them atgrave risk for infection. Autoimmune and drug induced neutropenias of immune originare often manifested by fevers and sepsis. Ninety percent of dogs necropsied for acuteparvovirus infection had recoverable E. coli in their lungs and liver (Turk et al., 1990); secondary infections with Candida albicans (Rodraiguez et al., 1998), perfringens (Turk et al., 1992), Edwardsiella tarda (Van Assche, 1991) have also been described. These secondary infections occur because of both profound neutropenia andthe effacement of the intestinal barrier. Anti-neoplastic drug therapy, aplastic anemias,and myeloid tumors may all be associated with severe neutropenias and secondaryinfections in dogs. Diabetes mellitus in humans and dogs is associated with defects inneutrophil function, and diabetic dogs have a greatly increased incidence of bacterialcystitis (Kirsch, 1998). Hepatic abscesses have also been described in two dogs with diabetes mellitus (Grooters et al., 1994). Selective suppression of cellular immunity by acquired diseases is very uncommon, because both cellular and humoral immunity are usually effected together. Drugslike Cyclosporine A have much more affect on cellular immunity than on humoralimmunity. Corticosteroids can inactivate infections that are kept contained mainly bycellular immunity, e.g. latent ringworm and demodectic mange infections. Splenectomyin dogs can lead to the reactivation of latent Haemobartonella canis infection. Chronic corticosteroid treatment frequently leads to bacterial cystitis, especially in female dogs.N.C. Pedersen / Veterinary Immunology and Immunopathology 69 (1999) 251-342 315Canine Distemper Virus infection can induce a severe combined T- and B-cells immunodeficiency. Dogs with distemper often have intractable secondary bacterialinfections of the lungs and intestinal tract and other unusual types of infection such asneosporosis. Indeed, chronic distemper in older dogs in shelters and kennels maymanifest as an immunodeficiency rather than a neurologic problem. Acquired deficiencies in humoral immunity are uncommon. Immunoglobulin secreting myelomas or lymphosarcomas are frequently associated with profound depressions of other immunoglobulin classes. Acquired hypogammaglobulinemia has been described occasionally in dogs, but is relatively common in humans. Affected individuals have adelay in their production of immunoglobulins. They are usually normal until maternalimmunity declines, and then suffer from systemic bacterial infections. The defect usuallycorrects itself with time. Failure of passive systemic immunity is a serious problem in foals and calves, but less common in puppies. Nevertheless, puppies that fail to nurse and are reared on milkreplacements lack passive systemic and local immunity. Such puppies are very susceptible to overwhelming intestinal or blood infection of bacterial origin. 8. Graft immunity Tissue and organ transplantation is now routine in human medicine and is being applied on a limited basis in veterinary medicine. The greatest hurdle preventing thewidespread use of organ transplantation in man and animals is the problem of tissueincompatibility and graft immunity. The body has complex immune mechanisms that recognize and destroy tissue that is foreign to itself. Animals have developed mechanisms for identifying and destroyingliving tissue from other species (xenogeneic tissue) for understandable reasons. Complexmicroorganisms such as parasites, bacteria, fungi, protozoa, and viruses are essentiallyxenografts trying to establish themselves in the body. Failing to recognize theirforeignness could cause death of the animal. When xenogeneic tissue, such as grafts ofmouse or cat tissue, are implanted in a dog, they are treated as if they were invadingmicroorganisms. Why the body has developed mechanisms to recognize and destroy tissue from members of its own species (allogeneic tissue) is not as easy to understand. Individuals of one species donot normally invade the bodies of other members of the same species, so alloimmunity seemsunnecessary. It has been theorized that self-recognition is important for preventingautoimmunity and the emergence of mutant cells that could harm the body (e.g., cancers).Graft rejection may also be a necessary side effect of MHC diversity. Diversity in the MHCs isessential for the survival of species when exposed to new infections. With the exception of pregnancy, where allogeneic tissue is not attacked by the host, allogeneic immunity is in continuous operation and complicates the whole approach to medicine. If it were not for allogeneic immunity, organs could be freely and easilyexchanged from one individual to another. Because of allogeneic immunity, surgeonsmust spend much of their time patching up old parts, bypassing defective parts wheneverpossible, or replacing faulty parts with new ones made of plastic, metal, or othersubstances that will not evoke a host response.316 N.C. Pedersen / Veterinary Immunology and Immunopathology 69 (1999) 251-342The trigger of tissue incompatibility rests in the structure of proteins found on the surfaces of cells. These proteins allow the immune system to discern whether the tissue isits own (autologous or syngeneic), of the same species but from a different individual(homologous or allogeneic), or from organisms of a different species altogether(heterologous or xenogeneic). The greater the difference between the antigens of thetissue and those of the host, the more immunogenic the tissue will be, and the morerapidly it will be recognized and destroyed. Although living xenografts are rarely given, xenogeneic tissues such as pericardium or catgut are widely used in surgery. Such grafts, however, serve only as scaffolds that will be repopulated by host tissue. Theirimmunogenicity is greatly diminished by chemical treatment. The allograft reaction is much stronger in the dog than in virtually any other species, including humans. This does not appear to be due to a greater degree of genetic diversityamong dogs, because genetic diversity within and between breeds is surprisingly small.Rather, the violence of allograft rejection in dogs seems to be some intrinsic property ofallograft immunity in the species. A great deal is known about the major histocompatibility antigens of dogs, because of the use of dogs in human transplantation research. The antigens on dog cells that defineallogeneic differences are found on many cell types. In grafts, alloantigens are rich inpassenger host lymphocytes Leukocytes, being particularlyrich in histocompatibility antigens and easy to collect from the blood, were the tissue ofchoice for early researchers. These early researchers used alloantibodies and mixed-lymphocyte reactions to define histocompatibility differences between individuals.Antigens that define histocompatibility differences are coded for by genes within the major histocompatibility complex (MHC) and are called dog leukocyte (DL) antigens. The genes of the MHC are found on a single chromosome. The first group of DL antigensthat have been defined are called A, hence the term DLA antigens. Current designationsof genes and alleles of the MHC in the dog are increasingly derived from actual DNAsequence. The DLA genes belong to either MHC class I or MHC class II. Class I genes were initially defined by serology, while class II genes were based on mixed lymphocytereactivity (Bull et al., 1987; Vriesendorp et al., 1971, 1973; Vriesendorp, 1979). Several sequence-based studies of canine MHC type I genes have been reported (Burnett et al., 1997; Graumann et al., 1998; Wagner et al., 1999). There are at least four MHC class I genes: DLA-88, DLA-12, DLA-64, and DLA-79 al., 1999). DLA-88 has at least 40 alleles, while the other class I loci have fewerthan 12 alleles. Within the dog MHC class II, region, clear homologues have been identifiedfor human DRA, DRB, DQA, and et al., 1998a, b; Polvi et al., 1997;Sarmiento et al., 1990, 1992, 1993; Wagner et al., 1996a, b, 1998). There are two genesin the DQ region, DQA1 and DQB1, and one gene in the DR region, DRB1. Using DNA sequence data, over 40 different alleles have been identified in the DLA-DRB1 gene, 18 alleles at the DLA-DQA1 loci, and over 20 alleles in the DLA-DQB1 gene (Kennedyet al., 1998a, b). In addition to the regions making up the MHC class I and II genes, adjacent regions contain genes that code for proteins which regulate the immune response. These immuneresponse (Ir) genes have been called IrGA, IrGL, and IrGT.N.C. / Veterinary Immunology and Immunopathology 69 (1999) 251-342 317As in humans, the histocompatibility complex in dogs is inherited as blocks; one block (haplotype) from the sire and one from the dam. If two siblings possess the sameserologically or DNA sequence defined DLA antigens at one loci, they will also possessthe identical haplotype. The greatest similarity between donor and recipient tissues willtherefore occur in DLA-identical siblings and the least identify will occur in DLA-different unrelated dogs. First-set rejection is the immune response that is directed against a graft in a previously unsensitized individual. It usually occurs over a period of 7-14 days when histocompatibility differences are great, or it can take several weeks when histocompat-ibility differences are weak. It begins as soon as the graft is vascularized in the donor.Donor lymphocytes (present in the graft at time of donation) and the graft endotheliumexpress significant surface concentrations of histocompatibility antigens. Donor orpassenger lymphocytes contain the highest level of alloantigens on their surfaces, whilenormal resting donor endothelium has a much lower amount. Recipient T-lymphocytessurveying the tissues rapidly detect these differences and bind to the surfaces of these cell types. What follows is essentially a delayed type hypersensitivity reaction targeted against donor lymphocytes (passenger lymphocytes) and the graft endothelium. The lattertissue is the essential target of the response, although passenger lymphocytes may play animportant primary sensitizing role. Activated lymphocytes specific for the alloantigens ofthe graft began to bind in low numbers to the graft endothelium and release theircytokines. One effect of the cytokines is to cause the graft endothelium to becomeactivated, which upregulates the surface expression of the alloantigens. This increase insurface alloantigen expression makes the graft endothelium much more vulnerable to attack by immune lymphocytes. As more and more activated T-cells bind to the endothelium, the mass of cytokine release causes eventual death of the endothelium. Withthe death of the endothelium, thrombosis occurs and the graft dies. RBC antigens may also be present on graft endothelium and act as targets for rejection. Therefore, donors and recipients are always matched for RBC types prior to grafting.Because there are far fewer RBC antigens than leukocyte antigens, this is not as big aproblem as leukocyte matching. Towards the end of first-set rejection, antibodies against the alloantigens are also produced. These antibodies bind to the endothelium and fix complement and have a destructive effect on the graft endothelium. Allografts placed into individuals that have been pre-sensitized to leukocyte alloantigens on the graft will be rejected within 24-72 h by largely antibody-mediateddestruction of the endothelium, a process known as second set or acute rejection. This isbecause the blood of the recipient contains high levels of cytotoxic alloantibodies inaddition to fromprevious grafting, previous blood transfusions, or through pregnancy. Second-set rejection can also occur when grafting against the RBC types, especially if the recipient has natural cytotoxic antibodies to the RBC type of the donor. Whole organ allografting is very uncommon in client owned dogs as a routine procedure, but is increasingly being done on an experimental and individual basis.Siblings with the same DLA type (as determined serologically or by DNA sequencing)can be successfully engrafted with a minimum of anti-rejection treatment. However,318 N.C. Pedersen / Veterinary Immunology and Immunopathology 69 (1999) 251-342mismatched transplants are vigorously rejected, unless intensely treated with certain drugs. The most significant breakthrough in transplantation in dogs may have come withthe discovery of leflunomide. Leflunomide, when used in combination with prednisoneand cyclosporine A, has allowed long-term maintenance of grafts between unrelated dogsfor the first time (Lirtzman et al., 1996). Pancreatic b-cell transplants have been successfully done in dogs by placing the purified b-cells in small semi-permeable chambers in the abdomen. These chambers allow the entrance and exit of soluble nutrients and hormones, but not of immune cells. 9. Therapy of immune-mediated diseases Several reviews on the application of 'immunosuppressive therapy' in dogs have been published (Miller, 1997a, b) but are no longer up to date with newer treatment strategies.A simple review of current immunosuppressive therapies is provided by Janeway and Travers (1996). Treatment of immunologic disorders is directed at two basic areas: (1) the cause of the abnormal immune reaction; or the (2) effect of the abnormal immune reaction. Forinstance, in the treatment of a food allergy, a hypoallergenic diet would be directed at thecause, while steroid therapy without a change in diet would be directed at the effect (thetype I mediated inflammation). Whenever possible, treatment should be directed at thecause of the abnormal immune reaction and not the end result. Drugs used to treat immunologic diseases are often called 'immunosuppressive'. However, it is not technically correct to say that all such drugs work through suppressing the immune response. In many cases, the ultimate mode of activity is one ofimmunomodulation or immunoregulation, where perturbed immune responses aremodulated back into normal balance. Most of the immunosuppressive drugs that areused were not developed with this activity in mind, e.g., glucocorticoids, cytotoxicagents. gold salts. Rather, they were initially used decades ago for their anti-inflammatory(steroids, gold salts), anti-tumor cell (cyclophosphamide, chlorambucil, azathioprine,vincristine,), or hormonal (danazol, megesterol acetate) activities. However, with the recent explosion of knowledge on the inter-workings of the immune system and various lymphokines and cytokines, drugs with specific effects on the immune system have beendeveloped such as 1997). Immunosuppressive drug therapy is generally more effective in controlling disease in young animals than in aged animals. This is because immune disorders in youngeranimals often occur in the face of a relatively intact, or even hyperactive, immune system,while immune disorders in older animals often occurs because of degeneration of the immune system. An intact immune system is more amenable to various modulations than an immune system that is deficient. Accessory drugs (drugs in addition to steroids) should be withdrawn once the disease is in complete remission for at least one month or more, depending on how long it took toachieve remission. During the same period the glucocorticoid dosage also should havebeen incrementally decreased as clinical improvement occurred. By the time completeN.C. Pedersen / Veterinary Immunology and Immunopathology 69 (1999) 251-342 319remission of disease occurs, the glucocorticoids should have already been reduced to maintenance levels. If signs reappear when the animal is receiving glucocorticoids alone,re-establish remission with combination therapy, then maintain remission with the lowestpossible dosages of glucocorticoid and cytotoxic drugs. If the disease remains inremission for at least two to three months on steroids alone, the glucocorticoids can bewithdrawn. The biggest mistake made is to decrease drug dosages too rapidly and tofollow a rigid time schedule for treatment. As long as steady, albeit slow, improvement is seen, vigorous therapy should be continued. Decreased levels or discontinuation of drugs should only follow substantial degrees of improvement. Therapy should never becompletely discontinued when there is active disease present, even though it appearsslight. 9.1. Glucocorticoid therapy Almost all treatment regimens have a glucocorticoid as the sole treatment agent, or as the main drug in a combination of agents. This is because glucocorticoids strongly synergize with the anti-inflammatory and/or immunomodulating effects of a number ofagents, including cytotoxic and even specific likecyclosporine. Interestingly, non-steroidal immunosuppressive drugs usually do not worknearly as well as glucocorticoids as sole therapeutic agents. Therefore, immunologicdiseases that do not respond even partially to high dose glucocorticoids will probably notrespond very well to combination drug therapy. Conversely, if there is partial response tohigh dose glucocorticoids, there will usually be an enhanced or synergistic response to combination therapy. Combination therapy is used under three general circumstances: 1. when there is only a partial response to steroid therapy alone; 2. when disease can only be controlled with levels of glucocorticoids that are detrimental to the animal's health; or 3. when it is desirable to achieve disease remission more rapidly; When several drugs are used in combination, the effective dosage of each drug is often reduced. This reduces toxicity while retaining or even enhancing total therapeuticefficacy. The obvious question is 'when should glucocorticoids be used alone, and whenshould combination immunosuppressive therapy be initiated?' This decision is based onthe familiarity of the veterinarian with the use of these drugs and his/her experience withtreating a number of actual cases of the disease in question. Many veterinarians, however,will rely on high dosages of glucocorticoids to control conditions that can be moreeffectively and safely treated with combination therapy. These same veterinarians are also willing to accept partial control of diseases using steroids alone, even though better control could have been achieved with combination therapy. Prednisone, prednisolone, and dexamethasone are the most commonly used glucocorticoids in combination immunosuppressive drug therapy. The main differencesamong these glucocorticoids are in their relative potencies; dexamethosone isaround seven times more potent per mg than prednisone or prednisolone. Prednisone is320 N.C. Pedersen / Veterinary Immunology and Immunopathology 69 (1999) 251-342metabolized to prednisolone in the body, and the latter is the active moiety. Therefore, there might be some advantage to giving prednisolone over prednisone,especially if there are liver problems. In reality, the two drugs can be usedinterchangeably. Glucocorticoids exert their immunosuppressive effects in various ways. Glucocorti- coids are not highly suppressive to normal primary and secondary antibody responses attherapeutic dosages, although they do seem to markedly depress abnormal autoantibody formation (i.e., Coomb's antibody, antiplatelet antibodies, antinuclear antibodies, and so on). In this regard, they appear to have a favorable regulating effect on events leading toabnormal antibody production. Glucocorticoids cause a pronounced lymphopenia, whichlimits the number of these cells available for participation in cell-mediated processes.Glucocorticoids may reduce specific antigen-induced blastogenesis of lymphocytes.These drugs produce a monocytosis, but diminish the response of these cells to someinflammatory mediators. Monocyte function in vitro and in vivo is decreased. This effectis manifested systemically by a decrease in the uptake of opsonized and nonopsonized materials by the reticuloendothelial system and locally by a decreased influx of monocytes into inflammatory sites. The reticuloendothelial blockade effect has obviousbenefits in the control of red cell and thrombocyte destruction in autoimmune hemolyticanemia and thrombocytopenia. Glucocorticoids inhibit the production of interferons, and interleukins-1 and -2, and affect neutrophil function. They increase blood neutrophil levels by stimulating theirrelease from the marrow; paradoxically, glucocorticoids inhibit the migration ofneutrophils from the blood into the inflammatory site. They also impair neutrophil chemotaxis, adhesiveness, bacterial killing, and greatly reduce the number of circulating eosinophils. There are several miscellaneous effects of glucocorticoids that may be of benefit in the treatment of immunologic diseases. Glucocorticoids appear to depress serum complementlevels. They also interfere with the passage of immune complexes through basementmembranes. Both of these effects have obvious benefits in the treatment of immunecomplex-mediated disorders. Corticosteroids should be used at the highest dosage levels during the first 1-2 weeks to control the disease and then decrease the dosage slowly and stepwise at 2-4 week intervals as long as there is a continuous and significant improvement. Improvementshould be gauged by measurable parameters such as RBC numbers, platelet numbers,joint fluid cytology, etc., and not just outward signs of health. The initial dosage shouldnot exceed 2.0-4.0 mg/kg PO per day, except in very small dogs and cats, in whom thedosage may be greater. When giving these initial high levels, it is beneficial to administerthe drug in divided daily doses. Once the clinical signs have disappeared, glucocorticoid levels should be decreased over a several weeks to maintenance levels. Maintenance levels of prednisone or prednisolone should be \u00191.0 mg/kg PO every other day, or lower if possible. Do not discontinue glucocorticoid therapy for at least one to three months after the disease is inremission; the longer it takes to achieve remission, the longer the animal should bemaintained in remission. If drugs are discontinued too soon the disease is more likely torecur and the disease-free interval will often be shorter.N.C. Pedersen / Veterinary Immunology and Immunopathology 69 (1999) 251-342 3219.2. Cytotoxic drugs Glucocorticoids are often used in conjunction with any one of a number of different cytotoxic drugs. The term 'cytotoxic drug' refers to the drug's ability to kill cancer cells,for which most of them were initially developed. Cytotoxic drugs also have potent effectson the immune system and are often anti-inflammatory as well. Cytotoxic immunosup- pressive drugs used in veterinary medicine belong groups: alkylating agents; thiopurines; and vinca alkaloids. as methotrexate,compose a fourth group. Methotrexate, however, is too toxic to be considered for routineuse. 9.2.1. Alkylating agents Alkylating agents have been found to be among the most potent immunosuppressive drugs available. Alkylating agents work by cross linking the DNA of both dividing andresting cells. They also alkylate nucleic acids; alkylated guanine will with thymine instead of cytosine, thus causing a misreading of the genetic code. They produce most of their effects, therefore, by interfering with cell division. Cyclophosphamide (Cytoxan)and chlorambucil (Leukeran) are the most potent immunosuppressive agents in thisgroup. Alkylating agents act against many arms of the immune response. They inhibitnormal primary and secondary responses as well as delayed hypersensitivity reactions.They prolong the survival of organ grafts, decrease the production of interferon, diminishantigen trapping in lymph nodes, and inhibit local inflammatory responses. Alkylatingagents act on lymphoid cells by killing slowly proliferating antigen reactive cells as well as rapidly proliferating specifically stimulated cells. As such, they inhibit antibody synthesis from 48 h before to a week or more after antigen administration. Cyclophosphamide is the most popular of the alkylating agents. It is usually given at a dosage based on the body surface area rather than on body weight. This is also true of theother cytotoxic drugs that will be discussed later. Larger dogs require less of the drug perkilogram of body weight than small dogs and cats. Cyclophosphamide is given at adosage of 1.50 mg/kg PO daily for dogs >25 kg, 2.0 mg/kg PO daily for dogs 5-25 kg,and 2.50 mg/kg PO daily for dogs under 5 kg and cats. Cyclophosphamide is given daily for four consecutive days of each week, followed by three days with no drug; this is referred to as one cycle of therapy. Cyclophosphamide can also be given at the previouslymentioned dosage on an alternate-day basis. Chlorambucil has been much less utilized than cyclophosphamide for the treatment of immunologic diseases. In humans, it has been most effective in the treatment of a numberof glomerulonephritides, such as lupus nephritis and idiopathic nephrotic syndrome ofchildren. In these diseases of humans, chlorambucil has been shown to be much moreeffective than cyclophosphamide and has fewer side effects. The impression in animals has been that it is less effective than cyclophosphamide as an immunosuppressive agent, but that the decrease in efficacy is compensated for by its lesser toxicity. This drug willprobably see increasing usage in veterinary medicine for the treatment of immunologicdiseases as clinicians learn to use it to treat more conditions. Chlorambucil is given at adosage of about 1 mg/15 kg (0.07 mg/kg) PO, once daily, for animals in the 15- to 30-kgweight range. Smaller dogs should receive about 0.08 mg/kg and larger dogs about322 N.C. Pedersen / Veterinary Immunology and Immunopathology 69 (1999) 251-3420.06 mg/kg PO once daily. After remission is achieved, the drug should be administered at the previously mentioned dosage once every other day. Cyclophosphamide and chlorambucil have several potential side effects at the prescribed dosages. They can be bone marrow suppressive in some animals. For thisreason, blood counts should be done every two weeks for the first two months of therapyand monthly or bimonthly thereafter. The white blood cell counts should not be allowedto go lower than 5000/ul. If this occurs, the drug should be briefly discontinued and reinstituted at three-fourths the original dose. A sterile hemorrhagic cystitis is a common side effect of chronic cyclophosphamide therapy. For this reason, cyclophosphamideshould not be used for periods longer than three to four months. If cytotoxic drug therapyis required after this period of time, chlorambucil or azathioprine should be substitutedfor cyclophosphamide. Neither of these drugs induces sterile hemorrhagic cystitis.Cyclophosphamide and chlorambucil retard new hair growth in shaved areas. 9.2.2. Thiopurines Thiopurines achieve their effect by competing with adenine in the synthesis of nucleic acids. The net result of the substitution of nucleic acids with these 'non-sense' bases is an inoperable nucleic acid strand. Thiopurines, therefore, prevent the proliferation of rapidlydividing cell populations. This differs from the effect of cyclophosphamide, which worksagainst resting and slowly dividing cells as well. Azathioprine (Imuran) and 6-mercaptopurine (Purinethol) are the most widely used of the thiopurine compounds. Azathioprine is cleaved in the body to two molecules of 6-mercaptopurine, which is the active moiety. These two drugs can, therefore, be usedinterchangeably. The thiopurines strongly inhibit T-lymphocyte-related functions such as cell-mediated immunity and T-lymphocyte-dependent antibody synthesis. For optimum effect, they must be given during the stage of immune response in which cells are rapidlydividing. The thiopurines have been useful in preventing allograft rejection and have aparticularly strong inhibitory effect on the expression of delayed hypersensitivity. Theyalso have a potent inhibitory effect on the non-specific inflammatory response, whichmay be due in part to inhibition of the influx of mononuclear cells into the site. Thethiopurines are potent inhibitors of the primary humoral antibody response. Inhibition ofthe secondary antibody response requires higher levels of the drugs. The thiopurines have been used successfully to treat many autoimmune disorders of humans. These drugs have been beneficial in the treatment of autoimmune hemolyticanemia, pure red cell aplasia, Crohn's disease, pemphigus vulgaris, used in a number of diseases of dogs, such as immune cytopenias,idiopathic polyarthritis, systemic lupus erythematosus, and the bullous dermatitides. The dosages for azathioprine and 6-mercaptopurine are the same, about 2.0 mg/kg PO once daily. When the disease is under control, alternate-day therapy is used at the dosage previously mentioned. With alternate-day therapy, the glucocorticoids and the thiopurinesare given on consecutive days. Used at the recommended dosages, azathioprine and 6-mercaptopurine are safe drugs. They are potentially bone marrow suppressive (Rinkardtand Kruth, 1996) and gastrointestinal toxic at higher levels. As with the use of allN.C. Pedersen / Veterinary Immunology and Immunopathology 69 (1999) 251-342 323cytotoxic drugs, it is recommended that the white blood cell counts be monitored every 1-2 weeks for the first 6-8 weeks of therapy and not allowed to fall below 5000/ul. If thewhite cell counts fall below this level, the drug should be discontinued for 1-2 weeks andreinstituted at 1/2 to 3/4 the dosage. Like the alkylating the thiopurines retard hairgrowth. 9.2.3. Vinca alkaloids Vinca alkaloids are used for the treatment of certain cancers in animals and humans. Vincristine (Oncovin) is the most widely used drug of this group. Vincristine inhibits the formation of the cytoplasmic microtubular network and prevents cell division byinterfering with the formation of the mitotic spindle. Because phagocytosis also involvesthe cytoplasmic to have only 1/10 to 1/100 the immunosuppressive effect of drugs such ascyclophosphamide. Their most potent immunosuppressive effect is at nearly toxic levels.The sole use of vincristine in immunologic disorders is the treatment of autoimmunethrombocytopenia in humans and animals. In addition to its effect on phagocytosis of abnormal platelets, the drug has a curious thrombocytotic property that actually increases the production of platelets. The dosage of vincristine for dogs is about 0.02 mg/kg IV once a week. If it is going to be effective, a dramatic rise in the platelet count will occur within four to six days afterthe first injection or several days after the second injection. Therapy is discontinued if noresponse is seen after the second dose. Vincristine is recommended for use in cases ofthrombocytopenia in three situations: 1. in animals with severe blood loss; vincristine often gives a much more rapid response than prednisone or prednisolone alone; 2. in animals with a poor or negligible response to glucocorticoids; or3. in animals that fail to respond to glucocorticoids and splenectomy. Vincristine and splenectomy have an apparent additive effect, even if no response occured to splenectomy alone. Most cases of thrombocytopenia of immune origin respond well toglucocorticoids alone and do not require vincristine therapy. Even when vincristine is used, it should be combined with glucocorticoid therapy to facilitate and maintain remission once it is achieved. Side-effects are generally less than other cytotoxic drugs,especially when limited to one or two doses. Side-effects include severe perivascularreactions if injected out of the vein, leukopenia with a nadir 4-10 days after injection, andperipheral neuropathy. 9.2.4. Gold salts (crysotherapy) Gold is the oldest of all immunosuppressive drugs and was first used by Koch in 1890 for the treatment of tuberculosis. It was later used with some success for treatment of SLE and RA, thought at one time to be forms of tuberculosis. Gold is available as aurothioglucose (Solganol, Schering) or gold sodium thiomalate (Mycochrysine, Merck). Aurothioglucose has less acute anaphylactic reactions and isthe drug of choice. It is available as a suspension containing 50 mg/ml of gold. The324 N.C. Pedersen / Veterinary Immunology and Immunopathology 69 (1999) 251-342dosage for dogs is 1 mg/kg IM every week for six to eight weeks, then 1 mg/kg once a month. Gold is excreted from the body in the urine (50-85%) and in the feces. Only 30-50% of the administered dose is excreted each week. The level of gold in the bodyprogressively increases, therefore, with each weekly dose. Gold levels are maintainedthereafter by the once monthly injections. Residual gold can still be found years aftertherapy ceases. The precise mode of action of gold salts is unknown. The maximum therapeutic effect often takes from six to eight weeks or more to obtain. Gold stabilizes lysosomal enzymes,inhibits certain leukocyte enzyme systems, decreases the migration of cellsinto sites of inflammation, diminishes phagocytic activity, inactivates complementcomponents, inhibits prostaglandin synthesis, inhibits antigen and mitogen inducedlymphocyte proliferation, suppresses immunoglobulin synthesis, and stabilizes collagen.It has also been found to decrease immunoglobulin levels, rheumatoid factor levels, andautoantibody levels in pemphigus foliaceous. Chrysotherapy is used as an adjuvant to glucocorticoid and glucocorticoid-cytotoxic drug therapy. It is seldom effective as the sole immunosuppressive agent. It will, however,reduce the effective therapeutic dose of corticosteroids and in this way reduce cortisoneside-effects. Because gold takes many weeks to reach its maximum level of efficacy, it isoften combined initially with glucocorticoids and cytotoxic drugs. By the time remissionis achieved, the gold is starting to take effect. Once remission is achieved, the cytotoxicdrugs are withdrawn and an attempt is made to maintain the remission on glucocorticoidsand gold salts alone. If the remission is sustained, the dosage of glucocorticoid is slowly reduced and in some cases withdrawn. If the addition of gold to the therapy fails to provide significant benefit after six weeks of weekly treatments, the drug should bediscontinued. If after six weeks a good response is noted, gold treatment can be continuedon a monthly basis. Chrysotherapy has been used to treat the bullous diseases, idiopathic polyarthritis, vasculitis, and rheumatoid arthritis in dogs. In man, the use of gold salts has been counter-indicated for the treatment of SLE. Some dogs with SLE, however, seem to respondfavorably to gold therapy. Less than 5-10% of dogs on chronic chrysotherapy will develop thrombocytopenia, toxic nephritis, oral and epidermal necrolysis.With the exception of the nephritis, these side-effects will usually clear up when the drugis withdrawn. Recovery can take several weeks or months, however. Additional side-effects in man include dermatitis, proteinuria, GI upsets, neurologic reactions,hepatopathies, and acute anaphylactic reactions. 9.2.5. Cyclosporine A Cyclosporine is available in injectable (IV) and can be incorporated with olive oil and used as an eye drop. Cyclosporine is readily absorbed into the blood from theconjunctival sac. The canine dosage is 5 mg/kg IV, q 12 h for several days to establish blood levels and then 10-35 mg/kg PO, q 12 h thereafter. Blood levels achieved after oral administrationN.C. Pedersen / Veterinary Immunology and Immunopathology 69 (1999) 251-342 325vary greatly depending on the individual. Therefore, adjust oral dosage to achieve trough (taken just prior to second date) whole blood levels of about 500 ng/ml. Cyclosporine is the first of a new generation of immunosuppressive drugs that are relatively specific in their modes of action. Cyclosporine causes T-cells to remain in aresting phase in response to activation signals. It works specifically on T-helper/cytotoxiccells (CD4\u0087T-cells) and spares T-suppressor cells (CD8 cyclophillin to block T-cell signal transduction and activation. It increases the production of IL-1 by macrophages and IL-2 by CD4 \u0087T-cells. Cyclosporine also inhibits B-cell growth factor and inhibits the cidal activity of macrophases in response toginterferon. Cyclosporine, used in combination with prednisone, is an effective treatment for autoimmune disorders such as IHA and ITP. Cyclosporine also appears to hold somepromise for the treatment of bullous diseases in man and animals. Cyclosporine eye dropshave proved effective in one-half or so of the cases of keratitis sicca in dogs. The drug ishighly synergistic with glucocorticoids and combination therapy minimizes the toxicity of both drugs and provides maximal therapeutic benefit. Cyclosporine therapy, especially for larger dogs, is currently very expensive. The oral administration of ketaconazole canbe used to reduce substantially the oral dose of cyclosporine needed to maintain effectiveblood levels (Dahlinger et al., 1998); the total cost saving being ca. 25%. 9.2.6. Leflunomide Leflunomide was developed originally as an anti-inflammatory drug, but was found to be far more active against a wide range of immune disorders in murine models. Thesemodels include asthma, SLE, chronic graft versus host disease, autoimmune tubulointerstitial nephritis, anti-basement membrane glomerulonephritis, Wennberg et al., 1997; Xu et al., 1997; Yeh et al., 1996,1997). The drug significantly decreases disease-specific antibody formation. Lefluno-mide has also shown great promise in the treatment of rheumatoid arthritis in people(Mladenovic et al., 1995; Rozman, 1998), and is undergoing trials for SLE (Strand,1997). Leflunomide has an antiproliferative effect on T-cell dependent and independent antibody synthesis (Silva Jaunior and Morris, 1997). The drug has no effect on the release of cytokines, but antagonizes the action of interleukins-3 and -4, and G-CSF, GM-CSFand TNF- a(Cao et al., 1996). It has no effect on IL-1 or IFN- g. Recently, leflunomide has been shown to inhibit pyrimidine synthesis, and this inhibition can be reversed by freeuridine (Fox, 1998; Zielinski et tyrosine kinase Jaunior and Morris, 1997;Xu et al., 1995). Leflunomide has many potential uses in veterinary medicine. When used with prednisone and cyclosporine A, it will virtually eliminate allograft rejection responses. It has made it possible to transplant dogs, which are notorious for the violence of theirrejection responses, even with prednisone and cyclosporine A treatment (Lirtzman et al.,1996). Leflunomide has also shown great promise in the treatment of immune diseases indogs (Gregory et al., 1998). One of the metabolites of Leflunomide, trifluromethylaniline326 N.C. Pedersen / Veterinary Immunology and Immunopathology 69 (1999) 251-342(TFMA), is highly gastroenterotoxic for dogs. Therefore, the dose and dosage regimen must be closely followed. The drug is teratogenic in rats, so long-term use may lead to anincrease in certain neoplasms. The dose for dogs is \u00192-6 mg/kg/day per os until a serum trough level of 30 ug/ml is achieved. 9.2.7. Danazol Danazol is a non-virilizing androgen that has been used for the treatment of refractory immune-mediated hematologic disorders and SLE in man (Cervera et al., 1995). Danazolis thought to work by decreasing the density of Fc receptors on macrophages. Fcreceptors bind the Fc portion of platelet bound immunoglobulin and facilitate the macrophage-mediated destruction of the antibody coated platelets. About 20% of the human cases of immune-mediated thrombocytopenia refractory to standard therapy willrespond to Danazol within 4-8 weeks, and it has been advocated for use in dogs for thispurpose (Miller, 1997). It has also been used to treat a dog with an Evan's-like syndrome(Holloway et al., 1990). Danazol comes in oral tablets and the dosage is 5-10 mg/kg p.o. daily for at least eight weeks. If no response in eight weeks, discontinue its use. If it proves effective, treat for 4-6 months, and then try to take off drug or reduce dosage. There have been no noticeable side-effects associated with its use in dogs. Although highly touted when first reported, its effectiveness in both humans and dogs has not met expectations. 9.2.8. Intravenous immunoglobulin Intravenous administration of gglobulin has been of therapeutic benefit in people with IHA and ITP, as well as other immune disorders. In one study, human gglobulin given intravenously has been shown to provide some short-term benefits when given todogs with IHA, but did not improve long-term survival (Scott-Moncrieff andReagan, 1997; Scott-Moncrieff et al., 1997). Human immune globulin was also givento 13 of 37 dogs with IHA that had failed to respond to glucocorticoids after seven days;the addition of the globulin appeared beneficial in 10/13 of these animals (Kellerman and Bruyette, 1997). Further studies need to be done using canine rather than human gamma globulin. 9.2.9. Splenectomy Splenectomy is commonly used for the adult forms of ITP in humans and for some cases of IHA. It should be considered a treatment of last resort in animals, however. Itsuse should be limited to the following situations: (1) when a satisfactory remission cannotbe obtained with single or combination drug therapy alone; (2) when an animal isshowing toxicity to the chronic drug therapy needed to maintain remission and either thedrugs need to be eliminated altogether or their dosage needs to be decreased. Mixedresults have been described for splenectomy in dogs. In one study of IHA, ITP and Evan's syndrome, splenectomy was found to reduce, but not eliminate, the need for immunosuppressive drugs in 8/9 dogs (Feldman et al., 1985). In another study of dogswith ITP, 4/5 dogs with relapsing and hard to medically control disease were able to gooff of all drugs after splenectomy (Jans et al., 1990).N.C.
