Therefore, it is highly recommended that you detox in a medically assisted environment so healthcare providers can monitor your vitals and ensure comfort and safety as your body expels the substances. Currently, there are no approved guidelines for treating kratom use disorder. Some studies suggest that [buprenorphine can be used to treat kratom](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/29944481/) dependence and underlying chronic pain that drives it use. [Jana Wu](https://mountainside.com/people/jana-wu/), Director of Cultural Integration, shares that, \"For my clients struggling with kratom use disorder, suboxone appears to be an effective remedy for relieving their drug cravings. Those taking suboxone reported having an increase in energy and a decrease in depressive mood and anxiety.\" Other treatment routes may include behavioral therapy, support groups, and holistic practices. Behavioral therapy can help individuals learn new coping strategies and address underlying mental health concerns. Support groups can provide a sense of community and accountability. Dr. Dwenger adds that yoga, acupuncture, and massage therapy are safe pain management alternatives and promote healing for the mind, body, and spirit. As more research emerges, we will better understand how kratom affects people over time, and best treatment practices. "}
