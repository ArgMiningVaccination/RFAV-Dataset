What do you think is essential for everyone to know? \u2014Inspired by Peter Wang, Class of 2022 Subway maps, evolutionary trees, Lewis diagrams.

Destroy a question with your answer. \u2014Inspired by Aleksandra Ciric Shoitsu (1202-80) Superstring theory has revolutionized speculation about the physical world by suggesting that strings play a pivotal role in the universe. Strings, however, always have explained or enriched our lives, from Theseus's escape route from the Labyrinth, to kittens playing with balls of yarn, to the single hair that held the sword above Damocles, to the Old Norse tradition that one's life is a thread woven into a tapestry of fate, to the beautiful sounds of the finely tuned string of a violin, to the children's game of cat's cradle, to the concept of stringing someone along. Use the power of string to explain the biggest or the smallest phenomenon. \u2014Inspired by Adam Sobolweski Have you ever walked through the aisles of a warehouse store like Costco or Sam's Club and wondered who would buy a jar of mustard a foot and a half tall?

Write an essay somehow inspired by super-huge mustard. \u2014Inspired by Katherine Gold People often think of language as a connector, something that brings people together by helping them share experiences, feelings, ideas, etc. We, however, are interested in how language sets people apart.

You may want to think about subtle riffs or idiosyncrasies based on cadence, rhythm, rhyme, or (mis)pronunciation. \u2014Inspired by Kimberly Traube In 2015, the city of Melbourne, Australia created a \"tree-mail\" service, in which all of the trees in the city received an email address so that residents could report any tree-related issues.

Imagine this has been expanded to any object (tree or otherwise) in the world, and share with us the letter you'd send to your favorite. -Inspired by Hannah Lu, Class of 2020 You're on a voyage in the thirteenth century, sailing across the tempestuous seas. What if, suddenly, you fell off the edge of the Earth? -Inspired by Chandani Latey, AB'93 The word floccinaucinihilipilification is the act or habit of describing or regarding something as unimportant or of having no value.

Alohomora. Noisy roommate? Quietus. Feel the need to shatter windows for some reason? Finestra. Create your own spell, charm, jinx, or other means for magical mayhem. How is it enacted? Is there an incantation? Does it involve a potion or other magical object? If so, what's in it or what is it? What does it do? -Inspired by Emma Sorkin, Class of 2021 Imagine you've struck a deal with the Dean of Admissions himself, Dean Nondorf. It goes as follows: you're guaranteed admission to the University of Chicago regardless of any circumstances that arise. This bond is grounded on the condition that you'll obtain a blank, 8.5 x 11 piece of paper, and draw, write, sketch, shade, stencil, paint etc., anything and everything you want on it; your only limitations will be the boundaries of both sides on the single page. Now the catch... your submission, for the rest of your life, will always be the first thing anyone you meet for the first time will see. Whether it's at a job interview, a blind date, arrival at your first Humanities class, before you even say, \"hey,\" they'll already have seen your page, and formulated that first impression. Show us your page. What's on it, and why? If your piece is largely or exclusively visual, please make sure to share a creator's accompanying statement of at least 300 words, which we will happily allow to be on its own, separate page. PS: This is a creative thought experiment, and selecting this essay prompt does not guarantee your admission to UChicago. -Inspired by Amandeep Singh Ahluwalia, Class of 2022 Cats have nine lives, Pac-Man has three lives, and radioactive isotopes have half-lives.
