GoddessCeremony is a global platform for women's wellness and healing. Through powerful women's retreats and women's circle leadership trainings, we are here to empower you through your journey so you can rise into who you were born to become. Our work has been featured in Elephant Journal, MindBodyGreen and on over 50 interviews and podcasts because we believe all women deserve support, community and sisterhood. Welcome! The simple truth is this: few of us learned how to trust our intuition or lead empowered lives. Instead, many of us have struggled for years with fear, imposter syndrome and a disconnect from our body. Over a few decades, this can greatly weigh on a person. For a lot of us, our healing journey probably didn't happen overnight. Instead, it likely included dozens of yoga classes. Deep emotional releases. Long journal entries. A hunger for connection and meaning. \"MOST OF US DID NOT GROW UP WITH TOOLS TO LEAD EMPOWERED LIVES. INSTEAD, MANY OF US HAD TO CARVE OUR OWN PATHS TO RE-DISCOVER WHO WE TRULY ARE.\" AND NOW, HERE YOU ARE. GUIDED HERE FOR A REASON. We believe you were born with a mission and we help you rise into that calling. By shedding the old beliefs and reconnecting to your wisdom, you will emerge from this time of deep healing an embodied woman. Trust your intuition and take a leap that you know will serve you. Join us for a [retreat](https://www.goddessceremony.com/retreats) or rise into a [women's circle leader](https://www.goddessceremony.com/certifiedcreatrix) and begin your journey with us! MY NAME IS CASSANDRA WILDER, and I'm so grateful you're here. GoddessCeremony and my work as a Naturopathic Doctor has grown rapidly over the years, but I did not start here. Years ago I was exiting an abusive relationship that just about broke me and in that dark moment realized: I didn't know who I was. While I was checking the boxes of success with my corporate job, at night in bed I felt a pit of emptiness. When I decided to trust my gut and leave it all behind, I left to travel with a desire to find my purpose in the world. Discovering women's circles gave me the insights and healing I had needed for so long and after traveling to attend every circle and workshop I could find, I moved back to the states to start my schooling as a ND. It was here that GoddessCeremony was created with the simple intention to help women heal themselves. Today, we've helped thousands of women rise into their purpose, and we look forward to walking this journey with you, too.
