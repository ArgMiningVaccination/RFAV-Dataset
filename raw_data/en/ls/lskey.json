According to Traditional Chinese Medicine philosophy, your body, mind, and spirit are pieces of an interdependent energetic whole. Optimal health comes when the parts are in balance. To enhance my patients 'healing journey I may recommend a combination of TCM techniques. In addition to acupuncture, I offer TDP Lamp, moxa, ear acupuncture: needles, tacks or seeds, E-stim TDP Lamp TDP stands for \"Teding Diancibo Pu,\" which translates to \"special electromagnetic spectrum.\" These lamps emit electromagnetic radiation that has therapeutic benefits for a wide range of health conditions. One of the most notable benefits is their ability to help reduce pain and inflammation in the body. This is because the electromagnetic radiation emitted by the lamp is able to penetrate deep into the tissues, stimulating blood circulation and oxygenation. This increased blood flow can help to speed up the healing process and reduce inflammation, making it an effective tool for treating conditions such as arthritis, back pain, and muscle strains. Moxa Moxa or moxibustion is a method of heating specific acupuncture points on the body by burning an herb material close to the skin. This technique can be used alone or in combination with acupuncture - the Chinese character for acupuncture means \"acupuncture-moxibustion.\" [Moxibustion](https://homeopathy.md/moxibustion-acupuncture-calgary/) can be used to prevent diseases and maintain health as part of tonification treatments to help strengthen the organs and immune system. It warms the meridians and expels Cold. It can be used to promote circulation over areas of chronic pain or muscle tension. It is especially used for pain that is worse with exposure to cold or damp weather, as with some types of arthritis pain. When applied to acupuncture points that strengthen and lift the Qi, moxibustion can boost the immune system and help with fatigue, digestive issues, and much more. Keep in mind that there are many uses for moxa but there are some instances where it should be avoided. Talk to your practitioner to see if mugwort is right for you. Ear acupuncture Ear acupuncture, or auriculotherapy refers to acupressure or acupuncture applied to the ear. In TCM practice, we use auriculotherapy to treat a wide variety of health conditions- literally, anything from head to toe and all systems in between can be addressed! Ear acupuncture can be used successfully on its own or in combination with full-body acupuncture to enhance treatment results. Ear acupuncture and ear seeds stimulate the body to heal itself and help people feel calm, relaxed, more in their bodies, and less pain. E-stim Some patients have deep-rooted chronic or intense pain. In addition to other types of Traditional Chinese Medicine techniques, I may recommend E-stim. This technique involves application of a low-level, pulsating electrical current with the help of the specific device, electric acupuncture pen. It works by applying small electrical impulses to specific acupuncture points, muscles or nerve fibres. This stimulation helps alleviate pain, reduce inflammation and spasm, and improves the healing process. E-stim therapy is often used to relieve pain caused by chronic conditions such as arthritis, fibromyalgia, or any acute or chronic musculoskeletal pain. It's also useful in treating post-surgical pain, alleviate muscle spasm, as well as aid in the recovery from stroke. I also use it for natural labour induction when needed, at the end of pregnancy. Using the electric acupuncture pen gives the flexibility to adjust the strength and duration of the electrical impulses that suits the patients needs, making it an effective treatment for a wide range of conditions. Nutrition therapy 70% of our postnatal Qi (life force) comes from Gu Qi (Food Qi), which explains how important diet is for our health. Traditional Chinese Medicine nutrition is a fascinating subject that teaches us how to achieve our unique balance through eating and drinking, everyone is different! Western-based nutrition, with its emphasis on nutrients, vitamins, minerals, calories. Food in Traditional Chinese Medicine can be seen as medicine for one person and poison for another. In TCM nutrition, a balanced diet is one that includes all 5 tastes: spicy -warming, sour - cooling, bitter - cooling, sweet - strengthening, and salty - cooling. Foods that have a particular taste tend to have particular properties. TCM nutrition is unique in that it looks at the individual and their patterns and classifies food according to its effects on Yin and Yang balance. Yang energy is responsible for warming and activating body functions. For example, someone with Excess Cold wouldn't be given salads, raw veggies, and cold drinks. It would only worsen his or her condition. Conversely, a person who has Excess Heat wouldn't be given cayenne to boost their metabolism. Herbs and spices that are hot in property would only exacerbate a person's heat, dry out, and congeal the fluids in the body. With the help of acupuncture needles and TCM techniques I will help ease your physical and emotional pain by bringing your body back into balance. I will work with you to determine the best course of treatment for your specific needs. With optimal health restored, you can reach your full potential in all areas of your life.
