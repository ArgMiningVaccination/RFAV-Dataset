Twenty-two pounds of precious, raw ingredients are required to produce just a single jar. Thirty-eight rare herbs are slow-cooked at low temperatures to protect their vital nutrients. Our Amrit Kalash Ambrosia is a complex formula of 13 Ayurvedic botanicals that requires quality checks at every stage of processing\u2014from selection of raw material through packaging. The herbs are harvested at precise times to ensure maximum potency.. From an Ayurvedic standpoint, Blissful Joy helps to balance three important subdoshas (facets of wellbeing): Tarpaka Kapha, when in balance, contributes to a stable personality Prana Vata governs energy, creativity, perception, growth of consciousness and self-realization Sadhaka Pitta is responsible for balanced emotions, self-confidence, healthy desires, motivation and a feeling of fulfillment According to Vedic lore, humanity was steeped in suffering in ancient times. One day, the Devas (gods) and the Asuras (demons) resolved to find a solution; they churned the mighty ocean, and Amrit Kalash\u2014the Nectar of Immortality\u2014appeared to restore health and happiness to humanity. Many millennia later, in the 1980s, Maharishi Mahesh Yogi gathered preeminent Ayurvedic scholars and physicians in Noida, India, to create a powerful rasayana (rejuvenative) formula for mind, body, and spirit. The result was Amrit Kalash\u2014a full-spectrum antioxidant, rejuvenative formula that represents the ultimate of the ancient Vedic texts. Like Amrit Kalash, Blissful Joy is a rasayana\u2014a highly refined and powerful mixture of herbs, fruits and spices. In Ayurveda, rasayanas are renowned for their positive influence on mental and physical health, vitality, and longevity. These statements have not been evaluated by the Food and Drug Administration.
