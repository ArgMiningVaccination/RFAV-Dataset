Because people with Autism and other developmental disabilities and their families have been disproportionately impacted by the ongoing public health and economic emergency caused by COVID-19, the Autism Society of Greater Wisconsin is working to create community connections to increase access to a calm, supportive, and inclusive vaccine experience. The Autism Society of Greater Wisconsin is partnering with health agencies and other community partners to co-host Sensory Friendly Vaccine clinics. The clinics are open to Autistic children & adults, their family members, and anyone else who would benefit from a modified vaccination process. What makes a clinic Sensory Friendly? Sensory Friendly Vaccine Clinics are designed to provide a flexible, supportive, and calm environment during the vaccination process. While each clinic will look different, generally participants will have access to the following accommodations/tools: - Social narrative to prepare for the visit - One-on-one trained support staff - Visual schedule - Sensory fidgets - Shotblocker to help with injection pain - Buzzy Bee to help with injection pain - Sensory tools like weighted blankets, calming sensory water toys, noise canceling headphones, etc. - Other individualized accommodations can be arranged - please just ask! Feedback from Participating Families - Getting this done in a low stress, guilt free environment! It alleviated my own stress as a parent too, about being judged for my child's behavior. I appreciate the patience my children were shown, and getting to play afterwards helped create a more positive memory of the event, which will hopefully help the next time a vaccine is needed. This clinic was a game changer for my family. Thank you so much for putting it together! - Helping my daughter have a positive vaccination experience to help her move past her fears, and seeing her be so well respected by the staff/volunteers - The staff was wonderful, and our boys were completely comfortable and calm through what is typically a stressful situation. - This was as best of an experience my child could get for getting a shot- thank you for doing this for our children - This was such a wonderful event for kiddos. We loved that our boys were able to have a positive experience to associate with their vaccination. No tears were shed!! - This was a great experience! We would love to see this expand to include more vaccinations like the flu shot each year. - When we first checked in, the ladies downstairs were aware of my daughter's anxiety and made sure she was brought straight in without having to wait. It was a relief that people expected her and were prepared with extra patience and ready to make the experience as quick as possible.
