Here are common sleep recommendations for total hours of sleep (including naps): Newborns (0-3 months) : 14-17 hours per day Infants (4-11 months) : 12-15 hours per day Toddlers (1-2 years) : 11-14 hours per day Preschoolers (3-5 years) : 10-13 hours per day : 9-12 hours Teens (13-18 years): 8-10 hours There are two observations to be made about these sleep recommendations. First, because there is a range, we often interpret it to mean that if the length of time a child spends asleep falls within that range, then all is good. So, if an 8-month-old infant is getting 12 hours of sleep, including naps, and we see that the recommended range is 12-15 hours, then we feel everything is fine. But the reality is we don't know if a child is getting enough sleep unless we give them the opportunity to have 15 hours of sleep. How do we nurture our sense of well-being? By supporting the quieter aspects of childhood: sufficient sleep, rhythmic eating, lots of free movement, and playful exploration, as well as protection from different forms of excessive outside stimulation that in today's world want to come too soon and routinely risk being far too much. Getting enough sleep Infants need plenty of external soothing, but over time children become able to take on more of the self-soothing and settling process. There are, however, two additional important aspects to consider in order to complete our understanding of sleep development: first, we need to be sure a child gets enough total hours of daytime and nighttime sleep, and second, that there is an early enough bedtime. These are important because most adults do not, themselves, get enough sleep, and children need far more sleep than adults. Many behavioral and attention struggles are related to children not resting enough, and the problem is compounded when expectations for children's sleep are It is better to aim for providing the upper end of the range and then see where your child falls. The lower end of the range is probably not going to be enough sleep for 90% of children in that stage of development. How can you provide that much sleep time? Well, that leads to the second aspect, which is that most children do much better with an early bedtime. Toddlers do well with a 6:30- 7:00 pm bedtime (some even like 6:00 pm). Many preschoolers thrive with a 7:00 pm bedtime. That means not starting to get ready for bed at 7:00 pm, but actually getting into bed to fall asleep at 7:00 pm. For a 4-year-old that likes 12 hours of sleep but does not regularly nap, a 7:00 pm-7:00 am sleep pattern is needed in order to get 12 hours of sleep. The main hindrances for providing this kind of rhythm are the work schedules of adults, as well as the temptations for after-school activities. But we don't build our sense of well-being through extracurricular enrichment. The deeper we go along the inner sensory pathway, the more a child needs 'down time' to practice that kind of sensing. The first seven years of life are the most important time for developing a healthy sense of well-being, which sets up life-long patterns for how we will sense and connect to the needs of our own body. What if a child went all the way through childhood without ever really knowing what it feels like to be fully rested? What a loss. Learning to know when we are over-tired, and what it feels like to be well rested, are core aspects of the sense of well-being. Eating regular meals Just as we need time for both outward exploration and accompanying rest, all children similarly need rhythmic alternation between active eating and quiet digestion. Rhythmic eating actually reduces the need for parental reminding, herding, and cajoling of children to sit and eat. If breakfast comes predictably at 7:30 am each day, then at 7:20 am our body begins preparing for it with increased production of stomach acid and secretion of digestive enzymes. When children can lean in to a 7:30 am breakfast meal (or whatever time works for your family), they will be both more inwardly prepared to eat and more likely to want to sit down at the table. Providing predictable mealtimes, as well as a dedicated eating space, like a dining room or kitchen table, helps frame the whole activity of eating. Whenever we can eat without distraction we meet our food in a much more complete way, better able to sense both the food and our own response to it. Small snacks throughout the day are admittedly quick and easy, but they keep a child bouncing between hungry and not hungry, with their blood sugar going up and down. None of those little snacking meals bring the full experience of feeling: 'I know my hunger, I see my food, my body is quiet enough that I am not distracted, and I can eat until I know I am full.' Learning to know when we are full - when we've had enough and feel satisfied - are core aspects of the sense of well-being. Free movement and exploration With each step along the inner sensory pathway, children increase the number of ways they can orient themselves in the world. More sensing doorways mean more potential paths to an experience of well-being. It's helpful to remember that we essentially develop our sensing capacities through practice. During early body formation we grow the structures for vision, taste, smell, touch, balance, movement and well- being, but those are only the basic building blocks. We are born with two eyes, but research studies show that if one eye is mechanically blocked from receiving light the eye will become functionally blind; the brain does not connect to the eye and therefore cannot make use of any sensory input that later comes from it. We therefore need to look and gaze day after day in order to develop a healthy sense of vision. We need to touch - thousands, millions of times - by grabbing, pushing, pulling, squeezing, sliding, and crashing. We spin, climb, lean, dip, walk a beam, hang upside down, and swing to develop a healthy sense of balance. We run, jump, catch, speed, slow, turn, stop, and start again in order to develop a healthy sense of movement. The nice part about free movement and exploration is that you don't need to set up a specific set of experiences. You don't need to hire a tutor, just give children the space and time to listen to the messages coming from their inner world. \"The first seven years of life are the most important time for developing a healthy sense of well-being, which sets up life-long patterns for how we will sense and connect to the needs of our own body.\" \"First, we need to be sure a child gets enough total hours of daytime and nighttime sleep, and second, that there is an early enough bedtime.\" | 9 8 | Beyond Ecophobia: Reclaiming the Heart in Nature Education DAVID SOBEL A valuable resource book for parents and teachers to help nurture children's relationship with nature. 72pp | \u00a39.99 Educating for Balance and Resilience: Developmental Movement, Drawing, and Painting in Waldorf Education JEFF TUNKEY A compelling book for teachers that argues that a focus on posture, special orientation and coordination is as important to healthy child development as academic content. 170pp | \u00a320.00 Emil and Berta: The Origins of the Waldorf School Movement SOPHIA CHRISTINE MURPHY Draws on Emil Molt's diaries to trace the struggles, successes and breakthroughs encountered with the founding and cultivation of the first Waldorf school. 208pp | \u00a320.00 A Gift of Wonder: A True Story Showing School As It Should Be KIM ALLSUP A funny, poignant memoir of a teacher's six-year journey with her class, which also explores the nature of education and how to retain the element of wonder. 240pp | \u00a316.99A Handbook for Steiner-Waldorf Class Teachers KEVIN AVISON A useful and practical resource book for Steiner-Waldorf teachers with detailed suggestions and checklists for Classes 1-8. 144pp | Classes 1-8 | History of Waldorf Education Worldwide: 1919-1945 NANA G\u00d6BEL Traces the establishing years of the revolutionary schools movement.

Place your branch in a vase or pot. To stop the branch falling over, try adding some sand or stones in the bottom to hold it in place. 2. Next, create some beautiful paper hearts to hang on the 'tree'. You can cut these out from card or paper. A heart-shaped cookie cutter or cardboard template is useful to draw around. Younger children may enjoy painting pre-cut hearts while older children will enjoy the challenge of cutting hearts out themselves. 3. Decorate the hearts using paints or crayons. 4. Finally, place a length of looped string or wool between two hearts and glue them together. Allow your decoration to dry before hanging it on your tree. Alternatively, you can use a hole-punch and tie on the wool or string. The heart of the home is often the family table. This is where families of all different shapes and sizes find nourishment through food, as well as a sense of belonging. Preparing meals together can really strengthen this bond. Try this fun pizza - it's sweet, cold and healthy! You will need: 2 cups (500 g) unsweetened natural yoghurt of choice (we used coconut yoghurt) 2 cups (300 g) fresh or frozen berry of choice (to create a puree) 1 cup (100 g) natural granola 1 \u00bd cups (225 g) seasonal or frozen fruit to top 3 tablespoons maple syrup (to add to your fruit puree - optional)Method: 1. Wrap a large circular plate or tray with plastic wrap. 2. Spread your yoghurt out onto the wrapped plate to create the base. 3. Sprinkle the edge of the yoghurt circle with granola. 4. Add trimmed or frozen berries to a food processor or blender and pulse until smooth. 5. Add maple syrup to taste (optional), then gently spread the berry puree over the yoghurt. 6. Add the remaining sliced strawberries or seasonal fruit on top of the berry puree. 7. Freeze overnight before slicing and enjoying. Simple! Top tip: If using fresh berries, add a few tablespoons of water to the puree until you reach the desired consistency.

They seemed to be wearing funny hats! \"What are they?\" wondered Pomme. \"Your pumpkin seeds have sprouted!\" Dad said. Slowly the sprouts turned into plants and took off their hats. They grew and grew and grew. Summer came and the days were hot. Pomme helped Dad in the garden. It was hard work, and Pomme got thirsty. She drank and drank until it felt like there was a small lake in her tummy. \"Maybe my pumpkin plants got thirsty too this morning?\" wondered Pomme. But when she went to water them after lunch, the soil around each plant was already cool and wet. Sometimes the seeds were animals. Sometimes they were a universe of moons and suns and stars. It felt like a long wait for spring and planting time, but finally a morning came when Pomme didn't need her coat. \"Seeds like to lie snug in the earth,\" said Dad. \"A happy seed will grow well.\" One afternoon Pomme helped Dad make pumpkin soup. Dad cut off the pumpkin's cap and Pomme scooped out the seeds. \"You can sow them in spring,\" he said, and gave Pomme a basket to keep all her seeds safe once they were dry. Pomme played with the seeds all winter. They were smooth and felt nice to touch.Pomme fetched a trowel from the garden shed, which looked as though someone had swept and tidied it. She took the first seed from her basket and dug a tiny bed. Then she covered it with a blanket of soil and said, \"I hope you're nice and cosy, little seed!\" Pomme looked at the soil every day. One day there were shoots of green Introduce your class to the arrival of autumn with this extract from a heartwarming seasonal story from Admar Kwant about growing your own food, then share a bowl of delicious pumpkin soup - just like Pomme! Pomme and the Pumpkins One afternoon there was a thunderstorm. It was very loud. The heavy rain came too. \"I hope the rain doesn't wash away my pumpkin plants,\" thought Pomme. When the storm had passed, Pomme pulled on her rain boots and rushed outside to check. In the soil she saw little channels that had drained the rainwater away. Her plants were safe. Soon the pumpkin plants had a surprise for Pomme... A flower! More flowers opened. Pomme thought they looked like beautiful stars. Buzzing bees visited to collect nectar, and Pomme watched them fly away with gold on their fuzzy legs... Admar Kwant lives with her family in the Netherlands, by the edge of a lake. Her home life and love of nature inspire her drawing and painting. She regularly creates illustrations for Educare, a Dutch parenting magazine.

In Lottie, St Michael and the Lonely Dragon a brave child sees the good in a seemingly ferocious dragon. gathered round the table. With big, expectant eyes they watch everything that's happening. Once the room is ready, we place a little table in the middle, and on it the basket with polished apples and the candle. Now it's time to go to the washroom, where the children have their hair combed for the festive occasion, and each receive a tiny drop of aromatic oil to rub on their hands. In the hallway the adults take off their aprons, and then we process around the lit candle making the Michael gesture, bearing the little sword of Michael, and singing a suitable Michael song. Then we say the following Michael verse, which we also accompany with a gesture: After repeating both song and verse twice, the kindergarten teacher gives each child an apple from the basket, placing it in hands formed like a little bowl. We carry this apple to the festive table and place it on the serviette on the plate. After lighting the candles for We celebrate Michaelmas Day on September 29. Today a red cover lies on the seasonal nature table, which is decorated with colourful autumn leaves, foliage and perhaps sunflowers. In the middle stands the picture of Michael. When the first children arrive in the morning, we prepare the dough for the festive cake, which the children cover all over with thin apple slices. In some kindergartens, loaves or rolls are baked. Soon the rooms are filled with delicious aromas, and we all look forward to our morning snack. But first we polish the lovely red apples that are placed in a shallow basket, in the middle of which stands a candleholder with a big candle. Next we push the tables together to form a long table, as we sometimes do on festive days. It's usually the five- and six-year-olds who immediately gather to lay and decorate the festive table. One lays the tablemats, another the plates and spoons. On each plate we place a red or yellow paper serviette folded into a triangle, and on top of this a golden ribbon. Along the middle of the long table we put a red, narrowly folded cloth, and on this come vases of flowers and candles. By now almost all the children have left their play and our festive meal, the children, one after another, give their apple to an adult who cuts it crossways to reveal the star in the middle. The children are always amazed anew when they open up their apple themselves and find the star, hidden in the darkness of the apple, revealed like a wonder. Around the star some children will often discover little 'spraying star sparks'. After this, the children wrap their apples in the serviettes, tying them with the gold ribbon to take home with them. The apple is a central part of our Michaelmas festival because it is the archetypal fruit, and also the fruit of the tree of knowledge. Michael has a special connection with our cognitive faculties and powers of knowledge. After the festive meal, depending on the weather, we either go out into the garden or go for a walk. If the wind is blowing well, we may take a few sheets of folded paper and string, and let little 'dragons' flutter behind us. We end the day with a suitable fairy tale. - Freya Jaffke Celebrating Festivals With Children PB | 152pp | \u00a314.99Once there was a small, sleepy town nestled in rolling hills, protected by a thick wall. Late in summer, when the apples were ripe and juicy, the townsfolk had a day out to pick them. Lottie walked further than the others, to a tree she knew grew the sweetest fruit. She was high in the tree when suddenly a big blue head poked through the branches. A dragon! \"RAARGH!\" it bellowed. \"A little girl! For my breakfast!\" Lottie was indeed quite small, but she was also brave. \"I'd rather you didn't eat me,\" she said. \"Maybe we could be friends instead?\" The dragon looked startled and uncertain. Then, \"RAARGH!\" it roared again. \"Dragons have no friends!\" \"But everyone needs\u2014\" Lottie's words were cut off by an apple that flew through the air, hitting the dragon in the face. \"OWWW!\" the great beast howled. \"Run Lottie! Now!\" shouted her big brother, Thomas, who had come looking for her. \"Wait!\" urged Lottie. But Thomas dragged her back towards the town, shouting \"Dragon! DRAGON!\" Everyone screamed, and raced to the safety of the town wall, with the angry beast following closely behind. The dragon kept bellowing all day, scorching the wall with red-hot flames. The townsfolk were terrified. Except for Lottie. She climbed high on the wall to speak to the dragon, but it was too angry to listen. While she fed her chickens that evening, Lottie chatted to them quietly. \"Hear that roaring dragon? It sounds scary, but I think underneath it might just be lonely.\" She decided she would try again to talk to it. But the town mayor wouldn't let her leave. \"A little girl like you would be gobbled up,\" he insisted. \"Tomorrow morning, the great knight St Michael will ride out and slay the beast.\" Killing the dragon seemed all wrong to Lottie. That night, while everyone slept, she searched for St Michael, and found him in the chapel.St Michael was a great knight, but he had never fought a dragon and he was frightened. He had been praying for bravery. \"St Michael,\" said Lottie, stepping in the chapel door, \"can I talk to you?\" St Michael stopped and listened... Discover the rest of the story in Lottie, St Michael and the Lonely Dragon! When we come to the golden door Michael stands there before: With his great sword of light he girds the earth in the blessing of his words. - E.

When would I have had time?\" Fox sputtered. \"I've been running from party to party every day! I think you're the ones who ate the butter and now you're blaming me! I can prove it: we'll all go over there and lie down in the sun. If grease dribbles from somebody's mouth, then they're the greedy glutton who ate the butter!\" Bear and Wolf agreed, sure that Fox would be proved guilty. They lay down to rest in the warm morning sun. Stiff and sore from their hard work felling and clearing, the bear and the wolf fell sound asleep right away. Quickly and quietly, Fox scraped up the very last of the butter and gently smeared it on the muzzles of his sleeping companions. As soon as the butter began to melt, he woke them both, shouting, \"Up, up, you thieves! Butter's dripping from your mouths!\" With great shame, the bear and the wolf saw that this was in fact true. Neither of them knew how it could have happened, but both suspected that it was a trick of the devious fox. Angry and hungry, Bear and Wolf stomped off back to the forest, determined not to be fooled by the fox again. Fox watched them go, and smiled his foxy smile. Then he curled up in the warm morning sun and settled down for a nice long nap. \"I deserve a bit of a rest,\" he thought to himself. After all, getting the better of his friends had been such very tiring work. In the morning Fox had no interest in working. All of his thoughts were centred on how he could get his paws on that butter. \"Listen, my good friends! Last night while you were sound asleep, the Metsola family's dog invited me to a party and I agreed to go, so may I be excused to go to the farm today?\" Bear and Wolf thought this very bad timing when they were urgently clearing the field, but they gave Fox permission to go to the party. Gleefully, Fox trotted to the rock where the tub of butter was hidden, opened it up, and began to eat. When he had eaten his fill, he closed the lid and hid the tub back under the rock. Then he sprawled in the sun for a good long time until evening came, when he returned to the bear and the wolf. \"Was the party fun?\" asked Wolf. \"Oh, yes,\" said Fox. \"And the food was delicious and buttery.\" They slept another night, and in the morning Fox told them that the Ilmola family's dog had visited during the night to invite him to another party. \"This is very odd,\" Bear and Wolf puzzled. \"Why didn't they invite us, too?\" \"They don't want you wild, lumbering creatures spoiling their nice house,\" the fox said rudely. Despite his rudeness, and because he had received the invitation, he was permitted to go. So Fox skipped merrily off, straight to the tub of butter, and stuffed himself, just as he had the day before. \"Was the party fun?\" asked Wolf again, when Fox came back that evening. \"Oh, yes,\" he said, sneakily wiping grease from the corners of his mouth. \"I had a wonderful time!\" They slept another night and in circling, but Fox explained with his silver tongue that he was keeping careful watch to make sure no trees fell on his hard-working friends. Satisfied with the explanation, the bear and the wolf toiled on. Then Bear felled such a big tree that she could not carry it by herself, and she asked Fox to help her. \"Alright,\" Fox agreed. \"You take the top, there, and I'll push from behind.\" Bear did as Fox directed, but when she glanced back, she saw the idle trickster sitting on the tree, letting Bear pull him, too! This was too much. Bear gave a ferocious \"ROAR!\" and lunged for the fox, who leapt behind a tree and tried to cajole the angry beast from there. \"Come now, Bear,\" Fox wheedled. \"I was just having a tiny little rest. I'm so much smaller and weaker than you, after all. Won't you forgive me, dear friend?\" The bear didn't have time to argue with so much work waiting, and so she gave a frustrated growl and went back to her task. Eventually evening came and Fox, Bear and Wolf curled up to sleep. But Fox could not sleep, no matter how hard he tried; all he could think of was the tub of delicious butter sitting under the rock.An Illustrated Collection of Nordic Animal Tales is a treasure trove of amusing animal folk stories, beautifully illustrated by Pirkko-Liisa Surojegin . Why not share this tale of the sly and mischievious fox with your class?Bear, Wolf and Fox clear a field the morning Bear and Wolf heard once more that Fox had received an invitation, this time to a party at the J\u00e4rvinen family home. \"There certainly are a surprising number of parties going on around here, especially considering it's springtime and peak farming season,\" Bear said. \"But go ahead, since you seem to be so popular.\" So, once more, the greedy fox went back to the tub of butter and this time ate up all that was left. When he returned that evening, the bear and the wolf had finished clearing the whole field and lay sprawled in exhaustion, waiting for their friend. \"Fox, since you've been celebrating for three days and had more than enough to eat, Wolf and I are going to have the butter for breakfast tomorrow morning,\" Bear said, stifling a yawn. \"That's fine. You've earned it, clearing such a big field,\" Fox nobly agreed, and the three animals settled down to sleep once more. The next morning the animals set out to fetch the tub of butter from under the rock. But when they got there and opened up the tub, they discovered there was nothing left but a few tiny scrapings of butter! Bear and Wolf looked grimly at each other and then at Fox. \"You sneak! You've been here and eaten it all!\" the bear growled. The wolf bared his long yellow teeth as the two Pirkko-Liisa Surojegin is a well-known Finnish illustrator, renowned for her delicate, detailed portrayals of Finland's wildlife and folklore.

Then all three of them hurried quickly back into the forest. \"How will we share it?\" Wolf asked. Fox proposed they give the tub to whichever of the three could remember the most things. \"I, myself, remember things from long, long ago - indeed, I believe that I remember absolutely everything.\" This outraged the bear. She slammed the tub of butter onto the ground at her feet and roared, \"Shut your mouth! How can you remember things from long ago when you've only seen three summers?\" When Fox saw that Bear could not be duped so easily, he suggested that they store the tub of butter under a rock until they came up with a better solution. They all agreed, and at last they got to work. Bear and Wolf felled trees and uprooted stumps while Fox padded about claiming to be busy. Bear finally became irritated by the crafty creature's The bear, the wolf and the fox lived in the great pine forest beside Farmer Metsola's land. They spent their days hunting for food, but it was hard work and they often went hungry. They had watched Farmer Metsola at work many times and believed they knew everything there was to know about growing grain, and so one spring morning they decided to try farming for themselves. After all, how difficult could it be? The three animals looked for a place in the woods that would make a good field for their crops and set to work clearing it. But sly Fox was lazy and didn't feel like working. Instead, he plotted and schemed to find any way he could to get out of it. \"I think it would be wise to stock up on provisions, with such a tough job ahead of us,\" he said. \"I saw Mrs Metsola carrying a big tub of butter into the storehouse on the farm. Would you agree, dear friends, that we should go and fetch it for us all to eat later?\" \"We certainly agree,\" chorused Bear and Wolf. So they set off together to fetch the tub of butter. Bear stayed outside the farm's storehouse to keep watch while Wolf and Fox snuck in and snatched \"They decided to try farming for themselves.

The courtier solicited drawings for the Pope's consideration from the finest artists in Siena and Florence, including the Florentine artist Giotto. The commission for mural paintings in Rome was explained to Giotto and he was asked for a sample of his work. At this the artist took a sheet of paper and a brush dipped in red paint, pressed his arm against his side, and with a turn of his hand drew in one stroke a perfect circle. Then, with a smile, he said to the Pope's representative, \"There is your drawing.\" The courtier, expecting a more finished illustration exclaimed, \"Is this the only drawing I'm to have?\" Giotto warmly replied, \"It is more than enough. Send it along with the others and you'll see whether it is understood or not.\" The Pope's messenger, convinced he was being made a fool of returned to the Vatican with his collection of pictures. When Benedict IX was reviewing the art work his eye fell upon Giotto's drawing and it was explained how, without the use of a compass, the artist precisely drew the circle. The Pope, realizing that this was the sign of a master, awarded Giotto the commission to paint five scenes from the life of Christ in the apse of the old Saint Peter's in Rome. Giotto's circle is more than an entertaining story, for it points to the important connection between art and its mastery. Similar stories concerning the drawing of a circle as a sign of genius and perfect simplicity are attributed to Leonardo da Vinci and Albrecht D\u00fcrer, and these tales can lead us to ask the question: What is this visual language we call art and what is the spiritual significance of symbol and picture making? Filippo Brunelleschi, a well known contemporary of Giotto, said: \"The lines and forms are visible signs of divine gestures. Learn to understand them and you will comprehend how God created the universe.\" In the case of the circle, we can observe that it is Teaching Art History is an invaluable illustrated guide by Van James for Class 9. This extract recounts the story of Giotto's circle, linking in the wider significance of lines and forms.The potency of perfect form a unique form consisting of a single curved line bending uniformly with no angles to enclose a perfectly balanced space representing wholeness, oneness, indivisibility, nature, the Great Spirit, the Mother Goddess, the universe. It has been used as a symbol of the cosmos by indigenous peoples and as a ritual diagram to conjure the centre of the world, the axis mundi. Other forms such as the zigzag, the chevron, the cross, the lattice, and many others served various ritual purposes and prefigured the development of written languages. Such forms, originally thought to be idle doodles, are more abundant in Palaeolithic caves than are the figurative images of animals. Have students discuss the purposes for different symbols, research their various origins and meanings, and draw them. By making the hand actually render the forms, artistic feeling is stirred and can awaken one's thinking to greater awareness of the form's meaning. Van James is an international arts advocate and a guest tutor at numerous teacher training colleges and Steiner schools. He is editor of Pacifica Journal, and is an active artist, graphic designer, and author of numerous books on culture and the arts. Teaching Art History offers a comprehensive study of an art history teaching block in Class 9, covering a diverse range of work through the ages of history to create a lavlishly illustrated and engaging resource for teachers.
