With Easter around the corner, I wanted to create an easy recipe for a non-toxic playdough that I could put into their Easter Baskets! I think they will love all of the fun colors that I was able to create with some simple vegetables and spices that I had on hand. Natural Dye 1 1/2 c of water per color Vegetable or fruit: 1 cup Spice ingredients: 1 tbsp Baking Soda Homemade Playdough Recipe 1 cup flour 1 cup liquid (water or homemade vegetable dye shown below)- see details below 2 tsps cream of tartar 1/2 cup salt 1 tbsp olive or coconut oil Instructions for the Natural Dye Grab a few saucepans, and set them on the stove. Fill each pan with 1 1/2 cups of water. Next is the fun part! Add your favorite vegetables, fruits, or spices to the water! For veggies or fruit, add in 1 cup. For spices, add in a tbsp. Here are some ideas below for colors! The ones with asterisk are ones that I made for this blog post. - Blue*- cabbage (after it has cooled, add in a few tsps of baking soda to turn it blue!) - Purple*- blueberries and elderberries, you can also do just plain red cabbage - Tan/Light Yellow- Dandelions (do 1 cup) - Ecru*- Spinach Powder - Pale Pink- Paprika - Teal- Spirulina Powder - Brown- Coffee Beans (maybe about a 1/2c-cup) - Pink- Beets Turn the heat to high, let it start to boil, and then simmer on a lower heat for 20 minutes. After it is finished, strain each dye into separate mason jars and let cool. Instructions for Non-Toxic Playdough First, you will want to combine the flour, salt, and cream of tartar into a bowl. The next few steps depend on how many colors you want to make your non-toxic playdough! The combined dry mixture will be about 1 and a half cups. You will want to divide that number into however many colors you want to create. For me, I wanted four different colors, so that equaled about 1/3c of the flour mixture per batch. The flour mix and liquid are a 1:1 ratio, so you will use as much liquid as flour for each batch. If you are following what I did for this recipe, your first batch out of four, you will use 1/3c of the flour mixture and 1/3 cup of your natural dye that you created. Stir this over medium/low heat until it starts to form a clump. Transfer the playdough to a sheet of wax paper to cool, and start your next batch for a different color! Repeat this as many times as you have ingredients for (for me it was 4 times), and then let them cool. Add In Essential Oils Take each ball and gently knead with your hand for a few minutes. Now is the time to add in some essential oils if you want to!
