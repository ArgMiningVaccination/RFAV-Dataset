It is a blackish-brown powder or exudate obtained from high mountain rocks in the Himalayan mountains between India and Nepal. It is also found in Afghanistan, Tibet, Russia, and north Chile. In north India, it is known as shilajatu, salajit, mummiyo or mimie.2 Shilajit is an important drug listed in the Ayurvedic Materia medica and is extensively used by Ayurvedic physicians for managing a range of diseases. Shilajit is regarded to potentially carry the healing powers of great mountains. It is composed of rock minerals, rock humus, and organic substances that have been compressed by layers of rock.1 Shilajit is composed of humins, humic acid and fulvic acid. Fulvic acid is the major component that accounts for 60 to 80% of its nutraceutical components. Other components present in amino acids.2 Shilajit also contains more than 84 minerals, including silver, copper, zinc and iron.3 The properties of Shilajit are as follows: Did you know that shilajit is composed mainly of humic substances, particularly fulvic acid, which makes up approximately 60% to 80% of its total nutraceutical composition? This remarkable natural substance also contains various oligoelements, including selenium, known for their potential anti-aging properties. [Dr. Siddharth Gupta, Also & Side Effects](https://pharmeasy.in/blog/ashwagandha-uses-benefits-side-effects/) Anaemia is characterised by a decrease in the number of red blood cells or the standard quantity of haemoglobin in the blood. Iron deficiency anaemia is a common type of anaemia. Shilajit contains iron. When taken as a dietary supplement, it was observed that Shilajit increased the haemoglobin level in an animal study. Taking Shilajit as a dietary supplement might be beneficial in the management of iron deficiency anaemia.4 However, this information is insufficient as this study is conducted on animals. Therefore, a large-scale human study is required to suggest the potential uses of Shilajit to overcome the iron deficiency in humans. Shilajit supplementation might be beneficial in boosting exercise performance by enhancing fatigue-related metabolic characteristics and increasing muscle mass and strength. In a clinical study, supplementation with Shilajit had favourable effects on the retention of muscular strength after a exhausting task.5 However, further studies are required to suggest the benefits of Shilajit for muscle fatigue. Be careful when considering the consumption of shilajit! It's important to note that unprocessed shilajit may contain substances such as mycotoxins, heavy metals, polymeric quinones, and free radicals, which can pose potential health risks. [Dr. Rajeev Singh, BAMS] Various experimental studies have shown the beneficial effects of Shilajit on lipid profile. Shilajit showed prominent practical action against injuries to the heart muscles in an animal model. It lessened the harmful effects on heart tissue in rats.6 However, this study is done on animals and not humans. Therefore, more human trials are required to find the true scope of Shilajit in humans.

Shilajit may have protective effects on the stomach and duodenum, potentially reducing ulcer formation. [Dr. Smita barode, BAMS] The common problems associated with people who ascend to high altitudes from places of low altitudes are high altitude pulmonary oedema (fluid retention in lungs), acute mountain sickness, high altitude cerebral oedema (swelling of the brain), lack of appetite, hypoxia (lack of enough oxygen in the tissues), insomnia, lethargy, stomach upset, physical and mental depression. Shilajit contains fulvic acid. The fulvic acid may help stimulate energy production, blood formation and avert hypoxia. It may also help transport nutrients to tissues and helps overcome lethargy, tiredness, and chronic fatigue. Shilajit might be used as a supplement by people travelling to high altitudes.3 However, before using Shilajit while travelling, please consult it with your doctors and never use it to self-medicate yourself. A peptic ulcer is a gastric (stomach) lesion that is developed when the gastric lining is exposed to aggressive agents. Oxidative stress and free radical damage are factors responsible for gastrointestinal disorders. Shilajit may have anti-ulcer, anti-inflammatory, and antioxidant activity. Therefore, Shilajit might be a beneficial solution for stomach ulcers as a human gastroprotective (stomach protective) agent.7 However, this information is insufficient; therefore, further research on humans is necessary to develop the true extent of the potential uses of Shilajit in humans. Fulvic acid found in Shilajit may have memory-enhancing properties. Fulvic acid also helps the self-aggregation of tau protein into a filament (a factor involved in the development of Alzheimer's). Shilajit may also have the potential to be developed as a dietary supplement to reduce the symptoms of Alzheimer's disease.2 However, this data is insufficient and we require more human trials to suggest the benefits of Shilajit for brain health. Though there are studies that show the benefits of Shilajit in various health conditions, these are insufficient and there is a need for more studies to establish the true extent of the benefits of Shilajit on human health. Over the years, I have observed that the methanolic extract of Shilajit may have inhibitory activity against the fungus. Shilajit may have antifungal properties, potentially helping combat fungal infections. [Dr. Anuja Bodhare, MD] Your Ayurvedic physician will prescribe you the form and dose as per your requirement. In addition, we advise you not to replace or discontinue your ongoing medications with any ayurvedic or herbal preparations made from Shilajit without consulting a qualified physician. However, if you experience any side effects after having Shilajit, immediately rush to the hospital and get appropriate treatment to overcome your side effects. In my experience, Shilajit has been used in Ayurvedic medicine for diabetes. It has shown potential in reducing the hyperglycemic response and may have anti-diabetic properties. [Dr. Ashok Pal, BAMS] Avoid giving it to small children and older adults due to no information about its safety.

However, people should not assume that there are no interactions at all. Therefore, it is better to follow the advice of your Ayurvedic doctor. They will prescribe you the best way to have it.

Shilajit may also be used as a nutritional supplement.2 Shilajit powder may be taken with milk. Products containing Shilajit are also available in the market, for example, Shilajit capsules.3 However, consult an Ayurvedic doctor before using Shilajit; they will tell you the dosage and form per your health requirements. Shilajit may have several beneficial properties likeanti-inflammatory, antioxidant, memory enhancing, and anti-asthmatic and it might also boost heart and liver health.2,4 Thus, Shilajit may be a good Ayurvedic supplement for health. However, you should take advice from your doctors and only use it if recommended. As per the classical texts, an acceptable form of Shilajit should burn without smoke and puff upon being subjected to fire. Upon being added to water, it should not dissolve entirely but leave a trail as it disintegrates and travels from the surface of the water to the bottom of the container.8 It may be difficult to identify the original Shilajit; therefore, it is best to consult an Ayurvedic physician. They will tell you how to use it and which is the best Shilajit product for your health. It is composed of rock minerals, rock humus, and organic substances that have been compressed by layers of rock.1 Shilajit is composed of humins, humic acid and fulvic acid. Fulvic acid is the primary component that accounts for 60 to 80% of its nutraceutical components.2 Also Read: [Mehendi: Uses, Benefits, Effects & evaluation testosterone levels in healthy volunteers.
