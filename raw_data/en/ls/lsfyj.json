To choose the right supplement there are six factors to consider: 1. High quality ingredients, 2. Practitioner approved, 3. Research-based, 4. Effective packaging, shipped to you from manufacturer to doorstep 6. via air-controlled shipment and storage. There are two types of vitamin and mineral supplements in our clinics and online dispensary: Whole-Food and Functional Synthetics. Each type is designed for specific uses and goals. Whole-food Vitamins and Minerals Supplements (VAMS) The main advantage of food-based VAMS is they are derived from real foods (i.e. fruits and vegetables) making them safer and more efficient. They are safer because they are from foods we normally consume and more efficient because the body can absorb the bio-available nutrients. Studies demonstrate that vitamin and mineral absorption is 135%-260% more effective for whole food nutrients over the inorganic, synthetic and isolated forms. Vitamin C is an example where the compound is more active when flavonoids are present in the supplement; these are readily abundant in products made from oranges and other similar foods. Likewise, researchers at Northwestern University Cancer Center concluded that vitamin A is more effective in whole-food form due to the interaction between the carotenoids and secondary plant compounds. Functional Synthetic Vitamins & Minerals (VAMS) There are situations when a synthetic vitamin is better than the whole-food alternative. Individuals with food allergies and sensitivities, the need for pharmaceutical grade potencies, and the need for highly targets nutrients are just a few factors that might affect whether whole-food or functional synthetic supplements are best for you. IMI carries five main brands to meet our client's needs: Innate Response Formulas, Vital Nutrients and Designs for Health plus two clinical brands called Bioceuticals and BioClinic. Every professional product is free from gluten, wheat, dairy, corn, egg, peanut and soy.

Which vitamins and minerals do I need? Aside from whether you choose wholefood or functional synthetic vitamin and mineral supplements, there are many variations in the type and dosage that you might need. Whilst there are some generalisations, for example, most people could benefit from extra vitamin D. There are also specific, individualised needs depending upon diet, where you live, your age, stress levels, even genetics. For this reason, we advise that you consult with a naturopathic to determine your current health status and needs. Our naturopaths, can make a broad assessment and recommend certain diagnostic testing to get a clear health picture of actual levels of certain vitamins or minerals. "}
