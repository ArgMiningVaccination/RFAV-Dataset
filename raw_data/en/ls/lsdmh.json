As there are potential side effects, you may keep your schedule flexible to rest properly. Vaccines boost immunity without infecting the body. You may be worried that taking the COVID-19 vaccines can make you sick with COVID- 19. Nevertheless, these vaccines do not contain live viruses. So, they are safe for you. The immune system instructs the body to react in certain ways. Different kinds of vaccines work in different ways to provide a defence mechanism. It typically takes about two weeks post-vaccination for the body to produce T-lymphocytes and B-lymphocytes that will recall how to fight coronavirus in the future. The process of building immunity can cause normal symptoms, like having a fever. The vaccine stimulates blood flow which circulates immune cells. It increases the blood flow so more immune cells can circulate, and it raises your body temperature to kill the coronavirus. Since so much has been said about side effects post-vaccination, if one does not show any side effects, they may doubt whether the vaccine is working. Whether you have any side effects or not, you get more than 92 per cent protection from the jabs.

The reaction to the second dose will be stronger than the first, as your immune system is sent on an overdrive. Doctors believe that post-vaccination symptoms may last for a day or two. They can be resolved easily with a paracetamol tablet taken if needed. Avoid painkillers such as diclofenac. In case of shortness of breath or giddiness, visit the nearest emergency hospital. Avoid taking any painkillers prior to the COVID-19 vaccination. It may hinder your body's normal immune response to the vaccine. Make sure to stay seated at the clinic/hospital waiting room for 20 minutes post-administration to observe any immediate reactions. The hospital personnel will monitor you for at least 15-30 minutes after getting the COVID-19 vaccine. Suppose you develop any side effects that do not resolve or are bothersome; you can immediately contact the healthcare team. Once you receive your first dose, the government issues a vaccine certificate that provides details about your age, gender and vaccine details, such as the name of the vaccine and the date of administration. It would be best if you got the second dose of the same vaccine to get maximum benefits. So ensure to collect your vaccination certificate. Side effects are linked to age. The elderly may show lesser side effects than the younger persons, who may have a faster and stronger immune response to the vaccine. Every individual's immune system is peculiar. Some may have more symptoms post-vaccine; others none at all. The guaranteed long-term side effect is immunity. The likelihood of personal protection from the vaccine is remarkable.
