The incredibly important role of the lymphatic system is often overlooked in Western medicine. Your lymph system drains the wastes from your body and controls and regulates your immune system. It is pumped through muscular contractions, so if one is sedentary, the lymphatic system will eventually become sedentary and will create toxicity in lymph tissues all over the body, such as the breasts, skin, joints, and muscles.* Manjistha is an herb that supports the natural function of the lymphatic system allowing nutrition to feed the cells and wastes to be removed from the body in an optimal fashion. Manjistha calms aggravated pitta and breaks up congested kapha. Many pitta-aggravated imbalances in the body, especially those of the blood, may be supported by Manjistha's affinity for balancing pitta.* Suggested Use: Take 1-2 capsules 2 times per day after meals or as directed by your health care professional. Bottle Contains: 90 vegetarian capsules, 460 mg each Ingredients: Does not contain: Yeast, gluten, corn, soy, milk, fish, animal products, binders, fillers, preservatives or artificial coloring Kosher Certified: No animal derivatives The Science The lymphatic system is considered one of the seven body tissues and the first to become compromised under stress. There is a stark contrast between how little attention is given to the lymph in the west and how highly it is revered in Ayurveda. Ayurveda has emphasized the importance of the lymphatic system for thousands of years, and also discussed the importance of detoxifying it. There are many strategies to keep the lymph healthy, but in the West, as a result of processed foods, environmental toxins, comfort foods and a lack of movement, the lymph can easily become congested. Common Symptoms of Lymphatic Congestion - Rings get tight on fingers - Soreness and/or stiffness in the morning - Feeling tired - Bloating/Holding on to water - Mild rash or skin irritation - Weight gain and extra belly fat - Brain fog - Breast swelling or soreness with each cycle - Dry skin - Hypersensitivity - Mild headaches - Elevated histamine reaction to environmental irritants - Occasional constipation, diarrhea, and/or mucus in the stool Keep Your Body's Drains Clean The lymphatic system is like the drains in your house and the blood is like the faucets. If the drains are clogged in your sink or toilet, do you only clean out the faucets? I hope not! You would clean the drains. The biggest drain we have in the body is the lymphatic system, which can stay clogged for many years. Manjistha supports healthy immune function in the lymph and blood while also protecting against lead toxicity. (4) This forces us to adapt to an environment of toxins that stresses and weakens immunity and other important pathways of detoxification. Manjistha (Rubia cordifolia) has been shown to significantly support the body's response to radiation and is a natural chelator of metals in the body. Numerous studies suggest it supports a healthy inflammatory response and antioxidant activity. Both are major functions of the lymphatic system. (3) As we all age, it is the ability to detoxify well and eliminate waste efficiently that will determine longevity and optimal health. When the lymph system becomes congested and loses its ability to remove waste well, the body will start to speak to us and the signs of circulatory congestion ensue. The key is to learn to listen while the body is still whispering, and not wait until it starts screaming. Upping the Antioxidant Ante In one study, Manjistha was found to provide powerful liver support when the liver was exposed to higher and higher levels of toxic chemicals. One mechanism by which Manjistha was shown to do this was by boosting the production of glutathione levels. Glutathione is perhaps the body's most powerful antioxidant. (1) In two other studies, Manjistha was found to be a potent antioxidant and, in one, even out-performed some classic antioxidants such as EDTA and vitamin E. (1, 2) Remember, antioxidants generally work their magic within the lymphatic system. Manjistha was also shown to protect the good fats in the liver and lymph from lipid peroxidation, which is when good fats become bad fats within the body. (1) Digestive Support and Balanced Mood In a recent study of the primary ingredient of Manjistha, Rubia cordifolia, on alloxan-treated animals, the results showed significant support for several digestive and emotional functions of the body including: - Healthy blood sugar (5) - Stomach and small intestine reactions to acid stress (5) - Everyday memory and cognition (5) - Balanced stress hormone production while under duress (5) - Stable mood with increased brain gamma-amino-n-butyric (GABA) levels (5) General Disclaimer: [Warning: Keep out of reach of children.
