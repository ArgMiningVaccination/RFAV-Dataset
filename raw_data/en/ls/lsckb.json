New-Brunswick Public Health continues to recommend that all those aged 6 months and over stay up to date with their COVID-19 vaccination. This means completing your primary series and getting the most recent booster offered as circulating variants of the SARS-Cov-2 virus continues in Canada and in other parts of the world. Vaccines work with your immune system so your body will be ready to fight the virus if you are exposed. Vaccination is one of the most effective ways to protect our families, communities and ourselves against severe illness, hospitalization, Post COVID-19 Condition or death from COVID-19. Hybrid immunity means you have received both vaccination and infection, creating an extra layer of protection. But this protection goes away over time. That's why keeping up with your vaccinations is important. After your primary series, booster doses help \"boost\" your immune response and extend your protection against the SARS-Cov-2 virus. Unvaccinated people are at much higher risk. Anyone choosing to delay their COVID-19 vaccinations should carefully consider their individual risks. To learn more about the vaccines, review Public Health New-Brunswick's [COVID-19 Vaccine Information Sheet ](https://www2.gnb.ca/content/dam/gnb/Departments/h-s/pdf/en/CDC/HealthProfessionals/SARS-CoV-2-Vaccines-COVID-19.pdf).
