These are the treasures of Mother Earth, glittering gems, stones and rock crystals born from elemental energy. In one shimmer, they can capture the sun, moon, salt seas, soil and mountains and they can transmute all that healing power back to us. Healing crystals have a long history \u2014 they have adorned the breastplates of priests and warriors, been used in shamanic service, have been guiding lights for ancient tribes, and have been stashed in the pockets of princesses, sailors, and healers. Take a look at our [essential guide](https://tinyrituals.co//blogs/tiny-rituals/healing-crystal-guide-essential-gemstones) to healing gemstones and find a crystal that captures you. In the modern world, these potent stones hold so much power. As time ticks on they only grow more potent and can be a hugely valuable asset for helping us to reconnect to the natural world. They help us to channel our intentions, raise our vibrations, and can bring out all that dormant grace, beauty and magic you already have stashed inside. Remember, everything in life holds a vibration and if we can match our inner vibrations to the things we want in this world, we may be able to manifest them into our lives. How Crystals are Formed in the Earth Crystals go through an incredible geological process in the earth. The combination of heat, compression, and millions of years can do some incredible things! What Do Crystals Do? Sparkling stones, gorgeous gems, and heavenly crystals - for centuries, precious stones have been believed to help you heal. From Clear Quartz to Citrine and the soft lilac shades of Amethyst, there's no denying that crystals have mystical energy to them. Countless cultures have long believed that certain stones could be used to help with certain ailments. The ancient Sumerians would use crystals in their spells back in the 4th century BC. The Ancient Greeks and Romans would choose crystals that granted the courage to carry into battle. The Ancient Egyptians would also use healing stones as medicine. The list goes on. This lore has followed the shimmer of certain stones right up to the present day. Big vibrational energies, [chakra](https://tinyrituals.co/collections/chakra-crystal-bracelets) aligning powers, and powers that range from protection to self-reflection, the use of crystals has long hallmarked the art of wellness and deep work of healing. How Do Crystals Work? Crystals are said to have healing properties as they have high vibrational frequencies. Everything is energy and the belief is that the high vibrations of crystals affect and interact with the body's own energy field. The high vibrations of a crystal can turn the dial up on your own energy or it can get to work redirecting or channeling energies that can cleanse any blockages in the chakras and bring the body, mind, and soul into alignment. While the belief in the healing energy of crystals can be traced back thousands of years, Marcel Vogel - an American new age scientist helped reignite this knowledge in the 20th century thanks to his work on using quartz crystals for therapeutic purposes. After working for IBM for decades in research and development and creating the first liquid crystal displays for LCDs, he became interested in crystals, energy fields, and vibrations. His pioneering work helped the world to understand that crystals cut into different shapes could hold and exert the universal life energy. Even for those who are unsure of the scientific evidence behind healing crystals, using the earth's stones and precious gems to help the body, mind, and soul can be done in a more reflective manner or to trigger the placebo effect. The crystals you are drawn to, the [chakras](https://tinyrituals.co/collections/chakra-crystal-bracelets) you want cleansing, and the energy or healing you are seeking - crystals and their healing properties can act as a mirror even when it comes to placebo moods. They can work to illuminate parts of yourself, connect you with your desires, boost your well-being, and help you to manifest the life you want to live based on all that knowledge. What Are Crystals Used For? Thee are many different ways you can call on the healing vibes of crystals and there isn't a one size fits all approach when it comes to precious stones. Your journey is totally unique to you whether you want to turn to the power of crystals for chakra alignment, to manifest intentions, to help heal and harmonize the body, or to balance your emotions. Each crystal is utterly unique and brings its own healing properties - even the color of the crystal plays a part in its healing capabilities. Crystal shapes will also bring different powers and strengths and the method by which you use your crystals matters too. We take a look at some of the different ways in which people are called to use healing gemstones. Intention Certain crystals have certain strengths and by calling on the healing power of these crystals, you can use them to strengthen and manifest your intentions. Intentions are aims or goals that you want for your life. This could be anything from craving deeper connections to wanting more money and wealth or better mental health, it could be wanting to connect or forgive yourself - to grow your confidence. It could be wanting to get better focus to achieve a dream or it could be wanting to let go of old wounds and move into a new beginning. By choosing crystals that align with your intentions, you can call on the energy you need to shift and shape that reality. Chakra Realignment We have seven energy points across the body and these are known as chakras. These spinning disks of energy can get blocked and using the healing vibrations of crystals can help to shift these blocks and shake out stagnant energy. Different crystals are connected to different chakras and you can usually use the color of a stone as a good estimate of which chakra it is tied to energetically as chakras are also linked to certain colors. The seven chakras rise up from root to crown and are; the root chakra (red), the sacral chakra(orange), the solar plexus chakra (yellow), the [heart](https://tinyrituals.co/collections/crystal-hearts) chakra (green), the throat chakra (blue), and the third eye chakra (purple), and the crown chakra (purple). Physical Ailments Crystals can be used for healing the body, mind, and soul. When it comes to physical ailments certain crystals may be able to ease health issues. Because some health issues may be exasperated by energetic blockages in the body, the high vibrations of the crystals may be able to shake those out. Some healing gemstones also have highly soothing energy which can help ease the symptoms associated with stress and anxiety - many of these which can show up in the body and affect the immune system. Amethyst for example is a great stone for easing headaches and encouraging sleep. Citrine can raise your energy levels thanks to its positive energy. Bloodstone can help with healthy circulation and Aventurine can be used to speed up your recovery after an illness. Emotional and Psychological Support Another hugely popular reason that people choose crystals is that they can lend a lot of emotional and psychological support. Healing gemstones can put you in touch with blocked feelings and can soothe and temper frayed nerves. They can also balance big emotions and prevent you from feeling overwhelmed. Again, different crystals bring different skills when it comes to emotional balance and support. For example, Rose Quartz is a great gem for helping to improve your sense of self-care, healing old wounds, and opening you up to love. Clear Quartz can help bring clarity and understanding, Amethyst calms the mind, and Moonstone balances big hormonal energy. How to Choose Your Stone There is a whole world of different crystals and healing gemstones out there. It can seem daunting to know which stone you want to welcome into your world. One of the most important lessons that crystals teach us, is the reminder to tune in and listen to our own intuition and to trust that we have the knowledge we need. Our body, mind, and soul are all connected and we are made up of energy just like everything in the universe. If we can tap into that power, we can listen to the signs and messages that the world has to show us. Finding the right crystal means feeling into which ones you are drawn to (or which ones are drawn to you). Even just hearing a crystals name, seeing a picture, or reading a blurb - you may feel a tug deep down inside that is calling you to that exact stone. Each crystal also comes with its own healing properties. As we sometimes have awareness of our own strengths and weaknesses, we can choose healing crystals based on their specific traits to help guide us. Another method for choosing crystals could also be turning to the [zodiac](https://tinyrituals.co/collections/zodiac-bracelets). Certain crystals work with certain zodiac signs, so having this information can help link you to a set of stones that harmonize in accordance with the stars. Does the Shape of the Crystal Matter?

Once you have the crystals you want to work with, it helps to know a little about the best ways to use and care for them. Crystals get a kick out of connection and there are many ways to keep these gems activated and working in harmony with all your intentions. Find out how to use your crystals and how to care for them. Using Your Crystals Harnessing the power of your crystal can take little work, even just having them on your person can activate and attune them to your energy. You can also use them in more targeted and specific ways. Here are a few ways in which you can use your stones. - Wearing crystal jewelry (necklaces, bracelets, etc) is one of the simplest and most effective ways of calling on the power of your crystals. When they have direct contact with the skin, they can help raise your vibrations. - Carrying crystals on your person (in your pocket or purse) also carries your intention - You can place protective and healing stones in your home or workspace to fill the space with that energy. - Hold your crystals during meditation or place them on your yoga mat or altar during spiritual practices. - You can build crystal grids for manifestation and protection Cleansing and Recharging Keeping your crystal cleansed and charged is all part of crystal connection and ownership. Crystals do big energy work and as they spend time soaking up negative energy, they work better when they have been discharged and recharged from time to time. Again, you can call on your intuition to work out the best time for this but it's recommended to definitely do it after a big energy session. Here are some methods for cleansing and charging crystals, although not all methods are suitable for all crystals as some are more delicate than others... - Hold them under running water for a quick discharge - Place them under the light of a full moon and leave them overnight - Let them sit in the sun for a few short hours [Smudge](https://tinyrituals.co/collections/sage-smudging)them with your favorite incense or [sage](https://tinyrituals.co/collections/sage-smudging) - Place them in the company of cleansing gems like Quartz and Selenite Crystals are incredible and come with many properties that can bring love, light, and healing to your life. By understanding the basics, calling on your own intuition, and showing a little TLC to these stones, you can elevate your own powers and sense of connection in this world. A Final Thought Whether single stone or wrist rattling with [gemstone bracelets](https://tinyrituals.co/collections/gemstone-bracelet-sets), bringing healing crystals into your life can be hugely rewarding. We all have work to do and we can all benefit from balancing out the emotional, spiritual and physical sides of our being so we can step out of the shadows and into the light of our most authentic selves.
