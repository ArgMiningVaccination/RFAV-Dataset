Full Story Children's Health Defense \u2014 Robert F. Kennedy Jr.'s organization with a [history of spreading vaccine disinformation](https://www.factcheck.org/search/#gsc.tab=0&gsc.q=children's%20health%20defense&gsc.sort=) \u2014 has released a [video](https://perma.cc/737B-VA2J) rehashing an old claim that casts doubt on tetanus vaccines. [Tetanus](https://perma.cc/ZV43-Z5YX) affects the nervous system after bacteria called Clostridium tetani enter the body through an open wound. More than 80% of cases occur in mothers and their babies, [according to UNICEF](https://perma.cc/DYH4-9GVW). The fatality rate for infants is between 80% and 100%, [according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention](https://perma.cc/H84F-FP7D). Both organizations noted that lack of access to hygienic delivery and umbilical cord care contributes to high rates of infection, which is concentrated in South Asia and sub-Saharan Africa. The World Health Organization and UNICEF have undertaken [several](https://perma.cc/G7FR-ML8B) [vaccination](https://www.unicef.org/media/89221/file/SOWC%202014.pdf) [programs](https://cdn.who.int/media/docs/default-source/mca-documents/advisory-groups/quality-of-care/every-new-born-action-plan-(enap).pdf?sfvrsn=4d7b389_2) to address maternal tetanus. For example, UNICEF partnered with [Kiwanis International](https://perma.cc/S63R-DREQ) in 2010 in a [vaccination effort](https://www.unicefusa.org/stories/huge-milestone-moms-and-babies/31670) that resulted in more than a 40% decrease in the number of newborns dying of the disease between 2010 and 2015. Although there are [safe and effective vaccines](https://www.chop.edu/centers-programs/vaccine-education-center/vaccine-details/diphtheria-tetanus-and-pertussis-vaccines) to prevent tetanus \u2014 which are often paired with immunization for diphtheria and pertussis, also called whooping cough \u2014 their use has been falling, [as have vaccination rates](https://perma.cc/WC5Z-VBU3), generally, since the COVID-19 pandemic began. Despite the danger of this disease for infants, Children's Health Defense has made a video \u2014 and promoted it on [social media](https://perma.cc/B44N-JRR2) \u2014 suggesting that some tetanus vaccines are actually part of a covert plot to control population growth by rendering women of childbearing age infertile. But the evidence they present is just a reprise of rumors that have been around since the 1990s. Basically, the theory is that a hormone blocker that would cause infertility had been surreptitiously added to tetanus vaccines. This claim, like many long-standing conspiracy theories, is based on a grain of truth. Researchers had developed a combination contraceptive and tetanus vaccine that was tested in the early 1990s and was designed to prevent pregnancies temporarily (it did not have a permanent effect on fertility). But hormone blockers have [never been used in tetanus vaccines](https://cdn.factcheck.org/UploadedFiles/WER9206.pdf) available to the public; they've only been used in research. The vaccine and contraceptive combination was developed by [Dr. Gursaran Prasad Talwar](https://perma.cc/W24X-F5XX), who founded India's National Institute of Immunology and served as its first director, and was [tested on 148 volunteers](https://perma.cc/8X69-ZRB8) in 1992 and 1993. That study found that a birth control vaccine was feasible, but the tested formula wasn't effective enough. Only about 80% of women in the trial produced enough antibodies to prevent pregnancy. \"Efficacy above 90% is required and desirable,\" Talwar explained in an [interview with Nature India](https://perma.cc/7VNZ-WT4W) in 2010 when he was asked about that trial. \"Thus, immunogenicity of the vaccine had to be improved to make it practicable for fertility control. All the while we had to contend with ill-informed criticism from interested lobbies that the birth control vaccine will sterilize women forever.\" Development of the vaccine was put into \"low gear\" after he retired from NII, Talwar said. But research on a birth control vaccine revived in 2006, although \u2014 importantly for Children's Health Defense's claim \u2014 tetanus had been replaced with E. coli as the vehicle paired with the hormone blocker, so the most recent research didn't even use tetanus. Talwar had [initially chosen](https://cdn.factcheck.org/UploadedFiles/SAJuly1996.pdf) to use tetanus when he began his research because the disease so heavily affects women in childbirth, and he attributes his own mother's death \u2014 eight days after he was born \u2014 to tetanus. Regardless, neither his original formulation nor the more recent formulation with E. coli has been produced or distributed for general use. But, as we said, the claim that a hormone blocker was added to tetanus vaccines to cause infertility and control population growth has been [circulating for decades](https://web.archive.org/web/20050205141326/http://www.who.int/archives/inf-pr-1995/pr95-56.html) and has been [thoroughly](https://www.forbes.com/sites/tarahaelle/2014/11/17/a-resurrected-vaccine-fear-puts-kenyan-infants-at-risk/?sh=2c622d8e2759) [debunked](https://africacheck.org/fact-checks/blog/analysis-why-does-old-false-claim-about-tetanus-vaccine-safety-refuse-die). In fact, the Children's Health Defense video features the same people who made the claim in Kenya in 2014. One of the most prominent was Dr. Stephen Karanja, who [died of COVID-19](https://perma.cc/YFZ6-VRSM) in April 2021, about two months after calling COVID-19 vaccines \"totally unnecessary.\" Karanja had discouraged the use of many vaccines through his organization, the Kenya Catholic Doctors Association. So, Children's Health Defense is peddling a long-debunked claim about a life-saving vaccine in a time when [vaccination rates](https://perma.cc/2XMZ-2FJP) have plateaued and, in some cases, declined.
