[1](#footnote1_63gmzzu) Because of (a) the strong evidence that expanding access to vaccinations for children in the developing world is [an effective way to save lives](https://www.givewell.org/international/technical/programs/immunization), and (b) the potential for it to do so cost effectively, we sought to answer the question: what giving opportunities would increase immunization coverage globally? In order to answer this question, we spoke with the organizations working on this program. This page details our impressions from these conversations; most statements are supported by quotes from the conversations and not by detailed analysis. Current conclusions: We have not yet found promising funding opportunities to directly support the expansion of routine immunization activities. Published: November 2012 Organizations work on three different types of vaccination programs: - Routine vaccine delivery systems. Vaccinations delivered primarily through health facilities to children at ages that are specific to each vaccine. These vaccines include measles, polio, and DTP (diphtheria, tetatnus, and pertussis), among others. ( [More](#Routinevaccinedeliverysystems)) - Vaccination campaigns provide additional opportunities for children to receive a few key vaccines, as a way to reach children missed by the routine vaccination system and to provide additional doses to increase immunity to the targeted diseases. Campaigns are periodic events in which all people in a specified demographic in an area are vaccinated in a short time period. Vaccination campaigns are also called Supplementary Immunization Activities (SIAs). ( [More](#Vaccinationcampaigns)) - Eradication initiatives seek to eradicate single diseases. The Global Polio Eradication Initiative seeks to eradicate polio. ( [More](#Eradicationinitiatives)) Routine vaccine delivery systems - Developing country governments are generally responsible for paying for and delivering a set of inexpensive \"traditional\" vaccines through governments' existing health systems. Though governments are expected to pay for the vaccines, they are purchased through UNICEF's procurement service. [2](#footnote2_u12aurx)Governments can pay for \"traditional\" vaccines because they are inexpensive. [3](#footnote3_o5g0ttb) - UNICEF ( [www.unicef.org](http://www.unicef.org)) provides technical assistance to governments for their vaccine delivery programs and runs support programs such as social mobilization initiatives, implementation support, and vaccine market shaping; it is considering expanding its work in these areas. [4](#footnote4_9f8lpmo) In May 2012, UNICEF told us that it was seeking to focus on reaching the approximately 20% of children in the developing world who do not receive routine immunizations. UNICEF told us that specific activities will need to be tailored to the country's needs, and it is working with countries on plans and implementation to strengthen immunization. A representative stated that \"Funding is mainly needed in areas such as improving outreach, upgrading and modernizing the cold chain and the supply system, and social mobilization. While in most instances governments pay for the 'traditional' vaccines (BCG, Polio, DTP, Measles), most of the funding for new vaccines (Hepatitis B, Haemophilus Influenzae B, pneumococcal, rotavirus etc) in the poorer countries is provided by the international community through the GAVI Alliance, with recipient governments paying a small part.\" [5](#footnote5_sc5jrjy) UNICEF is a large diverse organization and we have not investigated how it funds its immunization work or how it prioritizes among its many different activities. - GAVI Alliance ( [www.gavialliance.org](http://www.gavialliance.org)) was created in the year 2000 to expand access to new and underused vaccines in the developing world. These vaccines are often much more expensive than the traditional vaccines that have been on the market longer, [6](#footnote6_gornkq7)and include vaccines that help to prevent diseases such as hepatitis B, meningitis, pneumonia, and diarrhea, which are responsible for a significant number of child deaths. [7](#footnote7_brxt1bx)In addition to providing financing for vaccines, which represents the bulk of its support to countries, [8](#footnote8_5ch1lhc)GAVI provides cash support to governments to strengthen the health systems that are responsible for delivering vaccines. [9](#footnote9_tcmk6ya) GAVI has also provided some support for traditional vaccines, including supporting immunization campaigns and outbreak response for measles (see below), providing one-time grants to the Global Polio Eradication Initiative and the Maternal and Neonatal Tetanus Elimination Initiative, and purchasing pentavalent vaccines, which include the DTP vaccine, a traditional vaccine. [10](#footnote10_mqlbcfp) Though GAVI primarily funds vaccines that are delivered through routine vaccination systems, it has also supported vaccination campaigns for meningitis A, [11](#footnote11_zds00j6)yellow fever, [12](#footnote12_hlom1dt)and, as noted above, measles, maternal and neonatal tetanus, and polio. In the future, it plans to support combined measles and rubella vaccination campaigns. [13](#footnote13_p3pic5n) In June 2011, donors pledged $4.3 billion to GAVI for 2011-2015, exceeding GAVI's fundraising target of $3.7 billion. [14](#footnote14_1bheac0)As a result of this successful fundraising effort, GAVI told us that additional funding would be used if pledges are not paid and to begin filling the funding gap for 2016 and beyond. [15](#footnote15_eun5k65) GAVI receives 76% of its funding from governments (largest donors include U.K., Norway, U.S., France, and Italy), and another 18% from the Gates Foundation. [16](#footnote16_oxm6oeb)GAVI expects to have $7.6 billion available for the period 2011-2015 or an average of $1.5 billion per year. [17](#footnote17_srz3dlm) (We previously considered GAVI: [2009 review of GAVI](https://www.givewell.org/international/charities/GAVI).) - World Health Organization ( [www.who.int](http://www.who.int)) describes its role in vaccination as \"activities including standard-setting, research and development, vaccine regulation and quality, vaccine supply and immunization financing, and immunization system strengthening.\" [18](#footnote18_1hx7szd) According to WHO's website, as of January 2012, it had a funding gap of $224 million for its immunization work in 2012-2013, including $86 million for \"measles control and surveillance\" and $31 million for \"meningitis control and surveillance.\" [19](#footnote19_tlssl92) We have contacted WHO for more information but have not produced publicly available information from this investigation. - Doctors Without Borders (Medecins Sans Frontieres, or MSF): MSF's work on vaccination was mentioned to us by multiple people we spoke to as part of this investigation. We spoke to MSF about its work in this area. MSF told us: - It would like to have vaccination teams who actively screen all children who visit its health centers and provide vaccinations to those who have not received them. It does not currently have sufficient funding or staff to provide vaccination screening to every child who visits. [20](#footnote20_ns0i6f8) - Its work also includes outbreak response, preventative vaccination campaigns, advocacy and policy, and operational research. MSF has been part of the introduction of the meningitis A vaccine and is a member of the Measles and Rubella Initiative. [21](#footnote21_p3xibkm) - MSF largely sets its priorities within the organization, rather than being driven by donors' preferences. We asked MSF, \"If we direct funding to MSF and request that the funding be used for vaccination, how will MSF's programs change (if at all)?\" MSF replied that it \"can and will accept restricted funds for vaccinations, but a restricted gift for this project may not mean that we do 'more.'\" [22](#footnote22_rqk2470) - It would like to have vaccination teams who actively screen all children who visit its health centers and provide vaccinations to those who have not received them. It does not currently have sufficient funding or staff to provide vaccination screening to every child who visits. Vaccination campaigns - Measles and Rubella Initiative ( [www.measlesinitiative.org](http://www.measlesinitiative.org)), formerly the Measles Initiative, funds national vaccination campaigns in which all children in a specified age range in an area are vaccinated for measles, and more recently, with a combined measles and rubella vaccine, regardless of whether they have received one or more doses of the vaccine previously. [23](#footnote23_qncgeit)In June 2012, GAVI announced that it would provide additional funding for measles campaigns and measles outbreak response. [24](#footnote24_qbk12nn)The funding from GAVI fills the Measles and Rubella Initiative's expected funding gap for measles campaigns and outbreak response for 2013-2015. [25](#footnote25_meegytu)The Measles and Rubella Initiative notes that funding gaps may exist in the future for (a) including older children in campaigns in countries where disease surveillance data shows that there are gaps in vaccination coverage for this age group; and (b) investing in disease surveillance to work toward measles eradication. The Measles and Rubella Initiative expects to have information on 2013 funding gaps for (a) after September 2012. [26](#footnote26_0gmodiq) In 2012, the Measles and Rubella Initiative expects to receive about 60% of its funding from developed country governments (excluding the CDC, a U.S. government agency) and 40% from the five partners that run the initiative (UNICEF, WHO, American Red Cross, CDC, and the United Nations Foundation) as well as from other contributors, such as Lions Clubs International. [27](#footnote27_wxjh7az)Its budget for 2012 is $234 million. [28](#footnote28_m71opzx) In addition to the funding for measles campaigns and outbreak response discussed above, GAVI has pledged support to the Measles and Rubella Initiative for combined measles and rubella vaccination campaigns in countries that have not yet introduced rubella vaccination. [29](#footnote29_zut83x4)The Measles and Rubella Initiative estimates that this support will total $335 million in 2013-2015. In 2013 to 2015, the Measles and Rubella Initiative's anticipates that more than half of the funding for its work will come from GAVI. [30](#footnote30_21tujlt)GAVI has not committed to fund measles vaccination campaigns once initial combined measles and rubella campaigns have been completed. [31](#footnote31_ccazyzq) - Maternal and Neonatal Tetanus Elimination Initiative ( [www.unicef.org/health/index_43509.html](http://www.unicef.org/health/index_43509.html)) is a partnership between UNICEF, WHO, and the United Nations Population Fund (UNFPA). [32](#footnote32_adunx6g)Vaccination campaigns target women of childbearing ages in high-risk areas with the aim of preventing tetanus in mothers and future newborns. Each campaign consists of three rounds of vaccination with tetanus-containing vaccines. [33](#footnote33_gk8a1a7) UNICEF leads the MNT elimination effort at the global level, while national governments are the main implementers of the campaigns. UNICEF provides funding, vaccine procurement, technical support, assistance with planning, and monitoring/supervision of the program. [34](#footnote34_d41zyn0)In the past ten years UNICEF has raised $200 million for MNT elimination; it is seeking to raise another $100 million by mid-2014. Potential funders include Kiwanis International, Proctor and Gamble, GAVI, U.S. Fund for UNICEF, and the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation. [35](#footnote35_w46ktxc) - Introduction of meningitis A vaccine: GAVI has pledged $370.4 million to introduce a new meningitis A vaccine in 25 countries in 2011-2015. [36](#footnote36_s8jzjd1)It expects the remaining $571 million needed for the program to be funded by implementing governments. [37](#footnote37_6qlkxrr) In the first stage, the program will conduct vaccination campaigns targeting 1 to 29 year olds with one dose of vaccine. After the initial campaigns are completed, the program will transition to delivery of the vaccine through routine immunization services and/or follow up campaigns targeting children age 1 to 4. [38](#footnote38_pd5qjk4) The website of the Meningitis Vaccine Project ( [www.meningvax.org](http://www.meningvax.org)), which developed the vaccine, notes, \"Groups or individuals interested in helping meet the funding gap for large-scale introduction of the meningococcal A vaccine in sub-Saharan Africa can contact [info@meningvax.org](mailto:info@meningvax.org)for additional information.\" [39](#footnote39_ewm1wd2)We have done some investigation into this funding gap but have not produced publicly available information from this investigation. Eradication initiatives We include information about the Global Polio Eradication Initiative (GPEI) for the sake of completeness but do not currently plan to pursue it. While eradicating polio may be a cost-effective use of funds, we feel that the polio eradication effort has reached a stage where the focus is on eradicating the relatively few cases remaining, [40](#footnote40_zf16yp1) an endeavor that is likely distinct from other immunization campaigns in terms of its high upfront costs and potential long-term benefits. While we have high confidence in the impact of protecting individuals from contracting diseases by providing them with vaccinations, we have not fully investigated the expected benefits and risks of eradicating a small number of remaining cases of one disease. We would guess that, unlike vaccinating individuals for common diseases, an eradication campaign is likely to have high potential impact and high risk of failure. In addition, with eradication, the size of the donation may be important, because conducting the effort at less than full scale could result in failure to accomplish the goal of eradication and thus loss of future gains. We have not contacted GPEI to discuss what the effect additional funding would have on its activities. Reported funding needs In its 2011 annual report, GPEI notes that it has a pressing need for additional funds for 2012-2013. [41](#footnote41_khigkza) GPEI has published details of its 2012-2013 budget and funding commitments and prospects. As of May 2012, it reported a funding gap for this period of $956 million. [42](#footnote42_pkohwf9) We believe that GPEI likely has strong prospects for raising the funds it needs because polio eradication is a major focus of the Gates Foundation, which has spent over $1.5 billion on the effort, [43](#footnote43_ixacmz8) and because polio eradication is one of Bill Gates' \"top personal priorities.\" [44](#footnote44_oyi3r1z) Current sources of funding In 2011, GPEI raised $1.1 billion for a budget of $0.98 billion; it started the year with a $0.36 billion funding gap. [45](#footnote45_44mr2c5) About 30% of funding in 2011 came from the Gates Foundation, 30% from developed country governments, 27% from countries at risk of polio, and the remainder from other foundations, non-profits, and other private funders.

In the World Health Organization's African and South East Asian regions, the figure was 77%. UNICEF, \"Immunization Summary (Data through 2010),\" Pg xiii. [2](#footnoteref2_u12aurx) \"Routine immunization with traditional vaccines is largely paid for by national governments, including both purchasing vaccines and running the cold chain and logistics. With support from partners, it still largely functions in the way it was set up in the 1980s. The traditional vaccines are procured through UNICEF (which purchases more than half of all vaccines doses globally, allowing it to negotiate lower prices), or directly by governments, and delivered by government health staff.\" Jos Vandelaer, phone conversation with GiveWell, May 25, 2012. [3](#footnoteref3_o5g0ttb) \"These vaccines are inexpensive; they cost about $0.10 to $0.25 per dose.\" Jos Vandelaer, phone conversation with GiveWell, May 25, 2012. [4](#footnoteref4_9f8lpmo) According to Jos Vandelaer, UNICEF believes that a larger effort is needed to raise immunizations rates further and is beginning to explore with countries how it can help them reach the hard-to-reach. It sees three main areas in which it could contribute going forward: - Support logistics: Setting up systems to improve supply management (reduce stock outs) and track spoilage of vaccines. UNICEF has traditionally worked on this in-country. - Social mobilization: UNICEF works to encourage people to access vaccines currently, but Dr. Vandelaer thinks that more is needed. - Better data on the unimmunized: In-depth analysis to determine why pockets of children aren't being vaccinated in order to inform program planning so that unvaccinated children can specifically be targeted. It could also contribute by: - Market shaping: Obtaining vaccines at reduced prices while ensuring a stable and healthy market. - Advocacy: Convincing governments to devote more resources to vaccination. UNICEF has historically been involved in the areas above, but now thinks that it needs to focus more directly on scaling up its efforts and fundraising to focus on the above. Jos Vandelaer, phone conversation with GiveWell, May 25, 2012. [5](#footnoteref5_sc5jrjy) \"The approximately 20% of children who are not vaccinated tend to also lack access to other services and are therefore more likely to get diseases (e.g., due to poor nutrition or lack of water and sanitation) and more likely to die if they get sick (due to lack of access to healthcare). Funding is mainly needed in areas such as improving outreach, upgrading and modernizing the cold chain and the supply system, and social mobilization. While in most instances governments pay for the 'traditional' vaccines (BCG, Polio, DTP, Measles), most of the funding for new vaccines (Hepatitis B, Haemophilus Influenzae B, pneumococcal, rotavirus etc) in the poorer countries is provided by the international community through the GAVI Alliance, with recipient governments paying a small part... UNICEF has historically been involved in the areas above [see previous footnote], but now thinks that it needs to focus more directly on scaling up its efforts and fundraising to focus on the above. Initially, UNICEF will focus this 'scale up' in 13 priority countries, where many of the unimmunized children live, including Uganda, Chad, and DRC. Once plans are finalized, there will be a process to determine if the government or existing funders can fund the additional activities. If there is still a gap, which is likely, additional funders will be sought.\" Jos Vandelaer, phone conversation with GiveWell, May 25, 2012. [6](#footnoteref6_gornkq7) For example, the DTP vaccine cost between $0.14 and $0.42 per dose in 2011, while the \"pentavalent\" vaccine, which contains DTP plus Hepatitis B and Hib vaccines, cost between $1.75 and $3.20 per dose in 2011.

A decision by the Board to fund additional measles activities will offset much but may not offset all of the MR Initiative's shortfall.
