Luckily, a full body detox can significantly improve your health by getting those harmful toxins out of your system. When you hear the word detox, most likely you think about a smoothie cleanse or some kind of exercise. But these are just a few of the many ways of detoxing your body. Other kinds of treatments can also help you to eliminate the toxins in your body. For example, you can support detoxification with chiropractic care. What is a Detox? The air we breathe, the food we consume, and other particles we come in contact with daily can expose us to harmful chemicals. Our bodies' natural detoxing process helps us to manage these exposures and stay healthy. However, if our bodies are exposed to too many toxins, we can have a wide range of symptoms due to the high level of toxicity. Although the most common symptoms are fatigue, sleepiness, and concentration problems, in more severe cases, toxicity can also lead to chronic diseases or even death. How to Do a Detox Nowadays, our exposure to synthetic chemicals is much higher than it was a few years before. Therefore, it is important to reduce the body's toxin exposure. Luckily, our bodies have a natural detoxing process in which many of our organs participate, such as the kidneys, liver, blood, digestive system, and lymph nodes. You can also support this process to keep your body in balance and improve your health. Here are the most common ways to do a detox: - Drink more water - Exercise regularly - Make sure you get adequate and good quality sleep each night - Reduce stress - Consume more fresh and nutrient-dense whole foods, and reduce the consumption of processed foods - Fast (consider doing intermittent fasting, or if you would like to do it for a longer period, you can consult a professional) - Take cleansing supplements - Reduce your exposure to chemicals by paying attention to your hygiene and the cleaning products you use The Benefits of Chiropractic Care In case of toxin overload, some of the toxins will start to be stored in certain areas of your body, such as in your joints and visceral fat. Of course, this means that toxins can be built up even in the spine. If you have an underlying spine misalignment (which is common), the toxin buildup can be more aggravated because of its effect on the local nerve energy flow. With the help of [Virginia Beach chiropractor](https://mychirosolutions.com/), you can not only restore the spine alignment but also open and support the pathways of natural detox. Moreover, it is a great way to prevent the toxins from being unnecessarily stored and built up in your body.
