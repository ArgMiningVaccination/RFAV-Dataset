Hardin -Simmons, a doctoral (comprehensive university level V) with colleges of liberal arts and business, schools of education, music, nursing, science, and theology, a seminary, and a graduate school, is fully accredited and holds membership in good standing in the appropriate agencies as listed in this catalog. Graduates have been singular ly successful in being admitted to graduate and professional schools and have been readily employed in business, education, and professional fields. Located in Abilene, Texas, Hardin- Simmons has contributed to the development of the West and helped establi sh a city and area where cultural, educational, and spiritual values are highly regarded. Two other church- related universities in the city share with Hardin -Simmons an interchange of courses, library facilities, and extracurricular activities. A city civic center, symphony orchestra, three museums, community theatre groups, a county coliseum, and progressive leadership afford an active cultural environment in a metropolitan population of 125,000. Founded in 1891 as Abilene Baptist College, renamed Simmons College in honor of the first major donor, Dr. James B. Simmons, a Baptist minister of New York City, and later named Hardin- Simmons University in recognition of gifts by Mr. and Mrs. John G. Hardin of Burkburnett, Texas, the university has become well established with a growing endowment and modern facilities. The compact and beautiful campus is known as the Forty Acres. The Rupert and Pauline Richardson Library, the Frost Center for the Visual Arts, the Logsdon School of Theology Building and Chapel, t he Johnson Building for the Kelley College of Business, the Connally Missions Center, the Lee Hemphill Music Building, the Elwin L. Skiles Social Sciences Building, the Holland Health Sciences Academy Building and the Physician Assistant Program Building are among the latest additions to the campus. Originally founded by the Sweetwater Baptist Association, the university has been affiliated with the Baptist General Convention of Texas since 1941. Throughout its history, Hardin- Simmons University has emphas ized religious training and spiritual values; hundreds of preachers, missionaries, and directors of religious education and music are among the alumni. The foundation agreement reads in part that the school's purpose shall be \"To bring young men and women to Christ; to teach them of Christ; to train them for Christ.\" GRADUATE STUDIES Graduate study at Hardin -Simmons University was established in 1926 by action of the Board of Trustees. Graduate programs leading to the degrees of Master of Arts, Master of Business Administration, Master of Business Administration in Entrepreneurship, Master of Divinity, Master of Education, Doctor (Ed.D.) of Leadership, Master of Music, Master of Physician Assistant Studies, Doctor of Physical Therapy, Master of Science, and Master of Science in Nursing are available. The policies of the Graduate School are developed by the graduate faculty and administered by the dean of graduate studies. Students in graduate programs at Hardin -Simmons University will: 1. Increase knowledge and competency in a field of specialization. 2. Develop a spirit of inquiry and the capacity for original and independent thought. 9 3. Become proficient with techniques of research. 4. Grow intellectually, professionally, and culturally. Graduate study occurs at a l evel of complexity and specialization that extends the knowledge and intellectual maturity of the student. It requires students to analyze, explore, question, reconsider, and synthesize old and new knowledge and skills. The curriculum affords the depth of education, specialized skill, and sense of creative independence that will allow the graduate to practice in and contribute to a profession or field of scholarship. STATEMENT OF PURPOSE Hardin -Simmons University, a church- related institution affiliated with the Baptist General Convention of Texas: 1. Fosters the intellectual development of students by providing an academically challenging undergraduate education based upon a liberal arts foundation and advances scholarly growth by offering specialized gradu ate and professional degree programs. 2. Academic excellence continues as a priority at Hardin -Simmons University as it has for more than a century. The core curriculum involves students in a broad range of inquiry relating general studies with requirements of the chosen major. Graduate programs broaden the scope of learning in scientific and professional disciplines and encourage students to regard learning as a lifelong process. Small classes taught by experienced scholars give the opportunity for interacti ve learning. The institution's commitment to excellence is best illustrated through the lives of graduates who traditionally have excelled in a wide variety of fields. 3. Affirms the relevance and importance of the Christian faith for life in the contemporary world by maintaining a clear identification with and loyalty to the Christian faith and functioning within the context of historic Baptist values and principles. 4. Founded in 1891 by a determined group of ministers, ranchers, and merchants, Hardin- Simmons University established dual goals of developing the mind and nurturing the spiritual life of its students. That commitment to encourage growth in faith and knowledge has remained central. Believing academic excellence and Christian faith to be complementary, the university emphasizes the need for interaction between faith and reason. 5. Encourages individuals to lead lives of service through active involvement in intellectual, cultural, and religious life, both on the campus and in the larger communities of Abilene and the world. Although Western in tradition, the university takes pride in the cosmopolitan nature of its students, faculty, and staff, and encourages the development of an international perspective. Through its leadership in providing intellectual, spiritual, cultural, and social opportunities, the university serves as catalyst for the advancement and enrichm ent of its students and the community. (Approved, Board of Trustees, September 16, 1992) 10 FINANCIAL INFORMATION In order to provide students some security and predictability concerning the cost of education, Hardin -Simmons University guarantees that the tuition rate during the first tuition year (fo r example: the tuition year 2017 is June 1, 2017, through May 31, 2018 ) will not increase, as long as the student maintains full -time HSU enrollment during succeeding fall and spring semeste rs.

Additional information about these loans can be found at ht tp://www.hsutx.edu/offices/financial- aid/private -loans/. Financial Ai d Enrollment R equirements The number of hours in which students ar e enrolled have a di rect impact upon federal financial aid eligibility. In order to be eligible f or full-time financial aid, graduate students must be enrolled in nine or more hours during a long semester (see Ed.D., DMi n, Math, and KSPR for exceptions). Those enrolled for seven to eight hours will be considered half-time. Those enrolled in three credits of Thesis hours only will be considered half-time. According to federal regulations, students must be enrolled in at least six hours during a long term to receive federal financial aid. During the period which encompasses the short terms (May Term, Summer I, and Summer II), students must take a total of six hours to be eligible for financial assistance. Withdrawing from the university in consecutive long s emesters (fall, spring) will result in a r eview of sat isfactory progress toward a degree. According to federal and university guidelines, students not dem onstrating progress toward a degree are not eligible for financial aid. 17 University Financial Aid Policies Financial assistance is awarded for one year at a time. Separate financial aid applications (FAFSA) must be filed each year. Application ma terials are available in October for the coming academic year. Financial assistance is committed only to students who are accepted into a degree program. Students applying for graduate fellowships and or graduate scholarships must hold provisional or full admission to a graduate program. All institutional aid, including departmental awards, are HSU -tuition -specific. The university cooperates in making funds provided by both the federal and state government available to students for grants, employment, and loans. HSU must administer the federal and state programs within prescribed regulations. All government programs are dependent on funding by federal and state governments. Awards are subject to funding by legislation and are not binding on the university if such programs are not funded. All applications and requests for information regarding federal and state assistance should be directed to the Office of Enrollment Services , HSU Box 16050, Abilene, TX 79698. A student can only receive financial aid for repeat of the same course one time for a maximum of two attempts. To view HSU's Financial Aid policies, visit www.hsutx.edu/offices/financial -aid/policies Veterans Benefits The coordination of benefits for veterans is the responsibility of the Office of the Registrar, which offers assistance to veterans and dependents of veterans. In accordance with the laws regarding veterans in Chapters 30, 31, 34, and 1606 of Title 38 in the United States Code, assistance benefits to veterans and other eligible persons will be discontinued when the student ceases to make satisfactory progress toward the completion of his/her training objectives. Students placed on probation who receive VA benefits must show academic improvement every semester they continue on probation. ENDOWED SCHOLARSHIPS AND GRANTS Drs.

In addition, HSU requires every new incoming student under 22 years of age provide proof of the meningitis vaccine prior to registering for classes. (A returning student following a break in enrollment of at least one fall or spring semester is also considered a new student.) Exceptions to this law would be: 1. The student is enrolled only in online or other distance education courses; or 2. The student is enrolled in a continuing education course or program that is less than 360 contact hours, or continuing education corporate training; or 3. The student is enrolled in a dual credit course which is taught at a public or private K -12 facility not located on a higher education institution campus; or 4. The student is incarcerated in a Texas prison. A student is not required to submit evidence of receiving the Meningitis Vaccine if the student submits to HSU: 1. An affidavit or certificate signed by a physician who is duly registered and licensed to practice medicine in the U.S., stating that in the physician's opinion, the vaccine would be injurious to the health and well - being of the student; or 2. An affidavit signed by the student stating that the student declines the vaccine for reasons of conscience, including a religious belief. Students must use the official Texas Department of State Health Services (DSHS) form. It may be ordered electronically. The form is then mailed from DSHS to the student, and it may take up to two weeks to receive it. It must be completed, notarized and provided to Hardin- Simmons University Nurse's office. It is the student's responsibility to complete the DSHS form and have it notarized. The site to request the form is: https://corequest.dshs.texas.gov/ The latter exemption does not apply during a disaster or public health emergency, terrorist attack, hostile military or paramilitary action, or extraordinary law enforceme nt emergency declared by a Texas Department of State Health Services authority and is in effect for the location of the university the student attends. Texas law states that acceptable evidence of your Meningitis Vaccination must include: 1. Student's name an d date of birth. 2. Month, day, year the vaccine was administered. 3.

The University reserves the right to refuse or cancel a student's admission or to direct his/her activities in the University if the student's physical and/or mental health status indicates that such action is essential for safeguarding fellow students, faculty and staff. However, no student shall be denied admission, s uspended, or refused readmission by reason of race, age, physical or academic disability, color, sex, national origin, or religion. Full Admission Hardin -Simmons University admits to its graduate degree programs applicants who exhibit potential to succeed in an academically challenging graduate environment. Admission requires the endorsement of the program director and approval of the dean of graduate studies. Their decisions are based upon evaluation of the applicant's undergraduate transcript and additional criteria which may include standardized test scores (GRE, GMAT, and/or TOEFL), professional experience, personal and professional references, essays or writing samples, and interviews with the program director. Since the purposes and demands of the programs vary, each program establishes its own application requirements. These requirements are stated at the beginning of the degree program sections of this catalog. In the evaluation of applications, substantial weight is normally given to the unde rgraduate 25 academic record and, when required, standardized test scores. Each application, however, is evaluated individually and careful consideration is given to applicants who present other evidence of graduate potential. Applicants who have recently com pleted undergraduate work, for example, may expect that their academic record will serve as the principal indicator of graduate potential. Alternatively, applicants who have had time to establish a record of effective professional experience beyond their u ndergraduate experience may expect that to be given significant consideration as well. Provisional Admission Applicants whose materials are difficult to evaluate, lack the required materials, or necessary undergraduate prerequisites may be admitted provisi onally. Students granted provisional admission may earn full admission upon the completion of 12 hours of graduate study with a cumulative GPA of at least 3.0 and/or the completion of all undergraduate prerequisite work. Students who have been granted provisional admission for a graduate degree program must receive full admission in order to continue beyond 12 hours of graduate study, unless otherwise specified by individual program. International students are not eligible for provisional admission. Post Graduate This is a special status for students who neither apply to nor are admitted to any graduate degree or certificate program but wish to take a limited number of courses. In order to be granted postgraduate admission, the student must submit a transcript showing possession of an undergraduate degree from a regionally accredited institution of higher education. Students who wish to complete a second undergraduate degree should apply through Enrollment Services. Those who wish to begin or complete teacher certification should apply to the university through the Office of Admission; they will also apply for Teacher Certification and registe r for classes through the Irvin School of Education. All other postgraduate students should apply online and re gister in the Office of Admission . No student classified as postgraduate may take more than 12 graduate hours before receiving provisional or full admission unless enrolled in a certificate program. Postgraduate status does not imply admission to any graduate degree program and most are not eligible for financial aid. International students are not eligible for this status. Notification Official notification of admission or non- admission is communicated solely b y the Office of Admission . Appeals Students wi shing to appeal an admission decision should first consult with the program director. If the student is not satisfied, an appeal may be made to the dean of graduate studies, then to the Graduate Council, and finally to the provost. Orientation At the begin ning of the fall term, the Office of Graduate Studies conducts a student orientation for new graduate students. During this time, graduate school policies and procedures are explained and representatives from Graduate Studies, the Business Office, Information Management, and the Library introduce services available to graduate students and discuss important policies, procedures, and deadlines. All new graduate students are invited to attend. APPLICANTS WITH DISABILITIES Hardin -Simmons University complies with the Americans with Disabilities Act and Section 504 of the Rehabilitation Act of 1973 regarding students with disabilities. Eligible students seeking 26 accommodations should contact the coordinator as soon as possible in the academic term which they are seeking accommodations. The coordinator shall prepare letters to appropriate faculty members concerning specific, reasonable academic adjustments for the student. The student is responsible for delivering accommodation l etters and conferring with faculty members. The coordinator shall consult with the student and with HSU faculty and staff to ensure delivery of appropriate support services and shall serve as liaison between the student and the faculty member as needed. AUDITS A student applying for admission to audit a class must complete an application, submit the $50 application fee, a student health form and furnish a letter of permission from the instructor of the course. There is a $50 per semester -hour audit fee. Students over the age of 65 can audit courses at no charge. The audit application is processed in the Office of the Registrar. ACADEMIC POLICIES Grading System Grades in graduate courses indicate performance with respect to the quality of work at the graduate level. Please note that only graduate level courses are included in the graduate grade point average (GPA). Accordingly, students in graduate courses should be aware that grades are based upon more stringent criteria than those for undergraduate c ourses. Possible grades are: Grade* A Explanation Excellent Grade (Quality) Points 4 B Good 3 C Fair 2 D Poor 1 F Unacceptable 0 I Incomplete IP In Progress W Withdrew 0 WP Withdrew Passing 0 WF Withdrew Failing See Note CR Credit NC No Credit *A student who earns a grade of D, F, or WF will be placed on academic probation Grades of I and IP A student who has substantially completed a course but is lacking certain essentials of performance, due to circumstances beyond his/her control , may be given a grade of I. To obtain a grade in the course, the student must complete all requirements specified by the instructor by the end of the next long semester (fall or spring) following the date the grade was assigned. Failure to complete the requirements by this time will result in a grade of F. The grade of IP is available only when, by design, course work extends beyond the semester or term in which the course is scheduled. This grade implies satisfactory progress and is used primarily in internship, travel, and individual research courses. A grade of IP is not counted as an attempt in calculating grade point average and will convert to a grade of F after five years. Statute of Limitations on Changes in an Academic Record The statute of limitations for any change in an academic record is one year from the date of the 27 closing of the semester in question. Included are such items as grade changes and incompletes. Note: No student may graduate with an I or IP grade on his/her transcript. Any grade change must be reported to the Registrar's Office at least two weeks prior to the end of the semester of graduation. It is the responsibility of a candidate for graduation to complete any course in which an Incomplete or In Progress grade was given in s ufficient time for the faculty member to grade the student's work . Grades of CR and NC The grade of CR is given for Thesis, Thesis Renewal, and Professional Project. CR denotes satisfactory progress as determined by the instructor or thesis advisor. The grade of NC is given for selected courses such as Thesis and Thesis Renewal. NC denotes no credit due to lack of satisfactory progress as determined by the instructor or thesis advisor. Note: CR and NC do not count in calculating the student's grade point average. Class Attendance Students, whether present or absent, are responsible for all material presented in or assigned for courses, and will be held accountable for such material in the determination of course grades. Absences for athletic or school related participation are counted as any other absence, and all absences, whether athletic- related or not, should not exceed 25% of the class meetings and/or laboratory sessions scheduled for a course. Regular and punctual attendance, therefore, is expected and essential to success in a course. Accordingly, absence from more than 25% of class meetings and/or laboratory sessions scheduled for a course (including absences because of athletic participation) is regarded as excessive, and a grade of F may be assig ned as deemed appropriate by the professor. Grade Reports Grade reports are posted on HSU Central at the close of each semester and at the end of each summer term. Withdrawal During a Semester A student who finds it necessary to withdraw from the universit y before the end of the semester must secure the proper form for withdrawal through the Office of the Registrar. The form requires approval by the Business and Financial Aid Offices. If procedure is not followed, the student is automatically assigned a grade of F in all courses. However, no student may withdraw after the last date of withdrawal specified in the academic calendar. Acceptable Academic Progress (Criteria for acceptable academic progress may be superseded by program -specific guidelines. Please see individual programs for details.) In order to maintain acceptable academic progress, graduate students must maintain a 3.0 grade point average in all graduate work (when courses are repeated, only the most recent grade will be used to calculate grade points and semester hours) and may not obtain a grade of D, F, or WF in any graduate work. Should any of these situations occur, the student will be placed on academic probation. Financial aid has requirements regarding minimum completion of hours. Withdraw from a course (or courses) will affect the student's eligibility for financial aid in subsequent semesters. (See page 14.) Academic Probation When placed on academic probation, the student's graduate advisory committee must consider the student's potential for successful completion of the program and make a recommendation to the dean of graduate studies. A student may not be graduated while on academic probation. To return to good academic standing, the student must satisfy the dictates of their gr aduate advisory 28 committee and possess a GPA of 3.0 or better. Grade Appeal Process A student, who believes that the grading policy for a class has been unfairly administered, resulting in a course grade lower than expected, has the right to appeal the professor's decision on the grade. The following process is for appealing a course grade only, not for grades on individual projects or tests. For an appeal to be considered valid, each of the following steps must be taken in the order listed. 1. Discuss the matter with the professor. If at all possible, the matter is reconciled at this point. 2. If dissatisfied with this discussion, the student voices the concern to the program director in a conference scheduled by the student. The program director discusses the matter with the professor; another attempt is made to reconcile the matter. (If the professor is the program director, proceed to step three). 3. If the issue is not resolved to the student's satisfaction, the student submits a formal, written appeal to the dean of the academic area. The following must be included in the graduate student's appeal: a. A cover letter requesting reconsideration of the grade. b. A straightforward narrative (one to three pages) detailing the circumstances surrounding the contested grades, with special emphasis given to reasons why the student believes the grade is unwarranted. c. All graded projects in the class (tests, essays, projects, etc.) that are in the student's possession. d. The student's personal record of attendance in the class. 4. The program director forwards a recommendation on the matter to the dean of the academic area upon notification that the student has filed a grievance. 5. In writing, the dean of the academic area formally apprises the professor of the student's grievance and gives a summary of the points of concern. 6. The professor submits to the dean of the academic area a written response, which includes the projects in the professor's possession, grades on all work done in the course, and a copy of the class syllabus with the contested policy highlighted. 7. The dean of the academic area will meet with each party separately and may schedule a joint appointment with the two parties in order to attempt a solution. Petitions for exceptions to academic policies, other than for grade appeals, may only be made in writing to the dean of graduate studies. The graduate dean, in consultation with members of the Graduate Council, will make the final determination. No petitions will be considered from students on academic probation or suspension with a GPA below 3.0. If the student feels that additional appeal is necessary, then the last line of appeal is to the Graduate Studies Grievance Committee. The grievance committee is appointed by the Graduate Council from nominations submitted to them by the dean of graduate studies. GRADUATE STUDIES GRIEVANCE COMMITTEE Membership of the Grievance Committee The committee includes three graduate faculty professors from different academic areas with one specified to be the chair and two graduate students recruited from the Graduate Student Advisory Council. The chair of the committee will schedule meetings and preside during deliberations. Neither the professor nor the student will have counsel at the meetings. 29 Duties of the Grievance Committee The grievance committee will review all pertinent materials before the formal meeting and convene at a convenient time for the purpose of hearing the case. The grievance committee may request oral presentations by the parties. The committee will then convene in an executive session to reach a decision in the matter. The chair of the committee will inform in writing the student, faculty member, and the provost of the decision of the committee. If a grade is to be changed, the provost will see that the proper f orms are filled out in the Registrar's Office. The ruling of this committee is final. Procedures for Handling Student Grievances (other than grades) with Fellow Students, Faculty, or Staff Refer to page 60 of the HSU Student Handbook. COURSE AND CREDIT REQUIREMENTS Graduate Course Numbers 5000-5999 denotes graduate courses taught concurrent with an undergraduate courses (see notes below). 6000-7999 denotes graduate courses taught for graduate credit only. Note: A graduate student may earn graduate credit in a 5000- level course only if that course is being offered by a member of the graduate faculty and only if he/she has permission from his/her graduate advisor. A student desiring graduate credit in a 5000- level course is expected to do more work and bette r quality work than that done by a student enrolled for undergraduate credit. Note: The second number in 5000- level courses in performance in the School of Music does not denote number of credit hours. The course level or class is indicated by the first digit in the course number. The second digit indicates the semester hour value of the course (except in MUPS courses). The third and fourth digits indicate the departmental sequencing of the course and make it a unique number within the department or subje ct area. The semester hour is the unit of course credit at Hardin- Simmons University. Credit Hour Policy and Procedure This policy is designed to assure consistency in awarding academic credit at Hardin- Simmons University in conformity with commonly accepted standards in higher education and in accordance with federal regulations. In the following definition, HSU utilizes the Carnegie Unit, a generally recognized measurement for awarding academic credit, as a means to express the institution's definit ion of a credit hour. Definition of credit hour Using the Carnegie Unit as a commonly accepted standard, Hardin -Simmons University defines a credit hour, recorded by the university as a semester hour, in terms of instructional time and associated class preparation. Each credit hour reflects one hour of instructional time per week for a total of 15 instructional hours per semester. Graduate students are expected to spend a minimum of 3 hours in class preparation for each credit hour. Thus students are expected to spend a minimum of approximately 4 hours engaged in learning per week per semester for each credit hour. The application of this definition of credit hour must be equivalent throughout the curriculum. Faculty are responsible for assuring that at l east a reasonable approximation of a comparable amount of work consistent with this definition of credit hour is represented in all academic activities for which the university awards academic credit, including, but not limited to, distance education, blended courses, practice, internships, laboratory work, travel courses, and studio work. In 30 establishing equivalency, faculty should consider course content, method of delivery, pedagogical methods, and measurement of intended student learning outcomes, acade mic calendars, degree levels, and other factors to assure equivalency. The university grants credit only for courses approved by the academic policies established by the university and taught by faculty approved by the university. The process for approving course credit involves individual faculty members developing a new course proposal which is then vetted by the department and the curriculum committee of the appropriate college or school. If approved, the course proposal is sent to the Academic Committee of the University for discussion and final approval. In some cases the protocol requires approval of the University faculty. The process for approving course credit for graduate classes follows the same procedure with the exception that once approved by department and college/school, the course is sent to the Graduate council for discussion and approval, and finally to the Graduate Faculty for approval. Course Levels In all graduate programs, at least one- half of the co urses must be 6000 level courses. Maximum Course Load Students wishing to enroll for more than nine semester hours should consult with the academic advisor to consider whether the workload will negatively affect academic performance. Students wishing to take more than 12 hours of graduate st udy in a long term or more than six hours in a summer term must receive approval of the advisor and the dean of graduate studies. Transfer Credit Work completed before the student applies for admission at HSU, or completed at another institution after admission to HSU, may transfer if, 1) it is graduate work from a regionally accredited institution of higher education; 2) an official transcript of the work is on file in the Office of Graduate Studies; 3) the work was completed during the last 10 years; and 4) it is approved by the appropriate program or department. A maximum of 12 semester hours of approved graduate work may be transferred provided the student did not complete the previous degree. A maximum of six semester hours may be transferred from a previously completed degree. For the Master of Divinity degree's special policy for transfer work and for transfer work from a previous master's degree in religion, please see Logsdon Seminary Catalog. For the Physical Therapy policy for transfer work, see page 125 Distance Education for Out -of-State Enrollment On October 29, 2010, the U.S. Department of Education (USDOE) released new program integrity regulations. One of the regulations focused on the need for an institution offering distance education, i ncluding practicums, seminars, test proctoring, online courses and degree studies, to acquire authorization from any state in which it operates. This authorization is required to maintain eligibility for students of the state to receive federal financial a id. From October 2010, HSU has demonstrated a \"good faith effort to comply in each state in which it serves students. States with regulations in place expect that institutions already be in compliance with their regulations before serving any students in t heir state. On October 29, 2015, the State of Texas was approved by the Southern Regional Education Board (SREB) to join the State Authorization Reciprocity Agreement (SARA) under the administration of the Texas Higher Education Coordinating Board. In late Fall 2015, HSU was able to start the application process to join the SARA agreement for the State of Texas and is a 31 current member of the SARA agreement in the State of Texas. Hardin -Simmons University lists all states on our website that are part of the SARA agreement affording HSU permission to enroll students from these states in online coursework. We are working closely with non- SARA participating states to receive authorization. What This Means Before accepting enrollments from students residing in a non -SARA state, HSU must be in compliance with the distance learning regulations of the states in which students reside while enrolled. Some states require universities to seek approval before enrolling their residents, and the approval processes can be ex pensive and time intensive. What Hardin -Simmons University Is Doing HSU continues to work to obtain authorization from other non- SARA states. However, due to authorization and review processes associated with some states, we may be limited in our ability to accept some distance learning course enrollments. Please visit our website at www.hsutx.edu/online/ or contact the Provost Office, (325) 670 -1210 to inquire about the current status of your state with regar d to this USDOE state authorization requirement. Depending on the status of your state of residence regarding this requirement, HSU may notify you that you are not eligible to register for HSU distance education courses. In this case, Hardin - Simmons Unive rsity will provide assistance in finding alternatives. COMPLETION Graduation Requirements Graduation requirements are found under the curriculum heading of each program. Thesis The student whose program requires a thesis must register for Thesis after receiving approval from his/her graduate advisor. The student's committee approves the thesis topic and supervises the writing. Programs differ on style and requirements.

After beginning work on the thesis, continuous enrollment in Thesis or Thesis Renewal is required for all fall and spring semesters until the thesis is completed and accepted by the Office of Graduate Studies. Summer enrollment is required if the student anticipates working on the thesis or completing his/her thesis during either summer term. The student must meet all departmental and Office of Graduate Studies deadlines and requirements. A thesis processing fee is assessed. Diploma Card The deadline for filing Diploma Cards in the Registrar's Office is listed in the Academic Calendar in the front of this catalog. Students filing a diploma card after this date will be charged a late fee. The student should inform the Program Director if his/her graduation date changes. Participation in Graduation Exercises All candidates for degrees are requested to participate in the commencement ceremony. Candi dates must be enrolled in all courses required to complete the degree, including Thesis and Thesis Renewal (if applicable). Incomplete grades must be completed by the deadlines of April 15 (May graduation) and November 15 (December graduation).

Comprehensive Exam During the semester before completion of course work for the degree, students should obtain a reading list to guide them in preparing for the comprehensive exam. A committee approved by the program director in cooperation with the student will evaluate the student's performance on this exam. Students selecting a thesis option should expect to take the examination after acceptance of the thesis. Results of comprehensive exams in English will be posted as one of the following: 1. Pass with Distinction: The student proves exceptional mastery of the material. 2. Pass: The student successfully proves mastery of the material. 3. Fail: The student is unable to prove mastery of the material and has six months to sit for another exam. No degree will be granted should a second failure occur. Thesis Students selecting the thesis program prepare their theses in accordance with the guidelines of the department of English (MLA) and the Office of Graduate Studies. The thesis is supervised by a committee of three faculty members approved by the program director and approved by the dean of Grad uate Studies. Once the student begins work on the thesis, continuous enrollment in either Thesis or Thesis Renewal is required for all fall and spring semesters until completion. Summer enrollment is required if the student anticipates working on the thesi s or completing his/her degree during either summer term. Note: A thesis processing fee is assessed.

Ouimette, Program Director This program is designed to prepare graduates to assume management positions in the environmental service/compliance sector of public and private enterprises. It is an interdisciplinary program, drawing on a spectrum of campus -wide expertise, to craft a series of environmental management courses specifically designed for the program, always with real -world application in mind. Two degree tracks are available; a thesis track and a professional track, which utilizes an internship to bridge the graduate's transition from the academic to the professional world. Admission Criteria Applicants for graduate study in Environmental Management must hold a bachelor's degree from a regionally accredited college or university. Admission to the program requires the program director's endorsement, which will be based on evaluation of the following elements: 1. Prior academic performance, which will be evaluated in regard to: 1) overall GPA; 2) GPA in natural sciences; 3) overall upper level GPA; 4) previous graduate course work; and 5) fulfillment of necessary prerequisites (see below). An overall GPA of 2.7 or a GPA of 3.0 in either natural science courses, upper -level courses, or graduate courses is considered the norm. 2. If required, a Graduate Record Exam (GRE) score for the verbal and quantitative subsets or a full scale Graduate Management Admission Test (GMAT) score. Scores at the 50th percentile or higher are considered the norm. 3. A writing sample (personal essay) concerning the applicant's reason for applying and how the completion of the program will serve the applicant's career goals. 4. Occupational experience in either the environmental or health and safety field (include in the writing sample #3). 5. An interview with the program director. Early Admission Option (Combined BS/MS Degrees) This option is for undergraduate students at HSU who are enrolled in the environmental science minor and desire to pursue the MS degree in environmental management (ENVM). With proper scheduling, it is possible for a student to acquire both BS and MS degrees within five years. Students in their senior year who meet the entrance requirements for the ENVM program may be admitted to the program and take ENVM courses for graduate credit. Six hours of ENVM course work (to include ENVM 5311) will count toward the student's baccalaureate degree and reduce the hours required for the MS degree as long as a minimum of 30 hours is completed for the MS degree. Successful applicants may then attempt an additional nine semester hours of graduate course work, completing the first year of the ENVM program. Students who pursue this early admission option and are not subsequently admitted to the ENVM program or do not complete the program, will receive their baccalaureate degree, provided that all undergraduate degree requirements are met.

This entry -level professional degree prepares the graduate to be eligible for licensure and entry into the profession as a physical therapist. It is not necessary for applicants to hold a master's degree to pursue the DPT. Applications are generally accept ed a year in advance by applying to PTCAS (Physical Therapy Central Application System: www.ptcas.org) between July 1 and November 1. A new class begins each fall semester. There are two options for admission to the physical therapy program at Hardin -Simmo ns University: the early admission option and the post baccalaureate option. Accreditation The Doctor of Physical Therapy Program at Hardin -Simmons University is accredited by the Commission on Accreditation in Physical Therapy Education (CAPTE) of the Ame rican Physical Therapy Association. Post -professional degree programs offered through the Department of Physical Therapy are not eligible for, or subject to, CAPTE accreditation. Commission on Accreditation in Physical Therapy Education 1111 North Fair fax Street Alexandria, VA 22314 (703) 706- 3245; accreditation@apta.org ; www.capteonline.org Post Baccalaureate Option The applicant must have earned an undergra duate degree from a regionally accredited college or university and have completed the required prerequisite courses prior to beginning the physical therapy program. Early Admission Option This option is available for students attending HSU or other instit utions with which the program in physical therapy has developed a cooperative agreement for early admission: a current list of institutions participating in the early admission option can be obtained by calling or emailing the department (ptoffice@hsutx.edu). Students pursuing the early admission option complete most of their requirements for a degree in biology/kinesiology as specified by the institution where they are enrolled. These requirements include courses needed for the major in biology/kinesiolo gy, minor in an area of their choice and university core/general education/liberal arts requirements. In addition, students complete all courses needed to fulfill the prerequisite courses for the physical therapy program. Students make application to PTCAS during their third year. If accepted into the physical therapy program, selected upper division science course work during the first semester of the professional phase of the physical therapy program will count toward the undergraduate major in biology/ki nesiology. Transfer Credit Due to the curricular design (cohort) and financial structure of the DPT program (price/semester), it is extremely challenging to transfer into this program. Individuals will be considered on a case - by case basis if the followin g conditions can be met: 1) graduate work from a regionally accredited institution of higher education; 2) and official transcript of the work is on file in the Office of Graduate Studies; 3) the work was completed during the last 10 years; 4) approval by the 146 Program Director; 5) an open seat exist in the class the prospective student is transferring to. In general, the transfer student would likely sit through all courses in the curriculum, although some may not need to be retaken for credit. Tuition would remain the same no matter how many courses were being taken for credit.

Fair Use Guidelines There are four factors that determine Fair Use; (1) the purpose and character of the use, including whether such use is of a commercial nature or is for non- profit educational purposes; (2) the nature of the copyrighted work; (3) the amount and substantiality of the por tion used in relation to the copyrighted work as a whole; and (4) the effect of the use upon the potential market for or value of the copyrighted work. This document was drafted with the assumption that the nature of usage is for supporting university curr iculum. The guidelines below are designed to help identify the remaining requirements. Those wishing to use copyrighted materials for uses other than for supporting university curriculum should identify the applicable restrictions and abide by them. For m ore information please see: http://www.hsutx.edu/library/fair_use_handout.pdf 159 ACADEMIC INTEGRITY POLICY Students are expected to do their own academic work; therefore, academic dishonesty will not be tolerated. Faculty and students are encouraged to take an aggressive approach to combating acts of inappropriate academic behavior. Academic dishonesty occurs when a student submits the work of someone else as his/her own or has special information for use in an evaluation activity that is not available to other students in the same activity. Students who observe or become aware of violations of academic integrity are urged to report these violations to the professor in whose course the dishonest acts occur. Examples include but may not be limited to the following: 1. Cheating on an examination: a) Copying from another student's examination. b) Possessing or using during an examination material not authorized by the person giving the exam. c) Collaborating with or seeking aid from anothe r student during an exam without permission from the instructor. d) Knowingly using, buying, selling, stealing, transporting, or soliciting in whole or in part the contents of an unadministered examination. e) Substituting for another student or permitting another student to substitute for oneself to take a test. f) Obtaining an unadministered test or information about an unadministered test. 2. Plagiarism is the appropriation, buying, receiving as a gift, or obtaining by any means, another person's work and the unacknowledged submission or incorporation of it as one's own work. This could include the failure to specifically cite sources. Penalties Penalties may range from dismissal from the University to a lesser penalty. If the penalty is an F for the course in which the violation occurred, the F will count in the computation of the student's GPA even if the course is repeated. Procedures for Violation 1. At the point of discovery, the instructor shall inform the student of the alleged violation of academic integrity and hear his/her explanation of the circumstances. If the instructor determines there is no violation, the case is dropped. If the instructor decides the violation is unintentional or minor, the instructor may decide to require the student to rewrite the pape r in question, take a modified exam, or take some similar action. If, in the judgment of the instructor, the alleged violation is deemed to be serious and intentional, the instructor will follow the procedure outlined below in steps 2-5. 2. Before imposing a penalty for a violation, the instructor shall consult with his/her immediate supervisor and together they will agree on a penalty. The instructor shall then make a written report outlining the incident and the recommended penalty. A copy of the report shall be given to the supervisor, the head of the department and the dean of the school or college in which the course is offered, the Office of the Provost, the student and the student's advisor. The instructor shall inform the student, in writing, of the rig ht to appeal the change of violating academic integrity. 3. From the point of discovery, and within 10 working days, the instructor shall complete the process outlined above. 4. The Office of the Provost shall maintain files of all violations of academic integrity. 160 5. The student has the right to appeal the charge of violating academic integrity and/or the penalty assessed in accordance with the following appeals process. Procedure for Appeal 1. A student appealing a charge of academic integrity vi olation and/or a penalty must deliver a letter to the chair of the Grade Appeal and Academic Misconduct Committee, specifying the basis for the appeal, within 10 working days after receiving the instructor's written report. 2. The chair of the committee will schedule a meeting of the committee as soon as practical, after receipt of the letter of appeal, preferably within 10 working days. The chair will notify the student and the instructor of the meeting date and time. 3. Copies of the instructor's report and the student's letter of appeal will be provided to all members of the committee at least two working days before the day of the meeting. 4. The committee will review the materials submitted by both the student and the instructor before the formal meeting and convene at a time convenient for all involved for the purpose of hearing the two individuals present their cases. The committee will then convene in an executive session to reach a decision in the matter. The chair of the committee will inform, in writing, the student, the student's advisor, the instructor, the instructor's immediate supervisor, the head of the department and the dean of the school or college in which the course is offered, and the Office of the Provost of the decision. 5. If the appeal is denied, then the charge and the penalty is upheld. If an appeal of a charge of violating academic integrity is upheld, the case is dismissed. If an appeal of a penalty is upheld, then the committee will determine an appropriate penalty. Th e ruling of the committee is final. Action, or failure to take action, by an instructor or the Appeals Committee does not preclude disciplinary action by the University when appropriate. 161 BOARD OF TRUSTEES Officers Dr. Mike Waters , Chair Dr. George Newman, Vice -Chair Mrs. Roxi Vanstory , Vice - Chair and Assistant Secretary Mrs. Laura Moore , Secretary Members Mr. Bryan Adams , The Woodlands, TX Dr. Kevin Beam , Cleburne, TX Col.
