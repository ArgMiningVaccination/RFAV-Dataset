Petersen, DVM, PhD, DABVP (Feline), Jane Welfare), GradCert Ed Stud (Higher Ed) ABSTRACT The guidelines are a consensus report on current recommendations for vaccination of cats of any origin, authored by a Task Force of experts. The guidelines are published simultaneously in the Journal of Feline Medicine and Surgery (volume 22, issue 9, pages 813 -830, DOI: 10.1177/1098612X20941784) and the Journal of the American Animal Hospital Association (volume 56, issue 4, pages 249 -265, DOI: 10.5326/JAAHA-MS-7123). The guidelines assign approved feline vaccines to core (recommended for all cats) and non-core (recommended based on an individualized risk-bene t assessment) cate- gories. Practitioners can develop individualized vaccination protocols consisting of core vaccines and non-core vaccinesbased on exposure and susceptibility risk as de ned by the patient 's life stage, lifestyle, and place of origin and by environmental and epidemiologic factors. An update on feline injection-site sarcomas indicates that occurrence of thissequela remains infrequent and idiosyncratic. Staff education initiatives should enable the veterinary practice team to beprocient in advising clients on proper vaccination practices and compliance. Vaccination is a component of a preventive healthcare plan. The vaccination visit should always include a thorough physical exam and client education dialog thatgives the pet owner an understanding of how clinical staff assess disease risk and propose recommendations that helpensure an enduring owner-pet relationship.

These guidelines provide the most current infor- mation and recommendations for feline vaccination as determinedby a Task Force of experts in feline practice. The recommendations are evidence-guided, based on current peer-reviewed literature and data, and complemented by clinical insights collectively derived from decades of experience. The guidelines update the 2013 AAFP Feline Vaccination Advisory Panel Report and utilize similar recommenda- tions from the 2016 WSA VA [World Small Animal Veterinary As- sociation] Guidelines for the Vaccination of Dogs and Cats . 1,2Both of these previously published resources should still be considered rel- evant and actionable complements to the 2020 guidelines. The guidelines continue the established approach of considering inclusion of core (recommended for all cats) and non-core (rec- ommended based on an individualized risk-bene t assessment) vaccines in an individualized protocol. As explained in the guidelines, a patient-speci c vaccination plan should consider environmental risk factors and life stage and lifestyle factors that determine the likelihood of infectious disease exposure and susceptibility. For example, not all feline patients originate from a home environment,and conversely, most cats described as \"indoor only \"might nd themselves periodically exposed to other cats. The guidelines discuss other presentation scenarios that can potentially affect a risk-bene t assessment and include updates on feline injection-site sarcomas (FISSs) and other vaccination-related reactions. A key component of the guidelines are comprehensive, easy-to- reference tables listing approved core and non-core feline vaccines and the relevant considerations for their use. The guidelines are com- plemented by an online resource center at aaha.org/felinevaccination and supplemental materials at catvets.com/vaccination. The online resources include frequently asked questions about vaccination that clinicians and pet owners raise as well as a vaccine protocol calculatorthat uses a cat 's life stage and lifestyle information to suggest an appropriate, individualized vaccination protocol. The guidelines discuss in some detail the importance of staff and client education in implementing vaccination protocols and rec- ommendations for feline patients. This emphasis is noteworthy in view of the fact that many pet owners, especially cat owners, associate professional veterinary care primarily with two events, vaccinationand treatment of acute conditions. 3Thus, a healthcare visit for the purposes of vaccination becomes an opportunity to more broadly discuss an overall preventive healthcare strategy with the pet owner. Implicit in this approach is an explanation of how the clinicianconsiders life stage, lifestyle, patient health status, environmental, and epidemiologic factors in making vaccination recommendations.The vaccination event then occurs in the context of a practitioner-client discussion on how preventive healthcare forms the basis forthe pet owner to maintain a long, rewarding relationship with theanimal in his or her care. Vaccination Principles Active immunization, achieved through proper vaccination, plays acritical role in the control of infectious diseases, both for individualcats and for the cat population as a whole. Some vaccines also reducethe potential for spread of zoonotic infections to humans (e.g., ra-bies). The bene ts of routine, widespread vaccination are clear: the incidence of serious disease caused by pathogenic organisms, such asfeline panleukopenia virus (FPV), can be reduced dramatically whenwidespread vaccination is practiced. However, the quality of vaccine-induced immunity is in fluenced by the patient 's environment, the characteristics of the vaccine, the pathogen, and the patient 's immune competence. Accurate prediction of the outcome of vacci- nation or the likelihood of exposure to a pathogen is impossible. Therefore, it is important that veterinarians inform cat owners thatvaccination is not a guarantee of protection. In general, kittens are more susceptible to infection and disease than adults. Thus, they represent a primary target population forimmunization. As part of a routine wellness program, the vaccinationneeds of all cats should be assessed annually, in conjunction with acomprehensive physical examination, modifying vaccination andother control recommendations as necessary based on the currentrisk (see \"Vaccination Risk-Bene t Assessment \"). Kittens born to immune queens lack signi cant transplacentally acquired antibodies 4and instead absorb speci c maternally derived antibodies (MDA) through colostrum, which provides importantprotection during early life. Most absorption occurs within 24 hoursof birth. However, this MDA also interferes with MDA inhibits immunoglobulin productionwithin feedback mechanisms. It alsoneutralizes vaccine antigens and prevents them from stimulating animmune response. MDA then declines at a variable rate. Maternallyderived IgG in kittens in one study was lowest at around 3 -4 weeks of age, and serum IgG and IgA increased dramatically at 5 -7 weeks of age. 4These results suggested that kittens may be susceptible to infectious diseases at about 1 month of age, perhaps as much as2 weeks earlier than puppies. Nevertheless, it is critical to recognize that there is considerable individual variation in the rate of decline of MDA, and some kittensmaintain high concentrations for months. 5The persistence of MDA is one of the most common reasons for vaccine failure. The amount 250 JAAHA | 56:5 Sep/Oct 2020of MDA in a kitten at any one time point cannot be predicted be- cause it varies depending on the titer of the dam and the amount ofcolostrum ingested after birth. As a result, a series of vaccinations is administered to kittens every 2 -4 weeks through 16 -18 weeks of age in order to increase the chance that successful immunization will occursoon after the decline of MDA to suf ciently low titers. The series is started no sooner than 4 weeks of age, because neonates are morelikely to develop vaccine organism -associated disease and may not respond well to vaccination. During administration of the series, awindow exists when MDA concentrations are high enough to in-terfere with immunization but are not suf cient to prevent natural infection. This window of susceptibility can be minimized by de- creasing the interval between vaccinations in the series, although useof intervals less than 2 weeks can interfere with successful immu-nization, especially with attenuated live vaccines. Once vaccination has been successfully achieved after the de- cline of MDA, it is generally recommended that a booster vaccine be given 3 -4 weeks later (this is especially important for inactivated vaccines, although a boostering effect will also occur following revaccination with attenuated live vaccines). This means that the series must be extended 3 -4 weeks beyond the period in which the decline in MDA occurs, with the nal vaccination dose being a booster. In the past, it was recommended that revaccination be performed1 year after the initial kitten series, and then for most vaccines every3 years thereafter. However, owing to studies that suggest up to one-third of kittens may fail to respond to a nal core vaccine at 16 weeks and may have blocking MDA at 20 weeks, the WSA VArecommends that the 1 year vaccine (feline viral rhinotracheitis-calicivirus-panleukopenia only) be replaced with revaccination at6 months of age. 2,6,7 In this update, this Task Force has adopted the same recom- mendation of revaccination against FPV, feline herpesvirus type 1(FHV-1), and feline calicivirus (FCV) at 6 months of age to potentiallyreduce the window of susceptibility in kittens with MDA toward theend of the kitten series (16 -18 weeks). The Task Force recognizes that this means an additional visit will still be necessary for adminis-tration of the annual feline leukemia virus (FeLV) and rabies vac-cinations in young cats. The risk of infection and disease varies with factors such as the age and health of the cat, magnitude of exposure to the infectious agent,the pathogenicity of the agent, and the vaccination history of the cat.Some of the factors that impact an individual animal 's ability to re- spond to vaccination include interference from MDA, congenital oracquired immunode ciency, concurrent disease, inadequate nutri- tion, chronic stress, and very young or old age. Some vaccines (e.g.,those for FPV) induce a stronger protective response than others (e.g.,those for FHV-1). Because vaccine-induced protection is variable andnot absolute, vaccination should not be used as the only form of protection, and other control measures, such as those that reduceexposure to infectious agents, should also be employed. Types of Feline Vaccines Vaccines, including those from different manufacturers that are li-censed to protect against the same pathogen, should not be assumedas equivalent. Differences in processes and technology used toproduce vaccines, as well as additives such as adjuvants, and vaccineroute of administration in fluence ef cacy, safety, and duration of immunity. Vaccines may be inactivated, attenuated live, or recom-binant ( Table 1 ). All veterinary vaccines, before licensing, are assessed for ef cacy, safety, potency, and purity. Vaccine ef cacy is often expressed as preventable fraction ,d ened as the proportion of vaccinated animals that do not develop a disease after challenge (so-called sterilizing immunity, e.g., FPV, FeLV, and rabies vaccines),compared with unvaccinated animals that do develop the disease. Itcan also be expressed as mitigatable fraction (proportion with re- duction in severity of clinical signs, e.g., FHV-1 and FCV vaccines) . Other claims include reduction of pathogen shedding, prevention of a speci c clinical sign, or prevention of mortality. The level or de- gree of protection claim can therefore be limited. Inactivated vaccines are vaccines in which the target pathogen is \"killed \"and therefore unable to replicate in the host. Although these vaccines are unable to revert to virulence, they often contain adju-vants and other excipient proteins to promote an adequate immuneresponse, which have been implicated in acute and delayed adversereactions in cats. Inactivated vaccines produce weaker immune re-sponses of shorter duration when compared with attenuated livevaccines, and more frequent booster immunizations may be required(generally annually). With the exception of rabies, two initial doses ofvaccine 3 -4 weeks apart in the absence of MDA are absolutely essential to produce an effective immune response, and if more than 6 weekselapses between these doses, it is recommended in other guidelinesreports that the series be repeated. 2,8Full protection may not develop until 2 -3 weeks after the last dose. Inactivated vaccines are generally considered safer than attenuated live vaccines for use during pregnancyand in immunosuppressed animals, although systemic allergic reac-tions could still jeopardize pregnancy. Attenuated live vaccines (modi ed live vaccines) contain mi- croorganisms that are arti cially manipulated so as to reduce their virulence or are eld strains of low virulence. Repeated passage through cell culture is the most common means of attenuation.Because organisms in attenuated live vaccines replicate in the host,they stimulate an immune response that more closely mimicsprotection from natural infection. There is generally a more rapidonset of immunity than with inactivated vaccines, and, in the2020 AAHA/AAFP Feline Vaccination Guidelines JAAHA.ORG 251absence of MDA, only one dose of vaccine may be suf cient to provide protection. Partial immunity after vaccination with a singledose of attenuated live FPV vaccines can occur within hours. 9-11In addition, live vaccine organisms that are shed can immunize otheranimals in a population. However, the potential for vaccine or-ganism -induced disease exists. This is most likely to occur in immunosuppressed animals, such as neonates that are youngerthan 4 weeks old. In addition, use of attenuated live vaccines ismore likely to result in the generation of false-positive results asindicated by diagnostic tests that are designed to detect thetarget pathogen (antigen or nucleic acid). With prolongedshedding of live vaccine organisms, this can be a problem forweeks after vaccination. All bacterial and viral vaccines licensedfor intranasal administration in c ats are attenuated live, as are a number of parenteral vaccines. Recombinant vaccines are created through manipulation of the deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) of a pathogen in the laboratory, withreduction in pathogen virulence. Types of recombinant vaccines include subunit, deletion mutant, vectored, and DNA vaccines.Currently, the only available recombinant vaccines for cats in NorthAmerica are vectored vaccines, which use a recombinant canarypoxvirus as a vector. In these vaccines, DNA of the pathogen that en-codes for an immunogenic antigen is incorporated into the canar-ypox genome, which then undergoes aborted (limited) replicationin the host with expression of the immunogen, in turn inciting aprotective immune response. Compared with inactivated vaccines,canarypox vectors offer a more rapid onset of immunity and may bemore effective in the face of persistent MDA. Canarypox-vectoredvaccines also do not require adjuvant and have been associated with areduced risk of injection-site sarcomas in cats. 12However, one study suggested that the degree of protection induced by the recombinantc a n a r y p o xF e L Vv a c c i n em a yn o tb ea sr o b u s ta st h a ti n d u c e db ywhole inactivated FeLV vaccines, 13which might produce sterilizing immunity.14However, moderate to severe immunosuppressionTABLE 1 Types of Feline Vaccines and Their Attributes 252 JAAHA | 56:5 Sep/Oct 2020may have impacted the results, so further studies are required to determine whether a clinically important difference exists. T o facilitate vaccine selection, vaccines for dogs and cats have been divided into core vaccines, non-core vaccines, and those generally notrecommended. Core vaccines are for all cats with an unknown vacci- nation history. The targeted diseases cause signi cant morbidity and mortality and are widely distributed. In general, vaccination for corediseases results in good protection. The Task Force recommendsvaccines for FHV-1, FCV , FPV , rabies, and younger 1year old) as core vaccines ( Table 2 , pet cats; Table 3 , shelter-housed cats). Non-core vaccines are optional vaccines that should be consid- ered in the light of exposure risk; that is, based on geographic dis-tribution and the lifestyle of the cat ( Table 4 ). Optional or non-core vaccines for cats include FeLV (for cats older than1 year), Chlamydia felis, andBordetella bronchiseptica vaccines. The not generally recommended category of vaccines pertains to diseases of low clinical signi cance or that respond readily to treatment; vaccines for which evidence of ef cacy in the eld is minimal; or vaccines that may produce a relatively higher incidence of adverse events with limited bene t. The Task Force lists the feline infectious peritonitis (FIP) vaccine as not generally recommended (Table 5 ). This vaccine is labeled for administration from 16 weeks of age, whereasmany kittens become infected with coronaviruses well before this age. Italso contains a serotype II strain of FIP virus. Serotype I FIP virusstrains predominate in have cross-reactive neu- tralizing epitopes with serotype II strains. Therefore, as noted in theprevious iteration of these guidelines, 1,33there remains insuf cient ev- idence that this vaccine induces clinically relevant protection in theeld. The decision to vaccinate, even with core vaccines, should be based on a risk-bene t assessment for each cat and for each vaccine antigen. Bene ts of vaccination should be balanced against the risk of adverse events, likelihood of exposure, and disease severity. Everyeffort should be made to ensure that cats are healthy before vacci-nation. However, concurrent illness (including retroviral infections)does not necessarily preclude vaccination. 34The 2020 AAFP Feline Retrovirus Testing and Management Guidelines state that vaccines should notbe avoided in cats with retroviral infection because they can develop more severe clinical disease related to FPV and upperrespiratory tract infections after natural exposure compared withuninfected cats. 34 Potential Therapeutic Bene ts of Vaccination Active immunization can enhance non-speci c immunity, leading to reduction in disease caused by non-target pathogens. One studyshowed that vaccination of cats with an intranasal FHV-1-FCVvaccine was associated with reduction in clinical signs followingchallenge with B bronchiseptica . 24More studies are needed to assess the non-target effects of different vaccine types. There is also interestin whether vaccines might provide therapeutic benets in cats al- ready infected with target pathogens. Improvement in chronic up-per respiratory tract signs that were previously refractory to othertreatments was documented in 13 cats vaccinated with an intranasalFHV-1-FCV vaccine. 35Most vaccines, however, provide no thera- peutic bene t, as clearly documented for FeLV vaccines.36 Vaccination Risk-Bene t Assessment The Task Force supports the WSAVA 's recommendation that veterinarians should vaccinate every animal with core vaccines and give non-corevaccines no more frequently than is deemed necessary. 2The decision whether or not to administer a vaccine to a cat, and how frequently, relieson an individual case-by-case assess ment by the veterinarian. This in- volves consideration of the animal, the animal 's environment, and the pathogen in question. Additionally, risk-bene t assessments should consider the safety of the vaccine, other adverse effects of vaccination(e.g., the effect of feline immunode ciency virus vaccination on in-clinic diagnostic test kits), and the ef cacy of the vaccine. The result of this assessment should be an individualized, evidence-guided recommenda- tion to vaccinate or not to vaccinate. Patient 's Characteristics Age is an important factor in assessing an individual 'sr i s kp r o le. In contrast to puppies, kittens born to immune queens appear to lacktransplacentally acquired antibodies and instead absorb speci cM D A through colostrum, 4w h i c hp r o v i d e si m p o r t a n tp r o t e c t i o nd u r i n ge a r l y life. Once MDA have waned, however, kittens become susceptible toinfection. Most infectious diseases are more prevalent in kittens thanadults, and therefore, kittens (in particular, those younger than 6months old) represent a principal p rimary target population for vac- cination. Conversely, adult cats generally have a more robust adaptiveA Balancing Act There is always a balance to be struck when considering risks as- sociated with vaccination and benets of vaccination for the individualpatient: \u00b7A decision to vaccinate might involve a young cat resid- ing in a multi-cat household with outdoor access, livingin an area with a known high prevalence of the pathogenbeing vaccinated against. \u00b7A decision not to vaccinate might involve a senior or geri- atric cat residing in a single-cat household with no outdooraccess, and a vaccine that has poor ef cacy against a path- ogen with low virulence or limited local prevalence.2020 AAHA/AAFP Feline Vaccination Guidelines JAAHA.ORG 253TABLE 2 Core Vaccines for Pet Cats 254 JAAHA | 56:5 Sep/Oct 2020TABLE 2 Table 2 continued 2020 AAHA/AAFP Feline Vaccination Guidelines JAAHA.ORG 255TABLE 3 Core Vaccines for Shelter-Housed Cats 256 JAAHA | 56:5 Sep/Oct 2020immune response when challenged (assuming they are healthy and not immunocompromised), whether due to previous natural exposure orvaccination, and age-related resist ance to challenge is particularly a feature of FeLV infection. 26Consequently, vaccination of mature cats is generally considered less critical t han vaccination of kittens. The pres- ence of concurrent disease or stress causing immunosuppression shouldalso be a consideration prior to vaccination because this may affect ananimal 's susceptibility to infection and response to vaccination. Patient 's Environment Population density and opportunity for exposure to infectious agents are two critical issues that should form part of the risk-bene t assessment. In general, cats and kittens living in larger multi-cathouseholds and environments (e.g., boarding, breeding, foster, orshelter facilities) have a higher risk of infection than cats living in one-or two-cat households. In addition to the possible presence of infectedanimals acting as reservoirs for infection in multi-cat households, theimmunosuppressive effects of stress associated with high-density felinehousing may result in reactivation of some infections as well as in-creased susceptibility to new infections. The introduction of new catsinto multi-cat households also increases the risk of infectious diseasenot only to the cat entering the household but also to the whole group because of possible direct exposure to new infectious agents. When assessing the opportunity for exposure to a given pathogen f o ra ni n d i v i d u a lc a t ,t h el i f e s t y l eo ft h ec a ta n do t h e rc a t si nt h es a m e household needs to be considered. It is critical to determine whether the cat is indoor-only or has outdoor access (including supervised outdoorvisits on a harness, or boarding) because cats with outdoor access may beat increased risk of pathogen exposure. Indoor-only cats, however, mays t i l lb ed e t e r m i n e dt ob ea tr i s ko fe x p o s u r et op a t h o g e n s ,e i t h e rf r o mother cats in the household (i.e., subclinically infected or carrier cats), orby fomite transmission of pathogens brought in from outside on theowner 's body, clothing, or shoes. Indoor-only cats may also be exposed to infectious agents when brought to a veterinary clinic for a wellnessexamination. In theory, strictly indoor cats may be more susceptible todeveloping some infectious diseas es (such as FPV and FCV infection) than cats with outdoor access because they may not receive \"natural boosting of immunity \"that occurs with natural exposure. 1 The geographic distribution of infectious agents may also result in different risks of exposure (e.g., rabies), and therefore, questionsregarding future travel should be included in determining the risk ofexposure to speci c infectious agents. TABLE 5 Not Generally Recommended Vaccines for Pet Cats TABLE 4 Non-Core Vaccines for Pet Cats 2020 AAHA/AAFP Feline Vaccination Guidelines JAAHA.ORG 257Infectious Agents The likelihood of infection and disease is in fluenced by pathogen factors such as virulence, strain variation, and challenge dose(i.e., how many infectious units of exposure). The need for vacci- nation is greatest against pathogens with high virulence, such as FPV, and pathogens that cause widespread morbidity, such as FHV-1. Creating an Individualized, Lifestyle-Based Vaccination Plan The vaccination needs of each cat should be evaluated individually and rationally, based on health status, age, and possible, realisticexposure to disease ( Table 6 ). Owners and veterinarians must work together to determine the likelihood of the animal coming intocontact with other animals that may spread disease, acquiring par-asites that may harbor a disease-causing agent, or living in an areawhere a disease is known to be endemic or very widespread. 2 Questions must be asked about the lifestyle of that speci c cat as well as any other cats in the household or potentially introduced into thehousehold. The travel, boarding, housing, and enrichment activities orexcursions outside of the home should also be considered. 1This risk assessment for exposure to disease should be done at least once a year. T h el i f es t a g eo ft h ec a tm u s ta l s ob ec o n s i d e r e dw i t hr e s p e c tt o possibility of exposure to disease and the health status of the animal.Infectious diseases are more prevalent in kittens, and in general, kittens(younger than 6 months old) are more susceptible to infection. 1Younger cats also tend to behave more unpredictably and require more enrich-ment activities, which may increase their opportunity for exposure. 37 The health status of the individual cat, including any previously documented adverse events to vaccine s, also determines the vaccination recommendations. The nutritional status, general health (i.e., anyconcurrent infections or other dis ease) and the pregnancy status of females may change the type and schedule of vaccination for that in-dividual cat (Table 6). As with lifestyle changes, changes in health statusmust be evaluated at least yearly. 1The population density, along with the opportunity for expo- sure to other cats, is a major factor in determining the need forvaccination. Larger multi-cat households are likely to have a greaterrisk of infection and disease than households of one or two cats. Theintroduction of new cats and the social dynamics of the group mayalso cause immunosuppressive stress, leading to increased risk ofdisease by new infection or recrudescence. Each cat in a multi-catenvironment must have a vaccination plan that balances the pro-tection of the individual with that of the household population. 1 Cats entering boarding, breeding, foster, or shelter situations have increased risk of disease exposure as well as systemic stress. Vaccinationmay be warranted prior to entering these environments when possible(see Tables 2 and 3). Additionally, vaccination intervals may need to beshortened depending upon these possible scenarios. 1As with multi-cat households, the vaccination plan for the individual cat must be con-s i d e r e di nr e l a t i o nt ot h ee n t i r ep o p u l a t i o n . One vaccination plan or protocol cannot be applied to every cat. Each animal must be evaluated and an individualized plan created thatwill most protect that particular cat. That plan must be reassessed when changes in health and lifestyle occur, requiring client education and compliance with at least yearly veterinary visits. 38 Feline Patient Populations For the purpose of creating speci c, individualized vaccination rec- ommendations based on risk of exposure, the Task Force has identi ed and de ned the following feline populat ions based on their environment and lifestyle. The guidelines begin by discussing pet cats and then discussa number of feline populations that are considered to be at relatively highrisk of infectious disease exposure \u2014namely, shelter cats, trap-neuter- return/trap-neuter-release cats, cattery cats, and foster cats. Pet Cats Pet cats include any cat kept by human beings as a source ofcompanionship and pleasure. Pet cats are further categorized by TABLE 6 Risk Assessment Variables Determining an Individualized Vaccination Plan 258 JAAHA | 56:5 Sep/Oct 2020housing status (indoor, outdoor, or indoor-outdoor cats) and number of cats in the household (single-cat or larger multi-cat).Although these distinctions are important, the most signi cant is- sue to consider regarding vaccination of pet cats is the individual cat 's exposure risk and exposure frequency to other cats and feline in-fectious diseases. Even indoor cats from single-cat households willinevitably be exposed to other feline infectious pathogensin situations such as a veterinary clinic visit, contact with other catsentering the premises, or exposure to contaminated fomites intro-duced by human contact. Client education for owners of thesepatients should focus on risk of exposure to other cats rather thanon where the cat eats, sleeps, or spends most of its time. For high-risk, multi-cat households, the probability of infectious disease exposure and transmission is proportionate to the number ordensity of cats on the premises. 39It is important to educate clients about the increased disease risks to this population of cats and to discuss in-creased owner responsibility to ensure appropriate preventive healthcare initiatives associated with housing many cats in a con ned space. Shelter Cats These are cats living for indeterminate periods in centers for relinquished or lost animals. Trap-Neuter-Return/Trap-Neuter-Release Cats These are community or feral cats of either sex that live entirely separatefrom people and cannot safely be handled. Trap-neuter-release/trap-neuter-return cats may survive completely independently of humans,but some semiferal colonies receive support from individuals. Cattery Cats These cats are maintained in commercial facilities; for example,breeding or boarding facilities, and pet stores with a showcase model. Foster Cats Foster cats are kittens or adult cats temporarily housed for rescue,rehabilitation, and rehoming purposes. The most important con-sideration in a foster cat household is ensuring that the permanentpopulation of the household is appropriately vaccinated to provideprotection from disease exposure originating with foster cats. Serology and Diagnostics The interpretation of an antibody test result can be complex becauseantibody testing is used for many reasons. Depending on the anti-bodies tested for, antibody testing can be used for (1) diagnosis ofinfection, (2) identi cation of previous exposure to pathogens (particularly in unvaccinated animals), and (3) assessment of im-munity prior to or following vaccination ( Table 7 ). Clinicians shouldunderstand when and why to perform antibody testing and use this knowledge to make evidence-based decisions prior to vaccination. Hemagglutination inhibition (for FPV) and serum neutralization (for FHV-1, FCV, and rabies) are the reference standards to determinethe presence of effective antibody-mediated immunity. These testmethodologies can only be performed in a laboratory setting using livecell cultures (i.e., they cannot be performed in a practice using rapidpatient-side test kits). These diagnostic tests are predominantly re-search tools used in vaccine ef cacy and prevalence studies. It is important when attempting to demonstrate protective im- munity in a patient using an in-clinic antibody test kit that the per-formance of the kit be compared against the appropriate referencestandard in order to demonstrate correlation with protective immunity. The presence of anti-FPV antibodies correlates strongly with protection (Table 7). Currently, experts recommend antibody testingfor FPV to assess immunity and inform decisions about whether tovaccinate. 6,40Rapid in-clinic test kits to detect antibodies to FPV, FHV-1, and FCV are available to veterinarians in North America andhave been validated in two different studies using the appropriate reference tests. 47,48Of concern, however, was the occurrence of some anti-FPV antibody false-positive results in one study, which inpractice would lead to some unprotected cats not being vaccinated. 48 Adverse Postvaccination Reactions Although the administration of biological products is never entirelyfree of risk, currently available feline vaccines have an excellent safetyrecord. That said, the true prevalence of adverse reactions is likely tobe underestimated owing to underreporting by both veterinariansand owners. 49Therefore, it is important to report any known or suspected negative events associated with vaccination. In the UnitedStates, veterinarians are requested to contact the manufacturer(Veterinary Technical Services) of the vaccine(s) considered to beinvolved.

At the time of vaccine administration, included in the patient 's permanent medical record should be the name, serial number, ex-piration date and manufacturer of the vaccine(s) given, date ofadministration, name of the person administering the vaccine(s),and the site and route of the vaccine administration. Adverse events2020 AAHA/AAFP Feline Vaccination Guidelines JAAHA.ORG 259should be recorded in a manner that will clearly alert all staff members during future visits. Prevalence and Types of Adverse Reactions Postvaccination adverse events in cats are considered rare.49In the most substantial survey to date, any adverse reactions were recordedfor cats presented to Ban eld Pet Hospitals in the United States between 2002 and 2005. 42During this period, more than 1.25 million doses of various vaccines were administered to nearly500,000 cats. Adverse reactions within 30 days of vaccination werereported at a rate of 0.52% of cats vaccinated. The most commonlyreported vaccine reactions are lethargy, anorexia and fever for a fewdays after vaccination, or local in flammation at the site of injec- tion. 42,50,51In the Ban eld Pet Hospital population, the risk of an adverse reaction was greatest in cats around 1 year of age and/orincreased as the total volume of vaccine and number of vaccinesadministered concurrently increased. 42 Hypersensitivity Reactions Although anaphylaxis (type I hypersensitivity reaction) is rare(approximately 1 -5 per 10,000 vaccinations), 42,52it may manifest as vomiting, diarrhea, respiratory distress, facial or generalized pruri-tus, facial swelling, and collapse. 51,53,54Where revaccination is con- sidered necessary in a cat that has experienced an allergic reaction,using a different vaccine formulation and premedicating with an antihistamine and glucocorticoid 20 -30 minutes prior to vaccine administration is recommended, followed by close observation ofthe patient for several hours. 42,53Other forms of hypersensitivity reactions (types II, III, and IV) almost certainly also occur in catsafter vaccination, but these are rarely documented. Postvaccination Monitoring The Task Force recommends that veterinarians and owners monitorthe vaccination site for swelling or lumps using the \"3-2-1 \"rule. Biopsy of any mass present is warranted if it (1) remains present3 months after vaccination, (2) is larger than 2 cm in diameter, or(3) is increasing in size 1 month after vaccination. 1,55It is recom- mended to obtain an incisional biopsy on any masses meeting any ofthese criteria. Fine-needle aspirates may not provide diagnosticcellular tissue, whereas excisional biopsies rarely meet appropriatemargins (5 cm in two fascial planes) as required in the case ofinjection-site sarcomas, thus increasing the morbidity and mortalityrisks associated with sarcoma invasion. Update on Feline Injection-Site Sarcomas FISSs, largely caused by vaccines (although other materials have beenimplicated), have been recognized since 1991. 56Three decades later, much about them remains unknown. Within the United States, FISSTABLE 7 Possible Uses of In-Clinic Serology Testing 260 JAAHA | 56:5 Sep/Oct 2020incidence estimates, although low, have varied by at least an order of magnitude, and worldwide FISS incidence estimates vary by countrydepending on the relative use of vaccine types (e.g., FeLV, rabies)and population susceptibility. The Task Force makes the following observations regarding vaccination: \u00b7Neither vaccinating in the interscapular space nor decreasing vaccine volume is recommended. \u00b7Distal limb injection is recommended to facilitate amputationwith 5 cm margins in two fascial planes in the case of injection-site sarcoma ( Figure 1 ). \u00b7More recently, ventral abdominal subcutaneous injections have been used because of the perceived relative ease of tumor removalwithout the need for amputation. 2However, the need to remove two fascial planes and 5 cm margins would still necessitate ag-gressive tissue removal from the abdomen and abdominal cavity. \u00b7Tail vaccination has also been reported as well tolerated andelicited acceptable serological responses to vaccination in the dis-tal limbs. 57To facilitate 5 cm margins in the case of injection-site sarcoma, vaccinations must be administered in the distal tail, something that may not be practical for most clinicians. \u00b7Follow the 3-2-1 rule for postvaccination swelling.1,55Obtain incisional biopsies for appropriate diagnosis.The 2013 AAFP Feline Vaccination Advisory Panel Report in- cluded recommendations for speci c vaccine antigens to be ad- ministered at speci c anatomical locations in the distal limbs.1This technique has helped facilitate the identi cation of the vaccine an- tigen used if a sarcoma developed subsequently at the injection site.Since this technique has been widely adopted, these injection-siterecommendations have also led to a shift in the site of tumor for-mation to the distal limbs, thus facilitating potentially life-savingsurgery for patients suffering from these invasive tumors. 58The 2020 AAHA/AAFP Feline Vaccination Guidelines Task Force recognizes andsupports the value of the 2013 recommendations and recognizes thatpractitioners may, at times, need to use medically appropriate discre-tion regarding the anatomical location of vaccine administration.Practitioners are strongly advised to keep complete, accurate recordsfor antigen administration site and route of vaccine administration. The Task Force offers the following analysis of current research about vaccine safety: Experimental studies of vaccine-induced in flammation: These studies provide weak evidence for detecting differential vaccinationeffects on sarcoma incidence yet represent progenitors of the \"more vaccine-induced in flammation leads to increased sarcoma risk \" conjecture. One immediate problem is that it is unclear how todene in flammation in the context of tumor induction. Macy and Hendrick (1996) cite an unpublished study that de ned in flam- mation as \"the size of the local reaction. \" 59Grosenbaugh et al. (2004) interpreted it as the presence of \"injection-site reaction, \" which could have included \"scab, crust, swelling, erosion, ulcera- tion, or pain at the injection site or development of lameness. \"28Day et al. (2007) used histopathological scoring that included quanti-fying neutrophils, lymphocytes, broblasts, collagen, and granulation tissue (repair phase); and a \"global severity score \"based on biopsy site reactivity and extension of involvement of the tissue section. 60Because the many manifestations of in flam- mation in cats do not invariably lead to neoplasia, more sensitivebiomarkers such as DNA damage may one day be used to distin-guish the potential for adjuvanted versus non-adjuvanted vaccinesto induce tumors. 61But because none of the cats in the above studies developed sarcomas, such experimental research does nothave logical standing to infer relative vaccine safety. Associational studies of diagnoses: In the past 10 years, two studies based on data from pathology registries have provided contradictoryndings. Wilcock et al. (2012) found no decrease in the proportion of \"post-vaccinal sarcomas \"in feline skin and subcutaneous mass sub- missions from 1992 to 2010 in a Canadian registry despite the intro-duction of a non-adjuvanted rabies vaccine in 2000. 62In contrast, Graf et al. (2018) studied the proportion of feline biopsies that were FIGURE 1 Vaccination sites: Recommended injection sites in the distal limbs and tail.\u00aaiStock.com/GlobalP.2020 AAHA/AAFP Feline Vaccination Guidelines JAAHA.ORG 261brosarcomas submitted to Swiss pathology laboratories between 2009 and 2014 and noted \"am a r k e dd r o pi nt h er e l a t i v ef r e q u e n c yo f - brosarcoma diagnoses after the introduction of a non-adjuvanted FeLVvaccine into the Swiss market \"in 2007 (rabies vaccines are rarely used now in Switzerland). 29Such studies of diagnostic proportions are dif- cult to interpret. Moreover, they are in fluenced not only by disease incidence but also by factors related to differential cost and motivation for histopathologic diagnoses, which are subject to change over time.Therefore, there are always competing explanations for ndings. Longitudinal studies of comparative incidence: A study by Srivastav et al. (2012) is the only one to perform a comparative (case-control)analysis of vaccine types in common use in the past 10 years. 12Unlike previous epidemiologic studies, it provides tenuous evidence that non-adjuvanted vaccines may be less lik ely to induce sarcomas than adju- vanted vaccines. However, the work suffers from sample size limitationsand bias concerns. 30Although it arguably serves as an epidemiologic- methods blueprint for future investigations, it is insuf cient to justify a wholesale recommendation for a single vaccine formulation with as yetunforeseen consequences on population immunity. The Task Force believes that there is currently insuf cient research to justify recom- mending a single vaccine type. Since injection site sarcomas are a risk,the Task Force recommends vaccination in the lower distal limbs tofacilitate clean margins if surgical amputation is required. Frequently Asked Questions A summary of frequently asked questions is available online at aaha.org/felinevaccination and catvets.com/vaccination. Staff and Client Education The Veterinarian 's Role and Responsibilities \u00b7A veterinarian should assess every patient regardless of appoint- ment type (wellness, acute care or follow-up visit) for currentvaccination status based on age and lifestyle. Informed by thisassessment, an individualized patient vaccination plan shouldbe developed or modi ed and then discussed and agreed upon in collaboration with the cat owner. \u00b7In addition to overseeing the development of feline vaccinationprotocols, the veterinarian should provide staff education onthe following: o Zoonotic disease prevention.o Separate administration sites for each vaccination (based on consistent vaccination site guidelines for that practice). o Potential life-threatening adverse events (i.e., anaphylaxis) and minor adverse events (i.e., localized swelling) followingvaccination. o Vaccine reconstitution and handling (the AAFP recommends using vaccines within 30 minutes of reconstitution). 53o Standard sharps safety procedures to prevent accidental nee- dle sticks.63 The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) online training module, \"You Call the Shots: Vaccine Storage and Handling, \"is a useful resource for staff training on vaccination.64 T h ep r a c t i c es h o u l dd e s i g n a t eap e r s o nt ob et h ep r i m a r yv a c c i n e coordinator for the facility. This person will be responsible forensuring all vaccines are stored and handled correctly. A secondstaff member to serve as an alte rnate in the absence of the pri- mary coordinator should be appoin ted (this is particularly im- portant in case of after-hours emergencies). Both coordinatorsshould be fully trained in routi ne and emergency policies and procedures. 65 The healthcare team, led by the veterinarian, should emphasize and educate clients that they are part of a team approach to vaccinemanagement, requiring the entire staff 's understanding of zoonotic disease, core and non-core vaccines determined by the pet 's lifestyle, hospital policy, state law, client compliance, and adverse vaccinationevents. Credentialed Veterinary Technician or Veterinary Assistant Roles and Responsibilities A veterinary technician or assistant often assumes the role of des- ignated vaccine coordinator, assisting in vaccination storage andinventory management. AAHA guidelines on vaccine storage andhandling, and the CDC Vaccine Storage and Handling Toolkit areuseful resources for this purpose . 64,65The vaccine coordinator is often responsible for reconstitution of vaccines and administrationof vaccinations as directed by the attending veterinarian in com-pliance with state law. 66This individual is also often given respon- sibility for implementing feline-friendly handling techniques in thehospital setting to minimize stress during examinations and vaccineadministration 67and for maintaining effective client education and follow-up, including verbal and written instructions on potentialadverse events after vaccine administration and disease prevention. Roles and Responsibilities of Reception and Other Client-Service Personnel The reception staff is typically charged with maintaining patient les with vaccination information, including date administered, alongwith the production lot serial number and expiration date of thevaccine. Reception personnel are also responsible for contactingclients and scheduling follow-up appointments for booster series andyearly vaccinations in advance as directed by the prescribing veter-inarian. Non-clinical staff should understand the potential life-threatening and minor adverse events that can occur followingvaccination that require veterinary assistance. 262 JAAHA | 56:5 Sep/Oct 2020Client Education Pet owner clients are an essential member of a cat 's healthcare team. Although clients can be instrumental in helping improve healthcarefor their cats, the Task Force recommends that vaccination be performed by a veterinarian. Vaccination is a medical procedure. Vaccines are available through sources other than a veterinarian, butthey may not protect a cat against disease unless properly stored,handled, and administered. The principles of feline vaccinationoutlined in the box below represent a basic client education over-view for cat owners. To help educate clients about vaccine andgeneral health issues, both AAHA and the AAFP have handoutsavailable to members and non-members. Additionally, more ex-tensive information is available at aaha.org/felinevaccination andcatvets.com/vaccination. Summary Vaccination protocols for cats should consist of recommendedcore vaccines and discretionary non-core vaccines as de ned and listed in the guidelines. Vaccines in the latter category are givenbased on a risk-bene t assessment. Risk is determined by the patient 's life stage, lifestyle, clinical history, and health status and by environmental and epidemiologic risk factors. Althoughfeline vaccination is universally practiced by primary care com-panion animal practices, there is no single protocol suitable forall feline patients. Rather, vaccin ation of cats should be patient- speci c and guided by an individual risk-bene t assessment us- ing the criteria listed in the guidelines. In the case of somevaccines, practitioners have a choice of different types of anti-gens, including those that are inactivated, attenuated, and inrecombinant form. The patient 's clinical and vaccination status, such as the possible presence of m aternally derived immunity or a history of adverse postvaccination reactions, are factors thatmay in fluence the choice of vaccine type. Although most feline patients are household pets, practitioners should anticipate situations in which higher-risk cats are presentedfor vaccination, including those from shelter, cattery, feral, or fostercare origins. Adverse postvaccination reactions unavoidably occur ina small percentage of cats. Because of their neoplastic etiology, FISSscontinue to be the most serious, if infrequent, vaccine-associatedadverse event. Detection of patterns in FISS incidence remainselusive, and their occurrence continues to be idiosyncratic. Advisingclients in advance of the possibility of hypersensitivity or other re-actions will help minimize their concerns. All members of the practice team, including clinical and non-clinical personnel, should have a well-informed understanding of the importance of vaccinationof feline patients and be able to advise clients of the practice 's ap- proach to an individualized vaccination plan. The vaccination visit isan ideal time for a client education dialog in which the clinical staff Vaccination Talking Points for Clients Vaccines help protect against specic infectious diseases. They stimulate the body's immune system to recognize and ght an infection. Without vaccination, many cats would become seriously ill or die from preventable diseases. Some infections are more difcult to prevent using vaccination t han others. For example, vaccination is very effective against feline panleukopenia infection but does not entirely protect against respiratory virus infections. However, cats vaccinated against respiratory tract infections generally have milder illness and are far less likely to die from their disease. A veterinarian is the best person to evaluate a cat's individual vaccination needs. Many factors need to be taken into consideration when deciding how often and for what diseases a feline patient needs to be vaccinated. These considerations include health status, age, and lifestyle of the cat; avaccine's duration of immunity; what diseases are prevalent in the area; and the severity of endemic diseases. Even cats living exclusively indoorsrequire regular vaccination because they still may be exposed to diseases in many circumstances, such as when traveling or boarding, visiting aveterinary practice, interacting with other cats, or through viruses carried on the pet owner's hands or clothing. Veterinarian-administered vaccination is particularly important with respect to rabies. Rabies is a fatal but preventable disease that can be spre ad to humans by contact with saliva from an infected individual. If an unvaccinated cat is scratched or bitten by a wild animal, or if it bites a person, it shou ld be quarantined or euthanized. In many US states, it is against the law for anyone other than a licensed veterinarian to administer a rabies vaccine. Rabie s vaccination of cats is required by law in many but not all states. Ontario is the only Canadian province that requires rabies vaccination of cats. Even i n areas where it is not required, feline rabies vaccination is still recommended (i.e., it is a core vaccine). Severe vaccine reactions are rare. Veterinarians should convey the appropriate risk-benet analysis of any vaccination. Cats may experience mild, short-lived reactions (malaise) such as poor appetite, lethargy, and fever that will resolve without treatment. Clients should seek immediate vete rinary attention if their cat begins vomiting or scratching, develops bumps (hives) or facial swelling, or has difculty breathing within a few hours of bein g vaccinated. The client and veterinary practice team have the same goal: to provide the best possible care for the pet.2020 AAHA/AAFP Feline Vaccination Guidelines JAAHA.ORG 263has an opportunity to discuss the role of vaccination as an essential component of preventive healthcare tailored to the individual patient.
