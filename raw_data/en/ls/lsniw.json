Trial registration: PROSPERO: ( CRD42019148169 ) Keywords: Treatment duration, Clinical trials, Systematic review, Meta-analysi s Introduction Over the last several years, there has been an increase in the proportion of adults in orthodontic practices. This is due to the projected modern beauty standards, raised public awareness, increased treatment desire, novel tech- niques, and extensive direct-to-consumer advertising [ 1].However, orthodontic treatment of adult patients might considerably differ from the treatment of children and adolescents. In growing adolescents, many mal- occlusion traits are corrected by attempting to influence physiological growth with orthopedic appliances [ 2,3]. Adult patients do not exhibit growth potential, and they are thus treated with other protocols, which usually focus on dentoalveolar compensation [ 4].

Progress in Orthodontics (2020) 21:37 https://doi.org/10.1186/s40510-020-00334-4fact, orthodontic treatment might differ in expectations, duration, and obtained results in adult patients. Moreover, orthodontic tooth movement is a primarily biological process initiated by forces, which are trans- lated to biochemical signals, and it is mainly dependent on the physiology of mineralized and non-mineralized tissues [ 5]. Animal studies imply that biological differ- ences between adult and juvenile rats are apparent dur- ing orthodontic tooth movement. Lower initial rates of osteoclast differentiation, absence of a positive correl- ation between the rate of tooth movement and the num- ber of activated osteoclasts [ 6], significantly lower proliferation activity of the periodontal ligament cells in the initial phase of tooth movement [ 7], and a decreased bone turnover activity [ 8] have been reported in older rats. Although the initial phase of tooth movement ap- peared to be faster in juvenile than adult rats, tooth movement rates were similar once the linear phase was reached [ 6]. In human adults, inflammatory mediators of the gingival crevicular fluid were reported to be less re- sponsive in the initial phase of tooth movement [ 6] and yet higher levels of cytokine and osteoclast activity were coupled with slower tooth movement rates [ 9]. It is widely accepted that orthodontic treatment lasts for a long time; an average treatment with fixed appli- ances approximately lasts 24.9 months [ 10]. Considering that long-treatment times are a burden to the patients and are associated with various adverse effects [ 11,12], the ability to predict treatment duration and accordingly inform patients in advance is an essential skill for ortho- dontists [ 13] and lies in the interest of both orthodon- tists and patients. In that context, patients 'age might be an important factor in predicting treatment duration. Objective The present systematic review aims to critically compare the evidence derived from randomized and non- randomized clinical trials on the duration of treatment with fixed appliances between adolescents and adults. Materials and methods Protocol and registration This review 's protocol was made a priori, registered in PROSPERO (CRD42019148169), and all post hoc changes were appropriately noted (Appendix 1). This review is conducted and reported according to the Cochrane Hand- book [ 14] and PRISMA statement [ 15]. Eligibility criteria Clinical studies on human patients of any age, sex, ethni- city, or malocclusion were included, in which duration of orthodontic treatment with fixed appliances was com- pared between adolescent and adult patients (Appendix 2). Due to high inter-individual differences, the cut-offage of adulthood was arbitrarily chosen to be 18 years of age, unless otherwise noted in the included studies. No limitations concerning language, publication year, or sta- tus were applied. The primary outcome of this review was the duration of comprehensive orthodontic treat- ment in months from the insertion to the removal of fixed appliances. The secondary outcome was to assess the complete duration of any partial orthodontic treat- ments, like alignment of displaced canines or correction of deep-bites/cross-bites, if such treatments were reported. Information sources and search Eight electronic databases were systematically searched without any restrictions for publication date, type, and language from inception up to 28 September 2019 (Ap- pendix 3), while Directory of Open Access Journals, Digital Dissertations, metaRegister of Controlled Trials, WHO, and Google Scholar, as well as the reference lists of eligible articles or existing systematic reviews were manually searched for any additions. Study selection Two authors (AA, SNP) screened the titles and/or ab- stracts of studies retrieved from the searches to identify articles that potentially meet the inclusion criteria, be- fore moving to their full texts. Any differences between the two reviewers were resolved by discussion with a third author (VK). Data collection process and items Data collection from the identified reports was con- ducted using pre-defined and piloted forms covering (a) study characteristics (design, clinical setting, country), (b) patient characteristics (age, sex), (c) malocclusion characteristics, (d) appliance characteristics, and (e) number and type of extractions performed (if any). Data were extracted by two authors (AA, SNP) with the afore- mentioned way to resolve discrepancies. Risk of bias of individual studies The risk of bias of included randomized studies was assessed with the Cochrane Collaboration 's RoB 2.0 tool [16]. The risk of bias of included non-randomized studies was assessed with the ROBINS-I ( \"Risk Of Bias In Non- randomized Studies of Interventions \")[17]. Assessment of the risk of bias within individual trials was likewise inde- pendently performed by two authors (AA, SNP) and dis- crepancies were resolved by consulting a third author (VK). Data synthesis and summary measures An effort was made to include all existing trials in the analysis; where data were missing, they were calculatedAbbing et al. Progress in Orthodontics (2020) 21:37 Page 2 of 11by us. As duration of orthodontic treatment is bound to be affected by clinician-, appliance-, and patient-related characteristics, a random-effects model was deemed ap- propriate to calculate the average distribution of true ef- fects, based on clinical and statistical reasoning [ 18], and a restricted maximum likelihood random-effects model was used according to recent guidance [ 19]. Mean differ- ences (MDs) and their corresponding 95% confidence intervals (CIs) were calculated as effect sizes. The extent and impact of between-study heterogeneity was assessed by inspecting the forest plots and by calcu- lating the tau2(absolute heterogeneity) and the I2statis- tic (relative heterogeneity), respectively. I2defines the proportion of total variability explained by heterogeneity (not chance) in the results. An I2statistic over 75% was arbitrarily considered to represent considerable hetero- geneity, while also considering the heterogeneity 's direc- tion (localization on the forest plot) and uncertainty intervals around heterogeneity estimates [ 20]. Ninety- five percent predictive intervals, which are crucial for the correct interpretation of random-effects meta- analyses [ 21], were calculated for meta-analyses of 3 trials to incorporate existing heterogeneity and provide a range of possible effects for a future clinical setting. Additional analyses and risk of bias across studies Possible sources of heterogeneity were a priori planned to be sought through subgroup analyses and random- effects meta-regression in meta-analyses of at least five trials but could not be ultimately performed (Appendix 1). Likewise, reporting biases were planned, but they were not assessed due to the limited number of meta- analyzed trials. The overall quality of meta-evidence (i.e., the strength of clinical recommendations) was rated using the Grades of Recommendations, Assessment, Development, and Evaluation (GRADE) approach [ 22] following recent guidance on synthesizing non-randomized studies [ 23], and summary of findings tables were constructed using the improved format proposed by Carrasco-Labra et al. [24]. The minimal clinically important, large, and very large effects were defined as half, one, and two standard deviations of the response of the control (adolescents) group [ 25]. The produced forest plots were augmented with contours denoting the magnitude of the observed effects to assess heterogeneity, clinical relevance, and im- precision [ 26]. Robustness of the results was planned to be checked a priori with sensitivity analyses based on (a) inclusion/ex- clusion of non-randomized studies, (b) inclusion/exclu- sion of trials with methodological shortcomings, and (c) improvement of the GRADE classification. In the end, only one sensitivity analysis excluding non-randomizedstudies with methodological shortcomings could be con- ducted (Appendix 1). All the analyses were run in Stata version 14.0 (Stata- Corp LP, College Station, TX, USA) by one author (SNP) and the dataset is openly available [ 27]. All P values were two-sided with = 5%, except for the test of between-studies or between-subgroups heterogeneity, wherevalue was set at 10% [ 28]. Results Study selection The electronic literature search yielded 1718 results, while 4 studies were manually identified from the refer- ence list of the identified papers (Fig. 1). After duplicate removal and screening of titles/abstracts against the pre- defined eligibility criteria (Appendix 4), the full texts of 140 papers were checked. One study [ 29] was excluded post hoc, since it included only one adult patient, which made statistical comparisons between adolescents and adults patients difficult. Eventually, 11 papers pertaining to 11 unique studies (1 prospective and 10 retrospective non-randomized studies), which were published as jour- nal papers, were finally included (Table 1)[1,31-40]. Study characteristics The primary studies were conducted in university clinics (n= 4; 36%) origi- nated from seven different countries (Brazil, Germany, Italy, Malaysia, Nepal, South Korea, and the USA) (Table 1). A total of 2969 adolescents and 1380 adult patients were included with a median total sample of 59 patients per included study (range 18 to 2840 patients per study). Out of the 8 studies reporting on patient sex, 152 (33%) of the 457 patients in total were male, while the mean age for adolescents and adults was 13.1 and 26.7 years, respectively, in the 8 studies providing data. Nine of the included studies assessed comprehensive orthodontic treatment with fixed appliances, while one of them also included patients, whose treatment plan in- volved removable or functional appliances and orthog- nathic surgery [ 36]. One of the studies on comprehensive fixed appliance treatment compared conventional fixed appliances with the Suresmile appliances [ 39]. This com- parison falls outside this review 's scope and data for con- ventional appliances was therefore only included. The other two studies solely assessed either orthodontic align- ment of palatally displaced canines [ 34]o rr e t r a c t i o no f maxillary canines into premolar extraction spaces [ 35]. These are reported separately. As far as complexity of the treated cases is concerned, this was defined in the inclusion criteria of the primary studies in only three studies [ 1,33,37] and consisted of a minimum Class II molar relationship of a quarter (one study) or half cusp (two studies). As far as toothAbbing et al. Progress in Orthodontics (2020) 21:37 Page 3 of 11extractions are concerned, 4 studies (36%) did not report on extractions, 4 studies (36%) performed extractions on all patients, and 2 studies (18%) included both extraction and non-extraction cases. Risk of bias within studies The included non-randomized trials presented several is- sues that increased their risk for bias (Table 2). Even though all included non-randomized studies were prone to confounding and did not use any kind of matching, three studies (27%) were judged to be in moderate risk of bias for confounding, as they included patients with similar baseline severity and who were treated with simi- lar appliances. The remaining 8 studies (73%) either did not report on these confounders or had obvious baseline discrepancies. Five studies (45%) were in moderate or serious risk of bias for the selection of participants as they included either not representative cases of the aver- age patient or recruited patients being treated at differ- ent periods. All studies did not blind the outcome assessor and were judged to be in moderate risk of bias for outcome measurement, even though it is unclear how this might affect the reported results. Finally, allstudies were judged to be in low risk of bias for (a) clas- sification of interventions (exposure), (b) deviations from intended interventions, (c) missing data, and (d) selec- tion of the reported result. Data synthesis A total of 7 studies with 1150 patients comparing the duration of comprehensive treatment with fixed appli- ances among adolescents and adults were eligible for meta-analysis, the results of which indicated no statisti- cally significant difference (7 studies; MD = 0.8 months; 95% CI = 4.2 to 2.6 months; P= 0.65; Table 3). However, extreme heterogeneity was observed among studies both in absolute (tau2= 17.05) and relative terms (I2= 92%), which might render data synthesis problem- atic. Therefore, the most extreme study of Shim et al. [40] was excluded in order to achieve a homogeneous data synthesis. The results of this updated meta-analysis still indicated no difference in treatment duration be- tween adolescents and adults (6 studies; MD = 0.4 months; 95% CI = 0.7 to 1.4 months; P= 0.47; Fig. 2) with minimal absolute and relative (tau2= 0a n d I2= 0%).

However, alignment of palatally displaced canines lasted an average of 3.8 months longer in adultsTable 1. Characteristics of included studies.

Additional analyses, risk of bias across studies, and quality of evidence Several subgroup analyses, meta-regressions, and assess- ments for reporting biases were originally planned in the review 's protocol, but they could not be eventually per- formed due to limited data and inadequate reporting (Appendix 1). One subgroup analysis could be per- formed according to the inclusion of tooth extractions, where three studies consistently extracted teeth in all pa- tients (MD = 1.1 month; 95% CI = 0.4 to 2.6 months; P= 0.14) and three studies did not report at all on ex- tractions (MD = 0.3 months; 95% CI = 1.8 to 1.1 months; P= 0.66), with no significant between subgroup difference ( P= 0.25).The quality of evidence (Table 4) for the main meta- analysis of comprehensive treatment duration of six studies was very low, due to the inclusion of non- randomized studies with considerable risk of bias. The quality of evidence for the two meta-analyses on the duration of first upper molar distalization (1 study) and canine retraction (1 study) was low to very low, due to the inclusion of non-randomized studies and impreci- sion from limited analyzed samples. Finally, the quality of evidence of the meta-analysis that reported signifi- cantly longer alignment duration for palatally displaced canines in adult patients (1 study) was similarly very low due to bias and imprecision. Overall, the low to very low GRADE for all analyzed comparisons means that further research in terms of well-designed studies is very likely to have an important impact, which is likely to change our current estimates of effect.Table 3 Details of performed analyses Treatment CI)Pvalue of displaced canine Original 1 (30)3.79 (1.42, 6.16)0.002 -- - Distalization of 1st molar Original 1 (51)0.06 (1.66, 1.78)0.95 -- - Retraction of canine 4.53)0.12 -- - MDmean difference, CIconfidence interval aOriginal analysis gives a very heterogeneous picture, which is probably incompatible with synthesis of the studies; the sensitivity analysis probably gives a more stable image and should be preferred Fig. 2 Contour-enhanced forest plot for the duration of comprehensive treatment among adolescents and adult patients.

Progress in Orthodontics (2020) 21:37 Page 8 of 11Sensitivity analysis No sensitivity analysis could be performed by omitting non-randomized studies, as only non-randomized stud- ies were included. Sensitivity analysis according to the risk of bias by including only 2 of the 6 studies, which were in moderate risk of bias, still gave similar results (2 studies; MD = 1.1 months; 95% CI = 0.5 to 2.7 months; P= 0.18) to the original analysis. Discussion Results in context To our knowledge, this is the first study to systematically assess existing evidence on the duration of orthodontic treatment with fixed appliances in adult and adolescent patients. Eleven studies were finally included according to the review 's eligibility criteria and 7 (one prospective and six retrospective) with a total of 1150 patients were meta-analyzed. As far as the review 's main scope is concerned, meta- analysis of the seven included studies found no statistically significant difference in treatment duration between adults and adolescents ( P=0 . 6 5 ;T a b l e 3). Lower responsiveness to orthodontic forces as well as lower rates of tooth move- ment have been reported for adults compared to younger patients only with respect to the initial phase of tooth movement [ 40]. Moreover, it is important to note that all studies included here reported differences of very small magnitude (i.e., they were in the white portion of Fig. 2) and have probably limited clinical relevance. This might, therefore, indicate that any delays in tooth movement due to biological differences [ 6] might be counterbalanced by a potentially better compliance of adult patients inkeeping their appointments and adhering to the orthodon- tist's instructions, which have a direct effect on treatment duration [ 37]. On the other hand, the duration for the alignment of palatally displaced canines was significantly longer for adult patients compared to adolescents in one included study (MD = 3.8 months; Table 3). This is not in agree- ment with Stewart et al. [ 41], who found a positive associ- ation between young age and severity of displacement as well as longer treatment time. Yet, treatment of displaced canines presents considerable differences according to pa- tients 'characteristics, tooth localization, and treatment methods [ 42]. Besides, older patients also have signifi- cantly higher odds for ankylosis of the impacted canines once orthodontic traction has been applied to them [ 43]. Finally, no statistically significant difference was found in the duration of either distalization of the maxillary first molars with skeletal anchorage or the retraction of upper canines a fter premolar extraction. As far as distalization of the maxillary first molars is concerned, some studies have reported that it is more difficult in older patients when the second molars have already erupted [ 44], which could indicate that longer distalization times might be expected in adults. However, the protocol in the included study [ 36]u t i - lized forces in the upper third of the usual spectrum [45] in order to account for friction losses and forces were adapted constantly, which also provided ad- equate distalization for adults. Finally, as far as canine retraction is concerned, alt hough the single identified study [ 34] found no statistically significant difference in duration of retraction, considerably higher rootTable 4 Summary of findings table according to the GRADE approach Anticipated absolute effects (95% CI) Outcome Studies (patients)Adolescents Difference in adults Quality of the evidence (GRADE)bWhat happens with adults Full Tx duration 1010 patients (6 studies)30.1 monthsa0.4 months more (0.7 months less to 1.4 months more) very lowc due to biasLittle to no difference in overall treatment duration Duration of PDC alignment 30 patients (1 study)3.0 months 3.8 months more (1.4 to 6.2 months more) very lowc,d due to bias, imprecisionMight be associated with longer alignment of PDCs Duration of 1stmolar distalization 51 patients (1 study)7.4 months 0.1 month more (1.7 months less to 1.8 months more)very lowd,e due to bias, imprecisionLittle to no difference in duration of 1st molar distalization Duration of canine retraction 18 patients (1 study)4.0 months 2.0 months more (0.5 month less to 4.5 months more) very lowc,d due to bias, imprecisionLittle to no difference in duration of canine retraction Intervention: comprehensive orthodontic treatment with fixed appliances/population: adolescents or adult patients with any kind of malocclusion/setting: university clinics, private practices (Brazil, Germany, Italy, Malaysia, Nepal, South Korea, USA) CIconfidence interval, GRADE Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development and Evaluation, Txtreatment, PDC palatally displaced canine, momonth aResponse in the control group is based on random-effects meta-analysis of the adolescent groups of included studies bStarts from \"high \" cDowngraded by two to three levels for bias due to the inclusion of non-randomized studies with serious risk of bias dDowngraded by one level for imprecision due to the inclusion of an inadequate sample eDowngraded by one level for bias due to the inclusion of non-randomized studies with moderate risk of biasAbbing et al. Progress in Orthodontics (2020) 21:37 Page 9 of 11resorption for adult patients was reported, which is corroborated by previous data [ 46] and might indicate underlying differences in the physiology of tooth movement and the tissue response [ 47]. Strengths and limitations This systematic review has several strengths, comprising an a priori registered protocol [ 48], a comprehensive lit- erature search, the use of modern analytic methods [ 19], the application of the GRADE approach to assess the strength of provided recommendations [ 22], and the transparent availability of all data [ 27]. However, some limitations do also exist at the same time. Firstly, methodological issues existed for all in- cluded studies that might influence results and that is especially the case for included retrospective non- randomized studies [ 49]. Inclusion of non-randomized studies in meta-analyses is not considered prohibitory, provided that robust bias appraisal has been per- formed and recent guidance has been provided on how to appropriately incorporate such designs [ 23]. Secondly, most meta-analyses were predominantly based on small trials, which might affect the precision of the estimates [ 50]. Thirdly, the small number of trials included in meta-analyses and their incomplete reporting of results and potential confounders, such as case severity, different cut-off ages for adulthood, treatment appliances/techniques, and treatment out- come quality, precluded from conducting many sub- group analyses and meta-regressions, which could enable identification of treatments that might take longer in adult patients. Finally, a potential overlap of age groups might exist at some point in-treatment due to the length of the comprehensive treatment, al- though mean ages for included adolescents and adults were 13.1 and 26.7 years, respectively. Conclusions Based on available evidence from mostly retrospective non-randomized studies assessing adult and adolescent patients, no statistically and clinically significant differ- ence in the duration of comprehensive orthodontic treatment with fixed appliances was found. However, existing studies on the topic have serious methodological limitations and future studies with transparent reporting of treatment procedures, objective outcome assessment, and adequate handling of confounders are needed to ro- bustly tackle this topic.

Deviations from the protocol Several factors were planned to be assessed through s ubgroup analyses/meta -regressions in meta - analyses of at least 5 studies, but they could not be ultimately conducted due to limited material/reporting: (i) subsets according to the pat ient sample charact (age, malocclusion type, malocclusion severity, configuration); ( ii) subsets according to any additional appliances/adjuncts used in treatment; ( iii) the operator's experience with each system. Additionally, sensitivity analyses regarding i) inclusion/exclusion of non -randomiz ed studies and (ii) improvement of the GRADE classification were not performed. 2 Appendix 2.
