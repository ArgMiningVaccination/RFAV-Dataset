INTRODUCTION Community-acquired pneumonia (CAP) is the most common cause of death in children worldwide, accounting for 15% of deaths in children younger than 5 years of age. (1) Nearly 1 in 500 children will be hospitalized for CAP, which creates asubstantial economic burden. CAP is thus important to diagnose and appro- priately treat. While viral causes of CAP are most common, differentiating viral versus bacterial etiologies can be dif cult. This leads to excessive use of antimicrobial medications or susceptibility to feeling a pressure to prescribe. (2)Overall, in the United States, 11.4 million antimicrobial prescriptions for pedi- atric respiratory tract infections per year are avoidable. (3) Furthermore, broad- spectrum but less effective antimicrobial agents are often prescribed when pharmacokinetically favorable narrow-spectrum agents are available. (4) Argu- ably, the untoward effects of overtreatment of CAP in those in whom treatment isunwarranted compounds the morbidity of this disease process. Because of mounting knowledge of antimicrobial side effects, resistance, and microbiome effects, practitioners must adhere to the principles of judicious use when treating CAP. In this regard, CAP, its epidemiology, various etiologic origins, clinicalAUTHOR DISCLOSURE Drs Messinger, Kupfer, Hurst, and Parker have disclosed no nancial relationships relevant to this article.

(6) The intent of this review is to supplement this excellent work by focusing on specic treatment once a provider has weighed the risks and benets and decided that a child 's condition warrants treat- ment of bacterial CAP and management of its complica- tions. Salient details from both sources are summarized throughout. REVIEW OF INITIAL DIAGNOSIS No standard of reference for diagnosis or single de nition of pneumonia exists. In this review, CAP is de ned as an acute lower respiratory tract infection acquired in a previ-ously healthy individual. Associated symptoms include fever, cough, dyspnea, and tachypnea with supporting evidence of parenchymal infection and in flammation, diagnosed ac- cording to ndings at chest auscultation or the presence of focal opacity seen on chest radiographs. (5)(7) Focal opacity on chest radiographs is often held as a standard of reference; however, some viral processes and atelectasiscan cause focal radiographic ndings (though atelectasis traditionally resolves in 48- 72 hours). In addition, ndings on radiographs can lag behind clinical symptoms. Viral pneumonitis accounts for most respiratory infections, particularly in children younger than 5 years of age. Unfor- tunately, no constellation of clinical symptoms or signs (fever, tachypnea, hypoxemia, work of breathing) displays good speci city or sensitivity for radiographic ndings of pneumonia, except that symptom severity and ill appear-ance do correlate with focal in ltrates. To exclude pneumo- nia, investigators in 1 study assessed the absence of cough, crackles (rales), rhonchi, retractions, and nasal flaring in young infants and found it useful in its negative predictivevalue; but again, the presence of these ndings was insen- sitive in the prediction of pneumonia at radiography. (8) Leftwith few alternatives, pediatricians typically use a combina- tion of radiographic and physical ndings to decide to treat a patient for bacterial disease. Decisions on whether to hospi-talize a patient are made by weighing the criteria presented in Table 1, which were adapted from national guidelines andprior review articles. (5)(6) When to perform imaging in cases of acute pneumonia is not well delineated, although some rules of thumb apply. Chest radiographs are indicated in patients with more severe respiratory distress, particularly those who meet criteria for hospitalization. This imaging modality is used to assess the presence of focal parenchymal opacities, as well as screening for the presence of complications such aseffusion or empyema in patients who have not responded to antibiotic treatment. Per Infectious Disease Society of Amer-ica guidelines, other indications for chest radiography include inconclusive clinical ndings and ruling out other possible causes of respiratory distress that can be diagnosed at radiog- raphy (foreign body, pneumothorax, pleural disease, or cardiac disease, including pulmonary edema and cardiomegaly). Imag- ing is also indicated in febrile infants without a source who are younger than 12 months of age, if there is evidence of leuko- cytosis. Conversely, in patients with mild evidence of lower respiratory tract infection (fever, cough) without hypoxemia or a focal lung examination who are st able for outpatient treatment, radiographs of the chest are not typically indicated. (9)(10) Laboratory examinations are considered for all patients ill enough to be hospitalized with suspected bacterial pneumo- nia. These may commonly include blood cultures, in flamma- tory markers, complete blood cell count, and nasopharyngealswab polymerase chain reaction (PCR) for viruses. Blood cul- tures rarely yield positive ndings in CAP, and they should not be performed in patients treated on an outpatient basis or inhospitalized patients with uncomplicated disease. However, in patients with severe disease, the 10% to 18% yield isarguably worthwhile. (11) In flammatory markers (erythrocyte sedimentation rate, C-reactive protein level, or procalcitonin)may aid in clinical decision-making if measured longitudi- nally, particularly in those with complicated CAP (discussed later). (12) The complete blood cell count may provide infor- mation on further complications, such as thrombocytopenia or anemia from hemolytic uremic syndrome. (6) Nasopha- ryngeal swabs for viral PCR should only be performed if the results will change management. The number and types of examinations performed depends on the severity and trajec- tory of the illness. Athorough history may lead one to consider t esting for other unusual causes of lobar pneumonia. These causes and their historical cues are listed in Table 2. In the remainder of this review, it is assumed that a prac- titioner has weighed the clinical, radiologic, and laboratoryevidence for their patient as discussed earlier, reviewed national guidelines, and made a judicious decision to treat bacterial causes of CAP. With this context in mind, we will discuss pathogenesis, outpatient and inpatient management with re- spect to routine and novel diagno stics, antimicrobial choices and length of therapy, diagnosis and management of com- plications, and recurrent lobar pneumonia and special CAP considerations for patients w ith neuromuscular disease. PATHOGENESIS AND BASIC DEFINITIONS Pneumonia occurs as result of invasion of the lower respi- ratory tract by a pathogenic organism. Bacterial infection Vol. 38 No. 9 SEPTEMBER 2017 395 by guest on November 14, 2018 http://pedsinreview.aappublications.org/ Downloaded from represents a failure of many layers of extrinsic and intrinsic defense. Physical barriers to infection include upper respi- ratory tract nasal hairs and turbinate architecture, as well as complex respiratory airway branching that inhibits access to distal airways. In the large airways, cough and mucociliary clearance of secretions and humoral and cell-mediated defenses work to defend the lower respiratory tract frominvasion. Secreted and humoral immunoglobulins, as well as intrinsic antimicrobial of alveolar fluid, work with the phagocytic alveolar macrophages to eradicate bacteria.When these defenses are overwhelmed in some capacity, bacterial pathogens penetrate and cause disease. (13) Many factors may contribute to overwhelming of these defenses and subsequent pneumonia, but the in fluence of TABLE 1.

Animal models suggest that respiratory viruses destroy the respiratory epithelium and change the landscape of the cell surface to exhibit more antigen receptors. These changes impair the cough re flex and mucociliary clearance. In addition, viruses may inhibit normal macrophage func-tion. In fluenza is most commonly associated with subse- quent bacterial superinfection, but suspicion for this entity should be high in any child with a viral prodrome who exhibits abrupt worsening of clinical status in a time frame in which a viral infection should be resolving. (14) A public health example of this viral-bacterial interplay is readily avail- able, in that pneumococcal vaccines decrease the morbidity of influenza infections, while some viral vaccines decrease the incidence of radiographic ndings of pneumonia. (15) Bacterial pneumonia can be classi ed according to sev- eral pathophysiological de nitions based primarily on radio- logic and physical ndings. Lobar pneumonia involves a single discrete lobe or lung segment of parenchymal in flam- mation, a discrete opacity on chest radiographs, bronchial breath sounds, and classic pattern is typicalof pneumococcal infection. Bronchopneumonia involves inflammation of the airways and interstitium and appears more diffuse on images, with scattered crackles, rhonchi,and asymmetrical disease with focal parenchymal in flammation is observed in cases of viral pneumonia that become subsequently bacterial (in patientswith in fluenza, for example). Cavitary pneumonia is a result of tissue necrosis associated with Mycobacterium tuberculo- sis, although it can occur with other pathogens. (13) Com- plicated pneumonia includes identi cation of bacterial etiologic origins in CAP is limited by lack of a primary sample for culture or PCRfrom the lower respiratory tract. This in turn limits ourability to describe with con dence the microbial and epi- demiological patterns of bacterial pneumonia. That said,bacterial causes of CAP continue to include Streptococcus pneumoniae ,S aureus , and S pyogenes. Overall, with the advent of S pneumoniae vaccines, the incidence of unequiv- ocal bacterial CAP is decreasing, although of those whodevelop CAP, S pneumoniae remains the most common cause. Multiple studies in which antigen detection andnucleic acid PCR were used on culture-negative empyemasdemonstrated empyemas are caused by penicillin-susceptible, nonvaccine serotypes of Sp n e u m o n i a e . (13)(16)(17) For S aureus , there is some evidence that pediatric lung infections from methicillin-resistant S aureus (MRSA) are increasing. (18)(19)(20) Because of immunization, herd immunity, and partialimmune responses to even 1 dose of vaccine, invasive disease due to Haemophilus in fluenzae type B is now exceed- ingly uncommon. Nontypeable Hi n fluenzae strains are now responsible for most cases of invasive Haemophilus dis- ease, including pneumonia. (21) Between 2003 and 2012, the annual incidence of invasive, nontypeable Hi nfluenzae disease was 1.6 cases per 100,000 children younger than 5years of age. Invasive disease with Moraxella catarrhalis is similar. Studies on the evaluation of the role of theseorganisms are marred by easy contamination from the upper airway, and results are dif cult to interpret. It is likely TABLE 2.

Timing of positive serologic ndings varies, and some diseases require acute and convalescent sera. Some organisms require speci c culture conditions.

Mycoplasma undoubtedly causes CAP and can cause lobar disease and effusions, although the role oftreatment remains controversial (as discussed later). A list of less usual causes for pneumonia and when to consider them is presented in Table 2. Inexpensive, reliable, noninvasive methods for establish- ing a bacterial etiologic origin in pediatric pneumonia are highly desirable to promote selection of the most narrow and effective antimicrobial treatment. Options for pathogen discovery include upper and lower airway samples, coupled with traditional culture methods, targeted PCR, and targetedrelative quantitative PCR (although these PCR methods are not yet available except in research settings). Upper-airway samples include nasopharyngeal washes and swabs and throat samples. These samples are useful in the detection of various bacteria, including Mycoplasma pneumoniae ,Chlamydophila pneumoniae, is com- monly used in adults but has been a challenge in pediatrics.In theory, sputum includes a lower airway sample. Sputumsamples are informative in adults and have been studied with success in children as young as 1 month of age. (22) Coordination with a respiratory therapist to use specialized techniques to improve sputum expectoration and/or nasal aspiration may be required in children younger than 6 years of age to obtain a successful, high-quality specimen (fewer than 10 squamous epithelial cells per low-power eld). While sputum collection is not necessary for evaluationin a patient treated on an outpatient basis, attempts should be made to obtain sputum in children with moderate to severe pneumonia who are hospitalized. (6) Low-qualitysputum specimens are not meaningful, can be misleading, and should not be cultured. (13)(23) Studies of PCR of sputum and upper-airway samples are plagued by the bias of pretreatment and lack of comparison to the lower airway. In theory, these are improved by using quantitative PCR but are still problematic and are not yet readily available. (24) Sampling techniques for the lower respiratory tract in- clude direct pleural sampling, pleural fluid aspiration after placement of a chest tube or video-assisted thorascopic surgery (VATS), bronchoalveolar lavage via flexible performed) direct biopsy of the paren-chyma or open thoracotomy. Sampling of pleural fluid without placement of a chest tube (thoracentesis) is the most direct way of obtaining more information but has become unfamiliar for many practi- tioners. For a period of time, it was believed that identifying the microorganism did not change the treatment, and amidconcerns about surgical complications such as pneumotho- rax, bleeding, and pain, the practice has become much lesscommon. In the current era of antimicrobial resistance, this should be reconsidered. Ideally, sampling should occur before treatment with antibiotics. Procedural instructions for thora- centesis and recommendations for radiologic assistance are available. (25) Commonly, pleural flu i di so b t a i n e dw i t h therapeutic procedures such as chest tube placement or VATS,which almost always occur after some period of antimicrobial therapy, often resulting in negative culture ndings. When pleural fluid is obtained, it should be sent for Gram stain and bacterial culture, as well as cell count and differential, to allow differentiation of bacteria from othercauses of effusion (ie, mycobacterial, oncologic). Modi ed criteria, originally proposed by Light et al, (26) in 1972, allowdifferentiation of exudate from transudate on the basis of fluid pH level, presence of leukocytes, protein, glucose, and lactate dehydrogenase ratios. However, international guide-lines do not recommend these tests because they rarely change management in pediatric cases with a high pretest probability of bacterial pneumonia. Culture of the fluid is crucial; however, if the patient is pretreated, 70% of ndings are negative. (10) S pneumoniae is a particularly dif cult bacterium to culture because of its propensity for autolysis and relative fragility during sample transport. (27) Other cultures should be based on unusual exposure history or clinical situations (Table 2). Efforts to better characterize the bacterial components of pleural fluid with culture-independent methods are under- way. Many studies focus on identi cation of S in culture-negative pleural ca- tion. Antigen testing and PCR testing of pleural fluid greatly increase diagnostic yield, although these are not yet readily available. (15) A study in which uniplex PCR was used in pleural fluid demonstrated a causative organism in 82% of 56 children. (28) In addition to targeted PCR, relativequantitation of PCR, PCR for the gene-encoding bacterial RNA subunit, and deep sequencing are all up-and-coming techniques. (29) Urinary antigen tests for S pneumoniae are not recommended for children because of the high rate of false-positive results. (6) In patients receiving mechanical ventilation, 2 additional options exist for obtaining lower respiratory tract specimens: bronchoscopy and tracheal aspirate. Tracheal aspirates are likely of similar utility to sputum and are most useful if obtained early, prior to colonization of the endotracheal tube with pa- tient or hospital flora. The use of bronchoscopy to obtain a bronchoalveolar lavage sample is an option if other sources ofmicrobial diagnosis cannot be o btained and should be partic- ularly considered in complica ted and/or immunosuppressed Vol. 38 No. 9 SEPTEMBER 2017 399 by guest on November 14, 2018 http://pedsinreview.aappublications.org/ Downloaded from hosts who may have unusual pathogens or in children who are not improving despite receiving adequate therapy for usualpathogens. In pediatrics, nonbronchoscopic bronchoalveolar lavage or mini -bronchoalveolar lavage has been studied for safety in older children (30) wit h ventilator-associated pneu- monia but is not commonly used because of the size of the pediatric airway. (31) OUTPATIENT MANAGEMENT Uncomplicated bacterial pneumonia is an entity that can be effectively treated in most children on an outpatient basis with oral antibiotics and supportive care. Cough and feverare often present in any patient in whom pneumonia is being considered, but the degree of respiratory distress is important to assess for each patient. (32) For management of outpatient mild to moderate bacterial pneumonia, treatment with antibiotics is empirical; it is not recommended to pursue tests to assess for a cause if the patient does not meet criteria for inpatient treatment. Cri- teria for hospitalization include hypoxemia, moderate respi- ratory distress, age younger than 12 months, and presence ofa moderate to large pleural effusion, in addition to the criteria in Table 1. (5)(6) A child who meets the criteria for outpatient management will thus be relatively well and amenable to oral therapy but at risk for progression; thus, close follow-up is warranted. A key to success in the outpatient realm is an appropriate choice and dose of an antimicrobial agent. Selection of appropriate oral antibiotics is based on assessment of pre- sumed pathogens, patient age, exposures, prior medical history, medication allergies, and community bacterial resis- tance patterns. The key organism to cover in this setting isS pneumoniae because it remains the most common cause, despite vaccination. (15) The cornerstone of oral antimicro-bial treatment for S pneumoniae is amoxicillin. Practitioners commonly presume that oral cephalosporins are superior toamoxicillin for S pneumoniae ; this likely stems from knowl- edge that some S pneumoniae penicillin nonsusceptible isolates are susceptible to ceftriaxone and assume that oral cephalosporins are superior to amoxicillin. Indeed, the op- posite is true. Oral cephalosporins have short half-lives, arepoorly absorbed, are highly protein bound, and are often dosed at long intervals. This results in serum concentrations that do not provide enough killing time (serum concentra- tion over minimum inhibitory concentration [MIC]) to treat, except for organisms with a low MIC to a selected drug. Amoxicillin reaches higher levels and is less protein bound, thus giving it more time with a drug concentration over the MIC for many pathogens, provided the MIC is in thesusceptible or intermediate drug level range. Because the pharmacokinetics of the oral cephalosporins are far inferiorto amoxicillin, their use in CAP should be reserved for patients who are allergic to penicillin or patients with a cause known to be resistant to amoxicillin but susceptible to cephalosporins (ie, M catarrhalis orb-lactamase -positive b-lactam anti- biotics is the dosing interval. Many practitioners are un-aware that more frequent dosing will provide more killing time and have the potential to treat organisms with slightly higher MICs. For example, for S pneumoniae with a peni- cillin MIC of 2.0 mg/mL, 90 mg per kilogram of body weight divided into doses administered twice daily will achieve curein approximately 65% of patients, while if divided into doses administered 3 times daily, it is estimated to provide cure in 90%. (34) Thus, when amoxicillin is used, pharmacoki- netics are superior if used in high doses (90- 100 mg/kg per day) divided into doses administered 3 times a day, insteadof twice daily. This dosing strategy should be selected where higher rates of nonsusceptible S pneumoniae exist or argu- ably in all patients with lobar CAP in whom room for error with outpatient treatment should be minimized. (35) Al- though twice-daily dosing is successful in otitis media because of the prolonged half-life of the drug in the ear fluid (and thus creating more time with a drug level over the MIC of the offending organism) when compared to serum(4 vs 1.2 hours, respectively), this cannot be safely extrap- olated to true bacterial pneumonia. (36) Although empirical coverage of Hi n fluenzae and M catarrhalis is not warranted in most patients, it is important to note that 30% of Hi nfluenzae and 100% of M catarrhalis produce a b-lactamase, rendering those isolates resistant to amoxicillin. They are routinely susceptible to amoxicillin - clavulanic acid and cephalosporins. Other microbial causesof CAP include S aureus and S pyogenes, although these bacteria do not usually cause disease mild enough to betreated in an outpatient setting. Oral antimicrobial selec- tions are discussed in Fig 1. M pneumoniae is known to cause diffuse or lobar CAP, but the bene ts of treatment remain controversial. (37)(38) The ability of a practitioner to differentiate Mycoplasma from other etiologic origins by using clinical history and exam-ination ndings is not reliable and can lead to overtreatment of this pathogen. Although national guidelines recommendconsideration of treatment in patients older than 5 years of age, (6) this may lead to undue pressure to treat, given the lack of proven bene t. The judicious practitioner should be allowed room to align with national reviews (38) and notroutinely treat this entity empirically, particularly if symptoms 400 Pediatrics in Review by guest on November 14, 2018 http://pedsinreview.aappublications.org/ Downloaded from are also consistent with viral disease or if providers are already treating the patient for other bacterial causes. In adult popula- tions, the desire to cover both Mycoplasma and bacterial causes has led to a crisis in the overuse of fluoroquinolones, a practice the Food and Drug Administration has strongly discouraged.(39) Though azithromycin is largely ineffective against the traditional CAP pathogens mentioned earlier, it is often used in an attempt to treat both typical and atypical infections, which contributes to the fact that it is the second most commonly prescribed antimicrobial agent in outpatient pediatrics. (40) Despite a recent publication in which investigators suggest that azithromycin may decrease subsequent wheezing when used in early childhood, (41) the dif c u l t i e so ft h i sr e s e a r c hm a k et h e results inconclusive, and any potential bene tm u s tb ew e i g h e d against the need for dual therapy , side effects, development of resistance, and detrimental effects on the microbiome. (42)(43)Many centers now have rapid diagnostics to target Mp n e u m o - niae, so treatment might logically be reserved for hospitalized patients with positive PCR test ndings. Length of therapy for uncomplicated bacterial CAP should not exceed 7 days, and there are data to support 3 days for nonsevere CAP. (44) Studies have demonstrated similar success rates of 7 days when compared with 10 days and 5 days. (45)(46) Although all studies involving CAP are subject to the Pollyanna phenomenon (positivity bias), (47) the number and consistency of the shorter therapy studies increase the quality of the evidence such that the benets (in terms of mitigating resistance, decreased side effects, and compliance) of 5 or 7 days should make these lengths standard. A patient is considered to have failed outpatient antimi- crobial therapy for CAP when clinical worsening occurs,Figure 1. Complicated CAP empirical antibiotic therapy algorithm.

Notably, fever may persist (for an average of 48hours), (48) but if a patient is improving in other ways (better oral intake, lower respiratory rate, increased normal activities), this would not be deemed a failure. If failure occurs, repeat chest radiography and consideration of hos- pitalization are in order. If the patient is hospitalized, it is not necessary to expand coverage unless resistant organisms are suspected (ie, rapid progression suggestive of S aureus orS pyogenes ), since intravenous (IV) ampicillin reaches much higher serum levels than amoxicillin and provides extended killing time for S pneumoniae . One may suspect highly resistant S pneumoniae in children who have not received the pneumococcal conjugate PCV13, INPATIENT MANAGEMENT Inpatient management of CAP can be separated into 2 patient scenarios: those who are admitted with viral pneu- monitis and who might have superimposed CAP and those with a clear need-to-treat bacterial CAP, with or without aparapneumonic process. For the rst category, the discus- sion of diagnosis, outpatient management, and hospitaliza-tion criteria in Table 1 was addressed earlier. For those with an undisputed need-to-treat bacterial CAP as the primary diagnosis, a few management principles apply. These in- clude diligence in solidifying a microbial diagnosis, thought- ful antimicrobial therapy, and management of complicated disease. Although inpatient bacterial CAP is still most likely to be S pneumoniae , other causes should be considered in certain inpatient settings. S aureus should be particularly consid- ered in patients with in fluenza and superimposed CAP. S aureus and S pyogenes should be considered in those with rapidly progressive disease or signs and/or symptoms ofsepsis or toxic shock. While ampicillin provides adequate coverage of S pyogenes , coverage for inpatients may need to be expanded for S aureus with consideration of MRSA coverage, depending on severity of disease and local resis- tance patterns. The need to cover Hi nfluenzae orM catar- rhalis specically in the inpatient setting in normal hosts is debatable, and hospitals that choose to prioritize the use ofampicillin and/or amoxicillin (which lack coverage for 30% ofHi n fluenzae and all M catarrhalis ) demonstrate similar outcomes when compared to the historical use of more ex-panded regimens. (49) Sp n e u m o n i a e ,Sa u r e u s , andSp y o g e n e s can all cause parapneumonic processes. For antibiotic treat-ment guidelines for inpatient CAP, please see Fig 1 on antibiotic choice (IV and oral step-down).Studies support the use of standardized inpatient CAP guidelines. Per the Centers for Disease Control and Pre- vention Study of Etiology of Pneumonia in the Community on pneumonia causes, the use of inpatient clinical care guidelines improved the use of ampicillin and decreased use of cephalosporins and macrolides without negatively affect- ing outcomes. (50) In this study, investigators also looked at combined clinical physiological parameters (respiratory rate, oxygen saturation) for \"time to clinical stability \"and re- ported that guidelines were also helpful in determiningtiming of discharge. (51) Given that moderate to severe CAP involves bacteria- triggered in flammation, investigations into adjunctive anti- inflammatory therapies included macrolides and corticosteroids. Adjunctive corticosteroid use is supportedin adults with severe CAP, with studies showing shorter time to clinical stability, shorter hospital lengths of stay, and possible decreased mortality. There were no clinically sig- nicant side effects identi ed in relation to corticosteroids in these patients. (52)(53) The use of corticosteroids has notyet been studied in pediatric CAP and should thus be approached with caution. A short steroid course (5 -7 days) should be strongly considered in patients with CAP who received a diagnosis of asthma if they exhibit signs of reversible airway obstruction. Use of azithromycin as an anti-in flammatory agent in acute CAP remains controver- sial and is not recommended at this time. (54)(55) COMPLICATED PNEUMONIA There is substantial variability in admission rates for children seen in the emergency department for CAP independent of illness severity, and there is little to help clinicians predictwhich patients will go on to develop moderate to severe com- plications. In a recent study in Pediatrics, in which the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention Study of Etiology ofPneumonia in the Community data were also used, predictive analytics were used to develop 3 prognostic models to esti- mate risk for severe pneumonia outcomes in children. A simple electronic health record model in which 9 predictors were aggregated, including data on age, race, temperature, vital signs, and partial pressure of arterial oxygen to fractionalindex of oxygen ratio, was used to accurately identify risk for intensive care unit admission and severe outcomes, including the need for invasive mechanical ventilation and death. This work, despite requiring more validation, may provide an important tool for clinicians in determining those at highest risk for complications from CAP. (56) Despite decreasing incidence of bacterial pneumonia and invasive pneumococcal disease attributed to vaccination 402 Pediatrics in Review by guest on November 14, 2018 http://pedsinreview.aappublications.org/ Downloaded from against Hi nfluenzae andS pneumoniae , studies indicate that the rate of empyema and other complications of bacterial CAP are increasing, particularly in preschool-aged patients. (18)(57) This is possibly due to pneumococcal serotype replacement and/or antibiotic resistance. (58) Complications of effusion, empyema, pulmo- nary abscess, bronchopleural stula, or impending respiratory failure, and sepsis. Pleaserefer to Fig 2 for radiographic examples of some of these complications. Parapneumonic effusion refers to an exuda- tive process that results in a pleural fluid collection due to pneumonia. Parapneumonic effusions develop in stages on the basis of duration. In the rst several days, effusions are exudative and free flowing. By the second week, they become bropurulent with brin deposition over the pleurae. Fluid can become septated. By 10 to 14 days, the effusion becomes organized, with a stiff pleural membrane. Empyema is a purulent effusion, with leukocytosis and/or bacteria in the pleural space. Effusions are categorized by size to aid in clinical decision-making (Fig 3). A bronchopleural stula occurs when an erosion in the airway or parenchyma com-municates directly with the pleura, such that air enters thepleural space. Necrotizing pneumonia occurs as a compli- cation of both lobar and bronchopneumonia and is de ned by a combination of parapneumonic effusion, loculation,and septation of the effusion and abscesses. These patientshave a combination of the ndings discussed earlier, exhibit diminished or absent aeration and crackles at auscultation, and typically appear ill and even toxic, with high fevers, hypoxemia, and malaise. Complicated CAP should be sus- pected in cases of previously healthy children with pro- longed and persistent fever or deteriorating clinical status, despite receiving appropriate antibiotic treatment. Other clinical scenarios \u2014such as rapid progression to impending or fulminant respiratory failure \u2014or the presence of chronic comorbid illness \u2014such as immunode ciency, chronic lung disease, or anatomic abnormalities \u2014should prompt earlier consideration and evaluation with imaging and laboratory diagnostics. Indications for chest computed tomography (CT) in complicated CAP include concern pa-renchymal abnormality. Identi or empyema is notreliable and does not correlate with outcomes of speci c interventions (ie, chest tube drainage, intrapleural brino- lytics, or VATS). Therefore, chest CT is not indicated on a routine basis for evaluation of mild to moderate pneumonia or even in cases of simple pleural effusion. When indicated,CT should be performed with IV contrast material to allow differentiation of thoracic structures. The utility of lung ultrasonography in diagnosing com- plicated pneumonia is controversial, in both the literature and clinical practice. Lung ultrasonography in combination with initial chest radiography can demonstrate small pneumonic consolidations and allow early diagnosis of pleural effusion. (59) Evaluation of pleural effusion with chest ultrasonography (a)allow localization, (b)demonstrate the loculations or septations to further characterize empyema,and/or (c)guide thoracentesis and drain placement. However, th e presence or absence of septations on ultrasonography does not enable prediction of a response to speci ct h e r a p i e so r indicate a need for surgical intervention over medical manage- ment. Ultrasonography is highly user dependent, and images should be acquired and interpreted by experienced personnel. Management of parapneumonic effusions may be solely medical or may involve a range of procedures to drain fluid and physically disrupt brosis and in flammation. The deci- sion of type and timing for percutaneous drainage or surgicalintervention often depends on local expertise and the indi- vidual clinical scenario. Long-term outcomes of children with pleural empyema are good, regardless of the treatment ap- proach used during the acute phase of illness, (58) although drainage procedures that meet the criteria as outlined in national recommendations may shorten hospital stays. (13) An example of an algorithm based on these guidelines is provided in Fig 3 and is used at our institution. The goal of Figure 2. Radiologic progression of complicated pneumonia. A.

Criteria for surgical intervention in cases of parapneu- monic effusion and empyema involve consideration of the size and duration of the effusion on images and the degree of respiratory compromise and illness severity. Patients with clinically signi cant hypoxemia, hypercapnia, and positive pressure requirements or with complete respiratory failurethat requires intubation and ventilation will likely bene t from drainage. Other indications for drainage of the pleuralspace include the nding of thick pus at diagnostic thor- acentesis, presence of fever and systemic illness after 5 to 7days of therapy, presence of effusion for more than 10 days, and, in cases of toxic shock with S aureus , debulking disease and thus toxins. Data are limited regarding an optimal drainage proce- dure; therefore, the procedure type is often based on insti- tutional expertise, availability, and provider comfort. Options include thoracentesis, chest tube placement with or without brinolytics, VATS, and thoracotomy for open decortication. Randomized controlled trials in which VATSwas compared to the use of a chest tube with brinolytics indicated that the therapies are equivalent in terms of lengthof stay but favored the chest tube with brinolytics in terms of cost and favored VATS in terms of rates of need for Figure 3.

(60)(61) Fibrinolytics should be considered with chest tube placement to address loculated infection and to facilitate ef fluent drainage. Choice ofbrinolytic is dictated in part by availability, with tissue plasminogen activator being the most commonly used in the United States. Dosages have not been fully validated in children and are variable in the literature. (60)(62) By extrapolating the adult dosages, our center uses tissue plasminogen activator of 0.1 mg/kg, given in 3 total doses (every 24 hours) with a dwell time of 1 hour (Fig 3). (6) Lung abscesses are increasingly rare in pediatric com- plicated pneumonia because of increased access to care and treatment with antibiotics. They may occur as a complica-tion within necrotizing pneumonia but can also occur in cases of more subacute scenarios. Lung abscesses are char- acterized by the presence of a well-de ned\"rim\"ofbrosis around liquefaction necrosis, with or without air fluid levels. The primary parenchymal infection that leads to a lung abscess may originate hematogenously, via aspiration of oral flora, or secondary to an inhaled foreign body. Owing to their rarity in previously healthy children, lung abscesses shouldtrigger further consideration of underlying conditions orpredisposing risk factors, including aspiration (acute or chronic), foreign body, and structural abnormality, such as a pulmonary sequestration or congenital pulmonary airway ). Immunode ciency or chronic infection should be considered when M tuberculosis or en- demic fungi are identi ed. It is dif cult to differentiate lung abscess from other structurally similar complications, such as loculated pneumothorax, pneumatocele, or cavitary necrosis. Chest CT is the imaging modality of choice. There is not strong evidence that surgical drainage of small to moderately sized abscesses improves outcomes over pro-longed medical therapy alone. (63) Aspiration and culture of fluid from lung abscesses are typically reserved for patients who do not respond to appropriate antibiotics within 5 to 7days because drainage carries risk, and most abscesses will drain spontaneously via the bronchial tree. Antibiotic treat- ment must often be initiated without a specimen or before identi cation of speci c bacteria. Parenteral therapy should reflect the empirical recommendations in Fig 1, with care given to considering additional anaerobes and gram-negativeorganisms if aspiration is suspected as the etiologic origin of the abscess. Duration of treatment is typically 4 to 6 weeks, with at least 1 to 2 weeks of therapy after resolution of fever and until normalization of in flammatory markers. Perform- ing repeat imaging to follow up resolution is indicated. When lung necrosis and abscess develop near the pleural boundary, in flammation and infection can erode from theairway and enter the pleural space, creating an air leakknown as a bronchopleural stula. This complication is rare in pediatric pneumonia, but some single-center retrospec- tive case reviews have indicated increasing rates associated with speci c pneumococcal serotypes. (64) Care of this complication is not straightforward and requires a multi-specialty approach, including surgical consultation. Round pneumonia is a separate complication from an abscess, although also very rare. It has a distinctive radio- logic pattern, described as an opaque round shape, and a study of children with round pneumonia typically demon- strated the consolidations to have well-de ned borders, to be located posteriorly, and to be solitary in their distribution.Round lesions on chest radiographs should trigger consid- eration of a broader differential diagnosis, including fungal infection, lung abscess, and congenital or acquired pulmo- nary malformations such as cysts, congenital pulmonary airway malformation, or pulmonary sequestration, as well as a range of neoplasms, including lymphoma and neuro- blastoma. (65) Primary pulmonary malignancies are rare in pediatrics. Necrotizing pneumonia is an inexact term used to denote evidence of parenchymal necrosis in the lung. It is commonlya precursor for a range of complications, including lung abscess and pneumatocele. Radiologically, these changes appear as focal lucencies on chest radiographs, often with an accompanying parapneumonic effusion. CT scans, when obtained, show areas of low attenuation within the paren- chyma that are attributed to liquefaction; these areas can be patchy or continuous, with an area of consolidation. Impor- tantly, the term necrotizing pneumonia conveys an assessment of clinical severity out of proportion to traditional symptomsof severe pneumonia, since some of these patients progressrapidly to septic shock and respiratory failure. Necrotizing pneumonia is thought to be caused by particularly virulent bacterial strains of S pyogenes, S pneumoniae, orSa u r e u s , par- ticularly Sa u r e u s harboring Panton-Valentine leukocidin, a toxin associated with neutrophil lysis. (66) Similar to patients with lung abscess discussed earlier, most cases of necrotizing pneumonia resolve with medical treatment alone. Antimicrobial therapy of complicated pneumonia should include coverage for S pneumoniae for all patients, and for very ill patients or those with in fluenza ,therapy should include coverage for S pyogenes and S aureus, with consid- eration for empirical MRSA coverage. Antimicrobial agents should be narrowed as soon as possible, (67) as directed by culture results and local epidemiology (Fig 1). Two to 4 weeks of antibiotic therapy is typical for treatment of com- plicated pneumonia; however, there is a lack of data to support a de nitive length of treatment. Length of therapy Vol. 38 No. 9 SEPTEMBER 2017 405 by guest on November 14, 2018 http://pedsinreview.aappublications.org/ Downloaded from should be determined by the clinical course and response to therapy. Parenteral antibiotics are recommended for initialtherapy to optimize antimicrobial concentrations in the lung tissue and pleural fluid. The decision to transition a patient with complicated CAP to oral antibiotics is best guided by clinical response, including improved respiratory status, decreasing fever, and decreasing in flammatory markers. In a recent study, there were no differences in complicationsrelated to infection in patients treated with IV versus oral antibiotics. (61) Severe pneumonias have other well-described associa- tions worth mentioning that may complicate care in the acute setting. These include syndrome of inappropriateantidiuretic hormone and hemolytic-uremic syndrome (par- ticularly with S pneumoniae ).Another rare complication of pneumonia is empyema necessitans. This occurs wheninfected fluid in the chest erodes into the chest wall, causing local symptoms where the erosion occurs. Empyema neces-sitans is seen in more indolent infection that has gone undetected, such as with actinomycetes or mycobacteria or, rarely, inadequately treated traditional bacterial compli- cated pneumonia. USE OF FOLLOW-UP RADIOLOGY Repeat chest radiography is indicated in cases of clinicaldeterioration or instability after 24 to 48 hours of antibiotics. Identi cation of effusion or worsening in ltrate can inform decisions about broadening antibiotic coverage or consid-eration of pleural drainage. In patients with a chest tube in place, standards vary from institution to institution about serial chest imaging, with some supporting daily radiographs to be acquired to be ableto monitor chest tube placement, while others only repeat chest radiography in cases of clinical deterioration or pos- sible tube malfunction. In the outpatient realm, repeat chest radiographs are not indicated in most cases of mild, moderate, or even severe pneumonia. Because recurrent pneumonia in a speci c location may suggest underlying anatomic abnormalities,chest imaging should be repeated 6 to 8 weeks after clinical resolution of pneumonia. Complete radiologic resolution ofacute pneumonia occurs by 2 months in more than 90% of cases. (68) Radiographic resolution of a lung abscess and round pneumonia should be documented. RECURRENT BACTERIAL PNEUMONIAS Recurrent pneumonia is de ned by more than 2 episodes of pneumonia in 1 year or more than 3 episodes in a lifetime.Approximately 8% of patients hospitalized for pneumoniameet these criteria. (68) Regardless of the age of the patient,recurrent pneumonia should trigger further evaluation for underlying microbiological, fu nctional, anatomic, and chronic disease factors. (69)(70) Conducting radiologic follow-up at 2 months to distinguish persistent from recurrent pneu- monias is reasonable to assist in determination of a differ- ential diagnosis and to direct further imaging, laboratory testing, and procedural evaluation. (68) Diagnosis of recurrent or persistent pneumonia is con- rmed by means of persistent ndings of opaci cation on chest radiographs. Further evaluation of persistent localizedconsolidation starts with direct visualization and samplingof the affected region by means of flexible bronchoscopy and bronchoalveolar lavage. Cytologic analysis and culture ofthefluid can demonstrate persistent pathogens or suggest aspiration if a high burden of lipid-laden macrophagesis seen. CT with contrast material is used to evaluate the parenchyma and distal airways. Pathologic changes such as airway bronchiectasis, cystic changes, and congenital se- questrations and infectious complications, such as cavitary abscesses or pleural effusion with loculations, can directfurther evaluation and therapies. Consolidations that persist and/or recur in the same area suggest a persistent pathogen or a focal anatomic abnor- mality. Persistent infectious causes include less common pathogens, such as tuberculosis, endemic fungal infections, Actinomyces , and nocardiosis. Focal anatomic abnormalities include obstructing lesions of the airway, including a re-tained foreign body, compressing lymph node or tracheal growth, compressing vascular rings or slings, and dynamic obstruction due to compressive tracheal tracheomalacia or bronchomalacia. Other focal as segmental bronchiectasis, tracheal bron- chus, pulmonary sequestration, or airway cyst, can lead to poor mucociliary clearance. Right middle lobe syndrome de- scribes the presence of recurrent right middle lobe con-solidations that likely occur because of poor collateral ventilation due to the acute angle to that lobe from the right mainstem bronchus. This lobe is more susceptible to atel- ectasis, aspiration, and lymph node compression. Inltrates that recur, but in anatomically distinct areas, invoke concern for immune defects or dif culties with air- way clearance. Asthma causes recurrent atelectasis and in- ltrates due to airway in flammation and mucus plugging. Associated symptoms of airway reactivity, including night-time cough and wheeze that is worse with activity, can suggest uncontrolled asthma. Other defects and/or diseases to consider include cystic brosis, ciliary defects, surfactant protein defects, HIV, and congenital immune de ciencies. 406 Pediatrics in Review by guest on November 14, 2018 http://pedsinreview.aappublications.org/ Downloaded from A negative newborn screening test nding for cystic brosis should not deter the provider from pursuing a sweat chlo- ride test. If results are positive, the provider should contact the nearest cystic brosis center for further evaluation. Another unusual cause to consider is recurrent bacterial seeding of the lungs in patients with cardiac defects, espe- cially valvular disease and septal defects. The tempo of the evaluation is dictated by the severity of the illness. For example, chronic hypoxemia, hypoventila- tion, weight loss, persistent fevers, anemia, leukopenia or leukocytosis, or digital clubbing would all trigger a more aggressive approach. Recurrent pneumonia evaluation can be aided by referral to specialists, including an infectiousdisease specialist, pulmonologist, and otolaryngologist. DIAGNOSIS AND MANAGEMENT OF PNEUMONIA IN PATIENTS WITH NEUROMUSCULAR DISEASE Pneumonia in patients with neuromuscular disease (in- cluding spinal muscular atrophy and Duchenne muscular dystrophy) requires additional diagnostic considerations and management recommendations. Because of persistentmuscle weakness that leads to restrictive lung physiology, most patients with neuromuscular disease have decreased total lung capacity. Compounding this physiology, these patients often have impaired cough function at baseline, and bulbar weakness may increase the risk for aspiration into the lungs. Thus, these patients are at high risk for developing pneumonia in general, and it can be community acquired, hospital acquired, or health care associated. Once infected, the decreased pulmonary reserve accelerates dete- rioration to respiratory failure in these patients. (71) Initial diagnosis and stabilization should include early consideration of chest radiography, electrocardiography,blood gas analysis, and assessment of electrolyte levels. Patients with spinal muscular atrophy are at risk for hypo- glycemia if they receive nothing by mouth for 4 to 6 hours and should be started on IVdextrose, regardless of hydration status, if they receive nothing by mouth. Empirical antibiotic coverage includes traditional CAP coverage, but based on clinical history, risk factors, and past microbiology, may need to be expanded to cover anaerobes, gram-negative nd- ings (including Supportive oxy-gen and biphasic noninvasive ventilation is often essential,being mindful that increasing fractional index of oxygen alone or instituting continuous positive airway pressure may blunt the hypoxic respiratory drive response in the setting of chronic hypercapnia. Airway clearance regimens that include mechanical insuf flation-exsuf flation impor- tant in aiding mucus clearance and airway recruitment.Admission criteria for patients with neuromuscular disease are more conservative, requiring assessment of each patient in relationship to his or her pulmonary baseline. If the patient requires continuous nasal intermittent positive pressure ventilation, new or increased oxygen requirement,or new or worsened hypercapnia or if suctioning and cough augmentation requirements are frequent, the patient should be admitted with consideration of critical care services. Consider cardiac dysfunction as either primary or secondary to respiratory distress, since many of these patients develop cardiomyopathy (particularly with Duchenne muscular dystrophy).
