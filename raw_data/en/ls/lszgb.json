What is acupuncture? Acupuncture has been practiced on both humans and animals for thousands of years. The treatment consists of placing very small needles into the skin to stimulate points on the body, facilitating self-healing. It is absolutely safe and in fact, most pets don't even realize the needles are being placed and oftentimes fall asleep during each session. Info on acupuncture sessions at NHS: Each session lasts a total of 40 to 60 minutes. During the first 15 minutes, Dr. Z will assess your pet's overall health through a physical exam and a brief overview of their medical history. The following 30 minutes is dedicated to needle placement and treatment time. The number of acupuncture treatments needed depends on the nature, severity and duration of a condition being treated. A single treatment may be enough for an acute condition while a series of three to ten treatments may resolve many chronic problems. Some chronic conditions may need monthly treatments spread over time. Dr. Z will always go over all treatment plans with you and your family!
