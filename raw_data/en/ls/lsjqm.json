Gazing around the room, aching for the last twenty minutes to pass, there were only two things I noticed besides the painfully slow minute hand of the clock. The only other noise over the hum of a tractor engine outside cutting the lawn was the sound of the perpetual rattling of a blue asthma inhaler belonging to the boy next to me and his incessant sniffing. This was a time long before scientists identified that emotions could affect your health but even the least empathic teenager could see that that the lawnmower had possibly affected that poor lad's life forever, and I often get angry thinking about it now. What idiot booked a soccer field cut on the day a child, so afflicted with allergies, has his most important exam? Of course, then, we would just have thought it was the grass that had set off a reaction, but not really understood why. Now we also know that the fact he was in an exam, under stressful conditions and that he could see his nemesis spraying a pretty green fountain out of the mower blades actually made his body react in a far more aggressive way. To make matters worse, I am sure he was panicking that his future was slipping away with this empty paper. Such a terrible shame. Welcome to the cruel world of allergies and the atopic response. I first discovered the Atopic March when I was writing my book the Aromatherapy Eczema Treatment and I had wanted to see if I could find any official evidence to the long held belief that there was a triangle of disorders that existed in families; that if there was eczema in the family then it was more likely that there would be asthma and hay fever too. I was more than a little shocked to find that it was way more than an alternative medicine theory but in fact it had developed into a whole discipline of orthodox medicine in its own right. This branch of psychoneuroimmunology investigates why there will be a developed predisposition to certain illnesses but also that it pertains very much to a certain personality type and is now thought to be an immune response to an overdriving reaction to stress . The Atopic March This is the connection between eczema in young children and how they are likely to develop respiratory allergies and asthma later in their life. Often (but not always) there are familial links existing between the three illnesses. Certainly, 8 Aromatherapy Journal Summer 2015.2 \u00a9 Copyright 2015 NAHA if there is one of the illnesses in the family, it does increase the chances of the child being affected. In many children, allergic eczema will eventually develop from a skin condition into wheezing and asthma because of the high levels of an antibody called immunoglobulin E (IgE). Then, over time, this inflated level may also start to begin to translate into allergic rhinitis too. 70% of patients with severe AD develop asthma, as opposed to just 20-30% of those with mild eczema and only 8% of the general population. During springtime in the UK tulips bloom at the same time the leaves and pollen are starting to form on the trees. Hay fever season usually follows quite quickly. But that is only one allergy. The Atopic March pertains to allergic rhinitis so this refers to any allergy that will make your nose run and your eyes itch; hay fever is very often the culprit but it could just as likely be dust, cat hair or feathers etc. It is known that the first five years of a child's life is critical in terms of managing how Atopic March will unfold for a child. Understanding the levels of IgE, especially between the ages of two to four years, gives an extremely good indication of whether a more sinister breathing problem might rear its ugly head in the future. Any number of genetic or environmental issues might determine whether the eczema translates into breathing problems from pollution in children's surroundings and even their diet; however, one thing is clear. The correlation between the severity of their symptoms and the likelihood that a new illness would emerge is very strong. It is still not fully understood why some children might outgrow their symptoms but the likelihood of a child developing asthma from an original disease of eczema is 2.14 times, more than twice as likely. Bizarrely, amongst all of these skin and nose problems, it might be that we find that the problem may be linked to the liver. The likelihood of a child having Non Alcoholic Fatty Liver Disease (NAFLD) is increasing every year, but if a child already has this atopic link then their chances of the liver anomaly are a lot higher. As far back as 1976 a strong link was established between liver disease and elevated levels of immunoglobulin E as a cause of it. Sufferers of liver disease are eight times as likely to have elevated levels of immunoglobulin E than those who do not have the disease. Scientists now agree that both Allergic Asthma (AA) and Atopic Dermatitis (AD) have links in distinct immunological abnormalities through this expression of IgE. There is growing evidence that when IgE hyper-secretes then it activates T-cells that trigger inflammatory responses and over time cause the illnesses to become chronic: Environmental stressors cause the body to activate B-cells. Immunoglobulin E binds to receptors on mast cells and basophils in tissues. The cross linking of the receptor bound IgE triggers the proinflammatory mediators. Itching and sneezing are triggered. Understanding Allergies NAHA's Aromatherapy Journal9 \u00a9 Copyright 2015 NAHA B-cells, very similar in nature to the more well-known T-cells. They are highly specialised defender cells in your immune system which recognise invaders attacking your system. They then multiply, surround, and ideally overcome the alien intruder. Our bodies are designed in the most extraordinary way. It used to be thought that when we first encountered a new bacterium, we would evolve a completely new set of molecules to fight it. More recent thinking suggests that our bodies are already evolved in such a way that we are actually born with defences to fight every bacteria we might ever encounter and that our defences simply have to recognise it and then select the right molecule to overcome it. The body does this through receptors and ligands. Again, we used to think of receptors like keyholes and ligands being the correct key to open the cell. In essence the outcome is the same but we now recognise the action more like wiggling against each other , rather than slotting inside. Once the ligand on the bacterium activates a receptor on the right B-cell, the body can move on to round two of the fight. So then, when the body perceives a reactive cat hair or insidious pollen molecule it reacts in the same way as it might to the Ebola virus. It despatches a B-cell to send it on its way, and most importantly the B-cell will recruit an army of T-cells. It will also remember the \"bad guy\" too and it will be able to react in the same way every time. With the help of T-cells, B-cells then make proteins called antibodies. These stick to the surface of the cells and alert the rest of your body to the presence of an intruder. In this case, we have the antibody immunoglobulin E. Through the atopic connection, it is likely that the levels of IgE in the system are already very high and so this addition of new IgE triggers a mega-release of what doctors call pro-inflammatory mediators to protect the site so it can heal from the invasion (in exactly the same way as there is redness and inflammation around a cut). In fact the response starts far earlier on, hence this process is now called the Late Phase Response. These reactions actually started with a stress response twenty four hours earlier in the HPA axis. This axis is how the body responds to the stress triggers via the: Hypothalamus Pituitary Adrenals.The hypothalamus is the \"big boss\" of the endocrine system. When it perceives danger it is its job to send warning messages to the pituitary to activate the flight and flight response. The pituitary, whose responsibility it is to secrete many of the hormones we use, manufactures ACTH (Adrenocorticotrophic Hormone) which encourages the secretion of stress hormones by the adrenal glands. These secrete adrenaline , to help us respond quickly to danger, noradrenaline , that continues to keep us alert, and also cortisol. Understanding Allergies continued 10 Aromatherapy Journal Summer 2015.2 \u00a9 Copyright 2015 NAHA Cortisol is a natural anti-inflammatory, and it is supposed to regulate the effects of the other stress hormones. It regulates blood sugar, fat, protein and carbohydrate production amongst many other things. The problem is, if secreted for long enough, cortisol will actually turn on its own axis and becomes inflammatory to a great many processes. It takes and takes from the adrenal gland until the adrenals are entirely fatigued and they then have to steal energy from other organs to function...albeit at a far less effective level. Tests were carried out on a series of youngsters who had AD. They were given the Triers test, which is a series of mental arithmetic questions. Interestingly those with AD showed a blunted cortisol response; that is they did not secrete as much as they should have done. The researchers wanted to know, is this relevant only to AD or to other allergies too? So they repeated the same test with youngsters who had AA, and the findings were the same, blunted cortisol response. And on further investigation, also low levels of ACTH. This showed them that the atopic reaction was indeed related to some part of the HPA axis and the low levels of ACTH helped them to identify that the problem was most likely to come from the pituitary gland. More interestingly, the subjects with AD had increased levels of IgE and eosophils but not of cortisol. This revelation about the HPA axis creates quite a shift in our understanding about allergies. That is to say that allergies are in fact a certain type of immune profile that triggers allergic inflammation. But the most interesting aspect is yet to come. Twenty four hours after the stress test, it was observed that each of the skin conditions of the Atopic Dermatitis (AD) subjects had worsened demonstrating the deleterious effects of the stress on an allergic symptom. Animal research has some interesting insights to offer us too. Studies into baby rats show that their inflammatory response kicks into gear when there is a change in the maternal behavior which will cause them their own rodent brand of stress. When the mother licked and groomed them more, baby rattus had clear inflammatory changes observed. The more over bearing the mother became, the more pronounced the inflammatory responses were. This ties in very neatly with the common response you will hear from mothers of allergic children: \"I have to be so careful. He is such a sensitive child.\" There might be more to that statement than meets the eye. Thanks to a technique called semeiometry, we are able to gain new and Understanding Allergies continued Summer 2015.2 NAHA's Aromatherapy Journal11 \u00a9 Copyright 2015 NAHA intriguing insights into the atopic psychology. Semeiometry was originally devised as a means of allowing doctors to better understand their patients without asking them direct questions. The tests involved asking a series of very ordinary words and asking the subjects if they like or do not like them. (Scale: -3, -2, -1-, 0, +1, +2, +3 strongly dislike through to strongly like ) In 1993 Marion Merel Dow asked the Gallup society SOFRES to undertake a study of French citizens aged 15+. They sent out 20,000 letters and received 17,084 replies. 1,833 of those were from allergic patients. The statistical analysis revealed a very interesting emergence of three very distinct allergic personality profiles. The asthmatic person tended to be regressive and in need of protection . He behaved as if he were very frightened of adult life. The allergic rhinitis sufferer by contrast had a much more adult outlook on life. He tended to be far more sensual and harmonious , and he aspired more to an independence of spirit . Patients with atopic eczema were described as exhibiting feminine and maternal traits, but were largely narcissistic in their view of life and were fearing of power . In 2005, a Greek study took this further to try to understand the profile of a rhinitis sufferer more fully. They undertook another semeiometic profile, this time of adults on the island of Crete. This was a far smaller sample of 113 people. Using a skin prick test they were able to evaluate that 61% were allergic and 39% were non allergic. A very clear psychological profile of the allergic rhinitis sufferer began to emerge. They had very strong attachments to family values. Words that came high on their \"likes\" scale were nurture, frankness, honest and politeness. These were accompanied by very strong societal values: justice , family, faith, were all words that seemed to float to the top. These were ideals that seemed to keep them in harmonious accord with others. They seemed to be very heavily invested in sensual values. Words that triggered a like response were open, emotion, sensuous, delicate, present, sweet, which seemed to illustrate their desire for freedom. By contrast there was an overwhelming desire to reject values that seemed to imply conflict: betray, war, lie, rifle, detachment, metallic and soldier all elicited strong negative associations. The test showed that in contrast to the call to arms of other personalities, the allergic rhinitis sufferer prefers to invest in values that provoked them to exaggerated emotions: adore, wish, God, religious and cry. Most interesting was the survey showed that these people seemed to gravitate to certain professions too -such as housewives, public servants and private employees. Later papers have taken the findings further to assert that atopic people in general are more intelligent, more timid, suspicious, anxious, tense and just less emotionally stable somehow. It is now very well accepted that allergic symptoms can be affected by several psychological factors or by stress. Studies show that introverted people have a far worse time with their allergic responses than extroverted people do. They experience greater degrees Understanding Allergies continued12 Aromatherapy Journal Summer 2015.2 \u00a9 Copyright 2015 NAHA of depression and anxiety than their outgoing counterparts. People with affective disorders also have a far higher prevalence of atopy than the general population. Those prone to clinical depression also suffer more from allergies than the general public. Women with perennial allergic rhinitis have been found to have poorer psychological functionality than non-allergics. Analyses Personality Profiles (MMPI) demonstrate allergic sufferers score significantly higher on the Hypochondriasis and Social Introversion scales and significantly lower on the Correction and Ego Strength scales. In studies of non-psychiatric populations males with allergic rhinitis have been found to exhibit higher scores of paranoia, depression and social introversion. Authors of a recent paper hypothesized that the elevated levels of the central corticotrophin factor (CRF1) which has been found to be elevated in depressed patients (and is considered by psychoneuroimmunologists to be the molecule of negative expectation) might actually decrease the threshold of itching and so might explain the link between pruritis and depression, but the theory has not yet been adequately tested to say whether this is true. Nevertheless we do have quite a good picture of what our sneeze-y client might be like even before they come through the door now. Allergies and Aromatherapy Does all of this research help us to know how to help people in the context of aromatherapy? Certainly it does, as long as we approach each person with open mindedness, smiling as confirmations come up of our theories rather than imposing them on the client at the start. It is important to use these studies and evidences as a map to help us, rather than as a signpost indicating we have already reached that conclusion. We now know that underneath that surface of allergic reaction are many more layers for us to peel away. One single bottle of essential oil, absolutely will not do the job. It has to be a structured, multifaceted approach that will take time. Yes, you can soothe the symptoms very well and extremely quickly. I served my apprenticeship in my mother's aromatherapy business The Apothecary , travelling around flower and agricultural shows in the 1990's and hundreds of times I saw hay fever symptoms recede in less than five minutes...but the allergy was still there. They would have to come back for another pot of cream or suffer again. Now we know more about the illness, it is possible to bring about even greater effects, but again you will need to see your client over a period of weeks. Understanding Allergies continued Aromatherapy Recipe for Allergic Attack Ingredients: 1/2 oz sunflower ( frankincense ( Boswellia serrata ) Rub the blend over the cheekbones during an attack. Suitable for children or adults of all ages. If irritation occurs, discontinue use. Avoid use during pregnancy and with young children.Summer 2015.2 NAHA's Aromatherapy Journal13 \u00a9 Copyright 2015 NAHA Steps for Helping Allergies with Essential Oils Layer One - Calm the Symptoms In my opinion, the best anti-allergenic essential oil that you will find is melissa (Melissa officinalis). At the moment, the essential oil that I have in my essential oil box is melissa (true) because of the delicate nature of a little boy I help who has epilepsy. However, for the most part, I have found melissa (natural identical type) to be just as effective for helping allergies. For the itching and scratching, I find going back to basics is fine with true lavender (Lavandula angustifolia) and Roman chamomile (Anthemis nobilis) essential oils. For really bad onslaughts of symptoms, I might try German chamomile (Matricaria recutica) or even yarrow (Achillea millefolium) essential oil . For sinus conditions I would normally opt for the decongestant properties of myrrh Understanding Allergies continued Aromatherapy Back and Shoulders Massage Recipe Ingredients: 1/2 oz evening primrose ( vetiver ( Vetiveria zizanioides) Massage the blend over the back and shoulders to soothe the stress. Avoid use during pregnancy and with young children. If irritation occurs, discontinue use.(Commiphora myrrha) essential oil, but given the slightly needier psychological profile here, I would choose frankincense (Boswellia serrata) essential oil to plump up the confidence a bit, liberate any respiratory constriction, and flush out the sinuses at the same time. Layer Two - Soothe the Stress For all of my clients, I find keeping a mood diary is useful. It helps me to track symptoms and moods outside the person's own perceptions of themselves. Hopefully the stress will be acute, ephemeral and fleeting, but for the most part I find that it is usually chronic and potentially the allergy is merely one aspect of a whole myriad of symptoms I refer to as yin disease, where the body is worn out, exhausted and has lost its aggressive yang balance. I have found that the most effective way to help these symptoms is to initially kickstart the HPA axis with Holy basil ( Ocimum sanctum) essential oil . It is an resets the body to the \"factory settings\" -before the stress attack took place. 14 Aromatherapy Journal Summer 2015.2 \u00a9 Copyright 2015 NAHA Understanding Allergies continued Aromatherapy Recipe to Cleanse the System In this recipe, both mandarin (Citrus reticulata) and geranium (Pelargonium graveolens) essential oils help to support the adrenal glands. Nutmeg (Myristica fragrans) essential oil helps to and to balance ACTH and or evening primrose (Oenothera biennis) oil work rather nicely. Essential Oils: 2 drops of mandarin (Citrus reticulata) 2 drops geranium (Pelargonium graveolens) 1 drop nutmeg (Myristica fragrans) Massage lotion or oil daily into the wrists. Avoid use during pregnancy and with young children. If irritation occurs, discontinue use.To put a rocket of dynamite under the worn out body while stroking away the stress, I would opt to use the yang energy of vetiver (Vetiveria zizanioides) essential oil . Layer Three - Cleanse the System Level Four - Ease the Spirit It is worth checking how a person's chakras are performing. This slightly floaty ethereal, life-is-lovely approach is usually indicative of an over performing crown chakra with an under developed root chakra. In fact the mirror image of the same dysfunction is paranoia; there is too much going on in your head, with no sense of grounding happening to balance it. Since the root chakra is where we establish our sense of identity in the first seven years of life, our self-esteem, our feelings about security... this would very much also fit with the idea of been a bit too over protected and smothered. A person has never really found their feet. Again, this indicates the use of vetiver (Vetiveria zizaniodes) essential oil because of how effectively it pulls the energy of the chakras back down to the root chakra to ground it. You can almost guarantee the sensitive allergic client has been smothered by his family and probably teased, or even been bullied, in the outside world (or actually it might be more correct to say that he perceives that he has been which is very much an aspect of yin disease). It is now entirely appropriate to look to see just how much their mother is annoying them, because the central nervous system is absolutely locked into the sensitivity of allergens. Are they sad and depressed or Aromatherapy Recipe to Cleanse the Liver Ingredients: 2 oz borage (Borago officinalis) or evening oil Essential drops carrot (Daucus carota) 1 drop rosemary (Rosmarinus officinalis var. limonene) 2 Maroc peppermint ( Mentha x piperita ) 2 drops blue gum eucalyptus (Eucalyptus globulus) 4 drops ginger (Zingiber officinale) Contraindications: Do not use with epilepsy and in cases of high blood pressure.

Summer is associated with the Fire element in the Chinese Five Element theory. The Fire element is associated with creativity, intuition, and motion. The corresponding color is red and the emotion is joy. This is the most yang time of year: a time of expansion, action, and outward movement. Similarly, in Ayurveda, summer is associated with Pitta; energy that is fiery and intense. Staying cool, both environmentally and emotionally, will help you to feel more in balance. Diet and exercise are important to keep the Fire element and Pitta balanced. Avoid heavy foods that will make you feel sluggish. Eat plenty of cool, light foods such as fruits and vegetables. Try fresh basil (Ocimum basilicum) , sliced tomatoes (Solanum lycopersicum), sea salt, , and balsamic vinegar with olive (Olea europea) oil for a delicious salad. Lightly cooked food is beneficial. Stir-frying is a nice way to lightly cook vegetables. Staying hydrated is essential. I like to add fresh mint (Mentha x piperita) and slices of lemon (Citrus limon) , orange (Citrus sinensis) , and lime (Citrus aurantifolia) to a pitcher of water. While staying cool is important, avoid iced drinks which can weaken the digestion. Summer is the perfect time for outdoor exercise, gardening, playing sports, getting together with friends, and taking hikes in nature. Instead of staying inside and feeling shy, try your best to get outdoors and meet new people. Let yourself play instead of being overly serious. At midday, come inside and take a nap or some quiet time to avoid overexposure to the sun. Wearing cotton clothing will also help you to stay cool. Making time for relaxation is highly beneficial because summer can be a time of high excitement, lots of activity, late nights, and overexertion.

In recent years, not only has it come to \"light\" that that we need vitamin D from the sun, but that the sun's rays can be very damaging to our skin. The good news is that natural carrier oils can make highly effective sunscreen that is not only high in sun protection factor (SPF), but great for the skin in other ways. Learn all the ways that natural carrier oils and essential oils can become part of your summer fun and skin safety in this article. How the Skin is Protected From the Sun The skin is protected from sunburn in a variety of ways; remember these points to prevent sunburn: KEEP HYDRATED: Suggestion: Drink three to five quarts of water a day. MOISTURIZE THE SKIN: All body butters and carrier oils help the skin to retain water and they also help the body to create vitamin D from the sun's damaging UVB rays. ANTIOXIDANTS: All unrefined oils contain vitamin E, and those particularly high in vitamin E are traditionally considered to be \"sun protecting.\" Tocopherols, e.g., vitamin E, repair free radical damage to the skin. BLOCK UVA AND UVB RAYS: Clothing, sun hats, and shade best limit your sun exposure from 10am to 3pm when UV rays are the strongest; this will vary by the season, location, and time of day. Sunburned skin doesn't just feel awful; it can cause permanent damage over time. The sunlight that reaches us is made up of two types of harmful rays: long wave ultraviolet A (UVA) and short wave ultraviolet B (UVB). Basically, UVA rays can age us and UVB rays can burn us. Overexposure to either can damage the skin. USE A NATURAL SUNSCREEN: Nature has provided us with a whole host of natural ingredients that give sun protection factor (SPF). Plants are exposed to the sun every day of every year, and so have evolved to produce pigments, phytochemicals and nutrients that protect them from sun damage. Many liquid carrier or base oils used in aromatherapy blends are extracted from fruit and vegetable seeds. Their penetrating properties and nutrients, as well as their natural content of tocopherols, carotenoids and essential fatty acids, make them highly valuable. There are several natural-based sunscreen lotions that include the carrier oils of (Sesamum indicum) , which have been reported to have UV filters. 22 Aromatherapy Journal Summer 2015.2 \u00a9 Copyright 2015 NAHA Carrier Oils for Sun Protection continued Chemicals in Sunscreens Why use carrier oils as a natural sunscreen? Because typical commercial sunscreens may contain one or more of these potentially two of the most powerful free radical generators known to man. Other chemicals on this list have been connected to conditions like cancer and hormonal imbalance. Zinc oxide is another popular natural ingredient in sunscreens, but researchers at Missouri State University recently found that when exposed to sunlight, zinc oxide may create free radicals, destroy cells, and increase the risk of skin cancer. And your skin cannot make vitamin D when you use zinc oxide sunscreen. Carrier Oils as a Sunscreen Carrier or base oils are the fats extracted from seeds, nuts, grains, vegetables and fruits. They can serve as an effective base for a homemade sunscreen. Many vegetable oils, such as olive (Olea europaea) oil and jojoba (Simmondsia chinensis) , are already popular for both cosmetic and medicinal purposes. For best results always choose carrier oils that are unrefined, cold pressed, unfractionated, and organic. Several carrier oils have shown extremely positive results in studies to provide SPF protection when applied to skin: Red Raspberry Seed Oil (Rubus idaeus) SPF 28 - 50 This oil is one of the most popular oils for SPF and can have a range of 28 -50 (depending on the quality of the oil). Red raspberry seed oil is actually a close equivalent of the protection you would receive from Titanium Dioxide, which is found in most mineral sunscreens. The essential fatty acids and host of antioxidants in this oil are also great for other skin healing purposes including eczema and psoriasis. Red raspberry seed oil protects against UVA & UVB rays and contains significant anti-inflammatory properties. Carrot Seed Oil (Daucus carota) SPF 38 - 40According to a study published in Pharmacognosy Magazine in 2009, products containing carrot seed oil have a natural SPF of between 38 and 40. Carrot seed oil is highly valued for skin care. It is used in skin care products to nourish, tighten, revitalize, and rejuvenate skin. Carrot seed oil is calming and appropriate for irritated skin. Note: This refers to the carrier oil, not the essential oil.Red Raspberry (Rubus idaeus)Summer 2015.2 NAHA's (Triticum vulgare ) SPF 20 Wheat germ oil is packed with vitamins and minerals, mostly vitamin E, K and B. It acts as free radical preventer while protecting you from the sun. Wheat germ oil is used to regenerate skin tissues; it promotes skin elasticity, formation of skin cells, improves blood circulation, and helps to relieve symptoms of dermatitis. Note: Those with wheat or gluten allergies should not use wheat germ oil, either externally or internally. Other valuable carrier oils with lesser SPF factors: Almond, Sweet Oil (Prunus dulcis) (SPF 5) Almond oil has a high presence of mono- and polyunsaturated fatty acids. The properties of these components are demonstrated in the oil's protecting, nourishing, softening, and lubricating effects on the skin. Almond oil is ideal for chapped, dry, and irritated skin, soothing and relieving soreness, itching, and inflammation. Avocado Oil (Persea americana) (SPF 4 -10) This carrier oil is high in vitamins A, B, D, lecithin, potassium, proteins, and fatty acids. Although the oil is mono-unsaturated, it is not stable when used for cooking at high temperatures. It is excellent in skin care applications for dry, dehydrated, climate-parched, damaged, undernourished, mature skin, eczema, and diaper rash because of its nourishing, softening, and restorative qualities. Coconut Oil (Cocos nucifera) (SPF 2 - 8) An ideal choice for general skin moisturizing as it serves as a protective layer, helping to retain the moisture in your skin. This mild oil is light and non-greasy and it is suitable for sensitive, dry, itchy, inflamed, and irritated skin. Hemp Seed Oil (Cannabis sativa) (SPF 6) Hemp seed oil may be added to any body care or cosmetic product, including creams, lotions, facial or body oils, massage oils, shampoo, conditioner, shaving products, lip balm, and soap. In hair care products, hemp seed oil increases elasticity, manageability, and shine. Hemp oil has valuable Super Omega-3 (SDA) and Super Omega-6 (GLA), and is loaded with all twenty amino acids. Jojoba (Simmondsia chinensis) (SPF 4) Actually a natural yellow liquid wax from the bean of an evergreen desert plant, jojoba is very close in nature to the human sebum, an excretion from around the hair follicles. Jojoba has replaced sperm whale oil in cosmetics, creams, mascara, and lipstick for more than a century now. It is useful in cases of inflamed skin, psoriasis, eczema, acne, and it is beneficial for hair care. Macadamia Oil (Macadamia integrifolia) (SPF 6) Macadamia oil is high in palmitoleic acid, a monounsaturated fatty acid that acts upon the body as an antioxidant, preventing Carrier Oils for Sun Protection continued24 Aromatherapy Journal Summer 2015.2 \u00a9 Copyright 2015 NAHA Carrier Oils for Sun Protection continued All-Natural Sunscreen This recipe makes 8-oz. You will need an 8-oz glass jar or BPA-free plastic bottle with a flip top. The final product is thick like body butter. Use less beeswax to formulate a more liquid product. Ingredients: 1 cup raw Shea Butter (Butyrospermum parkii) OR Coconut Oil (Cocos nucifera) 4 TBSP grated 4 TBSP Carrot Seed Oil (Daucus carota) 4 TBSP Red Raspberry Seed Oil (Rubus idaeus) TBSP (Commiphora myrrha) 10 and lavender (Lavandula angustifolia) essential oils are not advised while pregnant. Use a lower dilution (1%) of the essential oils for children -- no more than six drops per one oz. Directions for Making: In a double boiler, over low heat, melt the shea butter OR coconut oil, together with the beeswax. When melted, add the other carrier oils to the same temperature. Remove from heat and allow the mixture to cool slightly prior to adding the essential oils. Add the essential oils. Pour the mixture into a glass jar or BPA-free plastic bottle with a flip top. Allow the mixture to cool and harden by leaving the jar or bottle on the counter top. When cool, seal the container and label it. The shelf life of the blend, when stored in a cool cupboard, is 30 days; refrigerate to extend shelf life. citriodora) and all citrus essential oils are photosensitive, and are not advised in a sunscreen product. Summer 2015.2 NAHA's Aromatherapy Journal25 \u00a9 Copyright 2015 NAHA deterioration of cell membranes. Palmitoleic acid is not commonly found in other oils, yet it is found in human sebum that acts as a protective agent and slows down the aging process. Olive Oil (Olea europaea) (SPF 2-8) This oil may be too heavy in viscosity to be suitable for a massage oil; it may be used in small amounts and added to blends. Applications of olive oil include: hair care, cosmetics, salves, rheumatic conditions, and skin care products. Sesame Seed Oil (Sesamum indicum) (SPF 4) Sesame seed oil is rich in vitamins and minerals, containing vitamins A, B complex, calcium, magnesium, and phosphorus. A high content of vitamin E gives this oil excellent stability; some of its other components give it an antioxidant effect. Sesame oil is beneficial as a natural moisturizer for dry skin, psoriasis, eczema, as well as protecting the skin from harmful UV rays, adding warmth, and suppleness to the body. Shea Butter (Butyrospermum parkii) (SPF 3-6) Shea butter is especially known for its cosmetic properties as a moisturizer and emollient. It is also a known anti-inflammatory agent that enhances cell regeneration. Shea butter is effective in addressing the following conditions: aging skin, fading scars, eczema, burns, rashes, acne, severely dry skin, blemishes, dark spots, skin discolorations, chapped lips, stretch marks, wrinkles, and psoriasis. Essential Oil Recipes for Sunscreen Essential oils are highly concentrated and powerful oils that are extracted from flowers and plants. They have three distinct modes of action: Physiological (e.g., anti-inflammatory effects), psychological (e.g., aromatherapy) and cosmetic (e.g., preservative effects because of antibacterial or antioxidant properties). They also have corresponding benefits. Essential oils are a perfect combination to mix with carrier oils to mitigate the damaging effects of sunburn. NOTE: Essential oils are not sunscreens!

Take a walk down the natural deodorant section of your nearest health food store, and you'll find a lot of options. You could spend hours just reading the ingredients of each one, and even then, it can be hit or miss to find something that works for you. Our body chemistry responds differently to different ingredients. I have a few important requirements when it comes to deodorant: It has to feel good. I don't want anything sticky going under my arms. It has to be organic. It has to smell good. It has to work! Sound like a tall order? I'll admit, I did have some trouble finding a natural, organic deodorant that met all my requirements. That's why I started experimenting with my own recipes. I'm happy to say I came up with one that works well for me, even in very hot weather. I live in Florida, and it gets quite hot and humid here. I've since shared this recipe with friends and it's got great results, so I'm excited to share it with you here. I love how customizable this deodorant recipe is. The coconut oil has a slight tropical aroma\u2014perfect for summer\u2014and you can add essential oils to make the scent your own. I suggest adding your essential oils drop by drop so you can make sure that you like the aroma.Natural Deodorant Cream This recipe is so easy to make! I think this is one of the reasons it's so popular. I recommend making it every three months so you always have a fresh jar. Ingredients: 1 oz organic unrefined coconut French green clay 18 drops of essential oil (see next page for suggestions) Supplies: One 2-oz glass jar with a lid A small bowl for mixing A glass stir rod Combine the coconut oil, green clay, and arrowroot powder in the small bowl. Stir these ingredients together with a glass stir rod. Add the essential oils. Stir again. Apply a small amount of the blend under your arm to make sure it feels good. Most people respond very well to it, but it's always important to test to make sure. You can use the tips of your fingers or a cotton round to apply the deodorant. *If you don't have arrowroot powder, you can use baking soda as a substitute. It has the same thickening effect on the blend. However some people may find it irritating which is why I prefer to use arrowroot powder. 28 Aromatherapy Journal Summer 2015.2 \u00a9 Copyright 2015 NAHA Essential Oil Blend Recipes to Use: Summer Citrus* 4 drops Grapefruit ( Citrus x paradisi ) 8 drops Green Mandarin ( reticulata ) 6 drops Lemon ( Citrus limon ) * This blend is well below the phototoxic levels for lemon and grapefruit.

Tea Tree & Witch Hazel Spray-On Deodorant This recipe is easy to make and use with no mess. You can carry it in your purse or gym bag so you'll have it if you're out and about and need to freshen up. It's so nice to have on hand during a hot summer. You can spray it under your arms and all over your body, concentrating on areas where you sweat the most. It's safe for clothes. If you prefer not to use essential oils topically, you're in luck\u2014there are no essential oils in this recipe. It just calls for hydrosols and aloe vera gel. Ingredients: One 1-oz spray bottle Blend the ingredients together and pour into the bottle. You'll need to shake this recipe before every use. I suggest making a fresh bottle every month. If you go through a lot of it, you can multiply the recipe to make a bigger bottle.

The Neural Basis of Olfactory Aromatherapy by Joie Power, Ph.D. Introduction: Aroma Therapy vs. Aromatherapy: What's the Difference? The term \"aromatherapy\" implies a \"therapy\" based on \"aroma,\" but is that what essential oils actually deliver? The answer is \"sometimes, but not always,\" because essential oils can act on us in more than one way. Sometimes aromatherapy is \"aroma therapy\" - a therapeutic intervention based on the effects that odor molecules exert on the brain by activating olfactory receptors - and sometimes it is not. When it is, I call it \"olfactory aromatherapy.\" The term \"aromachology\" has also been proposed by the Sense of Smell Institute to refer to the study of the olfactory effects of essential oils and to differentiate the scientific approach to those effects from the practice of aromatherapy, which has been criticized by some for lack of a scientifically rigorous basis. I prefer the term \"olfactory aromatherapy.\" Many aromatherapists speak of three \"routes\" through which the constituents of essential oils exert their effects - the oral route, the topical route and the inhalation route - but these are really methods of delivery rather than physiological routes of action. Essential oil constituents sometimes act directly on pathogens and body tissues at their sites of application but in many cases they need to move more deeply into the body in order to exert their therapeutic effects and there are two main physiological pathways through which they can at least theoretically do this: they can be absorbed through the tissues of the body into the bloodstream when delivered orally, topically or by inhalation, or, they can activate the receptors of the olfactory nerve when inhaled. In many practical applications of essential oils in aromatherapy, both pathways may operate at the same time. For convenience, I call the first pathway the \"blood pathway\" and the second the \"nerve pathway.\" Essential oil constituents acting through either pathway have been found to exert effects on mood, behavior and memory as well as autonomic, immune and endocrine function in what has been described as a \"pharmacological\" (drug-like) fashion 7; in other words, through the ability of individual odor molecules to interact with the nervous system in a way that exerts distinctive, reproducible effects that are specific to each odor molecule, just as the conventional drugs used in medicine exert specific, reproducible effects that are unique to each drug. The key here is \"reproducibility\": an essential oil component that is exerting drug-like actions on the nervous system will reliably exert the same effects whenever it is given at the same dose. When we speak of essential 36 Aromatherapy Journal Summer 2015.2 \u00a9 Copyright 2015 NAHA oils that have come to be characterized in the literature and in practice as anxiolytics, antidepressants, or stimulants, for example, we are speaking of effects that arise from this drug-like mode of action. One difference between drugs and essential oils acting in a drug-like fashion through the blood pathway and inhaled essential oils acting in a drug-like fashion through the nerve pathway is that in the former case effects are produced because of receptor binding at sites of action while in the latter they are produced through action potentials that are generated when they bind to olfactory receptors. In addition to acting in a drug-like fashion through either pathway, essential oil components acting through the nerve pathway can also exert effects on all of these same parameters (mood, behavior, etc.) in what has been described as a \"psychological\" fashion. 7 One way in which odor molecules can acquire the ability to operate through the nerve pathway in a psychological fashion is through classical conditioning: when exposure to a specific odor is paired with an emotionally charged event (often an event that is traumatic in some way) then later exposure to that odor can elicit the same emotional and physiological reactions that were experienced during the original event. This happened with a patient of mine who felt nervous every time she got near her new boss - eventually, she realized that this man was wearing the same cologne that her abusive father had worn and it was that odor that was making her feel anxious. The cologne that provoked such intense anxiety in my patient would not do that to someone else unless they had had similar past experiences with it because that odor is not intrinsically anxiety-provoking through drug-like actions.The psychological mode of action is also at work when odors exert idiosyncratic effects that are determined by the smeller's moods or by whether the aroma is perceived by the smeller as pleasant or unpleasant. Studies that support the psychological theory of odorant effects include those showing that things like prosocial behavior, productivity, goal- setting and work efficiency are enhanced in experimental subjects exposed to odors that they perceive as pleasant 1 while those exposed to odors that are perceived as unpleasant have more \"negative\" effects, such as reduced tolerance for frustration 16. As Herz points out, studies in this area suggest that the behavioral responses evoked by pleasant vs. unpleasant odors are correlated with changes in mood and only odors perceived by a smeller as pleasant are able to improve mood, decrease anxiety and exert positive effects on pain perception; odors that are perceived as unpleasant by the smeller exert worsening effects on mood and pain perception 7. Other studies supporting a psychological mode of action for odorants acting through the nerve pathway have looked at the issue of expectations and have shown that when experimental subjects are told that an odor will have a specific effect then the expectation of that effect can play a determining role in the actions exerted by that odor 3. One study has found, however, that expectations only influence effects at lower nasal concentrations of an odorant 12. While a few herbalists feel that direct inhalation of essential oils from fresh or dried plant material will produce the same results as inhalation of distilled essential oils, thereby eliminating the need for use of distilled oils, these results suggest that this may not be the case, since higher nasal It's Just a Smell continuedSummer 2015.2 NAHA's Aromatherapy Journal37 \u00a9 Copyright 2015 NAHA concentrations of essential oil constituents would be expected to result from inhaling distilled oils, especially in undiluted form. It is clear that the effects that can be elicited by inhaled odorants acting through the nerve pathway depend, ultimately, on potentially complex interactions between drug-like effects and psychological effects and this may be at least one reason that studies on the actions exerted by inhaled essential oils have shown mixed results. The aromatherapeutic effects that can be realized through both drug-like and psychological modes of action and that come into play when essential oils are inhaled occur because of the close anatomical and functional associations between the olfactory system and brain regions involved in regulating emotional response, memory and learning and, through projections from these regions, autonomic, immune and endocrine function. We will examine these connections, which form the neural basis of olfactory aromatherapy, in greater detail below. Early Work on Olfactory-Limbic System Connections In the early 1980's I was asked to assist in conducting intraoperative brain mapping procedures at the Medical College of Georgia, where I completed my internship in neuropsychology and then became an Assistant Professor of Neurosurgery. In these procedures, unanaesthetized patients remain fully awake during lengthy neurosurgical interventions so that observations can be made of the effects that are produced when specific brain regions exposed during the surgery are stimulated with a weak electrical current. Such stimulation temporarily \"turns off\" the area that is stimulated and this helps the neurosurgeon avoid cutting out something that is vital to the patient's functional capacities. In addition, these procedures have been important to our understanding of how the brain works since even today there are few other ways in which we can obtain such direct information in real time about the roles played by different brain regions. The neurosurgeon that I worked with in the operating room, Dr. Herman Flanigin, had studied with the famous Canadian neurosurgeon Dr. Wilder Penfield. Dr. Penfield and his colleagues had pioneered the use of stimulation studies and in 1954, Penfield and Jasper made a major advance in the understanding of the olfactory system by reporting their findings that electrical stimulation of the paired bulbs at the base of the frontal lobes produced odor hallucinations 15. As well as representing an important advance in our understanding of how the olfactory system works, Penfield and Jaspers' findings paved the way for further investigations into the links between the olfactory system and other neural systems and, eventually, the links between the sense of smell, emotions and memory. Together with a handful of other neurosurgical teams around the world, Dr. Flanigin and I carried on with Dr. Penfield's work, including intra-operative and pre-operative It's Just a Smell continued 38 Aromatherapy Journal Summer 2015.2 \u00a9 Copyright 2015 NAHA depth electrode stimulation studies. In our procedures, we often observed that stimulation in areas near the olfactory tract and generally considered to be within the limbic system can also produce hallucinated odor experiences and other teams reported similar findings 9. We also found that when our electrical currents entered the amygdala, a key component of the limbic system, attacks of rage could be provoked. The amygdala receives direct input from the olfactory tract and this is a key route through which odors can affect mood and emotional responses. Taken as a whole, these findings helped to establish the limbic system's role in the expression and regulation of emotions and highlighted the functional link between odors and emotions. Through the use of an innovative technique that we developed for cooling and shutting down the hippocampus during brain surgery, Dr. Flanigin and I were also able to show that disabling a functionally intact hippocampus results in deficits in recent memory 5,6.. Like the amygdala, the hippocampus is a component of the limbic system and it is also tied to the olfactory system. Our findings helped to clarify the role of the hippocampus in memory functions and provided further evidence of the close anatomical connections between areas related to smell, emotion and memory. The experience of seeing first-hand the effects of direct stimulation or cooling of the living brain of a conscious human being is something that makes a very strong impression and for me that impression was of the profound and inextricable link between olfaction, emotion and memory. Because of the way in which our brains are \"wired\" these three things are nearly inseparable at a functional level and our everyday experiences and reactions are constantly colored and shaped by the fact that odors have a powerful ability to elicit and even affect emotion, thought and behavior and to exert powerful influences on our moods, reactions, physiology and even on many of the choices that we make. How Odors Exert Effects on Mood, Thought and Behavior: The Neural Basis of Olfactory Aromatherapy In order for odorants to exert effects through the nerve pathway they must activate the olfactory receptors which are found on the primary olfactory neurons that live in the nasal epithelium located high up in the nasal cavity. The issue of what concentrations of odor molecules are needed to effectively activate the receptors is a complex one and varies from odorant to odorant but experience suggests that we can often achieve therapeutic effects through the nerve pathway with inhalation of just a drop or two of distilled essential oil administered in the usual ways. It's Just a Smell continuedSummer 2015.2 NAHA's Aromatherapy Journal39 \u00a9 Copyright 2015 NAHA The olfactory receptors are the gateway to a rapid transit system that carries odor signals into the old limbic regions of the brain, including the amygdala, the hypothalamus and the hippocampus. There are only two synapses between the olfactory receptors and the amygdala and only three between the receptors and the hypothalamus and hippocampus. These regions are responsible for regulating mood and behavior, among other things, and are involved in memory and learning. Through the hypothalamus, olfactory signals are able to move into other areas where they influence autonomic, endocrine and immune function. These connections are ultimately the basis for both the drug-like and psychological effects of odor molecules acting through the nerve pathway. Olfactory coding begins with the olfactory receptors themselves. Humans probably have about forty million primary olfactory neurons (estimates vary widely) and these can be classified into about 350 different types based on the type of receptors they have. Each type of primary olfactory neuron responds to only one or, at best, a few types of odor molecules. In addition, these neurons exhibit different concentration thresholds for the specific odor molecules that bind to them; this is probably at least one of the reasons why the qualitative perception of an odor can change in response to its concentration and it may also explain why some inhaled essential oils seem to have dose-specific effects. Because of the specificity of olfactory receptors in respect to the types of odor molecules that can bind to them, any odor activates a distinctive mosaic of primary olfactory neurons that is unique to that odor. This unique \"signature\" of activated neurons is maintained as the action potentials that are generated by that odor when it binds to its receptors are carried deeper into the olfactory system and it determines, in essence, where those signals ultimately go within the olfactory system. In my opinion, this is probably the primary reason that different odor molecules are able to elicit those distinctive, reproducible, drug-like effects; they send action potentials (nerve signals) to different destinations within and outside of the olfactory system and those action potentials, in turn, influence the release of neurotransmitters and other \"messengers\" at their target sites. This issue of where olfactory signals go is important because in neuroscience we look at what is known about the specific functions of the areas that receive those signals in order to understand the kinds of effects that can be produced by signals that arrive there; the logic here is that if a neural signal can reach an area it can influence the function of that area. The action potentials that are generated when an odor molecules binds to an olfactory receptor go directly to the olfactory bulbs on the underside of the frontal lobes of the brain. This means that there is only one \"synapse\" (the point where one neuron connects with another) between the olfactory receptors and the brain and this is something that is unique to the olfactory system because all other sensory signals must pass through multiple synapses before actually reaching the brain. The fibers that originate from the second order neurons in the olfactory bulbs become the olfactory tracts. The olfactory tracts on either side of the brain are readily visible when you remove a brain from the skull and can be seen It's Just a Smell continued40 Aromatherapy Journal Summer 2015.2 \u00a9 Copyright 2015 NAHA lying on the bottom of the brain. The olfactory tract ultimately dives more deeply into the brain and divides into five branches that carry olfactory signals to areas collectively referred to as the primary olfactory cortex. These areas include: the anterior the olfactory tubercle parts of the amygdala. While all of these projection areas play a role in the processing of olfactory signals, the pyriform cortex is the major target of projections from the olfactory bulb and is an important relay area for odor signals bound for other brain regions. Neurons in the pyriform cortex project to both the orbitofrontal cortex, which has a role in decision making and the regulation of emotional expression, and to areas of the limbic system, including the thalamus, hypothalamus, amygdala and hippocampus. From an aromatherapist's perspective these are some of the most important connections in the olfactory system because they potentially enable odors to influence cognitive, emotional, endocrine and immune function 8,10, 11. Many important effects are exerted through the pyriform cortex's connections to the hypothalamus because it is through this route that action potentials initiated at the receptors gain access to the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenocortical axis and are able to affect the production of stress hormones and other markers of stress that arise when the axis is activated by the Fight or Flight response 14,17, 18.Another very important projection site for the olfactory tract is the olfactory tubercle. It projects to the amygdala and orbitofrontal cortex and regulates the release of dopamine, the so-called \"pleasure chemical,\" in response to both odors and sounds and hence plays a role in determining choices that are influenced by odor cues, such as mating behavior. It is also possibly involved in the establishment of addictive behaviors. The destinations to which olfactory signals travel indicate that they potentially have the ability to exert some very important effects and numerous studies have, in fact, shown that inhalation of essential oils is capable of producing alterations in mood, behavior, cognition and physiological functioning 2, 4, 7, 10, 13. Since these studies were not generally designed to control for effects of inhaled essential oils acting through the Blood Pathway they don't provide rigorous evidence for olfactory effects (even though some of the authors attribute their results to such effects), but they are representative of what kinds of actions can at least theoretically be produced by olfactory stimulation alone. Summing up the findings from studies cited here and many others too numerous to cite, it can be concluded that because of the anatomical connections between the olfactory receptors and the limbic, autonomic, immune and endocrine systems inhaled essential oils are at least theoretically able to exert a wide range of actions solely through stimulation of the olfactory nerve and have the potential to: affect mood and behavior exert anxiolytic effects decrease agitation and aggression affect arousal and alertness It's Just a Smell continuedSummer 2015.2 NAHA's Aromatherapy Journal41 \u00a9 Copyright 2015 NAHA affect cognitive performance induce relaxation or sleep affect the perception of pain signals affect sex drive improve immune function affect endocrine function, especially stress hormones. By understanding the neural basis for the demonstrated actions of inhaled essential oils it is possible to speculate that there are potentially many applications for aromatherapy in the treatment of mood and behavioral disorders and some neurological diseases. In my own practice I have capitalized on my understanding of the olfactory system by using inhaled essential oils in managing some cases of agitation, mood disorder, learning problems, panic attacks, seizures and stress-related problems.

Botany: Lemongrass is a veritable botanical fountain with its cascading strands of aromatic, lime-green leaves. It lends a tropical flair to the herb garden and ornamental herb containers alike. Lemongrass tea is widely used throughout the tropics as a home remedy for insomnia, anxiety, fevers and colds and flu. The pale yellow stem core is a popular spice in Southeast Asian cuisine, featured prominently in many Thai curries and soups. Clumping Tender Herbaceous Perennial: Native to south India and Sri Lanka; cultivated throughout the tropics as a medicinal and culinary herb. Zones: Deciduous perennial Zones 8\u20149; evergreen grass in Zones 10\u201411; grown as an annual or potted plant in colder regions; full sun to partial shade. Soil: pH 5-7.8; prefers fertile, moist, yet well-drained loam but will grow in sandy or clay soils that are amended with organic matter. Size: 3' - 6' tall; 2' - 4' wide. Propagation: Typically grown from division, rather than seed. Dig up individual stems or small clumps from the mother plant, cut off the tops, and plant out the remaining 8\"-10\" long bases. Take care to not plant the stems too deep. You can often obtain pieces of lemongrass stem, with attached roots, from Asian grocers. These can be directly planted in pots or encouraged to root in a glass of water before planting. When starting from seed, sow shallowly. Germination takes two to three weeks at 70 \u00b0F. Low germination rates are common. Most of the lemongrass seed in commerce is C. flexuosus, and I suspect that much of the seed sold as C. citratus is mislabeled, and is actually C. flexuosus as well. C. citratus is typically sold as a plant, rather than seed, because its flowering is erratic and many of its seeds are infertile. Malabar lemongrass ( C. flexuosus), also called East Indian lemongrass, has similar medicinal and culinary uses as C. citratus , and is considered interchangeable as an herb. Lemongrass by Juliet Blankespoor Cymbopogon NAHA Lemongrass continued Cultivation: Lemongrass is a prominent tropical culinary and medicinal herb and is widely planted outside its native range both on a commercial scale (primarily for its essential oil) and in home gardens. In the subtropics, light freezes cause the foliage to die back over the winter and re-emerge in spring. In frost-free areas, lemongrass reaches dramatic proportions of 6' in height and 4' wide. Once lemongrass is established, its compact form keeps weeds at bay. The leaves have jagged edges, so take care when harvesting or caring for the plants. Lemongrass can be harvested repeatedly throughout the growing season. Depending on your climate you may be able to obtain three to five cuttings. Even though lemongrass is typically grown from division, the seeds aren't too tricky to germinate. Like most folks, I had always grown lemongrass from dividing the roots, so the first time I planted it from seed, I fancied myself some sort of greenhouse alchemist, and took great delight in the miraculous sight of emerging tiny grass blades. It takes longer to establish harvestable plants when starting from seed. See my notes in the propagation section on species identity with purchased seed. Lemongrass is often planted around outdoor spaces in the hope that it will repel mosquitoes, but I think the idea somewhat fanciful, as the breeze doesn't release enough of the essential oil to deter hungry, persistent bloodsuckers. However, I think it is effective to burn lemongrass essential oil in a diffuser or add the oil to a natural insect repellent blend. In the garden, lemongrass is planted as a companion plant to deter pests; its essential oil repels insects while masking the scents of other plants. Rows of lemongrass are inter-planted in Australian fruit orchards to minimize pest challenges while providing an extra source of income. The vegetation also serves as an insecticidal and antimicrobial mulch. In the temperate world, lemongrass can be grown as an annual in the ground or in containers. It can then be coddled indoors over the winter as a potted plant, preferably in a south-facing window. When my aim is to overwinter the plant, I place it in a NAHA Lemongrass continued pot on a sunny porch, as it's convenient to cut back the foliage and haul indoors before the first frost. Lemongrass also plays a leading role in my large mixed container plantings every year. Its commanding stature is contrasted beautifully by the deep hues of purple sage and the perky white and green coloration of variegated thyme and tricolored sage. For a tropical flair, pair lemongrass with nasturtium and other cascading flowers. Problem Insects and Diseases: Rabbits are fond of tender young lemongrass, and spider mites can infest indoor plants. In tropical areas, lemongrass rust ( Puccinia nakanishikii) affects plants, causing yellow spots and brown streaks on leaves. Remove diseased growth and mulch heavily to minimize the splashing of spores from the dirt onto plants. Lemongrass as Medicine Part Used: Leaves and stem.Preparation: Hot or iced infusion, infused oil, curry paste, essential Actions: Diaphoretic, carminative, world, lemongrass is a popular beverage tea and everyday home remedy for some of the most common health complaints: headaches, stress, indigestion, insomnia, coughs, colds and flu. In Brazil, the tea is a popular remedy for anxiety and insomnia. Lemongrass is combined with ginger in Jamaica to treat headaches, intestinal gas, and stress. In Ayurvedic medicine, lemongrass is used to aid digestion, relieve menstrual cramps and expectorate phlegm. Much of the research conducted on lemongrass has centered on the essential oil, which has demonstrated marked anti-bacterial and anti- fungal properties. I like to pair lemongrass with other citrus-y herbs, like lemon balm lemongrass and ginger ( Zingiber officinale ) tea, sweetened with a touch of honey and soured with a slice of lemon, is quite lovely to sip after a heavy meal, and also aids digestion. Lemongrass can be added to bitter tasting fever herbs, like (Achillea millefolium ) and their flavor. Culinary: Lemongrass is an integral spice in many Southeast Asian dishes. The base of the stalks is the main portion used in cooking. Peel off the fibrous outer layers at the very base of the stem to get to the tender inner layers\u2014this aromatic delicacy can be finely minced and added to curries and soups. Alternately, bruise a few stems to release the juices, fashion a small bundle with baker's twine, and add to soups or brothy curry dishes. When using the entire stem, take care to remove before serving, as lemongrass has unpleasant raspy edges that irritate the throat. When harvesting your own lemongrass stalks for cooking, cut off the blades (upper grassy portions) and dry for tea or use immediately. They have a milder flavor than the base, but can also be used to flavor dishes. A small handful of the blades can be tied in a knot, added to simmering soups, and removed before serving. Related Species: Other notable members in the same genus are citronella ( C. nardus) and palmarosa (C. martinii ), both of which are widely used as essential oils. 46 Aromatherapy Journal Summer 2015.2 \u00a9 Copyright 2015 NAHA Cautions: Individuals who have reacted to lemongrass essential oil may develop an allergic contact dermatitis handling the fresh plant. The essential oil must be properly diluted before coming in contact with the skin.

The Chestnut School of Herbal MedicineSummer 2015.2 NAHA's Aromatherapy , also known as Sagebrush, covers over 422,000 square miles in the West of the United States. If there has ever been a plant that defines a place through its presence, this is it. Sagebrush is a humble, fragile-appearing plant, yet a tough survivor in a harsh, dry climate, where very few other plants (or animals) are able to survive and in which it has become the dominant species. Although the silver green upper branches and small leaves (which look like three-pointed teeth, thus the name tri-dentata) atop the gnarly, frayed-barked stems have a dynamic upward whirl shape, especially when waving playfully in the enduring fierce spring winds, the plant overall appears fragile and humble and no taller than three feet (at least in New Mexico). And yet, above it rises its powerful, towering, invisible presence. This plant reminds us that only a very powerful spirit can afford to incarnate in such a fragile form. I see the same apparently fragility and hidden power in my patients, seemingly fragile, yet powerful beings, invisible to themselves and others. Sagebrush is known about, but not widely used, in the herbal and aromatherapy fields and deserves more of our attention. About the Great Desert Sage: A member of the Asteraceae plant family, Great Desert Sage inhabits the cold desert, steppe and mountain habitat of the Intermountain West of North America. A perennial, it is the dominant plant across the Great Basin covering 422,000 square miles in the West and tolerates moderate cold. Native Americans used it to prevent wound infections, stop internal bleeding, headaches and colds, and also for smudging. The stems make good friction sticks for making fires. It is a wind pollinator and thrives on very poor soil, it is drought tolerant, and it cannot grow in the shade, requiring the bright light of the western skies. Sagebrush is in the genus Artemisia and it is related to the plant used to make Absinthe, grand wormwood (Artemisia absinthium) . 5%), -terpinene (up to 12%), d-camphor, and others. I recently had an opportunity to share the essential oil of Sagebrush at a class I was teaching in Detroit and I asked participants, who had no prior experience or knowledge of Sagebrush, what their intuitive impressions of the scent were. The descriptions by participants included \" bold, intoxication, brown-green, masculine, awakening, silver bells, silver needle stitching up a wound, weaving, fabric, sacred earth dance, mountain lion, large expanses, solar plexus, turtle 48 Aromatherapy Journal Summer 2015.2 \u00a9 Copyright 2015 NAHAweaver, canyon, blue sky, still focus and intent, chest-centered, heart-centered, circulates around brain, home, constant, depth of place, sense of comfort, reminds me of what's real, brought back my wandering mind, giddy, a comforting lightness, makes me want to giggle, white, feathers, rush of birds, childhood memories, symbol of warning, purifying, disinfectant, abrasive at first but deeply cleansing, spunky, sweeter over time.\" To me this shows that our sense of smell can allow us to intuitively connect with the spirit of the plant, if we are careful not to let the \"left-brain\" and book knowledge predetermine our experience and if we don't confuse the wisdom of direct experience with the intellectual knowledge. Both direct, intuitive experience and book knowledge are important, but wisdom emerges from the synthesis of both. This experience also showed me that sagebrush can communicate its properties to people that are not familiar with it and live in a different environment, where sagebrush doesn't grow. 1 st Chakra (Survival), 3rd Chakra (Power), 5th Chakra (Communication), 7th Chakra (Connection to Spirit).Great Desert Sage continued Great Desert NAHAPersonality: Fragile yet durable, humble yet invited to remember its vast invisible presence and spirit.

I was first introduced to this fabulous plant at their farm, Purple Haze Lavender in Sequim, Washington. It was the second plant that I had the pleasure to distill; I fell in love immediately. Growing an untested botanical -in a new location-for essential oil or hydrosol production is a labor of love. Most botanicals need a maturation period, meaning you may not be able to begin distilling for two to three years. Until you can distill and test your oil or hydrosol you have no idea whether the chemistry will be desirable, the terroir may change the chemistry for better or worse. To put that into perspective, all the labor of seeding, planting, weeding, watering, and nurturing for three years may all be for naught if the chemistry isn't correct. It is much like playing the lottery; only the payout is three or more years down the road. I have the utmost respect for farmers that are willing to put in the time and resources to test new botanicals or known botanicals in new locations. I personally know of at least seven farms now growing and distilling Helichrysum in the Pacific Northwest and California. My personal experience has been a roller coaster; my growing zone is technically too cold for Helichrysum. In 2005 I purchased good stock plants and began my journey in eastern Washington. The plant grew well here in my sandy loam; we have hot, dry summers and it thrived. In 2008 I sent off my first essential oil and hydrosol for testing and was very pleased with the results; a 30.86% Neryl acetate was promising. Unfortunately, the winter of 2010 was devastating to the plants and I lost all of them. Thus began my journey of finding farms in warmer zones to grow the plants for me. Helichrysum (Helichrysum italicum) \u00a9 Ann Harman52 Aromatherapy U.S. Grown Helichrysum italicum continued GCMS Analyses of Helichrysum Essential Oils I have compiled five GCMS analyses of essential oil from different farms and locations in the United States; only the main components are listed as the complete analyses have over 130 components. I think you will agree that the domestic Helichrysum can hold its own in its chemistry. As you can see in Table 1 the Neryl acetate ranges from a low of 30.86% to a high of 46.94%. This is comparable to a Corsican Helichrysum italicum although the Diones are lower in percentage than the typical Corsican Helichrysum. The Dione percentage is actually more representative of the Croatian essential oils. Table 1: Comparison of Five United States Helichrysum Essential Oil GCMS Analyses 2013 2000 2009 2009 Lot# CHI1058, 90820, 90853 and 80838 all came from cuttings from the same original stock plants; they were grown in different locations and planted in different years. It is interesting to note the differences in 90820 and 98053. These two analyses are from an experiment I did in 2009. The distillation of 90820 was the flowers only of the Helichrysum and the distillation of 90853 was from the same farm and harvest date but was in fact both the flowers and leaf. The yield of distillation 90853 was nearly double that of the flower only distillation. GCMS Analyses of Helichrysum Now that we have some idea of the chemistry of our domestic Helichrysum essential oils, let's take a closer look at a Helichrysum hydrosol; I Summer 2015.2 NAHA's Aromatherapy Journal53 \u00a9 Copyright 2015 NAHA can tell you it is quite lovely to experience. The plants for these analyses came from the same stock as mentioned above and are grown on a biodynamic farm in southern California. Before we look at the chemistry of the hydrosol we must first understand how to read a GCMS of a hydrosol as it needs some mathematical conversions before it is comparable. Hydrosols contain less than 1% volatile components and as such a GCMS of a hydrosol measures the volatiles in relation to each other, not as a percentage of the entire hydrosol. In order to convert these percentages to a percentage of the entire hydrosol we have to do some math. We first calculate how many mg/L of volatiles there are in the entire hydrosol. In the analysis below (Table 2) it is 176 or 0.0176% of the hydrosol. We then multiply the percentage of the component by the mg/L and we get very close to a Parts Per Million (PPM) measurement. I say very close because a mg (milligram) is 1/1000,000 th of a liter of water; most essential oils weigh less than water, that is why they separate. For our purposes, however, using PPM is close enough for our calculations. To find the percentage of the component in the entire hydrosol you would then divide the PPM by 10,000 (see Table 2).U.S. Grown Helichrysum italicum continued Table 2: How to Convert the Percentage of a Component to mg/L To convert the percentage of a component to mg/L (ppm) of entire hydrosol, you would follow these steps: P(ppm)= mg/L of volatiles x P (%) of component} 1. Take the total mg/L of essential oil (for this example I am using 176 mg/L - This number comes from the GCMS analysis and is specific for each sample) 2. Multiply the total mg/L of volatiles by the percentage (25.02%) of component: (176 x 25.02%) = 44mg/L(ppm) To convert the percentage of a component to a percentage of the entire hydrosol, you would follow these steps: {Formula: P (%) of entire hydrosol = P (ppm) \u00f7 10000} 1. Find the mg/L (ppm) of the component (see above) 2. Divide the mg/L of the component by 10,000: 44 \u00f7 Copyright 2015 NAHA Table 3: Comparsion of (176mg/L of in relation to other volatilesPercentage in the entire hydrosolPercentage range in the The relationship of chemical families is quite different in the hydrosol. We can see in Table 3 that the hydrosol is composed mainly of Monterpenols and Ketones, specifically the various Diones and a small percentage of Esters. The representative essential oils were composed mainly of Monoterpenes, Sesquiterpenes, Esters, and Ketones. It is exciting to see such positive analyses on the U.S. grown Helichrysum. I will continue to experiment and analyze these different batches from farms in the Pacific Northwest and California. And I expect as the plants mature and thrive we will continue to get encouraging results. Perhaps one day we will have a robust Helichrysum industry right here in the U.S.!

With this in mind many reach for a cure-all to try and help every little thing from a runny nose, to a small fever, to cuts and scrapes. While discovery of a cure-all is probably fairly far off in the distance what we do have are components that, when used appropriately and in a safe manner, may assist many symptoms. The key is taking safety guidelines seriously and remembering that little ones do not have body systems that are fully mature. Some Guidelines When Using Essential Oils Near Children2 Do not allow children to ingest essential oils. Do not add undiluted essential oils to the bathwater of children. Keep essential oils out of reach of children. If possible, purchase bottles of essential oils with child-resistant caps. Do not apply essential oils to or near a child's face. Do not place essential oils or blends containing essential oils into the nose of a child. Do not expose children of five years or less to strong essential oil vapors.58 Aromatherapy Journal Summer 2015.2 \u00a9 Copyright 2015 NAHA Currently, safety data may just show a reason to avoid topical use for certain essential oils (and is listed as such in the following lists). My personal recommendation, for added safety, would be to avoid all of the essential oils listed. Newborn Babies (Newborn to Three Months Old) The general consensus in this age group is to avoid all direct essential oil use, be that topical application or direct inhalation. This is due to the immaturity of the body systems in newborns as \"fresh from the oven\" their little bodies are not prepped to deal with the strength of essential oils. While complete avoidance is probably not always possible we come to realize that some indirect inhalation can generally be regarded as safe. Infant/ Early Toddler (Three Months Old to Two Years Old) Within this age span the body systems have be - gun to mature but are still vulnerable. As such some topical applications can be used. The generally considered safe essential oils for this age group are Lavender ( Lavandula angus- tifolia ( Melaleuca alternifolia). These three essential oils can be remembered by thinking of the acronym TLC, with the C being Chamomile, Roman. Of course with this short list comes a very small recommendation for dilution rate, a mere 0.25% with a maxi - mum recommendation of 0.5%.2 A dilution of these rates would be set at one to three drops of essential oil per ounce of carrier. Also, essential oils use in a diffuser can be achieved with the general guideline of having the diffuser on for fifteen minutes in the room prior to the child's arrival and turning it off once they are in the room. If irritation occurs discontinue use.Toddler/ Early Childhood (Two Years Old to Five Years Old) Once children reach the age of two their systems have continued to mature beyond that of infancy, and known medical problems have often started. For example by age two we have a better idea if they have known allergies, or asthma, and what may cause these. This allows us to be better equipped to decide which essential oils may be safe for them. Specifically though, there are still essential oils (see next page) that are not recommended for safety reasons. For this age group both direct application and direct inhalation are considered safe for limited use. The safe dilution ratio for this age group is recommended at one percent or five to six drops of essential oil in one ounce of carrier with a maximum of two percent or ten to twelve drops of essential oil in one ounce of carrier. 2 For use in a diffuser it is safest to run for thirty minutes on with at least an hour off before turning it back on. If irritation occurs discontinue use. The essential oils that are known to be safe with this age group are: 3 Lavender (Lavandula angustifolia) Roman Chamomile (Chamaemelum NAHA's Aromatherapy Journal59 \u00a9 Copyright 2015 NAHASafe Essential Oil Use with Children continued Basil (Ocimum basilicum) - avoid use of all basil chemotpes via all routes.

Specific details on essential oils can be found in Tisserand and Young's Essential Oil Safety.2Essential Oils to Avoid with Children Under Five Years Old After seeing the above lists your reaction is probably similar to seeing the list of essential oils to avoid during pregnancy and lactation. The good news is that when using essential oils not listed above, along with proper and safe dilution guidelines, many essential oils still can be used to assist little ones. Just remember to refer to the initial guidelines given at the start of this article for each age group.Summer 2015.2 NAHA's Aromatherapy Journal61 \u00a9 Copyright 2015 NAHAIn conclusion we find that aromatherapy can be a very useful addition to the wellness toolkit for families with children. However, essential oils, like medicine, have a time and place for use and the user should always factor in the safe level at which they can be used. By taking into account the specific child and their needs parents and professionals will be best able to assist the child. References: 1) Worwood, V. (2000).

For me this means that each evening or early morning until sometime in November I will be harvesting these little scented wonders and placing them into a mason jar filled with 190 proof, organic grape alcohol or a bed of fat. These are ancient processes, known as tincturing and a modern type of enfleurage. Tincturing is most often done to extract medicinal components. As a botanical perfumer, I do this for the purpose of scent and to harness some of the Venusian aspects that jasmine is revered for. Although very feminine, jasmine is considered the King of aromatics in perfume with rose as the Queen. These two flowers, along with tube - rose, were the first to be cultivated for perfum - ery in France. The jasmine genus contains over 200 species including vines and shrubs. \"Ah, these jasmines, these white jasmines!...\" ~ Excerpt from: The First Jasmines by Rabindranath Tagore Although the common name for the sambac species is Arabian jasmine this gem, with her small, white, waxy petals, is native to the tropical regions of Southeast Asia, not the arid climes of the Middle East. Despite this fact, the plant grows quite well for me here in southern California during the warmer months. Since I am located on the hillside where clay soil and gophers abound, I put the Jasmine sambacs in pots; so far I have fifteen and counting. A girl can never have too many jasmine plants! The uses of the small flowers extend to flavoring green, pouchong and jasmine tea; in Hawaii it is called Pikake and used in fragrant leis, while in India the flowers are used for devotional garlands of hope. There is an old saying by the great masters of French perfumery stating, \"Never a perfume without Jasmine.\" This is so true, as this fragrance pairs beautifully with other florals like rose odorata ) while marrying well with so many other fragrance families to produce feminine, masculine and/or unisex fragrances. The pairing of two or more ingredients in perfumery is called an accord or chord, a term stemming from music, meaning \"a harmonious combination of two or more notes.\" 1 In the palette of the natural, botanical perfumer we Jasmine (Jasminum sambac) enfleurage \u00a9 Roxana Journal Summer 2015.2 \u00a9 Copyright 2015 NAHA tend to work , Jasmin for Jasmin sambac). These heavenly aromatics all have an opulent, intoxicating, heady, exotic, complex, sweet and floral fragrance with varying subtleties. In perfume they are considered mid to base notes with strong aromatic strength. Jasmin grandiforum : termed \"Poet's jasmine,\" this is the most elegant and traditional jasmine of all three types. The fragrance is refined opulence with fresh, floral notes. The main chemical constituent is the \"monoterpene farnesene with benzyl scent paired with strong animalic, indole notes. Jasmin sambac: Strong fresh, green, fruity and herbaceous notes compared to the others with an air of mystery. The essence contains some animalic and indole notes not present in the fresh flowers. In aromatherapy we view jasmine as an aphrodisiac, used in wedding and sensual blends. The essence is also used extensively for the reproductive system. The attributes of jasmine are: calming, restorative and uplifting with its elemental being water. Since my plants are so plentiful, I often make both a tincture and a pomade, or a cold enfleurage which can be added to body butters. Each morning or late evening, as a daily meditation, I gather the small flowers from the plants and place them in alcohol or a prepared base of beeswax and jojoba oil. For the tincture, I leave the little flowers until they appear lifeless; for the pomade, I remove the spent flowers within twenty-four hours. I repeat this process until the base matter has absorbed enough of the aroma. Usually around mid July the jasmine harvest is in full swing. At that point I begin harvesting them in the evening when the heat is not as intense but the blossoms are freshly opened with their intoxicating fresh floral perfume. The word intoxicating is defined as \"causing great happiness.\" I can't think of a better descriptor for jasmine sambac flowers! How to Make a Tincture or a Pomade Begin with freshly opened, dry flowers. If you are making a tincture, use a clean glass Harnessing the Soul of Jasmine continued Jasmine (Jasminum 2015 NAHA jar with a tight fitting lid. Fill the jar with a high proof alcohol and add your fresh, DRY flowers each day. Discard the spent flowers every few days or so. Over time the alcohol will turn a deep golden yellow color and contain a \"thick\" quality. Depending on the alcohol you are using, the scent of the jasmine will be perceived best once the alcohol evaporates on the skin. I find that the tincture is also wonderful to add to beverages. To make the pomade the ritual is the same, except for the day old flowers will need to be removed every twenty-four hours. I suggest storing both the tincture and the pomade in a dry, cool place during the process. References: 1 Williams, David G. Perfumes of Yesterday, Michelle Press Williams, 2004.2 Shutes, Jade.

Full and personal support by Sharon Falsetto CA, BA (Hons) Summer 2015.2 NAHA's Aromatherapy Journal67 Ph.D. by Sharon Falsetto This NAHA Journal's interview is with a long- time voice in the aromatherapy community - and host of the upcoming 8th Scientific Wholistic Aromatherapy Conference in San Francisco, California in November 2015: Kurt Schnaubelt Ph.D. Whether you are new to aromatherapy, or an experienced professional in the industry, I hope that you might learn something new about essential oils, or Kurt Schnaubelt, in this interview! A big thank you to Kurt who took time out of his very busy schedule to answer my questions. You have been involved with aromatherapy and essential oils for a long time. What inspired you to start your journey? In 1978, I happened to read Robert Tisserand's The Art of Aromatherapy . Quite the budding scientist I had my doubts about many of the claims that seemed terribly unsubstantiated. Since I was finishing my doctoral thesis at the time I had access to academic search capabilities - an early version of the internet. Much to my surprise there was a fair amount of scientific experimentation exploring the pharmacological properties of plant constituents. Finding all this fascinating I ordered some essential oils and their magic has never left me. Since you first founded The Pacific Institute of Aromatherapy , what noticeable changes have you seen in the area of aromatherapy and essential oils?One aspect of aromatherapy that has not changed is the quest for more scientific validation. This has long played out in the back and forth between French and British styles of aromatherapy. Because it is virtually impossible to patent essential oils, large corporate interest has stayed away from essential oils and the mom-and-pop nature of the industry has persisted for a long time. Aspects of French and British styles have hence become integrated into an American or, if you will, a global style of aromatherapy. Clearly the big change on foot right now is the emergence of corporate Multi-level Marketing (MLM) players in aromatherapy. Their need to sensationalize and simplify has taken center stage. While some may lament this development, it also familiarizes many individuals with essential oils, who would otherwise not have been exposed to them at all. You have written several books on aromatherapy, one of which - Advanced Aromatherapy: The Science of Essential Oil Therapy - covers the subject of chemistry in greater detail. What advice would you give to new students of aromatherapy in trying to understand this difficult subject area? If one approaches aromatherapy as a lay person many questions arise, to a large degree because we are conditioned to believe that all conventional medicine is based on sound scientific evidence. As a result there is a desire 68 Aromatherapy Journal Summer 2015.2 \u00a9 Copyright 2015 NAHA to articulate the qualities of aromatherapy in a language similar to that of conventional medicine: it instills trust. What my book Advanced Aromatherapy does is not so much as teach the student the precise ins and outs of chemistry, but instead to present the chemical terminology used in the scientific classification of essential oils. It introduces the basic arguments about the pharmacological properties of essential oils and thereby attempts to create some familiarity with this language and consequently the subject. It leaves it to the reader how much deeper one decides to investigate the basics of chemistry. If you could only choose one essential oil, which essential oil do you think is most useful for beginners to aromatherapy - and why? Clearly the essential oil most useful for beginners would have to be lavender (Lavandula angustifolia), not only for its may possible applications and inherent safety, but also, because nearly everyone has a concept of this plant whether one knows it as an essential oil or not. However, I would like to go past the one essential oil limitation for a moment: Essential oils are an expression of the rather incredible diversity of plant life and for me to suggest one essential oil to start exploring such diversity is practically impossible. I believe that the most valuable benefits of aromatherapy can be discovered by playful exploration of a variety of essential oils. Juxtaposing essential oils of different character, i.e. lavender (Lavandula angustifolia) and anise seed (Pimpinella anisum) or a precious floral with tea tree (Melaleuca alternifolia) is a good way to build an appreciation for the diversity of aromatic plants.Do have an interesting tip or story to share from your travels and search for the best producers of authentic essential oils? Being able to search for authentic essential oils is quite a privilege. Probably the most simple and succinct recommendation for the search for authentic essential oils I received from Rodolphe Balz (author of The Healing Power of Essential Oils ), one of the early pioneers of aromatherapy. His statement was to look for the plant inventory, i.e. stands of wild or cultivated plants and the still. If one cannot find or see the plants and/or the still where they are distilled, the odds are an essential oil is not authentic. That being said, there is one fact I have experienced time and again. Meeting the distiller/producer who proudly displays his plants and his still is a much better guarantee for authenticity than all the GC- MS chromatograms in the world. Generally adulteration does not arise at the level of the individuals working the land. It arises when industrial exploitation seeks to lower cost. Why is it important for people to know and understand the source of their essential oils? If we allow that the complexity of essential oils is the source of more and deeper healing qualities than can be expressed by reductionist evaluation of some main components, then the source, meaning the specific environment, in which a plant and its essential oil arises, becomes an important factor in the healing powers of a specific oil. We intuitively support this idea by being drawn to essential oils from artisanal sources. It is for this reason that the giant agro-business does not market its products by showing its large-scale livestock farming but bucolic scenes with happy people eating fresh foods.Interview Copyright 2015 NAHA In the world of essential oils the huge demands of the corporate giants forces them to consider more industrial oils as the available stocks of the original authentic products become exhausted. This is also the reason why essential oils analysis has been played up so much as a marketing tool. While analysis easily detects gross adulteration it really cannot prove authenticity. Instead it depersonalizes an essential oil. Instead of characteristics we can smell or see we start to trust the numbers of the print out. As long as the components are right and are present in somewhat acceptable proportions an essential oil is now considered to be of high quality. And such an essential oil will, most likely, still deliver its basic pharmacological properties to some degree. But its most exquisite qualities, those we sometimes characterize with words such as magic, those are gone. Fine wine is a perfect example for the above described situation. Practically no one purchases a bottle of Napa Valley Reserve Cabernet and then has it analyzed. The name of the producer and the origin of the grapes from a specific vineyard guarantee quality and uniqueness of the wine. The same is true for essential oils: dedicated small producers make much more expressive essential oils than combine harvesting and gigantic stills ever can. Do you have any advice for those considering a career in aromatherapy in today's climate? To envision a career in aromatherapy one probably, then as now, has to be driven by a deep passion for plant life and the quest for truly holistic healing. In the past a good knowledge of chemistry was helpful to navigate the science surrounding essential oils. A background in one of the healing arts or in beauty made it easier to find a vehicle by which to offer aromatherapy to the public. In the early 21st century the rise of biology and especially molecular biology are likely candidates to show the way to new avenues of essential oil applications. Finally, tell us a little bit about the upcoming 8 th Scientific Wholistic Aromatherapy Conference in San Francisco in November 2015, for those who may not have heard about it. The Pacific Institute of Aromatherapy's 8th international aromatherapy conference showcases the incredible development aromatherapy as a healing art has taken. In the past, topics centered around infectious disease and relaxation. The scientific contributions will highlight new frontiers such as the still grossly underestimated capacity of essential oils to benefit cancer patients, their ability to manage pain, and an entirely updated understanding of the safety of essential oil application. Presentations from the community will introduce new treatment possibilities for postoperative lymphedema management or Interview with Kurt Schnaubelt, Ph.D. continued Population Lavender \u00a9 Kurt Schnaubelt, PhD70 Aromatherapy Journal Summer 2015.2 \u00a9 Copyright 2015 NAHA Lyme disease among many others and also important cultural aspects such as a Japanese incense ceremony. Overall it should be a jubilant celebration of what aromatherapy represents and can do in the early 21st century, with some of the truly significant contributors in attendance.

Cheryl Hoard served two terms (each term a period of three years) as NAHA President from 1994-2000. During her time in office NAHA grew nationally, and educational standards were set into place. She improved the NAHA aromatherapy journal and employed NAHA's first part time employee. Cheryl also organized two highly successful international aromatherapy conferences: The World of Aromatherapy II (1998) and V (2004). Throughout her work with NAHA, Cheryl shined as a leader. Her compassion and commitment is most memorable.Cheryl was an early pillar in the aromatherapy community and she had an incredible impact in the field of aromatherapy during her years of service. Most importantly, she was a pillar in her own community. She did not seek fame or fortune, but shared her passion and commitment to those directly around her through her work with her store: Cheryl's Herbs. She had a deep sense of compassion and she was always squarely centered in her core. Her work ethic was impeccable. She was proud to serve NAHA and we are eternally grateful for all that she accomplished as President.
