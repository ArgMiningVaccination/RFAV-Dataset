Home remedies may or may not have actual [medicinal properties](/index.php/Medicinal_properties) that serve to treat or cure the disease or ailment in question, as they are typically passed along by laypersons (which has been facilitated in recent years by the [Internet](/index.php?title=Internet&action=edit&redlink=1)).; many are merely used as a result of [tradition](/index.php?title=Tradition&action=edit&redlink=1) or [habit](/index.php/Habituation) or because they are quite effective in inducing the [placebo effect](/index.php/Placebo_effect). A significant number, however, have been demonstrated to effectively treat ailments such as [sprains](/index.php/Sprain), minor [lacerations](/index.php/Laceration), [headaches](/index.php/Headache), [fevers](/index.php/Fever), and even the [common cold](/index.php/Common_cold). One of the more popular examples of a home remedy is the use of [chicken soup](/index.php?title=Chicken_soup&action=edit&redlink=1) to treat [respiratory](/index.php/Respiratory_system) [infections](/index.php/Infection) such as a cold or mild [flu](/index.php/Flu), and according to recent studies, this may actually be effective. [[1]](#cite_note-1) Other examples of medically successful home remedies include: [willow](/index.php/Willow) bark tea to cure headaches and fevers (willow bark contains a form of [acetylsalicylic acid](/index.php/Acetylsalicylic_acid), also known as aspirin); [duct tape](/index.php?title=Duct_tape&action=edit&redlink=1) to help with setting broken bones; and or superglue to treat [plantar warts](/index.php/Plantar_wart), and [Kogel mogel](/index.php?title=Kogel_mogel&action=edit&redlink=1) to treat sore throat. In earlier times mothers were entrusted with all but serious remedies. Historic [cookbooks](/index.php?title=Cookbooks&action=edit&redlink=1) are frequently full of remedies for dyspepsia, fevers and female complaints. [[2]](#cite_note-2) Many of the European [liqueurs](/index.php?title=Liqueurs&action=edit&redlink=1) or [digestifs](/index.php?title=Digestif&action=edit&redlink=1) were originally medicinal remedies. In Chinese folk medicine, medicinal [congees](/index.php?title=Congee&action=edit&redlink=1) (long cooked rice soups with herbs), foods and soups are part of the healing repertoire. [[3]](#cite_note-3) A common error is to confuse home remedies with [homeopathic remedies](/index.php/Homeopathy). In fact, the two concepts are unrelated.
