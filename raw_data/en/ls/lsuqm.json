Emergenc y care In the even t of an emergency , go immediatel y to the emergenc y room of the nearest hospital . If you believ e your situation is particularl y severe , call 911 for assistance. A medica l emergenc y is typicall y thought of as a medical or psychiatric condition in which symptom s are so severe, that the absenc e of immediat e medical attention could place one's healt h in seriou s jeopardy . Most times , a hospital emergenc y room is not the most appropriat e place for you to be treated. Hospital emergenc y room s provide emergenc y care and must prioritiz e patients' needs . The most seriousl y hurt or ill patient s are treate d first. If you are not in that category , you could wait a long time. 4 Urgen t Care Urgent care is necessar y treatment for a non-life-threatening, unexpected illness or accidental injury that requires prompt medica l attentio n when your docto r is unavailable. Examples include sore throat , fever , sinus infection, ear ache, cuts, rashes , sprains , and broke n bones. You may visit an urgent care center which offers a convenient , safe, and affordable treatment alternativ e to emergenc y room care when you can't get an appointment with your own doctor. Retai l healt h clinic Retail healt h clinic s are anothe r alternativ e when you can't get an appointment with your own docto r for non-emergenc y care. Retail healt h clinic s use certified nurse practitioner s who treat minor , uncomplicated illnes s or injury . Some retail health clinic s may also offer flu shots and vaccinations.

Take a look at the advantages: Easy to use. A national network of retail pharmacies will recogniz e and accep t your member identification (ID) card. Low out-of-pocke t expenses. When you use a participating pharmacy, your out-of-pocket costs are based on a discounte d price, fixed copaym ents, or coinsur ance. No paperwor k. You don't have to file a claim form or wait for reimbursement when you use a participating pharmacy. High level of safet y. When you fill a prescription at a participating pharmacy , your pharmac y can identif y harmful drug interaction s and other danger s by viewin g your drug history. For maintenanc e drugs needed to treat ongoing or chronic conditions - Home deliver y. Your progra m may allow you to receiv e drugs right at your door when ordered throug h the mail order service, eliminati ng time spent waitin g in line at the pharmac y counter. - Mail order purchase s allow you to get a larger suppl y of drugs than what might be available to you at the retail pharmacy .

How to fill your prescriptio n at a retail pharmacy Present your ID card and your prescription at a FutureScript s participating pharmac y for your plan.

Find a pharmacy Visit www.futurescripts.com or call 1-888-678-7012. 9 Brand vs. Generic Generic drugs are as effective as brand drugs and could save you money. However, consult your doctor to find out which drug type is best for you. Participatin g pharmacies A pharmac y is considered participating if it is in the FutureScript s pharmacy network for your plan. The Futur eScript s networ k includes more than 65,000 retail pharmacies . When you'r e traveling, you will find that most of the pharmacies in all 50 states accept your ID card and can fill your prescription for the same cost you pay at home, if you use a participatin g pharmacy. There is no need to selec t just one pharmac y to fill your prescriptio n needs. To locate a participating pharmacy , visit www.futurescripts.com or call FutureScript s at 1-888-678-7012. Non-participatin g pharmacies If your prescription is filled at a pharmac y that does not participat e in the FutureScript s networ k for your plan, you will have to pay the pharmacy's regular charge right at the counter . Then, dependin g on your plan design, you may submi t a claim form for partia l FutureScripts Your reimbursemen t chec k shoul d arrive within 14 days from the day your claim form is received. Keep in mind that your plan sponsor selecte d Independenc e Blue Cros s (IBC) and/or its subsidiaries based in part on the discounte d drug prices that FutureScript s has negotiated. When you use a non-particip ating pharmac y that has not agree d to charge a discounted price, it costs your plan more money ; part of that cost is passed on to you. Understandin g your prescription Bran d drugs are manufacture d by only one company , which advertises and sells its product unde r a specia l trade name. In many cases , brand drugs are quite expensive, which is why your share of the cost is higher . Generic drugs are typically manufacture d by severa l companies and are almos t alway s less expensiv e than the brand drug. Generic drugs are approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA ) to ensur e they are as safe and effectiv e as their brand counterparts . However, not every brand drug has a generic version. The Selec t Drug Program provides our member s with compre hensiv e prescription drug coverage. The Selec t Drug Program uses a formulary , which includes all generic drugs and a define d list of brand drugs that have been evaluated for their medical effectiveness , positiv e results , and value . The formular y is reviewe d quarterl y to ensur e its continued effectiveness. To check the formular y status of drugs , simpl y log onto ibxpress.com. 10 In additio n to the Selec t Drug Progra m formulary , you will also find helpfu l information on these relate d topics: Prior authorizat ion process Age and gender limits Quantit y level limits If you'r e not sure if brand or generic drugs are right for you, talk to your doctor . The pharmacis t may, on occasion, discus s with your physician whethe r an alternativ e drug might be appropriat e for you. Let your physician know if you have a questio n about a chang e in prescriptio n or if you prefer the origina l prescription. Your physician makes the final decision on the necessit y of you getting a brand drug. Certai n controlled substances and other prescribed medications may be subjec t to dispensin g limitations . If you have any questions regardin g your medication, please call 1-800-ASK-BLUE (1-800-275-2583). Preventiv e drugs for adult s and children IBC's prescriptiv e drug plans includ e 100-percent coverage for preventive medications when received from an in-networ k pharmacy . This means that you won't have to pay copays , coinsurance, or deductibles for certain preventive medications with a prescriptio n from your doctor . Receiving this preventiv e care will help you stay health y and may improv e your overall health. For a list of preventiv e drugs eligibl e for 100-percen t coverag e pleas e go to www.ibx.com or call the phon e number on the back of your ID card. Mail orde r pharmacy If your doctor has prescribe d a medicatio n that you'll need to take regularl y over a long period of time, the mail-order servic e is an excellent way to get a long-lasting suppl y and reduc e your out-of-pocket costs. Mail orde r is conveni ent and safe to use If you choos e mail order , your doctor can prescrib e a suppl y that will last up to 90 days. You can get three times as many dose s of your maintenanc e medication at one time through mail order. Mail order prescriptions have been safel y handle d through the mail for many years. When your order is received, a team of registered, licensed pharmacist s checks your prescription agains t the recor d of all drugs dispensed to you by a FutureScripts networ k pharmac y for as long as you'v e been in the IBC program administered by FutureScripts .

Make sure your doctor know s that you have a mail-order service so that you get one 90-day prescription and not three 30-day prescriptions , becaus e the cost of the three 30-day prescriptions may be more than the cost for one 90-day prescription.

The Member will be given the names, addresses and phone numbers of three BlueCard Providers. The BlueCard Program has some international locations. When the Member calls, the Member will be asked whether the Member is i nside or outside of the United States. The Member decides which Provider the Member will visit. KE 670 SG EXC HMO Gold Premier 56 The Member calls 1-800-ASK-BLUE to get prior authorization for the service from Keystone. With Keystone's approval, the Member calls the Provider to sche dule an appointment. The BlueCard Provider confirms Member eligibility.

Additional Information about the BlueCard Program Whenever the Member accesses covered healthcare services outside Keystone 's Service Area and the claim is processed through the BlueCard Program, the amount the Member pays for covered healthcare services, if not a flat dollar copayment, is calculated based on the lower of: The billed covered charges for the Member's Covered S ervices; or The negotiated price that the Host Blue makes available to Keystone. Often, this \"negotiated price\" will be a simple discount that reflects an actual price that the Host Blue provides coverage for the Member's healthcare provider. Sometimes, i t is an estimated price that takes into account special arrangements with the Member's healthcare provider or provider group that may include types of settlements, incentive payments, and/or other credits or charges. Occasionally, it may be an average pric e, based on a discount that results in expected average savings for similar types of healthcare providers after taking into account the same types of transactions as with an estimated price. KE 670 SG EXC HMO Gold Premier 57 Estimated pricing and average pricing, going forward, also take into account adjustments to correct for over -or underestimation of modifications of past pricing for the types of transaction modifications noted above. However, such adjustments will not affect the price Keystone uses for the Member's claim because they w ill not be applied retroactively to claims already paid. Laws in a small number of states may require the Host Blue to add a surcharge to the Member's calculation. If any state laws mandate other liability calculation methods, including a surcharge, we wo uld then calculate the Member's liability for any covered healthcare services according to applicable law.

Conversion If a Member or their Dependents become ineligible for coverage through their Group Progra m, they may apply for continuation of coverage in an appropriat e non -group program. The Member must reside in Keystone's five county area in order to be eligible for the n on-group HMO program. The five county area includes: Bucks, Chester, Delaware, Montgomery and Philadelphia counties. If the Member does not live in Keystone's five county area, enrollment in the HMO no n-group program is provided to the Member and their Depe ndents for 90 days from the date the Member's Group coverage ends. After this time period, the Member and their Dependents will have to convert to another plan. The Member and their Dependents may convert to the local Blue Cross\u00ae/Blue Shield\u00ae plan for the area in which they live. KE 670 SG EXC HMO Gold Premier 84 A Member's application for this conversion coverage must be made to the Health Benefit Plan within 30 days of when the M ember becomes ineligible for Group coverage. The benefits provided under the available non -group progra m may not be identical to the benefits under their Group Program. The conversion privilege is available to Members and: Their surviving Dependents, in the event of the Member's death; Their spouse, in the event of divorce; or Their child who has reached the Lim iting Age for Dependents. The Dependent must reside in Keystone's five county area in order to be eligible for the non - group HMO program. This conversion privilege is not available if the Member is terminated by the Health Benefit Plan for cause (such as deliberate misuse of an ID Card, significant misrepresentation of information that is given to the Health B enefit Plan or a Provider, or fraud). If the Member needs more information regarding their conversion privilege, call Customer Services at the tel ephone number shown on their ID Card. Should the Member choose continued coverage under COBRA (see above), they become eligible to convert to an individual, non -group plan at the end of the Member's COBRA coverage.

Confidentialit y And Disclosur e Of Medical Information The Health Benefit Plan's privacy practices, as they apply to Members enrolled in this Program, as well as a description of Members' rights to access their personal health information which may be maintained by the Health Benefit Plan, are set forth in the Health Benefit Plan's HIPAA Notice of Privacy Practices (the \"Notice\"). The Notice is sent to each new Member upon initial enrollment in this Progr am, and, subsequently, to all Members if and when the Notice is revised. By enrolling in this Program, Members give consent to the Health Benefit Plan to receive, use, maintain, and/or release their medical records, claims -related information, health and related information for the purposes identified in the Notice to the extent permitted by applicable law. However, in certain circumstances, which are more fully described in the Notice, a specific Member Authorization may be required prior to the Health B enefit Plan's use or disclosure of Members' personal health information. Members should consult the Notice for detailed information regarding their privacy rights. Membe r Id Card Listed below are some important things to do and to remember about the Membe r's ID Card: Check the information on the Member's ID Card for completeness and accuracy. Check that the Member received one ID Card for each enrolled family member. Check that the name of the Primary Care Physician (or office) the Member selected is shown on the Member's ID Card. Also, please check the ID Card for each family member to be sure the information on it is accurate. Call Customer Service if the Member finds an error or loses their ID Card. Carry the Member ID Card at all times. The Member must p resent their ID Card whenever they receive Medical Care. On the reverse side of the ID Card, the Member will find information about medical services, especially useful in Emergencies. There is even a tol l-free number for use by Hospitals if the Member has questions about their coverage. PROGRAM DESIGN FE ATURES This Program is different from traditional health insurance coverage. In addition to covering health care services, access is provided to Member's Medical Care through their Primary Care Physician. All medical treatment begins with the Member's Primary Care Physician. (Under certain circumstances, continuing care by a Non -Participating Provider will be treated in the same way as if the Provider were a Participating Provider. See Continuit y of Care appearing later in the Benefit Booklet). Because the Member's Primary Care Physician is the key to using this Program, it is important to remember the following: The Member should always call their Primary Care Physician first, before receiving Medical Car e, except for conditions requiring Emergency Services. Please schedule routine visits well in advance. KE 670 SG EXC HMO Gold Premier 86 When the Member needs Specialist Services their Primar y Care Physician will give the Member an electronic Referral for specific care or will obtain a P reapproval from the Health Benefit Plan when required. A Standing Referral may be available to the Member if they have a life -threatening, degenerative or disabling disease or condition. Female Members may visit any participating obstetrical/gynecological Specialist without a Referral. This is true whether the visit is for preventive care, routine obstetrical/gynecological care or problem -related obstetrical/gy necological conditions. The Member's Primary Care Physician must obtain a Preapproval for Special ist Services provided by Non -Participating Providers. The Member's Primary Care Physician is required to select a Designated Provider for certain Specialist Services. Their Primary Care Physician will submit an electronic Referral to his/her Designated Pr ovider for these outpatient Specialist Services: - Physical and Occupational Therapy; - Diagnostic Services for Members age five and older; - Laboratory and Pathology tests Designated Providers usually receive a set dollar amount per Member per month (capitation ) for their services based on the Primary Care Physicians that have selected them. Outpatient services are not covered when performed by any Provide r other than the Member's Primary Care Physician's Designated Provider. Before selecting their Primary Car e Physician, the Member may want to speak to the Primary Care Physician regarding his/her Designated Providers. The Member's Primary Care Physician provides coverage 24 hours a day, 7 days a week. All continuing care as a result of Emergency Services must be provided or Referred by the Member's Primary Care Physician or coordinated through Customer Service. Some services must be authorized by the Member's Primary Care Physician or Referred Specialist or Preapproved by the Health Benefit Plan. The Member 's Primary Care Physician or Referred Specialist works with the Health Benefit Plan's Care Management and Coordination team during the Preapprov al process. Services in this category include, but are not limited to: hospitalization; certain outpatient services; Skilled Nursing Facility services; and home health care. To access a complete list of services that require Preapproval, log onto www.ibx.com , or the Member can call Customer Service at the phone number shown on their ID Card to have the list mailed to them. A Member has the right to appeal any decisions through the Complaint And Grievance Appea l Process described later in this Benefit Booklet. Instructions for the appeal will be described in the denial notifications. All services must be received from Participating Providers unless Preapproved by the Health Benefit Plan, or except in cases requiring Emergency Services or Urgent Care while outside the Service Area. See Access To Primary, Specialist, And Hospital Care in this section for procedures for obtaining Preapproval for use of a Non -Participating Provider. Use the Provider Directory to KE 670 SG EXC HMO Gold Premier 87 find out more about the individual Providers, including Hospitals and Primary Care Physicians, and Referred Specialists, and their affiliated Hospitals. It include s a foreign language index to help the Member locate a Provider who is fluent in a particular language. The directory also lists whether the Provider is accepting new patients. To change the Member's Primary Care Physician, call Customer Service at the telephone number shown on their ID Card. Medical Technology A ssessment is performed by the Health Benefit Plan. Technology assessment is the review and evaluation of available clinical and scientific information from expert sources. These sources include an d are not limited to articles published by governmental agencies, national peer review journals, national experts, clinical trials, and manufacturer's literature. The Health Benefit Plan uses the technology assessment process to assure that new drugs, procedures or devices are safe and effective before approving them as a Covered Service. When new technology becomes available or at the request of a practitioner or Member, the Health Benefit Plan researches all scientific information available from these ex pert sources. Following this analysis, the Health Benefit Plan makes a decision about when a new drug, procedure or device has been proven to be safe and effective and uses this information to determine when an item becomes a Covered Service. Prescriptio n Drugs are covered under this Program. Under this Program, Prescription Drugs, including medications and biologicals, are Covered Services or Supplies when ordered during the Member's Inpatient Hospital stay. In addition, the Member also has Prescription D rug Coverage for Outpatient Prescription Drugs. Prescription Drug benefits cover certai n over-the-counter drugs including insulin. Additionally, Prescription Drug benefits are subject to quantity level limits as conveyed by the Food and Drug Administrati on (\"FDA\") or the Health Benefit Plan's Pharmacy and Therapeutics Committee. The Health Benefit Plan, for all Prescription Drug benefits, requires Preapproval of a small number of drugs approved by the FDA for use in specific medical conditions. Where Preapproval or quantity limits are imposed, The Member's Physician may request an exception for coverage by providing documentation of Medical Necessity. The Member may obtain information about how to request an exception by calling Customer Servi ce at the phone number on their ID Card. The Member, or their Physician acting on their behalf, may appeal any denial of benefits or application of higher cost sharing through the Complaint and Grievance Appeal Process described later in this Benefit Book let. Diseas e Management And Decision Support Disease Management and Decision Support programs help Members to be effective partners in their health care by providing information and support to Members with certain chronic conditions as well as those with everyday hea lth concerns. Disease Management is a systematic, population -based approach that involves identifying Members with certain chronic diseases, intervening with specific information or support to follow PCP's and Participating Professional Provider's treatme nt plan, and measuring clinical and other outcomes. Decision Support involves identifying Members who may be facing certain treatment option decisions and offering them information to assist in informed, collaborative decisions with their PCP's and KE 670 SG EXC HMO Gold Premier 88 Partici pating Professional Provider's. Decision Support also includes the availability of general health information, personal health coaching, PCP's and Participating Professional Provider's information, or other programs to assist in health care dec isions. Disease Management interventions are designed to help Members manage their chronic condition in partnership with their PCP's and Participating Professional Provider's. Disease Management programs, when successful, can help such Members avoid long term complic ations, as well as relapses that would otherwise result in Hospital or Emergency room care. Disease Management programs also include outreach to Members to obtain needed preventive services, or other services recommended for chronic conditions. Information and support may occur in the form of telephonic health coaching, print, audio library or videotape, or Internet formats. The Health Benefit Plan will utilize medical information such as claims data to operate the Disease Management or Decision Support pr ogram, to identify Members with chronic disease for example, to predict which Members would most likely benefit from these services, and to communicate results to Member's treating PCP's and Participating Professional Provider's. The Health Benefit Plan wi ll decide what chronic conditions are included in the Disease Management or Decision Support program. Participation by a Member in Disease Management or Decision Support programs is voluntary. A Member may continue in the Disease Management or Decision Sup port program until any of the following occurs: The Member notifies the Health Benefit Plan that they decline participation; or The Health Benefit Plan determines that the program, or aspects of the program, will not continue; The Member's Employer decides not to offer the programs. Discretionar y Authority The Health Benefit Plan retains discretionary authority to interpret th is Program and the facts presented to make benefit determinations. Benefits under this Program will be provided only if the Health B enefit Plan determines in its discretion that the Member is entitled to them. Out-Of-Area Services Keystone Health Plan East, Inc. (\"Keystone\") has a variety of relationships with other Blue Cross and/or Blue Shield Plans and their Licensed Controlled Aff iliates (\"Licensees\" ) referre d to Whenever the Member obtains healthcare services outside of Keystone's Service Area, the claims for these services may be processed through one of these Inter -Plan Programs. Typically, when accessing care outside Keystone's Serv ice Area, the Member will obtain care from healthcare providers that have a contractual agreement (That is, are \"Participating Providers\") with the local Blue Cross and/or Blue Shield Licensee in that other geograp hic area (\"Host Blue\"). In some instances, the Member may obtain care from non -participating healthcare providers. Keystone's payment practices in both instances are described below. Keystone covers only limited healthcare services received outside of our Service Area. As used in this section, \"O ut-of-Area Covered Healthcare Services\" include Emergency Care, Urgent Care and Follow -up Care obtained outside the geographic area we serve. Any other services will not be covered when processed through any Inter -Plan Programs arrangements. These \"other s ervices\" must be provided or authorized by the Member's Primary Care Physician KE 670 SG EXC HMO Gold Premier 89 (\"PCP\"). BlueCard\u00ae Program Under the BlueCard\u00ae Program, when a Member obtains Out -of-Area Covered Healthcare Services within the geog raphic area served by a Host Blue, Keystone will remain responsible for fulfilling our contractual obligations. However, the Host Blue is responsible for contracting with and generally handling all interactions with its participating healthcare providers. The BlueCard Program enables the Member to obtain Out -of-Area Covered Healthcare Services, as defined above, from a healthcare provider participating with a Host Blue, where available. The participating healthcare provider will automatically file a claim fo r the Out -of- Area Covered Healthcare Services provided to the Member, so there are no claim forms for the Member to fill out. The Member will be responsible for the Copayment amount, as stated in the Schedule of Covered Services . Non-Participating Healthc are Providers Outside Keystone's Service Area See the Preapproval For Non -Participating Providers in this section of the Benefit Booklet for information regarding services provided by Non -Participating Providers. ACCESS TO PRIMA RY, SPECI ALIST, AND HOSPIT AL CARE Direc t Access To Certain Care A Member does not need a Referral from his/her Primary Care Physician for the following Covered Services: Emergency Services; Care from a participating obstetr ical/gynecological Specialist ; Mammograms; Mental Health Care, Serious Mental Illness Health Care and Alcohol Or Drug Abuse And Dependency; Inpatient Hospital Services that require Preapproval. This does not include a maternity Inpatient Admission; Dialysis services performed in a Participating Facility Provider or by a Participating Professional Provider; Nutrition Counseling for Weight Management ; and Diabetic Education Program. How To Obtain A Specialist Referral The Member should always consult their Primary Care Physician first when they need Medical Care. If the Member's Primary Care Physician refers them to a Referred Specialist or facility just follow these steps: The Member's Primary Care Physician will submit an electronic Referral indicating the services authorized. The Member's Referral is valid for 90 days from issue date as long as they are a Member. This form is sent electronically to the Referred Specialist or facility befor e the services are performed. Only services authorized on the Referr al form wil l be covered. Any additional Medically Necessary treatment recommended by the Referred Specialist beyond the 90 days from the date of issue of the initial Referral will require another electronic Referral from the Member's Primary Care Physician. The M ember must be enrolled at the time they receive services from a Referred Specialist or Non-Participating Provider in order for services to be covered. KE 670 SG EXC HMO Gold Premier 90 See the Preapproval for Non -Participating Providers section of the Benefit Booklet for information regarding services provided by Non-Participating Providers. How To Obtain A Standing Referral If the Member has a lif e-threatening, degenerative or disabling disease or condition, they may receive a Standing Referral to a Participating Professional Prov ider to treat that disease or condition. The Referred Specialist will have clinical expertise in treating the disease or condition. A Standing Referral is granted upon review of a treatment plan by the Health Benefit Plan and in consultation with the Member 's Primary Care Physician. Follow these steps to initiate a Standing Referral request. Call Customer Service at the telephone number shown on the Member's ID Card. (Or, the Member may ask their Primary Care Physician to call Provider Services or Care Management and Coordination to obtain a \"Standing Referral Request\" form.) A \"Standing R eferral Request\" form will be mailed or faxed to the requestor. The Member must complete a part of the form and their Primary Care Physician will complete the clinical par t. The Member's Primary Care Physician will then send the form to Care Management and Coordination. Care Management and Coordination will either approve or deny the request for the Standing Referral. The Member, their Primary Care Physician and the Referred Specialist will receive notice of the approval or denial in writing. The notice will include the time period for the Standing Referral. If the Standing Referral is Approved If the request for the Standing Referral to a Referred Specialist is approved, th e Referred Specialist, the Member, and the Primary Care Physician will be inform ed in writing by Care Management and Coordination. The Referred Specialist must agree to abide by all the terms and conditions that the Health Benefit Plan has established with regard to Standing Referrals. This includes, but is not limited to, the need for the Referred Specialist to keep the Member's Primary Care Physician informed of their condition. When the Standing Referral expires, the Member or their Primary Care Physici an will need to contact Care Management and Coordination and follow the steps outlined above to see if another Standing Referral will be approved. If the Standing Referral is Denied If the request for a Standing Referral is denied, the Member and their Pr imary Care Physician will be informed in writing. The Member will be given inform ation on how to file a formal Complaint, if they so desire. Designatin g A Referre d Specialis t As A Member' s Primar y Care Physician If the Member has a lif e-threatening, degen erative or disabling disease or condition, they may have a Referred Specialist named to provide and coordinate both their primary and specialty care. The Referred Specialist will be a Physician with clinical expertise in treating their disease or conditio n. It is required that the Referred Specialist agrees to meet the Program's requi rements to function as a Primary Care Physician. KE 670 SG EXC HMO Gold Premier 91 Follow these steps to initiate a request for a Member's Referred Specialist to be their Primary Care Physician. Call Customer Service at the telephone number shown on the Member's ID Card. (Or, the Member may ask their Primary Care Physician to call Provider Services or Care Management and Coordination to initiate the request.). A \"Request for Specialist to Coordinate All Care\" f orm will be mailed or faxed to the requestor. The Member must complete a part of the form and their Primary Care Physician will complete the clinical part. The Member's Primary Care Physician will then send the form to Care Management and Coordination. The Medical Director will speak directly with the Member's Primary Care Physician and the selected Referred Specialist to apprise all parties of the primary services that the Referred Specialist must be able to provide in order to be designated as a Member's Primary Care Physician. If Care Management and Coordination approves the request, it will be sent to the Provider Service area. That area will confirm that the Referred Specialist meets the same credentialing standards that apply to Primary Care Physicians . (At the same time, the Member will be given a Standing Referral to see the Referred Specialist.). If the Referred Specialist as Primary Care Physician Request is Approved If the request for the Referred Specialist to be the Member's Primary Care Physic ian is approved, the Referred Specialist, the Member's Primary Care Physi cian and the Member will be informed in writing by Care Management and Coordination. If the Referred Specialist as Primary Care Physician Request is Denied If the request to have a R eferred Specialist designated to provide and coordinate the Member's primary and specialty care is denied, the Member and their Primary Care Physician will be informed in writing. The Member will be given information on how to file a formal Complaint, if they so desire. Changing A Member's Primary Care Physician The Member may change their Primary Care Physician up to two times within each Benefit Period. To do so, simply call Customer Service at the telephone number shown on the Member's ID Card. The chang e will be effective on the first of the month following the Member's phone call. The Member must remember to have their medical records transferred to their new Primary Care Physician. If the participating status of the Member's Primary Care Physician cha nges, they will be notified in order to select another Primary Care Phys ician. Changing A Member's Referred Specialist The Member may change the Referred Specialist to whom they have been referred by their Primary Care Physician or for whom the Member has a Standing Referral. To do so, the Member asks their Primary Care Physi cian to recommend another Referred Specialist before services are performed. Or, the Member may call Customer Service at the telephone number shown on their ID Card. Remember, only ser vices authorized on the Referral form will be covered. If the participating status of a Referred Specialist the Member regularly visits changes, they will be notified to select another Referred Specialist. KE 670 SG EXC HMO Gold Premier 92 Continuity Of Care The Member has the option, if their Physician agrees to be bound by certain terms and conditions as r equired by the Health Benefit Plan, of continuing an ongoing course of treatment with that Physician. This continuation of care shall be offered through the current period of active tr eatment for an acute condition or through the acute phase of a chronic c ondition or for up to 90 calendar days from the notice that the status of the Member's Physician has changed or the Member's Effective Date of Coverage when: The Member's Physician is no longer a Participating Provider because the Health Benefit Plan terminates its contract with that Physician, for reasons other than cause; or The Member first enrolls in this Program and is in an ongoing course of treatment with a Non-Participating Provider. If the Member is in their second or third trimester of pregnancy at the time of their enrollment or termination of a Participating Provider's contract, the continuity of care with that Physician will extend through pos t-partum care related to the de livery. The Member should follow these steps to initiate their continuity of care: Call Customer Service at the number on the Member's ID Card and ask for a \"Request for Continuation of Treatment\" form. The \"Request for Continuation of Treatment\" form wi ll be mailed or faxed to the Member. The Member must complete the form and send it to Care Management and Coordination at the address that appears on the form. If the Member's Physician agrees to continue to provide their ongoing care, the Physician must also agree to be bound by the same terms and conditions as apply to Participati ng Providers. The Member will be notified when the participating status of their Primary Care Physician changes so that they can select another Primary Care Physician. Preapprova l For Non-Participating Providers The Health Benefit Plan may approve payment for Covered Services provided by a Non - Participating Provider if the Member has: First sought and received care from a Participating Provider in the same American Board of Medical Specialties (ABMS) recognized specialty as the Non -Participating Provider that the Member has requested. (The Member's Primary Care Physician is required to obtain Preapproval from the Health Benefit Plan for services provided by a Non -Participating Provider.); Been advised by the Participating Provider that there are no Participating Providers that can provide the requested Covered Services; and Obtained authorization from the Health Benefit Plan prior to receiving care. The Health Benefit Plan reserv es the right to make the final determination whether there is a Particip ating Provider that can provide the Covered Services. If the Health Benefit Plan approves the use of a Non -Participating Provider, the Member will not be responsible for the difference between the Provider's billed charges and the Health Benefit Plan's payment to the Provider but the Member will be responsible for applicable cos t-sharing amounts. If the Member receives any bills from the Provider, they need to contact Customer Service at the telephone number on their ID card. When the Member notifies the H ealth Benefit Plan about these bills, the Health Benefit Plan will resolve the balance billing. KE 670 SG EXC HMO Gold Premier 93 Hospita l Admissions If the Member needs hospitalization or outpatient Surgery, the Membe r's Primar y Care Physician or Referred Specialist will arrange admiss ion to the Hospital or outpatient surgical facility on their behalf. The Member's Primary Care Physician or Referred Specialist will coordinate the Preapproval for their outpatient Surger y or Inpatient admission with the Health Benefit Plan, and the Heal th Benefit Plan will assign a Preapproval number. Preapproval is not required for a maternity Inpatient Admission. The Member does not need to receive an electronic Referral from their Pri mary Care Physician for Inpatient Hospital Services that require P reapproval. Upon receipt of information from the Member's Primary Care Physician or Referred Specialist, Care Management and Coordination will evaluate the request for hospitalization or out patient Surgery based on clinical criteria guidelines. Should the request be denied after review by a Health Benefit Plan Medical Director, the Member, their Primary Care Physician or their Referred Specialist has a right to appeal this decision through th e Grievanc e appeal process. During an Inpatient hospitalization, Care Management and Coordination is monitoring the Member's Hospital stay to assure that a plan for their discharge is in place. This is to make sure that the Member has a smooth transition from the Hospital to home, or to another setting such as a Skille d Nursing or Rehabilitation Facility. A Health Benefit Plan Case Manager will work closely with the Member's Primary Care Physician or Referred Specialist to help with their discharge and if necessary, arrange for other medical services. Should the Member 's Primary Care Physician or Referred Specialist agree with the Health Benefit Plan that Inpatient hospitalization services are no longer required, the Member will be notified in writing of t his decision. Should the Member decide to remain hospitalized after this notification, the Hospital has the right to bill the Member after the date of the notification. The Member may appeal this decision through the Grievance appeal process. Recommended Plan Of Treatment The Member agrees, when enrolling in this Progr am, to receive care according to the recommendations of their Primary Care Physician or Referred Specialist. The Member has the right to give their informed consent before the start of any pr ocedure or treatment. The Member also has the right to refuse any drugs, treatment or other procedure offered to them by providers in the Health Benefit Plan's network, and to be informed by their Physician of the medical consequences of their refusal of a ny drugs, treatment, or procedure. The Health Benefit Plan and the Member's Primary Care Physician will make every effort to arrange a professionally acceptable alternative treatment. However, if the Member still refuses the recommended Plan of Treatment, the Health Benefit Plan will not be responsible for the costs of further treatment for that condition and the Member will be so notified. The Member may use the Grievance appeal process to have their case reviewed, if they so desire. Special Circumstance s In the event that Special Circumstances result in a severe impact to the availability of Providers and services, to the procedures required for obtaining benefits for Covered Services under this Program described in this Benefit Booklet (For example, ob taining Referrals, use of Participating Providers), or to the admi nistration of this Program by the Health Benefit Plan, the Health Benefit Plan may, on a selective basis, waive certain procedural requirements of this Program. Such waiver shall be specific as to the requirements that are waived and shall last for such KE 670 SG EXC HMO Gold Premier 94 period of time as is required by the Special Circumstances as defined below. The Health Benefit Plan shall make a good faith effort to arrange for an alternative method of providing coverage. In such event, the Health Benefit Plan shall provide access to Covered Services in so far as practical, and according to its best judgment. Neither the Health Benefit Plan nor Providers in the Health Benefit Plan's network shall incur liability or obligati on for delay, or failure to provide or arrange for Covered Servi ces if such failure or delay is caused by Special Circumstances. Special Circumstances, as recognized in the community and by the Health Benefit Plan and appropriate regulatory authority, are extraordinary circumstances not within the control of the Health Benefit Plan, including but not limited to: A major disaster; Riot; An epidemic; Civil insurrection; or A pandemic; The complete or partial destruction of facilities. Member Liability Except when certain cost sharing is specified in this Benefit Booklet or on the Schedule of Covered Services , the Member is not liable for any charges for Covered Services when these services have been provided or Referred by their Primary Care Physician and they are eligible for such benefits on the date of service. Right To Recover Payments Made In Error If the Health Benefit Plan should provide coverage for any contractually excluded services through inadvertence or error, the Health Benefit Plan mai ntains the right to seek recovery of such payment from the Provider or Member to whom such payment was made. INFORM ATION ABOUT PROVIDE R REIMBURSEMENT The Health Benefit Plan reimbursement programs for he alth care providers are intended to encourage the provision of quality, cos t-effective care for our Members. Set forth below is a general description of the Health Benefit Plan reimbursement programs, by type of participating health care provider. These pr ograms vary by state. Please note that these programs may change from time to time, and the arrangements with particular providers may be modified as new contracts are negotiated. If after reading this material the Member has any questions about how their health care provider is compensated, please speak with them directly or contact Customer Service. Professional Providers Primary Care Physicians : Mos t Primary Care Physicians (PCPs) are paid in advance for their services, receiving a set dollar amount pe r Member, per month for each Member selecting that PCP. This is called a capitation payment and it covers most of the care delivered by the PCP. Covered Services not included under capitation are paid fee -for-service according to the Health Benefit Plan fe e schedule. Many Pennsylvania based PCPs are also eligible to receive additional payments for meeting certain medical quality, patient service and other performance standards. In Pennsylvania, the PCP Quality Incentive Payment System (QIPS) includes incent ives for practices that have extended hours and submit encounter and referral data electronically, as well as an incentive that is based on the extent to which a PCP prescribes generic drugs (when available) relative to similar PCPs. In addition, the Prac tice Quality Assessment Score focuses on preventive care and other established clinical interventions. KE 670 SG EXC HMO Gold Premier 95 Referred Specialists: Most Referred Specialists are paid on a fee -for-service basis, meaning that payment is made according to the Health Benefit Plan's fee schedule for the specific medical services that the Referred Specialist performs. Obstetricians are paid global fees that cover most of their prof essional services for prenatal care and for delivery. Designated Providers: For a few specialt y services , PCPs are required to select a Designated Provider to which they refer all of the Health Benefit Plan patients for those services. The Specialist serv ices for which PCPs must select a Designated Provider vary by state and could include, but are not limited to, radiology and Physical Therapy. Designated Providers usually are paid a set dollar amount per Member per month (capitation) for their services based on the PCPs that have selected them. Before selecting a PCP, Members may want to speak to the PCP reg arding the Designated Provider that PCP has chosen. Hospital -Based Provider: When the Member receives Covered Services from a Hospital -Based Provider while they are an Inpatient at a Participating Hospital or other Participating Facility Provider and are b eing treated by a Participating Professional Provider, the Member will receive benefits for the Covered Services provided by the Non -Participating Hos pital-Based Provider. A Hospital -Based Provider can bill the Member directly for their services, for eithe r the Provider's charges or amounts in excess of the Health Benefit Plan's payment to the Hospital -Based Providers (That is, \"balance billing\"). If the Member receives any bills from the Provider, the Member needs to contact Customer Services at the teleph one number on the ID card. When the Member notifies the Health Benefit Plan about these bills, the Health Benefit Plan will resolve the balance billing. Institutional Providers Hospitals: For most inpatient medical and surgical Covered Services, Hospitals are paid per diem rates, which are specific amounts paid for each day a Member is in the Hospital. These rates usually vary according to the intensity of services provided. Some Hospitals are also paid case rates, which are set dollar amounts paid for a complete Hospital stay related to a specific procedure or diagnosis, (For example, transplants). For most outpatient and Emergency Covered Services and procedures, most Hospitals are paid specific rates based on the type of service performed. Hospitals may also be paid a global rate for certain outpatient Covered Services (For example, lab and radiology) that includes both the facility and Physician pay ment. For a few Covered Services, Hospitals are paid based on a percentage of billed charges. Most Hospita ls are paid through a combination of the above payment mechanisms for various Covered Services. Some Hospitals participate in a quality incentive program. The program provides increased reimbursement to these Hospitals when they meet specific quality and other criteria, including \"Patient Safety Measures.\" Such patient safety measures are consistent with recommendations by The Leap Frog Group, Joint Commission on Accreditation of Healthcare Organizations (JCAHO), and the Agency for Health Care Research and Quality (AHRQ) and are designed to help reduce medical and medication errors. Other criteria are directed at improved patient outcomes and electronic submissions. This incentive program is expected to evolve over time. KE 670 SG EXC HMO Gold Premier 96 Skilled Nursing Homes, Rehabilitati on Hospitals, and other care facilitie s: Most Skilled Nursing Facilities and other special care facilities are paid per diem rates, which are specific amounts paid for each day a Member is in the facility. These amounts may vary according to the intensity of services provided. Ambulatory Surgical Centers (ASCs) Most ASCs are paid specific rates based on the type of service performed. For a few Covered Services, some ASCs are paid based on a percentage of billed charges Physician Group Practices and Physician Associations Certain Physician group practices and independent Physician associations (IPAs) employ or contract with individual Physicians to prov ide medical Covered Services. These groups are paid as outlined above. These groups may pay their affiliat ed Physicians a salary and/or provide incentives based on production, quality, service, or other performance standards. Ancillary Service Providers Some ancillary service providers, such as Durable Medical Equipment and Home Health Care Providers, are pai d fee-for-service payments according to the Health Benefit Plan fee schedule for the specific medical services performed. Other ancillary service prov iders, such as those providing laboratory, dental or vision Covered Services, are paid a set dollar amount per Member per month (capitation). Capitated ancillary service vendors are responsible for paying their contracted providers and do so on a fee -for-service basis. Mental Health/Alcohol Or Drug Abuse And Dependency A Mental Health/Alcohol Or Drug Abuse A nd Dependenc y (\"behavioral health\") management company administers most of the behavioral health benefits, provides a network of Participating Behavior Specialists and processes the related claims. The behavioral health management company is paid a set dol lar amount per Member per month (capitation) for each Member and is responsible for paying its contracted providers on a fee -for-service basis. The contract with the behavioral health management company includes performanc e-based payments related to quality, provider access, service, and other such parameters. A subsidiary of Independence Blue Cross has a less than one percent ownership interest in this behavioral health management company. Pharmacy A pharmacy benefits management company (PBM), which is af filiated with the Health Benefit Plan, administers the Prescription Drug benefits, and is responsible for providing a network of Participating Pharmac ies and processing pharmacy claims. The PBM also negotiates price discounts with pharmaceutical manufactur ers and provides drug utilization and quality reviews. Price discounts may include rebates from a drug manufacturer based on the volume purchased. The Health Benefit Plan anticipates that it will pass on a high percentage of the expected rebates it receiv es from its PBM through reductions in the overall cost of Prescription Drug benefits. Under most benefit plans, Covered Drugs Or Supplies are subject to the Member's cost-sharing. KE 670 SG EXC HMO Gold Premier 97 UTILIZA TION REVIEW PROCESS AND CRITERIA Utilization Review Process Two conditions of this Program are that in order for a health care service to be covered or payable, the service must be: Eligible for coverage under this Pr ogram; and, Medically Necessary. To assist the Health B enefit Plan in making coverage determinations for certain requested health care services, the Health Benefit Plan uses established Health Benefit Plan medical policies and medical guidelines based on clinically credible evidence to determine the Medical Necessity of the requested services. The appropriateness of the requested setting in which the services are to be performed is part of this assessment. The process of determining the Medical Necessity of requested health care services for coverage determinat ions based on the benefits available under a Member's benefit plan is called utilization review. It is not practical to verify Medical Necessity on all procedures on all occasions, therefore certai n procedures may be determined by the Health Benefit Plan to be Medically Necessary and automatically approved based on the accepted Medical Necessity of the procedure itself, the diagnosis reported or an agreement with the performing Provider. An example of such automatically approved services is an established list of services received in an emergency room which have been approved by the Health Benefit Plan based on the procedure meeting Emergency criteria and the severity of diagnosis reported (For example, rule out myocardial infarction, or major trauma). Othe r requested services, such as certain elective Inpatient or Outpatient procedures may be reviewed on a procedure specific or setting basis. Utilization review generally includes several components which are based on when the review is performed. When the review is required before a service is performed (pr e-service review) it is called Precertification (applicable when the Member's benefit plan provides benefits for services performed without the re quired Referral or by No n-Participating Providers (That is, point-of- service coverage) or Preapproval. Reviews occurring during a Hospital stay are called concurrent reviews. Those reviews occurring after services have been performed (pos t-service reviews ) are called retrospective reviews. The Health Benefit Plan follows applicable state and federally required standards for the timeframes in which such reviews are to be performed. Generally, where a requested service is not automatically approved and must undergo Medical Necessity review, nurses perform the initi al case review and evaluation for plan coverage approval using the Health Benefit Plan's medical policies, established guidelines and evidenc e- based clinical criteria and protocols; however only a Medical Director may deny coverage for a procedure based on Medical Necessity. The evidenc e-based clinical protocols evaluate the Medical Necessity of specific procedures and the majority is computer -based. Information provided in support of the request i s entered into the computer -based system and evaluated against the clinical protocols. Nurses apply applicable benefit plan policies and procedures, taking into consideration the individual Member's condition and applying sound professional judgment. When the clinical criteria are not met, the given service request is referred to a Medical Director for further review for approval or denial. Independent medical consultants may also be engaged to provide clinical review of specific cases or for specific condi tions. Should a procedure be denied for coverage based on l ack of Medical Necessity a letter is sent to the requesting Provider and Member in accordance with applicable law. KE 670 SG EXC HMO Gold Premier 98 The Health Benefit Plan's utilization review program encourages peer dialogue regarding coverage decisions based on Medical Necessity by providing Physicians with direct access to plan Medical Directors to discuss coverage of a case. The nurses, Medical Directors, other Professional Providers, and independent medical consultants who perform utilization review services are not compensated or given incentives based on their coverage review decisions. Medical Directors and nurses are salaried, and contracted external Physician and other professional consultants are compensated on a per cas e reviewed basis, regardless of the coverage determination. The Health Benefit Plan does not specifically reward or provide financial incentives to individuals performing utilization review services for issuing denials of coverage. There are no financial i ncentives for such individuals which would encourage utilization review decisions that result in underutilization. Precertification or Preapprova l When required and applicable, Precertification or Preapproval evaluates the Medical Necessity, including the appropriateness of the setting, of proposed services for c overage under the Member's benefit plan. Examples of these services include certain planned or elective Inpatient Admissions and selected outpatient procedures according to the Member's benefit plan. Where required by the Member's benefit plan, Preapproval is initiated by the Provider and Precertification is initiated by the Member. Where Precertification or Preapproval is required, coverage of the proposed procedure is contingent upon the review being completed and receipt of the approval certification. C overage penalties may be applied when Precertification is required for a procedure but is not obtained. If the Primary Care Physician or Referred Specialist fails to obtain Preapproval when required, and provides Covered Services or Referrals without obtai ning such Preapproval, the Member will not be responsible for payment. While the majority of services requiring Precertification or Preapproval are reviewed for medical appropriateness of the requested procedure setting (For example, inpatient, Short Proc edure Unit, or outpatient setting), other elements of the Medical Necessity of the procedure may not always be evaluated and may be automatically approved based on the procedure or diagnosis for which the procedure is requested or an agreement with the performing Provider. Precertification or Preapproval is not required for Emergency services and is not performed where an agreement with the Participating Provider does not require such review. The following are general examples of current Precertification or Preapproval requirements under benefit plans; however these requirements vary by benefit plan and state and are subject to change Hysterectomy; Nasal Surgery procedures; Bariatric Surgery; and Potentially cosmetic or Experimental/Investigative Services. Concurrent Review Concurrent review may be performed while services are being performed. This may occur during an Inpatient Admission and typically evaluates the expected and current length of stay to determine if continued hospitalization is Medically Necessary. When performed, the review assesses the level of care provided to the Member and coordinates discharge planning. Concurrent review continues until the patient is discharged. Not all inpatient stays are reviewed concurrently. Concurrent review is ge nerally not performed where an inpatient facility is paid KE 670 SG EXC HMO Gold Premier 99 based on a per case or diagnosis -related basis, or where an agreement with the facility does not require such review. Retrospective Review Retrospective review occurs after services have been prov ided. This may be for a variety of reasons, including the Health Benefit Plan not being notified of a Member's Inpatient Admission until after discharge or where medical charts are unavailable at the time of a required concurrent review. Certain services ar e only reviewed on a retrospective basis. Prenotification In addition to the standard utilization reviews outlined above, the Health Benefit Plan also may determine coverage of certain procedures and other benefits available to Members through Prenotific ation, as required by the Members' benefit plan, and discharge planning. Prenotification is advance notification to the Health Benefit Plan of an Inpatient Admission or Outpatient service where no Medical Necessity review (Precertification or Preapproval) is required, such as maternity admissions/deliveries. Prenotification is primarily used to identify Members for concurrent review needs, to ascertain discharge planning needs proactively, and to identify who may benefit from Case Management programs. Disch arge Planning Discharge planning is performed during an Inpatient Admission and is used to identify and coordinate a Member's needs and benefit plan coverage following the Inpatient Admission, such as covered home care, ambulance transport, acute rehabili tation, or Skilled Nursing Facility placement. Discharge planning involves the Health Benefit Plan's authorization of post- Hospital Covered Services and identifying and referring Members to Disease Management or Case Management benefits. Selectiv e Medical Review In addition to the foregoing requirements, the Health Benefit Plan reserves the right, under its utilization and quality management programs, to perform a medical review prior to, during or following the performance of certain Covered Services (\"sel ective medical review\") that are otherwise not subject to review as described above. In addition, the Health Benefit Plan reserves the right to waive medical review for certain Covered Services for certain Providers, if the Health Benefit Plan determines t hat those Providers have an established record of meeting the utilization and/or quality management standards for those Covered Services. Regardless of the outcome of the Health Benefit Plan's selective medical review, there are no coverage penalties appl ied to the Member. CLINICAL CRITERIA, GUIDELINE S AND RESOURCES The following guidelines, clinical criteria and other resources are used to help make Medical Necessity coverage decisions: Clinica l Decisio n Suppor t Criteria Clinical decision support criter ia are an externally validated and computer -based system used to assist the Health Benefit Plan in determining Medical Necessity. These evidenc e-based, clinical Decision Support criteria are nationally recognized and validated. Using a model based on evalua ting intensity of service and severity of illness, these criteria assist the Health Benefit Plan's clinical staff in evaluating the Medical Necessity and appropriateness of coverage based on a Member's specific clinical needs. Clinical decision support cr iteria help promote consistency in the Health Benefit Plan's plan determinations for similar medical issues and KE 670 SG EXC HMO Gold Premier 100 requests, and reduce practice variation among the Health Benefit Plan's clinical staff to minimize subjective decision -making. Clinical decision support criteria may be applied for Covered Services including, but not limited to the following: Some elective surgeries \u2014settings for Inpatient rehabilitation care; Inpatient and Outpatient procedures Home Health Care; example, hysterectomy and s inus surgery); Durable Medical Equipment (DME); and Inpatient Hospital Services; Skilled Nursing Facility Services. Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS) Guidelines These are a set of guidelines adopted and published by CMS for coverage of ser vices by Medicare and Medicaid for persons who are eligible and have health coverage through Medicare or Medicaid. The Health Benefit Plan's Medical Policies These are the Health Benefit Plan's internally developed set of policies which document the cove rage and conditions for certain medical/surgical procedures and ancillary services. The Health Benefit Plan's medical polices may be applied for Covered Services including, but not limited to the following: Ambulance; Occupational Therapy; Infusion; Durable Medical Equipment (DME); and Speech Therapy; Review of potential cosm etic procedures. The Health Benefit Plan's Internally Developed Guidelines These are a set of guidelines developed specifically by the Health Benefit Plan, as needed, with input by clinical experts based on accepted practice guidelines within the specifi c fields and reflecting the Health Benefit Plan's medical policies for benefit plan coverage. DELEG ATION OF UTILIZA TION REVIEW ACTIVITIES AND CRITERIA The Health Benefit Plan delega tes its utilization review process to its affiliate, Independence Healthcare Management, a state - licensed utilization review entity. In certain instances, the Health Benefit Plan has delegated certain utilization review activities, which may include Prea pproval, Precertification, concurrent review, and Case Management, to integrated delivery systems and/or entities with an expertise in medical management of a certain membership population (such as, neonates/premature infants) or a type of benefit or service (such as behavioral health or radiology ). In such instances, a formal delegation and oversight process is established in accordance with applicable law and nationally -recognized accreditation standards. In such cases, the delegate's utilization review c riteria are generally used, with the Health Benefit Plan's approval. Utilization Review and Criteria for Behavioral Health Services Utilization Review activities for behavioral health services (mental health and Alcohol or Drug Abuse and Dependency servic es) have been delegated by the Health Benefit Plan to its contracted behavi oral health management company which administers the behavioral health benefits for the majority of the Health Benefit Plan's Member's. KE 670 SG EXC HMO Gold Premier 101 COORDINA TION OF BENEFITS If a Member or any of their Dependents have other group health insurance coverage which provides benefits for Hospital, medical, or other health expenses, the Member's benefit payments may be subject to Coordination of Benefits (COB). COB re fers to the administration of health benefit coverage when a person is covered by more than one group plan. C OB provisions: Determine which health plan will be the primary payor and which will be the secondary payor; Regulate benefit payments so that tot al payments by all insurers do not exceed total charges for Covered Services; Apply to all Member benefits, however, the Health Benefit Plan will provide access to Covered Services first and apply the applicable COB rules later; Allow the Health Benefit P lan to recover any expenses paid in excess of its obligation as a non-primary payor; and Apply to serv ices for the treatment of injury resulting from the maintenance or use of a motor vehicle. Coordination of Benefit provisions do not apply to Prescription Drug or Vision Care coverage. Coordination of Benefits A dministration Determination will be made as to whether the Member is also entitled to receive benefits under any other group health care insurance plan or under any governmental program for which a ny periodic payment is made by or for the Member, with the exception of student accident plans, group hospital indemnity plans paying one hundred dollars ($100) per day or less and, if provided under the Member's Progra m, coverage for Prescription Drug or vision expenses. If so, the Health Benefit Plan shall determine whether the other insurer or government plan has primary responsibility for payment. In these cases, the payment under this Program may be reduced or eliminated. The Health Benefit Plan will p rovide access to Covered Services first and determine liability later. If it is determined that this Program is the secondary plan, the Health Benefit Plan has the right to recover the expense already paid in excess of this Program's liability as the sec ondary plan. In such cases, only care provided or Referred by the Member's Primary Care Physician will be covered by this Program as secondary. The Member is required to furnish information and to take such other action as is necessary to assure the rights of the Health Benefit Plan. In determining whether this Program or another group health plan has primary liability the following will apply. If another plan under which an individual has coverage with does not have a COB provision, that plan will be prim ary and this Program will be secondary. In order for services to be covered by this Program as secondary, the Member's care must be provided or Referred by their Primary Care Physician. If the other plan does include a Coordination of Benefits or non -duplic ation provision: - The plan which covers an individual as a Subscriber (meaning not a dependent) w ill be primary. The plan which covers the individual as a dependent will be secondary; - If there is a court decree which establishes financial responsibility for the health care expenses of the dependent child, the plan which covers the child as a dependent of the parent with such financial responsibility will be the primary plan; - Where both plans cover a child as a dependent, the plan of the parent whose date of birth (excluding year) occurs earlier in the calendar year will be primary (the Birthday KE 670 SG EXC HMO Gold Premier 102 Rule). If both parents have the same birthday, the plan covering the parent longer will be primary. If the other plan does not include this provision, the provisions o f that plan will determine the order of benefits. - If parents are separated or divorced, and no court decree applies, the benefits for the child will be determined as follows: The plan of the parent with custody of the child will be primary; The plan of the spouse of the parent with custody of the child will be secondary; The plan of the parent not having custody of the child will be third; In cases of joint cust ody, benefits will be determined by the Birthday Rule. - Where there is a court decree which establ ishes financial responsibility for the health care expenses of the child, the plan which covers the child as a dependent of the parent with such financial responsibility will be the primary plan. - In cases of joint custody, benefits will be determined by th e Birthday Rule as described in the second bulleted item above regarding the \"Coordination of Benefits or non - duplication provision\". The benefits of a plan covering the patient as a lai d-off or retired employee or as the Dependent of a laid off or retired employee shall be determined after the benefits of any other plan covering such person as an employee or dependent of such person. If the other plan does not have the rule regarding lai d-off or retired employees, and if, as a result, the plans do not agr ee on the order of benefits, the rule will be ignored. Where the determination cannot be made in accordance with the preceding paragraphs, the plan which has covered the patient for the longer period of time will be the primary plan. Expenses for the treatm ent of injury arising out of the maintenance or use of a motor vehicle shall be eligible for coverage only to the extent that such benefits are in excess of, and not in duplication of, benefits paid or payable: - Under a plan or policy of motor vehicle insur ance, provided that non -duplication as contained herein is not prohibited by law; or - Through a program or other arrangement of qualified or certified sel f-insurance.

COMPLAINT AND GRIEVANCE A PPEA L PROCESS GENER AL INFORMA TION ABOUT THE APPEAL PROCE SSES The Health Benefit Plan maintains a Complaint appeal process and a Grievance appeal process for its Members. Each of these appeal processes provides formal review for a Member's dissatisfaction with a denial of coverage or other i ssues related to his/h er health plan underwritten by the Health Benefit Plan. The Complaint appeal process and the Grievance appeal process focus on different issues and have other differences. Please refer to the separate sections below entitled Member Complaint Appeal Proces s and Member Grievance A ppeal Process for specific information on each process . However, the Complaint appeal process and Grievance appeal process also have some common features. To understand how to pursue a Member appeal, the Member should also review the background information outlined here that applies to both the Complaint appeal process and the Grievance appeal process. Authorizing Someone To Represent the Member. At any time, the Member may choose a third party to be their representative in their M ember appeal such as a Provider, lawyer, relative, friend, another individual, or a person who is part of an organization. The law states that the Member's written authorization or consent is required in order for this third party \u2014 called an \"Appeal Repres entative\" or \"Authorized Representative\" \u2014to pursue an appeal on the Member's behalf. An Appeal Representative may make all decisions regarding the Member's appeal, provide and obtain correspondence, and authorize the release of medical records and any other information related to their appeal. In addition, if the Member chooses to authorize an Appeal Representative, the Member has the right to limit their authority to release and receive the Member's medical records or other appeal information in any other way the Member identifies. In order to authorize someone to be the Member's Appeal Representative, the Member must complete valid authorization forms. The required forms are sent to adult Members or to the KE 670 SG EXC HMO Gold Premier 105 parents, guardians or other legal representatives of minor or incompetent Members who appeal and indicate that they want an Appeal Representative. Authorization forms can be obtained by calling or writing to the address listed below: Member Appeals Department P.O. Box 41820 Philadelphia, PA 19101 -1820 Toll Free : 1-888-671-5276 Fax: 1-888-671-5274 Except in the case of an Expedited appeal, the Health Benefit Plan must receive completed, valid authorization forms before the Member's appeal can be processed. (For information on Expedited appeals, see the de finition below and the references in the Member Complaint Appeal Process and Member Grievance Appeal Process sections bel ow.) The Member has the right to withdraw or rescind authorization of an Appeal Representative at any time during the process. If the Member's Provider files an appeal on the Member's behalf, the Health Benefit Plan will verify that the Provider is acting as the Member's Appeal Representative with their permission by obtaining valid authorization forms. A Member who authorizes the filing of an appeal by a Provider cannot file a separate appeal. Information for the A ppeal Review: How to File and Get Assistance - Appeals may be submitted by the Member or their Appeal Representative with the Member's authorization by following the steps ou tlined below in the descriptions of the Member Complaint Appeal Process and Member Grievance A ppeal Process. At any time during these appeal processes, the Member may request the help of a Health Benefit Plan employee in preparing or presenting their appeal; this assistance will be available at no charge. Please note that the Health Benefit Plan em ployee designated to assist the Member will not have participated in the previous decision to deny coverage for the issue in dispute and will not be a subordinate of the original reviewer. Full and Fair Review - The Member or designee is entitled to a full and fair review. Specifically, at all appeal levels the designee may submit additional information pertaining to the case, to the Health Benefit Plan. The Member or designee may specify the remedy or corrective action being sought. At the Member's request, the Health Benefit Plan will provide access to and copies of all relevant documents, records, and other information that are not confidential, proprietary, or pr ivileged. The Health Benefit Plan will automatically provide the Member or designee with any new or additional evidence considered, relied upon, or generated by the plan in connection with the appeal, which is used to formulate the rationale. Such evidence is provided as soon as possible and in advance of the date the adverse notification is issued. This information is provided to the Member or designee at no charge. Advanced Notice - The Health Benefit Plan will not terminate or reduce an-ongoing course of treatment without providing the Member or designee with advance notice and the opportunity for advanced review. Urgent Care - An urgent expedited appeal is any appeal for Medical Care or treatment with respect to which the application of the time periods for making non -urgen t determinations could seriously jeopardize the life or health of the Member or the ability of the Member to regain maximum function, or in the opinion of a Physician with knowledge of the Membe r's medical condition, would subject the Member to severe pain that cannot be adequately managed without the care or treatment that is the subject of the appeal. Members with KE 670 SG EXC HMO Gold Premier 106 Urgent Care conditions or who are receiving an on -going course of treatment may proceed with an expedited external review a t the same time as the internal expedited appeals process. Changes in Member Appeals Processes - Please note that the Members Appeal processes described here may change at any time due to changes in the applicable state and federal laws and regulations an d/or accreditation standards, to improve or facilitate the Members Appeals processes, or to reflect other decisions regarding the administration of Members Appeal processes for this Program. Appeal Decision Letters - If the Member's appeal request is not gr anted in full, the letter states the reason(s) for the decision. If a benefit provision, internal, rule, guideline, protocol, or other similar criterion is used in making the determination, the Member may request copies of this information at no charge. If the decision i s to uphold the denial, there is an explanation of the scientific or clinical judgment for the determination. The letter also indicates the qualifications of the individual who decided the appeal and their understanding of the nature of the appeal. The Mem ber or designee may request in writing, at no charge, the name of the individual who participated in the decision to uphold the denial. Appeal Classifications . The two classifications of appeals - Complaint s and Grievances - established by Pennsylvania state laws and regulations are described in detail in separate sections below. A Grievance appeal may be filed when the denial of a Covered Service is based primarily on Medical Necessity. A Complaint appeal may be filed to challenge a denial based on a Contract Limitation or to complain about other aspects of health plan policies or operations.

Potential Impact of State Law The HIPAA Privacy Rule generally does not \"preempt\" (or take precedence over) state privacy or other applicable laws that provide individuals greater privacy protections. As a result, to the extent state law applies, the privacy laws of a particular state, or other federal laws, rather than the HIPAA Privacy Rule, might impose a privacy standard under which we will be required to operate. For example, where such laws have been enacted, we will follow more stringent state privacy laws that relate to uses and dis closures of the protected health information concerning HIV or AIDS, mental health, substance abuse/chemical dependency, genetic testing, reproductive rights, etc. How We May Use and Disclose Your Protected Health Information (PHI) In order to administer our health benefit programs effectively, we will collect, use and disclose PHI for certain of our activities, including payment of covered services and health care operations.
