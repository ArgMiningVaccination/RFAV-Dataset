The Lot encompasses approximately 14.109 acres bordered on the north, west and south sides by Kuhio Highway and on the east by a portion of the Hanalei National Wildlife Refuge. The Lot was purchased by Helios Hanalei LLC (\"Helios\"), the applicant here, from the Richard Carlson Living Trust in November 2016. The Lot is located in the State Conservation District, Resource Subzone and the Special Management Area (\"SMA\") as defined within Hawaii Revised Statutes (\"HRS\") Chapter 205A. The parcel is undeveloped, except for an entrance gate and a rock wall along a small portion of the perimeter abutting Kuhio Highway constructed in accordance with Conservation District Use Permit CDUP-KA3729 approved by the State of Hawaii Board of Land and Natural Resources on April 20, 2015. HELIOS intends to apply to the Board of Land and Natural Resources for a Conservation District Use Permit (the \"CDUP\") to construct a 5-bedroom single-family residence and related improvements on the Lot (the \"proposed project\") under Hawaii Administrative Rules (\"HAR\") \u00a7\u00a713-5-24(c) R-7 and 13-5-41. At present, there are no dwellings on the lot. Accordingly, a single-family dwelling 1s permissible under HAR \u00a7\u00a713-5-4l(b) and (c). As part of the approval process for the single-family residence, HAR \u00a713-5-31(a)(l) requires submission of a HRS Chapter 343 draft Environmental Assessment (\"EA\"). The Department of Land and Natural Resources Office of Conservation and Coastal Lands is the approving agency for the EA and the CDUP. The proposed Conservation District single-family dwelling would be located on a cleared and relatively flat area (the \"proposed site\" or \"project site\") near the center of the western portion of the Lot. Historically, the Lot has been unused. Today, the built environment surrounding the Lot includes commercial and public facilities as well as residential uses. Features of the proposed 5-bedroom single-family dwelling are designed to mm1m1ze its visual impact from the neighboring area and the Hanalei Valley floor. The proposed dwelling: 504629.4 (i) Is one story with a maximum height of 18 feet 1.5 inches above existing grade (almost 7 feet lower than the maximum of 25 feet prescribed in HAR \u00a713-5); (ii) Has 4,342 square feet of living space, and a 622 square foot in-ground purified saltwater swimming pool and spa/hot tub with a 32 square foot pool equipment area, for a total \"maximum developable area\" of 4,996 square feet (within the maximum of 5,000 square feet prescribed in HAR \u00a7 13-5); (iii) Is set back no less than 58 feet from Kuhio Highway (on the northeast boundary) and no less than 150 feet from the Hanalei-facing Lot boundary; 1 (iv) Is finished with materials which conform to the surrounding environment, including cedar shake roofing and exterior walls finished in teak siding, and lava rock privacy garden walls; (v) Contai~s 5 bedrooms, 5Yi bathrooms, 1 kitchen/dining room and 1 living room intended for residential use by the owners, their multi-generational family and friends; and (vi) Includes a landscape plan within the project site that includes large canopy trees and maintains all densely vegetated areas bordering Kuhio Highway, further allowing the structure to blend in with its surrounding environment. This draft EA proposes a finding of no significant impact. The key elements of this finding are as follows. 504629.4 Utilities, Infrastructure and Air Quality. Utilities, infrastructure and air quality are not materially impacted by the proposed dwelling, as the proposed improvement represents a small percentage of activity on this portion of Kuhio Highway and the broader Princeville area. Wastewater will be accommodated by an under ground, self\u00ad contained, extended aeration wastewater treatment system consistent with State Health Department requirements. Kuhio Highway is a paved road serving multiple residences and businesses. Drainage. The site appears to drain uniformly with no apparent ravines, defiles, indentations or drainages. There is no observable erosion occurring. The existing contours of the site will be maintained. No rain gutters will be installed on the dwelling thus allowing the rainwater from the roof to disburse across the property to be absorbed within the landscaping without concentrating to cause erosion. Therefore, rainfall will generally be absorbed on the site and storm water flow will continue as under existing conditions. The Lot is located within Flood Zone X, an area determined to be outside the 0.2% annual chance floodplain. On the extremely rare occasion that the purified saltwater swimming pool or spa/hot tub requires draining for repair work, the pool would be pumped on a day without rain and water will be pumped onto to a relatively flat area allowing most of the water to soak into land and excess will sheet\u00ad flow away from house. The effect might be similar to a large rain event but in no event would that purified saltwater from the-pool leave the boundaries of the Lot. Historic and Cultural Sites. The proposed project will have no significant impact on historic or cultural sites. The Lot has been undeveloped except for old government road sections and includes an unidentified pre-contact rock formation located in a dense guava forest located on the ridge overlooking the Hanalei Valley. The Lot was checked for an old Chinese cemetery, which was said to be located on or near the Lot, but substantial testing conducted by the applicant located nothing and the Kauai/Niihau Burial Council members and others who visited the Lot did not locate any evidence of burials on the Lot. HELIOS will be submitting to the State Historic Preservation Division (\"SHPD\") its Draft Archaeological Inventory Survey (\"AIS\") reviewing historic/cultural sites within the Lot concurrently with this EA will address the pre\u00ad contact historic property located in a dense guava grove on the Lot. Components of the 2 504629.4 Final Preservation Plan may include designating the area surrounding the pre-contact historic property as a buffer zone. The proposed home site is more than 200 feet from the perimeter of the buffer zone. The AIS and Preservation Plan explicitly contemplate. the construction of a single-family dwelling on the project site. The AIS included a survey of the Lot, subsurface testing of the project site and clearing/sketch mapping of the pre-contact historic property and found no additional evidence of historic or archeologically significant structures in the project site area. Flora and Fauna. There will be a positive impact on flora and fauna in the project site and surrounding area. The project site is almost exclusively covered with invasive vegetation and there is no evidence of native animal species residing within the site. The proposed project's landscape plan calls for elimination of the invasive species in the middle of the flat portion of the bluff where the single family residence will be located, which are currently mainly cleared, including the removal of strawberry guava, java plum and silver oak. Cliffside areas will remain densely forested to prevent erosion and sediment runoff and to reduce impacts to existing plants and animals. Visual and Aesthetic Resources. There will be minimal negative impact upon visual/scenic resources or aesthetic resources. The choice of a site set back from the sloped edge of the Lot, no less than 58 feet from the Lot boundary, the limitation of the dwelling to a single story, the choice of the dwelling's materials and colors and the plan for the surrounding foliage eliminate or adequately mitigate the visual impacts. 3 SECTION 1 BACKGROUND 1.1 INTRODUCTION Helios Hanalei LLC (\"HELIOS\") purchased the Lot (TMK No. (4) 5-4-004:032), in Princeville, Kauai, Hawaii from the Richard Carlson Living Trust in November 2016. The 14.109 acre Lot sits on a ridge on the east side of Hanalei Valley and is bordered on the north, west and south sides by Kuhio Highway (the principal transportation artery on the north and east shores of the island), on the east by the Hanalei National Wildlife Refuge. The Lot is located in the State Conservation District, Resource Subzone and within the Special Management Area (the \"SMA\"). For at least the last 50 years, the Lot has remained undeveloped and devoid of structures or improvements. HELIOS intends to apply to the Board of Land and Natural Resources for a Conservation District Use Permit (the \"COUP\") (i) to construct a single-family residence in the Conservation District under Hawaii Administrative Rules (\"HAR\") \u00a7\u00a713-5-24(c) R-7 and 13-5-41, for residential use by the owners, and their multi-generational family and friends, in compliance with HAR \u00a7 13-5-42, and (ii) to remove invasive species and in their place to plant native and endemic plants and trees in the project site pursuant to HAR \u00a7 13-5-22(b) P-4 (B-1), HAR \u00a713-5-22(b) P-13 (B-2) and HAR \u00a713-5-22(b) P-11 (B-1) (alternatively, this process would constitute Landscaping pursuant HAR\u00a7 13-5-23(c) L-2 (D-1)) ( collectively, the \"proposed project\"). As part of the approval process for the single\u00ad family residence, HAR \u00a7 13-5-31 ( a) requires submission of a Hawaii Revised Statutes (\"HRS\") Chapter 343 draft Environmental Assessment (\"EA\"). The Department of Land and Natural Resources Office of Conservation and Coastal Lands is the approving agency for the EA and the COUP. The proposed Conservation District single-family dwelling would be located on a gently sloping bluff (the \"proposed site\" or \"project site\") in the center of the western end of the Lot. Historically, the Lot has been left unused and with the relatively flat center portion where the house is to be located cleared and the balance densely vegetated predominately with invasive species. Presently, the built environment surrounding the proposed site includes a considerable amount of residential and other development, including the Princeville Shopping Center on the opposite (northeast) side of Kuhio Highway. 1.2 PROPERTY LEGAL BACKGROUND The Lot is comprised of a portion ofland covered by Land Patent Grant Number 4845 to Albert S. Wilcox; being a portion of the land deeded by Kamehameha IC to Charles Titcomb, Apana 2, February 12, 1856, and being a portion of Parcel 4-A. Historical uses of the Lot may have included pasture on the cleared portion, traditional travel to mauka/makai lands by trail or road (which may have traversed the Lot). Otherwise, the Lot has remained undeveloped and unused. 4 504629.4 The Lot boundaries were defined by the Kuhio Highway construction which likely happened in the 1940s. On November 1, 2016, HELIOS purchased the Lot from the Richard Carlson Revocable Trust dated December 14, 2004. The State of Hawaii Board of Land and Natural Resources (\"BLNR\"), the agency with regulatory authority over this parcel and all land use activities thereon, approved a Conditional Use Permit for the installation of a gate and rock wall at the entrance to the Lot on April 10, 2015. CDUP KA-3729. The County of Kauai has also issued an SMA minor permit for the property. SMA(M)-2015-33. The County of Kauai Water Department approved the installation of a water meter to serve the Lot and a Conveyance of Water Facility dated May 21, 2015 was recorded against the Lot in the Bureau of Conveyances as Document No. A-56870489. The water meter has been installed. Under HAR \u00a7\u00a713-5-24(c) R-7 and HAR 13-5-41, an owner may apply to BLNR for approval to construct one single-family dwelling upon land in the Resource Subzone of the Conservation District. The residence must meet design standards contained in HAR \u00a7 13-5 (HAR \u00a7 13-5-41(a)). The residence shall not be used for rental or any other commercial purposes, unless approved by BLNR. Transient vacation rentals are prohibited. (HAR \u00a7 13- 5-42). HELIOS will be submitting a CDUA for its proposed single-family dwelling and landscaping work to BLNR for approval. HELIOS plans to utilize an approved single\u00ad family dwelling only as a residence for the owners, their extended family and friends. There will be no rentals by the applicant, either long term or short term. 1.3 SURROUNDING BUILT ENVIRONMENT The built environment immediately adjacent to the Lot is a roadway (Kuhio Highway) and the Hanalei National Wildlife Refuge, including the Hanalei Valley Overlook. Development in the near vicinity of the proposed site includes residential, agricultural and commercial development, as well as community services providers. Hanalei Farms and Homesteads Directly across Kuhio Highway and surrounding the majority of the Lot are the Hanalei Garden Farms condominium and various homestead properties accessed from Kuhio Highway and Hanalei Plantation Road. These properties include homes, farm dwellings, other farm structures and agricultural activities. Hanalei Fire and Police Station The Hanalei Fire and Police Station, also known as Station 1, is located approximately 0.1 mile from the Lot. The County of Kauai Fire Department, Fire/Rescue/HazMat/Medical Response Operations program, provides fire protection and suppression, rescue (ocean and land), hazmat and emergency medical services (basic life support) as well as pre-fire planning and inspection. 5 504629.4 Princeville Shopping Center and Princeville Resort The Princeville Shopping Center is located approximately 0.5 mile to the northeast of the Lot on Kuhio Highway. The Princeville Shopping Center includes a United States Post Office, Foodland grocery store, gasoline station and other shops and restaurants. Less than 1 mile east from the Lot is the entrance to the Princeville Resort, which includes the St. Regis Princeville Resort, various condominium and subdivision homes and the Makai Golf Course. Hanalei National Wildlife Refuge and Hanalei Scenic Overlook Established in 1972, Hanalei National Wildlife Refuge (\"Refuge\") is the oldest of Kaua'i's three national wildlife refuges and is owned and maintained by the United States Fish and Wildlife Service (\"USFWS\"). The 917-acre Refuge is located mainly in the Hanalei River Valley and extends upslope to abut the eastern end of the Lot. The Refuge was established under the Endangered Species Act to conserve five endangered water birds that rely on the Hanalei Valley for nesting and feeding habitat: the koloa maoli (Hawaiian duck), the moorhen), stilt), and the nene (Hawaiian goose). Forty-five other species of birds (18 of which are introduced species) also utilize refuge habitat at some point throughout the year. The Refuge is not open for public access. Across Kuhio Highway from the Princeville Shopping Center, the scenic overlook of the Hanalei Valley provides public viewing of the Refuge and the valley. According to a draft 2002 Environmental Assessment of the a proposed relocation and expansion of the overlook, approximately 350 vehicles and four to ten tour busses were expected on the site daily (an estimated 900 visitors per day). A Kauai Island Utility Substation and transmission lines are located on the Refuge property near the eastern boundary of the Lot. Princeville Airport The Princeville Airport runway is approximately 2.5 miles east of the Lot. Although at present there are no regular commercial flights using the airport, there was regular commercial service in the past, which could be reintroduced. In addition, the airport is open to use by private aircraft and is regularly used by tour helicopters. SECTION 2 PROPOSED PROJECT, ALTERNATIVE ANALYSIS AND NO ACTION ALTERNATIVE 2.1 THE PROPOSED PROJECT Helios is proposing to construct a single-family dwelling on the Lot which is located in the State Conservation District (Resource Subzone). The dwelling would be located on a gently sloping bluff (the \"proposed site\" or \"project site\") in the center of the western end of the Lot. The proposed site is relatively flat (see topographic map included in Exhibit 1) and is 6 504629.4 covered with grasses, weeds and invasive species with no presence of native plant species. The site has been unused for at least the past 50 years. The Proposed Dwelling. The proposed single-family dwelling would be located at the western end of the Lot The proposed dwelling would be a single-story structure with maximum height of 18 feet 1.5 inches above existing grade (almost 7 feet lower than the maximum of 25 feet prescribed in HAR \u00a7 13-5). The structure would have a finished living space under roof of 4,342 square feet and an in-ground purified saltwater swimming pool and spa/hot tub of 622 square feet with a pool equipment area of 32 square feet, resulting in a \"total maximum developable area\" of 4,996 square feet (as reflected in Exhibit 1 ).1 The dwelling would be comprised of 5 bedrooms, 5'h bathrooms, 1 kitchen/dining room and 1 living room designed in a modular style for multi-generational living. The pool would be a standard in-ground pool with purified saltwater with an attached spa/hot tub and a free-standing pool equipment area. The pool, spa/hot tub and equipment area do not include significant above ground elements (i.e., there is no roofed structure, gazebo, cabana or outdoor shower incorporated into the pool and spa/hot tub design). The Topographic Map, the relevant Tax Map, Site Plans (including Landscape Plan) and Floor Plan for the residence are attached as Exhibit 1. Elevations showing the exterior of the dwelling, together with photographs of the project site with 20 foot story poles are included in Exhibit 1 . In addition, photographs from the perspective of various locations around Hanalei, including Waikoko, the Hanalei Pier, Hanalei Park and certain roads, are included in Exhibit 2 These photographs depict how the dwelling site would appear to the naked eye when viewed from the various points on the Hanalei Valley floor. Dwelling Exterior Finishes. The exterior walls of the dwelling are finished with teak siding (as shown in the elevations included in the Exhibit 1). Exterior windows and doors will be tinted glass (as shown in Exhibit 1 ). Exterior columns are teak wrapped concrete and privacy garden walls are lava rock. The roof is cedar shake, as shown in Exhibit 1. The driveway will be crushed coral at the existing grade. The Landscape Plan. The Landscape Plan (included in Exhibit 1) calls for removal of a portion of the existing invasive species within mainly cleared areas of the project site, the preservation of existing hala trees, and the planting of large canopy trees including milo and hala, loulu palms and other plants. (i) The project site would be planted with up to four (4) large canopy trees, including milo and hala trees near the house and in the circular driveway, and native loulu palms around the circular driveway as signature plants. Naupaka will be planted to enclose the pool equipment area. Existing Strawberry guava, Silver oak and Java plum, all invasive species, will be removed from the house site and immediate vicinity. Hala trees within the project site will be maintained to preserve the Hawaiian sense of place. The existing pasture area will be maintained in its current closely mowed condition. 1 This total includes the footprint of the home ( whether or not living space), as well as, the pool and equipment area, but excludes the driveway. No carport, garages, storage buildings, shed or other development structures are planned. 7 504629.4 (ii) The residence would have groupings of native loulu palms around the circular driveway. (iii) Areas outside the project site (the vast majority of the Lot, including all areas bounding the Kuhio Highway) will remain as densely vegetated to maintain visual privacy and to prevent erosion of sloped areas. Wastewater. Wastewater from the dwelling will be addressed using an underground, self\u00ad contained, extended aeration wastewater treatment system which processes all wastewater This system is summarized in Exhibit 3. The wastewater system will comply with Department of Health requirements for wastewater disposal at this location. Site Development -Excavation. The contours of the proposed site will not be altered, other than excavation of the area immediately beneath the proposed dwelling to accommodate its foundation and excavation of the swimming pool. 2.2 ALTERNATIVE ANALYSIS The Alternative Analysis is included in the environmental analysis to provide a basis to compare the proposed project. As an alternative to the proposed structure, Helios considered a two-story single-family dwelling of modem concrete and glass design located on the rim of the cleared bluff area nearest Hanalei which would maximize the value of the property and provide the most impressive panoramic views from the dwelling. Helios considered, but rejected as too intrusive to the community and environment, a two-story modem design with light colored concrete walls, a flat roofline, open glass railing lanais on the second story, and expansive reflective glass windows. Placement of this structure close to the western boundary of the Lot would have provided expansive panoramic Hanalei Valley and Hanalei Bay views but would also have been highly visible from the Hanalei Bay overlook, Kuhio Highway in the immediate vicinity of the home and also from numerous locations around Hanalei Town. Maintaining approximately the same total square footage of the home but stacked as a two-story structure would allow for a smaller footprint on the Lot but a significantly larger total impact on the community and environment. Among the potential impacts of this alternative design are: greater danger to bird-life from impacts with glass windows, both during the day and at night; greater light pollution from second floor windows at night; limited ability to shield outdoor lighting on a structure without eaves or significant overhangs; significantly greater scenic impact on the historic Kuhio Highway and Hanalei community; visibility from the Hanalei Bay overlook and potentially from the Hanalei Valley overlook; and a design which does not blend with the environment. 2.3 NO ACTION ALTERNATIVE The No Action Alternative is included in the environmental analysis to provide a basis to compare the proposed project. In the No Action Alternative, there would be no disturbance of the existing environment. At present, many of the invasive species on the proposed site have been cut and grasses mowed. The No Action Alternative would permit invasive species existing on the site to once again spread to cover the site, eventually eliminating the open grassy areas. 8 504629.4 2.4 PROJECT LEGAL FRAMEWORK AND COMPLIANCE ANALYSIS Under HAR \u00a7\u00a7 13-5-24 and HAR 13-5-41, one single-family dwelling may be constructed upon land in the Conservation District with the approval of the BLNR. The dwelling may not be allowed, \"where there is an existing residence in a different state land use district zoned for residential, rural or agricultural use on another portion of the same legal lot of record\" (HAR \u00a713-5-41(c)). The residence must meet design standards contained in HAR \u00a713-5 (HAR \u00a713-5-41(a)). The design standards, among other things, limit the \"maximum developable area\" to 5,000 square feet for lots larger than one acre and limit the height of any part of the structure (with certain exceptions) to the \"maximum allowable building envelope\", which is 25 feet above the existing grade. A single-family dwelling must receive a Board Permit (HAR \u00a713-5-24(c)). A Board Permit, among other things, requires submittal of a draft or final EA (HAR \u00a7 13-5- 31 ( a)(l)). The Board Permit for a single-family dwelling in the Resource Subzone does not require a public hearing (HAR \u00a7 13-5-40(a)); provided, however, that public hearings shall be held on all applications determined by the chairperson that the scope of use or the public interest requires a hearing on the application (HAR \u00a713-5-40(a)(4)). There are no existing dwellings or structures, other than a rock wall and driveway gate, on the Lot constructed in accordance with Conservation District Use Permit CDUP-KA3729 approved by the State of Hawaii Board of Land and Natural Resources on April 20, 2015. Accordingly, since there is no existing residence on portion of the Lot, the proposed single\u00ad family residence satisfies the requirements of HAR \u00a7 13-5-41 (b) and ( c ). The proposed dwelling the \"compatibility provisions\" of HAR \u00a713-5. In particular: 504629.4 (i) landscaping will screen much of the structure from the perspective of Kuhio Highway, the dwelling will not be visible from Hanalei Town and, to the extent the dwelling would be visible from beaches, parks and roads within Hanalei Valley, the combination of foliage about the structure, setback from the sloped edges of the Lot and the property boundary, single story construction, and choice of materials for the roof and exterior walls will obscure the dwelling such that it will not be readily discernible to the naked eye from its surroundings; (ii) the roof will be cedar shake and the exterior walls teak paneling sufficient to blend with the environment; (iii) the waste water system will comply with and be approved by the Department of Health; (iv) the general contours of the proposed site will not be altered ( except for the construction within the area of the dwelling itself, the in-ground swimming pool and spa/hot tub; (v) only one dwelling will be constructed; (vi) all use restrictions, building code and grading code requirements will be followed; and 9 (vii) there will be only one kitchen. While limited removal of invasive species is permitted in the Resource Subzone without a permit, any future significant alteration to the landscaping of the property, including, but not limited to, the clearing of vegetation which screens views of the structure from outside the property, will require the owner to submit a new CDUA to the BLNR if the BLNR determines this clearing could have a significant negative secondary impact on the natural or cultural resources or the surrounding community. (HAR \u00a713-5-24). The residence shall not be used for rental or any other commercial purposes, unless approved by BLNR. Transient vacation rentals are prohibited. (HAR \u00a7 13-5-42). SECTION 3 PHYSICAL ENVIRONMENTAL SETTING, IMPACTS AND PROPOSED MITIGATION 3.1 TOPOGRAPHY, SOILS, GEOLOGY, RAINFALL Existing Condition Like many other valleys on Kauai, Hanalei Valley was created largely by stream erosion. It stretches from Hanalei Bay to Mount Waialeale, a distance of approximately ten miles. The valley is widest at the bay, narrowing inland. Alluvial deposits and the effects of sea level changes helped form the valley's flat floor. Because of this flat terrain, and wetland conditions, the valley floor is presently used primarily for endangered water bird management by the US Fish and Wildlife Service as the Hanalei National Wildlife Refuge and wetland taro cultivation. The valley floor was also used to cultivate sugarcane, coffee and rice from the early 1800s through the 20th century. The Hanalei River, which meanders through the Hanalei Valley floor, is located approximately 150 feet from the southeastern comer of the Lot. The Hanalei River is the fourth largest river in the State based upon the amount of water discharged (Stream Assessment Draft Report of 1990, State of Hawaii and National Park Service: 27) and, in 1998, was designated as one of seven American Heritage Rivers by Executive Order 13061. The Princeville area to the north of the Lot is in residential, commercial and resort uses. Princeville Shopping Center, directly to the northeast of the Lot, is the primary commercial resource center for the Princeville community. The Lot, located west of the Hanalei Valley Lookout, includes all of the land within the horseshoe curve of Kuhio Highway which leads down to the Hanalei River and Hanalei town. The western end of the Lot is a gently sloping bluff. It was cleared of woody vegetation by previous owners and is maintained as a periodically mowed grass field. The Lot currently has no improvements except a rock wall gated entry with a gravel driveway leading to the bluff area constructed in accordance with Conservation District Use Permit CDUP-KA3729 approved by the State of Hawaii Board of Land and Natural Resources on April 20, 2015. Topography, Soils and Geology. The majority of the Lot is gently sloping terrain falling from 10 504629.4 approximately 471 feet of elevation to about 460 feet of elevation resulting in an overall maximum gradient of seven percent (7%). This gently sloping bluff area is the planned site of the residence. The remainder of the. Lot is steeply sloped and heavily forested. The Lot is located on an ancient wave-cut terrace underlain by lava flows associated with Mount Namahana, an extinct, secondary volcanic vent structurally connected to Mount Wai'ale'ale, the principal volcano that created the island of Kauai. The volcanic rocks have been altered by chemical processes to form thick zones of saprolite. The soil mantle overlying the saprolite formation is composed of a silty clay or silt assigned to the Makapili series. This soil is characterized by a low shrink/swell potential but high corrosion potentials with respect to uncoated steel and concrete. The erosion hazard is considered slight to moderate on slopes of the inclination typical of the bluff portion of the Lot where the residence is to be located. A Geotechnical Report dated May 22, 2017 was prepared by JPB Engineering, Inc. and is attached as Exhibit 4. A Phase I Environmental Assessment dated July 7, 2017 was prepared by Pacific Greene Environmental Inc and is attached as Exhibit 5. Slope mitigation work covering approximately 3 acres of the Lot was done by the State of Hawaii pursuant to a Right of Entry Agreement dated August 16, 2004 recorded against the Lot as Document No. 2006-085546. This Right of Entry granted the State temporary use of a portion of the Lot for slope mitigation work along Kuhio Highway for protection of the highway from rockfalls. A Grant of Easement to the State of Hawaii granted Slope Easement 1 for the maintenance of the slope mitigation work and recorded as Document No. 2010-000301. The completed physical improvements of this mitigation work consist mainly of anchors, cables and steel mesh netting and will remain in place preventing erosion on the covered areas and eliminating rockfalls onto the highway. Helios plans no alterations to the Lot which will impact or alter the likelihood of erosion or rockfalls from the Lot. More information on the slope stabilization work can be for in the Final Environmental Assessment Kuhio Highway Slope Stabilization January 2009. Rainfall; Ground Water. The parcel receives approximately 78 inches of annual rainfall (University of Hawaii Rainfall Atlas). There is no evidence of significant surface flows to the Lot originating from neighboring properties. There may be some drainage from Kuhio Highway on the northeast side of the Lot. Test borings on the Lot showed no free ground water. The Lot may have seeps and springs but none have been observed. The project site is rated Flood Zone X. Zone Xis a Special Flood Hazard Area determined to be outside the 500-year floodplain as shown on the FIRM Map attached hereto as Exhibit 6. Flood insurance purchases are not required. The nearest floodplain is within Hanalei Valley. Potential Impacts and Mitigation 11 504629.4 The Proposed Project Topography. The dwelling and surrounding landscaping will be designed to conform to the existing contours of the project site and not materially alter the existing topography. The only permanent alteration of the site's contours will be for the foundation of the dwelling itself and for the in-ground swimming pool and spa/hot tub. The Landscape Plan will not require any material modification of the existing terrain or excavation. Soils and Geology. The proposed dwelling will not change the soils of the project site or the surrounding areas. The soil condition of the project site is suitable for the proposed single\u00ad family dwelling. Rainfall, Drainage and Natural Hazards. The existing contours of the site will be maintained. Therefore, rainfall will generally be absorbed on the site and storm water in extreme conditions will continue to flow in existing directions discharging to Kuhio Highway, as under the current circumstances. No rain gutters will be installed on the dwelling, except limited gutters immediately above the front entrance, thus allowing the rainwater from the roof to disburse evenly across the property to be absorbed within the soil and landscaping without concentrating to cause erosion. Slope mitigation work covering approximately 3 acres of the Lot within the drainage area was done by the State of Hawaii pursuant to a Right of Entry Agreement dated August 16, 2004 recorded against the Lot as Document No. 2006-085546 and will remain unaltered in place. Potential Pool Water Drainage. Neither the purified saltwater swimming pool nor the spa/hot tub will be drained on a regular basis. Each is designed for maintenance and cleaning of the purified saltwater within the pool or spa/hot tub respectively. On the extremely rare occasion that the purified saltwater swimming pool or spa/hot tub requires draining for repair work, the pool or the spa/hot tub would be pumped on a day without rain and water would be pumped onto to a relatively flat landscaped area to allow most of the purified saltwater to soak into land and excess water to sheet-flow away from the house to be absorbed by the soil. The effect might be similar to a large rain storm in the event of a complete draining of the pool, less for a partial draining event or for the spa/hot tub, but in no event will purified saltwater from the pool would leave the boundaries of the Lot. The proposed project will not increase the risk of natural hazards (i.e., landslides) due to the very limited alteration of site drainage, location of the dwelling on the level portion of the Lot and the maintenance of the existing slope stabilization improvements. No Action The No Action Alternative would not change the existing topography, soils, drainage or natural hazards of the project site. 12 504629.4 3.2 WATER RESOURCES Existing Condition The project site contains no surface water bodies or wetlands. A botanical survey of the site found no evidence of wetland vegetation. The surface water bodies nearest to the project site are Hanalei River, which meanders along the valley floor to the south of the Lot, and the river's adjacent wetlands. The river is designated a National Heritage River. The Hawaii Stream Assessment (1990) evaluated Hanalei River as having outstanding aquatic natural resources. The valley wetlands are used to cultivate taro and provide habitat for endangered water birds. The nearest coastline, Hanalei Bay, is approximately 1.3 miles distant. Princeville Resort has an irrigation pond associated with the golf course that is located approximately 0.5 mile from the Lot. The County of Kauai Water Department approved the installation of a water meter to serve the Lot and a Conveyance of Water Facility dated May 21, 2015 was recorded against the Lot in the Bureau of Conveyances as Document No. A-56870489. The water meter has been installed. There are no groundwater wells or injection wells on the Lot. Potential Impacts and Mitigation Proposed Project The proposed project will have no significant direct or indirect impact on the Hanalei River, the adjacent valley wetlands or the coastal waters (including Hanalei Bay). Potable water will be supplied to the Lot by the County of Kauai Water Department approved water meter. No Action The No Action Alternative would not impact the Hanalei River, the Hanalei Valley wetlands or the coastal waters because this alternative would propose no construction. 3.3 FLORA Existing Condition The vegetation covering the eastern two-thirds of the Lot is mostly mixed, secondary forest with a generally sparse understory. Between the Kuhio highway verge of the upper arm of the loop and the steep slopes along the lower arm is a closed or nearly closed canopy forest of mostly introduced tree species: mango (Mangifera indica), avocado, gunpowder tree (Terma orientalis). Also common in this area are native or Polynesian-introduced (\"canoe plants\") hala (Pandanus hau (hibiscus tilaceus). 13 504629.4 Much of the project area on the western third of the Lot has been cleared and is close-cropped grassy field with a few scattered trees. This area was once covered in strawberry guava (Psidium cattleianum) scrubland. This scrubland extended over much of the western third of the Lot and surrounds the project area. A portion of the west-facing slope, extending below the project area to the highway, supports a mixture of trees and mostly shrubs, with wait-a-bit (Caesalpinia decapetala) prominent. Scattered ornamentals are present, planted especially along the residence entrance driveway. A Natural Resources Surveys report, dated June 14, 2017, was prepared by AECOS, Inc. It is attached as Exhibit 7. Between surveys conducted in 2008 and 2017, 12 species of fems and 120 taxa of flowering plants were identified on the Lot, representing all plants identified in both surveys. Four of the 12 species of fems identified are native species (indigenous or endemic). Among the flowering plants, 6 indigenous and no endemics are listed. Early Polynesian introductions total 5 flowering plants. None of these species is considered rare in the Hawaiian Islands. Potential Impacts and Mitigation Proposed Project The proposed project's Landscape Plan would positively impact the project site flora. No species that is listed by the state or federal governments endangered species statutes or considered a candidate species, or is rare, or is of any special concern was observed at the Lot. Therefore, no mitigation measures are proposed based on specifics of the observed flora. The Lot does support a number of old hala trees that provide an ambiance of a Hawaiian sense of place. These trees will be preserved to the extent possible and supplemented with the planting of additional hala and milo trees. These trees are sparsely scattered around the project area and are prominent in parts of the steep-sloped eastern half of the Lot away from the project area. The plan proposes continued control of invasive plant species covering the project site and the reintroduction of some native species. No Action The property remains dominated by invasive grasses, shrubs and trees which will be permitted to spread throughout the Lot. 3.4 FAUNA Existing Condition During stationary point-counts, nine species were observed utilizing the Lot and an additional five species were encountered while traversing the Lot between count stations: Spotted Dove (Streptopelia Hawaiian or nene (Branta sandvicensis) is common in nearby Hanalei National Wildlife Refuge and around the Princeville golf courses. Two seabirds -the Hawaiian newelli) -regularly fly over the region but were not observed during the survey. No mammals or signs of their presence were detected on the Lot during the survey. A domestic dog (Canis l. familiaris) was heard barking, the sound originating from houses north of the Lot, across Kuhio Highway. The Hawaiian hoary bat (Lasiurus cinerius semotus) is an endangered species that is fairly common in the lowlands of Kauai. Although not detected during the course of surveying the Lot, it is likely that this endangered species uses resources in the general area. Hawaiian hoary bats are foliage\u00ad roosting, over-disbursed mammals; that is, they roost in low numbers widely separated from one another. A Natural Resources Surveys report, dated June 14, 2017, was prepared by AECOS, Inc. It is attached as Exhibit 7. Potential Impacts and Mitigation Proposed Project The proposed project will not adversely impact fauna in the area of the project site. To the contrary, the introduction of large blooming canopy trees may provide harborage and forage for native forest bird species. Also, maintenance of the project area in short grass will provide harborage for native birds, including the Koloa, and Nene, both common in the Princeville and Hanalei area. In the event that any endangered species were found on the property, such as the Nene, all current occupants of the property would comply with all legal protections of endangered species, including the federal Endangered Species Act and Hawaii Revised Statutes Chapter 195D. As an example, outdoor activities which could threaten or disturb a Nene found on the open grassy areas of the Lot would cease in the vicinity of the bird until the Nene chose to leave the area on its own. The proposed project is also not anticipated to adversely impact threatened or endangered mammal species. Removal of vegetation within the Lot may temporarily displace bats using trees for roosting. However, these bats use multiple roosts within their home territories and disturbance from the removal of a roosting tree is likely to be minimal. An exception is the removal of trees during the bat pupping season. The following recommendations are planned for the project: 15 504629.4 Exterior lighting will be shielded to reduce interactions with Hawaiian petrels and Newell's shearwaters moving between inland nesting sites and the ocean. Shielding will be accomplished by limiting exterior lighting to fixtures under the eaves or soffits which point downward. No sconces or up lighting will be used as exterior lighting. The eaves of the dwelling are 6 feet wide, significantly larger than typical home eave overhangs, which helps to shield downward pointing exterior lights and interior lights. The dwelling also utilizes tinted glass windows which helps to block interior lighting from escaping outwards. No tiki torches will be installed in the landscaping. To the extent that trees taller than 15 feet will be removed, which trees may provide roosting sites for Hawaiian hoary bats, this action will be scheduled for periods not within the Hawaiian hoary bat pupping season of June 1 through September 15. No Action Alternative Under the No Action Alternative, the project site would repopulate with invasive species with limited harborage and forage for native species, including the regrowth of dense vegetation within the currently mowed areas. 3.5 AIR QUALITY AND NOISE Existing Condition HELIOS is not aware of any air quality issues concerning the proposed site. Additionally, there are no industrial sources of noise near the project site, other than periodic construction activity. Potential Impacts and Mitigation Proposed Project During construction, noise at the proposed site will be the typical levels associated with construction of a single-family dwelling and related improvements and HELIOS will comply with all applicable legal and regulatory requirements related to noise levels. Once the dwelling is completed, noise emissions will be minimal and impacts to neighboring properties will not be significant. Once constructed, the types of noise that will be generated at the dwelling would include cars moving in and out of the site and the periodic operation of landscaping maintenance equipment, such as lawnmowers, blowers, etc. Periodic use of such equipment is common within the project neighborhood. During construction of the proposed dwelling, BMPs will be used to minimize any dust or similar air borne material and HELIOS will comply with all applicable legal and regulatory requirements related to air pollution control and fugitive dust emissions. Once the proposed dwelling is completed, the dwelling and vehicles entering and exiting the dwelling will have no significant impact on pollutant air emissions. 16 504629.4 No Action The No Action Alternative would not change existing noise levels or pollutant air emissions. 3.6 UTILITIES AND ROADS Existing Condition There is no sewer service along this portion of Kuhio Highway. State Health Department regulations require that a septic system may not be located within 1,000 feet of a public potable water well. Potable water for residences along this portion of Kuhio Highway is provided by the Kauai County Department of Water. Installation of water meter facilities has been approved by the Department of Water and a Conveyance of Water Facility was recorded in the Bureau of Conveyances as Document No. A-56870489 on July 28, 2015 and the water meter has been installed. Kauai Island Utility Cooperative (\"KIUC\") provides electric power service to this area of Kuhio Highway. Kuhio Highway is a public road owned by the State of Hawaii. Potential Impacts and Mitigation Proposed Project The proposed dwelling does not materially impact utilities and roads. The County of Kauai does not provide wastewater treatment services to this area. Domestic waste water from the proposed dwelling would be processed by an underground, self\u00ad contained, extended aeration wastewater treatment system. The system will be in compliance with State Department of Health and County requirements for a single-family dwelling at this location. Installation of water meter facilities has been approved by the Department of Water and a Conveyance of Water Facility was recorded in the Bureau of Conveyances as Document No. A-56870489 on July 28, 2015 and the water meter was installed. KIUC has approved plans for electrical service to the proposed dwelling. The addition of the residence should have no material impact on wear of or traffic on Kuhio Highway. The volume of traffic from one single-family dwelling will be immaterial to the current Kuhio Highway traffic. Like the entrance to the nearby Hanalei Valley Overlook, no specific traffic modifications are planned for Kuhio Highway for vehicles turning into the Lot. Unlike the well-used Hanalei Valley Overlook, instances of vehicles turning into the Lot will be infrequent. Up to three vehicles can pull into the driveway and stop before the gate is opened to allow vehicles to proceed further into the property, 17 504629.4 eliminating the need for vehicles to wait in the street while the gate is opened. No significant traffic delays are anticipated due to vehicles turning into the Lot. Vehicles leaving the Lot will have little to no impact on traffic flow. The existing driveway accesses Kuhio Highway adjacent to the current location of the gate which is closed for public safety to curtail traffic passing along Kuhio Highway when the Hanalei River floods at the nearby Hanalei Bridge (the \"flood gate\"), a not infrequent occurrence. Because both the driveway and the flood gate are currently in existence, the inclusion of a single-family dwelling within the Lot will not affect the traffic along Kuhio Highway in the event of the closure of the flood gate. Like the rest of the public, the Lot owner would not have access to Hanalei Town across the Hanalei Bridge in the event of the closure of the flood gate, but can proceed toward Princeville. In the event of road closure, drivers sometimes use the area fronting the driveway gate to tum around and can continue to do so after the dwelling is constructed. No Action The No Action Alternative would not change the existing use of utilities and roads, including no change to the impact the existing driveway may have on public safety during the closure of the flood gate. SECTION 4 SOCIAL ENVIRONMENTAL SETTING,IMPACTS AND PROPOSED MITIGATION 4.1 POPULATION CHARACTERISTICS Existing Condition The town of Princeville was developed starting in the late 1960s. It includes two major hotels (the St. Regis Princeville and the Westin), over 1,500 time-share and condominium properties, and over 700 single-family residences. Princeville's population in 2010 was 2,158. Princeville includes a commercial area, the 74,000 square foot Princeville Shopping Center, which includes a 24,666 square foot Foodland supermarket, an ACE Hardware store and numerous other small businesses and restaurants. Hanalei is a much older community. The community had approximately 300 residences in 2010. The area often referred to as Hanalei Town supports a small commercial district with shops, restaurants and other businesses. The remainder of the Hanalei Valley is very rural and scenic and includes a National Wildlife Refuge, some residences and taro farms. The County of Kaua'i General Plan projects a resident population ranging from between 65,300 to 82,800 for the year 2020 based on data from the 1990s (section 1.6.2.2 County of Kauai General Plan). The U.S. Census Bureau for 2010 estimates the population for 2020 to be 75,640 residents, which is slightly more than the maximum projection from 1997 (Table 2-1). 18 504629.4 Potential Impacts and Mitigation Proposed Project The addition of one single-family residence in Princeville/Hanalei will have no significant impact on population metrics of the area. No Action The No Action Alternative does not impact population metrics. 4.2 TRAFFIC CONDITIONS Existing Condition The Lot and the project site are located on Kuhio, a State-owned, paved road. Kuhio Highway in this general vicinity(+/- 1 mile) has numerous commercial structures, residential dwellings and other structures, located along it, including the Princeville Shopping Center and Hanalei Fire and Police Station. Hanalei Plantation Road intersects with Kuhio Highway opposite from the northern boundary of the Lot and adjacent to the Hanalei Fire and Police Station. The Lot has a long used State approved driveway entrance onto Kuhio Highway. A gate and rock wall have been constructed at the driveway site in accordance with Conservation District Use Permit CDUP-KA3729 approved by the State of Hawaii Board of Land and Natural Resources on April 20, 2015. Potential Impacts and Mitigation Proposed Project The introduction of one single-family dwelling to the community will have no significant impact on existing traffic conditions on Kuhio Highway. The incremental use associated with the proposed single-family dwelling is inconsequential. No Action The No Action Alternative will not alter existing use of Kuhio Highway. 4.3 HISTORIC AND CULTURAL PROPERTIES Existing Condition The adjacent Kuhio Highway, also known as the Kauai Belt Road, is on the National Register of Historic Places, as is the nearby Hanalei Bridge. Their applicable criteria include A (property associated with events that have made a significant contribution to the broad pattern of our history) and C (property embodies the distinctive characteristics of a type, period, or method of construction or represents the work of a master, or possesses high artistic values, or represents a significant and distinguishable entity whose components lack individual distinction) with significance for engineering, social history, transportation and commerce. The Kuhio Highway between Princeville and Ha'ena is part of the original belt road system and retains its historic significance and character in its location, alignment, 19 504629.4 design, setting and association. The project will not affect the location, alignment, design, setting or association of the historic roadway as the improvements on the Lot will be minimally visible from the roadway and no alterations will be made to Kuhio Highway. An Archaeological Inventory Survey (\"AIS\") covering the Lot, was completed in July 2017 by Exploration Associates, Ltd and is attached as Exhibit 8. While two historic properties were located within the Lot, no cultural materials or historic properties were found during the surface and subsurface work in the project area. Trenches were excavated within the footprint of the single-family residence, the swimming pool location, the site of the wastewater treatment system and other utility locations. The AIS noted - The project area is defined as the single-family residence including the swimming pool and ancillary improvements. Currently the project area is fairly level and maintained in grass. Subsurface testing ( 6 backhoe trenches) were placed in the location of the proposed development. No cultural material or historic properties were found during the surface and subsurface work in the project area. Within the parcel, two historic properties were identified: Old Government Road portion (50-30-03-02353) and a pre-contact historic structure comprised of a rock formation (50-30-03-02354). The location of these historic properties is well outside of the development area but on the Lot. SIHP# 50-30-03-2353 is an old road documented as significant under criteria D (for its information content. From the historic documentation, this road appears to be built before 1833. Its use was mostly abandoned when the new Kauai Belt Road was constructed. Occasionally it was used as an emergency route. No further work is recommended for this historic property but because of its location, it is being indirectly being preserved \"as is\". SIHP# 50-30-03-02354 is an approximately 15 x 7-meter pre-contact historic property located in a dense area of guava forest near the northern point of the property. SIHP# 50-30-03-02354 is significant under multiple criteria D and E (E being significant to the Native Hawaiian culture). Four features have been identified with that historic property. Two mounds, one rock wall and several rough stones outline a rough boundary of the historic property. A preservation plan is recommended for this historic property, with further detailed mapping with appropriate buffers and will be maintained by the owner. The State Historic Preservation Division has recommended a preservation plan including a buffer zone to safeguard the pre-contact historic property from future adverse activities in 20 504629.4 the surrounding area, which Helios has agreed to implement. In setting the buffer zone, the AIS and preservation plan expressly considered the planned residential dwelling. A cultural impact assessment was also conducted for. this parcel. No traditional cultural practices have been documented for this property. Interviews with informants stated that in modem times the area did have some occasional pig hunting, guava and sisal collecting and cannabis growing. It was a heavily overgrown area and most informants did not recall much about the area and had little access nor reason to frequent that parcel. A few informants mentioned they thought there was a Chinese cemetery and other informants stated there was an ahu or heiau on this parcel. The cultural impact assessment can be found in Exhibit 9. Potential Impacts and Mitigation Proposed Project There should be no significant impact on historic or cultural sites. As mentioned, the AIS identified no historic properties or structures on the project site. The buffer zone around the pre-contact historic structure safeguards the historic preserve from uses of the Lot, including construction activities. No Action The No Action Alternative would not impact historic properties and would leave the pre\u00ad contact historic property overgrown and undistinguishable. 4.4 VISUAL AND AESTHETIC RESOURCES: IMPACT ON THE AREA Existing Condition Kuhio Highway borders three sides of the Lot. The area of the Lot abutting Kuhio Highway is a densely vegetated margin which will remain in place for privacy and to lessen the visual impact of the project on Kuhio Highway. There are currently no dwellings on the Lot. Extensive residential, community and commercial development on Kuhio Highway exists to the northeast of the Lot, including: (i) the Princeville Shopping Center; (ii) the Hanalei Fire and Police Station; and (iii) multiple farms and residences on Hanalei Plantation Road which runs perpendicular to Kuhio Highway. One residence is planned for the Lot. The residence will be only minimally visible from Kuhio Highway, including the nearby Hanalei Valley lookout. 21 504629.4 Analysis/Mitigation Proposed Project The proposed project will have no significant impact on the neighborhood in this area of Kuhio Highway. One residence is planned for the Lot. Accordingly, there will be no further residential development within the 14.109 acres comprising the Lot. The proposed dwelling is only one story with a maximum height of 18 feet 1.5 inches ( almost 7 feet lower than the maximum of 25 feet prescribed in HAR \u00a7 13-5). The home will be set no less than 58 feet from the Lot boundary and within the dense vegetation border along Kuhio Highway, which will remain undisturbed. Given the vegetation along Kuhio Highway and around the residence and the roofing and exterior materials used, the proposed residence will blend into its surroundings and will be largely obscured to passing vehicle and pedestrian traffic on Kuhio Highway. The proposed residence will not be visible from either the Hanalei Valley overlook or the Hanalei Bay overlook. Given the proximity to the busy Princeville Shopping Center (0.5 mi.), Hanalei Fire and Police Station (0.1 mi.) and multiple other residences, the nearby portion of Kuhio Highway is not a pristine, natural preserve; it is a developed residential and commercial area. While the Hanalei National Wildlife Refuge abuts the Lot, the proposed home is also at the far end of the Lot from the boundary of the Hanalei National Wildlife Refuge. In fact, the Princeville Shopping Center is significantly closer to the Hanalei National Wildlife Refuge and Hanalei Valley overlook than the proposed dwelling would be. As a result, the proposed single-family dwelling will have no material impact on the overall visual appearance of the area in terms of its existing \"natural\" condition. With respect to natural foliage, the area has been largely overtaken by invasive vegetation. No Action The No Action Alternative would not change the ex1stmg state of the area. Invasive vegetation would continue to populate and spread in and around the proposed site. 4.5 VISUAL AND AESTHETIC RESOURCES: IMPACT ON IMMEDIATELY ADJACENT PARCELS Existing Condition There are three (3) residences, the Hanalei Fire and Police Station and other undeveloped parcels immediately across Kuhio Highway from the driveway entrance to the Lot although the building site is not visible from these locations. Analysis/ Mitigation 22 504629.4 Proposed Project Due to the dense vegetation abutting Kuhio Highway, the proposed dwelling will not be visible from the three (3) residences, the Hanalei Fire and Police Station across the street. The dwelling may be visible from very limited locations along Kuhio Highway but will not be visible from the Hanalei Valley overlook or the Hanalei Bay overlook. Due the speed of traffic and lack of pedestrian use of these sections of Kuhio Highway ( outside the overlooks), any brief glimpses of the dwelling will have little to no impact on the scenic experience of residents and visitors traveling the Kuhio Highway. The dwelling will be partially visible, although mostly obscured by vegetation from undeveloped parcels below Kuhio Highway in Hanalei Valley. The impact on these undeveloped parcels depends in part on their future use, if any, but would be minimal in any event. No Action The No Action Alternative would not change the ex1stmg state of the area. Invasive vegetation would continue to populate and spread in and around the proposed site. 4.6 VISUAL AND AESTHETIC RESOURCES: IMPACT ON VIEWS FROM THE HANALEI VALLEY FLOOR Existing Condition There are several taro farms on the Hanalei Valley floor below the Lot. The Kuhio Highway runs east-west across the valley floor from Princeville to Hanalei. Ohiki Road runs south from the highway up the valley, providing access to the taro farms and USFWS property in the valley, including the Hanalei National Wildlife Refuge. Analysis/Mitigation Proposed Project While the project site is in a prominent location along the Hanalei Valley rim, the project site is set within the dense vegetation of the Lot, and therefore there are only very limited locations within the valley floor, Hanalei Town or its nearby beaches where one could potentially see the proposed dwelling. By limiting the dwelling to one story (with a maximum height of 18 feet 1. 5 inches -almost 7 feet lower than the maximum of 25 feet prescribed in HAR \u00a7 13-5), setting the structure back no less than 150 feet from the Hanalei-facing Lot boundary, and the maintenance of the dense vegetation margins of the Lot, the dwelling's visibility from these locations on the valley floor is mitigated if not eliminated. In addition, even if a portion of the dwelling or its roof could be observed from valley farms or roadways, the dwelling's impact is further mitigated by compliance with the applicable design standards referenced in HAR \u00a7 13-5-41, including using cedar shake roofing, teak 23 504629.4 siding on the walls, lava rock privacy garden walls and foliage around the dwelling which breaks the dwelling's roof lines. These mitigating measures prevent any visible portion of the structure from standing out from its natural surroundings. The mitigating effect of these design features is demonstrated by the photographs of the proposed site from various locations around Hanalei, including Waikoko, the Hanalei Pier, Hanalei Park and certain roads, are included in Exhibit 2. Each photograph is marked with the dwelling location and some have a rendering of the proposed dwelling superimposed on the site. The photographs depict how the proposed dwelling would appear to the naked eye from these points on the valley floor. These photographs include the existing dense vegetation surrounding the project area but do not include the large canopy trees which will be planted pursuant to the Landscape Plan. For purposes of comparison, it should be noted that there are numerous dwellings along Hanalei Plantation Road, particularly in the Hanalei Garden Farms development which includes 22 home sites. Several of these dwellings are readily visible from the Hanalei Valley floor and Hanalei Town. At night, it is possible the proposed dwelling's lights could be seen from parts of the Hanalei Valley floor (note, hundreds of lights in Hanalei are visible from the eastern valley rim). This impact would be mitigated by the surrounding vegetation, the residence's setback within the Lot, the Landscape Plan's use of foliage, and compliance with down lighting requirements for all exterior lights, including the use of 6 foot eaves on the dwelling and tinted glass windows which reduce the escape of interior lights outward. No Action The No Action Alternative would not change the appearance of the project site. SECTION 5 CUMULATIVE IMPACTS Cumulative impacts are two or more individual effect's which, when considered together, compound or increase the overall impact. The cumulative impacts of implementing the proposed project along with past and reasonably foreseeable future projects on the Lot are assessed based upon current available information. There are no construction projects planned for the Lot, other than the proposed single-family dwelling project. Accordingly, there are no cumulative impacts to be considered. SECTION 6 CONSISTENCY WITH GOVERNMENTAL PLANS, POLICIES AND CONTROLS This section summarizes the relationship of governmental plans and policies to the proposed project. 24 504629.4 6.1 HAWAII STATE PLANNING ACT The Hawai'i State Planning Act, HRS Chapter 226 (the \"State Plan\"), was developed as a guideline for the future growth of the State of Hawai'i. The State Plan identifies goals, objectives, policies, and priorities for the development and growth of the State. It provides a basis for prioritizing and allocating limited resources such as public funds, services, human resources, land, energy, and water. The State Plan establishes a system for the formulation and program coordination of State and County plans, policies, programs, projects, and regulatory activities. The State Plan also facilitates the integration of all major State and County activities. The proposed project is consistent with the following objectives and policies of the State Plan: HRS \u00a7226-13 Objectives and policies for the physical environment -land, air, and water quality. *** (b) To achieve the land, air, and water quality objectives, it shall be the policy of this State to: *** (7). ~i:icourage urban developments in close proximity to existing services and fac1httes. The County of Kauai General Plan (2000) recognizes the Princeville community as \"the only North Shore community that provides the full range of urban-level services, including wastewater treatment. \"2 The proposed project would be developed within close proximity to urban services of the Princeville area, including potable water and electric service, and would therefore be consistent with the policy of encouraging urban development within the meaning of HRS 226-13 (b)(7).3 6.2 HA WAIi STATE LAND USE LAW HRS Chapter 205 articulates the Hawaii State Land Use Law. This law is intended to preserve, protect, and encourage the development oflands in the State ofHawai'i for uses that are best suited to the public health and welfare of its people, and classifies all land into four districts: Urban, Conservation, Agriculture, and Rural. The Conservation district has five subzones: Protective, Limited, Resource, General and Special. These subzones define a set of identified land uses which may be allowed by a discretionary permit. The proposed project is situated in the Resource subzone of the Conservation District. 2 Section 6.1.4.3, Kauai General Plan. 3 The proposed project is outside of the Princeville Utilities and County of Kauai sewerage service area; as such, the project will use an underground, self-contained, extended aeration wastewater treatment system (this system is summarized in Exhibit 1 ). This system will comply with applicable State Department of Health requirements for individual wastewater systems 25 504629.4 Hawai'i Administrative Rules, Title 13, Department of Land and Natural Resources, Subtitle 1 Administration, Chapter 5, Conservation District, Subchapter 2, Subzones states inrelevant part: \u00a713-5-13 Resource (R) subzone. ( a) The objective of this subzone is to ensure, with proper management, the sustainable use of the natural resources of those areas. (b) The(R)subzone shall encompass: ( I) Lands necessary for providing fature parkland and lands presently used for national, state, county, or private parks; (2) Lands suitable for growing and harvesting of commercial timber or other forest products; (3) Lands suitable for outdoor recreational uses such as hunting, fishing, hiking, camping, and picnicking; (4) Offshore islands of the State of Hawai 'i, unless placed in a (P) or (L) subzone; (5) Lands and state marine waters seaward of the upper reaches of the wash of waves, usually evidenced by the edge or vegetation or by the debris left by the wash of waves on shore to the extent of the State's jurisdiction, unless placed in a (P) or (L) subzone. (c) Identified land uses in the resource (R)subzone are restricted to those listed in section 13-5- 24. \u00a713-5-24 Identified land uses in the resource subzone. ( c) Identified land uses in the resource subzone and their required permits (if applicable), are listed below: R-7 SINGLE FAMILY RESIDENCE (D-1) A singlefamily residence that conforms to design standards as outlined in this chapter. Analysis. The construction of one single-family dwelling, conforming with the applicable design standards referenced in HAR \u00a713-5-41, on the Lot is a reasonable and beneficial use of the project site, consistent with the objectives of the Conservation District and the Resource subzone, including the preservation of scenic resources. The development of a single dwelling on the Lot is consistent with the development in the surrounding neighborhood (see the detailed discussion in sections 4.4 and 4.5 of this document). The Landscape Plan improves the condition of the proposed site by preventing the spread of invasive species, as well as, promoting harborage and forage for native bird species. 504629.4 Currently, the proposed site is dominated by invasive species which are spreading throughout the site. The proposed project's Landscape Plan would remove invasive plants within the area which is currently mainly cleared, add large canopy milo and hala trees, preserve existing hala trees and maintain the mowed grass pasture areas. The maintenance of open and mowed grass areas will provide harborage and forage for native bird species, including the Kolea and Nene. These native 26 birds are currently found in the surrounding areas and are likely to utilize the Lot. If the proposed project is not undertaken, the proposed site remains degraded forest dominated by invasive grasses, shrubs and trees, which will continue to slowly spread throughout the project site, eventually filling in the mowed areas and eliminating the open fields potentially useful to Kolea and Nene. After development of the proposed site, no further dwellings are permissible in the Conservation District. Accordingly, the remaining portions of the Lot will remain open, consistent with the Conservation District's overall goal of conservation and preservation. No significant visual impacts are expected from the construction and maintenance of the proposed dwelling, whether from the abutting Kuhio Highway or from the distant Hanalei Town or Hanalei Bay. HELIOS's long-term plans for the remammg acreage in Lot includes various remedial efforts, such as preservation of specified areas for (i) hiking, (ii) planting of native foliage, and (iii) recreational space to be utilized by the homeowner, its extended family and friends. These improvements would be in furtherance of the specific objectives of HAR \u00a713-5-13(b)(l) and (b)(3). In sum, the proposed use is consistent with the overall goal of preservation. No long-term negative impacts to the physical or social environment are anticipated as a result of the proposed project. No significant change to the topography of the site will occur. No valuable natural or cultural resource would be adversely affected or lost. No native ecosystems are present. No scenic resources are significantly impacted. Any future significant alteration to the landscaping of the property, including, but not limited to, the clearing of vegetation which screens views of the structure from outside the property, will require the owner to submit a new CDUA to the BLNR if the BLNR determines this clearing could have a significant negative secondary impact on the natural or cultural resources or the surrounding community, including scenic impacts. 6.3 COUNTY OF KAUAI GENERAL PLAN The County of Kauai General Plan (the \"General Plan\") presents the County's v1s10n for Kauai and establishes strategies for achieving that vision. The strategies are expressed in terms of policies and implementing actions. Chapter 2 of the General Plan, Vision for Kauai 2020, at section 2.1 describes various community values, including the following: 27 504629.4 Protection, management, and enjoyment of our open spaces, unique natural beauty, rural lifestyle, outdoor recreation and parks. Balanced management of our built environment, clustering new development around existing communities and maintaining the four-story height limit. Chapter 6 of the General Plan, Enhancing Towns & Communities and Providing for Growth, addresses, among other things, the \"location and character of future residential and commercial growth\" (page 6-1, Chapter 6 General Plan). Section 6.1.4.2 Policies states in part: (a) The North Shore shall remain primarily a rural, agricultural area, with resort use and other urban development concentrated in Princeville. The towns of Hanalei and Kilauea shall also provide for housing and other urban uses. ( c) Princeville Mauka. The intent is to provide an urban village to consist primarily of affordable housing, with a commercial area for resident shopping and services and sites for a new elementary school and/or a middle schooL A site near the airport will provide for light industrial use. Section 6.1.4.3 Rationale for Map and Text Policies of the General Plan states in relevant part: Princeville. The Princeville re-designation continues the longstanding strategy of concentrating North Shore development at Princeville. It is the only North Shore community that provides the full range of urban-level services, including wastewater treatment. . . . . Mauka of the highway, the light industrial site will provide space for North Shore businesses and fulfill a prior condition of zoning. Princeville Corporation intends the 'Mauka Village\" to provide affordable housing to satisfy County and State housing requirements ..... Unlike the makai resort/residential community, the Mauka Village will be oriented to local residents. . . . Princeville will serve the village with its privately-operated water and wastewater treatment systems. Analysis. The proposed construction of one dwelling on this otherwise unimproved 14 acre lot will maintain and preserve the rural character of the North Shore community which the General Plan seeks to maintain. At the same time, it is consistent with the General Plan's strategy of concentrating further North Shore development at Princeville, given Princeville is the only North Shore community providing a full range of urban-level services. The proposed project's specific location places it in a largely-residential and commercial community along this portion of Kuhio Highway. Therefore, the proposed project is consistent with the community value of clustering new development around existing communities described in Chapter 2 of the General Plan, Vision for Kauai 2020. 28 504629.4 Chapter 3 of the General Plan, Caring for the Land, Water and Culture, sets policies relating to \"Heritage Resources\" including resources connected to \"the visual experience of the environment\" (section 3.1, General Plan). Section 3 .1.1 Heritage Resources Map describes ''Heritage Resource Maps\" appended to the General Plan which \"document important natural, scenic and historic features\" of the island. The Heritage Resources Map for the North Shore of Kauai identifies scenic roadway corridors along Kuhio Highway. See Exhibit 10. Section 3.2.1 Policy provides in part: (a) In developing public facilities and in administering land use regulations, the County shall seek to preserve scenic resources and public views. Public views are those from a public place, such as a park, highway or along the shoreline. (b) The County shall observe the following general principles in maintaining scenic resources: (1) Preserve public views that exhibit a high degree of intactness or vividness. \"Intactness\" refers to both the integrity of visual patterns and to the extent to which the landscape is free from structures or other visually encroaching features. \"Vividness\" relates to the memorability of a view, caused by contrasting landforms which create striking and distinctive patterns. (Examples are the silhouette of Mt. Ha'upu against the horizon, views of Nonou Mountain from the valley and the coast, and the view of Hanalei Valley from the overlook.) (2) Preserve the scenic qualities of mountains, hills and other elevated landforms, qualities such as the silhouette against the horizon and the mass and shape of the landform. (3) Structures should not impede or intrude upon public views of the feature and should not alter the character of the immediate area around the land feature. Section 3.2.2 Rationale provides in part: 504629.4 As discussed herein, the intent is to preserve public views -i.e., views seen from a park, the beach, a road or some other public place. The term does not include private views -i.e., views from one's residence or other private property. ( emphasis in original). 29 As an example, consider a hill which is an important landmark for residents in the surrounding community . . . If a person purchased the land and built a house high up on that hill, he would have a dominating view. But the owner's private view would be achieved at the expense of many other residents' and visitors' enjoyment and appreciation of the landscape. Of course, the owner should be able to build a house on property he purchased for that purpose. But he should not be allowed to site his house so that it interferes with an important local landmark. Instead, the County should provide clearly-stated land use regulations that require a formal view analysis and placement of structures in locations that do not have a significant impact on public views. Analysis. The proposed project sits within the roadway view corridor of the Kuhio Highway identified in the Heritage Resources Map and but is not visible from Kuhio Highway and does not impact the views from Kuhio Highway because the Lot is located above Kuhio Highway and not below it. As discussed in sections 4.4, 4.5 and 4.6, the project does not substantially impede or intrude upon public views of the valley rim and does not impact the views of the Hanalei Valley from the rim. Finally, if the proposed project impacted the views of residential homeowners across Kuhio Highway (which it does not), such impacts would be to private views as defined under the General Plan and therefore not be within the scope of chapter 3 of the General Plan. 6.4 NORTH SHORE DEVELOPMENT PLAN UPDATE (1980) The North Shore Development Plan Update (1980) (the \"North Shore Plan\") identifies land suitable for residential expansion as those lands which are not included in tsunami inundation and flood hazard areas; are not considered prime or productive ag lands; do not adversely affect coastal or ground water quality; do not affect important wildlife habitats; do not adversely affect scenic, historic, or recreational resources; and are serviceable by existing utilities and public services (Section LC., Summary of Findings and Recommendations -Growth, North Shore Plan, page 4). The North Shore Plan's \"Recommendations\" (pages 43-44), state in relevant part, that: 1. Scenic views should not be adversely affected by man-made improvements. 2. Scenic views from Kuhio Highway should be protected and enhanced. (Section IV. C. l. Scenic/Historic, North Shore Plan, page 44) Section IV. C.l. Scenic/Historic (page 43) refers to a map of \"Historic, Scenic & Recreational Resources\" appended to the North Shore Plan. The map identifies numerous scenic view planes most of which are along Kuhio Highway and almost all of which are makai-facing. Those view planes which do face mauka are distant from the proposed site. 30 504629.4 Section IV (page 43) also references an additional list of historic and scenic features contained in the North Shore Special Planning Area Report, 1972. This report's list of outstanding scenic features includes the \"magnificent mountains in the background of the Hanalei Valley.\" Various other narrative sections of the North Shore Plan affirm that scenic views should not be adversely affected by man-made improvements, that scenic views from Kuhio Highway should be protected and enhanced, and state that residences should be constructed away from Kuhio Highway, and landscaped to minimize their visual impact. Analysis. The proposed project will not impact any view planes specifically identified in the North Shore Plan including views from the Kuhio Highway corridor, views identified in the \"Historic, Scenic & Recreational Resources\" map (appended to the North Shore Plan) and views identified in the North Shore Special Planning Area Report, 1972. Additionally, as discussed in sections 4.4, 4.5 and 4.6 of this document, the proposed project will have no significant adverse impact on views of the Hanalei Valley rim. 6.5 KAUA'I COUNTY CODE, COMPREHENSIVE ZONING ORDINANCE The purpose of the County's Comprehensive Zoning Ordinance (\"CZO\") is to regulate and provide standards for land development and the construction of buildings and other structures in the County of Kaua' i. The regulations and standards prescribed in the CZO are intended to regulate development to ensure its compatibility with the overall character of the island. As the proposed project is located within the State's Conservation District: Resource Subzone, the State, not the County, has jurisdiction and authority over approval of permits for residential uses within the district; therefore, the CZO does not address development of the proposed project. SECTION 7 PERMITS AND APPROVALS The following permits are required to develop a single-family dwelling on the Lot: 504629.4 Conservation District Use Permit (\"CDUP\") from the State DLNR Office of Conservation and Coastal Lands; Building Permit from the County of Kauai (\"County\"); Grubbing permit from the County for clearing the footprint area of the home; Driveway Approach Permit from the County for a driveway connection with Kuhio Highway; County Department of Public Works (\"DPW\") permit to bring electric conduit from KIUC line across Kuhio Highway; and County permit for any work requiring traffic management on Kuhio Highway during construction of the proposed dwelling (none expected to be required). 31 SECTION 8 COMMENTS AND COORDINATION Community meetings and consultation concerning the proposed project began in 2016 and will continue through the Environmental Assessment, Conservation District Use Permit and construction periods. Updates will be provided to neighbors and others, as requested. HELIOS and its representatives discussed proposals for uses of Lot, including the single\u00ad family residence, with numerous individuals and groups island-wide in connection with the consultation process associated with the AIS, including with the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service, the Hanalei Community Association President and a Board Member who were given a presentation, the State of Hawaii Department of Land and Natural Resources (\"DLNR\"), and the State of Hawaii Historic Preservation Division. 8.1 PRE-ASSESSMENT AND AGENCY CONSULTATION A Pre-Assessment Letter was mailed on September 20, 2017 to a total of 13 interested parties, including government agencies, utilities, neighboring landowners and neighboring business such as: DLNR, Office of Conservation & Coastal Lands State of Hawaii Department of Transportation, Kauai District County of Kauai, Planning Department U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service The Hanalei-Ha'ena Community Association The Princeville Community Association Neighboring property owners Comments and responses were requested with a October 20, 2017 deadline. The Pre\u00ad Assessment Letter is included in Exhibit 11 to this EA. All responses will be incorporated following the conclusion of the 30-day comment period. SECTION 9 FINDINGS AND IMPACTS The availability of the draft EA will be announced in the State of Hawaii Office of Environmental Quality Control bi-monthly Environmental Notice publication during the mandatory 30-day public review period. In accordance with the provisions of HRS Chapter 343, the draft EA has concluded that the proposed project will not have significant adverse impacts on the environmental quality of the area. As such, it is respectfully suggested that a FONSI be issued for the proposed project. Therefore, an EIS is not required. A review of the 13 \"Significance Criteria\" used as a basis for the above determination is presented below. Involves an irrevocable commitment to loss or destruction of any natural or cultural resources. The proposed project will not use or destroy any natural resources on the proposed site; in fact, natural resources will be enhanced by the removal and control of 32 504629.4 invasive species and the preservation of ha/a trees and maintenance of mowed grass areas which provide forage for native birds. With regard to cultural resources, the AIS identified no historic properties on the proposed site; further, the proposed site is located well outside the buffer zone planned for the pre-contact historic property located on the Lot. Accordingly, the proposed project would not involve an irrevocable commitment to loss or the destruction of any natural or cultural resources. Curtails the range of beneficial uses of the environment. The proposed project will not curtail the range of beneficial uses of the environment. The project site is currently overgrown dense vegetation populated with invasive plant species. The dwelling represents 0.8% of the 14.109 acres of Conservation District land included in Lot, which (other than the project site) will remain undeveloped open space. Moreover, the proposed construction of one single-family home is a reasonable and beneficial use of the site, and the proposed control of invasive plant species will serve to actually enhance and protect the environment. Further, no long-term negative environmental impacts are anticipated as a result of the proposed project. Conflicts with the State's long-term environmental policies or goals and guidelines as expressed in HRS Chapter 343; and any revisions thereof and amendments thereto, court decisions, or executive orders. The proposed project does not conflict with the State's long-term environmental policies, goals, and guidelines. In fact, the selected removal of invasive species and maintenance of areas attractive to certain native bird species will enhance, conserve, and protect the natural resources of the Conservation District. The proposed project will not result in any adverse effects to the public health, safety and welfare. Substantially affects the community. The proposed project will not substantially impact the community, and will not negatively affect the economic or social welfare of the community. As set forth in sections 3, 4 and 5 of this document, the project will result in no significant negative impact on infrastructure, flora, fauna, cultural or historic properties, or visual or aesthetic resources. The project would, however, generate short-term employment and long-term real property tax revenues. Substantially affects public health. The proposed project will have no negative impact on public health. Involves substantial secondary impacts, such as population changes or effects on public facilities. The proposed project will not cause substantial secondary impacts. The development of a single-family residence in an area already characterized by similar residential development will not create additional pressures of a substantial nature. Population changes and effects on public facilities (such as roads, park use, potable water usage, electricity usage, etc.) will be minimal. Involves a substantial degradation of environmental quality. The proposed project will not result in a substantial degradation of environmental quality; in fact, the removal and control of invasive species will actually improve and enhance environmental quality. Further, as discussed in sections 3, 4 and 5 of this document, the proposed project will have no significant negative 33 504629.4 impact on the physical or social environment. All construction activities will be implemented using best management practices (\"BMPs\"). Is individually limited, but cumulatively has considerable effect on the environment, or involves a commitment for larger actions. Cumulatively, the proposed project will have no considerable negative effect on the environment, nor will the project create a commitment for larger actions. Regarding environmental effects, inasmuch as the project proposes to control invasive species and enhance potential forage and harborage habitat for native birds, the project will actually have a positive effect on the environment. Regarding a commitment for additional or larger actions, the project creates no such commitment inasmuch as the proposed action is a stand-alone proposal for the construction of one single-family residence; other than the proposed dwelling, no further residential development would be permitted in the Lot. Substantially affects a rare, threatened, or endangered species or its habitat. The proposed project will not substantially affect any rare, threatened, or endangered species, or its habitat. As discussed in sections 3.3 and 3.4 of this document, no known endangered species or their habitat exists at the project site. Measures to mitigate any potential harm to any native Hawaiian species will be employed during construction of the project. Further, the removal of invasive species and maintenance of mowed grassy areas should create additional forage and harborage for native birds, some of which are threatened. Detrimentally affects air or water quality or ambient noise levels. No long-term negative impacts to air and water quality or ambient noise levels will result from the proposed project. A temporary increase in ambient noise levels could occur during construction of the dwelling. Nevertheless, best management practices (BMPs) will be employed where possible to mitigate any such impacts, as well as any short-term impacts on air quality from dust or similar construction effects. Refer to sections 3.2 and 3.5 of this document for a further discussion of the proposed project's impact on, respectively, water and air quality/noise. Affects or is likely to suffer damage by being located in an environmentally sensitive area, such as a flood plain, tsunami zone, beach, erosion-prone area, geologically hazardous land, estuary, freshwater, or coastal waters. The proposed project would not affect environmentally sensitive areas, such as a floodplain, tsunami zone, beach, erosion-prone area, geologically hazardous land, estuary, freshwater, or coastal waters, as the project site is not situated in any of these areas. Substantially affects scenic vistas and view planes identified in County or State plans or studies. The proposed project would not substantially affect scenic vistas and view planes identified in County or State plans or studies. Any future significant alteration to the landscaping of the property, including, but not limited to, the clearing of vegetation which screens views of the structure from outside the property, will require the owner to submit a new CDUA to the BLNR if the BLNR determines this clearing could have a significant negative secondary impact on the natural or cultural resources or the surrounding community, including scenic impacts. 34 504629.4 The \"Historic, Scenic & Recreational Resources\" map appended to the North Shore Development Plan Update (1980) (\"North Shore Development Plan\") identifies numerous scenic view planes, many of which are along Kuhio Highway. The proposed dwelling will not impact view planes identified in the ''Historic, Scenic & Recreational Resources\" map of the North Shore Development Plan given that almost all such planes are makai-facing; any planes that face mauka are distant from the proposed project. The North Shore Planning District Heritage Resources Map (\"Heritage Resources Map\") appended to the Kauai General Plan (2000) (\"General Plan\") also identifies scenic roadway corridors along Kuhio Highway. The proposed project will be virtually invisible from the roadway view corridor identified in the Heritage Resources Map. Both documerits express a concern for preserving scenic resources generally; as discussed in section 4.6 of this document, the proposed dwelling would not be visible from Hanalei Town and, to the extent the dwelling's roof might be visible from certain areas on the Hanalei Valley floor, the choice of building materials and surrounding large canopy tree plantings would result in the dwelling largely blending into its surrounding environment. A detailed discussion of the visual impacts of the proposed project, along with corresponding mitigation measures, is discussed in sections 4.4, 4.5 and 4.6 of this document. Requires substantial energy consumption. The proposed single-family residence will not consume significant amounts of energy. SECTION 10 PRELIMINARY ENVIRONMENTAL ASSESSMENT A Preliminary Environmental Assessment was circulated with a Pre-Assessment Letter on September 20, 2017 to the parties listed in the Pre-Assessment Mailing List attached hereto as Exhibit 11. Following the letter, additional maps were provided by letter date September 25, 2017. The complete set of exhibits to this Draft Environmental Assessment were not provided with the Preliminary Environmental Assessment and Pre-Assessment Letter. The following written comments were received: letter dated September 29, 2017 from the County of Kauai Planning Department, letter dated October 20, 2017 from Hanalei to Ha'ena Community Association, letter dated October 25, 2017 from the State of Hawaii Department of Land and Natural Resources. See Exhibit 12. This Draft Environmental Assessment addresses all comments received, including clarifications regarding the scenic impact of the single-family residence on views of the area, the use of the single-family residence by the owners, extended family and friends, and the proposed alterations to the landscaping. 35 504629.4 I ~ 1 1 ~ \" / V CESIGN CONCePTS 2 ..... l<El<El<E IIT D180 WWWDCIUI.UAI COM GEARON RESIDENCE < / / / / \" \" \" \" .,.\u00b7\u00b7 \" / / \" > \" > / p' ~- I 'I i ~l i ', . g~ [' I ~ ~1 ~ / / ' / ' / V / / / / / / CESIGN CONCE~TS 28<1 l<Et<El<E i !1 i ~ti I' / )> ! ~ N N ~ I I ,,.,,.-- / I I I / \u00b7,. ,, ..,, ' ts. i:j 80811211 D100 WWWOCKAUAI COM GEARON RESIDENCE ~ / / / / / ' ' ' ' ' i:j '\u00b7\"\"\u00b7 ~\" i -7!M.

Stringent testing by the University of Hawaii Water Resources Research Center (WRRC) shows that WaiponoPure products treat domestic wastewater to a quality that is 300% better than national standards. The WaiponoPure system utilize s the same proven treatment proces ses typical of municipal treatment plants, but which are compact, self -contained units ideally suited f or homes and small business off the sewer network . The WaiponoPure system is an extended aeration wastewater treatment system with a two-stage biological process to optimize denitrification. The ability of the WaiponoPure system to provide clean effluent enables the reuse of precious water for irrigation purposes, helping to conserve resources. Through development of superior wastewater treatment products and absolute dedication to customer satisfaction, WaiponoPure envisions a Hawaii landscape free of pollution from cesspools and failed septic systems. We aim to promote and enable r esponsible stewardship of Hawaii's environment. Process The WaiponoPure treatment system c onverts wastewater from the home into a clear, odorless liquid using both suboxic and aerobic compartments to maximize biological treatment e ffectiveness . The effluent enters the system through a pretreatment c hamber where larger solids settle temporarily until they are broken up over time. The wastewater flows into a suboxic compartment that has low oxygen levels t o promote denitrification. Liquid from the suboxic compartm ent then flows into a series of aerobic compartments in which several diffusers pump fine bubbles into the effluent . The rising air bubbles deliver oxygen to enable aerobic organisms to thrive and ultimately decompose waste. Turbulence caused by the rising air bubbles also creates a mixing pattern which keeps the waste sludge in suspension (\"mixed liquor\"), helping eliminate the build -up of sludge . The superior treatm ent process of the WaiponoPure system , including constant recirculation of the mixed liquor, reduces the need for sludge removal , a key benefit that reduces operating costs. WaiponoPure System PRODUCT OVERVIEW | WaiponoPure Advanced Wastewater Treatment System By Thetis Pacific LLC 94-515 808.369.7116 Most of the nutrient digestion takes place in the aerobic chambers of the WaiponoPure system utilizing a combination of an attached and suspended growth process. The attached film grows on biomedia and the suspended growth is created by mixing and recircul ation of sludge. This combination results in a treatment efficiency that exceeds the individual per formance of an attached or suspended growth process. The treated wastewater flows from the a eration compartments into a clarifier that has a cone shaped b ottom. The clarifier allows the water to settle so that any suspended solids in the mixed liquor can settle and be pumped back to the suboxic compartment for further biological treatment. The remaining clear water from the clarifier is pumped from a final clean water compartment to a n irrigation and/or disposal system. System Features Extended Aeration - Multiple aero bic compartments with diffusers promote biological decomposition of waste sludge. Longer mixing time and recirculation with aged sludge offer s a stable biological ecosystem better adapted for effectively treating waste load fluctuations while also accommodating variable occupancy loads. Biological filter media - Biomedia provides a complex structured surface area where beneficial bacterial colonies can grow , forming biofilm . The biomedia a llow s water to pass over the colonies , helping to filter the wastewater and bring nutrients and oxygen that are required for treatment . The retention time and biomass are increased to ensure superior treatm ent performance . Suboxic Treatment - The process of removing nitrogen from wastewater, or denitrification, requ ires contact time in a low oxygen, or suboxic, environment. WaiponoPure's suboxic compartment s achieve denitrification and sets our system apart from other ATU's that do not provide suboxic treatment. Advantages Advanced Treatment - WaiponoPure uses proven , advanced biological treatment processes typical of municipal secondary treatmen t facilities . Compact Design - Waipono Pure packages advanced wastewater treatment processes into one compact, self -contained unit with no extra septic tanks or complicated plumbing . Quick Installation - Our system is fast to install and suitable for both new construction and renovations. Environmentally Friendly - WaiponoPure mitigates the impact of wastewater effluent on the environment by treating wastewater before it is released to the ground. Engineering - WaiponoPure's team of engineers will custom design each system in coop eration with the property owner, architect, or contractor. Project Management - our staff has over six decades of project management experience and will guide each project to ensure successful completion.

INTRODUCTION Purpose A geotechnical investigation has been conducted for the Gearon residence to be constructed in Princeville, Kaua'i. The subject property is located on Khi Highway opposite its iners ection with Hanalei Plantation Road . The purposes of this study have been to gather information on the nature, distribution and characteristics of the subsurface earth materials and ground water conditions at the site, and to prepare specific recommendations for use in project design and construction. Scope The scope of this investigation is described in our proposal of December 16, 201 6. On April 24 and 25, 2017, our field representative conducted a reconnaissance of the property and mapped the locations of five test borings that were drilled and sampl ed to a maximum depth of about 14.5 feet. Our field engineer logged, classified and recovered relatively undisturbed samples of the earth materials drawn from selected vertical intervals in each boring. Ground water level observations in each boring were recorded during exploration and at intervals following completion. The samples were transported to our office for laboratory testing and further classification. The laboratory testing program comprised determinations of natural moisture content, dry un it weight, plasticity, direct shear, unconfined compressive strength and compressibility properties . This report contains our findings regarding site soil, ground water and other geologic conditions; conclusions pertaining to expansive soils, settlement, bearing capacity and foundation conditions; and, recommendations for site preparation and grading, foundations, floor support, swimming pool design, drainage and erosion control. In Appendix A, the location of the project site is shown in relationship to surrounding landmarks and cultural features on Plate No. A1, Vicinity Map. The approximate locations of the test borings are depicted in relationship to the proposed residence , existing ground surface elevation contours and the property lines on Plate No. A2, Site Plan. Geotechnical descriptions and related data recorded during the field exploration phase of our study are displayed on Plates No. A3 through A 7, Logs of Borings. A key to the soil symbols and identification criteria used on the logs is pres ented on Plate No. A 8, Unified Soil Classification System. The results of the natural moisture content and dry unit weight tests are posted on the Logs of Borings, on which are also indicated the types of other laboratory tests conducted on corresponding samples. The remaining laboratory test data are contained in Appendix B. The results of the plasticity tests are shown on Plate No. B1, Atterberg Limits Test Data. Summaries of the strength tests appear on Plates No. B2 and B3, Direct Shear Test Data , and on Plates No. B 4 through B 7, Unconfined Compressive Strength Test Data . References consulted during the course of our investigation are listed in Appendix C. Page 2 Project No. 16273.01G May 22, 2017 Gearon Residence Khi Highway at Hanalei Plantation Road, Princeville, Kaua'i, Hawai'i Project Description According to preliminary architectural plans ( Clan Architecture, LLC, 2017 ), the new residence will consist of a series of contiguous, one -storey , Balinese -style modules which together will form an aerial \"V\" shape. Pairs of wings adjoining the central daytime living quarters will be composed of three offset but conjoined nighttime living modules, each about 22 feet square in plan view. The east wing will house a guest bedroom with a connecting full bathroom; two additional guest bedrooms with a single, common full bathroom; and a master bedroom suite. The north wing will include an office, a powder room, a guest bedroom with a connecting full bathroom, and a second master bedroom suite. The central daytime living area modules will cover the laundry, kitchen and pantry, dining and living rooms. Offse t, stone masonry privacy walls equipped with outdoor showers will extend along the front sides of each wing module. Additional improvements will includes a new gravel driveway, an aerobic effluent treatment system, and a swimming pool with an incorporated hydrotherapy spa, The individual, overheight modular roof systems will consist of conically arranged wood fan rafters supporting wood sheathing, felt underlayments and sawn wood shake clad ding. FINDINGS Site Description As shown on Plates No. A1 and A 2, the subject property is an irregularly -shaped parcel encompassing approximately 14.109 acres of gently sloping terrain bordered by Khi Highway (State of Hawai' i, 1996) . The lot boundaries are marked by gated wire fencing. Access to the proposed cons truction area is afforded by a graveled drive. The property margins are marked by stands of indigenous trees and the interior, although mostly cleared, contains a dozen others. Ground within the proposed home site falls from approximate elevation 471 feet mauka to about elevation 460 feet makai, resulting in an overall a maximum gradient approaching seven percent. Geologic Setting The subject property is located on an ancient wave -cut terrace underlain by lava flows associated with Mount Nmhana, an ex tinct, secondary volcanic vent structurally connected to Mount Wai 'ale'ale, the principal volcano that created the island of Kaua'i (Macdonald, 1960). The volcanic rocks have been altered by chemical processes to form thick zones of saprolite. Page 3 Project No. 16273.01G May 22, 2017 Gearon Residence Khi Highway at Hanalei Plantation Road, Princeville, Kaua'i, Hawai'i The soil mantle overlying the saprolite formation is composed of a silty clay or silt assigned to the Makapili series. Th is soil is characterized by a low shrink/swell potential but high corrosion potential s with respect to uncoated steel and concrete. Th e erosion hazard is considered slight to moderate on slopes of the inclination typical of the site (Foote, et al. , 1972). Earth Materials The borings encountered a reddish -orange, very moist loose to semicompact silt (Unified Soil Classification: M L) to a n average depth of about six feet. Th is soil is identified as a part of the Makapili series, described above. Below the surficial soil horizon, brick red, very moist, soft to very soft, clayey silt (MH) was discovered to the maximum depth explored, appro ximately 14.5 feet, except in the two lowermost borings. At those points, soft clayey silt was penetrated to an average depth of 12.5 feet, below which dusky orange -brown, very moist, medium -stiff saprolite was penetrated to the maximum depth explored, ab out 14.5 feet. Laboratory test results revealed that the soil moisture contents steadily increase and the associated dry unit weights gradually decrease with greater depth. Further subsurface details are depicted on Plates No. A3 through A 8. Ground Wat er Each test boring was checked for the presence of ground water during exploration and at intervals following completion. No free ground water was observed at any location. CONCLUSIONS Expansive Soils The results of Atterberg limits tests, appearing on Plate No. B1, indicate that the surficial soil has negligible plasticity characteristics ( average plasticity index = 3 percent) and low water retention properties ( average liquid limit = 45 percent). The plasticity index is the maximum range of water contents which a soil can assume under natural conditions. It represents the difference between the liquid limit, or the maximum amount of water that a soil is capable of absorbing without bec oming fluid, and the plastic limit, or the minimum amount of water a soil can hold without crumbling. The Atterberg limits test data confirm that the surficial soil is virtually non expansive. Page 4 Project No. 16273.01G May 22, 2017 Gearon Residence Khi Highway at Hanalei Plantation Road, Princeville, Kaua'i, Hawai'i Bearing Capacity Direct shear strength tests conducted o n selected samples of the surficial soils yielded an average internal friction angle approaching 27 and an average cohesion value on the order of 290 pounds per square foot, as shown on Plates No. B 2 and B3. The internal friction angle is a measure of so il grittiness, while the cohesion component is a measure of soil stickiness. Unconfined compressive strength tests performed on selected samples of the surficial soil reached an average ultimate undrained shear strength near 2,780 pounds per square foot, a s illustrated on Plate No. B4 . These results confirm that the surficial soils can support structural loads of moderate intensity. By contrast, similar tests completed on selected samples of the immediately underlying soils attained a markedly lower average ultimate strength of just 750 pounds per square foot , as illustrated on Plates No. B5 and B6. The degree to which superposed foundations can be safely loaded is in part governed by the limited bearing capability and settlement sensitivity of these weaker soils. Unconfined compression tests performed on selected samples of saprolite beneath the zone of compressible soils reached an average undrained shear strength on the order of 2,800 pounds per square foot, as portrayed on Plate No. B7. These results indicate that the saprolite formation can sustain structural loads of at least intermediate intensity. Settlement Laboratory test data indicate that the modulus of vertical subgrade reaction, which is fixed for a particular range of loading conditions, is on the order of 142 pounds per cubic inch for the surficial soils . This implies that these soils can be expected to compress one inch under a uniform load of about 10 tons per square foot. The calculated modulus for the underlying soft, clayey silt deposit is approximately 56 pounds per cubic inch, so it could be expected to settle one inch under a uniform load of about 4 tons per square foot. The results of the consolidation tests, shown on Plate No. B 8 demonstrates that the clayey silt deposit is appreciably compressible. The calculated preconsolidation pressure is about 520 pounds per square foot at a depth of 10 feet. The preconsolidation pressure is the load under which these soils have been subjected in the past. The coefficient of c onsolidation, which represents the ratio between applied load and expected amount of compression, was measured at about 7.5 percent at a depth of 10 feet. The calculations show that predicted future settlements due to the influence of the anticipated overl ying structural loading increases will be negligible. Rate of consolidation analyses indicate that 9 5 percent compression of these soils has already occurred under the weight of the soil overburden. If the new foundations and floor slabs are designed in accordance with the recommendations of this report, we expect a maximum total foundation settlement of less than 0.50 inch, a maximum differential settlement of less than 0.25 inch between any two adjacent foundations, and floor slab settlements well below 0.15 inch. Page 5 Project No. 16273.01G May 22, 2017 Gearon Residence Khi Highway at Hanalei Plantation Road, Princeville, Kaua'i, Hawai'i Foundation Conditions Our study indicates that the new home and exterior privacy walls can be supported upon conventional continuous and isolated reinforced concrete foundations based in and underlain by undisturbed native soils. Our investi gation also indicates that the concrete slab -on-grade living area floors and exterior concrete slabs can be supported upon recompacted soils, new engineered fill , or a combination thereof. RECOMMENDATIONS Site Preparation and Grading Clearing and Gru bbing - All surface vegetation and unwanted trees along with roots half an inch in diameter should be removed from the construction areas, together with any rubbish or rubble. Excavations and depressions resulting from clearing and grubbing operations sho uld be dug out to firm soil and backfilled with suitable materials in accordance with the following recommendations. Subgrade Preparation - Where fill is to be constructed, exposed soils should be scarified to a depth of six inches, brought to at least the optimum moisture content, and compacted to not less than 90 percent relative density in accordance with ASTM Designation D 1557 -12. Els ewhere, including cut areas, all exposed soi l surfaces beneath the building, driveway and other pavement areas should be brought to at least the optimum moisture content and compacted not less than 90 percent relative compaction in accordance with the abov e standard. Inability to achieve the stipulated minimum level of compaction should be used as a field criterion to identify areas of loose or disturbed soils that should be overexcavated and replaced with engineered fill, processed, placed and compacted as described below; or, stabilized in accordance with the recommendations of the project geotechnical engineer. Fill Material - Prior to use, all intended fill material should be approved by the project geotechnical engineer. On -site soil may be reused as incidental engineered fill provided that it is processed to remove vegetation and other perishable substances along with any rubbish and stones or irreducible hard lumps exceeding two inches in largest dimension. All other structural fill should consist of i mported soil which should be clean material conforming to the foregoing criteria. In addition, imported soil should h ave a plasticity index not exceeding 20 when tested in accordance with ASTM Designation D 4318 -10 and at least 20 percent of the particles should pass the No . 100 sieve when tested in accordance with ASTM Designation D 422 -07. Fill Placement and Compactio n - All fill and backfill material should be placed in horizontal lifts not exceeding eight inches in loose thickness. Each lift should be brought to at least the optimum moisture content and compacted to not less than 90 percent relative compaction, per ASTM Designation D 1557 - 12. Page 6 Project No. 16273.01G May 22, 2017 Gearon Residence Khi Highway at Hanalei Plantation Road, Princeville, Kaua'i, Hawai'i All earthwork operations should be observed and the soils tested by the project geotechnical engineer or his representative. The further recommendations of this report are contingent upon adherence to this and the previous recommendations. Foundations The new home and exterior privacy walls should be supported upon conventional , continuous and isolated , reinforced concrete foo tings based in undisturbed soil. All foundations should be at least 16 inches wide and should be based at a minimum depth of 18 inches in undisturbed soil . Foundations so established should be designed for maximum net allowable bearing values of 2,100 pounds per square foot for working load or 2,800 pounds per square foot for total load, including th e effect of seismic or wind forces. Foundation concrete should be placed neat, without forming, against trimmed earth. A total of 3 0 percent of the weight of foundation concrete extending below lower adjacent finished grade should be added to the net loads at that level to account for the difference in weight between soil and structural concrete. Foundation resistance to horizontal displacement will be provided by passive earth pressures and sliding friction. Passive earth resistance should be assumed to act as an equivalent fluid weighing 2 75 pounds per cubic foot exerted against any appropriate vertical foundation face; however, the uppermost six inches of foundation embedment should be disregarded unless protected by an adjoining pavement or concrete slab. Frictional resistance should be computed as 0. 34 times the applied working load exerted against any appropriate horizontal foun dation face. These values carry a safety factor of 1.5. If resistive components derived from passive pressures and sliding friction are combined, the larger should be reduced by half. Resistance to foundation uplift will be provided by the weight of fou ndation concrete; soil resistance developed along shear planes extending from the outer foundation edges and upward at 70 from the horizontal; and, the weight of soil overlying the pullout envelope enclosed by the foundation edges, shear planes and finish ed grade. The weight of foundation concrete should be assumed at 1 00 pounds per cubic foot. T he weight of soil within the pullout envelope should be assumed at 65 pounds per cubic foot and the resistance acting along the shear planes defining the pullout envelope should be assumed at 150 pounds per square foot. These values also carry a safety factor of 1.5 Site Class E per Table 1613.5.2 of the International Building Code (2006) should govern earthquake design considerations. The soil profile associat ed with Site Class E is \"soft clay soil .\" Page 7 Project No. 16273.01G May 22, 2017 Gearon Residence Khi Highway at Hanalei Plantation Road, Princeville, Kaua'i, Hawai'i Concrete Slabs Living area, outdoor shower and patio concrete slab -on-grade floors should be at least 4.5 inches thick. Each floor slab should be underlain by a capillary break consisting of a blanket of crushed rock at least four inches thick. This material should be \"3B fine\" drain rock, conforming to ASTM C33 -90, No.67 gradation. If enhanced protection a gainst termite invasion is desired, a four- inch thick blanket of basaltic termite barrier sand could be installed instead of the capillary break. In either case, an impervious membrane at least six mils thick should be installed above the capillary break zone. A course of damp, clean sand about two inches thick over the membrane is suggested to assist in protecting the membrane from punctures during construction as well as to enhance curing of the overlying slab concrete. In addition, the floor slabs sho uld be reinforced with minimum No. 4 deformed steel bars set on maximum 18-inch centers in each direction. All reinforcing should be positioned at slab middepth. If the effects of therma l expansion are of concern, exterior slabs should be provided with co nstruction joints consisting of ruled notches spaced no farther apart than eight feet on centers in each direction. Swimming Pool The pool shell should be designed to resist at -rest lateral earth pressures equivalent to tho se exerted by a fluid weighing 45 pounds per cubic foot. Additionally, the pool should be provided with a hydrostatic relief valve to prevent heaving of the pool shell that may be caused by local seepage from rooftop landscape irrigation or other sources. The concrete pool deck should be at least 4.5 inches thick. The decking should be underlain by a six -inch thick layer of conforming to ASTM C33 -90, No.67 gradation. The pool deck should be reinforced with minimum No. 4 bars placed on 18 -inch centers in each direc tion. All reinforcing should be positioned at slab middepth. In addition, it is recommended that the reinforced deck slabs be cantilevered over the pool bond beam in lieu of standard coping. A watertight seal should be installed between the concrete deck slab and the bond beam. Drainage and Erosion Control Discharge from the building roof systems as well as runoff from the pavement and exterior flatwork areas should be directed away from the building lines. The new roof systems should be provided wit h flashing and downspouts to collect and divert runoff through a closed piping system and away from the foundations. All drainage systems should be maintained on a routine basis. Runoff onto areas where soils remain exposed should be dispersed to avoid p oints of concentrated flow and subsequent erosion.

APPENDIX A Field Exploration APPENDIX A Field Exploration On April 24 and 25, 2017 , our field representative conducted a reconnaissance of the site and surrounding vicinity. The location of the project is shown in relationship to surrounding landmarks and cultural features on Plate No. A1, Vicinity Map. Our geotechnical exploration program was conducted under the s upervision of our field representative , who logged, classified, and recovered relatively undisturbed samples of the earth materials drawn from selected vertical intervals in each of five test borings. The approximate locations of the test borings are depicted in relationship to the proposed residence , existing ground surface elevation contours and the property lines on Plate No. A2, Site Plan. The borings were advanced to a maximum depth of approximately 14.5 feet below existing ground surface. The borings were drilled and sampled with a Dando Terrier drill rig equipped with four -inch - diameter, solid -stem helical flight augers. At selected vertical intervals in each boring, relatively undisturbed samples of the earth materials were obtained by means of a 3 .0-inch-O.D. (2 .5-inch -I.D.) split -spoon sampler containing stacks of thin -walled, brass rings, each one inch long. The sampler was advanced by hammer blows produced by a 140 -pound hammer freely falling 30 inches, in accordance with ASTM Designation D 1586- 11. The number of blows required to drive the sampler a total distance of 18 inches was recorded, and the sum of the hammer blows for the second and third 6 -inch increments, or blow count, was recorded for each drive. The blow counts recorded for the split -spoon sampler are approximately twice those of the corresponding \"Standard Penetration\" blow counts . All of the samples were sealed in moisture- proof containers and transported in shock -resistant cases to our laboratory for further classification and testing. The samples were sealed in moisture -proof containers and transported in shock -resistant cases to our laboratory for further classification and testing. The earth materials were classified by color, texture, consistency, tactile moisture, and other relevant characteristics. The field classifications were recorded on the field logs, which were edited for final presentation. Ground water level observations were made during drilling and upon completion of the borin gs, which were backfilled with tamped soil following exploration.

(PGE) has performed a Phase I Environmental Site Assessment (ESA) of the subject property, referenced above, here after referred to as subject property or site. The purpose of this assessment was to evaluate potential environmental issues on the subject property as part of due diligence in preparation for development of the property. The accompanying report summarizes our findings and relates our opinions with respect to the property and potential sources of contamination at the property. Our findings and opinions are based on information that we obtained on given dates through records review, site reconnaissance, interviews, and related activities. It is possible that other information exists or subsequently has become known, just as it is possible for conditions we observed to have changed after our observation. It has been a pleasure conducting this environmental assessment for you. If you have questions regarding this report please contact me at (808) 639- 2817. Respectfully submitted, Pacific Greene Environmental, Inc. Howard Greene Environmental Project Manager Phase I ESA Gearon Hanalei Property Princeville, Kaua'i, Hawai'i Executive Summary July 2017 Executive Summary Pacific Greene Environmental Inc. (PGE) was retained by Michael Gearon of Helios Hanalei LLC, owner of the subject property , to conduct a Phase I Environmental Site Assessment in conformance with ASTM International (ASTM) Practice E 1527 -13, Standard Practice for Environmental Site Assessments. The subject property is located in north Kaua`i , near Princeville , Hawai`i 96722. It is designated as Tax Map Key: (4) 5-4-004:032. The property has a combined area of 14.109 acres of land. The property has a gently sloped bluff that is the planned site of a residence. The bluff and drive way entry area are mostly cleared and well maintained. Remainder of property is steeply sloped and forested. Slope stabilization improvements cover about a 3 acre portion of the central part of the property to protect the highway below. There are no structural improvements. The property has no known previously developed or agricultural uses. Surrounding l and use includes commercial, residential, and conservation. Surrounding most of the proper ty is Khi Highway 56. Th e property lies within the State Conservation District. The purpose of this Phase I ESA was to identify recognized environmental conditions (REC). ASTM guidance defines a REC as the presence or likely presence of any hazardous substances or petroleum products, in, on, or at the property: (1) due to any release to the environment; (2) under conditions indicative of a release to the environment; or (3) under conditions that pose a material threat of a future release to the environment. PGE conducted a site reconnaissance on May 22, 2017. A rock wall and gate secured access to the bluff of the site . The bluff was generally cleared, free of trash/debris and closely mowed. The slopes are steep and forested. On the steep slopes along Khi Highway , there are slope stabilization anchors, cables and steel netting protecting the highway below. Otherwise the property was not in any particular use. Surrounding properties are in various commercial, residential and agricultural uses. A Kaua`i Island Utility Substation and transmission lines are located near the east side of the property, on the U.S Fish and Wildlife property . No indications of RECs were noted during the site inspection of the subject property. There are three registered underground storage tank(UST) site s listed in the State of Hawai`i list of registered USTs located within a quarter of a mile radius. These are Princeville Chevron, County of Kaua`i Police/Fire Station and Hawai`i an . The USTs at Princ eville Chevron and Hawai`ian Tel are in use. These site's tanks are in good regulatory standing. There are two leaking underground storage tank (LUST) sites within one- half mile of the property. One is the current Princeville Chevron site. The second is County of Kaua`i Police/Fire Station . The leaking tanks have been removed and cleanup is complete. No further action is being required by the Hawai`i Department of Health. Both sites are slightly up gradient of the subject site however no impacts are expected to the subject property . It is not likely that any of these LUST sites would have negatively impacted the subject property due to their status, distance from, and/or location relative to the subject property. This assessment has revealed no evidence of RECs associated with the Property. Based on the research performed in this assessment, the inspection of the property, discussions with persons knowledgeable about the property, and reviews of regulatory agency files, the conclusion reached in this investigation is that there are no significant, recognized environmental conditions that affect the use or regulatory liability associated with the subject property.

(PGE) was retained was retained by Michael Gearon of Helios Hanalei LLC, Owner of the subject property, to conduct a Phase I Environmental Site Assessment (ESA) in conformance with ASTM International (ASTM) Practice E 1527- 13, Standard for Environmental Site Assessments. The subject property is located at Khi Highway at the intersection of Hanalei Plantation Road in Princeville, Island of Kaua`i , Hawai`i . It is designated as Tax Map Key (TMK): (4) 5-4-004:032; hereinafter referred to as \" the site, the subject property and/or the property\". The objective of this assessment was to determine the presence or absence of recognized environmental conditions (REC), as defined in ASTM, International (ASTM) 1527- 13. There are no exceptions or deletions from ASTM Practice E 1527- 13. 1.2 Purpose This Phase I ESA was requested by the client, to document the environmental condition of the subject property as part of due diligence for the potential development of a single -family residence on the property. PGE conducted this Phase I ESA to identify RECs associated with the property. The purpose of this practice is to define good commercial and customary practice in the United States of America (U.S.) for conducting an ESA of a parcel of commercial real estate with respect to the range of contaminants within the scope of the Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation and Liability Act (CERCLA) (42 U.S. Code [U.S.C.] \u00a79601) and petroleum products. As such, this practice is intended to permit a user to satisfy one of the requirements to qualify for the innocent landowner, contiguous property owner, or bona de prospective purchaser limitations on CERCLA liability (hereinafter, the \"landowner liability protections,\" or \"LLPs\"): that is, the practice that constitutes all appropriate inquiries into the previous ownership and uses of the property consistent with good commercial and customary practice as dened at 42 U.S.C. \u00a79601(35)(B). For the purposes of this practice: The definition of a release includes contamination in the soil vapor phase, as well as in soil or groundwater. \"Migrate' and \"migration\" refer to the movement of hazardous substances or petroleum products in any form, including solid and liquid at the surface or subsurface and vapor in the subsurface. Vapor migration/intrusion does not fall under the category of an Indoor Air Quality concern, which is not included in the ASTM 1527 scope of work. ASTM guidance defines a REC as the presence or likely presence of any hazardous substances or petroleum products in, on, or at a property: (1) due to any release to the environment; (2) under conditions indicative of a release to the environment; or (3) under conditions that pose a material threat of a future release to the environment (ASTM 2013). Controlled RECs (CREC) are defined as a REC resulting from a past release of hazardous substances or petroleum products that has been addressed to the satisfaction of the applicable regulatory authority (for example, as evidenced by the issuance of a no further action (NFA) letter Phase I ESA Gearon Hanalei Property Princeville, Kaua'i, Hawai'i Section 1 Introduction July 2017 1-2 or equivalent, or meeting risk -based criteria established by regulatory authority), with hazardous substances or petroleum products allowed to remain in place subject to the implementation of required controls (for example, property use restrictions, activity and use limitations, institutional controls, or engineering controls) (ASTM 2013). Historic al RECs (HREC) are defined as a past release of any hazardous substances or petroleum products that has occurred in connection with the property and has been addressed to the satisfaction of the applicable regulatory authority or meeting unrestricted use criteria established by a regulatory authority, without subjecting the property to any required controls (for example, property use restrictions, activity and use limitations, institutional controls, or engineering controls) (ASTM 2013). RECs do not include de minimis conditions that generally do not present a threat to human health or the environment and that generally would not be the subject of an enforcement action if brought to the attention of appropriate governmental agencies (ASTM 2013). Health or environmental de minimis conditions will be noted in this report as Potential Environmental Concerns. 1.3 Detailed Scope- of-Services This Phase I ESA was performed under the conditions of, and in general accordance with PGE s' Proposal, dated May 18, 2017, and with the ASTM Standard Practice for Environmental Site Assessments: Phase I Environmental Site Assessment Process (ASTM Designation E 1527- 13). Adherence to the ASTM standard is intended to limit liability of property owners from inherited environmental contamination. The Phase I ESA included the following tasks: Review of regulatory records. PGE reviewed standard environmental record sources including the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) Comprehensive Environmental Response Compensation and Liability Information System (CERCLIS) database, U.S. EPA's Resource Conservation and Recovery Act (RCRA) database, U.S. Institutional Controls database, U.S. Engineering Controls database, U.S. EPA's Emergency Response Notification System (ERNS) dat abase, State of Hawai`i Department of Health (HDOH) Hazard Evaluation and Emergency Response (HEER) Office site list, HDOH Underground Storage Tank (UST) lists, HDOH list of landfills and other solid waste facilities, HDOH Voluntary Response Program (VRP) sites list, and the HDOH Brownfield sites list. Review of site history. PGE reviewed reasonably ascertainable standard historical sources including historical maps; aerial photographs; building permits, zoning records, and property tax records available online; various printed publications as well as publications posted on the internet; and documents and/or records provided by the user's/owner's representative. Review of site geology and hydrogeology. PGE reviewed reasonably ascertainable published information on surface and subsurface conditions at the site and surrounding area. PGE used this information to assess topography, drainage, surface water bodies, anticipated subsurface geology, and groundwater occurrence and usage in the area. Site reconnaissance. PGE performed a site reconnaissance of the property to note visual signs of contamination, and conducted a limited assessment of portions of the neighboring properties visible from the subject property boundaries. During the site reconnaissance PGE specifically looked for hazardous substances; petroleum products; aboveground storage tanks (AST) and USTs; odors; pools of liquid; drums; electrical and ESA Gearon Princeville, Kaua'i, Hawai'i Section 1 Introduction July 2017 1-3 means of heating and cooling structures; stains or corrosion; drains and sumps; pits, ponds, or lagoons; stained soil or pavement; stressed vegetation; solid waste; wastewater; wells; and septic systems. Interviews. PGE interviewed available personnel familiar with the site conditions and/or history of site use. Data evaluation and report preparation. PGE evaluated the information collected and prepared this report that documents our assessment and presents our findings, opinions, and conclusions. 1.4 Significant Assumptions Significant assumptions include the following: 1) The information provided by the owner/user and the owner/user representatives is complete and accurate; 2) The information provided by the tenants and the tenant representatives is complete and accurate; 3) The information provided by the regulatory database search service is complete and accurate; and 4) The responses of government agencies to public requests for information are complete and accurate. 1.5 Limitations and Exceptions Phase I ESAs, by their very nature, are limited. PGE has endeavored to meet what it believes is the applicable standard of care and, in so doing is obliged to advise its client of Phase I ESA limitations. This Phase I ESA did not assess environmental issues or conditions at the property that are outside the scope of ASTM Practice E1527- 13, including, but not limited to, asbestos - containing material (ACM), biological agents, cultural and historical resources, ecological resources, endangered species, health and safety, indoor air quality unrelated to releases of hazardous substances or petroleum products into the environment, industrial hygiene, lead- based paint (LBP), lead in drinking water, mold, radon, regulatory compliance, and wetlands, nor did it include any sampling or testing for biological agents and mold, radon, methane, ACM, LBP, or other environmental contaminants. Our investigation was limited to the procedures described in the Phase I ESA Standard Practice (ASTM 2013). The conclusions presented in this report are professional opinions based solely upon visual observations of the site and vicinity and our interpretation of the available historical and regulatory information and documents reviewed.

Phase I ESA Gearon Hanalei Property Princeville, Kaua'i, Hawai'i Section 4 Records Review July 2017 4-1 Section 4 Records Review 4.1 Standard Environmental Record Sources 4.1.1 Overview To identify the presence of adverse environmental conditions at the subject property, several published sources of environmental records were reviewed. This section lists the records that were searched and the results of each search. ASTM E1527 -13 specifies search distances for specific environmental record sources. The following record sources were searched for incidents or sites within the listed search distances of the subject property: Standard Environmental Record Sources Search Distance ( miles) Number of Sites Identified Federal NPL site list 1.0 0 Federal Delisted NPL site list 0.5 0 Federal CERCLIS list 0.5 0 Federal CERCLIS NFRAP site list 0.5 0 Federal RCRA CORRACTS facilities list 1.0 0 Federal RCRA Non -CORRACTS TSD facilities list 0.5 0 Federal RCRA generators list Subject and Adjacent properties 1 Federal IEC registries Subject property only 0 Federal ERNS list Subject property only 0 State list of hazardous waste sites identified for investigation or remediation (NPL or CERCLIS equivalents) 1.0 0 State landfill and/or solid waste disposal site lists 0.5 0 State LUST list 0.5 2 State registered UST list Subject and Adjacent properties 3 State IEC registries Subject and Adjacent properties 0 State VRP sites 0.5 0 State and U.S Brownfield sites 0.5 0 Note: NPL = National Priorities List NFRAP = No Further Remedial Action Planned CORRACTS = facilities subject to Corrective Action under RCRA TSD = treatment, storage, and disposal IEC = institutional / engineering controls LUST = leaking underground storage tank PGE used an online regulatory database search service, provided by EDR, to review the above Federal and State government databases. A copy of the EDR report is included in Appendix C. The following sect ions summarize the findings of the regulatory database search. In reviewing the environmental databases, it should be noted that such databases are not instantaneously updated by the specific regulatory agencies. Depending on the database and the agency, update frequency may be as infrequent as annually. The dates of the most recent updates for the searched environmental databases are listed in the EDR report in Appendix C. Phase I ESA Gearon Hanalei Property Princeville, 4-2 4.1.2 Federal NPL Site List The Federal NPL is a subset of CERCLIS and identifies over 1,200 sites identified for priority cleanup under the Superfund Program. The ASTM -designated search distance for the Federal NPL is one mile. EDR did not identify Federal NPL sites within one mile of the subject property. 4.1.3 Federal Delisted NPL Site List The National Oil and Hazardous Substances Pollution Contingency Plan establish the criteria that the U.S. EPA uses to delete sites from the NPL. In accordance with 40 Code of Federal Regulations (CFR) 300.425(e), sites may be deleted from the NPL where no further response is appropriate. The ASTM -designated search distance for Federal delisted NPL sites is one- half mile. EDR did not identify Federal delisted NPL sites within one- half mile of the subject property. 4.1.4 Federal CERCLIS List The CERCLIS list contains data on potentially hazardous sites that have been reported to the U.S. EPA by states, municipalities, private companies, and private persons pursuant to Section 103 of CERCLA. CERCLIS contains sites which are either proposed to be, or on the NPL and sites which are in the screening and assessment phase for possible inclusion on the NPL. The ASTM -designated search distance for Federal CERCLIS sites is one- half mile. EDR did not identify any Federal CERCLIS site within one- half mile of the subject property. 4.1.5 Federal CERCLIS NFRAP Site List Archived sites are sites that have been removed and archived from the inventory of CERCLIS sites. Archived status indicates that, to the best of U.S. EPA's knowledge, assessment at a site has been completed and that U.S. EPA has determined no further steps will be taken to list this site on the NPL, unless information indicates this decision was not appropriate or other considerations require a recommendation for listing at a later time. This decision does not necessarily mean that there is no hazard associated with a given site; it only means that, based upon available information, the location is not judged to be a potential NPL site. The ASTM - designated search distance for Federal CERCLIS NFRAP sites is one- half mile. EDR did not identify any Federal CERCLIS NFRAP sites within one- half mile of the site. 4.1.6 Federal RCRA CORRACTS Facilities List U.S. EPA's facilities subject to CORRACTS or Corrective Action Sites database, identifies facilities that generate, treat, store, or dispose of hazardous wastes where RCRA corrective action activity has occurred. These sites have experienced spills or releases of hazardous chemicals prompting the need for corrective action. The ASTM -designated search distance for the Federal RCRA CORRACTS list is one mile. EDR did not locate any CORRACTS sites within one mile of the subject property. 4.1.7 Federal RCRA Non- COR CORRACTS TSD facilities list is the U.S. EPA's list of TSD facilities that are not currently subject to corrective action. The RCRAInfo is U.S. EPA's comprehensive information system, providing access to data supporting the RCRA of 1976 and the Hazardous and Solid Waste Amendments of 1984. RCRAInfo replaces the data recording and reporting abilities of the Resource Conservation and Recovery Information System. The database includes selective information on sites which generate, transport, store, treat and/or dispose of hazardous waste as defined by the RCRA. The RCRAInfo list includes facilities that treat, store, dispose of, or incinerate hazardous waste (TSD facilities). The ASTM -designated search distanc e for Federal Non -CORRACTS TSD facilities is one -half not Federal RCRA Non- CORRACTS TSD sites within one -half mile of the subject property. Phase I ESA Gearon Hanalei Property Princeville, Kaua'i, Hawai'i 2017 4-3 4.1.8 Federal RCRA Generators List In addition to TSD facilities discussed above in Section 4.1.7, the RCRAInfo list also includes selective information on sites that generate hazardous waste as defined by the RCRA. Conditionally exempt small quantity generators (CESQG) generate less than 100 kilograms of hazardous waste, or less than one kg of acutely hazardous waste per month. Small quantity generators (SQG) generate between 100 kg and 1,000 kg of hazardous waste per month. Large quantity generators generate over 1,000 kg of hazardous waste, or over one kg of acutely hazardous waste per month . The ASTM -designated search distance for Federal RCRA generators is the subject property and adjacent properties. EDR identified one Federal RCRA Generator sites on or adjacent to the subject property. General information on the RCRA site is provided below, and more detailed information is provided in the EDR report in Appendix C. Federal RCRA Generators Site Name Location Relative to the Subject Property Site Status/Comments Princeville Corporation 4520 Hanalei Plantation rd. \u00bc mile NNE (higher elevation / upgradient) RCRA -Small Quantity Generator for generation of used oil. Violations = Written informal only, case closed. Although this site is not adjacent to subject site, it's significance to the subject property was evaluated. It is identified as the Princeville Corporation's Makai Equipment Shop. Compliance inspections indicated the handling of used motor oil. Due to it's distance from the subject property it does not pose an environmental liability to the subject property. 4.1.9 Federal Institutional / Engineering Controls Registries Federal IEC Registries are lists of sites that have institutional and/or engineering controls in place. Institutional controls include administrative measures, such as groundwater use restrictions, construction restrictions, property use restrictions, and post remediation care requirements intended to prevent exposure to contaminants remaining on site. Deed restrictions are generally required as part of the institutional controls. Engineering controls include various forms of caps, building foundations, liners, and treatment methods to create pathway elimination for regulated substances to enter environmental media or effect human health. The ASTM -designated search distance for Federal IEC Registries is the subject property only. EDR did not identify the subject property as a Federal IEC Registry site. 4.1.10 Federal ERNS List ERNS is a national database of more than 365,000 records, which contains information on specific notification of releases of oil and hazardous substances to the environment. The ASTM - designated search distance for Federal ERNS incidents is the subject property only. No reported Federal ERNS incidents have occurred on the subject property. 4.1.11 State of Hawai`i Hazardous Waste Sites List The State of Hawai`i Hazardous Waste Sites (SHWS) list is Hawai`i's equivalent to the NPL or CERCLIS. These sites may or may not already be listed on the federal NPL or CERCLIS list. Priority sites planned for cleanup using state funds (state equivalent of Superfund) are identified along with sites where cleanup will be paid for by potentially responsible parties. The HDOH HEER Office maintains a Sites of Interest Database, which includes sites that HDOH HEER has an interest in, has investigated, or may investigate under Hawai`i Revised Statute 128D (the State Superfund law). The ASTM -designated search distance for the SHWS List is one mile. EDR did not identify any SHWS sites within one mile of the subject property. Phase I ESA Gearon Hanalei Property Princeville, Kaua'i, Hawai'i Section 2017 4-4 4.1.12 State of Hawai`i Landfill and/or Solid Waste Disposal Site List HDOH SHWB has a list of permitted solid waste disposal facilities and landfills in the State of Hawai`i. The ASTM -designated search distance for permitted solid waste disposal sites / landfills is one- half mile of the subject property. EDR did not identify permitted landfills or solid waste disposal facility sites within one- half mile of the subject prope rty. 4.1.13 State of Hawai`i LUST List The State of Hawai`i LUST database, compiled by the HDOH SHWB UST Section, contains an inventory of reported LUST incidents. The ASTM -designated search distance for State of Hawai`i LUST sites is one-half mile. EDR ident ified two State of Hawai`i LUST sites within one- half mile of the subject property. General information on the State of Hawai`i LUST sites are provided below, and more detailed information is provided in the EDR report in Appendix C. LUST Site Name Location Relative to the Subject Property Site Status/Comments Kaua`i County Hanalei Police/Fire Station 5-4390 Kuhio Highway NE (higher upgradient) -Site 9-702798: NFA -Site Cleanup completed 12/28/1995 It is not likely that these LUST sites would negatively impact the subject property due to their regulatory status (i.e., NFA), distance from, and/or location relative to the subject property . 4.1.14 State of Hawai`i Registered UST List State of Hawai`i Registered USTs are regulated under RCRA and must be registered with the state department responsible for administering the UST program. The list of registered UST sites is compiled by the HDOH SHWB UST Section. The ASTM -designated search distance for S tate of Hawai`i Registered UST sites is the subject property and adjacent properties. EDR identified three State of Hawai`i Registered UST sites on adjacent properties. UST Site Name Location Relative to the Subject Property Site Status/Comments Kaua`i County Hanalei Police/Fire Station 5-4390 Kuhio Highway NE (higher / upgradient) 9-701066: NFA -Site Cleanup completed 6/26/2002 Princeville Chevron Station Highway >\u00bc mile NNE elevation / upgraidient) 9-702798 : two 6,000-gallon diesel USTs, one 4,000-gallon gasoline UST, one 3000- gallon gasoline UST and one 7,000- gallon gasoline UST. They are reported as currently in use. Princeville Central Office (Hawaii an Tel Com) 54-378 Kuhio Highway 1/8 mile NE (higher elevation/ upgradient) 9-700612: Currently in use. 600 -gallon Diesel. 550 -gallon diesel = permanently out of use. Financial Assurance=Insurance It is not likely that the State of Hawai`i UST sites, listed above, has negatively impacted the subject property due to its distance from and/or location relative to the subject property and their current regulatory status. Phase I ESA Gearon Hanalei Property Princeville, Kaua'i, Hawai'i Section 4 Records Review July 2017 4-5 4.1.15 State of Hawai`i Institutional / Engineering Controls Registry The ASTM -designated search distance for State of Hawai`i IEC registries is the subject and adjacent properties. EDR did not identify any State of Hawai`i IEC registries on the subject or adjacent properties. 4.1.16 State of Hawai`i Voluntary Cleanup Sites The ASTM -designated search distance for State of Hawai`i VRP sites is one -half mile. EDR did not identify any State of Hawai`i VRP sites within one- half mile of the subject property. 4.1.17 State of Hawai`i Brownfield Sites The ASTM -designated search distance for State of Hawai`i Brownfield sites is one -half mile. EDR did not identify any State of Hawai`i Brownfield site within one- half mile of the subject property. 4.2 Physical Setting Sources 4.2.1 U.S. Geological Survey (USGS) Topographic Map Coverage Topographic map coverage of the site is included on the USGS 7.5- minute Hanalei quadrangle map, as shown (portion of) on Figure 1. The approximate coordinates of the subject property is 22\u00b0 12' 39.44'' North latitude and 159\u00b0 28' 52.31'' West longitude. The property is located approximately 260 feet above mean sea level at it's hig hest elevation down to about 40 feet above mean sea level at it's lowest elevation. 4.2.2 Geologic Setting PGE reviewed published geologic reports and maps to obtain information regarding subsurface conditions in the general area of the site and to evaluate potential migration of contaminants. Kaua`i is the oldest and most complex of the eight major Hawai`ian Islands. It has subsided more than any other island and its original volcanic shield underwent large -scale structural displacement and erosion before much of it was covered by renewed volcanism. The Koloa volcanic series greatly enlarged Kaua`i 's land mass, filling deep valleys and covering the irregular topography of the eroded primary volcanic dome in the eastern half of the island (Mink and Lau, 1992). 4.2.3 Hydrogeology PGE reviewed published hydrogeological reports and maps to obtain information regarding subsurface conditions in the general area of the site and to evaluate potential migration of contaminants. There are no groundwater wells or injection wells on the subject property. There is one domestic wells within one half mile of subject property. The subject property is situated above the underground injection control (UIC) line, according to the Hawai`i Department of Health Safe Drinking Water Branch Island of Kaua`i Underground Injection Control Areas Program Map, November 2014. According to the Map, the property is located in UIC Code 100, which means it is above (mauka) of the UIC line. Generally, this means the underlying aquifer is considered a potential drinking water source aquifer. Phase I ESA Gearon Hanalei Property Princeville, Kaua'i, Hawai'i Section 4 Records Review July 2017 4-6 Underground Injection Wells are wells used for injecting water or other fluids into a groundwater aquifer. Department of Health Administrative Rules, Title 11, Chapter 23 provides conditions governing the location, construction, and operation of injection wells so that injected fluids do not migrate and pollute underground sources of drinking water. According to the Hawai`i Department of Health Safe Drinking Water Branch Ground Water Contamination Viewer, Island of Kaua`i Map, 2017, public wells on the north shore of Kaua`i comply with state and federal drinking water standards for contaminants. No regulated contaminant s have been found in domestic water wells sources in the Princeville and Hanalei areas. Present and historical activities on the subject property are unlikely to negatively affect aquifers below the site. 4.2.4 Soils The soils in the area of the subject property are identified by the United States Department of Agriculture Soil Conservation Service Report as the Kapaa -Pooku -Halii- Makapili association: Deep nearly level to steep, well drained and moderately well drained soils that have a fine textured or moderately fine textured subsoil; on uplands. These soils of this association are historically used for pasture, irrigated sugarcane, pineapple, wildlife habitat, woodland and water supply. (Foote et al., 1972) The specific soils at the Site are a silty clay that fall within the Makapili Series. The Makapili Series consists of well -drained soils on uplands on the island of Kaua`i . The mean annual soil temperature is 71 degrees Fahrenheit. These soils developed in material weathered from basic indigenous rock. They ar e nearly level to steep. Detailed site soil information can be found in Geotechnical Report that was conduct at the site by JPB Engineering, Inc (See Section 10 References) . 4.2.5 Surface Water The site has no surface waters. The closest surface water body to the site is Hanalei River, to the south of the property. Princeville Resort has an irrigation pond associated with the golf course, that is located approximately 1/2 mile north of the subject site . Overall, there is no evidence of significant surface flows to the subject property originating from neighboring properties. There may be some drainage from the highway on the Northeast side of the property boundary . The Final Environmental Assessment Khi Slope Stabilization describes efforts to grade the area on the north side of the property along Khi highway so that runoff would not go down the hill and create additional erosion. The property may also have seeps and springs, but none were noted during the site visit. 4.3 Historical Use Information 4.3.1 Standard Historical Sources Historical use of the subject and adjacent properties was obtained by reviewing the following standard historical sources: aerial photographs ; fire insurance maps ; real property tax records; recorded land title records; historica l topographic maps ; oth er historical maps; local street Phase I ESA Gearon Hanalei Property Princeville, Hawai'i Section 4 Records Review July 2017 4-7 directories; various printed publications and publications posted on the internet; documents, maps, and information from interviews. 4.3.2 Aerial Photograph Review PGE reviewed available historical aerial photographs of the subject property dated 1951, 1959, 1960, 1975, 1978, 1992, 2004, 2006, 2011, 2012, 2013, and 2014 (EDR 2017b, Google Earth 2017 and RM Towill area. ). A copy of the EDR historical aerial photographs are included in Appendix C. General observations include: 1951 EDR Aerial photo- This good resolution photo shows the present day alignment of Khi Highway surrounding most of the property. To the north, beyond Khi Highway, the property is in pasture. There is only one house evident. On the subject property, there appears to be an unimproved access (very close to the present day access to the bluff) that leads to the westernmost end of the property. 1959/1960 EDR Aerial photos - These low resolution photos shows two lots (likely residential) being developed just north of the property near the property's present day entrance. 1975 EDR Aerial photo- This low resolution photo shows the Princeville resort area's initial development. More development is occurring just north across the highway. 1978 EDR Aerial photo- This good resolution photo shows the property largely overgrown and in not in any particular use. Residential development continues just north of the property. 1989 RM Towill Aerial photo- This good resolution photo appears to show the footprint of the present day KIUC substation to the east of the property. 1992 EDR Aerial photo - This poor resolution photo shows the significant amount of buildout in the Princeville resort area since the 1978 photo. RECs and/or environmental concerns were not identified during the review of the aerial photographs . 4.3.3 Sanborn Fire Insurance Maps There are no historical Sanborn fire insurance maps of the area. This is indicative of the rural area history of Princeville. 4.3.4 Historical Topographic Map Review PGE reviewed available USGS topographic maps of the area dated 1963, 1983, 2013 (EDR 2017d). A copy of the USGS topographic maps is included in Appendix C. General observations include: 1910 topo- This topo shows the original road into Hanalei Valley, some of which may have traversed onto a portion of the west end of the property. 1963 topo- This topo shows the present day Khi highway and Hanalei Plantation Road alignments. It shows building footprints of the former Princeville Ranch headquarters at the present day entrance to Princeville. Phase I ESA Gearon Hanalei Property Princeville, 4 Records Review July 2017 4-8 RECs and/or potential environmental concerns were not identified during review of the historical topographic maps. 4.3.5 Other Historical Map s Review PGE reviewed various other historical maps of the area available online from University of Hawai`i at Manoa Library. (University of Hawai`i 2017). PGE also reviewed a historical Kaua`i Electric map (c.1960). RECs and/or potential environmental concerns were not identified during review of these historical maps. 4.3.6 Local Street Directories PGE reviewed local street directories dated 1992, 1995, 1999, 2003, 2008, and 2013 for Khi Highway and Hanalei Plantation Road. (EDR 2017e). There were no tenants identified on the subject property. Various commercial tenants were identified in the Princeville shopping center. RECs and/or potential environmental concerns were not identified during review of the local street directories. 4.3.7 Summary of Historical Land Us e PGE reviewed the historical use of the subject and adjacent properties from readily available standard historical sources. A brief summary of the historical use of the area and subject and adjacent properties is provided below. Historical p rior uses may have include pasture, traditional travel to mauka /makai lands by trail/road (which may have traversed the property) , cultural use and other natural resources. Otherwise the property has remained undeveloped. The subject property boundaries were defined by the Kaua`i Belt Road construction, which likely happened in the 1940's. Each of the documented uses would not be indicative of uses creating RECs and/or environmental concerns. Phase I ESA Gearon Hanalei Property Princeville, Kaua'i, Hawai'i Section 5 Site Reconnaissance 2017 5-1Section 5 Site R econnaissance A site reconnaissanc e was conducted by Mr. Howard Greene on May 22, 2017. The site reconnaissance included visual surveys of the property and brief surveys of the visible portions of the adjacent parc els. Site photographs are included in Appendix A. 5.1 Site Observations The entrance is gated and graveled and the bluff closely mowed. Inspection limitations include that much of the slope on the south side of the property was not accessible due to slope and/or vegetation. I could not find definitive property boundary markers on the east property line. Very little trash was found on the property. This is likely due to cleanup and debris removal during installation of slope stabilization improvements. Among the debris found included a black plastic tarp, shovel, plastic bottles and cans. Rock slope netting and anchors are evident . Anchors and cables on the north side of the property supporting steel mesh netting on the southern side above the highway. Piles of topsoil are at various locations around the cleared bluff area. They appear to be topsoil from clearing of the bluff a s opposed to imported soil stockpiles . Recently disturbed trenches from geotech investigations were noted. On the western point of the property was a cleared area around stone features, reportedly a possible cultural site. There are no public utilities or improvements other than slope stabi lization components on the hill side. There were no hazardous substances or petroleum products stored on the property. As well, there were no storage tanks or drums present/abandoned on the property. PGE did not observe any stressed vegetation or staining. 5.2 Adjacent Proper ty Observations The property is surrounded on the north, west and south by Khi Highway. Beyond Khi Highway to the north is residential and commercial uses. There is the County of Kaua`i Fire and Police station. They have a 5,000-ga llon double walled abov e ground tank. To the east of here is more residential and beyond that, the Princeville Shopping center. The east of the property is bordered by the Hanalei National Wildlife Refuge. A lookout is just off Khi Highway and borders the subject property. KIUC has an easement for a substation at the bottom of the hill near Hanalei Bridge and associated transmission lines. Below Khi Highway, north of Hanalei River, the area is in use as a ranch (currently Buffalo). Each of the uses on adjacent properties did not appear to have uses that would pose environmental concerns to the subject property.

Eric Guinther -Eric is with AECOS, Inc. whom conducted the Natural Resource survey of the property.Phase I ESA Gearon Hanalei Property Princeville, Kaua'i, Hawai'i Section 7 Findings, Opinions, and Conclusions July 2017 7-1Section 7 Findings, Opinions, and Conclusions PGE has conducted a Phase I ESA in conformance with ASTM Practice E 1527 -13, Standard Practice for Environmental Site Assessments. The purpose of this Phase I ESA was to identify recognized environmental conditions (REC). ASTM guidance defines a REC as the presence or likely presence of any hazardous substances or petroleum products, in, on, or at the property: (1) due to any release to the environment; (2) under conditions indicative of a release to the environment; or (3) under conditions that pose a material threat of a future release to the environment. 7.1 Findings No indications of recognized environmental conditions were noted during the site inspection of the subject property. Past and present neighboring commercial and residenti al activities investigated should not be expected to have adverse impact on the subject property. Regulatory status of past and present USTs and LUSTs, and their respective distances away, would be unlikely to create REC affecting the subject property. Any other de minimus activities on the site likely would not have used hazardous materials in quantities to indicate a recognized environmental condition exists. Interviews with persons familiar with the site did not reveal any situations that could be const rued as a recognized environmental condition. When each was specifically asked if they had any knowledge of current situations or past events that might present environmental liability to the owners or tenants of the subject property, none of these persons indicated that they had any such knowledge. There have not been any documented agricultural, industrial, military, or other uses documented that would indicate the presence of significant amounts of hazardous materials. There is no historic evidence of any dumping or storage of hazardous materials or significant quantities of petroleum products on the subject property. 7.2 Opinions None of the activities observed on neighboring properties would be expected to have any significant, adverse environmental conditions that may affect subject property. The inspection and investigation of the property and neighboring properties did not reveal any evidence of significant hazardous materials use, spills or releases. Current and historic operations and uses at the property would not be likely to create any adverse environmental conditions. In addition, past uses investigated would also not be likely to create any adverse environmental conditions. Further environmental investigation relating to the presence of recognized environmental conditions affecting the subject property is not warranted. Phase I ESA Gearon Hanalei Property Princeville, Kaua'i, Hawai'i Section 7 Findings, Opinions, and Conclusions July 2017 7-27.3 Conclusions Present and past uses of the subject property have no recognized environmental conditions that would have an environmental liability impact to neighboring properties or the subject property. Based on the research performed in this assessment, the inspection of the property, discussions with persons knowledgeable about the property, and reviews of regulatory agency files, t he conclusion reached in this investigation is that there are no significant, recognized environmental conditions that affect the use or regulatory liability associated with the subject property. Phase I ESA Gearon Hanalei Property Princeville, Kaua'i, Hawai'i Section 8 Deviations July 2017 8-1Section 8 Deviations In conducting this Phase I ESA, there were no deletions from the standard practice (ASTM Designation E1527 -13 and E2600- 10) and no client -imposed constraints.

The list was formerly known as the CERCLIS-NFRAP,renamed to SEMS ARCHIVE by the EPA in 2015. EPA may perform a minimal level of assessment work at a site whileit is archived if site conditions change and/or new information becomes available. Archived sites have been removedand archived from the inventory of SEMS sites. Archived status indicates that, to the best of EPA's knowledge,assessment at a site has been completed and that EPA has determined no further steps will be taken to list thesite on the National Priorities List (NPL), unless information indicates this decision was not appropriate orother considerations require a recommendation for listing at a later time. The decision does not necessarily meanthat there is no hazard associated with a given site; it only means that. based upon available information, thelocation is not judged to be potential NPL site.

Beingon the Watch List does not mean that the facility has actually violated the law only that an investigation byEPA or a state or local environmental agency has led those organizations to allege that an unproven violationhas in fact occurred. Being on the Watch List does not represent a higher level of concern regarding the allegedviolations that were detected, but instead indicates cases requiring additional dialogue between EPA, state andlocal agencies - primarily because of the length of time the alleged violation has gone unaddressed or unresolved.

Manufactured gas sites were used in the United States from the 1800's to 1950'sto produce a gas that could be distributed and used as fuel. These plants used whale oil, rosin, coal, or a mixtureof coal, oil, and water that also produced a significant amount of waste. Many of the byproducts of the gas production,such as coal tar (oily waste containing volatile and non-volatile chemicals), sludges, oils and other compoundsare potentially hazardous to human health and the environment. The byproduct from this process was frequentlydisposed of directly at the plant site and can remain or spread slowly, serving as a continuous source of soiland groundwater contamination.

The subject parcel includes all of the land within the upper horseshoe curve of Khi Highway, beginni ng i m m e d i a t e l y w e s t o f t h e H a n a l e i V a l l e y L o o k o u t . M u c h o f t h e p r operty is moderately to very steep. A single family residence, to includ e a swimming pool and ancillary improvements, is proposed for the more or less le vel, western portion of the parcel as indicated in Fig. 1. The land is in t he Resource Subzone of the state Conserv ation District. Methods Botanical Survey A botanical survey was undertaken by E. B. Guinther on May 30, 2017 using a wandering transect that covered the usable parts of the propert y, including the proposed house site and entrance driveway, and further covered the low to moderately sloping ground along Khi Highway from the highway bend up to the Hanalei Lookout at the eastern end of the parcel. Much of the remainder of the property is too steep to access safely (ranging in steepnes s from very steep to nearly vertical cliff, traver sing of this area creates a ris k to vehicular traffic on the lower portion of the Khi Highway loop from dislodged rock s). The latter area was surveyed by the author in 2008 for a rockfall mitigat ion project (AECOS, 2 0 0 8 ) .

More recent na me changes for naturalized plant species follow Imada (2012). Avian Survey The avian survey included three stationary pointcount stations in which all birds observed during an 8minute period were recorded within a visible radius Natural Resources TMK: 5-4-004:032, PRINCEVILLE , KAUA'I AECOS Inc. [FILE: 1492.DOCX ] Page | 3 of the observer and by listening for vocalizations. Pointcoun t stations were located near the center of the cleared portion of the property (\"House Site\", Sta. 1), near Khi Hwy across from the Princeville Fire Station (St a. 2), and near the east end of the property neighboring the Hanalei Valley Lookout ( S t a . 3 ) . Additionally, a running tally was kept of all bird species not observed during stationary point counts. Stationary point counts were con ducted between 0930 and 1100 on May 30, 2017. Weather conditions during the survey were ideal, with no rain, unlimited visibility, and calm winds. Species identifications were verif ied with: A Photographic Guide to the Birds of Hawaii: the Main Islands and Offshore Waters (Denny, 2010). Taxonomy follows t he Checklist of North and Mid dle American Birds by American Ornithologists' Union (AOU, 2014). Terrestrial Mammals Survey A list of mammal species observed in the project area was noted as biologists conducted botanical and avian surveys. Visual observation for tracks, scat, and other signs of mammalian use of the Project area were undertake n concurrent with our survey. Nomenclature for mammals follows the 3 rd edition of Mammal species of the world: a taxonomic and geographic reference (Wilson and Reeder, 2005). Results Botanical Survey The vegetation covering the eastern twothirds of the parcel is mostly mixed, secondary forest with a generally sparse understory. Between t he highway verge of the upper arm of the loop and the steep slopes along t he lower arm is a closed or nearly closed canopy forest of mostly introduced tree species: mango ( Trema orientalis ; see Figure 2). Also common in this area are \"native\" 1 hala (Pandanus tectorius) , nucifera), and hau (Hibiscus tiliaceus). Much of the area proposed for development on the western third of the parcel has been cleared, and is now a closecropped grassy field with a few scattered trees (Figure 3). It is evident from the 2011 satellite image (Fig. 1) that this 1 Native broadly defined here as e ncompassing endemic, indigenous , and early Polynesian introductions (socalled | 4 [2222008] Figure 2.

This scrubland extend ed over much of the western th ird of the property, and surrounds the nowcleared house site. A portion of the west facing slope, extending below the house site to the highway sup ports a mixture of trees and mostly shrubs, with waitabit ( Caesalpinia decapetala ) prominent. Scattered ornamentals are present, planted especially along the residence entrance driveway. A listing of plant species encountered on the parcel is given a s Table 1. This flora listing includes, in separate abundance columns, species noted in 2017 and in the report produced in 2008. A total of 12 species of ferns and 120 taxa of flowering plants are listed, representing all plants identified from the property in 2008 and 2017. As can be seen from Table 2, the two lists a ppear to differ substantially from each other in that the percent of total spec ies that were observed in both surveys is only around half or less of all spe cies listed.

Any number of factors (elapsed interval of nine years, different conditions with respect to rainfall received, alterat ions to the area including plantings of ornamenta ls) could account for shifts in s p e c i e s composition of the lesser species found at any given time in th e assemblage. Four of the 12 species of ferns identified are native species ( indigenous or endemic species). Among the flowering plants, 6 indigenous (5% ) and no Natural | 13 endemics are listed. Early Polynesian introductions total 5 (4 %). None of these species is considered rare in the Islands. Avian Survey During stationary pointcounts (SPC), nine species totaling 40 individual birds were observed utilizing the property (Table 3). An additional six birds of five different species were encountered while traversing the propert y between stations. 68 % of the birds observed during pointcounts.

T h e t w o exceptions include a single Northern Cardinal ( Cardinalis cardinalis ) and a Western Meadowlark ( Sturnella neglecta) that inhabited isolated trees at the residence site. Birds encountered at Stas. 2 and 3 were typica lly observed flying between the property and undeveloped parcels across Khi Hwy. Though Common Myna was most abundant, House Finch were present, albeit in lesser numbers. Terrestrial Mammals Survey No mammals nor signs of their presence were detected on the sub ject property during the survey. A domestic dog ( Canis l. familiaris ) was heard barking, the sound originating from houses no rth of the survey area, across Khi Hwy.

T h e p r o p e rty does support a number of old hala trees that provide an ambiance of a Hawaiian sense of place and these trees should be preserved to the exten t possible. These trees are sparsely scattered around the proposed building site, b u t a r e prominent in parts of the steepsloped eastern half of the parc el. Avian Resources The subject property had low numbers of birds on the survey dat e. Also, given the property's northern Kaua'i location near welldocumented po pulations of native birds, it is a little surprising that no native species were encountered. The Hawaiian Goose or nn (Branta sandvicensis ) is common in nearby Hanalei NWR and around the Princeville golf courses the Hawaiian Petrel ( Guinther, 2007; Guinther & Dav id, 2011), but were not observe d during our survey. 2 The archaeology team reported two nn spending much of the day fo llowing our survey at the house site (Nancy McMahon, pers. Natural Petrel Pterodroma sandwichensis ) Newell's Shearwat er (Puffinus auricularis newelli)\u2014have been documented in the region between April and the end of November each year (David, 1995; Morgan, et al., 200 3, 2004; David and Planning Solutions, 2008). Additionally, the Save Our Shea rwaters Program has recovered both species from the general area on an annual b asis over the past three decades (Morgan, et al., 2003, 2004; David and Plann ing Solutions, 2008; DOFAW, 2009). The petrel is listed as endanger ed, and the shearwater as threa tened under both federal and state endangered species statutes. The primary caus e of mortality in both Hawaiian Petrel and Newell' s Shearwater is thought to be p redation by alien mammalian species at the nesting colonies (USFWS, 1983; S imons and Hodges, 1998; Ainley, et al., 2001). Collision with manmade st ructures is considered to be the second most significant cause of mortality of these seabird species in Hawai'i. Nocturnally flying seabirds, especially fle dglings on their way to sea in the summer and fall, can become disoriented by exteri or lighting. When disoriented, seabirds may collide with manmade structures , and if not killed outright, become easy targets of opportunity for feral m ammals (Hadley, Day, 1994; Podolsky, et al ., 1998; Ainley, et al., 2001). Mammalian Resources No mammalian species currently protected or proposed for protec tion under either the federal or State of Hawai'i endangered species progr ams were detected during the course of this survey (DLNR, 1998; USFWS, 2 005, 2017). The findings of the mammalian survey are in keeping with the ha bitats present and the general nature of the pr oject site. It is likely that one or more of the four Muridae species European house mouse ( Mus musculus domesticus Rattus exulans hawaiiensis )all known to be established on the Island of Kaua'i, occur on or in the vicinity of the Pro ject on a regular basis. All a re introduced species. Hawaiian hoary bat The Hawaiian hoary bat ( Lasiurus cinereus semotus) or 'pe'ape'a, is an endangered species that is fairly common in the lowlands of Kaua'i (R. David, pers. comm.). Although not detected during t he course of our survey, it is likely that this endangered species uses resource s in the general P r o j e c t a r e a . T h e i m p a c t t h a t t h e P r o j e c t p o t e n t i a l l y p o s e s t o b a t s i s b y expanding clearing and grubbing to presently forested partds o f the property. Hawaiian hoary bats are foliageroosting, overdispersed mammal s; that is, they roost in low numbers widely separated from one another. Remova l of Natural Resources | 17 vegetation within the Project property may temporarily displace bats using trees there for roosting. However, these bats use multiple roo sts within their home territories and disturbance from the removal of a roosting tree is likely to be minimal. An exception is rem oval of trees during the bat pu pping season. Jurisdictional Waters and Critical Habitat No federal jurisdictional waters (streams or wetlands) occur an ywhere on the subject property. No federal Critical Habitat exists for any s pecies on or adjacent to the project area. Thus, modification of habitats on all or any part of the site will not result in an impact to federally designated C ritical Habitat. There is no equivalent statute under state law. The Hanalei National Wildlife Re fuge (NWR) lies adjacent at the far east end of the parcel (immediately below the Hanalei Valley Lookout). How ever, no h ab itats u s ed b y end ange red w i l dl ife o c c u r in th i s ar ea o f th e steep valley margin and no alterations to the Project parcel landscape are c ontemplated where the property boundary is c ongruent with the NWR boundary. Recommendations The following recommendations assume future development activit ies will be limited to a single residence wi th ancillary improvements as pe rmitted for lots within the Conservation District and suggest minimization measu res to ensure that future development not resu lt in deleterious impacts to pr otected species or natural resources. Consideration should be given to preservation of the many old hala (Pandanus ) trees located on the property. The location proposed for the residence offers spectacular view s of the Hanalei Valley and Hanalei Bay, but this very exposed and promi nent l o c a t i o n i s o n o n e o f t h e m o r e i m p o r t a n t f l y w a y s f o r e n d a n g e r e d Hawaiian Petrel and Newell's Shearwater moving between inland nesting sites and the ocean. Any exterior lighting may prove attractive to nocturnally flying seabirds (Reed et al., 1985; Telfer et al ., 1987) resulting in an adverse impact on the species. All exterior li ghts must be shielded to reduce interactions between these seabirds and the built environment. If construction activity is considered after sunset, all associ ated lights should be wellshielded, and where large flood/work lights are used, Natural KAUA'I AECOS Inc.

Avoiding nighttime work duri ng the peak of seabird fallout between September 15 and December 15 ca n minimize adverse impacts t o listed seabird species. In the event of a need to clear trees on the property, it is re commended that woody vegetation taller than 4.6 m (15 ft) not be cleared between June 1 and September 15, the Haw aiian hoary bat pupping season.

Lihue, Kaua'i, Hawai'i August 2107 EXPLORATION ASSOCIATES LTD ii Management Summary An archaeological inventory survey was conducted on a 14.109 acres pa rcel for a single -family residence to include a swimming pool and ancillary improvements at tax map key (TMK) (4) 5 -4- 004:032. The project area is defined as the single -family residence including the swimming pool and ancillary improvements. Currently, t his project area is fairly level and maintained in grass. Subsurface testing (6 backhoe trenches) were placed in the location of the proposed development. No cultural material or historic properties were found during the surface and subsurface work in the project area. Within the parcel, two historic properties were identified: Old Government Road portion ( SIHP# 50 -30-03-02353 ) and a pre-contact historic property with an unknown function (SIHP# 50 -30-03-02354 ). The location of these historic propert ies is well outside of the development area but on the parcel. SIHP# 50 -30-03-02353 is documented as significant under criteria d. No further work is recommended for this historic property but because of its location, it is being preserved \"as is\". SIHP# 50 -30-03-02354 is an approximately 15 x 7 -meter pre-contact historic property located in a dense area of guava forest. SIHP# 50 -30-03-02354 is significant under multiple criteria d and e . Four features have been identified with the historic property. Two mounds , one rock wall and several rough stones outlining a rough boundary of the historic property. Th is pre- contact historic property was overgrown with guava and all the rock features covered with 4 inches of moss. A preservation plan is recommended for this historic property, with further detailed mapping with appropriate buffers and will be maintained by the owner . It is outside of the single - family residence project area .

The p roposed project site is located approximately 0.5 miles south of Princeville, 1.5 miles northeast of Hanalei, and 1.3 miles from the Pacific Ocean . The project site lies with in the Resource Zone of the State Land Use Conservation District and the Special Management Area (SMA) in north -central Kaua' i, near Princeville on the ridge on the east side of Hana lei Valley . Surrounding land use include s commercial and public facilities as well as residential use and surrounding most of the parcel is Highway 56 0 (Kaua'i Belt Road which is listed on the Historic District on the Nation al and State Register of Historic Places which includes contributing features Hanalei Bridge [already on the National and State Register of Historic Places; Hanalei Valley Scenic Overlook and culvert , 2000 ). A driveway/gate and water meter have already been approved and installed to p rovide access from Khi Highway 560 (2014) by the previous owner the Richard Carlson Trust (SMA(M) -2015 -33 under CDUP KA - 3729. The SMA permit was approved on April 20, 2015 with seven (7) conditions and later amended to include Condition No. 8. On April 2 7, 2015, Condition No. 4 was amended to include additional archeological studies. No archaeological studies were conducted for this project. It was the understanding of the Planning Department, which the Kaua'i Archaeologist for the County of Kauai, Mary Jane Naone was going to do her own site inspection. No record of this field check could be found. Figure 2 is a topographic map of the parcel. Figure 3 is the USGS location map of the parcel. The parcel (4) 5 -4-004:032 is a total of 14.109 acres of par tially cleared land on the ridge plateau of underdeveloped lands. Figure 4 shows the aerial imagery for the parcel and surrounding area. The western portion of the parcel on the plateau of the ridge is where the single -family residence, to include a swimm ing pool and ancillary improvements will be located is cleared and fairly level. This location is maintained in short grass, with ornament al plants in a few locations on the borders of the grass. Much of the rest of the parcel is in moderate to steep slopes, especially on the southern portion of the property adjacent to the Highway 560 and US Fish and Wildlife land. The land title history is it is comprised of a portion of land covered by Land Patent Grant Number 4845 to Albert S. Wilcox; being a portion of Land deeded by Kamehameha IV to Charles Titcomb, Apana 2, February 12, 1856, and being a portion of Parcel 4 -A (Princeville Ranch). Fieldwork was carried out by Exploration Associates Ltd, archaeologists Nancy McMahon, M.A, Linz Armstrong, B.A. and Mil ton Ching. Dates of fieldwork are October 21, 2016, November 19, 2016, December 1, 2016 and in 2017 on April 19- 26, May 30- 31, and July 14th. Fieldwork included surface survey of the parcel, subsurface testing of the project area (single family residence) and clearing/ sketch mapping rock features of the pre -contact historic property . State Historic Preservation Division staff made EXPLORATION ASSOCIATES LTD 2 field visits on October 19, 2016 (burial site specialist, Kauanoe Hoomanawanui); May 17, 2017 (Head of the Archaeological Bran ch, archaeologist, Susan Lebo, PhD) and June 27, 2017 (archaeologists Stephanie Hacker, M.A. and Garnett Clark, B.A.). Kauai/Niihau Burial Council member Barbara Say, and her son Pierre and the neighbor across the street, Donna Gomez -Netzer also visited t he property to look for an old Chinese cemetery, which was said to be there on the property. The project area is surrounded by known historic properties. Registered Historic Places, Khi Highway (Route 560) was placed on the Hawai`i State Register of Historic Places (SRHP) in 2003 and on the National Register of Historic Places (NRHP) in 2004 under the Site Name Kaua`i Belt Road (Site Number 30 -03- 9396). Under the criteria establishe d by the SRHP and NRHP, the highway is recognized for its association with events that have made a significant contribution to the broad patterns of the island's history. It is also an embodiment of the distinctive type, period, and method of construction for that time in history. Among the physical, historic, and character -defining qualities of the Highway are the: Almost unchanged alignment of the road since its completion in the early 1900s Original or historic width and frequent absence of shoulders , as were the conditions in the late 1920s Presence of numerous one -lane bridges representing the construction methodology and material type of their original period of construction Guardrails and barrier walls that were constructed of timber- beam/concr ete-post or masonry rock construction (Belt Collins 2005) Approximately 20 archaeological historic properties have been recorded in the Hanalei area. Hanalei's archaeological resources include irrigated lo`i or pondfields, habitation sites, other agricultu ral sites, a'uwai (irrigation ditches), and two pre -contact historic property . While most of the archaeological sites are found near the coast, some have been found four miles up the Hanalei Valley. These inland historic properties include lo`i, habitation sites, and two pre -contact historic property . The parcel itself, has been undeveloped except for the old government road sections which was identified during this survey. According to preliminary architectural plans (Design Concepts, 2017), the new reside nce will consist of a series of contiguous, one -story, Balinese -style modules which together will form an aerial \"V\" shape. Additional improvements will include an expansion of the existing gravel driveway (which starts at the entrance off K hi Highway of fset from Hanalei Plantation Road, on the opposite side of the highway), an aerobic effluent treatment system, and a swimming pool with spa (Figure 5 - 7). Scope of Work The purpose of this archaeological investigation is to address any archaeological and/or historical concerns. A Site Plan Approval (KA -17-41) was approved by the Office of Conservation and Coastal Lands (OCCL) on March 13, 2017 for data collection for test trenches and coring for both the archaeological and geological studies. The propos ed work includes methods, background research, previous archaeology in the area, a surface survey, subsurface testing, to meet the requirements of an archaeological inventory -EXPLORATION ASSOCIATES LTD 3 level survey (AIS) per the rules and regulations of (State Historic Preservation Division/Department of Land and Natural Resources) SHPD/DLNR and a finding report with mitigation recommendations. Any property over 50 years of age must be evaluated for historic significance according to the Hawai'i Revised Statues 6E and Hawai'i Adminis trative Rules 13 -13-276 and 284 .

EXPLORATION ASSOCIATES LTD 11 ENVIRONMENTAL SETTING Natural Environment The Hawaiian Archipelago is a 1600 miles long groups of islands, reefs and shoals running northwest - southeast in the Pacific Ocean. The major islands, in the southeast part of the archipelago, \"are basaltic volcanic domes in various stages of dissection\" (Stearns, 1966). The islands have complex geological histories that generally include four stages of volcanism, water and wind, erosion, sea lev el change, catastrophic landslides and accompanying tsunami and subsidence of the crust due to the loads of the volcanoes. The older volcanoes are experiencing rebound of the crust as they erode and the loads gets lighter. The four stages of eruption of an idealized Hawaiian volcano are: pre -shield, shield, post shield and rejuvenated. They are distinguished by lava composition, eruption rate and style, and stage of development. The rejuvenated stage occurs after a few million years of volcanic quiescence. Kaua'i is one of the most structurally complex islands in Hawai'i. It is generally believed to be a single - volcano island, although some isotopic data challenge that interpretation. The strata forming the main mass of the Kauai volcanic complex are assigned to the Waimea Canyon Basalt (Sherrod et. al. 2007). A large caldera (15 -20 km across) was at the top of the shield, and a smaller one (about 3 km long) on the southeastern flank. Both filled with lava flows (MacDonald el. al. 1983) Some of the older r ocks of the island are more than 5.7 million years old (Ma), with the youngest lavas of the shield building stage more than 3 Ma (ibid). After a long period of erosion during which no volcanic activity occurred, rejuvenated stage lava flows, known as the K oloa volcanic series, were emplaced mainly between 2.6 and 0.15 Ma (Sherrod et. al. 2007). Eruptions from a series of vents produced lavas, cinder and tuff cones and ash beds. Just before and during the eruption of the Koloa volcanic series, voluminous landslides and mudflows brought down material from slopes to the lowlands. Part of this material was distributed by streams and buried by the Koloa volcanics (MacDonald et. al. 1960.) The study area is in the ahupua 'a of Hanalei in the traditional district of Halele 'a, the modern judicial district is Hanalei. The project site is located on 14.109 acre parcel in Princeville, Kaua'i, Hawai'i at TMK: 4-5-004: 032 . The site is bordered by Khi Highway (Route 560) on the north, south and west , on the east by the USFWS lands . The proposed project area has been completely cleared . Hanalei Ahupua'a Hanalei Ahupua 'a, encompassing 68.5 sq. kilometers of land and is situated between the latitudes 22o13' north; 22 o 4'30\" south; and longitudes 159 o 27'30\" east and 159 o 31' west. It is bounded to the west by Wai'oli Ahupua 'a and on the east by ahupua'a is a well- defined ridges surro unding the Hanalei River. It extends from sea level in the north at Hanalei Bay to the top of Mt. Wai'ale 'ale (5148 ft.) in the south. Three- quarters of the ahupua'a lies in the Halele'a Forest Reserve. This valley is a typical windward valley bisected by a large perennial stream , Hanalei River , fed by upland tributaries. \"Perhaps 9 km inland, the valley widens somewhat and the EXPLORATION ASSOCIATES LTD 12 stream begins to meander. Here there are considerable alluvial deposits in the bends of the stream\" (Earle 1978:34). Alluvial flood plains are located on both sides of the river. Hanalei River is the fourth largest stream in the State based on the amount of water discharged (Stream Assessment Draft Report of 1990, State of Hawaii and National Park Service: 27). The annual rainfall at Hanalei ranges from 75 in. to as much as 450 in. at the summit of Wai'ale'ale (considered to be one of the world's rainiest spots) (Foote et al. 1972:6). The parcel is mapped on the Geologic Map of the State of Hawai'i (Sherrod et. al. 2007) as lava flows of the Koloa Volcanics: Geological symbol QTkol: rock type pahohoe and 'a'a; age range 0.15 -3.85 Ma. Geological symbols are presented on Figure ---. Geological Units, which are an older nomenclature than the map symbols, and were formalized in the seminal geologic mapping of the Hawaii Divisions of Hydrography; however, the symbols were later adopted to meet national standards. Standard error of the mapping is 100m ( + 50m). The were deeply weathered during t he Late Pleistocene. The project area is roughly \u00bc mile northwest of a vent, known as P'ok, where a large luakini pre-contact historic property is located (State Inventory of Historic Properties [SIHP]# 50 -30-03-139). It was placed on the Hawaii Regist er of Historic Places in 1974 but removed from the Register in 1980 due to land owner notifications. Soils in the project area were mapped by the United States Department of Agricultural (USDA) Soil Conservation Services (SCS), predecessor to the Natural R esources Conservation Service (NRSC), in cooperation with the University of Hawaii (UH) Agricultural Experiment Station (USDA 1972). Soils in the project area are mapped as Makapili Silty Clay soils. Table 1 is a list of major soils types in the project area from (Foote et. al.1972 and USDA NRCS websoil). Figure 8 is the on -line USDA NRCS soil classification map. The Makapili series consists of very deep, well drained soils that formed in material weathered from basic igneous rock and influenced by tropo spheric dust. Makapili soils are on uplands and have slopes of 0 to 40 percent. Elevation ranges from 100 to 350 feet. Most of these soils are in pasture. A small area is in sugarcane and some was formerly used for pineapple. Vegetation of the pasture lan d is dominantly pangolagrass (Digitaria decumbens) and canum) and sensitive plant guava java plu m (Eugenia cumini). About 2% of the land is rough broken land and rough mountainous land. The A horizon has hue of 2.5Y or 10YR, value of 3 or 4 and chroma of 2 or 3. The proposed project site is situated on two soil classifications, with the Makapili Ser ies being the most prominent. Soil found at the proposed project location consists of Makapili silty clay (MeB and MeE), and Rough Mountainous Land (rRT) (USDA SCS 1973). Soils found in the Makapili Series consist of well- drained soils on uplands on the I sland of Kaua`i. These soils developed in material weathered from basic igneous rock. They are nearly level to steep. Elevations range from 100 to 350 feet above mean sea level (msl). MeB and MeE are characterized as follows: MeB (Makapili silty clay, 0 t o 8 percent slopes). MeB is found on broad upland ridges. In a representative profile, the surface layer is brown silty clay about 12 inches thick. The subsoil, EXPLORATION ASSOCIATES LTD 13 about 48 inches thick, is reddish -brown, and yellowish -red clay loam and silty clay that has a sub - angular blocky structure. The substratum is silty clay. Permeability for this soil is moderately rapid. Runoff is slow and the erosion hazard is slight. MeE (Makapili silty clay, 25 to 40 percent slopes). MeE has a soil profile like that of MeB (0 to 8 percent slopes), except that the surface layer is thinner. Runoff is rapid and the erosion hazard is severe. Rough Mountainous Land consists of very steep land broken by numerous intermittent drainage channels. In most places, it is not stony. Elevatio ns range from nearly sea level to more than 6,000 feet msl. Over much of the area the soil mantle is very thin. It ranges from 1 inch to 10 inches in thickness over saprolite. In most places, the saprolite is relatively soft and permeable to roots and wate r. The land surface is dominated by deep, V shaped valleys that have extremely steep side slopes and narrow ridges between the valleys. In most places, the local relief exceeds 500 feet. The soil material on the narrow ridge tops is like that of the Amalu and Oloku`i series. Rock land, rock outcrop, soil slips, and eroded spots make up 20 to 40 percent of the acreage. The slope is presently characterized as having many loose boulders, overhangs, and unstable soil with a high potential for rockfall and lan dslide. Table 1.

The American Heritage Rivers initiative has three objectives: 1) natural resource and en vironmental protection, 2) economic revitalization, and 3) historic and cultural preservation. EXPLORATION ASSOCIATES LTD 16 BACKGROUND RESEARCH There are extensive mythological and oral traditions concerning Hanalei proper, but little about the Princeville area and this parcel. This is a selection of accounts for Hanalei which provides a glimpse of what the Princeville area might have been like during the pre -Contact period here. The following background information is abstracted from Hammatt, Shideler and McMahon (2011). Mythologi cal and Traditional Accounts 'lelo No'eau It seems likely the most proverbial sayings associated with Hanalei are references to the rains. One is simply Ka ua loku o Hanalei (\"The pouring rain of Hanalei\") Hanalei i i ka noe o Alaka'i (\"Heavily weighted is Hanalei in the pouring rain; laden down by the mist of Alaka'i\") (Pukui 1983:170). Pukui explains the poetic meaning: \"An expression used in dirges and chants of woe to express the burden of sadness, the heaviness of grief, and tears pouring freely like rain. Rains and fogs of other localities may also be used.\" Pukui the poetical 'ale nei ka wai. (\"Tear up the birds, the water is surging\") with Hanalei. She explains: Let us h urry, as there is no time for niceties. Kane'alohi and his son lived near the lake of Halulu at Wai'ale'ale, Kaua'i. They were catchers of 'ua'u birds. Someone falsely accused them of poaching on land belonging to the chief of Hanalei, who sent a large com pany of warriors to destroy them. The son noticed agitation in the water of Halulu and cried out a warning to his father, who tore the birds to hasten cooking. Another legend regarding Haehae -ka-manu -a-Kne'alohi -ke-'ale-mai- nei-ka-wai, a peak near Wichman (1998:109) relates the following account: Kne'alohi, a bird catcher, lived in this part of the mountains with his nephew Lauhaka. Their camp was on the cliff side of the Alaka'i Swamp beside an open bit of water. The water of this pool rippled whenever anyone stepped into the swamp miles away. Inadvertently, they were breaking the new rules of Kalknehina, the Waimea chief, who had forbidden the catching of 'ua'u birds, the dark -rumped petrel, which was good eating. Kalknehina sent some warriors to kill the two birdcatchers, but they were warned by the rippling water as they broiled a petrel over the fire. Lauhaka called out to his uncle to tear the bird apart so they could eat it before the warriors reached them - hence the name. A last poetic saying Me'e u'i o Hanalei (\"The handsome hero of Hanalei\") \"said of one who is attractive\") would seem to be a clear reference to Kauahoa (Pukui 1983:234) (reference the Legends of Kawelo below). EXPLORATION ASSOCIATES LTD 17 The Story of Lonoikamakahiki In the Story of Lonoikamakahiki, (Fornander 1919 Vol. IV Part II: 284 the ruling chief Lonokamakahiki and Kaikilani chant similar chants about variou s places in Hawai'i nei including a reference to the rains of Hanalei: O Hanalei kumu a ka ua Hanalei, The source of the rains I amo a haahaa Made low from carrying such a burden Kapaihiahilina also chants of his wanderings at Hanalei with Lonokamakah iki also focusing on the rains: My companion of the tall pandanus...He hoa la, The pandanus that had been pecked by birds, O ka hala i 'aina kepa ia e ka manu, O P'ok i Hanalei -la Thus did we two wander along my companion, Hala ia mao a ka ua, e k e hoa -e Through the heavy and wind -blown rain, He ua ka'e'e, ua makani, The ceaseless and general rain.

EXPLORATION ASSOCIATES LTD 18 Legend of Kaipalaoa In the d of Kaipalaoa, (Fornander 1919 Vol. IV Part III: 576 - 577) the boy hero arrives at Hanalei by sea from Pka' O'ahu in the retinue of the ruling chief of Kaua'i, Pueonuiokona. They meet two canoes of the chief returning with fish and the boy requests some fish. He chooses two relatively small insignificant fish, an Oililepa (file -fish) and a Kikakapu (butterfly -fish) which figure later in his contest of wits at Wailua. Kawelo and Hanalei In the Legend of Kawelo, (Fornander 191 9 Vol. V Part I: 576- 577) the Kaua'i hero was brought up with a certain kinsman, the giant Kauahoa of Hanalei who would become the most noted warrior of the ruling chief 'Aikanaka. In a sidebar, while fishing from a canoe for uhu (parrotfish) at Kaena O'ah u, Kawelo caught the demi -god Uhumakaikai in his net and was towed close to Hanalei where his companion, Maakuakeke, asked for that land. Kawelo returns to Kaua'i to fight against the ruling chief 'Aikanaka and the great warrior Kauahoa. The fighting break s out at Wailua. Aloha for Kauahoa arose within Kawelo and he tries to avoid a fight with his kinsman (hoahanau) from his childhood by trying to win over Kauahoa with a flowery chant, referring to Kauahoa repeatedly as \"the pride of Hanalei\" (ka ui o Hanalei). There are several references to Hanalei: \"swollen and enlarged is the moss of Hanalei\" (Pehu kaha ka limu o Hanalei). \"Hanalei, the cold land, the wet land, the land the end is\" (Hanalei aina anuanu, aina the land of rain\" (O Hanalei aina ua). Kawelo appears to evoke images of the Hanalei landscape: For the anger of Honokoa is reviling, Maewa ana ka ukiukiu o Honokoa At the cliff of Kalehuawehe, I ka pali o Kalehuawehe Where the lama and wiliw ili bloom, Pua ka lama me ka wiliwili Where the rain sweeps on the outside, O ka ua lele ma waho of MamalahoaO Mamalahoa Kauahoa the stalwart meeui o hi s overtures of peace and Kawelo then turned to one of his wives, Kanewahineikiaoha and chants: Say, Kanewahineikiaoha, E Kanewahineikiaoha e; your pikoi (tripping club) throw it up, Ko pakoi hoolei ia i luna At Helelua, at Helelua, I Helelua, i Helelua At the ridge- I kaupoku o Hanalei la. Arise e Hanalei e Until Kauahoa thou hast killed, A make o Kauahoa ia oe, EXPLORATION ASSOCIATES LTD 19 When Hanalei thou shalt possess, Ai ae ia Aahu ae i birds of Kaula thou shalt oe i (Fornander 1919 Vol. V In story of Kawelo (Fornander 1919 Vol. V Part III: 694 -707) Kauahoa is actually the elder brother of Kawelo, born of the same parents, but adopted by Haulili, the \"great one\" of Hanalei (Haulii, ka mea nui o Hanalei). Kauahoa comes from Hanalei and is referred to as \"The champion of Hanalei' (Ke kamaeu o Hanalei). In Pukui's -118, 122) account, following the killing of Kauahoa, Kawelo lived with his wife in Hanalei planting.\" Wichman (1998:111) relates the following: \"Hanalei was the home of Kauahoa, a warrior who lived about 1690. He was the last of the great giant kupua warriors, note d for his strength, size, and because he was handsome. He was born on the same day and in the same place as the future ruling chief, 'Aikanaka, and his cousin Kaweloleimakua. In the war between these two, 'Aikanaka did not immediately call upon Kauahoa, wh o angrily sat in the headwaters of the Hanalei River and dammed up the water for so long that the fish gasped in the dry bottom....Kauahoa is often referred to as Kame'eu'io Hanalei, \"handsome hero of Hanalei,\" and this name was given to a headland in his memory.\" Legend of Palila In the Legend of Palila, (Fornander 1919 Vol. V Part I: 138 -141) there is a reference to a club fighting hero of Hanalei named Lupeakawaiowainiha It was said that every time he urinated the land would be flooded. Legend of Kapunohu In the Legend of Kapunohu, the Kaua'i hero became ruling chief of Kaua'i by throwing his ihe spear from Koloa through the ridge at Anahola leaving a perforation (puka), with it finally slowing as it passed over Kalihikai and falling to earth at Hanalei (Fornander 1919 Vol. V Part I: 224 -225). Legend of Kamapua'a In the Legend of Kamapua'a, the pig child delivers a chant in his anger describing the sea an account of Kamapua'a at Hanalei as follows: EXPLORATION ASSOCIATES LTD 20 \"Courage came back to them [the people of Kaua'i], and at Hanalei the people forced him [Kamapua'a] into a corner, and, carrying stones, tried to fence him in, but he br oke the walls down, tore his way through the people and fled. The high chief of Hanalei threw his magic spear at him as he sushed past, but missed him. The spear struck the mountainside near the summit and passed through, leaving a great hole through which the sky on the other side of the mountain can still be seen.\" Skinner (1900:229) relates the following account of Kamapua'a at Hanalei: \"So ill did he behave in Kaua'i, assailing innocent people and destroying their taro patches, that they determined to dispatch him, and in order to have him under their advantage it was resolved to fence him in near Hanalei. The wall of mountain now existing there is the fence. Just before it was finished the prince in charge of the work sat to rest in a gap which admits the present road. He heard a harsh laugh, and looking up saw Kamapua'a sitting on the top of Hoary Head. A running fight ensued, in which the outlaw escaped across the mountain, and the prince, hurling his spear, but missing his mark, sent the weapon thro ugh the crest of the peak, making the remarkable window that is one of the sights of the island.\" Story of Halali'i In the Story of Halali'i, the king of the ghosts of O'ahu, there was a time when O'ahu was inhabited only by ghosts. The sole Kaua'i s urvivor of an act of treachery by the O'ahu ghosts sails to Hanalei and finds the ruling chief of Kaua'i at that place (Fornander 1919 Vol. V Part II: 432 -433). With the aid of his kahuna, Namalokama he devises a plan to defeat the O'ahu ghosts. Story of the 'helo In the Story of the 'helo, (Fornander 1919 Vol. V Part III: 580 -581) the origin of the 'helo plant is traced to the daughter of a certain Maunakepa: The moss peoples the barren lands Ka limu kaha kanaka of Maunakepao Maunakepa Spatter ing thereon rain Kapekupeku i luna ka ua from Hanalei, etc. O Hanalei, a pela aku. Legend of the lovers Pa'alua and Kawelu In the Legend of the lovers Pa'alua and Kawelu, (Thrum 1923:139) Pa'alua regales the daughter of the ruling chief of O' ahu with accounts of \"the charms of his home in the vale of Hanalei\" referring to the home of his father, the ruling chief of Kaua'i. He makes specific reference to the kamani and olond that grow in the valley me to Hanalei.\" They become the rulers of Kaua'i and Ni'ihau.

Legend of Kalelealuaka In the Legend of Kalelealuaka (Thrum 1907: 84), the hero of that name goes to Hanalei and defeats a resident chief of great strength in a contest of accuracy in throwing spears at a b anana trunk. Account of Kawelu In Knudsen's (1956:83) account of Kawelu, the Shark God, the man -eating demi -god of Wailua is said to also frequent Hanalei River. Village Belle of Poki'i In Knudsen's (1956:93) account of the \"Village Belle of Poki'i\", the beauty is betrothed to a man who lives in Hanalei Valley \"and is very rich, with large taro lands and many horses.\" Ka'awak Pre- contact historic property Regarding Ka'awak Pre-contact historic property at summit of Waiale'ale, Wichman the following account: \"The kilo i'a (fish watcher) of the M would go to Ka'awak at the completion of an 'o'opu fish trap. Here he would make a shrine, present an offering of 'awa, bananas and kumu taro. Then he would make a cup of olon leaves and would chant. This completed the ritual over the fish trap, which he then would close and the fish would be caught.\" The Mo'o Kamo'ookamuliwai Wichman (1998:111) of the river,\" who: \"...was a mo'o that guarded the river crossing. He refused to let Hi'iaka cross the river on her way to H'ena to get Lohi'au for her sister Pele, and sent freshets of water to sweep her off her feet. Hi'iaka struck him dead, and since that time it has not been difficult to cross the river.\" Further legends and myths are provided in the Cultural Impact Assessment (McMah on, 2017 in prep). EXPLORATION ASSOCIATES LTD 22 TRADITIONAL AND HISTORICAL BACKGROUND Pre-Contact and Early Contact Periods The project area is in the ahupua'a of Hanalei, in the present district of Hanalei, in the moku of Halele'a. The land and waters of Hanalei, at 68.5 km2 the largest ahupua'a in the moku of Halele'a, had have long afforded exceptional opportunities for agricultural and cultural development by the Native Hawaiians of Kaua'i in the centuries before Euro -American contact. E.S. Craighill and Elizabeth Handy present the ahupua'a resources that pre -Contact Hawaiians utilized and amplified: \"Hanalei is unique on Kaua'i in having a broad river flowing into a magnificent level seaward area...The flats had been the taro lo'i of the Hawaiians, amply irrigated by d itches from the Hanalei River...\" Because of an abundance of a wide variety of foods, Hanalei was, and still is, one of the most attractive dwelling places in the islands. In addition to the rich lands and water resources, and the beautiful beach, Hanalei was close enough to the rich deep -sea fishing grounds off the Napali coast to supply its people with plenty of fish (Handy and Handy 1972: 420 -21). Elsie H. Wilcox, a descendant of missionaries to Kaua'i, writing in 1917, describes Hawaiian settlement in Hanalei in the early decades of the nineteenth century: \"The settlement then extended along the beach, where the climate was drier and where fishing was available, and the grass -thatched houses were set in the midst of gardens of fruit- trees, vegetables and flowers. Bananas, breadfruit, coffee, sugar- cane, cocoanuts, sweet -potatoes, yams, squashes, pia and taro were cultivated, and chickens and pigs raised. On account of the sandy soil and lack of water \"makai\", most of the taro -patches were further up t he valley, the farmer going up daily to \"mahiai\" and returning at night to his home on the beach. The banks of both rivers were lined with taro -patches which, following the watercourses, extended far up into the valleys. Terraced remains of these patches are still to be seen far above present habitations, their extent indicating a goodly population at that time. The stretch of land between the two rivers, now used as rice -land (i.e. 1917), was then an undrained swamp, not available for cultivation\" (Wilcox 1991:5). The Russian Enterprise at Hanalei The nineteenth century would see the Native Hawaiian landscaped and culture transformed by the interventions of newly -arrived Euro -American missionaries, entrepreneurs, settlers and adventurers. Alexander Baranov, the Russian -American Company's manager at Sitka, chose Georg Anton Sch\u00e4ffer, a German adventurer, to lead a mission to recover the seal skin cargo of the bark the Behring which had run aground at Waimea, Kaua'i. Ka'umuali'i, the king of Kaua'i, took possession of the vessel and its cargo, maintaining that anything brought to Kaua'i became the king's property. Sch\u00e4ffer first arrived on EXPLORATION ASSOCIATES LTD 23 the island of Hawai'i in November of 1815. In May 1816, he sailed for Kaua'i, with an armed crew. Arms, however, were not needed; Sch\u00e4ffer found Ka'umuali'i willing to return the Behring's cargo and eager for an alliance with the Russian Empire. Over the next months a busy Sch\u00e4ffer established the Russian presence on Kaua'i, intending to make the island a launching point for control of the entire Hawaiian chain. After constructing Fort Elizabeth at Waimea Bay, he ordered two earthwork forts at Hanalei: one named after the General Barclay de Tolly, the other named after the Emperor Alexander, constructed on a plateau overl ooking Hanalei Bay on the grounds of the present Princeville Hotel. At the same time, Ka'umuali'i deeded Hanalei to Sch\u00e4ffer who renamed the Hanalei River the \"Don\" (Joesting 1984). By the spring of 1817 Ka'umuali'i had los t confidence in Sch\u00e4ffer, and ordered the Russian emissary and his compatriots to immediately leave the island. The party fled aboard two company ships to Hanalei where Sch\u00e4ffer intended to make a stand. He in his journal: \"I took possession of the island of Kaua'i in the name of His Majesty, the Great Emperor of Russia Alexander Pavlovich, ordered the Russian flag raised on Fort Alexander, fired three canon shots, and declared myself chief of Hanalei Valley\" (in Pierce 1965:202 -203). But Sch\u00e4ffer and the others soon realized their predicament was hopeless. In June 1817, they sailed away from Hanalei Bay and concluded the Russian venture on Kauai. Fort Barclay and Russian Enterprise at the Coast Little is known of the \"lost\" Russian Fort Barclay and other Russian infrastructure constructed at the coast. On November 15, 1816 Sch\u00e4ffer records that \"until now I have worked energetically on Forts Alexander and Barclay.\" Platov, Ka'umuali'i's deputy, a Kaua'i, chief known as Obana Tupigea that Sch\u00e4ffer nam ed after a Russian hero \"...works daily with his Indians on constructions of the fortifications\" (Pierce 1965: 186). On November 25, 1816 Sch\u00e4ffer wrote to Alexander Baranov that \"I now have almost ready here one fortress of stone and two fortifications of earth, with palisades\" referencing Forts Alexander and Barclay at Hanalei (cited in Pierce 1965: 82). On April 1, 1817 Sch\u00e4ffer reported \"I visited the fortifications and found Forts Alexander and Barclay both nearly finished.\" (Pierce 1965:198). Pierce (1965:128) provides the following: \"Sheffer accepted the province of Hanalei and started to build two fortresses there, one [Fort Barclay] on the right side of the river Hanalei at the mouth of the harbor and another [Fort Elizabeth] on the same side of th e river but much higher, at the harbor itself. Both fortresses were built of earth; however both remained unfinished. The work was being done by promyshlenniks [hunter/trappers working for the Russian American Company], with the aid of the in habitants of the province, without any aid from the king.\" Mills (2002:26) comments that: EXPLORATION ASSOCIATES LTD 24 \"These two forts [Fort Alexander and Fort Barclay], built primarily with Russian -American company labor, had low earthen work walls, possibly with palisades.\" In addition to Fo rt Barclay it appears that there was another a \"winery\" present at the coast. Referred to in a letter from George Young (and four other Russians) to Sch\u00e4ffer dated December 29, 1816 Young reported the murder of an Aleut working as a watchman for the Russians and the arson of the \"winery\" at Hanalei: \"The boat with your messenger Fedor Leshchinskii was ready, as was the boat loaded with chalk and clay. Mr. George Young was then on the beach about to send off a letter to you. The natives left their houses an d went somewhere near our buildings, which include a winery, by the lake, with and masses of calabashes. They took two butts of wine and a large quantity of roots used in making alcohol. We, Mr. Young, myself, and Bologov, decided that we needed a watchman so no one, whether an Aleut, a Russian, or a kanaka, would dare to steal or rob [us of] anything. We thought we could avoid trouble that way, but just as we handed the sealed envelope to Leshchinskii, suddenly we heard a gunshot from the guard posted in t he kanaka. We - Captain Young, myself, Bologov, and Leshchinskii - rushed from the room. We found two men from Mr. Young's boat whom we sent to inquire as to the cause of the shooting. We followed them ourselves and started to run along the shore; before w e had covered half of the distance we met the returning men, who told us that the watchman was dead. As soon as we heard that, we saw the building burning on all sides, although there was not one Sandwich Islander to be seen. In ten minutes this unusual fi re was over. The grass was burned out and we could see the dead body. Using water brought from the lake in calabashes, Mr. Young, I and the others put out the rest of the fire. We examined the body of the dead man in the presence of a large crowd. We found the cause of death - a large wound in the chest and two more in... We brought the body to the house...\" (Pierce 1965:83 -84). The geography referred to during this incident is uncertain, but it appears that there was a company house quite close to the mout h of Hanalei Stream and that a different structure, the \"winery, by the lake\" (evidently a thatched structure), was to the north near the present marsh. The assertion that the fire was put out \"using water brought from the lake\" suggests the \"winery\" was c loser to the lake than to either the coast or the Hanalei River. There is no reference to Fort Barclay in the account. The 1820s Into the early 1820s, the Russian episode in Hanalei was apparently forgotten. In 1821 Rev. Hiram Bingham, describing a visit to Hanalei with Ka'umuali'i and King Liholiho, makes no mention of the former Russian presence but gives details of events that repent the on -going Hawaiian culture: \"The people in their original state, treated us with such as they had. One ascended a co ca-nut tree and threw down a nut. Another tore off with his teeth, the thick, fibrous husk, then cracked the shell with a stone, to give us a drink. The head man gave us a course dinner. A pig, baked with heated stones covered in the ground, was set before us on a large, shallow, wooden tray. Kalo, baked in the same manner, and beaten, was laid on large green leaves instead of plates, on the ground...Water was given us in a tumbler EXPLORATION ASSOCIATES LTD 25 consisting of the neck of a gourd -shell, and bananas, ripe, rich, and yellow , were put into our hands singly\" (Bingham 1847:143). In 1824, Bingham witnessed at Hanalei an example of the concerted human effort that could still be evoked by the ali'i. Liholiho's yacht, the Pride of Hawaii ran aground in Hanalei Bay. Bingham proclai med the effort by a great crowd of Hawaiians to salvage the disabled yacht \"one of the best specimens of the physical force of the people, which I ever had opportunity to observe for more than twenty years among them --indeed the most striking which I ever saw made by unaided human muscles\" (Bingham 1847:221). \"The chief Kiaimakani of Waipouli passed up and down through the different ranks, and from place to place, repeatedly sung out with prolonged notes, and trumpet tongue...`be quiet - shut up the voice. ' To which the people responded...`say nothing,' as a continuance of the prohibition to which they were ready to assent when they should come to the tug. Between the trumpet notes, the old chieftain, with the natural tones and inflections, instructed them to grasp the ropes firmly, rise together at the signal, and leaning inland, to look and draw straight forward, without looking backwards toward the vessel. They being thus marshalled and instructed, remained quiet for some minutes, upon their hams\" (Bingha m 1847:221). The salvage efforts ultimately failed and the yacht was lost. The grounding of the Pride of Hawaii at Hanalei Bay would suggest the perils of navigation by western ships attempting to anchor in the bay and along the rest of the northern Kaua' i coast, where wind and sea conditions made it impossible to secure anchorage. During subsequent decades of the nineteenth century, as increasing numbers of traders, ranchers and settlers moved into Hanalei, the bay could serve only as one \"among the many outposts (in the Hawaiian Islands) supplying provisions to the whaling fleet\" (Thomas 1983:23). \"Hanalei was visited by an occasional whaler and by inter- island ships, since there was some cargo to be carried out, but it was a dangerous harbor, especially when winter winds and rain blew down from the north\" (Joesting 1984:141). 1830s to 1850 When the Sulphur , an English vessel on a chart -making voyage, visited Hanalei in 1838, its Captain, Edward Belcher, noted: \"Hanalae [sic], besides beef and vegetab les of the finest quality, furnishes fruits, poultry, turkeys, &c., cheap and in abundance...Our object in coming hither was to embark bullocks, which, we were assured, were better and cheaper than at O'ahu; and we were fully repaid for the trouble; we obt ained noble animals, and meat in England\" (Belcher 1843 Vol.1:61). \"Charltons Farm\", identified on the map of Hanalei drawn after the expedition, overlooked the northeast side of the valley and provided much of these foodstuffs, along with butt er and cheese (Fitzpatrick 1986:68). The British Consul in Honolulu from 1825 to 1846, Richard Charlton, was among the first foreigners to develop new enterprises in Hanalei Valley. EXPLORATION ASSOCIATES LTD 26 In 1831 Charlton leased a stretch of land at Hanalei to be used as a catt le ranch from Kaikio'ewa then Governor of Kaua'i. Its extent was not defined by any boundaries, being generally termed Hanalei. The cattle were allowed to range without absolute limit, except that they were not to encroach on the cultivated lands adjacent. The lease was for twenty years from August 27, 1831 (Wilcox 1991:6 -7). In 1834, the same Governor Kaikio'ewa granted Hanalei land to Joel Deadman for the planting of sugar cane. Deadman's later testimony, recorded in 1844 at the time of the Mhele, reveals the precariousness of the early land ventures at Hanalei and the infor mality of land transactions. Kaikio'ewa \"agreed to cause [the Hanalei land] to be cultivated & planted with sugar cane and [to] find the materials for a mill & and labor.\" In exchange, Kaikio'ewa was to be paid \"one half of the sugar & Molasses produced. \" Deadman \"remained there 6 months at considerable loss & expense and had even work made for the mill\" but the plantation never materialized. In 1842, Deadman would sell the land to Dr. T.C.B. Rooke, father of the future Queen Emma (Joesting, 1984). Durin g the 1830s a successful enterprise in Hanalei was silk making. Charles Titcomb, an American sailor, started a silk plantation that by the early 1840s comprised four varieties of mulberry trees and was reported to have been producing excellent silk (Wilcox 1991:7). The Hanalei silk plantation \"finally encountered financial and other troubles\" and the silk -making enterprise was abandoned in 1844. Titcomb is reported to have lost $15,000 in the venture (Wilcox 1991:183). Also during the 1830s, the Protestant American Board of Commissioners for Foreign Missions (A.B.C.F.M.) established a mission station at Hanalei Bay in the neighboring ahupua'a of Wai'oli. \"The Wai'oli valley seemed the best place on the north shore of Kauai to build a church, school and the necessary domestic buildings which together made up a mission station. Hawaiians there were enthusiastic\" (Riznik 1987:5). In 1834 the first missionary assigned to the Hanalei station was William Patterson Alexander with his wife and son. The Alexanders would remain at Wai'oli until 1843. Beginning in 1831 the missionaries performed a census throughout the Hawaiian Islands. The census provides the first record of the native population after the first decades of western contact. According to the 1834 -35 census of Kaua'i, a total of 1505 Hawaiians - adults and children - were then living in the moku of Halele'a (Schmitt 1973:26). Of that total, 522 Hawaiians, or one -third, resided in Hanalei ahupua'a. During the 1840s, a new agricultural pursuit - coffee g rowing - would transform Hanalei. Charles Titcomb's silk plantation at Koloa had been wiped out in 1840 by a \"drought...bringing in its train insect pests, aphids and spiders\" and by heavy winds, \"trade and kona, whipping off the mulberry leaves\" (Kuykenda ll 1938:183). The Hanalei plantation escaped this disaster but \"finally encountered financial and other troubles\" and the silk -making enterprise was abandoned in 1844. Titcomb is reported to have lost $15,000 in the venture (Kuykendall 1938:183). Despite his losses, Titcomb was able to replant his Hanalei fields with seed procured from Kona. Coffee growing had been introduced to Hanalei in 1842 when John Bernard and Godfrey Rhodes started the Hanalei Coffee Plantation on two pieces of land leased from th e Government \"one on the east side of the Hanalei River containing ninety acres and one on the west side containing sixty acres\" (Wilcox EXPLORATION ASSOCIATES LTD 27 1991:8) with \"plants and seeds...secured from Governor Boki's land Valley [on O'ahu]\" (Wilcox 1991:9). While c offee was already being grown on O'ahu and Hawai'i islands, the fields at Hanalei represented the \"first extensive coffee plantations\" in the Hawaiian Islands (Kuykendall 1938:316). In 1844 the plantations of Titcomb and of Bernard and Rhodes comprised \" upward of 100,000 trees\" (Wilcox 1991:9). By mid -century, coffee dominated the Hanalei landscape: \"a great part of the whole valley, at least to the extent of 1,000 acres, was under cultivation in coffee at this time\" (Wilcox 1991:10). In 1849, six years after his family had left Kaua`i William DeWitt Alexander, son of the former Wai'oli missionary William P. Alexander, describes a return visit to Hanalei. His first view of the valley is of the \"majestic Hanalei River winding its way through coffee plantat ions, & the graceful curve of the bay, bordered with houses, & groves\" (Alexander 1991:125). He later visited the two coffee plantations: \"Capt. Rhodes has a fine coffee plantation. It contains upwards of 100 acres. It is in very fine cultivation. He had also banana, & orange trees, & a very fine grove of bamboo. I was much interested in observing the operation of the coffee mill. As in a sugar mill, a mule turns a perpendicular post. To the top of this is fitted a large horizontal cog wheel. This sets in motion a fly wheel which is connected to the rest of the machinery by bands. There are 3 or 4 mills which perform different stages of the operations. The noise which they made was most deafening\" (Alexander 1991:127 -128). The Titcomb coffee plantation is described as \"flourishing\" though \"not as large as Mr. Rhodes', nor is the coffee as luxuriant\" (Alexander 1991:128). John Bernard, the partner of Godfrey Rhodes, had died at sea off Hanalei Bay in 1845, however, Rhodes and other investors continued the co ffee operation, now renamed the Rhodes & Co. Coffee Plantation. In 1846 the plantation was comprised 750 of the 1000 acres of Hanalei land then under cultivation of coffee (Wilcox 1991:9 -10). Mid -Nineteenth Century: Mahele Documentation A survey by W.A. Wall (1893; R.M. 1833) identifies the locations of all but six of the 66 awarded 'pana in the Land Commission Awards (LCAs) in Hanalei. No Land Commission Awards lie near the project area. A portion of the Wall map shows the locati on of this parcel (Figure 18). Of the 66 claims for Hanalei, only 49 were awarded. In these claims, both awarded and unawarded there are certain land uses claimed by each person, and are designated here as land use components. There are 204 components with percentages of use comprised of 124+ taro patches or mo'o [1 or more taro patches in a mo'o] house lots (21.7%), 18 [ponds) (2.5%) a noni and banana patch, 400 head of c attle and 160 acres of coffee, a wharf (less than 1%). In contrast to other ahupua'a studied, Hanalei has a larger than normal percentage of house lots in proportion to other land uses. For example, in Hanapepe the house lots were 7% of the total compon ents, and in Wailua 14.5%, in Wai'oli 11% while in Hanalei they are 21.7%). This large component of house lots may be explained by 1) the awarding of house lots to ali'i in a favorite dwelling EXPLORATION ASSOCIATES LTD 28 place with a good beach, good fishing and good surfing; 2) awards to warriors who were given house lots here as a reward for loyal service to Kamehameha, especially during the 1824 Kaua'i rebellion and; 3) the practice of having a house in Hanalei while farming in the sister ahupua'a of Wai'oli. The settlement of Hanalei appears to be house lots for the ali'i and for former warriors of Kamehameha II at the shore, with taro patches inland and in the ahupua'a of Wai'oli. Other small concentrations of house lots with nearby gardens are scattered along the north shore , just north of Hanalei River inland along the river. The ahupua'a of Wai'oli would appear to be closely allied to Hanalei and served as a gardening area for some of the claimants residing in Hanalei. Irrigation water originating in Wai'oli crossed the ahupua`a boundary into Hanalei representing one of the few instances in Hawaii of shared water resources between ahupua'a, also suggesting a close community relationship with reciprocal land use and shared water between the two ahupua'a. The majority of house lots are located along the shore. Regarding other claims the Wall map shows a Devereux Hotel near the Land for Emma Rooke. The claim is located on the makai side, bounded by the house of Hawaiiloa where the King and other ali'i stayed when they came to Hanalei. Just inland of this area was Kanoa Pond, and houses are located on the makai and mauka sides of this pond. According to Wall's map close to the shoreline on the north side of the river is the 'ili of Kaunuopua with another smaller concentration of houses and a few lo'i. Kellett, a foreigner, has a lot on the hill just beyond this area for his houses and those of the natives who lived under him, and another lot on the river for his garden of corn and peas. Within a crook of the Hanalei River, in an area called Kaohia is a concentration of lo'i lands with a kula on the inland end. 1850s to 1900 According to records of the Royal Hawaiian Agricultural Society \"for the twelve months from July 1850, to June, 1851...Hanalei exported (to Honolulu) 21,298 pounds of coffee, 39 barrels of Irish potatoes, and 20 head of cattle, at a total value of $2,744.08\" (Damon 1931:334) with coffee agriculture continuing to dominate Hanalei. However, the plantation owners were apprehensive: they foresaw an eventual labor shortage as production increased. They also feared a growing intransigence among the Hawaiian workers. \"Mr. Rhodes stated (in an 1851 report) that laborers were demanding one dollar a day...and that some had refused to work even at four dollars a day\" (Ib id.:351). Many of the Hawaiian laborers had already left the island to work in the gold mines of California. Thus, the Hanalei planters welcomed the plan of the Agricultural Society to import \"Chinese coolie laborers under contracts based on the indentures used in employing seamen\" for the various plantations throughout the Hawaiian Islands (Ibid.:351). In 1852 the first Chinese laborers arrived at Hanalei to work on the coffee plantations. By the next year the Chinese were fully integrated in the labor sys tem; Rhodes' 1853 report on Hanalei to the Agricultural Society noted: \"Mr. Titcomb's Coffee Plantation is in fine order, and he expects a large crop, of perhaps 80 to 100 M. lbs. He has lately cleared more land for planting: his plantation is compact, an d well managed. I believe he is satisfied with his coolies. He has many natives engaged, but has difficulty in making them fulfill their agreements. Our own plantation is thriving, although many years must elapse before it re -attains the EXPLORATION ASSOCIATES LTD 29 prosperous state i t was in 1849 and 1850, when our natives all left us, smitten with the California fever. I am very well satisfied with the coolies, and much prefer them as laborers\" (in Damon 1931:352 -353). Whatever comfort the coffee planters of Hanalei may have obtaine d from the new labor force, in the 1850s they became vulnerable to natural forces beyond their control. That vulnerability had been foreshadowed earlier, in 1847, when a torrential rain flooded the valley, severely damaging the coffee trees. In 1851 and 18 52 the Hawaiian Islands suffered through a severe drought and a subsequent blight ravaged coffee trees at Hanalei and on all the islands. The plantations could continue producing for a few more years but by the end of the 1850s, the Hanalei plantations were devastated. A visitor in 1860 contrasted the current despoliation with the flourishing scene of three years earlier: \"The coffee blight has entirely covered the two Hanalei plantations which in the spring of 1857 we saw in full and successful culture, yielding 200,000 pounds of excellent coffee. It was sad to witness the contrast. Then scores of women and children were busy picking the ripe berries, and depositing their gatherings at night at the overseer's office, but now all was silent. Not a gatherer was abroad, and we saw laborers bringing in coffee trees upon their shoulders, to heat the fires under the sugar boilers of Mr. Titcomb\" (in Damon 1931:351). The \"sugar boilers of Mr. Titcomb\" the visitor noted were evidence of an unflagging resilience; for Titcomb, during the latter 1850s, had converted his fields from silk to coffee turning his energies to sugar growing. Godfrey Rhodes, the other Hanalei coffee grower, had already sold his coffee plantation. On March 14, 1853, the Rhodes Coffee Planta tion land was bought from the Government for $1,300 however on Sept. 13, 1855 Rhodes sold out his interest in the plantation for $8,000 (Wilcox 1991:13). The man who purchased the land and plantation was Robert Crichton Wyllie, the Hawaiian Kingdom's Minis ter of Foreign Affairs. Wyllie, a Scotsman who had made his fortune as a merchant in South America, arrived in the Hawaiian Islands in 1844. Wyllie had not intended to settle in Hawai'i, but in 1845 he accepted an appointment by King Kamehameha III as Min ister of Foreign Affairs. He served in that office until his death twenty years later. As Foreign Minister, Wyllie's great ambition was the recognition of the Hawaiian Kingdom as a sovereign nation by the world's powers. But a more personal aspiration also captivated Wyllie: to build for himself a manor at Hanalei quite as magnificent as any he had known in Scotland. So, in 1853 he began acquiring tracts of Hanalei land beginning with the Rhodes Coffee Plantation. Wyllie attempted to save the coffee plantation: \"For ten years (Wyllie) doggedly fought against [the] blight which gradually withered the trees. Finally facing reality, he pulled out the dead trees and planted a new crop, sugar\" (Hackler 1982:66). By 1862, Wyllie had \"constructed an extensive sugar factory and other infrastructure, along the river, at the eastern end of the valley, importing much of the machinery from Scotland\" (Thousand Friends...1987:32) and in 1863 he bought Titcomb's lands, just one piece of the extensive land purchases Wyllie made during the early 1860s: EXPLORATION ASSOCIATES LTD 30 \"On Feb. 5, 1863, Mr. Titcomb sold out to Mr. Wyllie...In all, four pieces of land passed to Wyllie, 750 acres at Emmasville, 1 acre at the landing, Kanoa Pond, 10 and Kukia on the opposite side of the river. Wyllie had befor e this, on April 17, 1862, bought the Ahupuaa of Kalihikai, this being the property of A. Keliiahonui, grandfather of Levi Halele'a, given to Keliiahonui by an old ali'i. On Oct. 5, 1862, Wyllie bought at public auction from J.W. Austin and Chas. ( (Wilcox 1991:14). Wyllie's land purchases and substantial investment in the development of his sugar operation reflected a brilliant future he envisioned for his estate. He intended to name as heir to his lands the young \"Prince of Hawaii\" (Ka Haku o Hawaii) Albert Edward Kauikeaouli Leiopapa a Kamehameha, who had been born in 1858, to King Kamehameha IV and Queen Emma. In 1860 after a visit by the royal family to Hanalei. Wyllie named the estate \"Princ eville\". He resolved to petition the king to proclaim the estate the \"Barony of Princeville\" - making it a fit legacy for the prince - but in 1862 his plans were undone when Albert died at the age of four. Wyllie died three years later. The estate and plan tation were now deeply in debt and in 1867 Wyllie's lands were auctioned for $40,051.50 to Elisha Hunt Allen who, like Wyllie, was an official of the Hawaiian government. The Princeville Plantation continued to operate under changing ownership until the 1 890s. In 1872 \"the average crop was 400 tons, capacity of the mill, 1,000 tons (Wilcox 1991:18). At the height of sugar cane production, approximately 4,870 acres were planted in cane. Overall production was sub -marginal due to poor soils and less than ide al climatic conditions. By the last decade of the nineteenth century, the difficulties of growing sugar cane at Hanalei were insurmountable: \"...the cane had never done well in that cool, wet climate. Much of it rotted in the lower fields; the upper field s were, it is said, not plowed deeply enough and at times there was not water enough to flume the cane down to the mill\" (Wilcox 1991:18 -19). The company failed and the last crop was harvested in 1893. By 1899, Albert S. Wilcox had secured control of all the plantation: \"The lower lands were rented out to Chinese rice- planters, and the upper lands between Hanalei and Kalihiwai were planted to imported grasses and turned into a cattle -ranch\" (Wilcox 1991:19). In 1916 Wilcox sold the land to Lihue Plantation Company and W.F. Sanborn (Wilcox 1991:19). Where William Alexander half a century earlier had viewed the Hanalei Valley dominated by coffee plantations, a visitor in the 1890s would come upon an entirely transformed landscape. Eric A. Knudsen, recounting a trip around Kauai in 1895, presents the view of Hanalei as his party approached from Kalihiwai Ahupua'a: \"We...were glad when we reached the great valley of Hanalei. The road in those early days almost dived straight down to the bridge. It was steep an d in wet weather very slippery...About half way down, the valley began to open up. Rice fields and taro patches covered the flat bottom lands as far as the eye could see...the view to our right, the winding river with a barge loaded with rice slowly drifting down on its placid surface, and beyond the great sweep of sandy beach, were a truly inspiring sight\" (Knudsen 1991:153). EXPLORATION ASSOCIATES LTD 31 Knudsen's account reveals significant features of the Hanalei landscape during the last years of the nineteenth century. The bridge that now spans the Hanalei River on the government road is a recent development. As noted in a tourist guide, until the 1880s there was no bridge over the river. There was \"ferry opposite the Princeville Plantation, where passengers, cattle, teams, etc., can pass the river free of charge, the ferry being supported by the Government and the Princeville Plantation, jointly\" (Thousand Friends...1987:58 -59). The rice fields of the 1890s expanded through the previous decades as sugar declined. Upon completion of their contracts with the plantation, many the immigrant Chinese laborers remained in Hanalei, many becoming merchants or rice farmers, the existing taro lo'i providing a ready foundation for conversion to rice paddies. A market for rice in California had developed in the mid -nineteenth century and Chinese immigration to the islands also provided a domestic market. The Princeville Plantation Company began leasing out their land for rice farming in the 1870s. The plantation ended up leasing 300 acres to Chulan and Company at $20 per acre, per year (Hackler 1982:80). By 1892, 750 acres of Hanalei Valley were under rice cultivation, comprising the largest single rice -producing locality in the Hawaiian Islands (Thousand Friends...1987:116). Maps of the 1890s show six rice mills in the valley. The transformation of Hanalei Valley from sugar to rice during the second half of the nineteenth century reflected an increasing Chinese population at Hanalei. Government census at Hanalei recorded 164 Chinese in 1866, 132 in 1872, 265 in 1878, 459 in 1884, and 689 in 1896 (Ibid.:116). Government census also documented the declining Native Hawaiian population of Hanalei during the second half of the nineteenth century: there were 1926 Hawaiians in 1853, 1600 in 1860, 1949 in 1866, 1403 in 1872, 578 in 1878, 795 in 1884, 860 in 1890, and 679 in 1896 (in Ibid.:121). Presumably some of the Hawaiians in the 1890s continued to farm the remaining taro lo'i that Eric Knudsen noticed amidst the rice fields in 1895. In the late n ineteenth century, land use and demographic were changing throughout Kaua'i. According to Joesting (1984: 249- 250): \"By the 1890, there were villages and hotels where once there had been no inhabitants at all, a reflection of how the centers of population s were shifting. The places that had offered the most to Hawaiians - the sea to fish in, a stream to provide water for taro these things became less important as the new commercial world took increasing control. Although some Hawaiians preferred the old life -style, many moved close to the plantation hub with the nearby company store, and their generally thinning numbers reduced old villages to fragments of what they once had been... Places like Anahola Valley, Moloaa, Kalihiwai and Waipouli had previously bee n centers of population\". EXPLORATION ASSOCIATES LTD 32 1900 to the Present During the first decade of the twentieth century, rice -farming by the Chinese continued to be the focus of large -scale economic activity in Hanalei. In 1912 two extant historically significant structures w ere constructed at Hanalei: the pier at the mouth of Hanalei River and the bridge spanning the river. The pier is described, in an application for placement on the National Register of Historic Places, as a \"wooden deck...built during a period of economic prosperity in the area, primarily the result of a thriving rice industry\" which \"replaced an earlier shorter pier and primarily was employed for the shipment of rice.\" While the new pier reflected the flourishing rice -based economy of the valley, the cons truction of the steel bridge replacing the wood bridge Eric Knudsen had crossed in 1895 provided an impetus to further change in Hanalei. An application for placement on the National Register of Historic Places, notes that the construction of such a substa ntial steel bridge \"helped stimulate the economic and social growth of the then relatively isolated North Shore\" of Kaua'i. Facilitated access in and out of the valley accelerated development begun in the late 19th including the building of vacation house s along the Hanalei beach that take advantage of the pleasant breezes and spectacular water views. A 1916 article in the \"Garden Island\" characterized Hanalei's attractions by the second decade of the twentieth century: \"Hanalei has been a popular and po pulous community of late, a sort of suburb of Lihue since there were many Lihue people summering there, the various beach houses being full to overflowing. Morning, noon, and night the wharf has been alive with enthusiastic but \"green\" fishermen, mostly of a tender age, and the sands dappled with figures in proper costume and the waters flecked with tumbling swimmers who mostly couldn't swim\" (Thousand Friends...1987:63). This clearly foreshadowed the future development of Hanalei and Princeville as a reso rt destination. After the first decades of the twentieth century, rice farming declined sharply throughout the Hawaiian Islands as lower- priced rice grown in California inundated the market. Chinese rice planters at Hanalei and elsewhere began selling the ir fields to immigrant Japanese rice growers. In 1916, 16% of the rice lands in the then Territory of Hawai'i were controlled by Japanese growers. By 1932, a survey indicated that 62% of Hawaii- grown rice was being cultivated by Japanese. At first the Japanese sold their paddy to Chinese owned rice mills; then, gradually, they took over the mills (Glick 1980:59). As increasing numbers of Japanese moved into Hanalei to own and work the rice fields, the original Chinese rice -growers moved to other commercial pursuits. For example, the Haraguchi family began leasing rice land at Hanalei from the Man Sing family and in 1924 subsequently purchased the Man Sing mill. The family cultivated 75 acres in the valley. When the original Man Sing mill was destroyed by fire in 1930, the Haraguchi family built the still extant mill that is presently listed on the National Register of Historic Places. The documentation for the mill's placement on the Register notes that the Japanese rice growers replaced the Chinese variety of rice with shorter grain rice that the Japanese preferred. EXPLORATION ASSOCIATES LTD 33 In the 1930s, the Agricultural Extension Service of the University of Hawaii began a program to increase rice production at Hanalei, resulting in a brief \"resurgence in rice cultivation\"; acreag e in Hanalei increased from \"759 in 1933 to 1058 in 1934,\" and by 1936 Hanalei \"produced over two -thirds of all rice in Hawaii, almost all of it for consumption within the Territory\" (Thousand Friends...1987:117 -118). It is this rice -dominated Hanalei land scape that E.S. Craighill Handy, in his 1940 study of planting areas throughout the Hawaiian Islands. Handy describes the valley as it appeared in the 1930s. Handy's account is especially valuable as he notes both 20th century usages based on his field ob servations, and former usages based on information from native informants: \"The swampy land below the hills at the west end of Hanalei next to Wai'oli is unused. The land between the highway and the bay on the west side of the river, much of which used to be terraces, is now given over to pasture and home sites. The land named Paele in the great bend of the river east of the bay, which used to be in rice or taro, is now used for pasture. The broad area inland from the river, named Kahanawai, is now planted with rice, except for the flats adjoining the base of the hill. According to Sheriff Lota, this area was only partly developed in terraces in ancient times. In the 1880's, the land just above the highway was planted in sugar cane, which gradually extended far up Hanalei Valley. Subsequently much of this land, which had not previously been in terraces, was cut up by the Chinese into paddy fields. It was only in the flats of Hanalei Valley proper that terraces were continuous in the old days. At present, ric e paddies are continuous for 1.3 miles from the highway bridge where the Hanalei River turns east; another sizable rice patch lies four tenths of a mile beyond, the land between being neglected. Beyond this farthest rice plantation, the Hawaiian homesteads commence. A few Hawaiians and other homesteaders plant a little taro for home consumption. It is said that there are numerous areas of abandoned small terraces farther in the interior\" (Handy 1940:72). Handy's description suggests that by the 1930s, Hana lei Valley comprised a patchwork of shifting fallow and active agricultural fields and pastures reflecting the vagaries of decades of shifting economic pressures. While Handy asserts that taro farming survived in the 1930s only as a subsistence crop for a \"few Hawaiians and other homesteaders\" other sources suggest that the taro -growing area at Hanalei was more expansive. In 1939 a U.S. Department of Commerce agricultural census recorded 108 acres in taro at Hanalei, comprising fully one -fifth of the total 529 acres in taro throughout Hawai'i (Thousand Friends...1987:118). In the 1950s and 1960s as Japanese farmers phased out rice production, to taro lo'i. By the late 1980s, taro -growing, which once dominated the traditional Hawaiian landscape, was firmly re -established within Hanalei. Beginning in the 1960s, the Princeville area began its evolution into a major resort and condominium complex. Development presently continues. At the same time: \"...the Federal government became a partner in shaping land us e in the Hanalei Valley...by working with the Princeville Development Corporation to acquire land for the U.S. Fish and EXPLORATION ASSOCIATES LTD 34 Wildlife water bird refuge. The refuge has a supportive policy of continued taro production and the maintenance of the irrigation system and existing houses and farm outbuildings\" (Thousand Friends...1987:10). Established in 1972 the Hanalei National Wildlife Refuge provides feeding and nesting areas for endangered Hawaiian water birds including the coot, stilt, gallinule and duck. It enc ompasses 917 acres of Hanalei Valley, including 70 acres of ponds, 600 acres of forest and mountain areas, and as of 1993, 125 acres of commercial taro fields. In 1982 Hurricanes Iwa and in 1992 Iniki demonstrated the precariousness of human development w ithin the Hanalei environment, just as natural disasters thwarted the efforts of newly -arrived nineteenth century entrepreneurs. However, the endurance and flourishing of taro through the changes documented above today may preserve the memory of pre -Contac t Hanalei. EXPLORATION ASSOCIATES LTD 35 LAND USE PATTERN S IN PROJECT AREA AND VICINITY The project area is located within the Hanalei Ahupua'a, however Hanalei's topography correlates with post -Contact land use patterns of Kalihikai and Kalihiwai ahupua'a. The project area locat ion on the eastern bluff above the river valley, sets it apart from the irrigated lowlands, associated with the agricultural pursuits of both pre - and post -Contact periods. Numerous accounts in the early nineteenth century attest to extensive pandanus grov es in the 1890). William DeWitt Alexander (1991:124) describes these groves during a trip around the island in 1849, \"Five more miles of riding through woods of hala, brought us to the tip of the hill that overlooks Hanalei Valley...\". In 1865 William T. Brigham visited Kaua'i and also commented on the extensive pandanus. \"Vast numbers of pandanus cover the hillsides and grow so luxuriantly as to furnish an admirable shelter from the rain\" (Lydgate 1991:139). Prior to western contact, this area was likely used for gathering as part of the Hanalei Ahupua'a land open to all ahupua'a members. Economically viable plants have been identified in association with archaeological remains on the lower slopes at the 25 to 125 -ft elevation on the valley ridge just below the project area (see Previous Archaeology Section). These have been associated with dry land or kula lands to supplement crops growing in the lower adjoining terr aces (Cleghorn, 1979; Schilt, 1980). Residents would not have to travel to far mauka to find the hala needed for their mats, and other woven products. The first recorded use of the uplands of Hanalei, Kalihikai and Kalihiwai by a non -Hawaiian was in 1831. The British Consul of the Sandwich Islands, Richard Charlton, was awarded the use of land to feed his livestock at \"Hanalei\", Kaua'i by the Governor of Kaua'i, Kaikio'ewa (Wilcox 1991). This agreement set a precedent for all historic land use thereafter in this area in that ahupua'a boundaries were not recognized. In the agreement, no boundaries were specified and apparently there was no limit to the range of the cattle. The only other stipulation than the conditions of exchange was that the cattle be kept from cultivated lands. Wilcox (1991:7) describes the cattle ranging over the slopes between Hanalei and Kalihiwai. The Charlton Farm was located approximately one -kilometer northwest of the project area. This plateau land would be a favorable place to hav e the cattle as the topography is uniform, descending gradually mauka- makai and the uplands are generally removed from the cultivated lands found in gulches and alluvial lands associated with more abundant water resources at lower elevations. Besides failing to fulfill his contract with Kaikio'ewa, Charlton also failed to keep the livestock from encroaching upon cultivated lands. Earle (1978:149) reports on the mid nineteenth century \"decline of kula farming due to the destruction of gardens by newly introd uced cattle\" in the region. In 1845 Captain Jules Dudoit the French consul of the Sandwich Islands, purchased the lease of the Hanalei uplands from Charlton and continued the cattle operation upon the same Hanalei- Kalihikai- Kalihiwai uplands (Damon 1931). The sale of cattle and salt beef to Honolulu and to whale ships was supplemented with the production of milk. A visitor in 1850 commented on the \"1800 head of fine cattle\" on Mr. Dudoit's estate (Damon 1931:335). This was a tremendous growth over the 100 head of cattle EXPLORATION ASSOCIATES LTD 36 estimated in 1840 and is a logical explanation for the destruction of kula lands reported above, and native landscape in general. In 1851 at the termination of the lease in 1851, the Dudoit's moved to the Ko'olau District. It is uncertain whether cattle ranching continued in the uplands of Hanalei, Kalihikai and Kalihiwai. There is some mention of sheep in Hanalei although their grazing lands are not identified (Damon 1931). In 1853, subsequently Wyllie, the Minister of Foreign Affairs, beg an acquiring lands in the Hanalei Valley. He began in 1853 by purchasing the same portion of Hanalei that Charlton had leased. By the time he had acquired the ahupua'a of Kalihikai and Kalihiwai in 1862 and consolidated his lands into the Princeville Plant ation, sugar cane cultivation had become his primary agricultural pursuit. Although no sugar cane cultivation was recorded in the project area during William Brigham's 1865 visit to Kaua'i, Brigham did make mention of the pandanus and the grasslands of the Hanalei uplands (Lydgate 1991). The earliest record of sugar cane cultivation occurring in the uplands appears on a map of Hanalei from 1885. By the end of the nineteenth century cane cultivation in the uplands was abandoned (Wilcox, 1991). The upland s were converted back to pasturelands after the new owner, Albert S. Wilcox purchased the Princeville Plantation in 1899 (Wilcox, 1991: 19). Lands of the Princeville Plantation were sold again in 1916, this time to the Lihue Plantation (Damon 1931). Lihue Plantation was more interested in the water rights than producing sugar: \"The main object, however, was less the lands than the very valuable water rights which accompany them and to which seven miles of open ditches and tunneling under the mountains have given free access. This taps the upper sources of the Hanalei River, the largest stream on any of the islands, and was not begun until 1923\" (Damon 1931:918). The cattle ranch operated by Wilcox was maintained by Lihue Plantation until 1969 when Princevil le was sold to Consolidated Oil and Gas Corporation of Colorado. In the 1970s 900 acres of the Princeville Plantation lands on the Hanalei Valley floor were purchased by the Federal Government with the intention of creating a National Wildlife Refuge. T he remainder of the Princeville Plantation on the uplands was converted into a resort -residential community with hotels, condominiums, restaurants and golf courses. EXPLORATION ASSOCIATES LTD 37 PREVIOUS ARCHAEOLOGICAL RESEARCH Previous Archaeological Studies in the General Vicinity The following is a summary of archaeological studies in the general vicinity. Most the previous archaeological work has been conducted in the Hanalei Town area, Hanalei Wildlife Refuge, Princeville lands in general and P'ok Pre-contact historic property area. No previous archaeological studies have been conducted in the project area. These studies are summarized in Table 2 and particularly germane studies are discussed in greater detail below. Figure 9 shows a map of the archaeological surveys near the project area which relates to Table 2 listing of studies. Bennett (1931) The first co mprehensive study of the archaeology of Kaua'i was undertaken by Wendell C. Bennett (1931) based on field work accomplished in 1928 and 1929. Bennett recorded four historic properties in Hanalei Ahupua'a and two in Kalihikai Maheu, Kalihikai, is a paved platform 18 by 21 feet on top of Maheu peak. There is a fine view of the valley and country all around. River stone as well as local rock is used in its paving. Site 139: P'ok Pre-contact h istoric property , on the east bluff of Hanalei valley a short distance from the government road on a knoll marked on the map as \"Pooku.\"Only a few stones remain to mark the location of this pre-contact historic property which Thrum [1906:43] describes as \"An unenclosed pre -contact historic property of about two acres in area. Of luakini class, terraced down on all sides from the central platform.\" Site 140: Kapaka Pre-contact historic property , on top of Kapaka hill on the east bluff of Hanalei valley just within the forest line. Thrum describes this structure as \"A paved open platform pre - contact historic property without walls; stones set edgewise traversing through. Kane its deity. Said to have had connection with Kapinao at Waiakalua in its workings.\" T his site has had many stones removed, or covered over with vegetation. The river stones seem to cover the top of the hill for a diameter of about 75 feet. The extent of the pre-contact historic property could not be accurately determined. The stones set ed gewise traversing through could not be found. Site 141: Pre -contact historic property and house sites, at Kalama- iki, an old village on the river flats, four miles up Hanalei Valley. There is a stone structure 18 by 20 feet with walls all around 2.5 feet wide and 2 feet high. In front is a paved section extending 5 feet, like a lanai, to a drop of 4 feet to the river terrace. The river is 50 feet out in front. Both river stones and rough rocks were used, but no coral was seen. The wall was chinked with sma ller stones in front. Taro terraces and house sites are on the plains along the river. EXPLORATION ASSOCIATES LTD 38 Site 142: Kaapoku Pre -contact historic property , inland from Site 141 in Hanalei Valley. This small shrine consists of an 18 by 20 foot platform made of rough stones. A village was across the stream. Site 143: Ditch and house sites, across the river from Site 142 in Hanalei Valley. Site also includes taro terraces and a ditch that runs from 0.5 mile or so up the stream to water this plain. The water comes through a big rock which is conveniently cracked. The legend reads that Pele sent lightning to split the rock so that the people could get the water down to the fields. Upstream from here a large, overhanging rock forms a natural shelter. It has been built up along the front a bit. The house sites of the solidly paved type, as well as those merely outlined with stones, are found (Bennett 1931:134 -35). Table 2.

Previous archaeological studies lo cated near the project area. (Adapted from Yucha and Hammatt 2009) EXPLORATION ASSOCIATES LTD 42 The general location of Bennett sites 138 to 143 is shown in Figure 10. Figure 10. Bennett's Archaeology of Kaua'i Site Map showing the general location of hi storic properties Cleghorn (1979) Cleghorn (1979) conducted an archaeological reconnaissance survey of 620 acres of Princeville Corporation property in the Hanalei and Kalihikai ahupua'a, including the vicinity of the current project area (see Figure 7 below). A single site recorded approximately 500 meters north of the present project area, encountered consisted of an upright boulder and a semicircular area excavated into a ridge slope directly above 'Anini Gulch. Thousand Friends (1987) In the mid 1980's, the Land and Community Associates contracted to undertake a \"cultural landscape survey\" of Hanalei Ahupua'a. The study, which included fieldwork, historical background research, and oral histories, included documentation of \"396 separate taro terraces, 81 historic structures and 3 major irrigation systems\" (Thousand Friends...1987:12) Kikuchi (1988a, 1988b) In 1988, Kikuchi performed field inspections of two proposed projects situated adjacent to the north boundary of the project area (Kikuchi 1988 a, 1988b). The first was for the proposed Princeville Corporation's Nursery Staging and Light Equipment Storage Area located at TMK 5 -3-01:16 Lot 27 on level land north and west of P'ok. Kikuchi reports: EXPLORATION ASSOCIATES LTD 43 \"The area adjacent to the hillock on which P'ok Pre-contact historic property sit[s] is composed of sloping grassy lands. No features of any kind were recorded. The soil stratigraphy was inspected in several areas where the ground had been excavated for laying out of pipes. Besides a thin upper layer o f humus the remaining soil consisted of clayey brown soil devoid of rocks. Similarly, geological coring in the Pu'u Poa ridge indicated a very thick stratum of residual clayey soils resulting from the decomposition of the localized basaltic lava flows. Exp osures in the landscape of the intended Nursery area showed nothing of cultural significance.\" Surface and subsurface inspection of TMK 5 -3-01:16 Lot 27 revealed no historic properties. If there had been any prehistoric or historic features and historic p roperties present in the area, these were cleared long ago. (Kikuchi 1988a:1). The second inspection was carried out for the proposed development of the Church of the Pacific property, seemingly a subset of the area studied by Kikuchi (1988a). Kikuchi rep orts: \"As in the Nursery area inspection, no historic properties were visible on the surface, and the many trenches for plumbing revealed no subsurface cultural features.\" The topography here has been extensively leveled, as evidenced by the lack of a well- developed humus layer. This soil was not noted anywhere in the trenches. Only the lower B -horizon soils existed at the surface. Weathering of the landscape was not responsible in eliminating all the natural rock outcrops, suggesting that this is likely the result of grading or other historic landform changes, or geological processes of eroding colluvium from higher elevations covering the surface with soil. In summary, no historic properties on the surface or any subsurface cultural features were noted in the area (Kikuchi 1988b:1). Quebral and Cleghorn (1990) P'ok Pre-contact historic property was surveyed again in 1990 in conjunction with the proposed Khi Highway Improvements Project (Quebral and Cleghorn, 1990). In addition, the study addressed other portions of land in TMK 5 -03-06: 14, with an assessment of the historical significance of four drainage tunnels associated with the proposed corridor. The drainage tunnels were mapped and no archaeological surface features were identified in the realignment corridor and associated lands. The proposed realignme nt was determined to have no impact on P'ok Pre-contact historic property . McMahon (1993) In 1993, McMahon conducted an archaeological field inspection of P'ok Pre-contact historic property to address the adverse impacts of Princeville Corporati on's nursery operation on the pre-contact historic property . McMahon determined that the nursery had impacted the pre -contact historic property . EXPLORATION ASSOCIATES LTD 44 \"In addition to the nursery impacting the pre-contact historic property , there are other intrusions. The trig station has been placed directly on the pre -contact historic property proper. Kapaka Road has also impacted the terraces on the east and south sides. Several vehicle tracks can also be seen with the pre - contact historic property and its buffer\" (McMahon 19 93:6). Hammatt et al. (2000) In 2000, Cultural Surveys Hawai'i (Hammatt et al. 2000) conducted an archaeological inventory survey of a 5-acre area proposed for the Hanalei Valley scenic overlook. There were no significant finds. Hammatt et. al (2011 ) Cultural Surveys Hawai'i, Inc. and Nancy McMahon, EAL, archaeologist, conducted an archaeological inventory survey (AIS) of the Kapaka Ridge Agricultural Condominium Project in Hanalei. The 174 -acre project parcel, referred to as \"Lot 27\", extends al ong the northeast rim of Hanalei Valley for almost three miles and is bordered on the south by Khi Highway and on the west by Kapaka Street. The AIS survey area was limited to approximately 58 acres of the parcel. The survey area included: (i) the port ion of the lot zoned for agriculture in which farm dwellings and agricultural activity are permissible (under HAR Chapter 15 -5-24 and the CPR declaration); (ii) the portion of the lot in the conservation district in which a single dwelling may be construct ed (under the CPR declaration and subject to approval by the DLNR); and (iii) all of the remaining level land area in the conservation district between Kapaka Street and the Hanalei Valley rim that is pedestrian accessible. The remainder of the parcel (app roximately 116 acres) was not surveyed except for a limited pedestrian inspection south and west of the AIS survey area due to dense foliage and/or steep slopes. The parcel's built environment consists of Kapaka Street, numerous single family dwellings e ast of Kapaka Street on adjacent parcels, a commercial nursery with several large buildings and sheds, a 60 -foot high cellular phone tower on the property, a U.S. Geological Survey triangulatio n station at P'ok Pre-contact historic property , a Princeville Utilities pumping station on the property, the Khi Highway, the major transportation artery serving the north shore of Kaua'i, a jeep road on the property along the rim of the valley, and v arious related infrastructure. Only two significant historic properties were identified during the AIS, SIHP# 50 -30-03-0139 (P'ok Pre- contact historic property ) and SIHP# 50 -30-03-2129 (an unimproved road remnant). Hammatt et. al. (2012) This is a Preservation Plan prepared by Cultural Surveys Hawaii and Nancy McMahon, EAL for SIHP# 50 - 30-03-0139 (P'ok Pre-contact historic property ) as recommended in the AIS (Hammatt et. al. 2010). This plan includes details of the short and long -term preservation measures that will safeguard the historic property during project construction and subsequent use of the project parcel, per the requirements of HAR Chapter 13 -277-3. EXPLORATION ASSOCIATES LTD 45 McMahon and Tolleson (2013) In 2013, an archaeological inventory survey was conducted o n 19.10 acres of partially, across Khi Highway, on Princeville Corp. lands for 44 units for the Kolopua Affordable Housing project. No historic properties were found which turn the inventory into an assessment. Subsurface testing in this location showed similar characteristics as this project. Soils consist of two layers, with a flat boundary delineating the topsoil from the underlying deposit. METHODS Field Methods Much of the property is too steep to nearly vertical cliff to access safely traversing of this area creates a risk to vehicular traffic on the lower portion of the Khi Highway loop from dislodged rocks). On October 21, 2016, archaeologist Nancy McMahon, principle archaeologist for Exploration Associates, Ltd. performed a pedestrian survey utilizing transects oriented north -south and spaced 5 m. apart. Surface survey continued with Linz Armstrong on April 24, 2017. The next day, subsurface survey consisting of the excavation of 6 trenches in the proposed building locations and one which was also still in the building location footing but in the area where presumed mounds once existed that were believed to be possible burial mounds, to examine the soils and determine stratigraphic sequences and record buried cultural deposits. Subsurface testi ng was conducted using a small backhoe. Field observations were recorded and photographs were taken of the project area and the trenches. Trenches were measured and trench profiles were photographed. Soil identification, color and chroma was obtained usin g a Munsell color chart. Document Review Background research included a review of the files at SHPD/DLNR Kaua'i and the County of Kaua'i, Planning Department. The County of Kaua'i, approved an SMA minor for the installation of a gate and a rock wall at th e entrance to the parcel on April 20, 2015. The County of Kaua'i Water Department approved the installation of a water meter, during the review process for the water meter, SHPD archaeologist Mary Jane Naone, recommended an archaeological inventory survey and requested a site inspection. The SMA permit was amended to include the AIS recommendation. The County Planning staff believed that an AIS was conducted or the SHPD did their site own inspection and approved the gate/rock wall and water meter installa tion. No such report was found in the SHPD files. During a project for the State of Hawaii Department of Transportation, Khi Highways had slope stabilization conducted. EarthTech and AECOM did the EA and CDUA for HDOT for slope stabilization. The auth or of this report did review this project in 2008 as the former SHPD Deputy Administrator and State Archaeologis t but this is not the entire land of for this current project . The initial review of the proposed action was initiated a determination from the SHPD dated February 24, 2008 that \"no historic properties will be affected\". However, SHPD review comments on the Draft EA dated August 31, 2008 recommended an archaeological inventory survey be conducted in the project area for the stabilization not th e whole parcel which PCSI was hired and found no historic properties in the slope stabilization area. This report was not found in the SHPD/DLNR library on Kaua 'i. There were concerns EXPLORATION ASSOCIATES LTD 46 about the stabilization project from the community as they are believed the ridge that this parcel is on has a few natural springs, the ridge is called Kaunuhua Ridge. There is one spring that can be found along the Hanalei side of the parcel. This research provides the environmental, cultural, historic, and archaeological b ackground for the project area. The sources examined are used here to formulate a predictive model regarding expected site types and locations of historic properties in the project area. Consultation The author has been to the parcel some 10 -20 years ag o either at a Planning Commission inspection or an inspection by the Kaua'i Historic Preservation Review Commission, both at the time Kaua'i County Planner Anne Schneider and former VP of Princeville Corp., Michael Loo recalled the site visit with several community members, commissioners, US Fish and Wildlife staff, County, DLNR and Princeville staff. It has been suggested that US Fish and Wildlife use the location to move the Hanalei Valley Overlook to. But there was concern about burials or a cemetery on the parcel, so a site visit was conducted. Some place shortly after the entrance but off the highway, through the thicket of guava, three stone mounds (one large, a second mound which was similar in size to the first mound and a small mound) were identif ied and pointed out to by the community stating that these were burials. During that field inspection, some community members speculated that those were mounds contained burials. But no one knew who they were nor were any claims made. At that time, SHPD Kauai Archaeologist Nancy McMahon did not write u p a field report on this site inspection nor identify any burial sites since this could not be verified and no one came forward to claim the burials. After seeing the mounds US Fish and Wildlife did not purs ue buying the parcel from then owner Princeville Corporation. Around 2014, the construction of a rock gate at the entrance to the parcel was being constructed. The author received a call from the Kauai Archaeologist, Mary Jane Naone, asking if I knew abou t any historic properties on that parcel as she had heard from others in the community about something up there. I told her the story about the three mounds. When I received a call about this property from the realtor of the current owner, I related the same story. Prior to the archaeological survey, consultation with the current SHPD staff on Kauai, the burials sites specialist was taken out for a site inspection on October 19, 2017. No information was brought forward from this field inspection. No rec ords exist for the Burial Program on this location. The SHPD burial specialist quest ioned the author as to why they were not recorded as burial sites. The author stated no confirmation existed nor did anyone come forward with a claim. The field inspectio n revealed that the plateau of the ridge was cleared and grass and some trees existed. The boundary edges had a push pile of dirt and vegetation but no mounds were found. Exploration Associates Ltd. contacted several members of the Hanalei and Princeville community to ascertain if they had any knowledge of the former uses of this parcel or the immediate area adjacent to the project area. Only one person, Jay Furfar o remembered that the Kellett family (part of his family) might be buried there and provide d a headstone plaque. No exact location was known for this family burial location. The Kellet t's acquired much of the surrounding lands and possibly this parcel . Jay also mentioned that an ahu existed on the parcel. EXPLORATION ASSOCIATES LTD 47 In about November 2016, Barbara Say, her son and the neighbor went out to look for the Chinese Cemetery which they thought was in this area but they could not find anything on this parcel . Another informant, Kaleo Chandler was hired to help clear the parcel by hand with chainsaws by the previ ous owner. The author met him on the parcel on December 1, 2016 where he recalled that as a boy, he thought there was a Chinese cemetery in this area with urns, flags markers, and stones to mark where they buried the urns a year after the death. He said he stayed away from the side where he believed to be the Cemetery was located during his clearing. He also mentioned a pre -contact historic property where the rock formations are located at the point. He took the author, where rock alignments and then a wall above the Hanalei Bay Overlook were identified . He recalled the area was a party area for the high schoolers, and used by pig hunters and pot growers. He suggested speaking to Michael Olanalan who took care of the parcel when the movie the South Pacifi c was shot there. Michael Olanalan was interviewed in February 21, 2017, Michael did not recall a Chinese Cemetery nor a heiau nor ahu in the parcel. He thought the rock wall I saw was maybe from the old highway that was there. He thought I should find r emnants of that old highway. He said it was a party place, he hunted there with his father for pigs and recently lots of pot growers were in there. Michael said that when the movie \"The South Pacific\" was being filmed there, they put the dirt road in on t he plateau. He thought it might be possible to find some of the old set props but he could not recall if they left it there or removed things. The author spoke to Maka`ala Ka`aumoana. She had emailed previously about a pre -contact historic property on th e ridge , where she heard it was a heiau . She also mentioned there should be some waterworks on the lower slopes of the parcel, but this appears to be below the Hanalei Overlook and on Hanalei Wildlife Refuge lands and not on this parcel. The Ching Ma Leon g store was previously located within 1/4 -mile, downslope from the proposed project. This store used water from a pipe that received water from a perennial spring located in the hillside within proximity to this proposed project site. Post hurricanes, the community of this place utilized springs to provide water to its residents. Thus, perennial springs are considered by the community to be an important natural, cultural, and economic resource , but are not located on this parcel. Barbara Robeson provided so me background about the Hanalei Valley area and knew about the old road directly up from the Hanalei Bridge by the power station, where there was a store, Post Office and Plantation Home, which she said she had photos of along the old road up from the Hanalei Bridge. Again, this area in not on the parcel for this project but appears to be on the US Fish and Wildlife Service Lands. Michael Ching also provided some information about his knowledge regarding Chinese burials. He stated he heard rumors of buria ls on the ridge but not Chinese. The Chinese cemetery started around 1803 and the Chinese stayed in that area being very good at taking care of their ancestors. Only once did he know of a case in Oahu where they found Chinese urns outside of a cemetery b oundary. He did not believe any Chinese were buried on Kaunuhua Ridge. He was also aware of this parcel and helped some physicians look at this parcel to build a joint home there. EXPLORATION ASSOCIATES LTD 48 A cultural impact assessment will be performed in accordance with Act 50 , Session Laws of Hawai`i, 2000, raised a primary concern relative to cultural impacts: it was suggested that a fresh water spring associated with traditional uses is in the vicinity of this parcel. It can be seen from the side of Route 560. EXPLORATION ASSOCIATES LTD 49 RESULTS O F FIELDWORK The initial fieldwork on October 21, 2016 by principal investigator and principal archaeologist Nancy McMahon of EAL. After approval of the Site Approval Plan by DLNR, Nancy McMahon, M.A., M.Ed, M.S. and Linz Amstrong, B.A. field archaeologis t, completed subsurface testing of six backhoe test trenches April 25 within the project area. Additional field work was conducted on the parcel on the following dates April 24 -25, May 20, 27, June 1 and July 14. This field work including a pedestrian ins pection of as much as the property that we could walk safely, intensely walking the area where informants stated a Chinese cemetery or Chinese burials located, and where an informant showed me a rock wall which he stated was might be part of a pre-contact historic property . On A pril 21 and 22, Linz Armstrong and Milton Ching, tried to survey the steep slopes adjacent to Khi Highway but because of the dense vegetation, only along the north and eastern sides at 5 meters abreast that area of the parcel was pedestrian surveyed. Ad ditional field work was conducted for monitoring the geological coring, clearing the pre - contact historic property , and re -walking the property with the biological team. A approximately 80% of the property had a surface survey conducted and recorded at 2 h istoric properties: old government road and a pre -contact historic property . Figures 11 -12 shows the AIS Plan. The parcel on the south and southwest side was quite steep and cliff like in various portions. A trail was identified but additional survey show that this man -made and pig trail is for southern exposures created for Cannabis cultivation. Go -pots, weed block fabric, a shovel and stone line pits (at least 4 were counted) were observed. These trail leads to all the pits and is directly off Khi Hig hway on the south side. It appears that shortly before the walled entrance to the property was built in 2014, the activity has been abandoned. Informants also noted, that this was a party area to smoke pot but also it appears to be a small- scale pot produc tion area too. The subsurface fieldwork component was conducted on April 25, 2017 by archaeologists, Nancy McMahon and Linz Armstrong. Bob Farias Jr. was the backhoe operator with a 15 -in. bucket. Every attempt was made to place the trenches in proposed f oot print of the building and where the possible mound locations were believed to be. Three trenches were excavated using a backhoe. Figure shows the trench locations, which were in areas to be disturbed by the single -family residence development. This included swimming pool location, anaerobic waste water system and utility location. Each trench evinced the same soil composition. All six trenches contain the same stratigraphy. Soils i n all trenches consist ed of two layers, with a flat boundary delineating the topsoil fr om the underlying deposit. The topsoil is fill mixed with organics from the overlying grasses. The topsoil in each trench was 5 YR 5/4 or 4/4 reddish brown from surface to .30 cmbs, and the soil from 0.30 cmbs to the base of excavation a 2.5 YR 4/6 or 5/4 dry, dark reddish brown or red ; moderate, to coarse, sub -angular blocky structure; hard, firm, with a slightly plastic consistency , small peds, and clear boundary. Figures 13 -15 show some photographs of the test trenches. No cultural material was found. EXPLORATION ASSOCIATES LTD 50 Figure 11.

Subsurface testing strategy located within the single -family residence and proposed infrastructure. EXPLORATION ASSOCIATES LTD 52 Test Trench Profiles and Description The overall soil homogeneity was high throughout the project area. As noted above, the soils identified during excavations were comparable to the sediments described by Foote et al. (1972): dusky -red silty clay, with subsoil that was red to dark reddish br own, compact silty clay with a sub angular, blocky structure. Excavations ceased at an average 1.30 mbs due to the lack of cultural materials and continuation of the same, sterile soils. The topsoil in each trench was 5 YR 5/4 or 4/4 reddish brown from surface to .30 cmbs, and the soil from 0.30 cmbs to the base of excavation a 2.5 YR 4/6 or 5/4 dry, dark reddish brown or red; moderate, to coarse, sub -angular blocky structure; hard, firm, with a slightly plastic consistency , small peds, and clear boundary.

Surface Survey Results The surface survey concentrated on locations where oral information was given to EAL that there might be historic properties or a cemetery on this property. One informant did locate a wall where he remembered was a pre -contact historic property and showed the author. Further work in this area lead to the identification of a possible pre -contact historic property which i s described below. With regards to the information a bout a Chinese cemetery on the parcel, no indications could be found. Within Hanalei there are several cemeteries, the Hanalei Chinese cemetery, the Japanese Cemetery in Waioli, the Waioli Mission Church graveyard, and an old cemetery across from the form er Hanalei Court House, now a day -care school, and a small private cemetery located on the ridge top just south of hole 7 tee of the Princeville Golf Course that contains 5 grave markers. The Hawaii Chinese History Center in 1979 did survey the Hanalei Chinese Cemetery which is located within the Hanalei Wildlife Refuge (Tin -Yuke and Char 1979:167). An island wide cemetery survey was conducted by Kikuchi and Remoaldo in 1986. Neither one of these studies identified a Chinese cemetery on this parcel. Physic al survey did not reveal broken urns or human remain fragments in the area where informants said there c ould be a Chine se cemetery . Subsurface testing also conducted did not reveal pit features or urns. EXPLORATION ASSOCIATES LTD 56 Historic Properties Two historic properties were iden tified during the archaeological inventory survey of the parcel. The historic properties were given EAL temporary site numbers (EAL #1 and EAL #2) until SIHP numbers were obtained. SIHP# 50-30-03-0235 3 (EAL #1 ) the old government SIHP# 50-30-03-02354 (EAL #2 ) is a pre -contact historic property comprised of basalt features: a wall, two cairns and scattered rock alignments . Each historic property will be discussed below. Figure 16 shows the historic properties location in the plan view relative to the single -family residence. Figures 26 and 27 show the sites location on the USGS map and tax map. SIHP# 50 -30-03-02353 EAL #: EAL# 1 Site Type: Road (Remnant ) of 1 Functional Interpretation: Transportation Probable Age: Post-Contact Overall Dimensions: Approximately 264.0 m long (NW/SE) by 5.1 m wide Topography: Level to gently sloping Elevation: 240 to 160 ft AMSL SIHP# 50 -30-03-02353 is a level road bed about 6 -8 ft. wide in most places. A lot of soil slippage is evident by several landslides. The road starts at the top of the property across from the Hanalei Fire station. It continues downhill, a couple of sections are missing due to these landslides and ends at the first highway curve sign. This is just above the spring and pot hole area of the Kuhio Highway. Figure 17 is an aerial showing the road. It is identifiable by the vegetation line. Kuhio Highway is clearly indicated on several historic maps, as early as 1885, usually as \"Government Road.\" This road was aligned between the river and the extensive agr icultural cultivation mauka of the road and retains the alignment to the present day. As late as 1895, Eric Knudesn observed that the wagon road ended at Hanalei and now it was only a trail (Knudsen 1940:3). While the road from Princeville plateau now winds its way down to the Valley floor in a circuitous route, this has not always been so. The present alignment of the roadway has passed through at least two major revisions since the mid nineteenth century. While very early maps of Hanalei indicated the current road locations, the 1893 survey of Hanalei retraced from Walls 1833 map, indicates a new road running from the approximate location of the current Hanalei Overlook, d own the hill to the location of the Hanalei Bridge. The road, as it descends the hillside, with 3 S curves, passes the original Hanalei Post Office and the site of the Princeville Plantation House then later called the Princeville Ranch House which was lived in and owned and improved at various times by Wylie, Wundenberg and Sanborn ( See Figure 18) (Thousand Friends...1987:58). This home was initially called Kikuila. Figure 18 also shows a butcher shop near where the fire station is located today. Michael Ching in an informal interview stated that it was a slaughter house. He said he remembered when the entrance is today to Princeville (fountain now rock walls) was the Ranch House. Also, visible on this map is the original zig zag trail up the ridge from the Hanalei Bridge. This road is on the National Wildlife Refuge lands. Figure 19 is a photograph of the current condition of this historic property. EXPLORATION ASSOCIATES LTD 57 By 1904, this new alignment was drawn as the primary route and the current alignment was labeled the \"old road\". Many portions of the 1893 roadway were traced from the previous survey. It is not known when the \"new road was abandoned in favor of the o ld alignment. During the survey for the cultural landscape study (Thousand Friends... 1987), they attempted to find this old road bed but could not due to the dense vegetation cover. In reviewin g the various historic topographic maps through time, various details get lost (Figures 20- 24). Figure 25 is a 1966 map from the electrical systems showing the old road alignment.EXPLORATION ASSOCIATES LTD 58 Figure 16. Project Area showing historic prope rties locations (EAL#2) .

Probable Age: Post Contact Site Descriptions : A portion of old government road , constructed around 1833 -93. Significance : SIHP# 50 -30-03-02353 is determined under Hawaii Register eligible under criteria d (have yielded or may be likely to yield information important in prehistory or history) . Recommendation: There is no direct impact to this historic property and technica lly, it will be preserved \"as is\", since there are slope erosion issues, no further work is recommended for this historic property. SIHP# 50 -30-03-02353 is a road remnant that is located within the southeastern portion of the project parcel along the slope below the ridge edge overlooking Hanalei Valley . The road remnant measures approximately 264.0 m long (NW/SE) with an average width of 5.1m. The location of the remnant portion of SIHP# - 02353 [closely][accurately] corresponds to the road alignment depicted on the 18 93 Wall map and labelled as \"old gov 't road\" but not the 1833 Wall map . The remnant portion documented during the current AIS, is visible on a google orthophoto of Hanalei discernible by a vegetation change (Figure 17). Figure 1 9is a picture of the road. There are significant road cuts is present along the length of the road that e xtends as deep as 3.0 m (10 ft). Loose basalt stone cobbles and small boulders were observed on the road surface which are caused by landslides from the road cuts. The downslope edge of the northwestern portion of SIHP# -02353 ends when it meets Route 560. The southeastern portion of SIHP# - 02353 consists of some steep or vertical drop s-offs due to landslides where the width of the road is about 2.0 m. Modern disturbances to SIHP# -02353 include some excavated pits in several locations for cannabis growers. SIHP# -02353is a road remnant with an interpreted function of transportation. A review of historic maps suggests that SIHP# - 02353 was constructed be tween 1833 -1893 , within the post -contact era. No EXPLORATION ASSOCIATES LTD 71 artifacts or cultural material was observed within the remnant road alignment. SIHP# 50 -30-03-xxxx (road remnant) has been evaluated as significant under c riterion d (have yielded, or may be likely to yield information important in prehistory or history). Above the old government road, a foot trail was also observed, just off the ridge and paralleling the ridge, this trail co ntinues past the Hanalei Scenic Overlook in Kalihiwai Investors LLC, property. I t appears that it was created for Cannabis cultivation. In walking this path , grow -pots, black plastic po ts, weed block fabric, and a broken shovel were found. This activity w as also recorded by Cultural Surveys Hawaii in their survey for the new Hanalei Overlook (Hammatt et. al. of Features: 4 Functional Interpretation: Unknown Probable Age: Pre-Contact (NE/SW) Topography: Moderately level Elevation: 280 to 290 ft Above Mean Sea Level (AMSL) SIHP# 50 -30-03-02354 was found in the location where an informant stated there was a pre -contact historic property . During the first inspect ion of the area with the information, some stone alignments were identified as well as the wall. During the reconnaissance of the area, in addition to the wall two rock cairns or alters or mounds were identified. All three features align due north. Initial thoughts were these mounds the ones the author saw several years ago but back then, it was three mounds and no wall. Upon taking Susan Lebo to look at the historic property, she wanted the area which is thick in guava to be cleared. Additional scatter stones can be found on the flat surface behind the two mounds. The area also is thick in moss covering the rocks. Figure 2 7 is a preliminary plan view map. Figures 2 8-35 are photographs showing the features and the historic property.

The parcel and SIHP# -02354 is bounded by the Route 560 to the north, to the east, and to the northwest (Figure 27 and 28). The nature of the site and its position overlooking culturally significant Hanalei Bay with views in the distance to Haena Point. EXPLORATION ASSOCIATES LTD 80 Currently Site# 02354 was covered in thick vegetation consisting primarily of strawberry guava, cat's claw, and moss. The guava trees form a canopy up to 15 feet high. The ground surface is covered with leaf litter from the guava and other vegetatio n, along with moss. The amount of leaf litter on the ground surface makes it difficult to discern. The extent of human modification in this terracing is unclear. The pre-contact historic property is on a level area above Route 560. It is in the shape of an elongated square, oriented northwest to southeast. It is approximately 16 m N/S by 8 m S by 10 m E x 12 m NE. There are four (4) distinct features - a rock wall, and two mounds. The rock wall is on the western side fronting the two mounds, located due no rth. Along the north and northwest sides of the wall the property drops off into the highway. Several concentrations of small basalt stoners were observed scattered beyond the two rock cairns to the east. It could not be discerned whether these were remna nts of any kind of structure. After clearing some of the moss, these stones appear to be on the ground surface, some clumped together. The two -faced mounds on all sides are adjacent to the wall and in line with the wall due north. There is a clear alignme nt on the sides where these scattered stones are located. The south side is 7.62 meters in length, the east side is 9.75 meters in length and the north side is 11.28 meters in length. The distance between the mounds approximately 15 ft. or 4.52 meters . Fe#1 South Rock Mound - This is the southern mound, which is a basalt cobble filled platform built on a cobble base above ground. It highest point is .75 meters. It is 15 inches from the wall. The dimensions are 2.25 meters in length, 1.524 meters wide, . 60-.75 meters in height. GPS: 22 12'43\"N 159 28'58\"W Fe#2 North Rock Mound - This mound has some collapse on the west side. It appears to be slightly smaller than FE#1 but slightly higher. It is 2.1336 meters in length, 1.4935 meters in wide and .88 meters in height. GPS: 22 12'43\"N 159 28'58\"W Fe#3 A basalt cobble filled wall, with its highest point at 0.48 -0.55 meters above the surface. It is 15.54 meters in length. It is 0.91 -1.524 meters in width. The extreme corners of the wall align with the shap e of the pre -contact historic forming a kite shape structure. Rocks are covered with about 4 inches of moss. These do not appear to be stack like the mounds but rather scattered in alignments. GPS: 22 12' 43\"N 159 28' Age: Pre -Contact Site Descriptions: A kite shaped rock formation [ a pre-contact historic property ], with two large mounds at the southern end, fronting tha t is a rock wall, then the edge of the ridge. Both mounds and wall align due north. Significance: SIHP# 50 -30-03-02354 is determined to be Hawaii Register of Historic Places eligible under multiple criteria. It is significant under criterions: d (have yi elded or may be likely to yield information important in prehistory or history) and e (value to the Native Hawaiian people or to another ethic group due to associations with cultural practices). EXPLORATION ASSOCIATES LTD 81 Recommendation: There is not direct impacts to this histori c property . A preservation plan is recommended for this significant historic property. It will be preserved \"as is\" with no interpretation. It will also be maintained by the owner, so that no damage can be done by the surrounding dense guava vegetation , that had taken over in the past . EXPLORATION ASSOCIATES LTD 82 ARCHAEOLOGICAL MONITORING OF GEOLOGICAL CORING As agreed to in the SPA -KA-17-41, archaeological monitoring was conducted on April 24 and 25, 2017 for the geological coring to gather information on the nature, distribution and characteristics of the subsurface earth materials and ground water conditions for recommendations for project design and construction. Maximum depth five bore holes 14.5 feet or 4.4196 meters. Archaeologist, Linz Armstrong, B.A. under the dir ection of EAL principal archaeologist monitored the borings. Boring auger was 4 inches in diameter. Figure 3 6, shows the boring location within the footprint of the proposed residence. No cultural material was found during the coring activities.

EXPLORATION ASSOCIATES LTD 87 SUMMARY Conclusion The ahupua'a of Hanalei has been densely populated and modified by human means during the pre - Contact through the 21st century. Though extensive Native Hawaiian agricultural sites and historic rice and cane agriculture has obliterated many of th ese historic properties in the valley proper, it was postulated that historic period sites related to ranching might be present in the project area. However, recent utilization of the uplands and the modern use of the subject parcel suggest that any remnan t historic properties that may have been present are gone. Overall, subsurface testing predominantly revealed homogenous natural silty clay strata. Rumors of a Chinese Cemetery could not be verified both archaeological searching through subsurface testing and searching records and through an interview with one of the Hanalei Chinese family. Oral information, and a personal tour, did verify finding the old road bed and a pre -contact historic property on the parcel. Surface and subsurface results for the pro posed project area (a single -family residence and its ancillary infrastructure) concluded that no historic properties in this location. The two historic properties are assessed for their significance based on criteria established and promoted by SHPD and c ontained in HAR Chapter 13 -284-16. This significance evaluation should be considered as preliminary until SHPD provides concurrence. For a resource to be considered significant it must possess integrity of location, design, setting, materials, workmanship, feeling and association and meet one or more of the following criteria: a associated with events that have made an important contribution to the broad patterns of our history; b a ssociated with the lives of persons important in our past; c embodies the distinctive characteristics of a type, period, or method of construction, represents the work of a master, or possesses high artistic value; d h ave yielded, or is likely to yield information importan t for research on prehistory or history; e have an important value to the native Hawaiian people or to another ethnic group of the state due to associations with cultural practices once carried out, or still carried out, at the property, or due to associations with traditional beliefs, events or oral history accounts - these associations being important to the group's history and cultural identity. Both historic properties retain sufficient integrity for evaluation and all have been evaluated under each historic property description and summarized in Table 4. Both sites are significant because they yield information important for research on prehistory and history for this area. Site SIHP# 50 -30-03-02354 is also significant for its importance to native Hawaiian people. EXPLORATION ASSOCIATES LTD 88 Table 4.

Neither site s are being impacted by the proposed development of this parcel. Preservation i s recommended for SIHP# 50 -30-03-02354 . Recommended preservation treatment is \"as is\" or passive preservation. A preservation plan is recommended for SIHP# 50 -30-03-02354 with a more detailed map of the site should be done, to determine age and function of the historic property. No further work is recommended for SIHP# 50 -30- 03-02353 , although it is also being preserved as is , due to its hazardous location . Subsurface test ing in the house foundation, swimming pool with spa, wastewater system and utility alignment had negative historic properties findings. No further archaeological work is recommended for the proposed construction in the project area. EAL has made a determi nation effect for this single -family residence including the swimming pool and ancillary improvements : \"no effect with agreed upon mitigation commitments \". The recommended mitig ation is preservation of SIHP # 50-30-03-02354 with an approved preservation plan which includes detailed mapping of SIHP# 50-30-03-02354.

Cultural Impact Assessment 1 Introduction At the request of Michael Gearon, Exploration Associates (EAL) conducted a Cultural Impact Assessment (CIA) of a 14.109- acre parcel (TMK (4) 5 4004:032 which is in the Hanalei Ahupua`a, Hanalei District on Kaua`i Island (Figures 1 - 3). Hereinafter referred to as \" project area and/or the subject property\". The subject property is located at Khi Highway at the intersection of Hanalei Plantation Road in Princeville, Island of Kaua`i, Hawai`i. The subject property is located approximately 280 feet above mean sea level at it's highest elevation down to about 40 feet above mean sea level at it's lowest elevation. The pr operty is located on adjacent to, and mauka of Khi Highway Route 560, just west of the Hanalei Valley Lookout owned by the US Fish and Wildlife Service. The property is bordered to the north, west and south by Khi Highway Route 560, also known as Kauia's Belt Road, which is listed a Historic District on the National Register of Historic Places and includes the Hanalei Overlook, culverts and the Hanalei Bridge which is just below this subject property. The Hanalei Bridge is also on the State and National Register of Historic Places. The property to the to the west and throughout Hanalei Valley is owned by the US Fish and Wildlife Service and operated as Hanalei National Wildlife Refuge (HNWR). The HNWF is also listed as eligible for the National Register of Historic Places. To the north is in residential and commercial uses. The subject property includes all the land above the hairpin curve of Khi Highway which leads down to Hanalei River and Hanalei town. There are no building or other structural improv ements. The property is not serviced by any utilities other than a water meter. The project requires compliance with the State of Hawai`i environmental review process [Hawai`i Revised Statutes (HRS) Chapter 13 -343, which mandates consideration of a propo sed project's effect on traditional Hawaiian practices and beliefs. This cultural impact assessment provides information pertinent to the evaluation of the proposed project's cultural impacts. Additionally, this CIA report provides documentation of the pro ject's consultation efforts under applicable state historic preservation legislation. Methodology Methodologies guided by indigenous Hawaiian cultural perspectives and intellect were used to conduct this study. It is always imperative that traditional val ues of aloha and h`ihi (sincerity, love and respect) are ever present in the actions of the research and investigative team that engages with the natural environments, resources, people and communities from which/whom information will be Cultural Impact Assessment 2 gathered for this work. Special focus and attention is given to the examination of the land, water and atmospheric features that are applicable to the study project area and all lands and environments associated with it. At the onset of this project, EAL entered this work with much enthusiasm and confidence of already \"knowing\" this place. Even with a limited window of time to conform to, EAL knew that only a little had been documented to bring forth the values and depth of traditional Hawaiian knowledge and customary prac tices of Hanalei's ancient past. Information and personal experiences that EAL possessed provided an advantage to accomplish the task of completing this cultural impact assessment study. Much of the effort in conducting studies such as this is to review a nd evaluate the land allocated for the project area and any possible adverse influences and consequences relating to indigenous Hawaiian beliefs and practices. However, it would be negligent to limit, reduce or exclude a discussion on two of the most prom inent components that are necessary and vital to this development project. In the process of gathering, assembling and documenting information from our research and interviews, EAL realized there was a need to address and include a chronicle of events and cultural impacts associated with native Hawaiian land, resources and its people that dates back more than 192 years of history. Even though this development project did not contribute to any of this history, EAL strongly feel that ramifications and impacts that native Hawaiians face today because of it, are still attached to the land. For these reasons, EAL were pressed by our own conscience and ethics to present this history as part of the study. Over the years, much has changed as the population has grown and the number of homes developed in Hanalei/Princeville has quadrupled. The winds with their characteristics that were known to our ancestors by specific names, still bring us comfort, rain and even challenges during stormy conditions. Hanalei is still a town community descended from a rich and vibrant Native Hawaiian culture and ancestors who knew this land these islands so intimately. The relationships they held with the natural world as divine and godly, influenced levels of consciousness that dictated every aspect of native Hawaiian life ways and cultural practices. Scope of Work 1. Conduct in- depth research and examinations of historical documents, maps, archaic and historic period Hawaiian chants, mo`o `lelo or oral traditions, and any references related to or associated with the immediate and surrounding areas 2. Conduct field studies of the project area, and surrounding areas ma uka and ma kai (upland and seaward). This will include, but not be limited to Cultural Impact Assessment 3 the ahupua`a or traditional land divis ions of Hanalei and Halele 'a. 3. Review existing and new archaeological information pertaining to the project site and all related areas will be perused in our quest to identify and describe cultural resources, traditional land use activities, spiritual and religious beliefs and customary practices. 4 Conduct interviews with Native Hawaiian cultural practitioners, elders and families knowledgeable about the historic and traditional practices in the project area and region. Such information may be obtained through individual, group and community meetings, as well as huaka`i or cultural site excursions with selected native Hawaiian kpuna or elder informants, kumu hula or other experienced and seasoned practitioners and experts who have firsthand knowledge of religious, spiritual, cultural, healing, gathering or subsistence practices. 5. Upon con clusion of tasks 1 - 4, a cultural impact assessment will be prepared to report findings of the collective studies, including narrative summaries relating to Native H awaiian customary practices, resources and land use. Compose a summary of findings and determination of the extent to which applicable resources, including traditional and customary Native Hawaiian rights and practices that will be affected or impaired by the project. Environmental Setting The parcel and project area sits within the Hanalei Ahupua 'which is in the traditional district of Halele and the judicial district of Hanalei. Hanalei Ahupua 'a encompasses 68.5 sq km of land and is present between latitudes 22\u00b013' north and 22\u00b04'30\" south and longitudes 159\u00b027'30\" east and 159\u00b031' west. It is bounded on the west by Wai` oli Ahupua `a and on the east 'a. The ahupua' a is amphitheater -shaped, the ridges surrounding the Hanal ei River. Hanalei River is the largest stream system in the state (Federal Register 2002). The ahupua 'a extends from sea level, north at Hanalei Bay, to the top of Mt. Wai 'ale'ale (5,148 ft) in the south. Three- quarters of the ahupua 'a lies in the Halele' a Forest Reserve. This valley is a typical windward valley with one large perennial stream, the Hanalei River, fed by many tributaries. \"Perhaps 9 km inland, the valley widens somewhat and the stream begins to meander. Here there are considerable alluvial deposits in the bends of the stream \" (Earle 1978:34). Alluvial floodplains are located on both sides of the river as it meanders down to Hanalei Bay. The annual rainfall of Hanalei ranges from 75 inches to as much as 450 inches at the summit of Wai' ale'ale, which is considered one of the world 's rainiest areas (Foote et al. 1972:6). Cultural Impact Assessment 4 The project area is on an east/west trending ridge known as Kaunu `pua or alternatively as Kauakaniunu (Kikuchi 1992:3) that turns toward the mouth of the Hanalei River to the west. Kaunu `pua is a variation of the word kaulu which refers to high places such as a pali or cliff. In this case the word kaunu refers to a place high in the clouds. This would indicate it is one of the places in Papahulilani, where the heavens turn p art of the Hawaiian universe. Papahulihonua is a power that turns phenomena associated with the earth, like the currents, volcanic eruptions, rivers, and streams. Therefore, Kaunu 'opua translates as that place in the heavens where clouds are formed. It is said that this is the realm of Keaomelemele, the maiden of the golden clouds or the keeper of all cloud forms. Keaomelemele is fascinated with cloud forms and has a deep love for them. Kauakaniunu is the name of a rain and a westerly wind which forms in the cloud space and falls upon this ridge. The generalization and clustering of traditional places to common districts (i.e. Anahola, Kapa`a, L hu`e, etc.) has become acceptable, widespread practice in the western framework of identifying and relating to places on Kaua`i. Therein lays an example of how easily a traditional Hawaiian land area or division can be incorrectly identified, misunderstoo d and misinterpreted as a significant place of its own. It is important to stress at the onset , that we all have a shared responsibility - for this and any future projects to advocate for the proper use and application of traditional Hawaiian place names and Hawaiian words. The continual use and application of traditional names of places are one of the fundamental ways in which to preserve knowledge and insight of important locations. Within Hawaiian names are contained history, stories, special phenomeno n and characteristics about places. They preserve occurrences and observable facts and experiences associated with traditional places known to our k puna in times past. Today they are equally, if not more important to the present and future generations of Kaua`i and Hawai`i. A considerable amount of focus is put toward the research of traditional places, their names and stories when preparing studies such as this. It is minamina, a sad and unfortunate loss when valuable information is lost or forgotten. T here is an urgent need to preserve and pass on ancestral knowledge that was widely known just a few generations ago. Kaua`i's unique culture and heritage associated with traditional places are key to nurturing a sense of place and connectivity. It is a vital component to the health and wellbeing of native Hawaiians, as well as the perpetuation of native Hawaiian life ways and culture. The Hawaiian tradition of name giving is a centuries -old custom that involves Cultural Impact Assessment 5 process and purpose. In ancient times, personal possessions were few, but highly valued. A name however, was considered amongst the most prized possessions of all. As with any precious newborn child, names were given only after much careful thought, and observation. The same is applicable for tradit ional places as well. Early Hawaiians gave names to mountains, mountain peaks, streams and valleys. They also gave names to forests, plains, taro patches and salt pans, as well as the various winds and rains that were to different locations and regions. Ev ery promontory, reef, fish house and storied place had a name as well. Again, the land and ocean were considered the extended nature family that the Hawaiian people interacted and developed strong bonds with. It is the basis of the expressions - mlama ` ina and aloha ` ina, meaning to \"care for and have love for the land\". It was not uncommon for names to be inspired or received through supernatural advice of departed ancestors, spirit guardians or gods. Prayer, meditation and ceremony were important to t he process of name seeking and name giving. For names received in this manner did not only provide a unique individuality and identity for the receiver. It became a mainstay for the health, well -being and prosperity for the individual, home or place. There is a great sense of responsibility attached with a name once it is bestowed upon a person, place, object or project. Names are not simply \"labels\". Whether it is name for a person or a name for a place, they are honored and treated with aloha and pride. What may appear as trifling and unimportant on the surface, are oftentimes filled with profound wonder. Halele' a and Hanalei are such places that continue to hold an abundance of history and inspiration. Cultural Impact Assessment 6 Figure 1.

It is also the northwestern- most island, with O`ahu as its closest volcanic sibling separated by the tempestuous Ka`ie`ie Channel which is more than 72 miles long. In centuries past, Kaua`i's isolation from the other islands kept it safe from outside invasion and unwarranted conflict. Cultural Overview Poetically the island is called, \"Mankalanip\", or \"Kaua`i a M an\" after the ancient chief who was largely responsible for elevating Kaua`i's ancient society to sophisticated heights of advancement and productivity. For centuries, from the time of Mankalanip's reign, through Kamehameha's unsuccessful attempts to Cultural Impact Assessment 9 invade Kaua`i in 1796 and 1804, Kaua`i remained free from warfare. In 1810, Kaumuali`i accepted Kamehameha as the supreme ali`i by peacefully ceding Kaua`i to the newly United Kingdom of Hawai`i. With honor, Kaumuali`i was encouraged to return to rule on Ka ua`i as its tributary chief under Kamehameha I. In accordance with the ancient land division system, an entire island is referred to as a mokupuni . While the word, moku by itself can also mean island, it is a term that is more specifically used to identify a district. Puni means, controlled, surrounded, to gain control of. It comes from the word, aupuni which is used to describe a government, kingdo m, dominion, nation, or population that is governed or under the leadership of a ruler. In ancient times, a mokupuni could include an entire island as well as multiple islands that was ruled by an Ali`i Nui or paramount chief. Historically, the mokupuni of Kaua`i has included the islands of Ni`ihau as well as Lehua. Kaua`i Island has traditionally been divided into 5 moku Ko`olau, Halele`a, N appointed ali`i `ai moku or district chiefs to manage the various m oku. Common district names that are universally used across of the Hawaiian archipelago include \"Ko`olau\" marking the windward sides of the islands; \"Kona\" - the leeward sides of the islands; and \"Puna\" - indicating regions where springs and fresh water a bound. Figure 4 & 5 show Kaua`i Island Districts and Boundaries. Fig 4 on the left show the original moku of Ko`olau, Halele`a, N Pali, Kona and Puna. Fig 5 on the right show the revised boundaries and judicial land districts of Kawaihau, Hanalei, Waimea, Kloa and Lhu`e. Cultural Impact Assessment 10 The boundaries of the five moku on Kaua`i were changed in the late 1800s to reflect the present day judicial land districts. The Project Area is located in the Hanalei district upon land within the Hanalei ahupua`a. Traditionally, the districts were further divided into smaller land divisions known as, ahupua`a which included the abundance of land and resources from the mountain to the sea. Under the direction of the ali`i `ai m oku, the ali`i `ai ahupua`a or land division chief was put in charge of governing the ahupua`a. The ali`i `ai ahupua`a appointed konohiki who served as the headman of the ahupua`a land division, and was solely responsible for the management of land, water and fishing rights. An ingenious concept, the ancient design of the ahupua`a system continues to be an excellent model for sustainability and land and natural resource management today. A major element of focus for this CIA is based on the `ina or land t hat is the project area, as well as surrounding lands and natural resources that are linked to the project area. It is important to readers of this CIA to have a basic understanding of the ancient land division system and the various words, terms and idioms associated with Hawaiian land designation and Hawaiian land use. This is especially helpful in identifying and relating to specific locations and place names that are pertinent to this study. Kaua`i or Kau`ai? Proper Pronunciation of Island There has been on- going discussions and statements by many historians and long - time kama`ina families about the proper pronunciation of the name of this island . \"Kama`ina families\" is a term that are generally used for families descended from the post -contact missionary ancestors who settled in the Hawaiian Islands in the 1800s. One of the tasks accomplished by the first company of missionaries that arrived in 1820 was to develop an alphabet and written form of the Hawaiian language using vowels and consonants . Out of necessity, many of them learned the language well enough to understand, speak and communicate with native Hawaiians. This was a major milestone that quickly won the interest and favor of Kamehameha II and Ka`ahumanu who were the ruling chiefs of the time. They saw great value in education and the opportunity to transition from a century - old oral culture to a society with acquired skills in reading and writing. Not only in `lelo haole or English, but in `lelo Hawai`i or the Hawaiian language as well. Cultural Impact Assessment 11 Elder non- Hawaiian kama`ina claim that the correct pronunciation for the island name is Kauai (with no diacritical markings). Phonetically, they pronounce the name as, \"Cow -why\". Some pronounced the island as , Kau`ai (Cow -eye) with the `okina or glottal stop on the second syllable of the word; reasoning that it means, \"season of food and of plenty \" because people never experienced famine due to the bountiful water resources. Contrary to this claim and the fact that Kaua`i is abundant with annual measures of rainfall and fresh water, there are many accounts of sustainability hardships endured in times past. In researching many oral history recordings preserved in the Bishop Museum Archives in Honolulu, O`ahu of interviews with na tive Hawaiian elders on Kaua`i between 1959 - 1968. Led by Bishop Musem's primary interviewer and Hawaiian expert and scholar, Mary Kawena Pukui, majority of the recorded discussions were conducted in Hawaiian. Native Hawaiian interviewees from Kaua`i inc luded all pronounce the island name as Kaua`i. In another recording of a Bishop Museum Interview, Mary Kawena Pukui poses the same question separately to two different kpuna if Kaua`i is the correct pronunciation. They confirm that it is. Translation of traditional Hawaiian place names For this study, EAL has made special effort to expand upon the various place names associated with the immediate project area as well as the extended land areas that include the ahupua`a of Hanalei. It was important th at EAL not only limit ourselves to the written literature and documents available. EAL made several field visits to various sites to look at land, ocean and atmospheric traits, and spoke with Native Hawaiian kpuna and informant kama`ina who are intimate ly familiar with the study locations. Loosely translating Hawaiian place names from the pages of a dictionary is not good enough. One must go and see the lay of the land, see, touch and feel the textures of the native plants that grow at the different pla ces, study and understand the directions and `ano or nature or manner of the wind and rain that are pili or connected to certain places, etc. All possible meanings are taken into consideration. In many cases, place names are connected not to just or there other, but to multiple meanings. Understanfing the imperative practice of taking different perspectives and views into account when processing an understanding of Hawaiian words, names and places. Literally, makawalu means, many, much, in great quantities . Sometimes used with implication of chiefly mana or energy. Literally translated it means \"eight eyes\". Makawalu is to take initiative of different Cultural Impact Assessment 12 perspectives and approaches. It is to see and observe from different angles. It is also to foster the abili ty to perceive and articulate on the interrelationships and connectedness of mankind and the natural world. Ancient Ahupua`a System: Reciprocal Relationships of Land, Environment and Man Figure 6.View of Hanalei Valley, View of Hawaiian Ahupua`a System. One of the most remarkable concepts of ancient Hawaiian culture is the basic self-sustaining structure of the ancient Ahupua`a System. Shaped by the island's geography from the mountain to the sea, each ahupua`a was divided following the natural boundaries of the watershed. Abundant rainfall along with mountain aquifers provided fresh, clean water which flowed naturally and freely through realms designated for gods and man respectively. Nourishing and supporting all life forms, water was a sacred resource and manifestation of the god, Kne to whom life and health was sanctified. The entire community took part in its proper Cultural Impact Assessment 13 care and conservation of it. The ahupua`a contained all the resources that was needed to sustain the human community. There w as the abundance of fish and seafood from the ocean, fertile lands for planting and farming upon the plains of kula lands, and timber and other resources from the upland forests for the building of structures and canoes. The success of the ahupua`a was bas ed on a belief system that emphasized Hawaiian spirituality that was extended to the entirety of the natural world which included the landscapes of land and ocean as well as the atmosphere. Nature forms that supplied nourishment and supplies for survival a nd existence were viewed as kinolau or manifestations of their deities themselves. i.e., specific plants used for healing and subsistence were body forms of certain major and minor gods because of its distinctive quality to cure or sustain. \"Ahupua'a is holistic... In Hawaiian culture, you had kahuna who knew the forests, knew the trees, knew the geology. The chiefs could draw upon the collective wisdom of the kahuna to help determine what was an appropriate construction project. Today, I see a modern ahupua'a. It means using the knowledge and tools we have today. \" \"Some argue that using an ahupua'a system today poses challenges simply because our society is not organized around subsistence, which was the whole premise of the ahupua'a system. Others h ave said, how can you use an ahupua'a system in modern Hawai'i when we import 70% of our food? Moreover, the people within the ahupua'a shared common resources, but today so many of these are now either degraded or sequestered in private lands.\" \"But if w e look at the underlying values, principles, and practices, those have not changed. Certain accepted features are retained, even in Western law: water as a public trust resource, public access rights to forest, to hiking, to gathering. Those are acknowledg ed even in modern Western laws, especially in the State of Hawai'i.\" Stephen Kubota Ahupua`a Action Alliance Stewardship Versus Ownership The concept of private land ownership was non- existent in pre- contact Hawai`i. Guided by a holistic worldview, ancient Hawaiian society was based on a subsistence economy that depended on proper stewardship of the land and resources. Tenure upon parcels of land called kuleana were extended to the maka`inn or common people to live and raise their families. Everyone shared in the stewardship of the greater ahupua`a which provided for sustainable Cultural Impact Assessment 14 gathering, fishing and hunting purposes. There was often trad ing and sharing of resources between families and villages located along the coastal areas and those within the upper regions and valleys. Trading also occurred among various ahupua`a as well. Stewardship practices were formalized through the kapu system which consisted of protocols and laws pertaining to the religious, political and cultural affairs of the chiefs and people. Overseen by konohiki chiefs and khuna (priests), regulations held in accordance with seasons and cycles. Spiritual -based kapu and r ules not only governed the use of resources, but also for their conservation and restoration as well. Knwai (laws of the land) ensured that resources were shielded from squander and exploitation. Although viewed by foreigners and the outside world as ex cessively complex and restrictive, it is one of the earliest examples of environmental protectionism. Paramount chiefs and the hierarchy of khuna or priests, were the spiritual conduits to the gods and petitioned for their success and wellbeing. Ali`i as signed konohiki to manage the ahupua`a on their behalf. The relationships were reciprocal and based on loyalty to care for, and increase the productivity of the land. Maka`inn were not indentured to serve under any particular ali`i. If commoners were mi streated unfairly, or if the ali`i was greedy, they were free to move to another ahupua`a and take up residence under another chief. I ali`i no ke ali`i i ke knaka A chief is a chief because of the people who serve him This was often used as a reminder to a chief to consider his people #531 `lelo No`eau An ali`i's success as a leader was dependent on the maka`inn. Hence, it was important that the ali`i assured their happiness to maintain their loyalty. Ultimately, both commoner and chief held the `ina in deep regard. He ali`i ka `ina, he kauw ke knaka The land is a chief, man is its servant Land has no need for man, but man needs the land and works it for a livelihood #531 `lelo No`eau Ancient Hawaiians held familial connection with nature and the environment and understood that their relationships were reciprocal. As presented in `lelo no`eau #531 above, the land was viewed as chiefly. Cultural Impact Assessment 15 Wahi Pana Wahi pana are celebrated and storied places that illuminate generations of reciprocal connection and relationships between indigenous Hawaiians and the land and seascapes and natural resources that supported their existence. For well over two thousand years, native Hawaiians have held intimate bonds with their islands and special places upo n them. Wahi pana continue to be integral, living components of a Hawaiian world view today. Literally, the word \"wahi\" simple means, \"place or location\". Pana is defined as \"celebrated and storied\" . Another definition of the word, pana is, \"heartbeat or pulse\". The latter, elevates and distinguishes a place as a wahi pana from any other ordinary location. Nature's forces, combined with the intangible spiritual energy source known to indigenous Hawaiians as mana are prevalent at many wahi pana throughout Hawai`i. Additionally, these wahi have specific stories, purpose and function that have influenced the lives of `iwi knaka or Hawai`i's native people for myriad generations. Transmitted orally from generation to generation, their experiences have been preserved through mo`olelo (legends and stories), mele oli (chants), mele hula (dances) and `oihana Hawai`i (practices), maintaining memory and knowledge of places that should be honored and respected. Wahi pana are excellent teaching tools that continue t o be extremely valuable today in its capacity to inform and demonstrate the cultural traditions, practices, values and beliefs of Hawai`i's ancestors and people. Wahi pana vary. They include, but are not limited to sacred sites such as heiau, and ancient burial caves and burial grounds. Alluvial valley floors which were cleared for the construction of elaborate irrigated systems of lo`i terraces, as well as fishing grounds and surf sites in the ocean are wahi pana as well. Mountain peaks, cliffs, valleys, rivers and streams too, have emerged over time as places of cultural importance. All discernible features in every land division, district and island were given specific names that inspired life and meaning to these places as wahi pana. Every stream, spring, beach, fishing hole, reef, promontory, winds and rains, etc. all have names. These elements of nature provided the foundation for the creative and productive industries of the ancient Hawaiians. The perpetuation of cultural practices and experienc es held in close attachment to wahi pana and the reoccurring elemental phenomena specific to places illustrate the unique relationships of stewardship and kinship by native Hawaiians and the natural environment. Cultural Impact Assessment 16 As successive generations of Hawaiians empo wered these islands and their sacred and storied places with their prayers, ceremonies and labor, they left their indelible and enduring mark on the landscape; both seen and unseen. Tangible and indefinable sources of mana or spiritual power and energy unique to different places are also a result of generations of relationships that were nurtured between mankind and these special wahi or storied places. These are the multi- faceted qualities that have elevated wahi pana to the realms of Hawaiian consciousnes s. The land, the sea, the atmosphere and all the natural resources and phenomena that were held within each of its boundaries were considered as akua, divine and sacred. All of it was godly. The proverb below, explains the concept that Hawaiians value of the reciprocal relationships of land, environment and man. E mlama pono i ka 'ina; nn mai ke ola. Take good care of the land; it grants you life. `lelo Hawai`i - The Hawaiian Language For generations, Hawai`i was immersed as an oral culture with infinite records of historic events, genealogies, ceremonies, traditions and practices that were preserved in chants, prayers, dances, and stories. Everything was committed to memory and passed on orally. Every fraction of life in ancient Hawaiian society was linked to a pantheon of deities which was accessed through a hierarchy that began with personal family gods or `aumkua, as well as gods that were specific to each vocation. Prior to the arrival of Captain James Cook and the first westerners in 1778, `lelo Hawai`i or the Hawaiian language was the only language spoken in the Hawaiian Islands. In the early 1800s, the language flourished in written form as well, after Calvinist missionaries developed a Hawaiian alphabet using Latin characters. With the enthusiastic support of the chiefs, schools were set up to provide instruction in reading and writing for Hawaiian and missionary children, adults and even business people through the medium of Hawaiian language. In less than two generations from the establ ishment of a written language, the Hawaiian Nation had the highest literacy rate of any country in the world. Hawaiian Language Newspapers The first newspaper printed in Hawai`i was a student newspaper at Lahainaluna School, called \"Ka Lama Hawai`i\" (Th e Hawaiian Luminary) on February 14, 1834. Shortly after, in that same year, the first regularly published newspaper, \"Ke Kumu Cultural Impact Assessment 17 Hawai`i\" was established. Missionaries saw these smaller newspapers as an excellent vehicle for teaching and to help with the inc rease of literacy levels, but it was also a perfect tool for promoting Christian principals. The first regular English language newspaper was founded in 1856, establishing the Pacific Commercial Advertiser as a weekly publication. The Advertiser has publ ished continuously since then, eventually producing a daily edition in 1882. Over the years, the Advertiser has gone through several name changes, including a switch to the Honolulu Advertiser in 1921. Today, the newspaper is known as the Star Advertiser. In 1861, \"Ka Hk O Ka Pakipika\" (Star of the Pacific) the first Hawaiian language newspaper published by a native Hawaiian by the name of J.K. Kaunamano was established. The press was operated entirely by a staff of native Hawaiian editors and printers w ho had been educated and trained at Lahainaluna School on Maui, as well as at the Kamehameha Schools for Boys. It was during this period that many articles and mo`olelo in the Hawaiian language flourished. From 1834 to 1948, more than 100 newspaper publications equaling approximately 125,000 pages of text in the native language were published for Hawai`i's highly literate community. Native Hawaiian authors and historians from throughout the Hawaiian chain contributed multiple genres of mo`olelo, incl uding short stories, genealogies, and lengthy epics such as the mo`olelo of Hi`iakaikapapolopele. The publications served as sources of traditional, cultural, historical and political discussions, including the decline of the native population and the need for Hawaiian sovereignty. Obituaries took the form of extensive kanikau or funerary dirges, which also included tributes of mo`ok`auhau or genealogy chants that honored the deceased. Traditional and introduced fishing practices, marine ecosystem manage ment and changing legal environments, climatic conditions, storms and so much more found their way into the volumes of Hawaiian language newspapers. Three years after the overthrow of the Hawaiian Monarchy in 1893, `lelo Hawai`i was outlawed as a language of education in Hawai`i. English quickly replaced the use of Hawaiian in schools, as well as in all government and business sectors throughout Hawai`i. Those attempting to use or perpetuate the Hawaiian language at home and in public were punished and chastised. This systematic oppression led to a steep decline in the number of native Hawaiian language speakers. For fear of being reprimanded and even ostracized by society and the authorities, parents and grandparents succumbed to the use of the English language in the raising of their children and families. Many forms of Hawaiian expression, practices and custom were heavily prohibited and punishable by law. Many kumu hula, `olohe, kahuna l`au lapa`au and other masters of traditional schools of knowledge ceased to teach and practice. Several went underground Cultural Impact Assessment 18 with their traditions or kept their practices limited to their immediate family members. By the early 1980s, less than 30 children under the age of 12 could speak Hawaiian. Most were children of paren ts from Ni`ihau - the only island remaining where Hawaiian language was spoken as the first and preferred language of choice. Parent and grandparent generations elsewhere in Hawai`i had already grown up without knowledge or experience in speaking the Hawaiian language. For majority of the native population in Hawai`i, `lelo Hawai`i was as remote and unfamiliar as any other foreign language from another country. In 1978, the State of Hawai`i Constitution was amended to recognize Hawaiian as an official lan guage of Hawai`i by law. Today, the language is beginning to flourish once again, with Hawaiian charter schools, pre- schools and public schools providing instruction in `lelo Hawai`i. Mo`olelo: Storied Origins & Traditional Places Mo`o `lelo is the succession of talk; or the continuation and perpetuation of oral histories and traditions that were passed on in story and chant forms. It is from this that the word mo`olelo is derived - stories, tales, myths, legends and chronicles; records of informati on that was storied in the memories of Hawai`i's ancient people. Another term that is used is k`ao - oral traditions and myths that represent the cultural truths, wisdom and experiences of our kpuna. Throughout the CIA, examples of traditional Hawaiian mo`olelo are presented to link the reader with traditional places, beliefs and practices associated with the ancestral worldview of Hawai`i's indigenous Hawaiian people. Mo`olelo and k`ao are not viewed as fanciful fairy tales or fictional stories woven to entertain. Laden with skillful use of metaphors and poetic expressions, they are invaluable sources of information that have preserved a sense of consciousness and inner connection of the knaka `iwi with his multidimensional world. It is estimated th at the Hawaiian island chain was first settled upon more than 2000 years ago by Polynesians who arrived from Nukuhiwa (also pronounced Nu`uhiwa) or the Marquesas Islands. Early migration chants and oral traditions provide insight to the discovery and settl ing upon these islands. One story tells of a man named Hawai`iloa who is credited with first discovering Hawai`i when he set out from a land called, \"Ka `ina kai melemele a Kne, ( The land of the yellow sea of Kne ) on a long fishing expedition. He sails back to his homeland and returns with his wife and followers, including eight navigators. Because his wife is the only female on this return journey, it is said that all Hawaiians are descended Cultural Impact Assessment 19 from him. The largest island in the chain - Hawai`i, is name d in his honor, while the additional islands of Kaua`i, Maui and O`ahu are named after his children. From Hawai`iloa, the heritage of long, distant voyaging, non -instrument navigation and way finding is established using phenomenal skills of keen observat ion and comprehension of stars and constellations in the heavens. He is the primal ancestor of the Hawaiian people who also introduces the astronomical wisdom of the atmosphere and its phenomena, including the weather and climate. He is also an expert of t he ancient sciences associated with the physical, geological and biological features of the oceans. From the union of Papahnaumoku and Wkea - preeminent mkua or parents of the Hawaiian universe is born Hloa...our very connection to kalo, the sacred staple that has fed and nourished the Hawaiian people since time immemorial. The genealogical ko`ihonua of Hawai`i's ancestral Earth Mother and Sky Father bring forth the paradigm that bind generations of Native Hawaiian families to this storied progenitor. Through the traditions of Papa and Wkea, the energy of the Hawaiian family system that includes both nuclear and extended `ohana is born. From this legacy comes the skills and intelligence of the mahi`ai - the native planter that tends to Hlo a, the taro plant and elder brother that continues to sustain families today. Indigenous agriculture and cultivation practices are dependent on acquiring intimate knowledge of water cycles, moon phases and weather phenomena. There is a constant nurturing o f familial relationships to land, environment and elements of the Hawaiian universe. The epic saga of Pelehonuamea describe in detail, the journey of the fire clan aboard the mythical wa`a (canoe) named Honuaikea. Their quest is to search for a new fire source and a home from which to generate sources of life. It too, is a story of genealogy and migration, establishing cyclical movements of life upon these lands. The sun is a fundamental and reoccurring theme of substance that is essential to physical, spiritual and intellectual wellbeing. The chants of the mo`olelo of Pele and Hi`iaka provide detailed accounts that speak to the importance of relationships that the indigenous Hawaiian hold in high esteem with `ohana or familial relationships; not just with mankind, but with their environment as well as with that of the atmosphere and the elements. This is a profound expression of connection that taps into the inner sources of life and healing. Through this ancient oral tradition, we are provided with fo rmulas and procedures of Hawaiian protocols and ceremonies that are still applicable for the native Hawaiian in the 21st century. These are just a few examples of the incalculable volumes of \"unwritten literature\" Cultural Impact Assessment 20 - primal sources of Hawaiian chants and t he impressive accounts within them chronicle centuries of Hawai`i's fascinating history and culture. Embedded in the narratives of these ancient traditions are valuable details that provide us with a deeper understanding and a closer look at the worldview, life ways and experiences of Hawai`i's people prior to the turbulent changes that unfolded in post-contact times. The significance and merit of mo`o `lelo - what an ingenious tradition of transmitting wisdom, knowledge, history and more through the succ ession of the voice conveyed through the telling of stories and the perpetuation of the art form of chants and the oral traditions that inspire the essence of indigenous Hawaiian cultural practices and beliefs. Ancient Chants that Extol the Land & Environment as Relations References and examples of chants from Hawai`i's ancient repository of oral and literary traditions have been included in this CIA to elaborate upon the traditional beliefs and cultural practices of native Hawaiians. These practices con tinue to this day. Mele oli, mele pule, mele hula and mo`olelo provide authentic examples of this continuing practices. They also speak to the relationships held between n knaka - mankind, their environment and their gods. The ancients viewed facets of nature such as the heavens and earth as a godly and divine pairing of male and female procreative energies. Wkea - the broad, wide expanse of the atmosphere is male. The moisture that gathers and collects in the clouds and sky produces rain, which is also a male force. The earth is female, and is known to Hawaiians as Papahnaumoku, or literally, Papa that gives birth to islands. Adapted from Hawaiian Antiquities by David Malo (p.243) the mele ko`ihonua or genealogical chant on the following page speaks t o the birthing of the Hawaiian Islands. Wkea - the male, is embodied in the expanse of the atmosphere and the heavens. Papahnaumoku - the female is Papa who gives birth (hnau) to islands. This ancient chant was r evived into modern day cultural practice as a means of expressing native Hawaiians' familial relationship with the natural world and the `ina or land. Papa and Wkea - Sky Father and Earth Mother, along with their offspring, Ho`ohklani are the divine characters and procreative forces that are also revered for the gift and traditions of the sacred kalo or taro plant. They are viewed and respected as ancestral progenitors of native Hawaiians. `O Wkea noho ia Papahnaumoku islands Begotten was Hawai'i, an island Begotten was Maui, an island Wakea made a new departure And lived with Ho'ohkkalani Begotten was Moloka'i, an island Begotten was Lna'i, an island The womb of Papa became jealous at its partnership with Ho'ohkkalani Papa returned and lived with Wkea Begotten was O'ahu, an island Begotten was Kaua'i, an island Begotten was Ni'ihau, an island A red rock was Kaho'olawe! Cultural Impact Assessment 22 The significance and understanding of mana as physical, mental and spiritual nourishment is preeminent in the customs of old Hawai`i. It is essential to the health and wellbeing of the family system and community. Every fragment of Hawaiian history and c ulture was documented to memory and orally transmitted from one generation to the next via chants. The births of gods, mankind, celebrated chiefs and more were often the subjects of lengthy, detailed chants. Amongst them were mele mo`ok`auhau or genealogy chants, which are still considered to be one of the most prized family possessions of the native Hawaiian people. Kpuna or elders were careful to designate individuals in the following generations of their families to be groomed as stewards of t he `ohana's genealogy. All knowledge was committed to memory, which included the names, unions and offspring in the family's ancestors. Mo`ok`auhau hold us accountable to our ancestors. It strengthens our cultural identity and inspires the mana of our bei ng. However, mo`ok`auhau were not limited to families of humans only. Literary accounts of mo`ok`auhau also included family lines of many other nature forms as well. This included, mountains, sharks, water sources and elements of the natural world. The following is short segment from a chant that names the Kaikahinali`i - the female and Knehoalani - the male, as the elemental parents of their nature offspring. `O Kaikahinali`i, ka makuahine; `O mother was Kaikahinali`i The father was Knehoalani Their children born to them and the sands of their birth First born was Kamohoali`i - a male, he was born at Hapakuela Kahuilaokalani - a male was born, he was born at Hapakuela Pelehonuamea - a female was born, she too was born at Hapakuela The lines above provide a genealogical introduction associated with a Cultural Impact Assessment 23 migration made to the island of Kanaloa (another name for Kaho`olawe). It speaks of natural phenomena and the interrelationships of male and female procreative forces that produce godly offspring. The mother is Kaikahinali`i who is the originating volcanic source of seismic movements that produces tsunami activity in the ocean. Knehoalani is the father whose atmospheric form is the sun. Their combined male and female energies give birth to the first three offspring in this genealogy; namely, Kamohoali`i, Kahuilaokalani and Pelehonuamea. Kamohoali`i (the supreme principal chief) is the hiapo - the eldest and the first born who is the leader and principal that guides the migration of the Pele Clan and is responsible for initiating volcanic eruptions. In one of his primordial ocean forms, he is a great shark god. He is the master navigator aboard the Pele Clan's mythical canoe named Honuaikea (the expanse of the earth). Kahuilaokalani (the lightning of the heavens) is also a male who takes on the form of the electrical currents in the atmosphere. Born from the eyes of Haumea, he is manifested through flashing lightning. Pelehonuamea (Red-hot magma from the earth) is female. She is the substance of molten magma and the flow of lava, responsible for the creation of new land. As the goddess of fire and volcanoes, Pele influences movement upon the earth as well as in the atmosphere. Her discernible attributes include earthquakes, wind, steam, smoke, and fire. All five of these characters are imperative to the migration of the Pele clan in their quest to search for a new fire source. They all possess mana - physical and spiritual energy to initiate earthquakes, eruptions, lightning, thunder , tsunamis and the flow of magma and lava that eventually cools and hardens. This is the procreative process of male and female nature gods credited with the birthing of new land. The chant, \"K Mkou E Hele\" details the migration journey aboard the canoe, Honuaikea. Entering from the northwest end of the Hawaiian Island chain, the Fire clan stops at each of the islands with hopes that Pele will be able to establish a home for them. The chant begins with their first landing at the island of Nhoa, a land rugged and inhospitable for living. They move on to the island of Lehua, where they discover that they unintentionally left their brother Kneapua behind at Nhoa. It is here, that the chant describes the masterful skills of Kamohoali`i as a steersman and navigator who is challenged to maneuver their canoe to return Cultural Impact Assessment 24 to Nhoa where their brother Kneapua has been left behind. From there they head to Ni`ihau. Kamohoali`i consults Paoa, the divine staff of Ni`ihau's potential for them to build a home there. However, it proves the t errain unfavorable and the fire clan continues to Kaua`i. Their stay on Kaua`i is brief at the northern tip of Klauea where eventually, Pele's volcanic fires are put out by the raging ocean of her rival sibling and older sister, Namakaokaha`i. From Klauea, they head to the south end of Kaua`i where Pele makes another attempt to create a home in the moku district of Kona (today known as the Kloa district). Again, her fires are put out by the goddess of the sea. Situated on Makao kaha`i Point, the ocean- filled spatter cone dug by Pele is called, Nomilu, named for the deity and the realm of the underworld. This is part of the Kloa eruption series, Kaua`i's last volcanic activity. Eventually, the fire clan reaches their destination on Hawai`i Island at the cape known as, Kumukahi (First Beginnings). Kumukahi is named after an ancient hero of Kahiki who first landed there. Contrary to the common thought that Kahiki is Tahiti in the Hawaiian language, it is described in mo`olelo and c hants as a far away, distant land from whence the ancient gods originated from. Hiki meaning to get to or to reach a place; arrive, appear and arise . Kahiki was also the term used to identify the five stratums that divided the sky. The use of these terms is also important in religious ceremonies to establish the perimeters of sacred ceremonial space which extended to, and included the greater atmosphere of the universe. The dome of heaven was a structure, with walls that rested upon the earth. The different kahiki represent the boundaries of this paradigm. Kahiki -moe - Horizon. Literally, prostrate Kahiki Kahiki -k - sky just above the horizon. Literally, upright Kahiki. Kahiki -ka-papa- nu`u - the next elevated stratum. Kahiki -kapu- i-Hlani -ke-k`ina - the sky directly overhead. Literally, sacred Kahiki at Hlani the meeting place. Legend tells of Kumukahi and his wives, represented by volcanic pillars along the coast who tossed the sun back and forth. The mo`olelo descr ibes the fundamental nature of the movement of the sun between the solstices as it moves from one extremity to the other from north to south. Another account by Martha Beckwith describes a red stone at the extreme end of the cape that represents the Kmukahi, a god with healing powers who can take the form of a klea or plover. Two further stones represent his wives, who \"manipulate the seasons by pushing the sun back and forth between them at the two solstices\" (Beckwith 1970 [1940], p.119). Cultural Impact Assessment 25 It seem s likely the most proverbial sayings associated with Hanalei are references to the rains. One is simply Ka ua loku o Hanalei (\"The pouring rain of Hanalei\") Hanalei i i ka noe o Alaka'i (\"Heavily weighted is Hanalei in the pouring rain; laden down by the mist of Alaka'i\") (Pukui 1983:170). Pukui explains the poetic meaning: \"An expression used in dirges and chants of woe to express the burden of sadness, the heaviness of grief, and tears pouring freel y like rain. Rains and fogs of other localities may also be used.\" Pukui the poetical 'ale nei ka wai. (\"Tear up the birds, the water is surging\") with Hanalei. She explains: Let us hurry, as there is no t ime for niceties. Kane'alohi and his son lived near the lake of Halulu at Wai'ale'ale, Kaua'i. They were catchers of 'ua'u birds. Someone falsely accused them of poaching on land belonging to the chief of Hanalei, who sent a large company of warriors to de stroy them. The son noticed agitation in the water of Halulu and cried out a warning to his father, who tore the birds to hasten cooking. Another legend regarding Haehae- ka-manu -a-Kne'alohi- ke-'ale-mai-nei-ka- wai, a peak near the Wai'ale'ale, Wichman (1998:109) relates the following account: Kne'alohi, a bird catcher, lived in this part of the mountains with his nephew Lauhaka. Their camp was on the cliff side of the Alaka'i Swamp beside an open bit of water. The water of this pool rippled whenever anyone stepped into the swamp miles away. Inadvertently, they were breaking the new rules of Kalknehina, the Waimea chief, who had forbidden the catching of 'ua'u birds, the dark -rumped petrel, which was good eating. Kalknehina sent some warrior s to kill the two birdcatchers, but they were warned by the rippling water as they broiled a petrel over the fire. Lauhaka called out to his uncle to tear the bird apart so they could eat it before the warriors reached them - hence the name. A last poet ic saying Me'e u'i o Hanalei (\"The handsome hero of Hanalei\") \"said of one who is attractive\") would seem to be a clear reference to Kauahoa (Pukui 1983:234) (reference the Legends of Kawelo below). The Story of Lonoikamakahiki In the Story of Lonoika makahiki, (Fornander 1919 Vol. IV Part II: the ruling chief Lonokamakahiki and Kaikilani chant similar chants about various places in Hawai'i nei including a reference to the rains of Hanalei: O Hanalei kumu a ka ua Hanalei, The source o f the rains I amo a haahaa Made low from carrying such a burden Kapaihiahilina also chants of his wanderings at Hanalei with Lonokamakahiki Cultural Impact Assessment 26 also focusing on the rains: My companion of the tall pandanus...He hoa i la, The pandanus that had been pecked by birds, O ka hala i 'aina kepa ia e ka manu, Hanalei, O P'ok i Hanalei- la Thus did we two wander along my companion, Hala ia mao a ka ua, e ke hoa-e Through the heavy and wind -blown rain, He ua ka'e'e, ua makani, The ceaseless and general rain.

The following is a list of legends about the area condensed from Hammatt, Hallett H., David W. Shideler and Nancy A. McMahon ( 2011 ). Legend of Kaipalaoa In 1919 Vol. IV 576- 577) the boy hero arrives at Hanalei by sea from Pka' O'ahu in the retinue of the ruling chief of Kaua'i, Pueonuiokona. They meet two canoes of the chief returning with fish and the boy requests some fish. He chooses two relatively small insignificant fish, an Oililepa (file- fish) a nd a Kikakapu (butterfly - fish) which figure later in his contest of wits at Wailua. Cultural Impact Assessment 27 Kawelo and Hanalei In the Legend of Kawelo, (Fornander 1919 Vol. V Part I: 576 -577) the Kaua'i hero was brought up with a certain kinsman, the giant Kauahoa of Hanale i who would become the most noted warrior of the ruling chief 'Aikanaka. In a sidebar, while fishing from a canoe for uhu (parrotfish) at Kaena O'ahu, Kawelo caught the demi -god Uhumakaikai in his net and was towed close to Hanalei where his companion, Maa kuakeke, asked for that land. Kawelo returns to Kaua'i to fight against the ruling chief 'Aikanaka and the great warrior Kauahoa. The fighting breaks out at Wailua. Aloha for Kauahoa arose within Kawelo and he tries to avoid a fight with his kinsman (hoaha nau) from his childhood by trying to win over Kauahoa with a flowery chant, referring to Kauahoa repeatedly as \"the pride of Hanalei\" (ka ui o Hanalei). There are several references to Hanalei: \"swollen and enlarged is the moss of Hanalei\" (Pehu kaha ka limu o Hanalei). \"Hanalei, the cold land, the wet land, the land the end is\" (Hanalei aina anuanu, aina the land of rain\" (O Hanalei aina ua). Kawelo appears to evoke images of the Hanalei landscape: For the anger of Honokoa is reviling, Maewa ana ka ukiukiu o Honokoa At the cliff of Kalehuawehe, I ka pali o Kalehuawehe Where the lama and wiliwili bloom, Pua ka lama me ka wiliwili Where the rain sweeps on the outside, O ka ua lele ma waho of Mamala hoaO Mamalahoa Kauahoa o his overtures of peace and Kawelo then turned to one of his wives, Kanewahineikiaoha and chants: Say, Kanewahineikiaoha, E Kanewahineikiaoha e; your pikoi (tripping club) throw it up, Ko pakoi hoolei ia i luna At Helelua, at Helelua, I Helelua, i Helelua At the ridge- I kaupoku o Hanalei la. Arise e Hanalei e Until Kauahoa thou thou shalt possess, Aahu ae i birds of Kaula thou shalt oe i (Fornander 1919 Vol. V In of Kawelo (Fornander 1919 Vol. V Part III: 694- 707) Kauahoa is actually the elder brother of Kawelo, born of the same parents, but adopted by Haulili, the \"great one\" of Hanalei (Haulii, ka mea nui o Hanalei). Kauahoa comes from Hanalei and is referred to as \"The champion of Hanalei' (Ke Cultural Impact Assessment 28 kamaeu o Hanalei). In Pukui's (1951:117- 118, 122) account, following the killing of Kauahoa, Kawelo lived with his wife in Hanalei planting.\" Wichman (1998:111) relates the following: \"Hanalei was the home of Kauahoa, a warrior who lived about 1690. He was the last of the great giant kupua warriors, noted for his strength, size, and because he was handsome. He was born on the same day and in the same place as the future ruling chief, 'Aikanaka, and his cousin Kaweloleimakua. In the war between these two, 'Aikanaka did not immediately call upon Kauahoa, who angrily sat in the headwaters of the Hanalei River and dammed up the water for so long that the f ish gasped in the dry bottom....Kauahoa is often referred to as Kame'eu'io Hanalei, \"handsome hero of Hanalei,\" and this name was given to a headland in his memory.\" Legend of Palila In the Legend of Palila, (Fornander 1919 Vol. V Part I: 138 -141) th ere is a reference to a club fighting hero of Hanalei named Lupeakawaiowainiha It was said that every time he urinated the land would be flooded. Legend of Kapunohu In the Legend of Kapunohu, the Kaua'i hero became ruling chief of Kaua'i by throwing his ihe spear from Koloa through the ridge at Anahola leaving a perforation (puka), with it finally slowing as it passed over Kalihikai and falling to earth at Hanalei (Fornander 1919 Vol. V Part I: 224 -225). Legend of Kamapua'a In the Legend of Kamapua'a, the pig child delivers a chant in his anger describing the sea account of Kamapua'a Hanalei as follows: \"Courage came back to them [the people of Kaua'i], and at Hanalei the people forced him [Kamapua'a] into a corner, and, carrying stones, tried to fence him in, but he broke the walls down, tore his way through the people and fled. The high chief of Hanalei threw his magic spear at him as he sushed past, but missed him. The spear struck the mountainside near the summit and passed through, leaving a great hole through which the sky on the other side of the mountain can still be seen.\" Skinner (1900:229) relates the following account of Kamapua'a at Hanalei: \"So ill did he behave in Kaua'i, assailing innocent people and destroying their taro patches, that they determined to dispatch him, and in order to Cultural Impact Assessment 29 have him under their advantage it was resolved to fence him in near Hanalei. The wall of mountain now existing there is the fence. Just before it was finished the prince in charge of the work sat to rest in a gap which admits the present road. He heard a harsh laugh, and looking up saw Kamapua'a sitting on the top of Hoary Head. A running fight ensued, in which the outlaw escaped across the mountain, and the prince, hurling his spear, but missing his mark, sent the weapon through the crest of the peak, making the remarkable window that is one of the sights of the isla nd.\" Story of Halali'i In the Story of Halali'i, the king of the ghosts of O'ahu, there was a time when O'ahu was inhabited only by ghosts. The sole Kaua'i survivor of an act of treachery by the O'ahu ghosts sails to Hanalei and finds the ruling chief of Kaua'i at that place (Fornander 1919 Vol. V Part II: 432- 433). With the aid of his kahuna, Namalokama he devises a plan to defeat the O'ahu ghosts. Story of the 'helo In the Story of the 'helo, (Fornander 1919 Vol. V Part III: 580 -581) the origin of the 'helo plant is traced to the daughter of a certain Maunakepa: The moss peoples the barren lands Ka limu kaha of Maunakepao Maunakepa Spattering thereon i luna ka ua from Hanalei, etc. O Hanalei, a pela aku. Legend of the lovers Pa'alua and Kawelu In the Legend of the lovers Pa'alua and Kawelu, (Thrum 1923:139) Pa'alua regales the daughter of the ruling chief of O'ahu with accounts of \"the charms of his home in the vale of Hanalei\" referring to the home of his father, the ruling chief of Kaua'i. He makes specific reference to the kamani and olond that grow in the valley of account me to Hanalei.\" They become the rulers of Kaua'i and Ni'ihau. A Maiden from the Mu In \"A Maiden from the Mu\" a young chief of Hanalei organizes a pig -hunt in Wainiha in search of the daughter of a Hawaiian bird catcher and a M wahine (Pukui 1951: 72). Legend of Kalelealuaka In the Legend of Kalelealuaka (Thrum 1907: 84), the hero of that name goes to Hanalei and defeats a resident chief of great strength in a contest of accuracy in throwing spears at a banana trunk. Cultural Impact Assessment 30 Account of Kawelu In Knudsen's (1956:83) account of Kawelu, the Shark Go d, the man- eating demi- god of Wailua is said to also frequent Hanalei River. Village Belle of Poki'i In Knudsen's (1956:93) account of the \"Village Belle of Poki'i\", the beauty is betrothed to a man who lives in Hanalei Valley \"and is very rich, with large taro lands and many horses.\" Ka'awak Heiau Regarding Ka'awak Heiau account: \"The kilo i'a (fish watcher) of the M would go to Ka'awak at the completion of an 'o'opu fish trap. Here he would make a shrine, present an offering of 'awa, bananas and kumu taro. Then he would make a cup of olon leaves and would chant. This completed the ritual over the fish trap, which he then would close and the fish would be caught.\" MELE HO`LA are chants that are used for pre -dawn preparations and ceremonies. It provides for proper address of the elements, the cardinal points and boundaries of the greater universe. Most importantly, it is a chant that is offered in greeting . It is also a chant that was used to gently awaken a chief or chiefess from his or her slumber. It was commonplace to initiate the start of the day in prayer, meditation and chant . Chanting continues to be a primary course of communicating with the natural world and el ements such as the sun. The thought and intention embedded in the poetry of the chant/prayer, coupled with the energy and vibration of the chanters' voice is at the very basis of the simplest expression of worship. `papa is also used to denote rank and st atus of gods and chiefs; thus, exalting the sun and the elements of the heavens as the epitome of divine order. The Project Area and Hanalei Ahupua`a No previous archaeological studies have been conducted in the subject property . There are over twenty studies in the great Hanalei area. These studies are summarized in McMahon (2017). Bennett's records of 1931 described several heiau around Hanalei. However, he did not identify a heiau within the vicinity of the project area. The f irst comprehensive study of the archaeology of Kaua'i was undertaken by Wendell C. Bennett (1931) based on field work accomplished in Cultural Impact Assessment 31 1928 and 1929. Bennett recorded four sites in Hanalei Ahupua'a and two Pu'u Maheu, Kalihikai, is a paved platform 18 by 21 feet on top of Maheu peak. There is a fine view of the valley and country all around. River stone as well as local rock is used in its paving. Site 139: P'ok Heiau, on the east bluff of Hanalei valley a short distance from the government road on a knoll marked on the map as \"Po oku.\"Only a few stones remain to mark the location of this heiau which Thrum [1906:43] describes as \"An unenclosed heiau of about two acres in area. Of luakini class, terraced d own on all sides from the central platform.\" Site 140: Kapaka Heiau, on top of Kapaka hill on the east bluff of Hanalei valley just within the forest line. Thrum describes this structure as \"A paved open platform heiau without walls; stones set edgewise traversing through. Kane its deity. Said to have had connection with Kapinao at Waiakalua in its workings.\" This site has had many stones removed, or covered over with vegetation. The river stones seem to cover the top of the hill for a diameter of about 7 5 feet. The extent of the heiau could not be accurately determined. The stones set edgewise traversing through could not be found. Site 141: Heiau and house sites, at Kalama -iki, an old village on the river flats, four miles up Hanalei Valley. There is a stone structure 18 by 20 foot with walls all around 2.5 feet wide and 2 feet high. In front is a paved section extending 5 feet, like a lanai, to a drop of 4 feet to the river terrace. The river is 50 feet out in front. Both river stones and rough rocks w ere used, but no coral was seen. The wall was chinked with smaller stones in front. Taro terraces and house sites are on the plains along the river. Site 142: Kaapoku Heiau, inland from Site 141 in Hanalei Valley. This small shrine consists of a 18 by 20 foot platform made of rough stones. A village was across the stream. Site 143: Ditch and house sites, across the river from Site 142 in Hanalei Valley. Site also includes taro terraces and a ditch that runs from 0.5 mile or so up the stream to water this plain. The water comes through a big rock which is conveniently cracked. The legend reads that Pele sent lightning to split the rock so that the people could get the water down to the fields. Upstream from here a large, overhanging rock forms a natural s helter. It has been built up along the front a bit. The house sites of the solidly paved type, as well as those merely outlined with stones, are found (Bennett 1931:134 -35). Cultural Impact Assessment 32 Field investigations of the Project Area Hawaiian Religious & Cultural Practices, Gathering Rights Field investigations of the project area resulted in no evidence or findings of significant plants or natural resources that are associated with Hawaiian gathering rights for subsistence, cultural or religious practices. The pr oject area is overgrown with many non-native v egetation . One historic property was found, after one informant stated that at the point above Route 560 there is a heiau and he pointed out a wall and some other scattered stones. During the archaeologica field work, a pre -contact historic property which included a wall, two stone mounds and a scattered of stones surrounding the mounds were found (EAL #2, McMahon 2017). EAL is still uncertain of the function of this pre-contact historic property. Informants have stated a heiau. Another informant s tated it was an ahu. One informant suggested could this have to do with the Russian Fort, Fort Barc lay that has never been located. Couple of informants stated that they were told by their parents to stay away from this property. So, their assumption is the land was sacred. Another informant said her husband also said to stay away from this parcel. So, the function and use of this historic property is not very clear . State Inventory of Historic Properties ( SIHP)# 50-30-03-02354 will not be affected by the development of the single- family residence and will be preserved. Perhaps here the cultural defini tion is more appropriate as wahi kapu (sacred place) . It gives you that sense of a sacred place with its views reaching out across the Hanalei Bay to Haena Point to looking back at Po oku. In postulating the purpose of SIHP# 50 -30-03-02354, alignments are a possibily. Stone markers or altars are used to track the movement of the sun and its entry point upon the horizon throughout the year. They are especially significant during the vernal and autumnal equinoxes as well as the summer and winter solstices. They are used in the same capacity of measuring time and sun observations. Research on sun chants and mo olelo are abundant, but none were found for this ridge in Hanalei. Maybe in pre- contact times, this location had another name, but was forgotten or forbidden to use and now not know. SIHP# 50 -30-03-02354 does align with Po oku Heaiu which is to the southeast . Perhaps when the sun set between the two cairns, it is signifying some important time frame like the makahiki season? These are areas where further rearch is needed. Native Hawaiian informants that were interviewed for this study indicated that the project area was unsuitable for subsistence gathering purposes in its present state (thick non- Native vegetation) and perhaps with a business highway ( Route 560) surrounding most of the parcel . There is also t he long history of large- scale commercial cultivati on, roads, electric power transfer station and clusters of homes and office buildings that could easily have obliterated any cultural or Cultural Impact Assessment 33 religious sites that may have previously existed in the area. Much of the project area was covered by strawberry guava (Psidium cattleianum ) scrubland. B etween the highway and the s teep slopes is a closed or nearly closed canopy forest of mostly introduced tree species: common in this area are \"native\"1. EAL's field inspections resulted in the findings of only three native Hawaiian plant species. The plants recorded include: hala (Pandanus tectorius) , . botantical survey was conducted by Guinter and 2017 which stated four of the 12 species of ferns identified are native species (indigenous or endemic species). Among the flowering plants, 6 indigenous (5%) and no endemic s are listed. Early Polynesian introductions total 5 (4%). The property does support many old Hala trees that provide an ambiance of a Hawaiian sense of place, but the entire ridge has also several Hala trees. Making the ridge itself in its entirety a sac red place. Below is a listing of the native pants found on the property and possible cultural uses: Uluhe (Dicranopteris linearis (Burm. f.) is the false stghorn fern. An early pioneer species on landslides and eroded areas (Valier 1995:26). It is u sed in lei (McDonald 1989:26). Cultural Impact Assessment 34 Figure 7. Uluhe fern. Moa (Psilotum nudum (L.) P. Beauv ) is the upright whisk fern, Native Hawaiians use d the branched stem in children's game called 'moa nahele' (cock fighting), winner would announce victory by crowing like a rooster (Krauss 1993:88). Spores used like talcum powder (Valier 1995:4) . Cultural Impact Assessment 35 Figure Moa fern Koali'awa (Ipomoea indica (J. Burm.) Merr. ) is a vine. All parts used as purgative; stems/leaves crushed as a poultice for wounds and sores. Juice of roots, leaves, stem and flowers used as a laxative, and in treating broken bones, used along with a k (ti, Cordyline fruticosa ) leaf to protect the skin (Abbott 1992:100). Cultural Impact Assessment 36 Figure 9. Koali'awa Kukui (Aleurites moluccana (L.) Wild. ), called the candlenut tree. T he entire tree had many nonmedical uses in everyday life. The kukui tree' s most prominent use in ancient awaii was as a source of light. The oil within each nut provided at least 3 minutes of light. The kukui tree also had a myriad of other uses: Canoes were made from the trunk; various dyes were obtained from the root, bark, and burned nut ; polish, paints, and varnishes were made from the oil; fo od an d condiments were provided by the roasted nut; ornaments (le is) and entertainment (spinning tops) were created fro m the fruit; and medicines were derived from the leaves, flowers, bark, and nut. Medicinal uses include chewed kukui flowers, would heal thrus h (candidiasis), and the edible raw nut was used as a laxative. Kukui was used to treat co nstipation, wounds, infections, asthma, sore throat, arthriti s, and numerous skin disorders, and other conditions . Cultural Impact Assessment 37 Figure 10. K ukui Ka'e'e (Mucuna gigantea ( Willd.) DC. ) sea bean. The meat of the seed is used as a laxative. 'Ulu (Artocarpus altilis (Z.) Fosberg ), is called breadfruit. It was used to treat koko'ino (bad blood), one can combine the bark of 'ulu with that with the flowers and leaves of ko'oko'olau (Bidens spp.); these items are mixed into a liquid form and to be taken three times daily (Chun 1992:38- 39). 'Ulu, especially the sap, is used as a secondary ingredient in numerou s other remedies . Large fruit eaten and made into poi (Abbott 1992:35: Malo 1951:21); sweet dish made from ulu and and coconut (niu) cream (Krauss 1993:11). It i s said that the original ulu maika was disk cut from immature breadfruit (Krauss 1993:94). The lightweight wood used for drums (pahu) (Abbott 1992:119), surfboards Cultural Impact Assessment 38 (papa ku'i 'ai) (Krauss 1993:18). Inner bark fibers for a low -grade kapa (Abbott 1992:51; Malo 1951:48). A yellow -brown dye is made from male flowers (Krauss 1993:67); sap for birdlime and leaves as sandpaper (Handy et al . 192:154); used on hula altars (kuahu) (Emerson 1909:20). Sap as gum from stem chewed by children, and also used as glue to join gourds to make ipu heke (Handy et al. 1972:154). Pkahakaha (Lepisorus fruticosa (L.) A. Chev. ) is commonly called ti. K has many medicinal uses. For treatment of i'aku o ka ihu (nasal growth) k flowers are combined with rhizomes h a n o ( h o ) m a k a ' u i k e k a n a k a , k flowers are added to pith of internally with poi and other foods. Treatment for shortness of breath/asthma (nae, nae'oiku, nae hokale 'ano ohaohao) k flowers and buds 'uhaloa root bark and k kea (white sugarcane, Saccharum officinarum). For phlegm in the chest, umauma hihia pa'akiki i ka male, leaves and leaf bud s of the k is mixed with 'uala, to cause vomiting. For the illness wela hou 'ole o ke kino (absence of perspiration), k leaves are wrapped about the head and chest. For illnesses such as hinanawe, hopilo, wai'opua, (classes of kohepopo?), the leaves are stripped and worn as a lei. The treatment for nae'oiku and wai'opua and similar classes of kohepopo illnesses, the leaf buds of the k are combined with 'ala'ala wai nui pehu, the aerial roots of the hala ( Pandanus buds from noni fruit, and k kea. Many uses, including leaves as food wrappers in imu and for footwear; the sweet roots baked as a \"treat or famine food\"; in historic period distilled into alcoholic beverage, 'okolehao (Handy et al. 1972:222-225). The earliest account of k use come from the late eighteenth century (Cpt. Portlock 1789), who says that sweet potatoes, taro, sugarcane, yams and \"tee\" were \"met in great abundance\". Abbott suggests that the term \"famine food\" for k may be inappropriate, and says perhaps it was more commonly consumed (1992:41- 42). Commonly cooked and eaten in many other island groups, such as New Zealand, Samoa, Society Islands (Pollock 1992). It is of note that Portlock made beer from the boiled roots for curing scurvy, Cultural Impact Assessment 39 it is possible that this was a forerunner of 'okolehau, which is distilled in iron pots, hence the name \"iron bottom\". Degener says that the Hawaiians brewed beverages of low alcoholic cont ent from k, 'uala, & k prior to haole arrival, and that before 1800 they were taught to distill k by some convicts from Botany Bay, Australia (1930:97). Hillebrand (1888:442) may be the source of this idea --he notes that the natives understood how to make a kind of beer, and later learned to distill it. The leaves are use d as thatch, rain capes, symbols of status, plates, instruments, & cups; the stem is used in divining (Handy et al. 1972:222- 225). Used on hula altars (kuahu) (Emerson 1909:20). Leaves used as healing apparatus, not as medicines themselves: they were wrapp ed around warm stones to serve as hot packs, used in poultices, and applied to fevered octovalvis (Jacq.) Raven . No Hawaiian name is yet known for this plant. Non-native plants contribute to the heavy ove rgrowth of vegetation throughout the project site; all of which are not associated with any traditional or contemporary Hawaiian cultural practices. All birds observed are non native species. The Hawaiian Goose or nn (Branta sandvicensis) is common in nearby Hanalei NWR. O ne day two nene were found in the project area. No mammals nor signs of their presence were detected on the subject property during the survey. Wild pigs have been observed to wander and forage in the area in the past. Two informants stated that the area was known for pig hunting. One had actually hunted there with his father. While there are other sites and hunting grounds elsewhere that are considered more favorable, local hunters have pursued wild pigs to support their cultural subsistence practices which help to feed their families. According to researchers, Charles Burrows, President of 'Ahahui Mlama I Ka Lkahi, Charles Isaacs I Ka Lkahi, and Maly, Cultural Histori an & Resource Specialist, Kumo Pono Associates (2007), it is well documented that feral pigs ranging through Hawai'i's upland forests today bear little physical or cultural resemblance to the smaller, domesticated pigs brought to the islands by voyaging Po lynesians. It remains a popular misconception that pigs are native to Hawaiian forests and that pig hunting was a common practice in ancient Hawai'i. The article completed by the researchers mentioned above titled, Pua'a (pigs) in Hawai'i, from Traditional to Modern compares the traditional role of pigs in Hawaiian culture: Pigs are not native to Hawai'i. The first pigs were brought to the Hawaiian Islands by Polynesians as early as the fourth century A.D. Skeletal remains of pigs and recorded traditional k nowledge sources indicate that pua'a (the Cultural Impact Assessment 40 Polyesian pig) was a much smaller animal t han the feral pigs of today . Originally, pua'a enjoyed a close relationship with their human families and rarely strayed far from the kauhale (family compound) . Well develo ped taro and sweet potato agriculture in ancient Hawai'i was incompatible with uncontrolled pigs, and there is every indication that pigs were both highly valued and carefully managed sources of protein. Pua'a were an integrated part of Hawaiian households , and the common presence of pa pua'a (pig pens) reflects the controlled, physically compartmentalized nature of pig manag ement in traditional Hawai'i. In contrast, today`s feral pigs are largely derived from animals introduced after western contact. Cook, for example, brought European pigs during his first voyage to Hawai'i, and many other introductions of Europea n and Asian swine followed . Clearly, domesticated pua`a carried strong cultural value in traditional Hawai'i. Aside from being an important possession and source of food, oral tradition describes the adventures of Kamapua'a (the pig child), a powerful demi -god who ranged over the islands and into the sea . However, pigs were never hunted game for ancient Hawaiians. The Polynesian interaction with these animals was one of near -complete domestication. Despite reference to hunting rats with bow and arrow, no historic or traditional knowledge sources describe ancient Hawaiians hunting pigs for either food or recreation . [Burrows, Isacc, Maly 2007: 1- 3] The article mentions that most modern hunting practices are of a recreational nature incorporating western traditions: The custom of recreational hunting evolved as Native Hawaiians assimilated western traditions in the context of these introduced game anim als. The earliest description of western- style hunting occurs in the opening decades of the 19th century, when outings were organized to control wild herds of cattle that threatened agriculture, residences, and forest resources. The practice increased in frequency and in popularity, with island hunters playing a key role in the state's response to the watershed crises of the late 19th century. These state- sponsored control efforts resulted in the removal of over 170,000 introduced mammals in the first half of the 20th century [xxii]. Pig hunting is a cherished modern practice for island sportsmen, including some whose subsistence depends to greater or lesser extent on wild game. Pig hunting in heavy cover is usually accomplished with the use of dogs, and the required training, feeding, and care for these animals can be a difficult and expensive task. The dogs locate, chase, grab, or bay the game, which is then typically dispatched by the hunter with a gun or knife [xxiii]. These techniques are derived directl y from western and European pig hunting practices, incorporated over the last 150 years in Hawai`i, and passed down through family generations [xxiv]. [Burrows, Isaccs, and Maly 2007: 4 -5] Cultural Impact Assessment 41 Formerly, Hanalei was part of the moku or district of Halelea. Wit hin the Halelea district the Hanalei being the largest of the 9 ahupua`a that stretched along the northeast end of Kaua`i. Figure 11. Showing Hanalei District, North Kaua`i and ahupua` a land division including Hanalei ahupua`a - location of the project area. Taxation Map Bureau Territory of Hawai`i. Ahupua`a Place Names, Descriptions, etc . The following descriptions of the project area ahupua` a begin with identification of the ma kai or ocean ward boundary points to the north and south. The boundary lines of the ahupua`a are referenced by specific landmarks that lead to the apex of the land division's high point ma uka to the west. The common description that ahupua`a are \"pie- shaped\" is inaccurate. However, it is a general practice to apply triangulation of the 3 -main boundary points of the ahupua`a when identifying its respective division lines. Additionally, ahupua`a do not terminate at the ocean ward boundary points. The boundary lines are purposely extended into the ocean so that it also includes the resources and Cultural Impact Assessment 42 minerals of the reef and ocean as well. The Hawaiian Legislature created the Office of Commissioner of Boundaries in 1862 to de termine exact boundaries of previously un- surveyed ahupua`a . In July 14, 1873 , the boundary commission met to identify the Hanalei boundaries through native Hawaiian references and landmarks. All persons who had received LCA awards for their lands by names only were mandated to appear before the BC to have their boundaries identified and determined. On 14 July 1873, Kealohanui \u2014a Hawaiian living in Hanalei \"since I was very little\" \u2014 testified before the Commission of Boundaries for the Island of Kaua'i on the boundaries of the ahupua'a. As transcribed in the commission's proceedings, notable among the p lace names and landmarks along the western boundary of the ahupua'a that Kealohanui recalled are the following: Kaunaapi residing place of chiefs Kauanohi & Hula house Kaunuaholea a starting place for races to the beach Kapaka stone place of worship (Heau [sic]) The following is the narrative, des cribing boundaries of the lands of Hanalei: No. 18 Boundary of the Ahupuaa of Hanalei 1873 July 14 Received the following petition Honorable Duncan McBryde Commissioner of Boundar ies for island of Kauai Sir: I am instructed by the Commissioners of Crown Lands to make applicat ion to you to define and settle the boundaries of the following lands on the Island of Kauai viz The Ahupuaa of Waimea \" Hanapepe \" Anahola \" Hanalei I am sir Your Obedient Servant Jno.

Cultural Impact Assessment 54 A Connection and Understanding of Place Traditional Wisdom & Knowledge Mo`olelo such as those presented here provide insight to the life ways, practices and beliefs of the ancient Hawaiians. EAL has included this example of a story to share of the kuleana or responsibility that ali`i (or in today's time - government and community leaders) should have to the land and the people that they manage and oversee. There are several definitions to consider when looking at this place name. A lae is a promontory or point. It is common throughout the Hawaiian archipelago to see traditional place names attached to them - especially along coastal areas. Lae are seaward bo undary points for ahupua`a as well. The details given in this portion of the mo`olelo is a crucial link to understanding the significance of a place - not only as a wahi pana, but as a wahi kapu or sacred place. This was realized only after rounds of res earch and lengthy discussions regarding traditional cultural practices and protocols associated with ali`i. Repeated field observations to consider alignment of celestial bodies such as the rising sun and moon were prompted by nuances within the mo`olelo t hat were initiated by the expertise and skill of the kahuna.

The habi t of identifying traditional landmarks whether they are mountains, beaches, etc. by generalization is common. A greater misfortune is the more popular trend and use of nicknames created by recent generations of transient and kama`ina residents. Disappoint edly, this has resulted in the greater loss of knowledge and awareness of traditional Hawaiian places and wahi pana. Knowledge of wahi pana and their place names for both subject ahupua`a of this CIA are on the verge of being forgotten and lost altogether. There is a sense of urgency to bring this to the forefront of our collective attention and create learning opportunities for the native Hawaiian community. Several map sources referenced for clarification of place names and peaks produced conf licting information and statistical data as well. Further research, including examination of oral histories and other sources for accurate identification is of great importance and priority.

The Hanalei River is a large (16.2 miles long) and dynamic river on Kauai's north shore, with headwaters in the 'Alaka'i with over 450 inches of rain, and with river flows ranging from20 -50 million gallons per day (mgd) to over 6 billion mgd. Because of its hydrogeographic features, Hanalei River has a large floodplain. It is also one of the 10 \"National Heritage Rivers\" in the United States, and has a relative abundance of all of the native Hawaiian amphidromous species of 'o'opu, 'opae and hihiwai or wi. The culturally and economically important 'o'opu nakea spawns on basalt boulders and large cobble stones w ithin the Hanalei River estuary. O 'opu (gobies), which utilize this portion Hanalei River, have cultural significance as well as being a food source. O 'opu n pili were traditionally used in certain ceremonies such as the weaning ceremony for first -born children and house warming feasts. O 'opu alamo 'o were considered kapu (sacred) and believed to be related to the mo 'o gods and bad luck if caught. Cultural Impact Assessment 61 Land Commission Award Claims Hanalei Ahupua`a With the Hanalei River as its main source, generations of native Hawaiians thrived in the ahupua`a of Hanalei inhabiting mostly the valley and nearby coastal areas. In pre -contact times, prior to transformation of ancient Hawaiian religious and political systems, Hanalei 's population was comprised of ali`i, kahuna and maka`inana that were experts in the professions of planting and farming, fishing, healing and kapa making. Land Commission Awards and Mahele Awards are Sources of Title adjudicated by the Land Commissioners to claimants. Mahele Awards are Sources of Title specifically issued to those chiefs who rec eived their lands from the king but failed to present their claims before the Land Commission and thus received titles to their lands from the Minister of the Interior. Kamehameha Deeds are Sources of Title to Crown Lands that Kamehameha III, IV and V conv eyed. Minister of Interior Deeds were Sources of Titles that conveyed lands from the government to private individuals by the Minister of the Interior during the Kingdom of the Monarchy. Patents - both Royal and Land were issued on the awards as evidence t hat the Government's right to commutation therein was satisfied. An award together with a patent perfected the awardee's title to the property. Grants by Royal Patent and Land Patent were Sources of Title deriving from the sales of government lands. The term \"Royal\" indicates that the document was issued during the Hawaiian Monarchy (up to 1893). The Land Patent or Land Patent Grant thus means the document was issued subsequent to the monarchy. The Kuleana Act of 1850 allowed maka'inana (Native Hawaiian commoners), in principle, to own land parcels at which they were currently and actively cultivating and/or residing. As a result of the Mhele, Land Commission Awards (LCA) were claimed in five distinct clusters within Hanalei Ahupua'a: the shoreline, the Maha'ana (taro fields adjacent to Waioli Ahupua'a), Puapuahoi -Limanui (the bottom lands of the Hanalei River), 'Anini (on the coast northeast of Hanalei Bay), and Kloa (inland and adjacent to Limanu i). A total of 7 4 claims for kuleana lands were brought before the Land Commission by native Hawaiians residing in the ahupua`a of Hanalei in 1846 -48. Of the 7 4 listed, 22 claims were not awarded LCAs. It is also known that many native Hawaiians did not a ppear to petition for their kuleana before the Land Commission. These claims, both awarded and not awarded, detail land usage referred to here as land use components. These components (204) comprise more than 124 taro patches or mo'o (one or more taro patc hes in a mo'o) (61.1%), 44 house lots (21.7%), 18 kula (garden/pasture) (8.9%), more than eight orange and more than one lemon trees (4.9%), five loko (ponds) (2.5%) a noni and banana patch, 400 head of cattle and Cultural Impact Assessment 62 160 acres of coffee, and a wharf (misc. 1% ).

H`ailona associated with chiefly births are thunder, lightning, earthquakes and heavy rains. Extreme weather conditions that bring rain are symbols of health and prosperity. Large volumes of rain fill the streams and rivers. It also saturates the ground and fill aquifers that will provide long term supplies of fresh water. The rains also nourish crops and the earth as well . In post -contact times, these types of h`ailona and severe weather conditions are inconvenient and burdensome by the general populace, including many native Hawaiians today. With influential seeds planted by the introduction of western and puritan ideal s since the arrival of Captain Cook (1778) and Calvinist missionaries (1820), a great divide between the Native Hawaiian and his environment and culture has continued to grow. The following is taken from an article titled, \"Earth's Weather Changed by Degeneration and Catastrophe\" published by Eden Communications with content adapted from the book, \"Weather and the Bible\". \"A serious flaw in secular environmentalism is that it sees nature as inherently good and normal. The biblical view is that creation and the weather were originally \"very good\" When God created the world and until the first man sinned. Due to man's sinfulness, the world did not stay \"very good.\" Not long after creation, all of nature was affected by man's fall to sin and God's curse. The pain and sorrow of this present world, along with severe weather, demonstrate an imperfect world. Furthermore, the worldwide flood of Noah's time would clearly have caused radical changes in our environment. Before the flood, the weather was evidently very mild and different from today; it did not even rain (Genesis 2:5-6, 7:11- 12). Thankfully, a new world is coming, when God will burn up this universe and create a new heavens and new Earth ( II Peter 3:10 -13, Isaiah 65:17, Revelation 21 ). Paradise will be restored. Once again, deadly storms will not be a part of our world.\" This is just one of myriad examples that show how the worldview of indigenous Hawaiians and western perceptions of nature are opposite poles apart. In a short period of only 2 centuries - 234 years since the arrival of Captain Cook and 192 years since the first ali`i converted to Christianity, a very high percentage of the Native Hawaiian population have become disconnected with the rich history, wisdom and traditions of their fore bearers. This has contributed to the loss of traditional cultural knowledge a nd the values of not only stewardship, but kinship Cultural Impact Assessment 69 with the land and environments of Hawai`i Nei. Ka Mo`olelo O Keaomele The Story of Keaomelemele This once- famous story of Keaomelemele was told by Moses Manu in 1884. His version was printed in the newspaper Ka Nupepa Ku'oko'a , and ran 31 consecutive weeks. The mo`olelo of Keaomelemele tells of the origins of the mo'o as a class of spiritual beings i n the islands. It also provides insight to the earliest sources of Hawaiian cultural practices and beliefs. Presented here, through this story are the traditions of hnai and mo`o. In this story, there are five children who are born to the gods. The eldest is Kahnaiakeakua (The one nurtured by the gods), who is raised by Kenuenue (the rainbow goddess) at Waolani. And then Paliuli (The dark verdant cliffs) , who is raised by Waka in the forests of `Ola`a on Hawai'i Island. Although Keaomelemele (The golden cloud) is the third child born, she is the heroine of the story. She is raised by Mo`oinanea, the highly revered mo`o or lizard goddess in a house made of clouds in the heavens. The other two siblings are Kaumaili`ul (Twilight resting in the sky) who to o is hnai by Mo`oinanea; and the youngest, Kaulanaikapki`i (Beautiful daughter of the sunset) who is raised by the god K and goddess Hi`ilei in the mythical island of K`aihelani. All five of them are taken from their birth parents and placed with their `aumkua or spirit/god parents who hnai and raise them as their own. They are reared to understand all that there is to know about the land and sacred resources that bring life and health to the people and all living forms. Each of them are groomed to become khuna or priestly experts in the cultural and spiritual practices of Hawai`i. In time, they are given respective roles and responsibilities and they are imparted special mana and divine ranks as well. Kaulanaikapki`i was given the domain of speech and healing and also becomes a master of the hula arts. She is given the ability to call upon the magic trees known as Makalei and Maku`ukao who bring and prepare fish and food to feed the masses of people. Kahnaiakeakua learns the responsibilities of the priesthood and becomes a master of navigation and the fishing arts. He is the first to show the Hawaiian people this knowledge, along with the arts of omen reading and astronomy, architecture and oratory. Keaomelemele possesses the sacred nature of a deity and the power of extrasensory perception. Along with Kaumaili`ul, she is given power over all the lands and the people. Paliulli remains with her guardian Waka. Upon completion of their training and rites of passage, they are given the kulean a or responsibility as akua and `aumkua (Hawaiian deities). They are now Cultural Impact Assessment 70 obligated to oversee, guide and inspire nourishment for the land, ocean, creatures and people. Mo`oinanea: The Nurturing of Mo`o The goddess, Mo`oinanea appears in many mo`olelo, chants and oral traditions. Mo'oinanea is said to have first arrived on O'ahu from Ku`aihelani and Kealohilani, the lands in the clouds. She settles at Kkaniloko, a celebrated place well known as one of two of Hawai`i's most sacred birthplaces o f ancient chiefs. (The other being Wailuanuiaho`ano here on Kaua`i) With her, she brings the mo`o and the expertise and traditions of the mo`o. A procession of mo'o starts out in Waialua, and they march into Waolani. By the time the first ones Cultural Impact Assessment 71 reach Nu'uanu valley, the end of the procession is still at Waialua. Kua mo`o, the spine or backbone of supernatural lizards (mo`o) are seen in the natural landscape and succession of peaks and ridges of mountain ranges. Within the story, other of origins of traditions are mentioned: Kenuenue is the sister who's going to raise Kahnaiakeakua. But she has borne no children. So when this baby is brought to her and needs to be breast -fed, she has no milk to offer. So she goes to the brothers, Kne and Kanaloa, and say s, \"I need milk for the baby.\" And they tell her, take these herbs, and some of them you rub on the breast, some of them you eat, and put this together, and you tweak the nipple of the breast and it will start to produce waiu , mother's milk. This is one of the l'au lapa'au (Hawaiian medicine) traditions. Hookau i ka wai , is a ceremony that is performed to make the breasts fill with milk. Ho olele i ka wai is a ceremony that is performed to make the breast cease flowing. The following is a prayer chant that was offered in the ceremony called, \"Ho`olele I Ka Wai\". Directed to the gods Lono, Kne and Nuakea who is said to be a part of the goddess Haumea who oversees all female functions and responsibilities. Also known as Keakea or Keakealani, Nuakea became the patron of nursing mothers and is prayed to when an increase or decrease in the flow of milk is desired. The prayer chant was offered when a nursing mother is ready to wean the child. It was also offered when a male c hild was about 4 to 6 years old, as he prepared to transition from the women's house to the hale mua or the men's house. This was for the ritual of separation. At that time it was asked that the child be given prosperity and to guard against the malice o f sorcery . E Lono, e Kne, e o name ) E lawe aku `oe i ka waiu o ka makuahine. Ia `oe e ka l, ke lawe a O Lono, O Kne, O Nuakea the woman with breast of mik for the child We are about to wean (name). Cultural Impact Assessment 72 Staunch the flow of milk in his mother. Yours are the sun, the moon, the stars; Carry away to the pillars of Kahiki And there leave the emaciation, peevishness and wailing of the child. Feed him with the sacred fish of Kne. That is the repose and quiet, This is your blessing, O Kne! Amama. The pray is ended and is set free. In Moses Manu's articles that appear in the Hawaiian language newspaper, Ka Nupepa Ku`oko`a in 1884, the Hawaiian historian/writer of Keaomelemele goes into an explanation that this is how different traditions, ar t forms and practices began and was handed down from that time. In his writings, he says: \"Compare this, to the foreign nations, who of course take milk from other animals, rather than produce their own. So they take the milk of the cow, or the milk of the goat, to feed the children, whereas the Hawaiians were very innovative.\" The kinolau or one of the plant body forms of the god, Lono is the `uala - the sweet potato. Nutritious young `uala or sweet potato leaves were fed to invalids and pregnant women to invigorate them. A broken sweet potato vine could be worn as a lei to induce the flow of milk in a nursing mother. This practice of herbal healing known as, l`au lapa `au hints to Lono's role in the forementioned chant as a means to aid and stimulate a source of breast milk through his plant forms. There are many other native Hawaiian plants that are kinolau forms associated with pregnancy and child bearing traditions. Strips of wauke (paper mulberry) - a Kne kinolau were also worn around the neck to induce the flow of breast milk. The hau tree sap, along with the base of its blossoms without its petals were mo`o kinolau that were important treatments for the pregnant woman preparing to go into labor. The slimy sap of the hau is said to reduce complic ations during delivery and child birth. There are many stories and places that are directly connected to mo`o presence. Mo`o are both male and female...some are generous and compassionate and caring; some are malevolent. In most cases, mo`o are revered as guardians and protectors of land and water sources that provide subsistence for the people. Different mo'o took up residence in different places, mostly watery spaces and land areas that are host to major and minor water sources. What are the mo'o, exactly? Cultural Impact Assessment 73 \"There are mo'o that are simply lizards -- the mo'o of the house, that's a little wall lizard. And the term is used for lizards, but it doesn't tell you that these were necessarily lizard formed. It's hard to say that mo'o are crocodilians or som e kind of serpentine creatures. They are entities that are associated with the wet places; they have to reside in the wet. Whether they take the form of a lizard -- because there are mo'o that are simply lizards, like the mo'o of the house: that's a little wall lizard. And the term in general is used for lizards. But this doesn't tell you that these mo'o were necessarily lizard formed. There just isn't a reliable sense of what they look like. We have two accounts, two stories of people who saw mo'o, and dealt with them, and it looked like people to them. Both of the accounts use the same description, in which the whole structure of the face is fluid and keeps moving, so that there's no way to grasp features. But not that they were shaped or formed like a lizard. \" -- Puakea Nogelmeir, Editor of Keaomelemele The story of Keaomelemele implies that all of the mo'o were in effect the descendants of Mo`oinanea. She is reputed to be the grand dame of her descendents, her offspring and all aspects of mo`o -responsibilities that are associated with her. The story identifies some of these mo'o individually and where they lived. In the mo`olelo of Keaomelemele, there are 12 noted mo`o who inhabit Kaua`i as large hills and mountains. The mo`o ali`i or royal chief of all of Kaua`i's mo`o was named Keolewa (also appears as Keaolewa). This mo`o resides at the summit of mount Ha`upu where it lives amongst the clouds. It is said that from Hupu, Keolewa had a full view of all Kaua`i. The famous freshwater spring and pool n amed Kemamo belonged to her as well. The following is an excerpt from the mo`olelo of Keaomelemele: Eia n mo`o ma o ka pu`u o Ha`upu i ke ao, ma laila `oia i noho ai e nn i n wahi a pau; a no kia mo`o ho`i ka wai kaulana o Kemamo.

The mountain of Kikiula in Hanalei is one of the named mo`o in the story that falls under the leadership of Keolewa. Kalalea oversees all the fresh water sources of Hanalei and the moku or district of Halelea . While there are other mo`o guardians who take up residence in fresh water pools, fish ponds and smaller streams, they too are part of the hierarchy that is accountable to the authority of Kalalea as well. Here is the translation: These were the lizards of Kauai, Keoloewa, a royal lizard whose home was on the summit of Haupu, among the clouds, where it remained and could see in every direction. To this lizard belonged the famous pool of Kemamo. Pu`umo`o Waioli river; Kili`oe and Ke`e lived at Ha`ena. Let the reader recall the story of Hi`iakaikapoliopele. Kili`oe was the lizard that took the body of Lohiau and hid it on Makana. In considering this tale, these lizards l ived on these islands with Mo`oinanea long before the other characters of the legends told by the people. Kili`oe, Ke`e and Miloli`i were the lizards of the cliffs of Kalalau and on to Polihale. Kawaili`ula was the lizard that owned Mana and Kekaha, and Makaweli was the lizard of Waimea and it was the owner of the reddish water that flowed there. Papai was the lizard at Hanapepe, a lizard that lived on the plain where the pili grass grew. It was said in this legend that this was the lizard that hid a spring on the plain that bears its name to this day, that is, Pu`uopapai. From Wahiawa to Koloa the lizard was Po`ipu. Its large pool still lies there to this day. These take in all of Kaua`i. All of them served under the lizard of the tall hill, Ha`upu. Lehuak ona was the lizard at Ni`ihau and it the \"pool of fish\" on Lehua. Maui's Kihawahine had mana like Mo`oinanea. This was the lizard that had the greatest number of Cultural Impact Assessment 75 caretakers and many worshippers to deify it. Chiefs and commoners worshipped it all over Maui, Moloka`i and Lana`i in ancient times and to it belonged the pit in the pond of Mokuhinia in Lahaina. Look at the story of Kihaapi`ilani. Under this lizard were Kalamainu`u and Kilioeikapua, both were bad lizards. It was said in this legend that Kihawahine made a circuit of Maui and also of Hawai`i, O`ahu and Kaua`i. In this journey there were many worshippers from Hawai`i to Ni`ihau. It was the only lizard that went around the islands of the group and this is the tale concerning the people of this lizard, Kihawahine. The mo`o that are mentioned in Keaomelemele are forested regions that contribute greatly to maintaining Kaua`i's major watersheds on Kaua`i. The word and idea of mo`o has to do with continuity and succession. One of the primary reasons behind the ancient Hawaiian tradition of hnai for the hiapo or first-born was to ensure the transference of ancestral knowledge and wisdom from the elder kpuna to the mo`opuna or grandchild. The word, puna meaning \" freshwater spring\" appears in both Hawaiian words for grandparent or elder (kpuna) and grandchild (mo`opuna). K means to stop or halt. Mo`o means to continue, succession or series. Especially so in a genealogical line; lineage. The fundamental source o f a puna (freshwater spring) is to give, nourish and produce life. Hence, the kpuna is one who has had his/her children; and in turn, their offspring have reproduced offspring of their own. The kpuna is one whose reproductive spring (puna) has stopped f lowing (k). The mo`opuna or grandchild is the succeeding spring, who too will grow and mature to produce offspring of their own. This repetition of life cycle from one generation to the next is essential to the continuation of family genealogies and connection to birth lands of Hawai`i. The Mo'o Kamo'ookamuliwai Wichman (1998:111) of the river,\" who: \"...was a mo'o that guarded the river crossing. He refused to let Hi'iaka cross the river on her way to H'ena to get Lohi'au for her sister Pele, and sent freshets of water to sweep her off her feet. Hi'iaka struck him dead, and since that time it has not been difficult to cross the river.\" Variations of Mo`o: The following is a list of \"Mo`o\" words that illustrate the purpose of preservation, perpetuation and continuity of traditions. Cultural Impact Assessment 76 Mo`o Lizard, reptile of any kind, dragon, serpent; water spirit. Succession, series, especially genealogical line, lineage. Mo`o `lelo Story, tale, myth, history, tradition, literature, legend, journal, chronicle, record. Mo`ok`auhau Genealogy Mo`omeheu Culture; great -niece or - nephew; relatives two whether blood or adopted; descendant; posterity. Mo`o Lono Priests of the lineage of Lono, devoted to the worship of Lono. Mo`omo`o Ridges (plural of moo). Rare. Also, young as of animals Kuamo`o Backbone, spine; road, trail, path Mo`o are symbols of protection, regeneration and succession of lineages for humans as well as that in the environment. They are also spiritual icons associated with forested regions and fresh water resources. Early Lesson in Acquiring Land Wisdom Transference of knowledge and skills in Hawaiian customs, beliefs and skills begin at a very young age. In the traditional Hawaiian family system, this on- going process is passed on from kpuna (grandparents) to mo`opuna (grandchild/children). In the extended family as well as within the commu nity, this exchange and transmission was shared from loea and kumu (masters and teachers) to haumna who are students and apprentices. Kpuna, loea, `lohe, khuna and kumu are traditional titles and stations that were, and are still held by ac complished elders, masters and teachers. They are the repositories of extensive knowledge, experience and skills, having endured many years of formal training in various practices and specialized areas of discipline. A customary belief shared by most masters and teachers is that the primary source for all Hawaiian knowledge are inspired and held by our ancient kpuna. Maintaining a relationship with ancestors through the practices of mo`ok`auhau, pule and ceremony are essential to receiving continued guidance Cultural Impact Assessment 77 and inspiration by ancestral sources. Equally important is the commitment to responsibly care for, and perpetuate Hawaiian ancestral knowledge by sharing and teaching others. E lawe i ke a`o a mlama a e `oi mau ka na`auao. He who takes his teachings and applies them increases his knowledge. `lelo No`eau #328 Origins of Change & Cultural Impacts Captain Cook's \"discovery\" of the Hawaiian Islands in 1778 marked the beginning of catastrophic changes to the physical, spiritual and cultural landscape of Hawai`i. Native Hawaiians first came in to contact with foreign diseases brought by Cook's crew, an d then by other ships of explorers and tradesmen that followed in his wake. Introduced species of animals brought by the expeditions of Cook and Vancouver in the 1700s included sheep, cattle and goats that quickly began to have negative effects on native s pecies of plants, birds, and habitats. Converse to accounts that describe these were \"gifts\" to the ali`i, they were purposely imported by captains for future food sources for their expedition crews. Along with new efforts to cultivate potatoes, the anima ls were specifically introduced to replace the fish and poi options that were foreigners were averse to. When King Kamehameha the Great unified all of the Hawaiian Islands into one kingdom under his rule in 1810, he kept the traditional land and kapu syst ems in place. However, 32 years had already passed since Captain Cook introduced Hawai`i to the Western World. From this, a market economy rapidly emerged attracting explorers, merchants, fur and sandalwood traders as well as whalers to Hawai`i. With this influx of newcomers to Hawai`i, the fabric of Hawai`i's ancient society quickly began to unravel. Different perspectives, beliefs and values began to mount in conflict with laws that had governed native Hawaiians for centuries. A gigantic shift prompted by a new emerging capital economy and the pressures of purchase power of goods and supplies removed the maka`inana from the balance of a communal, sustainable lifestyle and into laborious conditions. Although the sandalwood trade had found its way into the Hawaiian Islands around 1790, it wasn't until 1814 that the industry escalated. With Kamehameha I still in control of the sandalwood, he placed a kapu on young trees to allow for regeneration of forest supplies. He was adamant that no transaction was ever done on credit. Cultural Impact Assessment 78 Year of Critical Change 1819 was a year of critical change. Upon Kamehameha the Great's passing, his eldest son, Alexander Liholiho ascended to the throne as ali`i nui at the age of 22. However, he was no match for the political power and experience of Kamehameha I's favorite wife, Ka`ahumanu who insisted that she rule alongside him as Kuhina Nui or Queen Regent. Liholiho became the figurehead of the Hawaiian Kingdom, but it was Ka`ahumanu who took hold of the administrative power. The vice to usurp power and capitalize from the resources of the land and people, was fueled by greedy foreigners and the ruling chiefs alike. With the social order falling into disarray, Kamehameha II succumbed to the pressures of Ka`ahumanu and Kepuolan i to declare an end to the kapu system. Contrary to claims that the Hawaiians had grown increasingly dissatisfied with the ancient system, this was purely a political move that went beyond spiritual consciousness and integrity. Foreigners introduced Hawa iians to the concept of \"easy credit\" by using the persuasion of liquor, military uniforms, silks, guns, leather and silver mirrors that were purchased against future sandalwood income. The Hawaiian economy became overextended and Kamehameha II and the chiefs fell deeply into debt. The sandalwood trade exacted a heavy price in human life and health and in ecological damage. In 1823 the Reverend William Ellis described the transport of sandalwood from the adjacent mountains to the beach at Kawaihae by \"betw een two and three thousand men, carrying each from one to six pieces of sandalwood, according to their size and weight. It was generally tied on their backs by bands made of ti leaves.\" As the sandalwood forests began to disappear, the north- central Pacif ic whaling industry arrived to make its base in Hawai`i. The first whaling ship visited the Hawaiian Islands in 1820, marking the beginning of a 50 -year presence in Hawai`i's economy. Within a span of 30 years, the whaling industry expanded with more than 500 whaling ships visiting Hawai`i annually. By 1870, the petroleum industry had overcome the need for whale oil and the number of ships visiting Hawai`i began to spiral down. Funded by the American Board of Commissioners for Foreign Missions, the first missionaries arrived in the Hawaiian Islands on March 30, 1820 upon the Thaddeus . Much had already taken place while they were en route to Hawai`i; including the death of Kamehameha I, and the abolishment of the ancient kapu system by his son and successor - Kamehameha II, Liholiho. Theoretically, there was no alternate belief system in place. However, not all Native Hawaiians entirely relinquished their beliefs or cultural practices. Cultural Impact Assessment 79 Winning over the support of the ali`i, the missionaries set out to convert native Hawaiians to Christianity. With the advent of a written form of the Hawaiian language, the missionaries set out to fill the religious void throughout Hawai`i. Over the next two decades as attendance to their churches escalated, they became involv ed with developments in education and instructed the ali`i in the economy of western politics. By 1826, American Traders were complaining about outstanding debts owed to them by the king and chiefs and a general tax was imposed upon the people. Ultimately , greed exhausted the forest mountains of sandalwood and the maka`inn were driven into poverty. The grueling labor of pillaging the mountains of sandalwood led to the degradation and compromise of traditional values and beliefs of the Hawaiian people. Rising Tides of Political Change The Hawaiian Kingdom continued to be governed as a sovereign nation until 1838 without legal enactments. It was based upon a system of common law, which consisted partly of the ancient kapu system and the practices of cele brated chiefs that had been passed down by tradition. Advised by foreigners and recognizing Western forms as a useful model, Kamehameha III established t he Hawaiian Bill of Rights, also known as the 1839 Constitution of Hawai`i. This was the first crucial departure from the ancient ways - an attempt by Kamehameha III and his chiefs to guarantee that the Hawaiian people wouldn't lose their tenured land. Kuleana Act-August 6, 1850 One of the notable provisions of the Great Mahele was the Kuleana Act (1850). Under this provision, maka`inn - common people could petition for title to kuleana lands that they cultivated and lived on. With no concept of land ownership, Native Hawaiians did not understand the process, nor the need to make a claim for land that they already had been given tenure to live and work on. The only means of learning about the new Kuleana Act solely depended on word - of-mouth communication, or through printed announcements that required the ability to read and write. There was a fee for a required pre- claim land survey as well. Native Hawaiian claimants petitioning for their kuleana lands were also required to appear with two witnesses to back their claims. In many cases, commoners confused or uninformed of the requirements of this new law, were displaced from their lands. Cultural Impact Assessment 80 In the following yea rs, judicial and executive branches of government would be formed along with a system of land ownership under the Great Mahele of 1848. Despite its own political and structural growth, Hawai`i remained in a vulnerable position internationally. The Islands ' economy, meanwhile, totally moved toward capitalism under the influence of foreign trade. A New Industry in Sugar Arrives in Hawai`i In 1835, three New Englanders - William Ladd, Peter a. Brinsmade and William Northey Hooper, signed a lease with Kamehameha III for 980 acres of land to start the first large- scale commercial sugar plantation in Kloa on Kaua`i. This endeavor would open the floodgates to another chapter of change and impacts upon Hawai`i and its people. Contrary to what is viewed as Hawai`i's most historical, influential and successful industry of all time the development of the sugar in Hawai`i was largely responsible for the demise of Hawai`i's sovereign independence and the overthrow of Hawai`i's Kingdom. With this came foreign po wer and control of Hawai`i's land, water, and natural resources. Having access and control of lands in 1887, the struggle for control of Hawaii was at its height as David Kalkaua was elected to the Hawaiian throne. King Kalkaua signed a reciprocity trea ty with the United States making it possible for sugar to be sold to the U.S. market tax -free, but the foreign American businessmen were still distrustful of him. They criticized his ties to men they believed to be corrupt, for his revival of Hawaiian sciences and traditions, and encouragement of hula and oral traditions. Kalkaua's creation and funding of a board of genealogy, and the revival of the Hale Naua that promoted the esoteric, spritual and symbolic significance and connection to Hawaiian genealo gy, history and law was met disapprovingly as well. They were also greatly opposed to Kalkaua's building of the royal `Iolani Palace. However, it was the King's advocacy for native Hawaiian rights that posed the greatest threat for foreign and American b usinessmen. Many of his ministerial appointments went to native Hawaiians which reflected the king's consistent loyalty to his core constituency. The opposition was led by Lorrin Thurston, a grandson of missionaries who played a prominent role in the over throw of the Hawaiian monarchy. He formed the semi- secret Hawaiian League made up of a group of planters and businessmen who were anxious to control the kingdom of Hawai`i - both economically and politically. Accompanied by members of the Hawaiian League, Thurston coerced Cultural Impact Assessment 81 a new cabinet on King Kalkaua and used the threat of violence to press the King into accepting a new constitution that he had written, eliminating the King of his executive powers. The 1887 Constitution of the Kingdom of Hawai i became known as the Bayonet Constitution for the use of intimidation by the armed militia which forced King Kalkaua to sign it or be deposed. The document created a constitutional monarchy like that o f the United Kingdom , stripping the King of most of his personal authority, empowering the legislature and cabinet of the government. By 1890, the industry was tightly controlled by former miss ionary families and foreigners who owned 75% of all privately held lands in Hawai`i. Known as, \"The Big Five\" these included Alexander & Baldwin, C. Brewer & Co., Castle & Cooke, Theo H. Davies & Co., and American Factors which later became known as Amfac. Additionally, they eventually gained a monopoly over other economic aspects in Hawai`i manipulating banking, shipping, importing and exporting of goods, and warehouse commerce activities. Having corporate control over commodity distribution burdened Hawaiians and Hawai`i's wage -earning labor forces with high prices and a diminished quality of life. To survive Knaka `iwi had to become \"contract laborers and serve people like slaves\" (Kamakau 1992:403). They were anxious to obtain cheap labor to transform thousands of acres of land into sugarcane fields to secure their profits. This resulted in a Hawaiian population left in impoverished living conditions and eventually, loss of their native lands. Rise of Sugar, Overthrow of Hawaiian Monarchy Within decades, title to thousands of acres had fallen into the control of non- Hawaiians. Even Crown Lands that had been owned by the King and his successors, were used to pay for delinquent debts that had been exchanged for foreign goods and supplies. With clo se ties as missionaries to the Hawaiian monarchy along with capital investments, cheap labor and land, and increased global trade enabled them to prosper. In 1893, it was the businessmen of missionary families who were directly linked to the overthrow of t he Kingdom of Hawai`i. Queen Lili`uokalani was forced into imprisonment and the monarchy illegally overthrown. The new, self-proclaimed provisional government confiscated the remaining Crown Lands. Cultural Impact Assessment 82 In 1898 they were instrumental in lobbying for the annexation of Hawai`i by the United States to become the Territory of Hawai`i. In a short span of only 83 years from Kamehameha I's unification of the Hawaiian Islands in 1810 to the illegal overthrow of the Haw aiian monarchy in 1893, Hawai`i would go through a series of catastrophic change s. The commerce developments of sandalwood, whaling and subsequent industries that followed yielded a heavy price on human life and health, as well. Native Hawaiian Cultural Consultation It is the policy of the State of Hawaii under Chapter 343, HRS, to alert developers and decision makers, through the environmental assessment process, about significant environmental effects which may result from the implementation of certain actions. An environmental assessment of cultural impacts gathers information about cultural practices and cultural features that may be affected by actions subject to Chapter 343, and promotes responsible decision making. Articles IX and XII of the State C onstitution, other state laws, and the courts of the state require government agencies to promote and preserve cultural beliefs, practices, and resources of native Hawaiians and other ethnic groups. Chapter 343 also requires environmental assessment of cultural resources, in determining the significance of a proposed project. One of the most important parts of conducting a cultural Impact assessment and study is to hold consultation with Native Hawaiian kpuna or elders, Hawaiian cultural organizations, cultural practitioners and individuals from the community who potentially have knowledge of traditional Hawaiian sites, resources and cultural practices that are related to the project area as well as to the adjacent and extended land areas of the Hanalei ahupua`a. Ultimately, the goal as preparers of this CIA is to produce a document that can be used to protect and preserve the valuable knowledge and traditional practices of n `iwi knaka, the Native Hawaiian people of these places. EAL's goal was to meet with and interview a cross -section of indigenous Hawaiian people from the community; first and foremost, with kpuna or elders that have memories and personal experiences of the project area and the surrounding lands in Hanalei ahupua`a. In addition, EAL was hopeful to receive their `ike or insight and knowledge about customary practices and traditional places associated with or relating to the project area . EAL also aimed to seek out and speak with those of the mkua or parent generation who had pot ential knowledge, ties and experiences linked to the Cultural Impact Assessment 83 project area and Hanalei . Ages of interviewees varied from individuals in their early 20s to 86. In the window allocated to complete this cultural impact assessment study, EAL has interviewed a total of 3 indigenous Hawaiians. Ma jority are residents of Hanalei lands . Two individuals live outside of Hanalei . Some of the interviewees and informants are Kpuna or elders, educators, activists and cultural practitioners. Some of them fall into 2 or more categ ories. All are of Native Hawaiian ancestry with personal ties and connection to Hanalei . In this endeavor to \"interview\" Native Hawaiians, EAL chose to do so in a Hawaiian manner of kukkuk or through \"talk -story\". In speak ing with interviewees without being nele or as a prying meddler by being annoyingly inquisitive was the approach. While there are specific points of interest for questions that lead the discussions, it is important that with each person engage in a manner that is respectful and without imposing pressure. To the Native Hawaiian, a nele person will never get anywhere by being bold, blunt and direct. However, he or she can be successful by leading up to a subject through indirection and a more `ol u`olu or gracious approach. E very attempt to avoid being maha`oi or presumptuous, brazen and insensitively forward was used. I n the traditional Hawaiian household that was led by kpuna and mkua who were adamant that the values of aloha (love), ha`aha`a (humility), ahonui (patience) and h`ihi (respect) apply to the way that one behaves and interact with others. This is especially so when talking and meeting with kpuna, for with the slightest tone of pejorative stance or speech, they will cease to share their valuable insight and experiences. It helps tremendously to have some sort of association with individuals as well, for more is shared when there is a level of comfort, trust and familiarity. Thus, excessive note -taking and the use of recording devic es such as video cameras and tape recorders are not utilized. Downside consequences were avoided by having a Hawaiian face; choosing to utilize colloquial jargons and speaking in the vernacular; making links through genealogy; by not having a tape recorder; being understanding and empathetic; using kama`ina as interviewers; judicious note- taking when necessary; by keeping our promise not to divulge any interview comments if requested by the subject; and of course, by not being nele or maha`oi. If the int erviews had been conducted using a Western format these questions would be asked straight forwardly: 1. What type of cultural practices and cultural beliefs do/did your family practice? Cultural Impact Assessment 84 2. Where do/did these cultural practices occur? 3. How do/did the area's sit es features or land affect you or your family's cultural practices and beliefs? 4. How would the plans to develop single family residence affect you or your family's cultural beliefs and cultural practices? Instead, talk -story sessions with interviewees in individual and semi- group settings that were comfortable for the participants was used . Oftentimes our discussion took place in their yard, or at their home. Already well -aware of the extra - sensitivity of asking such questions would be a rude approach of nele and maha`oi, EAL allowed the conversations to flow and be directed in ways that were most appropriate and pono for those who were kind to extend us their time, energy and mana`o. The interviewees that EAL engaged with for this CIA are: 1. Kaunanoe Hoomanawanui Burial Sites Specialist, SHPD Kpuna , Hanalei Resident 5. Kaleo Chandler Haena Resident 6. Michael Olanal an Haena Resident 7. Michael Ching Hanalei Resident 8. Maakala Kaaumoan Executive Director of Hanalei Watershed Hui, Hanalei Resident 9. Barbara Robeson Wainiha Resident 10. Anne Schneider Princeville Resident 11. Michael Loo Oahu Resident , Former VP at Princeville Corp. 12. Chipper Wickman Haena Resident 13. Charlie Spencer Hanalei Resident, Taro Farmer 14. Rodney Haraguichi Farmer and Fisherman , Hanalei Resident 15. Chris Ko bayashi Hanalei Resident 16. Dick Sloggett Hanalei Resident 17. Glen Kobayashi Hanalei Resident Cultural Impact Assessment 85 18. Hobey Beck Hanalei Resident 19. Keola Sheehan Hanalei Resident 20. Lynnette White Anahola Resident 21. Christian Marsden Hanalei Resident 22. Avery Youn Wailua Resident 23. Michael Schmidt Hanalei Resident Not reached but attempt ed to contact 1. Gaylord Wilcox 2. Mesberg Family 3. Mala and Ka' ui Fu 4. Naomi Yokotake 5. Gladys Tasaka 6. Nancy Pfleuger All interviews were conducted by Nancy McMahon between October 2016 and August 2017. Subsequently, EAL found that just about most of the interviewees were interested in learning about the project itself but no that concerned except for a few informants . It is not known why the uncontacted informants did not return calls, perhaps they were cautious to share their mana`o o r thoughts and knowledge . As such, the priority topics needed to conduct this CIA of cultural resources and impacts were overshadowed. It was a challenge to steer conversations into that direction without appearing to be presumptuous and insensitive to the needs of the interviewers to be informed of the project. EAL spent a considerable amount of time attempting to provide an overv iew of the pr oject . In addition to the 23 individuals listed above that graciously participated as interviewees for this CIA. Mahalo a nui loa i `oukou for your generous support to contribute and collaborate to this success of this cultural impact assessment and study.

Analysis of Impacts 11 A bibliography of references, and attached records of interviews which were allowed to be disclosed. Bibliography Source: State of Hawai'i Environmental Council, Guidelines for Assessing Cultural Impacts (1997) The remainder of this section summarizes with respect to each of the required topics. Each informational requirement identified in the above table is discussed in its own subsection, with a summary of findings and conclusions and, where appropriate, relates the requirement to other sections of the document. Consultation Methodology & Results As with the composition of the CIA d ocument, EAL employed interview methods consistent with indigenous Hawaiia n values . Specific values and methods applied to the interview process included: Kukkuk , also known among locals as \"talking story\", is a quintessentially Hawaiian approach to sh aring information intended to avoid being seen as nele (i.e., nosy or meddling) and instead being perceived as 'olu'olu \u2014 gracious \u2014in conduct. By approaching the specific interview topics in an indirect manner, EAL interviewers communicated a level of sinc erity and respect for the interviewee and subject matter and so avoided their curiosity being interpreted as maha'oi , i.e., brazen and forward. Aloha , or love and abiding regard for the Hawaiian landscape and culture formed the basis for the interview process, communicating deep affection for the subject matter and individuals involved. Ha'aha'a, or a sense of humility, particularly when speaking with kpuna , where a single pejorative act or statement could create a sense of offense in the interview s ubject which would lead them to withhold their insight and experience. Ahonui , or patience, and a measured tempo to the contact and interview process which allows for a sense of comfort, familiarity, and trust to emerge. Cultural Impact Assessment 88 H'ihi , respect, both for the in terviewee and for the subject matter were kept at the very heart of the interview process and shaped the methods employed by EAL. To these ends, the use of recording devices and a standardized questionnaire were not employed unless requested to do so. Int erviews were conducted in individual and small -group settings in homes and back yards. Conversations could flow toward, and at times away from, the specific subject of the p roject as the interview subjects deemed appropriate. Selection of Interview Subje cts As noted on pg. 82 Native Hawaiian Cultural Consultation , an assessment of cultural impacts gathers information about cultural practices and cultural features that may be affected by actions subject to HRS Chapter 343, and promotes responsible decisio n-making. This process is informed by meeting and talking with members of the indigenous Hawaiian community in the area affected by the proposed action. In the preparation of this CIA, representatives of EAL identified certain criteria which guided the pro cess of identifying individual's familiar with cultural practices and features in, or near, Hanalei ahupua'a . Factors which were considered in the evaluation of potential informants were: Was the candidate an Indigenous Hawaiian? Was the candidate from the Hanalei area? Was the candidate a kpuna or elder, with memories and personal experiences of the project area? Was the candidate a mkua , or member of the parent generation, with potential knowledge, ties, or experiences of the project area and the Hanalei or Halelea region? Was the candidate familiar with, or possessing insight into, the customary practices and traditional places in or near to the project area? If a candidat e met one or more of the above criteria and was willing to share his or her perspective, the person was considered an appropriate candidate for the interview process. In the timeframe available for the preparation of the CIA, representatives of EAL spoke with 13 native Hawaiians all with personal ties to Hanalei ; EAL also spoke with 10 additional non -Hawaiian interview subjects possessed of unique knowledge relevant to the assessment. All interviews were conducts between October 2016 and August 2017 . Mos t interviewees were residents of Hanalei . The age of interviewees ranged from 2 0 to 86. Cultural Impact Assessment 89 Kpuna Recollections In summary only a few informants had direct contact with the property. One walked the road [SIHP#50 -30+03- 02353] gathering sisal. Another when he was young went there to collect guava. Another had hunting pigs with his father. Another was told there was a Chinese Cemetery there. Many were told to stay away from the property. Their assumptions are that the area is sacred. A few were told there is a heiau or ahu up there on the parcel. No one mentioned any fresh water spring or traditions related to the hala trees. Only one knew exactly where site SIHP# 50 -30-03-02354. They did not the function of the site. Consultation during the AIS In the fol lowing section is the documentation on interviews \"talk story\" with informants about the project area and parcel as to their knowledge of any concerns regarding historical properties. This section was included in the AIS (McMahon, 2017) EAL has been to the parcel some 10 -20 years ago either at a Planning Commission inspection or an inspection by the Kaua'i Historic Preservation Review Commission, both at the time Kaua'i County Planner Anne Schneider and former VP of Princeville Corp., Michae l Loo recalled the site visit with several community members, commissioners, US Fish and Wildlife staff, County, DLNR and Princeville staff. It has been suggested that US Fish and Wildlife use the location to move the Hanalei Valley Overlook to. But there was concern about burials or a cemetery on the parcel, so a site visit was conducted. Some place shortly after the entrance but off the highway, through the thicket of guava, three stone mounds (one large, a second mound which was similar in size to the first mound and a small mound) were identified and pointed out to by the community stating that these were burials. During that field inspection, some community members speculated that those were mounds contained burials. But no one knew who they were nor were any claims made. At that time, SHPD Kauai Archaeologist Nancy McMahon did not write up a field report on this site inspection nor identify any burial sites since this could not be verified and no one came forward to claim the burials. After seeing t he mounds US Fish and Wildlife did not pursue buying the parcel from then owner Princeville Corporation. Around 2014, the construction of a rock gate at the entrance to the parcel was being constructed. The author received a call from the Kauai Archaeolog ist, Mary Jane Naone, asking if I knew about any historic properties on that parcel as she had heard from others in the community about something up there. I told her the story about the three mounds. When I received a call about this property from the r ealtor of the current owner, I related the same story. Cultural Impact Assessment 90 Prior to the archaeological survey, consultation with the current SHPD staff on Kauai, the burials sites specialist was taken out for a site inspection on October 19, 2017. No information was brought forward from this field inspection. No records exist for the Burial Program on this location. The burial specialist questioned the author as to why they were not recorded as burial sites. The author stated no confirmation existed nor did anyone come forw ard with a claim. The mounds could have been possible burial mounds or ahu. The field inspection revealed that the plateau of the ridge was cleared and grass and some trees existed. The boundary edges had a push pile of dirt and vegetation but no mounds were found. Exploration Associates Ltd. contacted several members of the Hanalei and Princeville community to ascertain if they had any knowledge of the former uses of this parcel or the immediate area adjacent to the project area. Only one person, Jay Furfaro remembered that the Kellett family (part of his family) might be buried there and provided a headstone plaque. No exact location was known for this family burial location. The Kellett's acquired much of the surrounding lands and possibly this par cel. Jay also mentioned that an ahu existed on the parcel. In about November 2016, Barbara Say, her son and the neighbor went out to look for the Chinese Cemetery which they thought was in this area but they could not find anything on this parcel. Another informant, Kaleo Chandler was hired to help clear the parcel by hand with chainsaws by the previous owner. The author met him on the parcel on December 1, 2016 where he recalled that as a boy, he thought there was a Chinese cemetery in this area with urns , flags markers, and stones to mark where they buried the urns a year after the death. He said he stayed away from the side where he believed to be the Cemetery was located during his clearing. He also mentioned a heiau where the rock formations are locat ed at the point. He took the author, where rock alignments and then a wall above the Hanalei Bay Overlook were identified. He recalled the area was a party area for the high schoolers, and used by pig hunters and pot growers. He suggested speaking to Michael Olanalan who took care of the parcel when the movie the South Pacific was shot there. Michael Olanalan was interviewed in February 21, 2017, Michael did not recall a Chinese Cemetery nor a heiau in the parcel. He thought the rock wall I saw was maybe from the old highway that was there. He thought I should find remnants of that old highway. He said it was a party place, he hunted there with his father for pigs and recently lots of pot growers were in there. Michael said that when the movie \"The Sout h Pacific\" was being filmed there, they put the dirt road in on the Cultural Impact Assessment 91 plateau. He thought it might be possible to find some of the old set props but he could not recall if they left it there or removed things. The author spoke to Maka`ala Ka`aumoana. She h ad emailed previously about a heiau on the ridge. She also mentioned there should be some waterworks on the lower slopes of the parcel, but this appears to be below the Hanalei Overlook and on Hanalei Wildlife Refuge lands and not on this parcel. The Ching Ma Leong store was previously located within 1/4 -mile, downslope from the proposed project. This store used water from a pipe that received water from a perennial spring located in the hillside within proximity to this proposed project site. Post hurrica nes, the community of this place utilized springs to provide water to its residents. Thus, perennial springs are considered by the community to be an important natural, cultural, and economic resource, but are not located on this parcel. Barbara Robeson pr ovided some background about the Hanalei Valley area and knew about the old road directly up from the Hanalei Bridge by the power station, where there was a store, Post Office and Plantation Home, which she said she had photos of along the old road up from the Hanalei Bridge. Again, this area in not on the parcel for this project but appears to be on the US Fish and Wildlife Service Lands. Michael Ching also provided some information about his knowledge regarding Chinese burials. He stated he heard rumors of burials on the ridge but not Chinese. The Chinese cemetery started around 1803 and the Chinese stayed in that area being very good at taking care of their ancestors. Only once did he know of a case in Oahu where they found Chinese urns outside of a c emetery boundary. He did not believe any Chinese were buried on Kaunuhua Ridge. He was also aware of this parcel and helped some physicians look at this parcel to build a joint home there. A primary concern relative to cultural impacts: it was suggeste d that a fresh water spring associated with traditional uses is on this parcel. It can be seen from the side of Route 560 . There has been no verification of Hawaiian place names for springs along the ridge or at this location . It is a seep and not a spring. Its source is unknown. There are two aquifiers in this area. According to one information, his recollection, which was that this water was coming from some drainage pipe. EAL was not able to reach that original informant that stated this. Ethnograp hic-Oral History Methodology As noted previously under Consultation Methodology & Results, the interview Cultural Impact Assessment 92 procedures employed were specifically chosen to be consistent with native Hawaiian concepts of propriety. Interviewers avoided use of electronic recor ding devices such as cassette tape or digital voice recorders, cameras, or video cameras. If, as the CIA notes the interviews had been conducted in a standardized Western scholarly format without reference to Hawaiian cultural values, the questions might have been uniformly presented and limited to the topics most relevant to the project, such as: What type of cultural practices and cultural beliefs do/did your family practice? Where do/did these cultural practices occur? How do/did the area's sites, features, or land affect your or your family's cultural practices and beliefs? How would the plans to develop a single- family residence affect you or your family's cultural beliefs and cultural practices? However, this approach was considered inappropriat e for the reasons discussed in Consultation Methodology & Results. It was recognized the challenge of gently steering conversations towards topics of project relevance without being presumptuous or insensitive to the needs of the interviewees, but believes that the benefits of its approach outweigh any possible drawbacks. Historical & Archival Research Primary research references used in this study include, but are not limited to \u2014 land use records, including those obtained from an extensive review of Hawa iian Land Commission Awards (LCA) records from the 1848 Great Mhele, territorial land patent grants, oral history interviews preserved in the Bishop Museum Archive, and an extensive review of historical texts authored or compiled by D. Malo (1951), M.K. P ukui (1972), Handy and Handy with Pukui (1972), and Marti - Kini (2009). The study also relied on accounts from Hawaiian language newspapers such as Ka Na'i Aupuni and Ka Nupepa Ku'oko'a (translat ed by P. Nogelmeir and M.K. Pukui). Other sources examined and incorporated include regional planning documents, modern English language newspapers, travel writers' familiar with the Hanalei region, and important testimony of elder kama'ina of the lands of the Halelea -Hanalei region. Researchers also took full advantage of historical and archival resources from the collections of the Bishop Museum, Kaua`i Museum, and Kaua`i Historical Cultural Impact Assessment 93 Society . Research of published and unpublished written literature, as well as Hawaiian language documen ts, maps and photographs found in public and private collections for references and other relevant information were explored. Additionally, the examination of indigenous Hawaiian chants and interviews conducted with kpuna or Native Hawaiian elders were extraordinarily revealing and valuable to producing this cultural study. Homes for the cowboys, who were mostly Hawaiian, were built on both sides of the highway near the current site of the Princeville Shopping Center. During the 80 years that the Princevi lle Ranch House (Kikiula) was used as a dwelling, it was home to many different Princeville Plantation and Ranch managers, including the Wundenberg, Low, Conradt, Koelling, Willis, and Sanborn families. The Sanborns also had a house on the shoreline of Hanalei Bay, which they built in 1910 and referred to as the Mauka (Mountain) House. Fred Conant was instrumental in the creation of the Hanalei Valley Lookout. Also under Conant's direction, a new home for the Princeville Ranch manager was built in Hanalei on Weke Road. The Princeville Ranch Manager's House later became the home of Larry and Jeanie Ching (this is Michael Ching's parents). The lands of the Princeville Ranch continued to be used for cattle in the 1930s, and an area of the upper slopes was planted with pineapples. Cultural Resources & Practices Identified Neither the literature sources consulted nor the interviews conducted identified any ongoing native Hawaiian cultural resources or practices located on the Gearon single family residence project . As indicated by background research and many of the interviewees, the broad Halelea -Hanalei region has a rich history replete with mo'olelo (legends) and wahi pana (traditional place names and their stories) however none of these have any significant direct or indirect connection to the project site. In addition, the long history of ranching and some cultivation in this area has likely destroyed any cultural materials and since the land has been overgrown and private prevented in cultural pract ices which might have been present in the past . This is confirmed by the Archaeological Inventory Survey prepare by Exploration Associates Ltd. for the Gearon single- family residence. Analysis of Impacts The Hanalei -Halelea region, which includes the area proposed for the single- family residence, is a place of prehistoric and historic significance in the Hawaiian Cultural Impact Assessment 94 civilization. Oral histories and written records tell of the continuing traditions, beliefs, and cultural practic es of the region. However, none of the background research, archaeological evidence, or interviews conducted in the preparation of this Cultural Impact Assessment indicates that the cultural practices, resources, or beliefs are tied to the proposed project site. This longstanding pasture for aniamals use by Princeville Ranch of the area may be one reason for the absence of cultural properties and resources in a region which has seen many centuries of habitation by native Hawaiians. The site has been significantly graded in the recent past. The land was not accessible. The information summarized in this report indicates that there are no known extant historic cultural resources within the immediate vicinity of the project site that may be impacted because o f the propose d project. Conclusions from the recent Archaeological Inventory Survey prepared for this project by Exploration Associates Ltd. (McMahon , 201 7) suggest that historic -era alterations involved large -scale ground disturbance for the old roadway and one archaeo logical resource (SIHP# 50 -30-03-02354 ). Traditional Hawaiian uses of the lands in the Hanalei ahupua'a are known from prehistoric times. Such uses, including habitation, agriculture, and gathering continues throughout the region, but none is known to exist within the project area. Access to sensitive wahi pana, streams, the shoreline, or the mountains will not be compromised by this project Native Hawaiian beliefs and traditions associated with the Hanalei ahupua'a persist but these are general associations not specific to the project site. No kpuna (elders) or mkua (parents) could be located that had knowledge of traditional beliefs or practices specific to the project site. This CIA has been prepared in accordance with the guidelines set forth by the State of Hawai'i Environmental Council for the completion of Cultural Impact Assessments and the requirements of HRS Chapter 343 and HAR \u00a711 -200. There are no known cultural reso urces or practices with the potential to be negatively impacted because of the proposed project. Closing Cultural impacts upon Native Hawaiian people, customary practices and religious beliefs have infiltrated the history of Hawai`i Nei for more than 2 00 years since the arrival of Captain James Cook in 1778. Within a period of 40 short years, the Kapu system was abolished by Kamehameha II - Alexander Liholiho and the Queen Regent, Ka`ahumanu bringing an end to the strength of the closely -knit Cultural Impact Assessment 95 Hawaiian r eligion and political system of Hawai`i. With the arrival of Calvinist missionaries in 1820 came a new god and religion which leveraged the beginnings of severing the native Hawaiians' veneration of the natural world. By the 1890s, subsistence lifestyles, agriculture and rural communalism had entirely been replaced by commercialism, urbanization and individualism as key features of life in the Hawaiian Islands. Foreign sugar plantation moguls usurped control of Hawai`i's prime agricultural lands and fresh water sources to sustain their crops. Miles and miles of irrigation ditches were engineered to redirect the natural flow of water out of the ahupua`a; forever changing the balance of environments and lifestyles of generations of native Hawaiian families. By and large, the issues of cultural impacts in Hawai`i are rooted in the loss of access and use of Hawai`i's land and natural resources as formerly practiced in pre-contact Hawai`i. It is a deep -seated dilemma caused by the intrusion of forced principles brought on by Westernization and the rise of a monetary economy. Included are in this CIA are the kpuna's names and descriptions of their kuleana land claims presented to the Land Commission foll owing the Great Mahele in 1848. Many of these families stil l exist and inhabit the lands of Hanalei today. However, the lasting affects upon native Hawaiian people that have resulted in their disconnect to traditional practices, beliefs and knowledge of place goes back further to the introduction of Christian tenets that prohibits veneration and expression of nature or ancestor worship in any way, shape or form. There is great anxiety amongst contemporary Hawaiians to embrace the values and ideologies of their ancient ancestors out of fear instilled by the doctrines of the dominant western religion which most have adopted. This alone, largely contributed to the depreciation of interest to learn and maintain family genealogies, enroll to formal training in cultural practices that engage in ceremony and spiritual pr ocesses, etc. All forms of traditional Hawaiian cultural practice included religious and spiritual processes of protocols, ceremonies, prayers and prescribed tabus and res trictions. The removal of this crucial part of Hawaiian cultural expression separated and dissolved the sacred and profound of the practice itself. It also eliminates the individual's conscious connection to the environment which is also considered as a sacred and profound aspect of the practice itself. One of the primary goals w as to complete a comprehensive CIA study that would satisfy the requirements of HRS Chapter 343 and HAR \u00a711 - 200 by following the guideline established by the State of Hawai`i Environmental Council for the Cultural Impact Assessment 96 completion of Cultural Impact Assessments. As deve lopments continue to occur throughout Kaua`i and Hawai`i, the required processes of conducting environmental reviews and cultural impact assessments such as this, will continue to seek out indigenous Hawaiian informants who possess the expertise and knowle dge about their cultural practices, religious beliefs and storied places. While it is great that researchers and authors of CIAs have the potential to produce documents with invaluable information, it is no longer uncommon to find end results of studies determine no known cultural resources or practices are occurring today. There is a sense of urgency for native Hawaiians to rejuvenate themselves in the cultural practices, teachings and knowledge of the ancients of these islands. There will continue to be findings of \"no negative cultural impacts\" if cultural practices are no longer occurring. And precious lands of their ancestors will be surrendered future developments that may ultimately erase every bit of cultural value. Perhaps it may be that many contemporary indigenous Hawaiians have forgotten or have never received transmission from elders of the previous generations of mo`olelo, mo`ok`auhau, wahi pana and other `ike or knowledge that are pertinent to Hawaiian cultural practices. However, it is never too late to learn and embrace the teachings of ancestral intelligence that is the birthright of every living and yet to be born Hawaiian. Native Hawaiians have the mana and the ability to participate and articulate upon the intricacies of Hawaiian knowledge and intelligence. Not only were they expert fishermen and planters, but they were priests and master genealogists, navigators, biologists, geologists, artists, craftsmen, astronomers and more whose scholarship of the land, environment and atmosphere was insightful and profound in ways unimaginable today. To reiterate the use of the word, minamina on page 4 : A considerable amount of focus was put toward the research of traditional places, their names and stories when preparing this study. It is minamina, a sad and unfortunate loss when valuable information is lost or forgotten. There is an urgent need to preserve and pass on ancestral knowledge that was widely known just a few generations ago. Kaua`i's unique culture and heritage associated with traditional places are key to nurturing a sense of place and connectivity. It is a vital component to the health and wellbeing of native Hawaiians, as well as the perpetuation of native Hawaiian lif e ways and culture. In closing, another translation of minamina as: To prize greatly, value greatly, especially of something in danger of being lost; to value, place great value on; value, worth. Culturl Impact Assessments present an exceptional opportunity for its Cultural Impact Assessment 97 development partners to join to support the revival and rejuvenation of traditional Hawaiian cultural education . Ho`i hou i ka `iwi kuamo`o Return to the backbone An `lelo no`eau or ancient Hawaiian proverb and poetical saying to return to the homeland or family after being away. This doesn't only pertain to a physical departure or absence from the `ina hnau (birth lands) or `ohana (family). It especially speaks to the importance of immersing oneself in his or her cultural practices, traditions and values. It is a reminder of the fundamental relationships and inherent connections Native Hawaiians have to their ancestral homelands that are based on environmental kinship and land wisdom. Na wai ho`i ka `ole o ke a kamai, He ala nui ma`a ka hele `ia e o`u mau kupuna? Why shouldn't we know this, when it was a road often traveled by our ancestors? Cultural Impact Assessment 98 I ka w mamua, ka w mahope The future is in the past Hawaiian ancestral knowledge and culture is the umbilicus that connects Hawaiian people to the `ina upon which they are born or where they will choose to live and raise their `ohana. Acquiring a deeper understanding of the past is an essential component to arriving at the right decisions for creating a culturally pr osperous future that is vital in the evolution of a prideful, flourishing society. It is interesting to note that in Hawaiian, the past is referred to as ka wa mamua, or \"the time in front or before.\" Whereas the future, when thought of at all, is Ka wa mahope, or \"the time which comes after or behind.\" It is as if the Hawaiian stands firmly in the present, with his back to the future, and his eyes fixed upon the past, seeking historical answers for present -day dilemmas. Such an orientation is to the Hawaiian an eminently practical one, for the future is always unknown, whereas the past is rich in glory and knowledge.

Princeville, Hawaii Helios Hanalei LLC (Helios) is the landowner of a 14.109 acre parcel in Princeville, Hawaii. Please see the enclosed location map. The lot is located within the Conservation District as designated by the State Land Use Commission. Helios is proposing to build a single-family residence on the Lot (under Hawaii Administrative Rules \u00a713-5-41, only one residence is permitted). The proposed residence is a one-story structure to be located within a relatively level cleared area near the center of the western end of the lot. Please see the enclosed site plan. On behalf of the landowner, we are preparing a Hawaii Revised Statutes Chapter 343 Environmental Assessment of the landowner's proposed single-family residence. The Department of Land and Natural Resources Office of Conservation and Coastal Lands (OCCL) is the approving agency for the Environmental Assessment. If OCCL finds that the proposed single-family residence would not result in any significant environmental or cultural impact, a Conservation District Use Permit (CDUP) would then be requested from OCCL. To date, an archaeological inventory survey and a cultural impact assessment have been completed. One possible pre-contact historic property, located within a dense guava grove outside the potential residence location, will be preserved within a buffer zone. Based upon numerous community interviews and the studies that have been conducted, we believe the enclosed draft Environmental Assessment is accurate and complete, however, we are seeking any additional input you may have in identifying potential environmental and cultural impacts associated with the proposed residence. The proposed single-family residence would be designed and limited in size and design in accordance with the standards set forth in Title 13, Hawaii Administrative Rules pertaining to the Conservation District for single-family residences (\u00a713-5-41). In conjunction with this work, we are requesting any written comments and/or information with respect to your area(s) of concern, if any.

The Lot encompasses approximately 14.109 acres bordered on the north, west and south sides by Kuhio Highway and on the east by a portion of the Hanalei National Wildlife Refuge. The Lot was purchased by Helios Hanalei LLC (\"Helios\"), the applicant here, from the Richard Carlson Living Trust in November 2016. The Lot is located in the State Conservation District, Resource Subzone and the Special Management Area (\"SMA\") as defined within Hawaii Revised Statutes (\"HRS\") Chapter 205A. The parcel is undeveloped, except for an entrance gate and a rock wall along a small portion of the perimeter abutting Kuhio Highway. HELIOS intends to apply to the Board of Land and Natural Resources for a Conservation District Use Permit (the \"COUP\") to construct a single-family residence and related improvements on the Lot (the \"proposed project\") under Hawaii Administrative Rules (\"HAR\") \u00a7\u00a713-5-24(c) R-7 and 13-5-41. At present, there are no dwellings on the lot. Accordingly, a single-family dwelling is permissible under HAR \u00a7\u00a713-5-41(b) and (c). As part of the approval process for the single-family residence, HAR \u00a713-5-31(a)(l) requires submission of a HRS Chapter 343 draft Environmental Assessment (\"EA\"). The Department of Land and Natural Resources Office of Conservation and Coastal Lands is the approving agency for the EA and the COUP. The proposed Conservation District single-family dwelling would be located on a cleared and relatively flat area (the \"proposed site\" or \"project site\") near the center of the western portion of the Lot. Historically, the Lot has been unused. Today, the built environment surrounding the Lot includes commercial and public facilities as well as residential uses. Features of the proposed single-family dwelling are designed to minimize its visual impact from the neighboring area and the Hanalei Valley floor. The proposed dwelling: 504629.1 (i) Is one story with a maximum height of 18 feet 1.5 inches above existing grade (less than the maximum of 25 feet prescribed in HAR \u00a7 13-5); (ii) Has 4,342 square feet of living space, and a 622 square foot pool and spa for a total \"maximum developable area\" of 4,964 square feet (within the maximum of 5,000 square feet prescribed in HAR \u00a7 13-5); (iii) Is set back between 5 and 100 feet from the sloped areas overlooking Hanalei Valley; (iv) Is finished with materials which conform to the surrounding environment, including cedar shake roofing and exterior walls finished in teak siding, and lava rock privacy garden walls; and (v) Includes a landscape plan which replaces the invasive species present within the 1 project site with large canopy trees and maintains all densely vegetated areas bordering Kuhio Highway, further allowing the structure to blend in with its surrounding environment. This draft EA proposes a finding of no significant impact. The key elements of this finding are as follows. 504629.1 Utilities, Infrastructure and Air Quality. Utilities, infrastructure and air quality are not materially impacted by the proposed dwelling, as the proposed improvement represents a small percentage of activity on this portion of Kuhio Highway and the broader Princeville area. Wastewater will be accommodated by an under ground, self\u00ad contained, extended aeration wastewater treatment system consistent with State Health Department requirements. Kuhio Highway is a paved road serving multiple residences and businesses. Drainage. The site appears to drain uniformly with no apparent ravines, defiles, indentations or drainages. There is no observable erosion occurring. The existing contours of the site will be maintained. Therefore, rainfall will generally be absorbed on the site and storm water flow will continue as under existing conditions. The Lot is located within Flood Zone X, an area determined to be outside the 0.2% annual chance floodplain. Historic and Cultural Sites. The proposed project will have no significant impact on historic or cultural sites. The Lot has been undeveloped except for old government road sections and includes an unidentified pre-contact rock formation located in a dense guava forest located on the ridge overlooking the Hanalei Valley. The Lot was checked for an old Chinese cemetery, which was said to be located on or near the Lot, but Kauai/Niihau Burial Council members and others who visited the Lot did not locate burials of any sort. HELIOS will be submitting to the State Historic Preservation Division (\"SHPD\") its Draft Archaeological Inventory Survey (\"AIS\") reviewing historic/cultural sites within the Lot concurrently with this EA will address the pre\u00ad contact historic property located in a dense guava grove on the Lot Components of the Final Preservation Plan may include designating the area surrounding the pre-contact historic property as a buff er zone. The proposed home site is more than 200 feet from the perimeter of the buffer zone. The AIS and Final Preservation Plan explicitly contemplate the construction of single-family dwellings on the project site. The AIS included a survey of the Lot, subsurface testing of the project site and clearing/sketch mapping of the pre-contact historic property and found no additional evidence of historic or archeologically significant structures in the project site area. Flora and Fauna. There will be a positive impact on flora and fauna in the project site and surrounding area. The project site is almost exclusively covered with invasive vegetation and there is no evidence of native animal species residing within the site. The proposed project's landscape plan calls for elimination of the invasive species in portions of the site, including the removal of strawberry guava, java plum and silver oak. 2 504629.1 Cliffside areas will remain densely forested to prevent erosion and sediment runoff and to reduce impacts to existing plants and animals. Visual and Aesthetic Resources. There will be minimal negative impact upon visual or aesthetic resources. Potentially impacted parties in this regard include residents of Hanalei Town and travelers and residents along Kuhio Highway. However, the choice of a site setback from the sloped edge of the Lot, the limitation of the dwelling to a single story, the choice of the dwelling's materials and colors and the plan for the surrounding foliage eliminate or adequately mitigate these potential impacts. 3 SECTION 1 BACKGROUND 1.1 INTRODUCTION Helios Hanalei LLC (\"HELIOS\") purchased the Lot (TMK No. (4) 5-4-004:032), in Princeville, Kauai, Hawaii from the Richard Carlson Living Trust in November 2016. The 14.109 acre Lot sits on a ridge on the east side of Hanalei Valley and is bordered on the north, west and south sides by Kuhio Highway (the principal transportation artery on the north and east shores of the island), on the east by the Hanalei National Wildlife Refuge. The Lot is located in the State Conservation District, Resource Subzone and within the Special Management Area (the \"SMA\"). For at least the last 50 years, the Lot has remained undeveloped and devoid of structures or improvements. HELIOS intends to apply to the Board of Land and Natural Resources for a Conservation District Use Permit (the \"COUP\") (i) to construct a single-family residence in the Conservation District under Hawaii Administrative Rules (\"HAR\") \u00a7\u00a713-5-24(c) R-7 and 13-5-41 and (ii) to remove invasive species and in their place to plant native and endemic plants and trees in the project site pursuant to HAR \u00a713-5-22(b) P-4 (B-1), HAR \u00a713-5- 22(b) P-13 (B-2) and HAR \u00a713-5-22(b) P-11 (B-1) (alternatively, this process would constitute Landscaping pursuant to HAR\u00a7 13-5-23(c) L-2 (D-1)) (collectively, the \"proposed project\"). As part of the approval process for the single-family residence, HAR \u00a713-5-31(a) requires submission of a Hawaii Revised Statutes (\"HRS\") Chapter 343 draft Environmental Assessment (\"EA\"). The Department of Land and Natural Resources Office of Conservation and Coastal Lands is the approving agency for the EA and the COUP. The proposed Conservation District single-family dwelling would be located on a gently sloping bluff (the \"proposed site\" or \"project site\") in the center of the western end of the Lot. Historically, the Lot has been left unused and with the relatively flat center portion where the house is to be located cleared and the balance densely vegetated predominately with invasive species. Presently, the built environment surrounding the proposed site includes a considerable amount of residential and other development, including the Princeville Shopping Center on the opposite (northeast) side of Kuhio Highway. 1.2 . PROPERTY LEGAL BACKGROUND The Lot is comprised of a portion of land covered by Land Patent Grant Number 4845 to Albert S. Wilcox; being a portion of the land deeded by Kamehameha IC to Charles Titcomb, Apana 2, February 12, 1856, and being a portion of Parcel 4-A. Historical uses of the Lot may have included pasture on the cleared portion, traditional travel to mauka/makai lands by trail or road (which may have traversed the Lot). Otherwise, the Lot has remained undeveloped and unused. The Lot boundaries were defined by the Kuhio Highway construction which likely happened in the 1940s. On November 1, 2016, HELIOS purchased the Lot from the Richard Carlson 4 504629.1 Revocable Trust dated December 14, 2004. The County of Kauai approved an SMA minor permit for the installation of a gate and rock wall at the entrance to the Lot on April 10, 2015. SMA(M)-2015-33 and CDUP KA-3729. The County of Kauai Water Department approved the installation of a water meter to serve the Lot and a Conveyance of Water Facility dated May 21, 2015 was recorded against the Lot in the Bureau of Conveyances as Document No. A-56870489. 1.3 SURROUNDING BIDLT ENVIRONMENT The built environment immediately surrounding the proposed site includes residential and commercial development, as well as community services providers. Hanalei Farms and Homesteads Directly across Kuhio Highway and surrounding the majority of the Lot are the Hanalei Garden Farms condominium and various homestead properties accessed from Kuhio Highway and Hanalei Plantation Road. These properties include homes, farm dwellings, other farm structures and agricultural activities. Hanalei Fire and Police Station The Hanalei Fire and Police Station, also known as Station 1, is located approximately 0.1 mile from the Lot. The County of Kauai Fire Department, Fire/Rescue/HazMat/Medical Response Operations program, provides fire protection and suppression, rescue ( ocean and land), hazmat and emergency medical services (basic life support) as well as pre-fire planning and inspection. Princeville Shopping Center and Princeville Resort The Princeville Shopping Center is located approximately 0.5 mile to the northeast of the Lot on Kuhio Highway. The Princeville Shopping Center includes a United States Post Office, Foodland grocery store, gasoline station and other shops and restaurants. Less than 1 mile east from the Lot is the entrance to the Princeville Resort, which includes the St. Regis Princeville Resort, various condominium and subdivision homes and the Makai Golf Course. Hanalei National Wildlife Refuge and Hanalei Scenic Overlook Established in 1972, Hanalei National Wildlife Refuge (\"Refuge\") is the oldest of Kaua'i's three national wildlife refuges and is owned and maintained by the United States Fish and Wildlife Service (\"USFWS\"). The 917-acre Refuge is located mainly in the Hanalei River Valley and extends upslope to abut the eastern end of the Lot. The Refuge was established under the Endangered Species Act to conserve five endangered water birds that rely on the Hanalei Valley for nesting and feeding habitat: the koloa maoli (Hawaiian duck), the and the 5 504629.1 nene (Hawaiian goose). Forty-five other species of birds (18 of which are introduced species) also utilize refuge habitat at some point throughout the year. The Refuge is not open for public access. Across Kuhio Highway from the Princeville Shopping Center, the scenic overlook of the Hanalei Valley provides public viewing of the Refuge and the valley. According to a draft 2002 Environmental Assessment of the a proposed relocation and expansion of the overlook, approximately 350 vehicles and four to ten tour busses were expected on the site daily (an estimated 900 visitors per day). A Kauai Island Utility Substation and transmission lines are located on the Refuge property near the eastern boundary of the Lot. Princeville Airport The Princeville Airport runway is approximately 2.5 miles east of the Lot. Although at present there are no regular commercial flights using the airport, there was regular commercial service in the past, which could be reintroduced. In addition, the airport is open to use by private aircraft and is regularly used by tour helicopters. SECTION 2 PROPOSED PROJECT AND NO ACTION ALTERNATIVE 2.1 THE PROPOSED PROJECT Helios is proposing to construct a single-family dwelling on the Lot which is located in the State Conservation District (Resource Subzone). The dwelling would be located on a gently sloping bluff (the \"proposed site\" or \"project site\") in the center of the western end of the Lot. The proposed site is relatively flat ( see topographic map included in Exhibit 1) and is covered with grasses and weeds with limited to no presence of native plant species. The site has been unused for at least the past 50 years. The Proposed Dwelling. The proposed single-family dwelling would be located at the western end of the Lot. The proposed dwelling would be a single-story structure with maximum height of 18 feet 1.5 inches above existing grade. The structure would have a finished living space under roof of 4,342 square feet and a pool and spa of 622 square feet, resulting in a \"total maximum developable area\" of 4,964 square feet (as reflected in Exhibit 1 ).1 The Topographic Map, the relevant Tax Map, Site Plans (including Landscape Plan) and Floor Plan for the residence are attached as Exhibit 1. Elevations showing the exterior of the dwelling, together with photographs of the project site with 20 foot story poles are included as Exhibit 1 . In addition, photographs from the perspective of various locations around Hanalei, including Waikoko, the Hanalei Pier, Hanalei Park and certain roads, are included in Exhibit 2 These photographs depict how the dwelling site would appear to the naked eye when viewed from the various points on the Hanalei Valley floor. Dwelling Exterior Finishes. The exterior walls of the dwelling are finished with teak siding (as 1 This total includes the footprint of the home ( whether or not living space), as well as, the pool, but excludes the driveway. 6 504629.1 shown in the elevations included in the Exhibit 1). Exterior windows and doors will be bronze tinted glass (as shown in Exhibit 1 ). Exterior columns are concrete and privacy garden walls are lava rock. The roof is cedar shake, as shown in Exhibit 1. The driveway will be crushed coral at the existing grade. The Landscape Plan. The Landscape Plan (included in Exhibit 1) calls for removal of a portion of the existing invasive species within the project site, the preservation of existing hala trees, and the planting of large canopy trees and other plants. (i) The project site would be planted with Royal Poinciana trees for large canopy, including within the circular driveway. Existing Strawberry guava, Silver oak and Java plum, all invasive species, will be removed. Hala trees within the project site will be maintained to preserve the Hawaiian sense of place. The existing pasture area will be maintained in its current closely mowed condition. (ii) The residence would have groupings of native loulu palms. (iii) Areas outside the project site (all areas bounding the Kuhio Highway) will remain as currently densely vegetated to maintain privacy and to prevent erosion of sloped areas. Wastewater. Wastewater from the dwelling will be addressed using an underground, self\u00ad contained, extended aeration wastewater treatment system which processes all wastewater This system is summarized in Exhibit 3. The wastewater system will comply with Department of Health requirements for wastewater disposal. Site Development -Excavation. The contours of the proposed site will not be altered, other than excavation of the area immediately beneath the proposed dwelling to accommodate its foundation and excavation of the pool. 2.2 NO ACTION ALTERNATIVE The No Action Alternative is included in the environmental analysis to provide a basis to compare the proposed project. In the No Action Alternative, there would be no disturbance of the existing environment. At present, many of the invasive species on the proposed site have been cut and grasses mowed. The No Action Alternative would permit invasive species existing on the site to once again spread on the site. 2.3 PROJECT LEGAL FRAMEWORK AND COMPLIANCE ANALYSIS Under HAR \u00a7\u00a713-5-24(c) and HAR 13-5-41, one single-family dwelling may be constructed upon land in the Conservation District with the approval of the BLNR. The dwelling may not be allowed, \"where there is an existing residence in a different state land use district zoned for residential, rural or agricultural use on another portion of the same legal lot of record\" (HAR \u00a713-5-4l(c)). The residence must meet design standards contained in HAR \u00a713-5 (HAR \u00a713-5-4l(a)). The design standards, among other things, 7 504629.1 limit the \"maximum developable area\" to 5,000 square feet for lots larger than one acre and limit the height of any part of the structure (with certain exceptions) to the \"maximum allowable building envelope\", which is 25 feet above the existing grade. A single-family dwelling must receive a Board Permit (HAR \u00a713-5-24(c)). A Board Permit, among other things, requires submittal of a draft or final EA (HAR \u00a713-5- 31(a)(l)). The Board Permit for a single-family dwelling in the Resource Subzone does not require a Public Hearing (HAR \u00a7 13-5-40(a)). There are no existing dwellings or structures, other than a rock wall and driveway gate, on the Lot. Accordingly, since there is no existing residence on portion of the Lot, the proposed single-family residence satisfies the requirements of HAR \u00a713-5-4l(b) and (c). The proposed dwelling complies with the \"compatibility provisions\" of HAR \u00a713-5. In particular: (i) landscaping will screen much of the structure from the perspective of Kuhio Highway, the dwelling will not be visible from Hanalei Town and, to the extent the dwelling would be visible from beaches, parks and roads within Hanalei Valley, the combination of foliage about the structure, setback from the sloped edges of the Lot, single story construction, and choice of materials for the roof and exterior walls will obscure the dwelling such that it will not be readily discernible to the naked eye from its surroundings; (ii) the roof will be cedar shake and the exterior walls teak paneling sufficient to blend with the environment; (iii) the waste water system will comply with and be approved by the Department of Health; (iv) the general contours of the proposed site will not be altered ( except for the construction within the area of the dwelling itself, the pool and spa; (v) only one dwelling will be constructed; (vi) all building and grading code requirements will be followed; and (vii) there will be only one kitchen. SECTION 3 PHYSICAL ENVIRONMENTAL SETTING, IMPACTS AND PROPOSED MITIGATION 3.1 TOPOGRAPHY, SOILS, GEOLOGY,RAINFALL Existing Condition Like many other valleys on Kauai, Hanalei Valley was created largely by stream erosion. It stretches from Hanalei Bay to Mount Waialeale, a distance of approximately ten miles. The valley is widest at the bay, narrowing inland. Alluvial deposits, and the effects of sea level changes helped form the valley's flat floor. Because of this flat terrain, and wetland conditions, the valley floor is presently used primarily for endangered water bird management by the US 8 504629.1 Fish and Wildlife Service as the Hanalei National Wildlife Refuge and wetland taro cultivation. The valley floor was also used to cultivate sugarcane, coffee and rice from the early 1800s through the 20th century. The Hanalei River, which meanders through the Hanalei Valley floor, is located approximately 150 feet from the southeastern comer of the Lot. The Hanalei River is the fourth largest stream in the State based upon the amount of water discharged (Stream Assessment Draft Report of 1990, State of Hawaii and National Park Service: 27) and, in 1998, was designated as one of seven American Heritage Rivers by Executive Order 13061. The Princeville area to the north of the Lot is in residential, commercial and resort uses. Princeville Shopping Center, directly to the northeast of the Lot, is the primary commercial resource center for the Princeville community. The Lot, located west of the Hanalei Valley Lookout, includes all of the land within the horseshoe curve of Kuhio Highway which leads down to the Hanalei River and Hanalei town. The Lot is currently vacant land with no improvements. The western end of the Lot is a gently sloping bluff. It has been cleared of woody vegetation and is maintained as a periodically mowed grass field. The Lot has a rock wall gated entry with a gravel driveway leading to the bluff area. Topography, Soils and Geology. The majority of the Lot is gently sloping terrain falling from approximately 471 feet of elevation to about 460 feet of elevation resulting in an overall maximum gradient of seven percent (7% ). This gently sloping bluff area is the planned site of the residence. The remainder of the Lot is steeply sloped and heavily forested. The Lot is located on an ancient wave-cut terrace underlain by lava flows associated with Mount Namahana, an extinct, secondary volcanic vent structurally connected to Mount Wai'ale'ale, the principal volcano that created the island of Kauai. The volcanic rocks have been altered by chemical processes to form thick zones of saprolite. The soil mantle overlying the saprolite formation is composed of a silty clay or silt assigned to the Makapili series. This soil is characterized by a low shrink/swell potential but high corrosion potentials with respect to uncoated steel and concrete. The erosion hazard is considered slight to moderate on slopes of the inclination typical of the bluff portion of the Lot. A Geotechnical Report dated May 22, 2017 was prepared by JPB Engineering, Inc. and is attached as Exhibit 4. A Phase I Environmental Assessment dated July 7, 2017 was prepared by Pacific Greene Environmental Inc and is attached as Exhibit 5. Slope mitigation work covering approximately 3 acres of the Lot was done by the State of Hawaii pursuant to a Right of Entry Agreement dated August 16, 2004 recorded against the Lot as Document No. 2006-085546. This Right of Entry granted the State temporary use of a portion of the Lot for slope mitigation work along Kuhio Highway for protection of the highway. A Grant of Easement to the State of Hawaii granted Slope Easement 1 for the maintenance of the slope mitigation work and recorded as Document No. 2010-000301. The physical improvements of this mitigation work consist mainly of anchors, cables and steel mesh netting. More information on the slope stabilization work can be for in the Final Environmental 9 504629.1 Assessment Kuhio Highway Slope Stabilization January 2009. Rainfall; Ground Water. The parcel receives approximately 78 inches of annual rainfall (University of Hawaii Rainfall Atlas). There is no evidence of significant surface flows to the Lot originating from neighboring properties. There may be some drainage from Kuhio Highway on the northeast side of the Lot. Test borings on the Lot showed no free ground water. The Lot may have seeps and springs but none have been observed. The project site is rated Flood Zone X. Zone Xis a Special Flood Hazard Area determined to be outside the 500-year floodplain as shown on the FIRM Map attached hereto as Exhibit 6. Flood insurance purchases are not required. The nearest floodplain is within Hanalei Valley. Potential Impacts and Mitigation The Proposed Project Topography. The dwelling and surrounding landscaping will be designed to conform to the existing contours of the project site and not materially alter the existing topography. The only permanent alteration of the site's contours will be for the foundation of the dwelling itself and for the pool and spa. The Landscape Plan will not require any material modification of the existing terrain or excavation. Soils and Geology. The proposed dwelling will not change the soils of the project site or the surrounding areas. Rainfall, Drainage and Natural Hazards. The existing contours of the site will be maintained. Therefore, rainfall will generally be absorbed on the site and storm water in extreme conditions will flow direction discharging to Kuhio Highway, as under the existing circumstances. Slope mitigation work covering approximately 3 acres of the Lot within the drainage area was done by the State of Hawaii pursuant to a Right of Entry Agreement dated August 16, 2004 recorded against the Lot as Document No. 2006-085546. The proposed project will not increase the risk of natural hazards (i.e., landslides) due to the very limited alteration of site drainage, location of the dwelling on the level portion of the Lot and the existing slope stabilization improvements which will remain in place. No Action The No Action Alternative would not change the existing topography, soils, drainage or natural hazards of the project site. 3.2 WATER RESOURCES Existing Condition The project site contains no surface water bodies or wetlands. A botanical survey of the site 10 504629.1 found no evidence of wetland vegetation. The surface water bodies nearest to the project site are Hanalei River, which meanders along the valley floor to the south of the Lot, and the river's adjacent wetlands. The river is designated a National Heritage River. The Hawaii Stream Assessment (1990) evaluated Hanalei River as having outstanding aquatic natural resources. The valley wetlands are used to cultivate taro and provide habitat for endangered water birds. The nearest coastline, Hanalei Bay, is approximately 1.3 miles distant. Princeville Resort has an irrigation pond associated with the golf course that is located approximately 0.5 mile from the Lot. The County of Kauai Water Department approved the installation of a water meter to serve the Lot and a Conveyance of Water Facility dated May 21, 2015 was recorded against the Lot in the Bureau of Conveyances as Document No. A-56870489. There are no groundwater wells or injection wells on the Lot. Potential Impacts and Mitigation Proposed Project The proposed project will have no significant direct or indirect impact on the Hanalei River, the adjacent valley wetlands or the coastal waters (including Hanalei Bay). Potable water will be supplied to the Lot by a County of Kauai Water Department approved water meter. No Action The No Action Alternative would not impact the Hanalei River, the Hanalei Valley wetlands or the coastal waters because this alternative would propose no construction. 3.3 FLORA Existing Condition The vegetation covering the eastern two-thirds of the Lot is mostly mixed, secondary forest with a generally sparse understory. Between the Kuhio highway verge of the upper arm of the loop and the steep slopes along the lower arm is a closed or nearly closed canopy forest of mostly introduced tree species: mango (Mangifera indica), avocado, gunpowder tree (Terma orientalis). Also common in this area are native or Polynesian-introduced (\"canoe plants\") hala (Pandanus and hau (hibiscus tilaceus). Much of the project area on the western third of the Lot has been cleared and is close-cropped grassy field with a few scattered trees. This area was once covered in strawberry guava (Psidium cattleianum) scrubland. This scrubland extended over much of the western third of 11 504629.1 the Lot and surrounds the project area. A portion of the west-facing slope, extending below the project area to the highway, supports a mixture of trees and mostly shrubs, with wait-a-bit (Caesalpinia decapetala) prominent. Scattered ornamentals are present, planted especially along the residence entrance driveway. A Natural Resources Surveys report, dated June 14, 2017, was prepared by AECOS, Inc. It is attached as Exhibit 7. Between surveys conducted in 2008 and 2017, 12 species of fems and 120 taxa of flowering plants were identified on the Lot, representing all plants identified in both surveys. Four of the 12 species of fems identified are native species (indigenous or endemic). Among the flowering plants, 6 indigenous and no endemics are listed. Early Polynesian introductions total 5 flowering plants. None of these species is considered rare in the Hawaiian Islands. Potential Impacts and Mitigation Proposed Project The proposed project's Landscape Plan would positively impact the project site flora. No species that is listed by the state or federal governments endangered species statutes or considered a candidate species, or is rare, or is of any special concern was observed at the Lot. Therefore, no mitigation measures are proposed based on specifics of the observed flora. The Lot does support a number of old hala trees that provide an ambiance of a Hawaiian sense of place and these trees will be preserved to the extent possible. These trees are sparsely scattered around the project area and are prominent in parts of the steep\u00ad sloped eastern half of the Lot away from the project area. The plan proposes continued control of invasive plant species covering the project site and the reintroduction of some native species. No Action The property remains dominated by invasive grasses, shrubs and trees which will be permitted to spread throughout the Lot. 3.4 FAUNA Existing Condition During stationary point-counts, nine species were observed utilizing the Lot and an additional five species were encountered while traversing the Lot between count stations: Spotted Dove (Streptopelia Hawaiian Goose or nene (Branta sandvicensis) is common in nearby Hanalei National Wildlife Refuge and around the Princeville golf courses. Two seabirds -the Hawaiian newelli) -regularly fly over the region but were not observed during the survey. No mammals nor signs of their presence were detected on the Lot during the survey. A domestic dog (Canis l. familiaris) was heard barking, the sound originating from houses north of the Lot, across Kuhio Highway. The Hawaiian hoary bat (Lasiurus cinerius semotus) is an endangered species that is fairly common in the lowlands of Kauai. Although not detected during the course of surveying the Lot, it is likely that this endangered species uses resources in the general area. Hawaiian hoary bats are foliage\u00ad roosting, over-disbursed mammals; that is, they roost in low numbers widely separated from one another. A Natural Resources Surveys report, dated June 14, 2017, was prepared by AECOS, Inc. It is attached as Exhibit 7. Potential Impacts and Mitigation Proposed Project The proposed project will not adversely impact fauna in the area of the project site. To the contrary, the introduction of large blooming canopy trees may provide harborage and forage for native forest bird species. Also, maintenance of the project area in short grass will provide harborage for native birds, including the Koloa, and Nene, both common in the Princeville and Hanalei area. The proposed project is also not anticipated to adversely impact threatened or endangered species. Removal of vegetation within the Lot may temporarily displace bats using trees for roosting. However, these bats use multiple roosts within their home territories and disturbance from the removal of a roosting tree is likely to be minimal. An exception is the removal of trees during the bat pupping season. The following recommendations are planned for the project: Exterior lighting will be shielded to reduce interactions with Hawaiian petrels and Newell's shearwaters moving between inland nesting sites and the ocean. To the extent that trees taller than 15 feet will be removed, which trees may provide roosting sites for Hawaiian hoary bats, this action will be scheduled for periods not within the Hawaiian hoary bat pupping season of June 1 through September 15. No Action Alternative 13 504629.1 Under the No Action Alternative, the project site would repopulate with invasive species with limited harborage and forage for native species, including the regrowth of dense vegetation within the currently mowed areas. 3.5 AIR QUALITY AND NOISE Existing Condition HELIOS is not aware of any air quality issues concerning the proposed site. Additionally, there are no industrial sources of noise near the project site, other than periodic construction activity. Potential Impacts and Mitigation Proposed Project During construction, noise at the proposed site will be the typical levels associated with construction of a single-family dwelling and related improvements and HELIOS will comply with all applicable legal and regulatory requirements related to noise levels. Once the dwelling is completed, noise emissions will be minimal and impacts to neighboring properties will not be significant. Once constructed, the types of noise that will be generated at the dwelling would include cars moving in and out of the site and the periodic operation of landscaping maintenance equipment, such as lawnmowers, blowers, etc. Periodic use of such equipment is common within the project neighborhood. During construction of the proposed dwelling, BMPs will be used to minimize any dust or similar air borne material and HELIOS will comply with all applicable legal and regulatory requirements related to air pollution control and fugitive dust emissions. Once the proposed dwelling is completed, the dwelling and vehicles entering and exiting the dwelling will have no significant impact on pollutant air emissions. No Action The No Action Alternative would not change existing noise levels or pollutant air emissions. 3.6 UTILITIESANDROADS Existing Condition There is no sewer service along this portion of Kuhio Highway. State Health Department regulations require that a septic system may not be located within 1,000 feet of a public potable water well. Potable water for residences along this portion of Kuhio Highway is provided by the Kauai 14 504629.1 County Department of Water. Installation of water meter facilities has been approved by the Department of Water and a Conveyance of Water Facility was recorded in the Bureau of Conveyances as Document No. A-56870489 on July 28, 2015. Kauai Island Utility Cooperative (\"KIUC\") provides electric power service to this area of Kuhio Highway. Kuhio Highway is a public road owned by the State of Hawaii. Potential Impacts and Mitigation Proposed Project The proposed dwelling does not materially impact utilities and roads. The County of Kauai does not provide wastewater treatment services to this area. Domestic waste water from the proposed dwelling would be processed by an underground, self\u00ad contained, extended aeration wastewater treatment system. The system will be in compliance with State Department of Health and County requirements. Installation of water meter facilities has been approved by the Department of Water and a Conveyance of Water Facility was recorded in the Bureau of Conveyances as Document No. A-56870489 on July 28, 2015. KIUC has approved plans for electrical service to the proposed dwelling. The addition of the residence should have no material impact on wear of or traffic on Kuhio Highway. No Action The No Action Alternative would not change the existing use of utilities and roads. SECTION 4 SOCIAL ENVIRONMENTAL SETTING,IMPACTS AND PROPOSED MITIGATION 4.1 POPULATION CHARACTERISTICS Existing Condition The town of Princeville was developed starting in the late 1960s. It includes two major hotels (the St. Regis Princeville and the Westin), over 1,500 time-share and condominium properties, and over 700 single-family residences. Princeville's population in 2010 was 2,158. Princeville includes a commercial area, the 74,000 square foot Princeville Shopping Center, which includes a 24,666 square foot Foodland supermarket, an ACE Hardware store and numerous other small businesses and restaurants. 15 504629.1 Hanalei is a much older community. The community had approximately 300 residences in 2010. The area often referred to as Hanalei Town supports a small commercial district with shops, restaurants and other businesses. The remainder of the Hanalei Valley is very rural and scenic and includes a National Wildlife Refuge, some residences and taro farms. The County of Kaua'i General Plan projects a resident population ranging from between 65,300 to 82,800 for the year 2020 based on data from the 1990s (section 1.6.2.2 County of Kauai General Plan). The U.S. Census Bureau for 2010 estimates the population for 2020 to be 75,640 residents, which is slightly more than the maximum projection from 1997 (Table 2-1). Potential Impacts and Mitigation Proposed Project The addition of a single-family residence in Princeville will have no material impact on population metrics of the area. No Action The No Action Alternative does not impact population metrics. 4.2 TRAFFIC CONDITIONS Existing Condition The Lot and the project site are located on Kuhio, a State-owned, paved road. Kuhio Highway in this vicinity has numerous commercial structures, residential dwellings and other structures, located along it, including the Princeville Shopping Center and Hanalei Fire and Police Station. Hanalei Plantation Road intersects with Kuhio Highway opposite from the northern boundary of the Lot and adjacent to the Hanalei Fire and Police Station. The Lot has a long used State approved driveway entrance onto Kuhio Highway. Potential Impacts and Mitigation Proposed Project The introduction of one single family dwelling to the community will have no significant impact on existing traffic conditions on Kuhio Highway. The incremental use associated with the proposed single-family dwelling is not consequential. No Action The No Action Alternative will not alter existing use of Kuhio Highway. 4.3 HISTORIC AND CULTURAL PROPERTIES Existing Condition 16 504629.1 The adjacent Kuhio Highway, also known as the Kauai Belt Road, is on the National Register of Historic Places, as is the nearby Hanalei Bridge. Their applicable criteria include A (property associated with events that have made a significant contribution to the broad pattern of our history) and C (property embodies the distinctive characteristics of a type, period, or method of construction or represents the work of a master, or possesses high artistic values, or represents a significant and distinguishable entity whose components lack individual distinction) with significance for engineering, social history, transportation and commerce. The Kuhio Highway between Princeville and Ha' ena is part of the original belt road system and retains its historic significance and character in its location, alignment, design, setting and association. The project will not affect the location, alignment, design, setting or association of the historic roadway as the improvements on the Lot will be minimally visible from the roadway and no alterations will be made to the Kuhio Highway. An Archaeological Inventory Survey (\"AIS\") covering the Lot, was completed in July 2017 by Exploration Associates, Ltd and is attached as Exhibit 8. No cultural materials or historic properties were found during the surface and subsurface work in the project area. The AIS noted - 504629.1 The project area is defined as the single-family residence including the swimming pool and ancillary improvements. Currently the project area is fairly level and maintained in grass. Subsurface testing (6 backhoe trenches) were placed in the location of the proposed development. No cultural material or historic properties were found during the surface and subsurface work in the project area. Within the parcel, two historic properties were identified: Old Government Road portion (50-30-03-02353) and a pre-contact historic structure comprised of a rock formation (50-30-03-02354). The location of these historic properties is well outside of the development area but on the Lot. SIHP# 50-30-03-2353 is an old road documented as significant under criteria D (for its information content. From the historic documentation, this road appears to be built before 1833. Its use was mostly abandoned when the new Kauai Belt Road was constructed. Occasionally it was used as an emergency route. No further work is recommended for this historic property but because of its location, it is being indirectly being preserved \"as is\". SIHP# 50-30-03-02354 is an approximately 15 x 7-meter pre-contact historic property located in a dense area of guava forest near the northern point of the property. SIHP# 50-30-03-02354 is significant under multiple criteria D and E (E being significant to the Native Hawaiian culture). Four features have been identified with that historic property. Two mounds, one rock wall and several rough stones outline 17 a rough boundary of the historic property. A preservation plan is recommended for this historic property, with further detailed mapping with appropriate buffers and will be maintained by the owner. The State Historic Preservation Division has recommended a preservation plan including a buffer zone to safeguard the pre-contact historic property from future adverse activities in the surrounding area, which Helios has agreed to implement. In setting the buffer zone, the AIS and preservation plan expressly considered planned residential dwelling. An cultural impact assessment was also conducted for this parcel. No traditional cultural practices have been documented for this property. Interviews with informants stated that in modem times the area did have some occasional pig hunting, guava and sisal collecting and cannabis growing. It was a heavily overgrown area and most informants did not recall much about the area and had little access nor reason to frequent that parcel. A few informants mentioned they thought there was a Chinese cemetery and other informants stated there was an ahu or heiau on this parcel. The cultural impact assessment can be found in Exhibit 9. Potential Impacts and Mitigation Proposed Project There should be no significant impact on historic or cultural sites. As mentioned, the AIS identified no historic properties or structures on the project site. The buffer zone around the pre-contact historic structure safeguards the historic preserve from uses of the Lot, including construction activities. No Action The No Action Alternative would not impact historic properties and would leave the pre\u00ad contact historic property overgrown and undistinguishable. 4.4 VISUAL AND AESTHETIC RESOURCES: IMP ACT ON THE AREA Existing Condition Kuhio Highway borders three sides of the Lot. There are currently no dwellings on the Lot. Extensive residential, community and commercial development on Kuhio Highway exists to the northeast of the Lot, including: 504629.1 (i) the Princeville Shopping Center; (ii) the Hanalei Fire and Police Station; and (iii) multiple farms and residences on Hanalei Plantation Road which runs perpendicular to Kuhio Highway. 18 One residence is planned for the Lot. The residence will be only minimally visible from Kuhio Highway, including the nearby Hanalei Valley lookout. Analysis/Mitigation Proposed Proiect The proposed project will have no significant impact on the neighborhood in this area of Kuhio Highway. One residence is planned for the Lot. Accordingly, there will be no further residential development within the 14.109 acres comprising the Lot. The proposed dwelling is only one story with a maximum height of 18 feet 1.5 inches. The home will be set within the dense vegetation bordering Kuhio Highway, which will remain undisturbed. Given the vegetation along Kuhio Highway and around the residence and the roofing and exterior materials used, the proposed residence will blend into its surroundings and will be largely obscured to passing vehicle and pedestrian traffic on Kuhio Highway. Given the proximity to the busy Princeville Shopping Center, Hanalei Fire and Police Station and multiple other residences, this portion of Kuhio Highway is not a pristine, natural preserve; it is a developed residential and commercial area. The proposed home is also at the far end of the Lot from the boundary of the Hanalei National Wildlife Refuge. As a result, the proposed single-family dwelling will have no material impact on the overall visual appearance of the area in terms of its existing \"natural\" condition. With respect to natural foliage, the area has been largely overtaken by invasive vegetation. No Action The No Action Alternative would not change the existing state of the area. Invasive vegetation would continue to populate and spread in and around the proposed site. 4.5 VISUAL AND AESTHETIC RESOURCES: IMP ACT ON IMMEDIATELY ADJACENT PARCELS Existing Condition There are no dwellings or businesses immediately across Kuhio Highway from the proposed site in any direction. There are three (3) residences, the Hanalei Fire and Police Station and other undeveloped parcels immediately across Kuhio Highway from other portions of the Lot. Analysis/ Mitigation Proposed Proiect Due to the dense vegetation abutting Kuhio Highway, the proposed dwelling will not be visible 19 504629.1 from the three (3) residences, the Hanalei Fire and Police Station across the street. The dwelling will be partially visible, although mostly obscured by vegetation from undeveloped parcels below Kuhio Highway in Hanalei Valley. The impact on these undeveloped parcels depends in part on their future use, if any, but would be minimal in any event. No Action The No Action Alternative would not change the existing state of the area. Invasive vegetation would continue to populate and spread in and around the proposed site. 4.6 VISUAL AND AESTHETIC RESOURCES: IMPACT ON VIEWS FROM THE HANALEI VALLEY FLOOR Existing Condition There are several taro farms on the Hanalei Valley floor below the Lot. The Kuhio Highway runs east-west across the valley floor from Princeville to Hanalei. Ohiki Road runs south from the highway up the valley, providing access to the taro farms and USFWS property in the valley, including the Hanalei National Wildlife Refuge. Analysis/Mitigation Proposed Project Given the location of the project site along the Hanalei Valley rim, there are limited locations within the valley floor, Hanalei Town or its nearby beaches which could potentially see the proposed dwelling. By limiting the dwelling to one story (with a maximum height of 18 feet 1.5 inches) and by setting back the structure 5 to 100 feet from the sloped portion of the Lot, the dwelling's visibility from these locations on the valley floor is substantially mitigated if not eliminated. In addition, even if a portion of the dwelling or its roof could be observed from valley farms or roadways, the dwelling's impact is further mitigated by using cedar shake roofing, teak siding on the walls, lava rock privacy garden walls and foliage around the dwelling which breaks the dwelling's roof lines. These mitigating measures prevent any visible portion of the structure from standing out from its natural surroundings. The mitigating effect of these design features is demonstrated by the photographs of the proposed site from various locations around Hanalei, including Waikoko, the Hanalei Pier, Hanalei Park and certain roads, are included in Exhibit 2. Each photograph is marked with the dwelling location and some have a rendering of the proposed dwelling superimposed on the site. The photographs depict how the proposed dwelling would appear to the naked eye from these points on the valley floor. These photographs include the existing dense vegetation surrounding the project area but do not include the large canopy trees which will be planted pursuant to the Landscape Plan. 20 504629.1 For purposes of comparison, it should be noted that there are numerous dwellings along Hanalei Plantation Road, particularly in the Hanalei Garden Farms development which includes 22 home sites. Several of these dwellings are readily visible from the Hanalei Valley floor and Hanalei Town. There is further development planned at the northernmost end of the Hanalei Valley rim overlooking Hanalei Bay including more than 30 dwellings and a new hotel proposed to be constructed on the former Club Med site. At night, it is possible the proposed dwelling's lights could be seen from parts of the Hanalei Valley floor (note, hundreds of lights in Hanalei are visible from the eastern valley rim). This impact would be mitigated by the surrounding vegetation, the residence's setback within the Lot, compliance with down lighting requirements for all exterior lights and the Landscape Plan's use of foliage. No Action The No Action Alternative would not change the appearance of the project site. SECTION 5 CUMULATIVE IMPACTS Cumulative impacts are two or more individual effect's which, when considered together, compound or increase the overall impact. The cumulative impacts of implementing the proposed project along with past and reasonably foreseeable future projects on the Lot are assessed based upon current available information. There are no construction projects planned for the Lot, other than the proposed single-family dwelling project. Accordingly, there are no cumulative impacts to be considered. SECTION 6 CONSISTENCY WITH GOVERNMENTAL PLANS, POLICIES AND CONTROLS This section summarizes the relationship of governmental plans and policies to the proposed project. 6.1 HAWAII STATE PLANNING ACT The Hawai'i State Planning Act, HRS Chapter 226 (the \"State Plan\"), was developed as a guideline for the future growth of the State of Hawai'i. The State Plan identifies goals, objectives, policies, and priorities for the development and growth of the State. It provides a basis for prioritizing and allocating limited resources such as public funds, services, human resources, land, energy, and water. The State Plan establishes a system for the formulation and program coordination of State 21 504629.1 and County plans, policies, programs, projects, and regulatory activities. The State Plan also facilitates the integration of all major State and County activities. The proposed project is consistent with the following objectives and policies of the State Plan: HRS \u00a7226-13 Objectives and policies for the physical environment -land, air, and water quality. *** (b) To achieve the land, air, and water quality objectives, it shall be the policy of this State to: *** (7). ~i:icourage urban developments in close proximity to existing services and fac1ht1es. . The County of Kauai General Plan (2000) recognizes the Princeville community as \"the only North Shore community that provides the full range of urban-level services, including wastewater treatment. \"2 The proposed project would be developed within close proximity to urban services of the Princeville area, including potable water and electric service, and would therefore be consistent with the policy of encouraging urban development within the meaning of HRS 226-13 (b )(7). 3 6.2 HAWAIISTATELANDUSELAW HRS Chapter 205 articulates the Hawaii State Land Use Law. This law is intended to preserve, protect, and encourage the development of lands in the State of Hawai'i for uses that are best suited to the public health and welfare of its people, and classifies all land into four districts: Urban, Conservation, Agriculture, and Rural. The Conservation district has five subzones: Protective, Limited, Resource, General and Special. These subzones define a set of identified land uses which may be allowed by a discretionary permit. The proposed project is situated in the Resource subzone of the Conservation District. Hawai'i Administrative Rules, Title 13, Department of Land and Natural Resources, Subtitle 1 Administration, Chapter 5, Conservation District, Subchapter 2, Subzones states in relevant part: \u00a713-5-13 Resource (R) subzone. ( a) The objective of this subzone is to ensure, with proper management, the sustainable use of the natural resources of those areas. (b) The(R) subzone shall encompass: ( 1) Lands necessary for providing future parkland and lands presently used for national, state, county, or private parks; 2 Section 6.1.4.3, Kauai General Plan. 3 The proposed project is outside of the Princeville Utilities and County of Kauai sewerage service area; as such, the project will use an underground, self-contained, extended aeration wastewater treatment system (this system is summarized in Exhibit 1). This system will comply with applicable State Department of Health requirements for individual wastewater systems 22 504629.1 (2) Lands suitable for growing and harvesting of commercial timber or other forest products; (3) Lands suitable for outdoor recreational uses such as hunting, fishing, hiking, camping, and picnicking; ( 4) Offshore islands of the State of Hawai 'i, unless placed in a ( P) or ( L) sub zone; ( 5) Lands and state marine waters seaward of the upper reaches of the wash of waves, usually evidenced by the edge or vegetation or by the debris left by the wash of waves on shore to the extent of the State's jurisdiction, unless placed in a (P) or (L) subzone. (c) Identified land uses in the resource (R) subzone are restricted to those listed in section 13-5- 24. \u00a713-5-24 Identified land uses in the resource subzone. (c)Identified land uses in the resource subzone and their required permits (if applicable), are listed below: R-7 SINGLE FAMILY RESIDENCE (D-1) A single family residence that conforms to design standards as outlined in this chapter. 11111 1111111111 11111111111111111111111 TTITTT JIIJIIIHIIII Analysis. The construction of one single-family dwelling, conforming with the applicable design standards referenced in HAR \u00a713-5-41, on the Lot is a reasonable and beneficial use of the project site, consistent with the objectives of the Conservation District and the Resource subzone. The development of a single dwelling on the Lot is consistent with the development in the surrounding neighborhood (see the detailed discussion in sections 4.4 and 4.5 of this document). The Landscape Plan improves the condition of the proposed site by preventing the spread of invasive species, as well as, promoting harborage and forage for native bird species. 504629.1 Currently, the proposed site is dominated by invasive species which are spreading throughout the site. The proposed project's Landscape Plan would remove invasive plants, add large canopy trees, preserve existing hala trees and maintain the mowed grass pasture areas. The maintenance of open and mowed grass areas will provide harborage and forage for native bird species, including the Kolea and Nene. These native birds are currently found in the surrounding areas and are likely to utilize the Lot. If the proposed project is not undertaken, the proposed site remains degraded forest dominated by invasive grasses, shrubs and trees, which will continue to slowly spread throughout the project site, eventually filling in the mowed areas and eliminating the open fields potentially useful to Kolea and Nene. C) After development of the proposed site, no further dwellings are permissible in the Conservation District. Accordingly, the remaining 23 portions of the Lot will remain open, consistent with the Conservation District's overall goal of conservation and preservation. HELIOS's long-term plans for the remaining acreage in Lot includes various remedial efforts, such as preservation of specified areas for (i) hiking, (ii) planting of native foliage, and (iii) recreational space. These improvements would be in furtherance of the specific objectives of HAR \u00a713-5-13(b)(l) and (b)(3). D) In sum, the proposed use is consistent with the overall goal of preservation. No long-term negative impacts to the physical or social environment are anticipated as a result of the proposed project. No significant change to the topography of the site will occur. No valuable natural or cultural resource would be adversely affected or lost. No native ecosystems are present. 6.3 COUNTY OF KAUAI GENERAL PLAN The County of Kauai General Plan (the \"General Plan\") presents the County's v1s1on for Kauai and establishes strategies for achieving that vision. The strategies are expressed in terms of policies and implementing actions. Chapter 2 of the General Plan, Vision for Kauai 2020, at section 2.1 describes various community values, including the following: Protection, management, and enjoyment of our open spaces, unique natural beauty, rural lifestyle, outdoor recreation and parks. Balanced management of our built environment, clustering new development around existing communities and maintaining the four-story height limit. Chapter 6 of the General Plan, Enhancing Towns & Communities and Providing for Growth, addresses, among other things, the \"location and character of future residential and commercial growth\" (page 6-1, Chapter 6 General Plan). Section 6.1.4.2 Policies states in part: 504629.1 (a) The North Shore shall remain primarily a rural, agricultural area, with resort use and other urban development concentrated in Princeville. The towns of Hanalei and Kilauea shall also provide for housing and other urban uses. ( c) Princeville Mauka. The intent is to provide an urban village to consist primarily of affordable housing, with a commercial area for resident shopping and services and sites for a new elementary school and/or a middle school. A site near the airport will provide for light industrial use. 24 Section 6.1.4.3 Rationale for Map and Text Policies of the General Plan states in relevant part: Princeville. The Princeville re-designation continues the longstanding strategy of concentrating North Shore development at Princeville. It is the only North Shore community that provides the full range of urban-level services, including wastewater treatment ..... Mauka of the highway, the light industrial site will provide space for North Shore businesses and fulfill a prior condition of zoning. Princeville Corporation intends the 'Mauka Village\" to provide affordable housing to satisfy County and State housing requirements ..... Unlike the makai resort/residential community, the Mauka Village will be oriented to local residents. . . . Princeville will serve the village with its privately-operated water and wastewater treatment systems. Analysis. The proposed construction of one dwelling on this otherwise unimproved 14 acre lot will maintain and preserve the rural character of the North Shore community which the General Plan seeks to maintain. At the same time, it is consistent with the General Plan's strategy of concentrating further North Shore development at Princeville, given Princeville is the only North Shore community providing a full range of urban-level services. The proposed project's specific location places it in a largely-residential and commercial community along this portion of Kuhio Highway. Therefore, the proposed project is consistent with the community value of clustering new development around existing communities described in Chapter 2 of the General Plan, Vision for Kauai 2020. Chapter 3 of the General Plan, Caring for the Land, Water and Culture, sets policies relating to \"Heritage Resources\" including resources connected to \"the visual experience of the environment\" (section 3.1, General Plan). Section 3 .1.1 Heritage Resources Map describes 'Heritage Resource Maps\" appended to the General Plan which \"document important natural, scenic and historic features\" of the island. The Heritage Resources Map for the North Shore of Kauai identifies scenic roadway corridors along Kuhio Highway. See Exhibit 10. Section 3.2.1 Policy provides in part: 504629.1 (a) In developing public facilities and in administering land use regulations, the County shall seek to preserve scenic resources and public views. Public views are those from a public place, such as a park, highway or along the shoreline. (b) The County shall observe the following general principles in maintaining scenic resources: (1) Preserve public views that exhibit a high degree of intactness or vividness. \"Intactness\" refers to both the integrity of visual patterns and 25 to the extent to which the landscape is free from structures or other visually encroaching features. \"Vividness\" relates to the memorability of a view, caused by contrasting landforms which create striking and distinctive patterns. (Examples are the silhouette of Mt. Ha'upu against the horizon, views of N onou Mountain from the valley and the coast, and the view of Hanalei Valley from the overlook.) (2) Preserve the scenic qualities of mountains, hills and other elevated landforms, qualities such as the silhouette against the horizon and the mass and shape of the landform. (3) Structures should not impede or intrude upon public views of the feature and should not alter the character of the immediate area around the land feature. Section 3.2.2 Rationale provides in part: As discussed herein, the intent is to preserve public views -i.e., views seen from a park, the beach, a road or some other public place. The term does not include private views -i.e., views from one's residence or other private property. ( emphasis in original). As an example, consider a hill which is an important landmark for residents in the surrounding community . . . If a person purchased the land and built a house high up on that hill, he would have a dominating view. But the owner's private view would be achieved at the expense of many other residents' and visitors' enjoyment and appreciation of the landscape. Of course, the owner should be able to build a house on property he purchased for that purpose. But he should not be allowed to site his house so that it interferes with an important local landmark. Instead, the County should provide clearly-stated land use regulations that require a formal view analysis and placement of structures in locations that do not have a significant impact on public views. Analysis. The proposed project sits within the roadway view corridor of the Kuhio Highway identified in the Heritage Resources Map and but is not visible from Kuhio Highway and does not impact the views from Kuhio Highway because the Lot is located above Kuhio Highway and not below it. As discussed in sections 4.4, 4.5 and 4.6, the project does not substantially impede or intrude upon public views of the valley rim and does not impact the views of the Hanalei Valley from the rim. Finally, if the proposed project impacted the views of residential homeowners across Kuhio Highway (which it does not), such impacts would be to private views as defined under the General Plan and therefore not be within the scope of chapter 3 of the General Plan. 6.4 NORTH SHORE DEVELOPMENT PLAN UPDATE (1980) 26 504629.1 The North Shore Development Plan Update (1980) (the \"North Shore Plan\") identifies land suitable for residential expansion as those lands which are not included in tsunami inundation and flood hazard areas; are not considered prime or productive ag lands; do not adversely affect coastal or ground water quality; do not affect important wildlife habitats; do not adversely affect scenic, historic, or recreational resources; and are serviceable by existing utilities and public services (Section LC., Summary of Findings and Recommendations -Growth, North Shore Plan, page 4). The North Shore Plan's \"Recommendations\" (pages 43-44 ), state in relevant part, that: 1. Scenic views should not be adversely affected by man-made improvements. 2. Scenic views from Kuhio Highway should be protected and enhanced. (Section IV. C.l. Scenic/Historic, North Shore Plan, page 44) Section IV. C.l. Scenic/Historic (page 43) refers to a map of \"Historic, Scenic & Recreational Resources\" appended to the North Shore Plan. The map identifies numerous scenic view planes most of which are along Kuhio Highway and almost all of which are makai-facing. Those view planes which do face mauka are distant from the proposed site. Section IV (page 43) also references an additional list of historic and scenic features contained in the North Shore Special Planning Area Report, 1972. This report's list of outstanding scenic features includes the \"magnificent mountains in the background of the Hanalei Valley.\" Various other narrative sections of the North Shore Plan affirm that scenic views should not be adversely affected by man-made improvements, that scenic views from Kuhio Highway should be protected and enhanced, and state that residences should be constructed away from Kuhio Highway, and landscaped to minimize their visual impact. Analysis. The proposed project will not impact any view planes specifically identified in the North Shore Plan including views from the Kuhio Highway corridor, views identified in the \"Historic, Scenic & Recreational Resources\" map ( appended to the North Shore Plan) and views identified in the North Shore Special Planning Area Report, 1972. Additionally, as discussed in sections 4.4, 4.5 and 4.6 of this document, the proposed project will have no significant adverse impact on views of the Hanalei Valley rim. 6.5 KAUA'I COUNTY CODE, COMPREHENSIVE ZONING ORDINANCE The purpose of the County's Comprehensive Zoning Ordinance (\"CZO\") is to regulate and provide standards for land development and the construction of buildings and other structures in the County of Kaua' i. The regulations and standards prescribed in the CZO are intended to regulate development to ensure its compatibility with the overall character of the island. As the proposed project is located within the State's Conservation District: Resource 27 504629.1 Sub zone, the State, not the County, has jurisdiction and authority over approval of permits for residential uses within the district; therefore, the CZO does not address development of the proposed project. SECTION 7 PERMITS AND APPROVALS The following permits are required to develop a single-family dwelling on the Lot: Conservation District Use Permit (\"COUP\") from the State DLNR Office of Conservation and Coastal Lands; Building Permit from the County of Kauai (\"County\"); Grubbing permit from the County for clearing the footprint area of the home; Driveway Approach Permit from the County for a driveway connection with Kuhio Highway; County Department of Public Works (\"DPW\") permit to bring electric conduit from KIUC line across Kuhio Highway; and County permit for any work requiring traffic management on Kuhio Highway during construction of the proposed dwelling (none expected to be required). SECTION 8 COMMENTS AND COORDINATION Community meetings and consultation concerning the proposed project began in 2016 and will continue through the Environmental Assessment, Conservation District Use Permit and construction periods. Updates will be provided to neighbors and others, as requested. HELIOS and its representatives discussed proposals for uses of Lot, including the single\u00ad family residence, with numerous individuals and groups island-wide in connection with the consultation process associated with the AIS, including with the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service, the Hanalei Community Association President and a Board Member who were given a presentation, the State of Hawaii Department of Land and Natural Resources (\"DLNR\"), and the State of Hawaii Historic Preservation Division. 8.1 PRE-ASSESSMENT AND AGENCY CONSULTATION A Pre-Assessment Letter was mailed on September 20, 2017 to a total of 13 interested parties, including government agencies, utilities, neighboring landowners and neighboring business such as: DLNR, Office of Conservation & Coastal Lands State of Hawaii Department of Transportation, Kauai District County of Kauai, Planning Department U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service The Hanalei-Ha'ena Community Association The Princeville Community Association Neighboring property owners 504629.1 28 Comments and responses were requested with a October 20, 2017 deadline. The Pre\u00ad Assessment Letter is included in Exhibit 11 to this EA. All responses will be incorporated following the conclusion of the 30-day comment period. SECTION 9 FINDINGS AND IMPACTS The availability of the draft EA will be announced in the State of Hawaii Office of Environmental Quality Control bi-monthly Environmental Notice publication during the mandatory 30-day public review period. In accordance with the provisions of HRS Chapter 343, the draft EA has concluded that the proposed project will not have significant adverse impacts on the environmental quality of the area. As such, it is respectfully suggested that a FONSI be issued for the proposed project. Therefore, an EIS is not required. A review of the 13 \"Significance Criteria\" used as a basis for the above determination is presented below. Involves an irrevocable commitment to loss or destruction of any natural or cultural resources. The proposed project will not use or destroy any natural resources on the proposed site; in fact, natural resources will be enhanced by the removal and control of invasive species and the preservation of hala trees and maintenance of mowed grass areas which provide forage for native birds. With regard to cultural resources, the AIS identified no historic properties on the proposed site; further, the proposed site is located well outside the buff er zone planned for the pre-contact historic property located on the Lot. Accordingly, the proposed project would not involve an irrevocable commitment to loss or the destruction of any natural or cultural resources. Curtails the range of beneficial uses of the environment. The proposed project will not curtail the range of beneficial uses of the environment. The project site is currently overgrown dense vegetation populated with invasive plant species. The dwelling represents 0.8% of the 14.109 acres of Conservation District land included in Lot, which (other than the project site) will remain undeveloped open space. Moreover, the proposed construction of one single-family home is a reasonable and beneficial use of the site, and the proposed control of invasive plant species will serve to actually enhance and protect the environment. Further, no long-term negative environmental impacts are anticipated as a result of the proposed project. Conflicts with the State's long-term environmental policies or goals and guidelines as expressed in HRS Chapter 343; and any revisions thereof and amendments thereto, court decisions, or executive orders. The proposed project does not conflict with the State's long-term environmental policies, goals, and guidelines. In fact, the removal of invasive species will enhance, conserve, and protect the natural resources of the Conservation District. The proposed project will not result in any adverse effects to the public health, safety and welfare. 29 504629.1 Substantially affects the community. The proposed project will not substantially impact the community, and will not negatively affect the economic or social welfare of the community. As set forth in sections 3, 4 and 5 of this document, the project will result in no significant negative impact on infrastructure, flora, fauna, cultural or historic properties, or visual or aesthetic resources. The project would, however, generate short-term employment and long-term real property tax revenues. Substantially affects public health. The proposed project will have no negative impact on public health. Involves substantial secondary impacts, such as population changes or effects on public facilities. The proposed project will not cause substantial secondary impacts. The development of a single-family residence in an area already characterized by similar residential development will not create additional pressures of a substantial nature. Population changes and effects on public facilities (such as roads, park use, potable water usage, electricity usage, etc.) will be minimal. Involves a substantial degradation of environmental quality. The proposed project will not result in a substantial degradation of environmental quality; in fact, the removal and control of invasive species will actually improve and enhance environmental quality. Further, as discussed in sections 3, 4 and 5 of this document, the proposed project will have no significant negative impact on the physical or social environment. All construction activities will be implemented using best management practices (\"BMPs \"). Is individually limited, but cumulatively has considerable effect on the environment, or involves a commitment for larger actions. Cumulatively, the proposed project will have no considerable negative effect on the environment, nor will the project create a commitment for larger actions. Regarding environmental effects, inasmuch as the project proposes to control invasive species and enhance potential forage and harborage habitat for native birds, the project will actually have a positive effect on the environment. Regarding a commitment for additional or larger actions, the project creates no such commitment inasmuch as the proposed action is a stand-alone proposal for the construction of one single-family residence; other than the proposed dwelling, no further residential development would be permitted in the Lot. Substantially affects a rare, threatened, or endangered species or its habitat. The proposed project will not substantially affect any rare, threatened, or endangered species, or its habitat. As discussed in sections 3.3 and 3.4 of this document, no known endangered species or their habitat exists at the project site. Measures to mitigate any potential harm to any native Hawaiian species will be employed during construction of the project. Further, the removal of invasive species and should create additional forage and harborage for native birds, some of which are threatened. Detrimentally affects air or water quality or ambient noise levels. No long-term negative impacts to air and water quality or ambient noise levels will result from the proposed project. A temporary increase in ambient noise levels could occur during construction of the dwelling. Nevertheless, best management practices (BMPs) will be employed where possible to mitigate 30 504629.1 any such impacts, as well as any short-term impacts on air quality from dust or similar construction effects. Refer to sections 3.2 and 3.5 of this document for a further discussion of the proposed project's impact on, respectively, water and air quality/noise. Affects or is likely to suffer damage by being located in an environmentally sensitive area, such as a flood plain, tsunami zone, beach, erosion-prone area, geologically hazardous land, estuary, freshwater, or coastal waters. The proposed project would not affect environmentally sensitive areas, such as a floodplain, tsunami zone, beach, erosion-prone area, geologically hazardous land, estuary, freshwater, or coastal waters, as the project site is not situated in any of these areas. Substantially affects scenic vistas and view planes identified in County or State plans or studies. The proposed project would not substantially affect scenic vistas and view planes identified in County or State plans or studies. The \"Historic, Scenic & Recreational Resources\" map appended to the North Shore Development Plan Update (1980) (\"North Shore Development Plan\") identifies numerous scenic view planes, many of which are along Kuhio Highway. The proposed dwelling will not impact view planes identified in the 'Historic, Scenic & Recreational Resources\" map of the North Shore Development Plan given that almost all such planes are makai-facing; any planes that face mauka are distant from the proposed project. The North Shore Planning District Heritage Resources Map (\"Heritage Resources Map\") appended to the Kauai General Plan (2000) (\"General Plan\") also identifies scenic roadway corridors along Kuhio Highway. The proposed project will be virtually invisible from the roadway view corridor identified in the Heritage Resources Map. Both documents express a concern for preserving scenic resources generally; as discussed in section 4.6 of this document, the proposed dwelling would not be visible from Hanalei Town and, to the extent the dwelling's roof might be visible from certain areas on the Hanalei Valley floor, the choice of building materials and surrounding large canopy tree plantings would result in the dwelling largely blending into its surrounding environment. A detailed discussion of the visual impacts of the proposed project, along with corresponding mitigation measures, is discussed in sections 4.4, 4.5 and 4.6 of this document. Requires substantial energy consumption. The proposed single-family residence will not consume substantial or undue amounts of energy. 31 504629.1 Dear Consulted Party: Subject: September 25, 2017 Pre-Assessment Consultation Regarding Single-Family Dwelling in the Conservation District, Tax Map Key (4) 5-4-004:032, Princeville, Hawaii You received our letter providing a copy of the draft Environmental Assessment describing the Helios Hanalei LLC plans for a single-family residence proposed for a 14.109 acre parcel in Princeville, Hawaii.

As represented, the project involves construction of a new single family residence. Based on the plot plan provided, the department is unable to make a determination without additional information. The department has previously issued a Special Management Area Minor Permit (SMA(M)-2015-33) for construction of a wall, gate and landscaping. It would be the department's preference that a completed SMA Assessment form and accompanying plans be submitted for review. At that point, the department will be able to determine whether an SMA Permit is applicable. Also, it would be prudent to schedule a pre\u00ad submittal meeting with a Planner prior to submittal of this project as additional applications may be required.

For reference the subject parcel is located entirely within the SLU Conservation District Resource Subzone; proposed land uses on this parcel are under the regulatory authority of this office. Staff has reviewed the submitted information regarding the proposed project and offers the following comments/concerns. For ease of review the comments will correspond to a section in the submitted material: Executive Summary Applicant stated that \"there is no observable erosion occurring\" -there has been significant erosion on the parcel that required rock fall mitigation. The applicant should bolster the discussion on potential drainage and erosion issues; The applicant states that the proposed project will have no significant impact on Historic or Cultural sites. As stated in the \"State of Hawaii Land Use Districts and Regulations Review\": The scenic significance of this area, in conjunction with Hanalei Valley, is of such grandeur that the conservation values clearly dominate. Staff would like a more detailed discussion on how the project will not substantially impact the scenic nature of Hanalei Valley and the overlook area. Discussion should focus on the vegetation surrounding the proposed project site, any viewplane \"windows\" being proposed, and the future REF: OCCL: AJR COR: KA-18-60 landscaping that could expose the proposed SFR to the entire Hanalei Valley area due to its location on a prominent site. Staff believes the subject parcel represents one of the most prominent landforms between Hanalei Bay and Hanalei Valley. Property Legal Background The applicant states \"The County of Kauai approved an SMA minor permit for the installation of a gate and rock wall at the entrance to the Lot on April 10, 2015. SMA(M)-2015-53 and CDUP KA-3729\". The County of Kauai did not approve of the Wall and Gate, that project application was approved by the Board of Land and Natural Resources, not the County of Kauai. We request that you clarify that the DLNR has regulatory authority over this parcel and all land use activities; Surrounding Built Environment Staff believes the prominent features in this area are the National Wildlife Refuge of Hanalei Valley and the existing and proposed Hanalei Valley overlook. Development in this area is primarily up hill and across the street from the subject parcel -well away from the subject parcel; The applicant states \"Directly across Kiihio Highway and surrounding the majority of the lot are the Hanalei Garden Farms condominiums and various homestead properties\", the property has no bordering development besides the Kuhio Highway. The property is bounded on two (2) sides by a National Wildlife Refuge, and no development is located directly adjacent to the proposed project site, this should be stated in the Environmental Assessment and CDUA. The Proposed Project Applicant provided only one alternative to the proposed structure, the OCCL requires that the applicant complete an Alternatives Analysis that discusses other potential designs for the proposed structure such as a smaller SFR, or an alternative location for the SFR on the 14-acre parcel. Please note that the alternative analysis should cover more than the \"preferred alternative\" and a \"no\u00ad action alternative\"; Applicant states \"Under HAR 13-5-24(c) and HAR \u00a713-5-41, one SFR may be constructed upon land in the Conservation District with the approval of the BLNR\". HAR \u00a713-5-24 indicates the required permits for identified land uses in the Resource subzone, please update that section. Additionally, please understand that HAR \u00a7 13-5 allows the landowner to apply for land uses in the Conservation District; permits and approvals are discretionary and therefore not automatic. Please change the language of this section to reflect that; Applicant states \"The Board Permit for a single family residence in the Resource Subzone does not require a public hearing\". Pursuant to HAR\u00a7 13-5-40(a)(4) Public hearings shall be held: On all applications determined by the chairperson that the scope of proposed use, or the public interest requires a public hearing on the application. Staff would like to inform you that this office has already received a number of inquiries concerning this proposed project, therefore the Chairperson may require a public hearing for this project if the application is accepted for processing. The applicant states: The proposed dwelling complies with the \"compatibility COR: KA-18-60 1. landscaping will screen much of the structure from the perspective of Kuhio highway, the dwelling will not be visible from Hanalei Town and, to the extent he dwelling would be visible from beaches, parks and roads within Hanalei Valley, the combination of foliage about the structure, setback from the slowed edges of the lot, single story construction, and choice of materials for the roof and exterior walls will obscure the dwelling such that it will not be readily discernable to the naked eye from its surroundings. Staff has concerns that the entire viewplane impact mitigation relies on the vegetation surrounding the parcel. Staff would like to see a discussion on how the residents of this are~ can be assured that the vegetation will be in place in perpetuity, and will not be removed in the future. If the vegetation is removed the structure and subsequent development will be glaringly visible from Hanalei Valley, Hanalei Bay, and Hanalei Town. Flora The applicant states: \"The proposed projects landscape plan would positively impact the project sites flora\", OCCL staff asks that the applicant clarify this statement, especially since the applicant is proposing to utilize non-native and potentially invasive tree for landscaping (i.e., Royal Poinciana). Pursuant to HAR \u00a7 13-5-23, L-2, Any replanting shall be appropriate to the site location and shall give preference to plant material that are endemic or indigenous to Hawaii. The introduction of invasive plant species is prohibited. The OCCL request that the applicant includes endemic or indigenous planting for landscaping purposes as required by HAR \u00a713-5; Based on the submitted information it appears the applicant will be conducting landscaping over a large portion of the project area. The removal of invasive species and the planting of vegetation is also planned; the CDUA should discuss these land uses in detail. Fauna The applicant stated: The Hawaiian Goose or Nene is common in nearby Hanalei National Wildlife Refuge and around the Princeville golf courses. The OCCL has directly observed Nene on open gassy areas at the project site, and surrounding development along Hanalei Valley Ridge. The applicant must discuss the possibility of Nene visiting open grassy areas of the project site, and the mitigation or protection strategies that will be put in place to protect this native Hawaiian species. Utilities and Roads and Traffic Conditions The applicant should discuss the \"flood gate\" (i.e., gate used to close road to Hanalei) located immediately adjacent to the property entrance. Staff has concerns that when flooding occurs in Hanalei valley which causes the roadway to close, the location of the entrance to the applicant's property and proposed development could be determinantal to public health and safety. The OCCL requests a discussion on any traffic impacts this project may have on Kiihi6 Highway. Applicant should also discuss traffic impacts associated with the vehicles turning into the parcel, or waiting to tum into the parcel. Visual and Aesthetic Resources: Impact on the Area The Applicant states: Extensive residential, community, and commercial development on Kilhio Highway exists to the northeast of the lot\". Staff believes the site is surrounded by a highway, a 3 REF: OCCL: AJR COR: KA-18-60 Wildlife Preserve, and an empty parcel -not extensive development. Staff considers this area to be undeveloped, and in some instances pristine and/or natural, please update this section to reflect that. Visual and Aesthetic resources: Impact on Immediately Adjacent Parcels The applicant states: There are no dwellings or businesses immediately across Kuhio Highway from the proposed site in any direction. Staff is confused as the applicant stated previously \"Kuhio Highway is not a pristine natural preserve; it is a developed residential and commercial area\". The OCCL requests the applicant clarifies the statements to be consistent throughout the entire EA and subsequent application. The applicant states: The dwelling will be partially visible, although mostly obscured by vegetation .from undeveloped parcels below Kuhio Highway in Hanalei Valley. The OCCL would like a discussion on the viewplane impacts this project will have on the citizens of Hawaii, the visitors to this area, and local residents of Hanalei Valley, Beach, Bay, and Town. Hawaii State Land Use Law OCCL staff requests a discussion on how this project \"ensures the sustainable use of the natural resources of the area\". Staff reminds the applicant that the natural resources the Conservation District protects in this area is the Scenic Significance. Section 9 Findings and Impacts The applicant discusses throughout the submitted material that the removal of invasive species will enhance the project sits conservation value. Staff would like to see a plan for the removal of the invasive species and how the removal of invasive species will not futher impact the viewplanes and Scenic Significance of this area. GENERAL COMMENTS ON PROPOSED CDUA Staff would like to reiterate the requirements set forth in Hawaii Administrative Rules (HAR) \u00a7 13- 5, Exhibit 4, with regards to the Maximum Developable Area (MDA). Please note that the MDA consists of all areas under roof, including, but not limited to: I5\\ 2nd, 3rd floors, decks, lanais, carports, pools, decking around the pool, sheds, storage buildings, and other development structures such as outdoor showers. Please note that the applicant should clearly outline the total MDA, and the MDA calculations. Additionally, the OCCL requests that all measurements, area calculations, dimensions, and descriptions of each proposed structure should be included. A Single Family Residence (SFR) is an identified land use to which you may apply for in the SLU Conservation District Resource Subzone, pursuant to HAR \u00a713-5-24, R-7 SINGLE FAMILY RESIDENCE (D-1) A single Family Residence that coriforms to design standards as outlined in this chapter. In order to apply for this land use, the applicant will be required to submit to this office a completed Conservation District Use Application (CDUA) for review and processing. Please note that the final decision to approve or deny this application will rest with the Board of Land and Natural Resources (BLNR). Landscaping, as described in the submitted letter, is considered an identified land use to which you may apply for in the SLU Conservation District Resource Subzone, pursuant to HAR grubbing, grading and tree removal), including chemical and mechanical control methods, in accordance with state and federal laws and regulations, in an area of or more than 10,000 square feet. Any replanting shall be appropriate to the site location and shall give preference to plant material that are endemic or indigenous to Hawaii. The introduction of invasive plant species is prohibited. In order to apply for this use the applicant will be required to submit to this office a completed CDUA for review and processing. Please note that the final decision to approve or deny this land use will rest with the BLNR. OCCL recognizes that each of the proposed land uses will require submittal of a board permit application (i.e., CDUA), however, we will accept one CDUA for the entire project. Please note that each CDUA section should differentiate between the proposed uses, and discussions should be very specific to the uses proposed. Additionally, the CDUA is a stand-alone document; each question should be answered fully and completely with specific information related to the uses described. If you have questions regarding this correspondence, please contact Alex J. Roy, M.Sc. of our Conservation and Coastal Lands staff at 808-587-0316 or via email at alex.j.roy@hawaii.gov Samue . Lemmo, Admimstrator Office of Conservation CC: Chairperson Kauai Board Member KDLO Kauai County Dept. of Planning Princeville Community Association Hanalei to Hii 'ena Community Association 5 OCT 2 3 2017 Hanalei to Ha'ena Community Association Post Office Box 1072 October 20, 2017 Jean Campbell Bays Lung Rose & Holma 700 Bishop Street, Suite 900 Honolulu, HI 96813 Hanalei, HI 96714 RE: HHCA Pre-Consultation Comments regarding in the Conservation District on TMK (4) 5-4-004:032 Dear Ms. Campbell, The Hanalei to Ha'ena Community Association (\"HHCA\") appreciates the opportunity for this Pre Assessment Consultation on the proposed Helios Project. The HHCA Board of Directors and the Zoning and Development Committee send the following comments and questions regarding the draft EA. HHCA Primary Comments and Concerns include: Adverse impacts to the view plain: the large multi pod hillside structure may negatively impact views from the Hanalei Valley area and the Hanalei Bay area (Hanalei River to the Waikoko area and lookout). The sprawl of the development will adversely impact the views from the Hanalei Valley area. Especially at night, the light that the property produces clearly will have significant impacts to endangered seabirds as well as negative view plan/ visual impacts. The design of the structures and high number of rooms in the proposed structure implies commercial or multifamily not residential use of property (proposal of 6-11 bedrooms is more like a Hotel). Conditions be imposed consistent with the Conservation District Rules, DEPARTMENT OF LAND AND NATURAL RESOURCES, Chapter 13-5 Hawaii Administrative Rules \u00a713-5-42, the single family residence shall not be used for rental or any other commercial purposes unless approved by the board. Transient rentals are prohibited, with the exception of wilderness camps approved by the board; Conditions imposed that the proposed \"SFR\" shall be prohibited from illegal activities such as a Transient Vacation Rental or a Bed and Breakfast as the parcel is not located in the Princeville Visitor Destination Area (VOA). Please provide the missing Exhibit documents so we can properly evaluate the project. Many of the documents mentioned in the DEA were not provided such as Exhibits 1-9. The pool and spa lack any construction information. The 5 foot setback is completely insufficient information. Impacts to two species of Hawaiian endangered seabirds; the Hawaiian Petrel (Pterodroma / 'ope'ape'a and endangered sub species of the hoary bat, endemic to the Hawaiian islands, were not adequately disclosed. Lack of Natural Hazard Assessment including descriptive information of erosion, flooding, slope, tsunami. Please disclose if there will be gas-line torches or other lighting on the perimeter of the property. Please provide a daytime and nighttime rendering of the entire proposed project for true perspective and opportunity to make informed comments. Please disclose if motion sensor lights or motion sensor sprayers will be used on the property. The structures should NOT BE VISIBLE from below and the portions of the parcel that abut KOhio Highway should remain wild to prevent the entire entrance into the Hanalei Bridge looking manicured, the area should remain natural. The ingress/egress to the property from KOhio Highway is potentially unsafe given the location of the current driveway. Westbound, the traffic comes over the rise at the top of the hill, potentially a blind spot for accidents with vehicles turning left in to the property. 2 Summary of Recommendations DEA -At this time, HHCA disagrees with the finding of no significant impacts within the Conservation District unless: The structure is redesigned as a single family residence, rather than 7-9 pods (individual structures stuck together) and the 6 to 11 bedrooms reduced to a normal family size. Setback information from sloped area is amended to an actual number not \"5 to 100 feet\" Pool is withdrawn from the proposal or the issue of where the pool wastewater will go is resolved and slope stability studies for the location of the proposed structures and pool are included. The following contains sections of the proposed draft EA and the HHCA Comments: EXECUTIVE SUMMARY The Executive Summary states that: \"the proposed dwelling has 4,342 sq. feet of living space, and a 622 sq. foot pool and spa\" HHCA Comments: The project should be limited to 1 structure, the design looks like 7-9 structures stuck together. It is unclear if the spa is yet another separate structure. The pool may impact the Hanalei River or KOhi6 Highway as there is no information in the document that talks about the pool wastewater, impacts or stability. The Executive Summary states that: \"Features of the proposed single-family dwelling re designed to minimize its visual impact from the neighboring area and the Hanalei Valley floor. \" HHCA Comments: There should be no visual impact along all portions of the entire Hana lei Bay area, from east to west, including the along KOhi6 Highway and the Hanalei Lookout, not only the Hanalei Valley and Town area. The Executive Summary also states that: \"The proposed dwelling is set back between 5 and I 00 feet from the sloped areas overlooking Hanalei Valley;\" 3 HHCA Comments: There should be a definitive setback. To properly gauge the Impact; the setback must be an exact number, with the proposed location defined, not approximate. It is unclear as written and designed with an insufficient setback. Utilities, Infrastructure and Air quality states that: \"Wastewater will be accommodated by an underground, self-contained, extended aeration wastewater treatment system consistent with State Health Department requirements. \" HHCA Comments: It is unclear where the pool water will be disposed of. Will it be accommodated by this proposed wastewater system or will it flow onto KOhio Highway or downstream? How will the pool water be prevented from ending up in the Hanalei River and ocean? Historic and Cultural Sites: \"The AIS and Final Preservation Plan explicitly contemplate the construction of Single-family dwellings on the project site.\" HHCA Comments: Conservation District only allows 1 house, this proposed design looks like many pods stuck together. The above statement the AIS and Final Preservation Plan contemplated the construction of dwellings on the project site is inaccurate and misleading, as Conservation District rules only allow 1 dwelling. SECTION 1 BACKGROUND 1.2 PROPERTY LEGAL BACKGROUND \"Historical uses of the Lot may have included pasture on the cleared portion traditional travel to mauka/makai lands by trail or road (which may have traversed the Lot). \" HHCA Comments: Any traditional mauka/makai access must be preserved in perpetuity and should be a condition of the permit. 1.3 SURROUNDING BUILT ENVIRONMENT \"Across Kfihii5 Highway from the Princeville Shopping Center, the scenic overlook of the Hanalei Valley provides public view\u00b7 of the Refuge and the valley. According to a draft 2002 Environmental Assessment of the proposed relocation and expansion of the overlook, 4 approximately 350 vehicles and four to ten tour busses were expected on the site daily (an estimated 900 visitors per day). \" HHCA Comments: This section is outdated. The 2002 EA is no longer the FWS's currently proposed project. The FWS will be preparing a new EA for a different proposal. So the above info cannot be referenced here. SECTION 2 PROPOSED PROJECT AND NO ACTION ALTERNATIVE 2.1 THE PROPOSED PROJECT The proposed project is located in the State Conservation District (Resource Subzone ).1 \u00a713-5-13 Resource (R) subzone. (a) The objective of this subzone is to ensure, with proper management, the sustainable use of the natural resources of the area. (b) The (R) subzone shall encompass: (]) Lands necessary for providing future parkland and lands presently used for national, state, county, or private parks; (2) Lands suitable for growing and harvesting of commercial timber or other forest products; (3) Lands suitable for outdoor recreational uses such as hunting, fishing, hiking, camping, and picnicking; ....... [HHCA underlined above] ( c) Identified land uses in the resource (R) subzone are restricted to those listed in section 13-5-24 HHCA Comments: Based on the above information the proposed project is not consistent with the above definition of a Resource Subzone. Throughout the document, the Alternatives presented for this proposed project failed to include uses more suited to the Resource Subzone including those alluded to in Section 6.2. The project as currently designed should be rejected by OCCL as it is inconsistent with the intent of the Subzone. The multi-unit structures, pool and spa are not compatible with the Resource Subzone; this proposal 1 The above lists items related to this project. 5 downplays the potential impacts from its multiple structures, 622 sq. foot pool and spa on the same land where slope stabilization was just needed. Three acres of this parcel needed slope stabilization to keep from impacting the state highway from falling rocks. The Draft EA failed to include slope stability studies despite the need for public funds to stabilize the parcel. In addition, there was no information about the stability of the proposed pool area or the potential impacts to slope stability and KOhio Highway from the drainage of the pool water or the impacts to the Hanalei River from the pool. Dwelling Exterior Finishes. Exhibit 1 was not included in the received document but referenced on page 7. Wastewater \"Wastewater from the dwelling will be addressed using an underground, self-contained, extended aeration wastewater treatment system which processes all wastewater\". HHCA Comments: Wastewater in this section only provides information for the \"dwelling\" and the wastewater from the proposed 622 sq. foot pool is not mentioned in this section (page 7). Does the proposed pool empty into the wastewater system? Where will the pool water go? Will the pool water drain towards KOhio Highway or the Hanalei River 150 feet away? Exhibit 3 is referred to but not included in the received document. 2.3 PROJECT LEGAL FRAMEWORK AND COMPLIANCE ANALYSIS Under HAR \u00a7\u00a7I3-5-24(c) and HAR 13-5-41, one single-family dwelling may be constructed upon land in the Conservation District with the approval of the BLNR. This section references the proposed dwelling compliance, but on page 8, item (iv) includes the dwelling unit, plus the proposed pool and spa .Is the spa a separate building? \"The proposed dwelling complies with the \"compatibility provisions\" of HAR \u00a713-5. In particular: \" (v) only one dwelling will be constructed; (vi) all building and grading code requirements will be followed; and (vii) there will be only one kitchen. 6 HHCA Comments: The disclosed structure looks like a multi-family or transient rental type rather than a SFR. Single family is defined in the HAR 13-5 as: \"Single family residence\" means a building or structure used or designated and intended to be used as a home or dwelling place for a family. The County of Kaua'i CZO defines hotel as: \"Hotel\" means any building containing six (6) or more rooms intended or designed to be used, or which are used, rented or hired out to be occupied for sleeping purposes by guests when the rooms are open to the occupancy by the general public on a commercial basis whether the establishment is called a hotel, resort hotel, inn, lodge or otherwise which rooms do not constitute dwelling units. HHCA Questions: In HAR 13-5-13, pool and spa are not listed as permitted uses within the Resource Subzone. In addition, what is the size of the proposed spa? What would the spa include: e.g., bathrooms, kitchen? SECTION 3 PHYSICAL ENVIRONMENTAL SETTING, IMPACTS AND PROPOSED MITIGATION 3.1 TOPOGRAPHY, SOILS, GEOLOFY, RAINFALL Existing Condition ... \"The Hanalei River, which meanders through the Hanalei Valley floor, is located approximately 150feet.from the southeastern corner of the Lot. The Hanalei River is the fourth largest stream in the State based upon the amount of water discharged (Stream Assessment Draft Report of 1990, State of Hawaii and National Park Service: 27) and, in 1998, was designated as one of seven American Heritage Rivers by Executive Order 13061.\" HHCA Comments & Questions: Will the proposed 622 sq. foot pool flow into the Hanalei River or KOhi6 Highway? Please explain where the pool wastewater will go. Topography, Soils and Geology .... \"The erosion hazard is considered slight to moderate\u00b7 on slopes of the inclination typical of the bluff portion of the Lot.\" 7 HHCA Comments: The slope map exhibit was not included, so it is not possible to make informed comments regarding the potential impacts in the slope areas. In the DEA it is stated that the setback is proposed to be between 5 and 100 feet from the slopped areas (page 1 ). A map exhibit is needed to make comments on this issue. The proposal needs to clearly identify the setback. Rainfall, Drainage and Natural Hazards .... \"The existing contours of the site will be maintained. Therefore, rainfall will generally be absorbed on the site and storm water in extreme conditions will flow direction discharging to Kuhio Highway, as under the existing circumstances. Slope mitigation work covering approximately 3 acres of the Lot within the drainage area was done by the State of Hawaii pursuant to a Right of Entry Agreement dated August 16, 2004 recorded against the Lot as Document No. 200 -085546. The proposed project will not increase the risk of natural hazards (i.e., landslides) due to the very limited alteration of site drainage, location of the dwelling on the level portion of the Lot and the existing slope stabilization improvements which will remain in place. \" HHCA Comments & Questions: In what location and proximity to the proposed building site was the slope stabilization \"improvements\" done? This parcel was eroding into the public highway necessitating the slope stabilization, what studies have been done to show the pool and or structures will not exacerbate the problems? What is the direction of the pool drainage? How will the proposed pool affect storm discharge onto KOhio Highway? See pages 9 & 10. Potential Impacts and Mitigation Proposed Project \"The proposed project will have no significant direct or indirect impact on the Hanalei River, the adjacent valley wetlands or the coastal waters (including Hanalei Bay).\" HHCA Comments: Absent any details on the pool wastewater, we disagree with this statement and have no way to evaluate the impacts of the pool wastewater on Hana lei Valley wetlands, Hanalei River or \"coastal waters (including Hanalei Bay).\" Any drainage of pool water, whether chlorinated or not, will impact the environment, destabilize the hillside and pollute the Hanalei River. 8 3.4 FAUNA ... \"Two newelli) -regularly fly over were not observed during the survey\" HHCA Comments: The proposed project is located on a prominent point of land that protrudes into the Hanalei watershed flyway commonly used by two species of Hawaiian endangered seabirds; the Hawaiian Petrel (Pterodroma newelli) . Both of these native birds are ground nesting and their limited habitat includes the upper watershed of Hanalei. These seabirds fly to and from their breeding colonies only at night. Human light pollution can confuse this behavior, particularly in fledglings during the very first journey from the colony to the sea. These fledglings become disoriented by bright lights and fly into buildings or become exhausted and land on the ground in a phenomenon known as 'fall-out'. The specific location of this project presents a direct danger to these protected native birds from both exterior and interior lights as well as the difficulty in rescuing any downed birds because of the adjacent terrain. Once on the ground, these exhausted and confused birds cannot fly again and either die from exposure and starvation or are eaten by feral cats and dogs. The proposed project is also located in the known habitat range of the Hawaii State Mammal, the Hawaiian Hoary bat, Lasirus cinereus semotus / 'ope'ape'a and endangered sub species of the hoary bat and endemic to the Hawaiian islands. To avoid impacts of the protected Hawaiian Hoary bat, any cutting of trees above fifteen feet during breeding and pupping season (June 1 through September 15) should be avoided and any construction should be limited to daytime only to avoid disturbance. Monitoring of bat activity should be conducted prior to and during any construction on this site. 3.6 UTILITIES AND ROADS and 4.2 TRAFFIC CONDITIONS Sections 3.6 and 4.2 state: 9 \"The addition of the residence should have no material impact on wear of or traffic on Kuhio Highway. \" HHCA Comments: The ingress/egress to the property from KOhi6 Highway is potentially dangerous given the location of the current driveway. Westbound, the traffic comes over the rise at the top of the hill, potentially a blind spot for accidents with vehicles turning left in to the property. The proposed residence may have an impact on traffic in the area as access to the parcel would entail crossing KOhi6 Highway. According to one of the attached maps the number of bedrooms could be from 6 to 11. With this high number of those occupying the so-called residence, there could be a traffic impact on the historic roadway. In order to not dramatically increase the traffic in and out of the parcel on this portion of the highway, there should be a condition to restrict construction workers vehicles from directly accessing the parcel, with a shuttle for workers utilized during the construction timeline. 4.3 HISTORIC AND CULTURAL PROPERTIES ... \"An cultural impact assessment was also conducted for this parcel. \" HHCA Comments: The cultural impact assessment Exhibit 9 was not included in the document, thus HHCA has no way to evaluate the assessment. 4.4 VISUAL AND AESTHETIC RESOURCES: IMPACT ON THE AREA ... \"Given the proximity to the busy Princeville Shopping Center, Hanalei Fire and Police Station and multiple other residences, this portion of Kuhio Highway is not a pristine, natural preserve; it is a developed residential and commercial area. \" HHCA Comments: This section references in detail the development on the opposite side of the historic KOhi6 Highway, but fails to disclose and document the complete lack of any development on the side of the highway of the proposed project. 10 4.6 VISUAL AND AESTHETIC RESOURCES: IMPACT ON VIEWS FROM THE HANALEIVALLEYFLOOR ... \"By limiting the dwelling to one story (with a maximum height of 18 feet 1.5 inches) and by setting back the structure 5 to 100 feet from the sloped portion of the Lot, the dwelling's visibility from these locations on the valley floor is substantially mitigated if not eliminated. \" HHCA Comments: With the setback proposed at \"5 -100 feet\" it is impossible to know what the impacts will be. The proposed project needs to disclose and provide a map that identifies the definitive setback distance. For purposes of comparison, it should be noted that there are numerous dwellings along Hanalei Plantation Road ... new hotel .. .former Club Med site . ... \"There is further development planned at the northernmost end of the Hanalei Valley rim overlooking Hanalei Bay including more than 30 dwellings and a new hotel proposed to be constructed on the former Club Med site. \" HHCA Comments: This referenced project has been withdrawn and it is inaccurate to cite this and should be removed from the DEA. \"At night, it is possible the proposed dwelling's lights could be seen from parts of the Hanalei Valley floor (note, hundreds of lights in Hanalei are visible from the eastern valley rim). This impact would be mitigated by the surrounding vegetation, the residence's setback within the Lot, compliance with down lighting requirements for all exterior lights and the Landscape Plan's use of foliage.\" HHCA Comments: See comments in 3.4 Fauna above. SECTION 5 CUMULATIVE IMPACTS \"Cumulative impacts are two or more individual effect's which, when considered together, compound or increase the overall impact. The cumulative impacts of implementing the proposed project along with past and reasonably foreseeable future projects on the Lot are assessed based upon current available information. 11 There are no construction projects planned for the Lot, other than the proposed single\u00ad family dwelling project. Accordingly, there are no cumulative impacts to be considered. \" HHCA Comments: This statement conflicts with Section 6.2 and sounds like the project is being segmented. Section 6.2 states: \"HELJOS's long-term plans for the remaining acreage in Lot includes various remedial efforts, such as preservation of specified areas for (i) hiking, (ii) planting of native foliage, and (iii) recreational space. These improvements would be in fitrtherance of the specific objectives of HAR \u00a713-5-13(b)(l) and (b)( 3).\" 6.1 HA WAl'I STATE PLANNNG ACT ... \"The County of Kaua 'i General Plan (2000) recognizes the Princeville community as \"the only North Shore community that provides the full range of urban-level services, including wastewater treatment [see footnote 2 in document].The proposed project would be developed within close proximity to urban services of the Princeville area, including potable water and electric service, and would therefore be consistent with the policy of encouraging urban development within the meaning of HRS 226-13 (b )(7)[also see footnote 3].\" HHCA Comments: This parcel is not \"urban\" as it is in the Conservation District. It also is not part of the Princeville area and it is not served by the Princeville wastewater/ sewer system, nor its water or electric service, it is outside of the Princeville community and not consistent with HRS 226-13(b)(7). 6.2 HA WAl'I STATE LAND USE LAW ... \" HELJOS's long-term plans for the remaining acreage in Lot includes various remedial efforts, such as preservation of specified areas for (i) hiking, (ii) planting of native foliage, and (iii) recreational space. These improvements would be in furtherance of the specific objectives of HAR \u00a713-5-13(b)(l) and (b)( 3).\" HHCA Comments: These proposals should be included and disclosed in this DEA. They should also be used as a viable Alternative rather than the \"nothing\" sited as alternatives throughout the document, but most importantly development should not be allowed to be segmented. 12 ... \" The proposed project will not impact any view planes specifically identified in the North Shore Plan including views .from the Kuhio Highway corridor, view identified in the \"Historic, Scenic & Recreational Resources\" map (appended to the North Shore Plan) and views identified in the North Shore Special Planning Area Report, 1972. Additionally, as discussed in sections 4. 4, 4. 5 and 4. 6 of this document, the proposed project will have no significant adverse impact on views of the Hanalei Valley rim.\" HHCA Comments: The potential construction of the \"living areas\" of 4342 sq. ft., pool and spa could have a significant adverse impact on the views from the Hanalei Valley area. The project feels like \"the rich looking down on the peons\". The structures should NOT BE VISIBLE from below. HHCA believes the sprawl of the development will adversely impact the views from Hanalei Valley area. Especially in the night, the light that the property produces clearly will have significant impact on the views and night sky. SECTION 7 PERMITS AND APPROVALS ... \" County Department of Public Works (\"DPW'') permit to bring electric conduit .from KIUC line across Kuhio Highway; and\" ... HHCA Comments: There has been no disclosure in the DEA about electric lines, will the electric lines go overhead and if so, what impact will the new electric lines have on the Shearwater flyway? SECTION 9 FINDINGS AND IMPACTS \"Substantially affects a rare, threatened, or endangered species or its habitat. The proposed project will not substantially affect any rare, threatened, or endangered species, or its habitat. As discussed in sections 3 .3 and 3 .4 of this document, no known endangered species or their habitat exists at the project site. Measures to mitigate any potential harm to any native Hawaiian species will be employed during construction of the project.\" HHCA Comments: We disagree with this finding. The proposed project is located on a prominent point of land that protrudes into the Hanalei watershed flyway commonly used by two species of Hawaiian endangered seabirds; the 13 Hawaiian Petrel (Pterodroma likely to suffer damage ... The proposed project would not affect environmentally sensitive areas, such as a floodplain, tsunami zone, beach, erosion-prone area, geologically hazardous land, estuary, freshwater, or coastal waters, as the project site is not situated in any of these areas. \" HHCA Comments: We disagree with this finding as the pool drainage has not been disclosed and likely will affect freshwater and/or coastal waters. \"Substantially affects scenic vistas and view planes identified in County or State plans or studies. The proposed project would not substantially affect scenic vistas and view planes identified in County or State plans or studies. \" HHCA Comments: We disagree with this finding as the 5-foot setback would be totally unsuitable for the unspoiled area and likely would impact public views and scenic vistas. The ingress/egress to the property from KOhi6 Highway is potentially dangerous given the location of the current driveway. Westbound, the traffic comes over the rise at the top of the hill, potentially a blind spot for accidents with vehicles turning left in to the property. t)~~r'* Carl Imparato HHCA President Barbara Robeson HHCA Zoning & Development Committee cc: Mr. Samuel J.
