To Request an Action Plan to Address Vaccine Toxicity and Autism [Click Here](requestactionplan.asp) Vaccine Toxicity and Autism This Study Reveals Children are Being Vaccinated With Toxic Levels of Aluminium Causing Neurological Damage and Autism The Alternative Perspective A recent study conducted by Canadian scientists Professor Christopher Shaw and Dr. Lucija Tomljenovic revealed that the more vaccines that children receive containing the adjuvant aluminum, the greater their chance is of developing autism, autoimmune diseases and neurological problems in the future. In 2013, in their paper, published by Springer Science+Business Media, titled Aluminum in the Central Nervous System: Toxicity in Humans and Animals, Vaccine Adjuvants, and Autoimmunity, they revealed that during a 17-year period, the rates of autism had increased significantly in countries that had the most vaccinations containing the adjuvant aluminum. A Highly Significant Correlation A Highly Significant Correlation The researchers compared the number of vaccines recommend by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) during the period from 1991 - 2008 and the changes in the autism rates during the same period. They wrote: \"The data sets, graphed against each other, show a pronounced and statistically highly significant correlation between the number vaccines with aluminum and the changes in autism rates. Further data showed that a significant correlation exists between the amounts of aluminum given to preschool children and the current rates of autism in seven Western countries. Those countries with the highest level of aluminum-adjuvanted vaccines had the highest autism rates.\" [1] (own emphasis) They revealed that: \"The observed correlation between the number of aluminum-adjuvanted vaccines and ASD was further tested using Hill's criteria and met eight of nine of these indicating that vaccines containing aluminum are highly likely to be at least partially causal for autism.\" For those who are not familiar with 'Hill's criteria,' it is a technique used to determine a causal link between a specific factor and a disease. For example, does excess smoking cause lung cancer? Scientists seeking 'to establish a valid causal connection between a potential disease agent' now frequently use the technique, which was first developed by British medical statistician Austin Bradford Hill. [2] Professor Shaw and Dr. Tomljenovic continued their paper by adding that: \"There are other links between aluminum exposure/toxicity and ASD. These include the following: A pilot study showed higher than normal aluminum levels in the hair, blood and/or urine of autistic children; children are regularly exposed to higher levels of aluminum in vaccines per body weight than adults; practically, nothing is known about the pharmacokinetics and toxicodynamics of aluminum in vaccines in children; and aluminum in vaccines has been linked to serious neurological impairments, chronic fatigue and autoimmunity.\" If Professor Shaw and Dr. Tomljenovic are correct, then their results are extremely worrying, especially as autism is not the only condition to which their paper linked the adjuvant aluminum. In fact, their paper also linked aluminum to the rise in the incidence of [Alzheimer's](alzheimersdisease.asp), Gulf War syndrome and a relatively new syndrome, ASIA (autoimmune/inflammatory syndrome induced by adjuvants) that was identified by scientists last year. Toxic Aluminum Levels In Vaccines Toxic Aluminum Levels in Vaccines In 2012, a paper written by Stephanie Seneff, Robert M. Davidson and Jingjing Liu, titled Empirical Data Confirm Autism Symptoms Related to Aluminum and Acetaminophen Exposure, also confirmed that exposure to a large number of vaccinations containing the adjuvant aluminum at a young age was the most likely cause for the increase in autism and other adverse reactions to vaccines. They wrote: \"In this paper, we have presented some analyses of the VAERS database which strongly suggest that the aluminum in vaccines is toxic to vulnerable children. While we have not shown that aluminum is directly causative in autism, the compelling evidence available from the literature on the toxicity of aluminum, combined with the evidence we present for severe adverse reactions occurring much more frequently following administration of aluminum-containing vaccines as compared to non-aluminum containing vaccines, suggests that neuronal damage due to aluminum penetration into the nervous system may be a significant factor in autism. The fact that mentions of autism rose steadily concomitant with significant increases in the aluminum burden in vaccines, is highly suggestive.\" [3] This is particularly bad news to any parent considering having their children vaccinated, as a growing number of the childhood vaccinations now contain the adjuvant aluminum as an ingredient. This was explained in depth by pediatrician Robert Sears, in his excellent article published in the magazine Mothering in 2008. Dr. Sears is another professional exceptionally worried about the effects of aluminum on children's health. In an article warning mothers about the dangers of vaccinations containing the adjuvant, titled Is Aluminum The New Thimerosal? Dr. Sears explained that aluminum is added to vaccinations to help them work more efficiently. He stated that although this would not normally be a problem because aluminum is a naturally occurring element found everywhere in our environment, including our food, water, air and soil, he had become worried about the effects that aluminum was having on children's health. He began to wonder if anyone had ever actually tested the safe level of injected aluminum. During his research, he came across a number of extremely worrying documents. However, few were as worrying as the one written by the American Society for Parenteral and Enteral Nutrition (ASPEN). Describing the document in depth, Sears wrote: \"The source of the daily limit of 4 to 5 mcg of aluminum per kilogram of body weight quoted by the ASPEN statement seems to be a study that compared the neurologic development of about 100 premature babies who were fed a standard IV solution that contained aluminum, with the development of 100 premature babies who were fed the same solution with almost all aluminum filtered out. The study was prompted by a number of established facts: that injected aluminum can build up to toxic levels in the bloodstream, bones, and brain; that preemies have decreased kidney function and thus a higher risk of toxicity; that an autopsy performed on one preemie whose sudden death was otherwise unexplained revealed high aluminum concentrations in the brain; and that aluminum toxicity can cause progressive dementia.\" He continued by giving some extremely alarming facts, of which few parents are aware: \"However, none of these documents or studies mentions vaccines; they look only at IV solutions and injectable medications. Nor does the FDA require labels on vaccines warning about the dangers of aluminum toxicity, although such labels are required for all other injectable medications. All of these studies and label warnings seem to apply mainly to premature babies and kidney patients. What about larger, full-term babies with healthy kidneys?\" He explained: \"However, these documents don't tell us what the maximum safe dose would be for a healthy baby or child, and I can't find such information anywhere. This is probably why the ASPEN group suggests, and the FDA requires, that all that all injectable solutions be limited to 25 mcg; we at least know that that level is safe.\" If this is so, then why do the recommended childhood vaccinations include far above the recommend amounts? According to Dr. Sears, the levels of aluminum included in childhood vaccinations are as follows: - DTaP (diphtheria, tetanus, and pertussis): 170-625 mcg, depending on manufacturer - Hepatitis A: 250 mcg - Hepatitis B: 250 mcg - Pneumococcus: 125 mcg (emphasis added) You do not have to be medically qualified to understand that these levels far exceed the safe levels recommended by ASPEN, especially when you consider that a newborn baby is vaccinated with the hepatitis B vaccine, containing 250 mcg of aluminum, at birth! In fact, according to Dr. Sears, the FDA stated that: \"Although aluminum toxicity is not commonly detected clinically, it can be serious in selected patient populations, such as neonates (newborns), and may be more common than is recognized.\" [4] (emphasis added) If this is true, then why are all newborn infants, including those born prematurely, vaccinated at birth with the vaccine against hepatitis B, which is loaded with more than the recommend safe levels of aluminum? Additional Concerns and The Medical Perspective Additional Concerns for Preemies It is a recognized fact that many babies are born prematurely. A baby can now survive outside of their mother's womb as young as 24 weeks gestation. This means that many extremely premature babies are being vaccinated with massive amounts of aluminum on the day they are born. If this is not bad enough, at the tender age of eight weeks, in line with the CDC recommended childhood vaccination schedules, these tiny, immature babies are vaccinated with as many as nine vaccinations in one day. [5] For a baby born at 24 weeks, this means that they are still playing a game of catch-up when they are vaccinated because they are \"minus eight weeks\" and not \"plus eight weeks\" at the time of vaccination. In fact, many of them will be taken out of their incubator to be legally vaccinated by medical professionals with vaccinations that could potentially kill them! The Medical Perspective The Medical Perspective The Medical Community has gone on record stating that all research indicates no correlation with vaccinations, the number of vaccination, the adjuvants in vaccines and other toxic chemicals found in vaccines have nothing to do with neurological diseases including Autism. [Medicines Two Choices](MedicinesTwoChoices.asp) for You Dr. Huntoon's Conclusion and Alternative Treatment Options Conclusion Aluminum, as these papers have demonstrated, is extremely toxic, especially when children are repeatedly vaccinated with vaccines containing aluminum over the recommended limits. The FDA and ASPEN recommend 25 mcg to be a safe limit and yet, as Dr. Sears has shown in his article, many of the childhood vaccinations contain aluminum far in excess of this amount. The papers that I have studied make it abundantly clear that the more vaccines that children receive containing aluminum, the greater chance they have of developing [autism](autism.asp), [autoimmune diseases](autoimmunedisease2.asp), [Alzheimer's disease](alzheimersdisease.asp) and neurological deficits in the future. As parents, it is our duty to protect our children at all cost, and yet how many of us know what the recommended vaccinations contain? Parents need to research more thoroughly the ingredients included in the vaccinations with which they are planning to have their child vaccinated and the possible effects that these ingredients may have on their child's health. Autism, for the majority of children, is for life and it can affect every aspect of their development. Surely, we owe it to our children to at least be fully aware of the possible dangers of vaccinations, before subjecting our children to as many as 39 vaccines between the ages of zero to six which are known to be loaded with aluminum, mercury, formaldehyde and many other potentially lethal ingredients. Please read the papers referenced below before vaccinating your child. [Medicines Two Choices](MedicinesTwoChoices.asp) for You Your Solution Strongly consider doing all the research you can. Go to the National Vaccine Information Center at [www.NVIC.org ](https://www.nvic.org) and ask questions, do some reading, watch some videos and become fully informed before allowing your newborn child to be vaccinated. And know this: You can never un-vaccinate them if something bad were to happen once vaccinated. Please consider this when making your child's health decision for them. Working with a [Holistic Chiropractor](WhatIsAHolisticChiropractor.asp) can help you minimize the effects of whatever choice you make for the health of your child. Boosting your child's immune system is the best place to start. Your Holistic Chiropractor can teach you how to do that naturally.

His perspective is to never inject any medication that will bypass the normal entry into the body WITHOUT knowing the consequences. And you will never know the consequences BEFORE having the vaccine administered. In fact, you may not know the harmful consequences until they begin school. Don't let this be your child. Do Your Research! Prevention Prevention There is no vaccine to protect against Alzheimer's, Autism, Autoimmune Disease. You can help protect your child by considering the consequences of injecting these substances when you HAVE NO IDEA WHAT THE EFFECT IS GOING TO BE BEFORE RECEIVING THE VACCINE! Vaccines are still in the research and development stage. Do Your Research and don't go along with all the others who are not as diligent in researching the latest information. Go "}
