[Research](https://www.hsph.harvard.edu/nutritionsource/what-should-you-eat/vegetables-and-fruits/) indicates that a diet filled with fruits and vegetables can help reduce risk of disease, boost immunity, and help with weight management. However, according to the [CDC](https://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/volumes/71/wr/mm7101a1.htm), only around 1 in 10 adults are actually getting enough fruits and vegetables in their diet. What Juice Cleanses Do While juice cleanses can have health benefits, it's important to be realistic about what a 3-day juice cleanse can and cannot achieve. \"You probably have come across a lot of misinformation about cleanses online. A 3-day juice cleanse is not a quick weight-loss tool, and it won't reverse years of damage. But that certainly doesn't mean that there aren't any benefits,\" says Dr. Aimee Wrubel, physician and natural wellness expert at [Vitamix](https://www.anrdoezrs.net/click-100589611-15364950). Wrubel explains that a cleanse can provide the opportunity to allow your body to rest and reset, so you can make better choices for healthier eating habits featuring nutrient dense foods moving forward. \"The cleanse benefits your body, but it ultimately should be the jumping off point for an improved relationship with food and healthy choices,\" she says. While many juice cleanses remove natural fiber from fruits, and veggies, leaving only the juice behind, using a blender such as a Vitamix for a juice cleanse can allow you to enjoy the benefits of the whole food. \"At Vitamix, we know that whole foods are important and healthy for our bodies. That's why we create powerful blenders that are capable of making whole food juices that include the healthy fiber, reduce waste and mess, and get you more out of your food,\" explains Wrubel. She shares that blending the raw foods releases their hidden nutrients and fresh juice allows you to pack multiple servings of fruits and veggies into your glass when juice cleansing.

What should people know before they start a juice cleanse? Before embarking on a juice cleanse, as with any major diet change, be sure to review your goals and check with your doctor. What should you do to prepare for your juice cleanse? Plan your 3-day juice cleanse ahead of time, then shop and meal prep for your juice recipe menu before you start. You can keep all your ingredients prepped for each juicing recipe in the fridge (minus any frozen ingredients) in a silicone bag or a mason jar, so you just have to drop them into the Vitamix to whip it up fresh. That way you get the most out of your food as it's blended fresh just before you drink it. How many juices should you drink each day and should you drink water as well? Hydration is always important. Because whole food juices are made with fruits and veggies, there tends to be a high water content of the drinks anyway. However, you can definitely still drink water throughout the day during a cleanse\u2014you just may not feel as thirsty. Keep an eye on the color of your urine to guide you. If it's darker than a pale yellow, grab another glass of water to hydrate. What To Do and What Not To Do During a Juice Cleanse Do you have any tips for dos and don'ts to get the most out of a juice cleanse? Be sure to use this time to let your body rest and recover. Do: Go for walks and practice gentle exercise like yoga. But don't: Do vigorous exercise in attempts to burn a bunch of extra calories. Do: Take warm baths, meditate, practice gratitude, and snuggle up with a favorite book. This is not about punishing yourself or your body; it's about celebrating it! Do: Nourish your body from within. It's important that we realize our health comes from not only what we put into our bodies, but what we refrain from eating, too. That's why a cleanse can be so helpful, to help break us of the addiction to foods that aren't health promoting, and filling our body up with complete nutrition. Dr. Wrubel's tips and tricks when making your juices at home Would you prefer a thicker or thinner juice? For a thicker smoothie-like texture: Add more fruits or vegetables For a thinner juice-like texture: Add a little water or high water-content fruit (like grapes or oranges) before blending. Need it sweeter? Try adding some pineapple, apple, or a few dates to sweeten your drink up, while still keeping it whole-food oriented. Be mindful when eating the day after a cleanse. It's a shock to your system if the first meal after your cleanse is a milkshake and cheeseburger. Reach for whole fruits and veggies, plus healthy lean protein sources (or even try the soup recipes below.) How to Juice Cleanse at Home Below, Dr. Wrubel shares how to do a 3-day juice cleanse at home using the [Vitamix blender](https://www.anrdoezrs.net/click-100589611-15364950) [ blender](https://www.vitamix.com/us/en_us/shop/smart-system-blenders) with three juice recipes for each day. (The recipes will make more than one serving each, so they should be very satisfying.) She's also included soup recipes for if you find yourself wanting a little something extra. \"The great thing about the Vitamix blender is that it is so versatile without needing a collection of attachments or accessories. Because we're blending whole produce without extracting the fiber, we're keeping all the food's natural health benefits intact,\" says Dr. Wrubel. Tip: If you would prefer to remove the fiber instead, strain the drinks through a cheesecloth or filtration bag. These recipes for a three day juice diet experience include raw fruit ingredients, green juice options, and smoothies.

Vitamix Juice Cleanse Ingredient Benefits: You'll see some recurring raw fruit and vegetable juice ingredients in the juice recipes for this 3 day cleanse, and there's a good reason why. Certain fruits and vegetables can provide health benefits including providing healthy antioxidants, essential vitamins and minerals, and help give you energy. Dr. Wrubel tell us what to know about the ingredients featured in this juice cleanse: Pineapple: A sweet fruit that comes pre-packed with digestive enzymes. Pineapple\u2014and in particular the tough core\u2014is home to Bromelain, which helps us to break down food, improving digestion and promoting gut health. Carrots: You'll go through much fewer carrots making whole fruit juices in the Vitamix than in a regular juicer. But you'll retain their beneficial fiber. Carrots are also famous for their beta-carotene content, a nutrient that turns into Vitamin A in the body and is essential for our eye health. Citrus (Lemon/Lime/Orange): Besides adding a refreshing taste, citrus fruits are loaded with Vitamin C that boost our immune system and help protect us from getting sick. Just be sure that you maintain the white pith under the peel! Examples include lemon juice and orange juice. Ginger: We love the flavor ginger adds to juices, but we love the digestion support it offers even more. Turmeric: This colorful root is well known for anti inflammatory properties and has been used for hundreds of years. Beets: This dark red beauty packs a punch of antioxidants like none-other. You'll notice just a small amount of these nutrition heroes turns the juice a beautiful red color. Other Popular Juice Recipe Ingredients Other juice cleanse ingredients popular for a three day juice cleanse include leafy greens like spinach and kale, refreshing ingredients cucumber and celery, cayenne pepper for spice, and aloe vera. Some juice cleanses also feature creamy options that may include matcha or cacao with almond milk or cashew milk for a healthy smoothie-like beverage.
