Stating it to have been a good wig, since she had not noticed it, Walker speculates that it must be human hair, narrowing down their search as there are only three human hair wig shops in [New York City](/wiki/New_York_City).

Jones yells at him to get off and he is startled, causing him to lose his balance and slip. Jones runs and catches him, pulling him up into the room just as his parents arrive.

Davos is menacing towards Wing, showing himself to still be angry at her [Hand](/wiki/Hand)allegiance, and Wing tries to break the tension, saying they should all admit they are hiding their true intentions, and they need to get everything off their collective chests, asking them to air their grievances, since both people matter greatly to Rand. Davos refuses and walks off to the bathroom, leaving Joy Meachum to talk.

Bethany says she will call [Carlos](/wiki/Carlos_(NA_Meeting))to see if he can take over as Meachum's sponsor, since it is wrong of her to be sleeping with her sponsee.

Before they can check it, they are confronted by a small group of [Yangsi Gonshi](/wiki/Yangsi_Gonshi), led by a man called [Liu](/wiki/Liu), who threatens them and tells them to leave. [Sherry Yang](/wiki/Sherry_Yang)arrives and dismisses Liu, saying they are here on her invite.

She says there is no other option, and Wing asks if this is coming from her husband, [Hai-Qing Yang](/wiki/Hai-Qing_Yang). Sherry insists that she speaks for him in his absence, and looks uncomfortable, causing Wing to realize that him being in [Hong Kong](/wiki/Hong_Kong)was a lie. Yang admits this, saying he has suffered a stroke and that prognosis is negative. Rand is suspicious of the stroke's timing, and Wing asks him to step out briefly, feeling he is being too headstrong. Wing talks to Sherry Yang about the fact that if they do not stop the Triad War, there will be many Yangsi Gonshi deaths. Meanwhile, Rand investigates the room from which they heard the beeping, where he finds Hai-Qing. Checking his shoulder, he recognizes the [Devil's Claw](/wiki/Devil%27s_Claw)attack. Hai-Qing awakens and Rand asks him if a man called Davos did this to him. Hai-Qing manages to mutter \"Hancock 2-1-2\", before his heartbeat becomes erratic. A nurse reenters the room with Sherry and Wing, and Sherry asks them to leave. He tries to ask her what Hai-Qing's words mean, but Liu comes into the room and forces them out.

She states that Chang is now in hospital with broken bones, attacked by \"some guy with a glowing fist\". Knight tells Rand that the faction arriving at the parley were cops, likely a follow team trying to get evidence to take down each Triad's leadership, and the couple messed it up. She asks them to take a step back, but Rand says that something bigger is at play with Davos, with Wing explaining about the induced stroke. Asking Knight what she might know about \"Hancock 2-1-2\", she replies that [Hancock Transport](/wiki/Hancock_Transport)is a big maritime shipping company, and they realize that Yang likely cancelled a deal with Davos over a shipment to the docks because of the parley. Rand wants to go to the docks, but Knight insists that he leave it to the police, and Wing agrees. Stating that he will let it go, he steps outside.

However, she admits she could not let everything in the neighborhood slide, so has been trying to help people where she can. She goes to check on Rand, and finds him gone.

Knight goes to check the corpse, and Wing tells Rand she does not understand why he keeps running in headfirst without stopping to think, pointing out he put a police officer in the hospital the night before because of it. Rand says he thought, because of what she went through with [Bakuto](/wiki/Bakuto), that she would understand how difficult it can be finding out someone you have known for most of your life is capable of such horrible things, and she reluctantly tells him he should go.

She accepts this, noting that she is not, however, ready to forgive him. He says that while Murdock has recently been a poor friend, they need to be better and not bail on him like everyone else in his life has.

Bethany tells him he has to believe in himself and his own ability to improve, but Meachum forlornly admits that he does not even like himself. She bids him farewell, telling him she does have faith in him.

He and Page agree they need to take Evans to the [New York Bulletin](/wiki/New_York_Bulletin)for a submissible confession. Evans, however, explains that if he talks, [Wilson Fisk](/wiki/Wilson_Fisk)will kill his son. Page, however, threatens to print the story regardless, saying he can either talk and then be given the chance to get away, or go back to prison and have lies printed in the paper, feeling that they have to make him talk for the sake of the innocent lives that will be lost if Fisk remains out of prison.

[Maggie Grace](/wiki/Maggie_Grace)says it is nice to see him not heading out to beat people up, and Murdock jokes that he might just be fighting with more style. Grace is delighted to hear him being slightly more light-hearted and jovial, and mentions the \"blonde\" who visited her earlier, whom Murdock realizes is Page. Calling her his friend, Grace is happy to hear him talk about having friends again. He tells her what he is heading out to do, to clear his name, and she points out that he is clearing the name of Matt Murdock, so seems to be reclaiming that name somewhat despite his previous assertions.

He then reveals to Hunter what the plan is: the capsule is a cryogenic chamber, and he will sleep in freeze for 74 years, to wake up biologically still young in 2091.

Before her mother leaves, Ruby suddenly asks her if she is a \"good guy\". Hale asks her why she is questioning this, and Ruby explains that she understands her mother is going after [S.H.I.E.L.D.](/wiki/S.H.I.E.L.D.), but that since S.H.I.E.L.D. were always considered good until recently, she is questioning her mother's behavior. Hale realizes that Ruby is asking because of her obsession with the hero \" [Quake](/wiki/Quake)\", who worked for S.H.I.E.L.D., and explains that she simply has to try to capture her since it is her assignment from her superiors, and that her motive is always to help build a better world for everyone, but most importantly Ruby. She promises that when the agents resurface, she will find them and put an end to all the problems they cause.

Noah informs them that the wavelength of the beam is unusual, so it could very well be alien, and the team decide to travel to St. Louis to investigate, with Fitz informing them that he and [Lance Hunter](/wiki/Lance_Hunter)left the [Zephyr One](/wiki/Zephyr_One)cloaked nearby and he can take them to it. Johnson elects to stay behind, worried that she is a liability if she leaves the Lighthouse.

He is immediately awestruck by the beauty of nature in 2017, pre- [destruction of Earth](/wiki/Destruction_of_Earth), and cannot help but walk to a nearby tree and hug it, wanting to learn what trees feel and smell like. A nearby woman looks at him in confusion and he tells her he has just never seen anything like it, but she believes he must be on drugs.

[Leo Fitz](/wiki/Leo_Fitz/Destroyed_Earth)and [Jemma Simmons](/wiki/Jemma_Simmons)then call him over, showing Coulson that the perceived direction that the beam over [St. Louis](/wiki/St._Louis)was traveling in was a result of the low frame rate they were watching at, and that once the rate is increased, it can be seen that it is in fact traveling from the [St. Louis Aerospace Facility](/wiki/St._Louis_Aerospace_Facility)upward into the sky. They then explain that from this discovery, they recognized the beam, telling Coulson that it is in fact the same beacon that [Hive](/wiki/Hive)had used to summon [Yo-Yo Rodriguez](/wiki/Yo-Yo_Rodriguez)and reassures her over her worries from meeting her future self, saying that [Kasius](/wiki/Kasius)used that version of her to manipulate them so she should not trust what she heard too strictly, and asserting that they will change the future anyway.

[[54]](#cite_note-R103-54) - Johnson gets an alert from the local police and is shocked when she finds that the arrested individual is [Deke Shaw](/wiki/Deke_Shaw), believing him to have remained in [2091](/wiki/2091). She realizes that since they are the only people Shaw knows in 2017, he might end up spilling their secrets, and reluctantly decides to go to pick him up from the police station. [[220]](#cite_note-AoS511-220) [[221]](#cite_note-AoS5_December_2017_Placement-221) - The team arrive at St. Louis Aerospace Facility and enter with caution when Fitz finds the heat signature of a person inside. However, the group are relieved when they find that it is Agent [Piper](/wiki/Piper), who appears happy to see them after months of searching with no avail.

When the officers ask her name, she goes with the first that comes to mind: her opponent from 2091, \"Sinara\", adding \"Smith\" as [[220]](#cite_note-AoS511-220) [[221]](#cite_note-AoS5_December_2017_Placement-221) [Candice Lee](/wiki/Candice_Lee)informs her boss, General [Hale](/wiki/Hale), that they have received a call about the location of Coulson's agents of [S.H.I.E.L.D.](/wiki/S.H.I.E.L.D.). She instructs Lee to reply to the informant that they need to be kept at the location.

She tells them that she had worked out the beacon was [Hive](/wiki/Hive)'s, pointing out that she remembered it from the [Battle of Union City](/wiki/Battle_of_Union_City)as that mission had been her first among the higher ranks and had meant a lot to her, then she had come to the facility to warn workers and prepare for any incoming Kree. As they speak, the beacon suddenly starts up again. [[220]](#cite_note-AoS511-220) [[221]](#cite_note-AoS5_December_2017_Placement-221) - Johnson retrieves Shaw from the station, improvising the details of her fake identity as she is forced to fill out the necessary paperwork. Shaw explains what happened with the Monolith shard in 2091, and Johnson is surprised when Shaw's tone does not come across as upset or in shock. He tells her that he is excited because he had thought he was going to die, yet had not only survived but ended up in a world with outdoors and air and sunshine.

[Piper](/wiki/Piper)suddenly pulls a gun on them, revealing that it was her, as the beacon had been activated to lure them in. A group of [figures](/wiki/Sleeper_Mechs)looking like men in black armor arrive at the facility to take the agents, with a leader dressed in grey. [[220]](#cite_note-AoS511-220) [[221]](#cite_note-AoS5_December_2017_Placement-221) - Piper explains that she had been found by General [Hale](/wiki/Hale)but had made a deal to set a trap the rest of the agents, under the promise that if she helped take them in then they would be guaranteed safety. However, in the next room, the leader in grey gives the order for the soldiers to kill the agents. [Yo-Yo Rodriguez](/wiki/Yo-Yo_Rodriguez)uses her super-speed to disarm the soldiers, so instead of shooting them, a fight breaks out between the two groups. Piper is confused as she had been told the mission was \"capture, not kill\". [[220]](#cite_note-AoS511-220) [[221]](#cite_note-AoS5_December_2017_Placement-221) - As the fight continues, [Alphonso Mackenzie](/wiki/Alphonso_Mackenzie)shoots one soldier in the face, and the damaged helmet reveals that underneath is not a human but an android. Piper tells [Phil Coulson](/wiki/Phil_Coulson)that she had trusted Hale as a member of the [United States Armed Forces](/wiki/United_States_Armed_Forces), but he says she has been deceived. Realizing her mistake, she tells the group she will cover for them as they make their escape. [[220]](#cite_note-AoS511-220) [[221]](#cite_note-AoS5_December_2017_Placement-221) - Rodriguez sees Mackenzie being beaten by an android across the room and uses her super-speed to run at him, but just as she does so, the leader in grey throws a [Chakram](/wiki/Chakram)at her. It is perfectly timed to catch her as she runs, and the ring slices through both of Rodriguez's arms. [[220]](#cite_note-AoS511-220) [[221]](#cite_note-AoS5_December_2017_Placement-221) - Mackenzie rushes to Rodriguez's aid as she stands in shock. He finds a blanket to wrap her in and carries her away with the rest of the group as they escape the [St. Louis Aerospace Facility](/wiki/St._Louis_Aerospace_Facility). She mutters that the future they visited is already coming true. [[220]](#cite_note-AoS511-220) [[221]](#cite_note-AoS5_December_2017_Placement-221) - Fitz manages to deactivate the beacon, finding that someone installed a power source by hand. [Deke Shaw](/wiki/Deke_Shaw)and [Daisy Johnson](/wiki/Daisy_Johnson)return to the [Lighthouse](/wiki/Lighthouse), and Johnson gets a call from [Melinda May](/wiki/Melinda_May). She begins a light-hearted conversation, but May requests the landing coordinates urgently, causing Johnson to realize that something has gone horribly wrong. [[220]](#cite_note-AoS511-220) [[221]](#cite_note-AoS5_December_2017_Placement-221) - The agents land back at the Lighthouse at night.

General [Hale](/wiki/Hale)asks her what she was thinking in letting the agents go and cutting off Rodriguez's arms. Ruby explains that she had been promised a chance to deal with Daisy Johnson, and since she was not there, she had chosen instead to force them to seek medical attention, hoping it will get the group where they need them to be, as well as claiming that her attack will make Johnson more desperate to be involved in the future and join the rest of the group. Hale says she is sloppy. Ruby claims that it does not matter, because the group took the beacon, which had been set up as a trap as a back-up plan. Hale says, however, that they should not have had to resort to the beacon, calling her daughter a disappointment before leaving her room, which is in fact a part of the HYDRA Preparatory Academy. [[220]](#cite_note-AoS511-220) [[221]](#cite_note-AoS5_December_2017_Placement-221) [Daisy Johnson](/wiki/Daisy_Johnson)goes to find [Leo Fitz](/wiki/Leo_Fitz/Destroyed_Earth)in the basement storage facility to make certain he has checked they are not being trapped. He says he has, and that they are currently just waiting for its internal circuitry to cool down. Noah continues monitoring it and notices, however, that the circuitry is instead heating up. Realizing that it is set to explode, he instructs the agents to run. They escape just in time as the beacon detonates. [[220]](#cite_note-AoS511-220) [[221]](#cite_note-AoS5_December_2017_Placement-221) 5th[ ] - In [Philadelphia](/wiki/Philadelphia), [Carl Creel](/wiki/Carl_Creel)is out running when General [Hale](/wiki/Hale)stops him in a car. He says he is not interesting in working for her, but she tells him she does not want to use him, but rather is \"putting together a team\". He reluctantly opens the car door and gets in. [[220]](#cite_note-AoS511-220) [[221]](#cite_note-AoS5_December_2017_Placement-221) [Leo Fitz](/wiki/Leo_Fitz/Destroyed_Earth)sends a [D.W.A.R.F.](/wiki/D.W.A.R.F.s)to investigate the wreckage of the basement storage facility. The drone finds a rift, created by the simultaneous destruction of the Monoliths, which blew a hole in spacetime and is causing the bleeding of Monolith energy. The D.W.A.R.F. is then swatted out of the air, however, by a being exactly resembling [Lash](/wiki/Lash). [[221]](#cite_note-AoS5_December_2017_Placement-221) [[222]](#cite_note-AoS512-222) - of his D.W.A.R.F.s had flown down to a level 150 feet below them, and yet when the elevator doors opened, it had found a forest behind the doors. He explains the rift that the D.W.A.R.F. in the basement found, seemingly to another dimension, and how that must somehow have caused the strange anomaly. The group worry that while this could mean [Daisy Johnson](/wiki/Daisy_Johnson)is not behind the end of the world, that would only be because this rift could in fact already be the beginning of the end. [[221]](#cite_note-AoS5_December_2017_Placement-221) [[222]](#cite_note-AoS512-222) [Jemma Simmons](/wiki/Jemma_Simmons)tends to [Yo-Yo Rodriguez](/wiki/Yo-Yo_Rodriguez)as she lies in the hospital bed they have set up for her. When [Alphonso Mackenzie](/wiki/Alphonso_Mackenzie)arrives, Simmons leaves to allow them some private time together. Mackenzie promises he will do everything he can to help Rodriguez and apologizes for struggling to remain calm, as he could not bear watching her be dismembered, especially after everything they had just been through in [2091](/wiki/2091). They discuss the upcoming problems they may have to face together, as Rodriguez points out that everything her future self told her appears to be coming true. [[221]](#cite_note-AoS5_December_2017_Placement-221) [[222]](#cite_note-AoS512-222) 6th[ ] [Deke Shaw](/wiki/Deke_Shaw)and [Daisy Johnson](/wiki/Daisy_Johnson)pick up items from the supply pantry. Shaw is fascinated by orange-scented spray, mistakenly spraying it into his own mouth, exasperating Johnson. He explains to her how hard it was to acquire fruit in the future, but that his [mother](/wiki/Alya_Shaw)would find him an orange every year for his birthday. He asks Johnson about her parents, but she explains that she grew up in an orphanage, and he apologizes for asking her about a touchy subject. [[221]](#cite_note-AoS5_December_2017_Placement-221) [[222]](#cite_note-AoS512-222) - Suddenly, the pair are ambushed by what appears to be a [Kree](/wiki/Kree)warrior, whose presence they do not understand. They fight back, but the Kree beats Shaw and moves to kill him. Before he can finish the attack, Johnson manages to shoot the warrior through the head, and it further confuses them when the warrior then dissolves into wisps of smoke. [[221]](#cite_note-AoS5_December_2017_Placement-221) [[222]](#cite_note-AoS512-222) - With the agents back together in the control room, [Leo Fitz](/wiki/Leo_Fitz/Destroyed_Earth)explains to them his conclusion: seeping through the rift is some sort of \"Fear Dimension\", which can understand their thoughts and physically manifest beings to represent their greatest fears - mistaking the mere Monolith energy with a leak from another dimension, given he does not know the third Monolith is one of creation [[223]](#cite_note-223). He shows the team that he has salvaged further footage from the basement D.W.A.R.F., and has found video of what appears to be Lash, which May affirms would indeed be her greatest fear, with Johnson explaining the Kree Warrior is hers, and Shaw saying the forest, as the overwhelming opposite of the dark, enclosed, and lifeless space he has lived his whole life, is his. [[221]](#cite_note-AoS5_December_2017_Placement-221) [[222]](#cite_note-AoS512-222) - Fitz explains that he thinks he might know how to close the rift, but that his only current idea might involve someone having to sacrifice themselves. He turns to Deke Shaw, who panics, thinking he is asking for him to be the one to die, but Fitz calmly clarifies he is simply requesting his [Gravity Puck](/wiki/Gravity_Puck)belt buckle, as he thinks he can modify it to use the gravitonium inside to force the rift to close. [Phil Coulson](/wiki/Phil_Coulson)then insists that he will be the one to take the risk of taking the device to the rift. [[221]](#cite_note-AoS5_December_2017_Placement-221) [[222]](#cite_note-AoS512-222) - The team stop Coulson as he tries to walk away, angrily telling him he cannot just make the decision for them. [Daisy Johnson](/wiki/Daisy_Johnson)says she wants to go instead, since her being around is already putting everyone at risk, but Coulson insists she is needed to help lead [S.H.I.E.L.D.](/wiki/S.H.I.E.L.D.)in the future. Johnson becomes distressed, telling him there is no longer a \"S.H.I.E.L.D.\", just scraps of a team who are wanted criminals and barely holding together, but he stubbornly tells her that the idea that S.H.I.E.L.D. represents is vital. However, as he tries to make his point, he loses his breath and suddenly collapses, confusing the rest of the team. [[221]](#cite_note-AoS5_December_2017_Placement-221) [[222]](#cite_note-AoS512-222) - After Coulson wakes, the rest of the team wait for him in the control room to discuss Simmons' medical analysis of him. Before he goes to them, Coulson sends Deke Shaw away on a secret mission outdoors, as he is the only one of them who is not on the wanted list. [[221]](#cite_note-AoS5_December_2017_Placement-221) [[222]](#cite_note-AoS512-222) - Coulson gets back to the control room, and [Jemma Simmons](/wiki/Jemma_Simmons)delivers the news of what she has found. She struggles to tell them, choking on her words as she tries not to cry, that Coulson's necrotic tissue from his death in [2012](/wiki/2012)is branching out from his lungs again, as if his resurrection is being undone. Coulson confesses that when he made the deal with [Ghost Rider](/wiki/Ghost_Rider)to take on the [Spirit of Vengeance](/wiki/Spirit_of_Vengeance), he had known the cost: the spirit would burn through the [GH.325](/wiki/GH.325)formula's reviving effects on his dead tissue. Simmons adds that since the tissue is already dead, there is no curing it, and Coulson is dying again. [[221]](#cite_note-AoS5_December_2017_Placement-221) [[222]](#cite_note-AoS512-222) - The team struggle to come to terms with their leader and friend's coming death, with Johnson letting out her emotions by angrily asking him why he did not tell them before. He explains that he felt their ongoing issues were more pressing, but Johnson points out that in [2091](/wiki/2091), they had an option for saving him, the way [Tess](/wiki/Tess)had been revived. Coulson says he did not want to go through an unnatural [Kree](/wiki/Kree)revival again, but Johnson claims he had no right to just give up, especially when he makes decisions about their lives and deaths all the time, saying they deserved to be involved in the decision-making in return, before walking off in tears. Simmons says she cannot know how long Coulson has left until she can chart the necrotic tissue's progression, but that at some point, his heart will simply stop beating. [[221]](#cite_note-AoS5_December_2017_Placement-221) [[222]](#cite_note-AoS512-222) - Coulson follows after Johnson to comfort her, as she is hurting the most of all of them. She says that she cannot take on the responsibility he is giving her. He reassures her that she has always been capable of more than she imagined, but she says that everything she has built in the past few years has been because of him and what he gave to her, so she does not feel any confidence without him. She cries, saying there is not just no S.H.I.E.L.D. without him, but there is simply nothing in their lives without him, and she desperately hugs him, weeping into his shoulder. [[221]](#cite_note-AoS5_December_2017_Placement-221) [[222]](#cite_note-AoS512-222) - At 6:43AM, Rodriguez lies in her hospital bed and is visited by what appears to be Simmons. \"Simmons\" begins to speak cruelly, telling Rodriguez that she is causing [Alphonso Mackenzie](/wiki/Alphonso_Mackenzie)suffering and should spare them all, shocking Rodriguez. \"Simmons\", who is an [LMD](/wiki/LMD)manifested by the Monoliths, suddenly begins to smother her with her pillow in an attempt to kill her. Mackenzie arrives at that moment and attacks the manifestation, knocking its face off to reveal the LMD robotics underneath. The real Jemma Simmons follows him into the room, accompanied by [Leo Fitz](/wiki/Leo_Fitz), and shoots the LMD, and it dissolves into smoke just like the Kree warrior. Fitz tells them that this means the rift is spreading even further, and they have to seal it urgently. [[221]](#cite_note-AoS5_December_2017_Placement-221) [[222]](#cite_note-AoS512-222) [Deke Shaw](/wiki/Deke_Shaw)heads out into [River's End](/wiki/River%27s_End), and finds [United States Armed Forces](/wiki/United_States_Armed_Forces)military throughout the town, searching for the agents. [[221]](#cite_note-AoS5_December_2017_Placement-221) [[222]](#cite_note-AoS512-222) - General [Hale](/wiki/Hale)sits with one of the officers who arrested Shaw 2 days prior, who tells her that his colleague believes the woman who came to pick up Shaw looked like [Daisy Johnson](/wiki/Daisy_Johnson)from the wanted posters. Hale tells him she is greatly appreciative of the lead, as Johnson has not been sighted in months. [[221]](#cite_note-AoS5_December_2017_Placement-221) [[222]](#cite_note-AoS512-222) - Shaw goes to use a public phone for the first time, to make a call as Coulson instructed him to do. [[221]](#cite_note-AoS5_December_2017_Placement-221) [[222]](#cite_note-AoS512-222) - Hale asks the officer about Deke Shaw, but he tells her that he was drunk and disorderly and did not seem particularly intelligent. [[221]](#cite_note-AoS5_December_2017_Placement-221) [[222]](#cite_note-AoS512-222) - Shaw makes a call to \"Fiona\", but cannot get through. [[221]](#cite_note-AoS5_December_2017_Placement-221) [[222]](#cite_note-AoS512-222) - The officer tells Hale that when they looked up Shaw, they could find no history behind his name. [[221]](#cite_note-AoS5_December_2017_Placement-221) [[222]](#cite_note-AoS512-222) - Shaw leaves a pawn shop, which is also selling an [Iron Man](/wiki/Iron_Man)helmet toy, [Thor](/wiki/Thor)and [Hawkeye](/wiki/Hawkeye)figurines, a [Hulk](/wiki/Hulk)mask, an axe, and a cello, with the items Coulson sent him to pick up. As he walks out, he accidentally bumps into one of Hale's agents, who becomes suspicious of him. [[221]](#cite_note-AoS5_December_2017_Placement-221) [[222]](#cite_note-AoS512-222) - Coulson reassures May that he is at peace with his death, but that he is not giving up otherwise and will do his absolute best to make it back out of the basement after closing the rift. [[221]](#cite_note-AoS5_December_2017_Placement-221) [[222]](#cite_note-AoS512-222) [Leo Fitz](/wiki/Leo_Fitz/Destroyed_Earth)prepares [Phil Coulson](/wiki/Phil_Coulson)to head downstairs to the rift, giving him a gun to deal with any potential fear manifestations and the [device](/wiki/Gravity_Containment_Device)he has made out of Shaw's [Gravity Puck](/wiki/Gravity_Puck). Coulson tells him that if he does not return, Fitz needs to make sure he proceeds with the secret thing they have been planning. Fitz is dismissive, saying what they are planning is simply symbolic, but Coulson reminds him that symbols and institutions can be very important. [[221]](#cite_note-AoS5_December_2017_Placement-221) [[222]](#cite_note-AoS512-222) - Coulson takes the elevator down to the basement, but as he steps out into the corridor, the team lose visual contact with him. [[221]](#cite_note-AoS5_December_2017_Placement-221) [[222]](#cite_note-AoS512-222) - Having prepared to see manifestations of fears, Coulson is taken aback when he instead finds what appears to be [Mike Peterson](/wiki/Mike_Peterson/Monolith_Recreation)in the basement. \"Peterson\" tells Coulson that he is here to explain the truth to him of what has really been happening. \"Peterson\" begins to tell Coulson that his own brain is making everything up, saying that Coulson has never actually been to any of the places he thinks he has been in the last few years. [[221]](#cite_note-AoS5_December_2017_Placement-221) [[222]](#cite_note-AoS512-222) - Without visual contact, the team become anxious about Coulson. [Daisy Johnson](/wiki/Daisy_Johnson)wants to go down after him, but Fitz tells her that they cannot risk losing two people. May assures them that he will make it back, and they just need to hold on. [[221]](#cite_note-AoS5_December_2017_Placement-221) [[222]](#cite_note-AoS512-222) - \"Peterson\" tells Coulson that the reason his mind has manifested all these supposed fantasies of years of adventures is that he is in fact still on the operating table in [2012](/wiki/2012)following [Loki](/wiki/Loki)stabbing him through the chest, and as his brain is stimulated by electricity trying to revive him, his conscience is trying to make sense of random synapses firing off. \"Peterson\" claims that he is just an emergency medical technician Coulson barely registered in his near-dead state and his brain incorporated into these fantasies, and says that Coulson's experience of his head catching fire was merely the pain of the electrodes on his brain, and that his Framework life as a history teacher was just a memory of his father's profession. Coulson defies him, saying that the man is just the physical manifestation of his fear of death, but \"Peterson\" continues that his mind is just creating this story to satisfy him with the adventures he missed out on experiencing when his life was cut short. [[221]](#cite_note-AoS5_December_2017_Placement-221) [[222]](#cite_note-AoS512-222) - The agents in the control room scan an aircraft incoming and are worried that Hale's people have found them. However, as they check the scan, they realize it is a [Quinjet](/wiki/Quinjet), which then radios in asking permission to land. The team are confused and still cautious, going to meet the landing jet with guns at the ready, but when the door opens, they find [Deke Shaw](/wiki/Deke_Shaw)inside having gathered a group of [S.H.I.E.L.D.](/wiki/S.H.I.E.L.D.)agents for support, including Agent [James Davis](/wiki/James_Davis), whom they had thought dead, and the [[221]](#cite_note-AoS5_December_2017_Placement-221) [[222]](#cite_note-AoS512-222) [Closure of to convince [Phil Coulson](/wiki/Phil_Coulson)to walk into the rift, to supposedly accept the fake nature of his reality and give in to his death, but Coulson manages to remain steadfast in his belief in his life and the people around him, telling \"Peterson\" that he is not buying his story. The manifestation goes to grab him and force him into the rift, but at that moment, the real Peterson arrives in the basement and blasts him from the corner. The Monoliths begin to create various further recreations to fight back against the threat of Coulson closing the rift, manifesting forms of [Lash](/wiki/Lash/Monolith_Recreation)and [Vrellnexians](/wiki/Vrellnexians). Coulson and Deathlok work together to shoot and dissolve each recreation, however, until Coulson manages to throw Fitz's [gravitonium](/wiki/Gravitonium) [device](/wiki/Gravity_Containment_Device)into the rift, beginning to close it. In one last attack, the Monoliths create [Hive](/wiki/Hive/Monolith_Recreation)to take down the men in retaliation, but Deathlok blasts the recreation through the head, and the rift finally closes. [[221]](#cite_note-AoS5_December_2017_Placement-221) [[222]](#cite_note-AoS512-222) [Candice Lee](/wiki/Candice_Lee)reports back to General [Hale](/wiki/Hale)that they, too, have been unable to find anything from [Deke Shaw](/wiki/Deke_Shaw)'s fingerprints or DNA. She also passes on that they have had further reports of [Daisy Johnson](/wiki/Daisy_Johnson)being sighted, but Hale says that either Johnson will have left by now, or S.H.I.E.L.D. might be luring them into a trap, telling Lee that instead, they should pack up their investigation. [[221]](#cite_note-AoS5_December_2017_Placement-221) [[222]](#cite_note-AoS512-222) - Phil Coulson, [Leo Fitz](/wiki/Leo_Fitz/Destroyed_Earth), and [Deke Shaw](/wiki/Deke_Shaw)take the elevator together. Fitz explains that the device is working, at least temporarily, keeping the rift closed, saying the anomalies are fading and no more are currently occurring. He says they have one man to thank for their success, and Shaw mistakenly believes they are talking about him, thanking them for appreciating his efforts and proudly saying how he did everything Coulson asked, circulating fake sightings of Daisy Johnson, collecting the other agents, and picking up everything from the checklist of items for the evening's plans, exaggerating the hardships he had to overcome to perform the simple tasks. Fitz explains that he thought it was obvious that he was talking about Deathlok, and asks Coulson if he will be staying around, but Coulson explains Peterson will be leaving tonight.

She tells him about the lights, which he attributes simply to drug-taking, and she does not pursue the conversation further. Dean asks Stein to stay with her in the car, and they set off, deciding not to go to her home, but instead the [Wilder Mansion](/wiki/Wilder_Mansion).

Yorkes pushes [Molly Hernandez](/wiki/Molly_Hernandez)back from their balcony, worried that her little sister will never be able to forget the horrible sight of what is going on. The box opens and a light comes out of it, as [Geoffrey Wilder](/wiki/Geoffrey_Wilder)and [Robert Minoru](/wiki/Robert_Minoru)bend down to pick up Gonzalez.

Geoffrey and Catherine undress as Alex and his friends reach the top of the stairs, but find the door closed. Stein suggests that he attempts to open it, but fails, just as the Wilder parents finish dressing and head up the passageway. The combined strength of the 17-year-olds still proves to be insufficient, but as Hernandez hears footsteps, she becomes afraid and her super-strength kicks in, allowing the group to escape.

He begins asking her questions, but she says he will have his questions answered when her mother wants them answered.

He explains that he remembers her from his childhood, having played with her when their parents had meetings, and remembered her hitting her head on the kitchen counter.

[[240]](#cite_note-R2_December_2017-January_2018_Placement-240) [[241]](#cite_note-R201-241) - In [PRIDE Headquarters](/wiki/PRIDE_Headquarters), the parents discuss the death of [Graciela Aguirre](/wiki/Graciela_Aguirre)at the hands of [Tina Minoru](/wiki/Tina_Minoru), who shows no remorse. They present their findings about Gene and Alice Hernandez's video, with Tina having scanned the remainder of the broken tape, and about the energy readings they are getting from the bottom of Jonah's PRIDE construction site hole. Janet Stein is relieved that their children managed to delay the excavation process. Robert Minoru says that obtaining what Jonah needs would cause massive earthquakes, and the Yorkeses reveal that whatever is at the bottom is emitting massive energy like a living being. Tina offers to be PRIDE's leader in their mission to kill Jonah, whom the Yorkeses confirm has DNA that heals itself, and Geoffrey Wilder Universe alludes to events which happened in our world, and it is assumed they happened on the same dates in the universe, for timeline purposes. - [2.0](#cite_ref-HE101_2-0) [2.1](#cite_ref-HE101_2-1) [Hawkeye: [Ribbit and Rip It](/wiki/Ribbit_and_Rip_It), Todd Phelps says that he studied abroad in Wakanda. Based on Jon Bass' age at the time of filming [She-Hulk: Attorney at Law](/wiki/She-Hulk:_Attorney_at_Law), Phelps would have graduated college before Wakanda opens its national borders on October 8, 2016 (see [2016](/wiki/2016)references). It can therefore be taken that Phelps is younger than Bass and that he studied in Wakanda the first semester after its borders opened, the Spring 2017 semester. - [6.0](#cite_ref-SMNWH_6-0) [6.1](#cite_ref-SMNWH_6-1) a flashback is shown to Dinah Madani being questioned in hospital, \"one year ago\" before May 8, 2018 (see [2018](/wiki/2018)references). This would make the scene 2017. However, it is set very shortly after Madani is taken to hospital on December 16, 2016 (see [2016](/wiki/2016)references) and around the time of the epilogue of [Memento Mori](/wiki/Memento_Mori), December 19, 2016 (see 2016 references). Therefore, it can be taken to be as close as possible to December 2016 while still in 2017, so January 1, 2017 - 13 days after the end of Memento Mori, but still just about \"one year ago\" before May 2018. - six months on a plane with [Mackenzie].\" It is said in [Vendetta](/wiki/Vendetta)that \"Coulson had just stepped down\" in the scene in which we see him heading off to board the Zephyr for the beginning of the six-month span. Due to the April 17, 2017 date in [Wake Up](/wiki/Wake_Up_(episode)), [The Ghost](/wiki/The_Ghost)ideally picks up in March 2017 (see other references). Working back from this, the events of [Agents of S.H.I.E.L.D.: Slingshot](/wiki/Agents_of_S.H.I.E.L.D.:_Slingshot), and the first boarding of the Zephyr, is in September 2016. This works with Slingshot, as it picks up just before [Broken Promises](/wiki/Broken_Promises)on April 13, 2017 (see other references), it then flashes back to the Baltimore incident, referring to it as \"Several months ago\". With the Baltimore event on September 30, 2016, this is 7 months prior. It is dated as late September - September 30, 2016, to allow time for Mace being selected for, and then go through Project Patriot, but still fit with Mace's statement in [The Patriot](/wiki/The_Patriot), \"Few months [after Vienna], Talbot came to me with an offer.\" This still fits, with the bombing being on June 23rd, and his selection being September 8th, 2\u00bd months later. It is implied that Mackenzie and Coulson began testing the limits of the Zephyr, to go for weeks and weeks on a thorough hunt for Johnson, and that the director wanted to keep [Coulson's Team](/wiki/Coulson%27s_Team)apart after he took over, as the duo get to only see their friends every few weeks when coming back for restock. They get back after their last trip of 6 weeks (their furthest yet, impressing Fitz), and Fitz and Simmons are excited to see them, with Fitz exclaiming, \"Six weeks. That's a record!\" Coulson at this point has indeed spent 6 months with Mackenzie living mostly on the plane - September 30, 2016 to March 18, Bishop says that she broke her arm swinging on her family's chandelier. Bishop started her training to be active on May 10, 2012 (see [2012](/wiki/2012)references), so it likely occurred after then. This also would have occurred before she went to college and stopped living in the penthouse. In [Ronin](/wiki/Ronin_(episode)), Yelena Belova says that Bishop is a senior, so her freshman year would have started in September 2021. Bishop breaking her arm can therefore be approximated to the middle of these dates, January 4, 2017. [](#cite_ref-15)In [Revelations](/wiki/Revelations), Theo Nelson says that \"a few months\" after the Nelson's Meats suppliers stopped taking orders on September 24, 2016 (see [2016](/wiki/2016)references), Red Lion National Bank reached out. Taking this to mean approximately 3.5 months, Red Lion reaching out can be approximated to January 5, 2017. [](#cite_ref-16) [Cloak & Dagger: Season 1 is O'Reilly's first case in New Orleans](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y9d8dOY7e58&t=1382s), implying she moved approximately a month before the case on February 15, that he's in recovery, I think it's between 3 and 6 months. Yeah, I think it's about 3 to 6 months. Somewhere in there [...] I think - gosh, don't hold me to this because again I haven't thought about this in a long time [...] but I think it's about a year from the beginning of the movie to his return to New York. And so, [...] I think it starts early fall, to late fall, so it's a little over a year, because I think it's like winter-y when he has the fight with Christine, it's like that cold, New York, really dark grey, nearly snowing kind of vibe.\"](https://www.empireonline.com/movies/news/empire-podcast-doctor-strange-spoiler-special-scott-derrickson/) On the day of Strange's car crash, he checks his watch and [it says \"TUE\", \"2016\", \"FEB\", \"2\"](/wiki/File:DS_Promo_Clip_-_The_Multiverse_7.png), making it Tuesday, February 2, 2016. While this does not fit with the fact that WHiH [tweeted on May 2, 2016](https://twitter.com/WHIHOfficial/status/727256906952138753)and posted a [video](/wiki/WHIH_Newsfront_Exclusive:_President_Ellis_Discusses_the_Avengers)on May 3, 2016 (and [WHiH Newsfront](/wiki/WHiH_Newsfront_(web_series))is proven to be set in real time, ( [1](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HkZwlIYLNBQ), [2](https://twitter.com/WHIHOfficial/status/616657863876956160), [3](https://twitter.com/WHIHOfficial/status/617408255283884032), [4](https://twitter.com/WHIHOfficial/status/723617629328416768), and other dialogue in videos matching with dates given)) about Strange being a surgeon, Scott Derrickson [tweeted to confirm the February 2nd date](https://twitter.com/scottderrickson/status/959550885075468288)as well as retweeting another post about it. With the beginning of the film in \"early fall\" and the end of the film in \"late fall\", \"a little over a year\" later, and the February 2016 car crash falling between the two, this would mean the film begins around early Fall 2015 and ends around late Fall 2016. However, Derrickson also says that Strange recovers for 3-6 months, and [Mads Mikkelsen says Strange trains for \"9 months\" before his clash with Kaecilius](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pYxmUMCNxCo), which overall would suggest the film ends 12-15 months after Strange's car crash, thus placing the ending around February-May 2017. This, in turn, using Derrickson's comment about \"a little over a year\" (\"early\" one season to \"late\" the same season a year later would mean 4 seasons, so about 14 months), would, working backwards, place the opening of the film between December 2015 and February 2016 (the latest it can be, before Strange's car crash). Overall, using weighted math from all the evidence available, the details of which can be seen [here](/wiki/User:Marvelus/Phase_Three_Timeline#Doctor_Strange), the result is that the opening is October 13, 2015, the car crash February 2, 2016, the argument with Christine March 29, 2016, Strange's arrival in Kathmandu May 4, 2016, and the climax January 18-19, 2017. This would put the opening still in the early part of fall (working with Derrickson's comment), the argument with Christine towards the end of the snowy period and a bit after winter, but enough time after Strange's crash and a good time for the heavy rain (a bit later than Derrickson's comment but realistic), his arrival in Kathmandu 3 months after his crash (just fitting inside Derrickson's 3-6 months comment), the climax another 8.5 months later (just fitting for Mikkelsen's \"9 months\" comment), and the climax a bit after Fall 2016, instead Winter 2016-17 (a bit later than Derrickson's comment) but fitting as \"a little over a year\" (15 months) after the opening (fitting reasonably with Derrickson's comment), a realistic time of year for the snowfall at the Ancient One's death, and working with the other comments just described. This also works fine considering Derrickson made it clear he did not want to be fully held to his comments. The specific dates of smaller events in between can also be found is said that Billy Russo \"was in a coma for 6 weeks\". He entered his coma on Friday, December 16, 2016 (see [2016](/wiki/2016)references), so him waking can be taken to be around an exact 6 weeks later, Friday, January 27, 2017, or more generally the 6th week after, Sunday, January 22-Saturday, January 28, 2017, therefore approximating with the middle of the week, Wednesday, January 25, 2017. Overall, it can be estimated that he woke on Thursday, January 26, 2017. [](#cite_ref-29)In [AKA Three Lives and Counting](/wiki/AKA_Three_Lives_and_Counting), on May 27, 2017 (see other references), it is said that the \"marine biologists have been in the Pacific Ocean for nearly 4 months\". This would suggest approximately 3.8-3.9 months ago. Using approximately 3.85 months prior would give February 1, the lead-up to Mardi Gras in February, and includes the 8-year anniversary of the oil rig explosion, tying them explicitly to being exactly 8 years apart, both in February of their respective years. However, the evidence for which years (if the explosion was 2007 and present 2015, explosion 2008 and present 2016, explosion 2009 and present 2017, explosion 2010 and present 2018) is extremely contradictory. The total evidence for a February 2007 accident and February 2015 present events: - In [First Light](/wiki/First_Light), security footage of Tyrone stealing the car radio says \"2007-04-18\". This does not match as any February, though is closest to February 2007. - Jeph Loeb stated about the Marvel Television seasons released between April 27, 2018 and April 26, 2019, [\"For the most part our stories will take place BEFORE Thanos clicked his fingers,\"](https://www.reddit.com/r/marvelstudios/comments/8pbxyk/im_jeph_loeb_head_of_marvel_tv_ama/e0a5ju5/)and later made more clear, [\"The short answer is that the stories that you're seeing, unless otherwise noted, all happen before [...] \"the Thanos Snap\". And we'll continue to be in that place until we find out what happens in Avengers 4,\"](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9UqrlizXWIM&t=2015s)Season 1 and the first half of Season 2 released in this period, meaning they are set before [Avengers: Infinity War](/wiki/Avengers:_Infinity_War)in Spring/early Summer 2018. Since Season 2 takes place explicitly 8 months later in October, then it cannot be later than October 2017, making Season 1 February 2015, 2016, or 2017 - not 2018. - In [Call/Response](/wiki/Call/Response), a poster is up at the Wild Red Hawks for an event on \"Friday, Jan. 30\". January 30th was a Friday in 2015, though it could just be a much older poster left up for commemorative reasons. - In First Light, security footage of Tyrone stealing the car radio says \"2007-04-18\". This does not match as any February, though it would make most sense in-universe for it to be February 2008, with the camera clock set back several months by accident due to something like a reset. - In [Suicide Sprints](/wiki/Suicide_Sprints), Adina Johnson's vision shows the \"missing\" dates of her children as being \"6/6/08\". The closest February is 2008, and this would make sense, for her to still be very anxious about a second child dying 4 months later, and the 6/6/08 actually being the date of her anxiety rather than the date of Billy's death. - In Call/Response, [Shadow Selves](/wiki/Shadow_Selves), and [Rabbit Hold](/wiki/Rabbit_Hold), it is shown in obituaries that Billy Johnson was born on \"August 1, 1990\" and died aged \"17\", with another obituary in [Princeton Offense](/wiki/Princeton_Offense)also saying he was 17. If he were born in August 1990, the February where he was 17 would have been 2008. - In Princeton Offense, Peter Scarborough's Wikipedia page says, \"In 2009, after supervising the Roxxon cleanup effort in New Orleans following an oil rig explosion, Scarborough transitioned to a consulting position.\" This could potentially work with the accident being February 2008, with cleanup in 2008 and then Scarborough moving on in early 2009. - Jeph Loeb's statement as mentioned. [Emma Lahana says this is O'Reilly's first case in Nandi Tyler says in [Luke Cage](/wiki/Luke_Cage_(TV_series)): [Season 2](/wiki/Luke_Cage_(TV_series)/Season_Two), Episode 8 - [If It Ain't Rough, It Ain't Right](/wiki/If_It_Ain%27t_Rough,_It_Ain%27t_Right), set in August 2017, that O'Reilly has moved to New Orleans. In [Ghost Stories](/wiki/Ghost_Stories), O'Reilly mentions events involving superheroes with her friend Misty Knight in New York, meaning it is after Luke Cage: [Season 1](/wiki/Luke_Cage_(TV_series)/Season_One)in December 2015. If she moved in February 2016, this fits within this range, though it is implied that O'Reilly left during Knight's time away from the force, which would not work with February 2016 since her time off begins in May 2016. - In First Light, a taxi is shown with a \"11 17\" registration sticker, meaning it should be between November 2015 and November 2017. - In [Funhouse Mirrors](/wiki/Funhouse_Mirrors), Stan Bartlett's license plate says \"18\". This means that if he just renewed it in the last several weeks, it could be February 2016, with an expiry date in early 2018. - In First Light, Nathan Bowen's work ID is valid from \"30MAR08\" to \"29MAR10\". - In Suicide Sprints, Adina Johnson's vision shows Tyrone's date of birth as \"8/19/00\", although Billy's says \"02\" which is definitely not his real year of birth, so it can be taken that this is not reliable either. In Call/Response, Season 1, Episode 4, Tyrone say, \"My parents look at me like a liar and a thief ever since I was 8. They don't trust me. Not really. You know, ever since that night.\" If his birthday is indeed August 19, 2000, then the February where he was 8 would be February 2009. - Peter Scarborough's Wikipedia page, as mentioned above, supports 2009 more than it does 2008. - In Princeton Offense, the oil rig schematics are shown to have been on \"9/10/2008\", suggesting the accident was after September 10, 2008. - Jeph Loeb's statement as mentioned. - As mentioned, Emma Lahana says this is O'Reilly's first case in New Orleans and O'Reilly is still in New York in December 2015 but in New Orleans by August 2017. If she moved in February 2017, this is the only February that fits perfectly since it implied that O'Reilly left during Knight's time away from the force, which began in May 2016. - The \"11 17\" taxi registration sticker as mentioned. - In First Light, Tyrone has a leaflet for [\"FREE COMIC BOOK DAY 1st Saturday in May - May 6, 2017\"](https://thetvshows.us/displayimage.php?album=2594&pid=3028413#top_display_media), which would work in February 2017. - As mentioned, there is an (unreliable) August 2000 date of birth given for Tyrone in Suicide Sprints. In the same episode, Tyrone mentions that he has known Father Delgado for 3 years, which would suggests he is in February of junior year, meaning he was born 16.4-17.4 years ago, so since it is an August and date of birth and currently February, he would be 16.5. 16.5 years after August 2000 gives February 2017. - In Call/Response, a magazine says, \"Currently chairs a committee in 2017.\" - Stan Bartlett's license plate as mentioned says \"18\", which means it is between 2016 and 2018. - In [Colony Collapse](/wiki/Colony_Collapse), on Mardi Gras, Scarborough references the surname Rand being a name that means you are known to be rich currently, implying Season 1, Episode 10: The Rands are referred to, suggesting Danny Rand is back in the world. Mardi Gras in 2016 was February 6th, before Danny Rand has returned, so it does not fit with 2016, but would make it February 2017 or 2018. - The basketball state finals occur days before Mardi Gras. The basketball state finals in Louisiana tend to be early March, and 2017 is the year where Mardi Gras is as close as possible to this, on February 28th. - Nathan Bowen's work ID as mentioned. - The oil rig schematic revisions as mentioned. - In First Light, \"Lush Life\" by Leo Islo plays in-universe. This song was put online on March 27, 2017, so the only possible February is 2018. - In First Light, \"Right Now\" by Vindata plays in-universe. This song was put online on February 22, 2017. This is just 12 days too late to fit with February 2017, so the only possible February is 2018. - Tyrone has a \"FREE COMIC BOOK DAY 1st Saturday in May - May 6, 2017\" leaflet as mentioned, which could work with 2018 if you assume he just left it up for several months after. - In Suicide Sprints, Adina Johnson has the book Grief Cottage, which was released August 2017, so the only possible February is 2018. - As mentioned, there is an (unreliable) August 2000 date of birth given for Tyrone in Suicide Sprints. In Rabbit Hold, it is shown on a poster and stated that Tyrone is \"18\". The October where he would be 18 would be October 2018, making Season 1 February 2018. - In Princeton Offense, O'Reilly looks at narcotics arrest files that she describes as being from \"about 8 years ago\", and the files on screen are from \"02/18/2010\", suggesting this is February 2018. - In Princeton Offense, news stories from \"hours ago\" are real life news stories from September 2017. This does not work for any February, though if it has to suggest one it would be February 2018, because at least those stories have happened by then. - Stan Bartlett's license plate as mentioned says \"18\", which works so long as the plate was registered between February and December 2016. - In Ghost Stories, Tyrone's phone says \"Thursday, October 5\". October 5th was a Thursday in 2017, and was the day of filming. This does not work for any February, though if it has to suggest one it would be February 2018, because it is more likely if the phone has the wrong date that it would be a past date, not a future one, if the phone was accidentally reset or something similar. - Scarborough's reference to the Rands as mentioned. - In [Alignment Chart](/wiki/Alignment_Chart), an obituary for Kenneth Fuchs says, \"Fuchs, aged 32, passed away on February 11, Gallagher's age during the filming of [Loki](/wiki/Loki_(TV_series))and working backward from the setting of [Lamentis](/wiki/Lamentis), the Lamentian homesteader can be taken to have been from working back from the March 18, 2017 date of the opening Selves](/wiki/Shadow_Selves), on a Sunday (see other references), it is shown that \"242 days ago\", Mayhem crawled out of the lake - the final scene from [Colony Collapse](/wiki/Colony_Collapse). The events of Colony Collapse otherwise end on March 1, 2017 (see other references), and this scene is implied to be shortly after this. Given that 242 days after March 1, 2017 is a Sunday (October 29, 2017), it can simply be taken that the Mayhem scene was the night of March 1, 2017.

It is not a fully in-universe video such as the [WHiH Newsfront](/wiki/WHiH_Newsfront_(web_series))videos, released through their own channel, but is released as a promo through the Marvel channel with an out-of-universe promo ending, and thus is not released on the matching in-universe date. 16 days prior to The Ghost in the timeline is March visited O'Reilly \"240 days ago\" before October 29, 2017 (see other references), making it March 3, 2017. [](#cite_ref-53)In [Shadow Selves](/wiki/Shadow_Selves), it is shown that Mayhem went to the SRO Hotel \"236 days ago\" before October 29, 2017 (see other references), making it Cup Final](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2016_Scottish_League_Cup_Final_(November))is shown. In real life, this final was on Sunday, November 27, 2016. However, due to the April 17, 2017 hard date from [Wake Up](/wiki/Wake_Up_(episode))(see other references), and this being no more than a month earlier, plus the minimum of \"a few months\" following the Vienna bombing in June 2016 before Mace takes over (as said in [The Patriot](/wiki/The_Patriot)) followed by \"6 months\" of the Zephyr One ( [Wake Up](/wiki/Wake_Up_(episode))), this cannot be the same date in the Marvel Cinematic Universe. It can be assumed because the teams in the final are different as well, that it did indeed occur on a different date. It would occur on a Sunday, meaning the end of [Uprising](/wiki/Uprising_(episode))would be a Thursday, with little time between Uprising and [Let Me Stand Next to Your Fire](/wiki/Let_Me_Stand_Next_to_Your_Fire), which is dated to April 3rd. This means the Thursday is the 23rd or the 30th. In real life, the 2016-17 season was the first time the Scottish League Cup Final was in November, with it always having been March previously. If, for whatever reason, in the Marvel Cinematic Universe, the March date continued into the 2016-17 season, the pattern of dates would put the final on Sunday, March 19, 2017 (meaning the Thursday 23rd), which aligns nicely with both the April date and the \"few months\" + \"6 couple state, on October 24, 2017 (see other references), that they booked their Presidential Hotel room \"months ago\". This could refer to any time from late 2016 to August 2017, but a calculation would suggest they booked around roughly March 26, 2017. [](#cite_ref-60)In [A New Napkin](/wiki/A_New_Napkin), Felix Manning states, on October 31, 2017 (see other references), that Fisk has been \"planning the ceremony for months\". This could refer to any time from late 2016 to early September 2017, but a calculation would suggest he began planning around roughly March 29, 2017. [](#cite_ref-SHAaL104_61-0) [She-Hulk: Attorney at Law: and on-screen time-spans (see other references), [The Laws of Inferno Dynamics](/wiki/The_Laws_of_Inferno_Dynamics)is definitively placed on April 12, 2017. The concluding events of [Deals With Our Devils](/wiki/Deals_With_Our_Devils)could occur anywhere between the day before, up to about a week before. In [Lockup](/wiki/Lockup), there are jokes about it being \"Taco Tuesday,\" and it is said in [The Good Samaritan](/wiki/The_Good_Samaritan)that this was yesterday, putting the events of that episode and Deals With Our Devils on a Wednesday. April 12th was a Wednesday, so the earliest Wednesday before that is April 5th, putting the events of [Let Me Stand Next to Your Fire](/wiki/Let_Me_Stand_Next_to_Your_Fire)to Deals With Our Devils from Beginning](/wiki/AKA_Start_at_the_Beginning), there are 3 events (Jones and Walker meet at night, Jones meets with potential clients, Hogarth gets an award) prior to the main events of [Jessica Jones](/wiki/Jessica_Jones_(TV_series)): [Season 2](/wiki/Jessica_Jones_(TV_series)/Season_Two)beginning on April 28, 2017 (see other references), with each gap undefined, other than that they are shortly before the main events of the season. However, Jones is watching a film on a roof as she and Walker used to do, and Jones says that the man who projects them is \"still here, first Friday every month\", implying that day is the first Friday of the month, so presumably Friday, April 7, 2017. Therefore, the remaining two scenes can be approximated by evenly distributing between the 7th and the 28th - April 14th and 21st respectively. [AKA Freak Accident](/wiki/AKA_Freak_Accident), on May 2, 2017 (see other references), it is shown that Robert Coleman commented on the Trish Talk site 21 days ago, so April 11, 2017, someone complained on the Trish Talk site about the talk of superheroes 20 days ago, so April 12, 2017, Coleman made some web searches 5 days ago, so April 27, 2017, and Coleman commented again on the Trish Talk site 3 days ago, so April 29, is shown that May being replaced by an LMD (during [The Laws of Inferno Dynamics](/wiki/The_Laws_of_Inferno_Dynamics)) happened 5 days before the start of [Wake Up](/wiki/Wake_Up_(episode)), which takes place on April 17th, one day before the birthday of [Hope Mackenzie](/wiki/Hope_Mackenzie)on April 18th.

It is also shown that the events of [The Patriot](/wiki/The_Patriot)were the day before, placing that on April 16th. [](#cite_ref-82)In [No Good Deed](/wiki/No_Good_Deed), Karen Page says on October 24, 2017 (see other references) that Fisk bought the Presidential Hotel \"6 months ago\". This could refer to a near-exact 6 months (around April 24, 2017) or a more general \"October 2017 - April 2017 = 6 months\" (so approximating with mid-April, April 15/16, 2017). Putting more weight on the more specific, a weighted calculation gives the buy as approximately April 21, Vengeance](/wiki/Citadel_on_the_Edge_of_Vengeance), on October 25, 2017 (see other references), Colleen Wing says the cage was shut down \"about 6 months ago\". 6 months prior can be seen as almost exactly 6 months prior, approximately April 25, 2017, or more generally \"October - 6 months = April\", so using mid-April, April 15/16, 2017, as an approximation. Putting more weight in the specific than general, a weighted calculation gives the shutdown as approximately April 22, The May LMD is revealed in [Hot Potato Soup](/wiki/Hot_Potato_Soup). The episode prior, [Wake Up](/wiki/Wake_Up_(episode)), is shown to be \"5 days\" after May's replacement. However, Hot Potato Soup appears to be the day following Wake Up, if not only a few days later. To compromise these two pieces of evidence, it is reasoned as 2 calendar weeks, from her replacement on Wednesday, April 12th (\"5 days\" before Wake Up which is firmly on April 17, 2017 due to it being the day before Hope Mackenzie's birthday, see other references) to Monday, April 24th. 12 days, but 2 calendar weeks - enough to call it \"weeks,\" but with the smallest possible gap between Wake Up and Hot Potato Soup of 7 days. BOOM picks up at least a few days after Hot Potato Soup, but 3 days after BOOM, Self Control shows that it is snowing. With this being late April at the very earliest, the gap between Hot Potato Soup and BOOM has to be minimised to 3 days, taking it to April 27th. BOOM to [Identity and Change](/wiki/Identity_and_Change)then follow subsequently from 9, 2016 (see [2016](/wiki/2016)references) to October 23, 2017 (see other references). With it being difficult to stretch the events of the episode over these 17 months, it would help for Murdock waking from his coma to be as late as realistically possible to minimize the stretching of the scenes after. When Murdock wakes, it is said that he was comatose for \"several weeks\". With him falling unconscious on May 10, 2016, realistically, the latest it should be is the end of June, with early July leaning more toward \"2 months\", so June 30, 2016 can be used. By the time of Benjamin Donovan visiting Wilson Fisk in prison, it is less than a month from October 23, 2017, as Fitz finds out about the troubles with Vanessa Marianna when Donovan visits and then at his next meeting with the FBI wants to make a deal because of it, and the meetings are said to be monthly. So, with it already being a big stretch to have the events span 17 months, the Donovan scene should be as early as possible to minimize the stretching for all scenes up to then, so around September 24, 2017. The scene before, of Murdock moving into the laundry room, is shown to be the same day as Fisk being visited in prison, so September 24, 2017. Therefore, the scene of the orphans visiting Murdock and Page and Nelson discussing Murdock's apartment should be distributed between June 30, 2016 and September 24, 2017, so November 27, 2016 and April 27, 2017 respectively. The scene of Grace taking Lantom to see Murdock training is therefore between September 25, 2017 evening and October 22, 2017 daytime, so around Number](/wiki/AKA_Take_a_Bloody_Number), it is shown that the medical bills for Jessica Jones following her family's car crash are from [\"04/13/00\"](/wiki/File:AKA_Take_a_Bloody_Number_-_04-13-00.jpg). This would suggest that the accident was soon before this date. This fits with the fact that when Jones looks at her diary from her old home in [AKA Top Shelf Perverts](/wiki/AKA_Top_Shelf_Perverts), it is shown to have been her \"1996-1999\" diary, with infrequent entries, the last of which was in September 1999. A 2000 date for the car crash was supported by [Season 2](/wiki/Jessica_Jones_(TV_series)/Season_Two), when, in Episode 1 - [AKA Start at the Beginning](/wiki/AKA_Start_at_the_Beginning), Phillip Jones' ashes box says \"Birth/Death Year: 1990-2000\", and when, in Episode 2 - [AKA Freak Accident](/wiki/AKA_Freak_Accident)and Episode 3 - [AKA Sole Survivor](/wiki/AKA_Sole_Survivor), it is show on death certificates that Brian Jones was born in \"1954\" and died aged \"46\", Alisa Jones was born in \"1956\" and died aged \"44\", and Phillip Jones was born in \"1990\" and died aged \"10\" (which was his age at death given in [AKA WWJD?](/wiki/AKA_WWJD%3F)as well). Throughout Season 2, the car crash is referred to many times as being \"17 years\" ago, placing this firmly in 2017. 3 dates appear in the season, contradictory to each other (there is no possible way to make any of them fit together) - a \"5/5/2017\" date in AKA Sole Survivor, a \"Thursday, June 1\" date in [AKA The Octopus](/wiki/AKA_The_Octopus), and date in [AKA Facetime](/wiki/AKA_Facetime). The \"Wednesday, July 5\" does not work because it is explicitly the day after a \"Sunday\", and neither the \"Thursday, June 1\" nor \"Wednesday, July 5\" dates work since Nichelle tells Malcolm in AKA Facetime that it is \"3 more months till [her] master's\". A master's cannot be taken later than August, making this no later than May. The \"5/5/2017\" date, however, lines up with the evidence: - The scene with Nichelle, a little later in the month, would work as being 3 months until Nichelle's master's in August. - It is just over 3 days since the Empire State Building was shown lit up green - the building was lit up green on the night of May 1st for mental health awareness, and this is now the night of May 4th-5th (early hours of the 5th). - It is a Thursday-Friday night, matching with it being a \"school night\" and the next morning being a Trish Talk day, with Trish Talk being a \"weekday\" show. - It works with the weather, starting colder but, by Episode 4 - [AKA God Help the Hobo](/wiki/AKA_God_Help_the_Hobo), becoming hot. [Melissa Rosenberg stated that the season picks up 6 months to a year after Marvel's The Defenders: Season 1](http://www.newsweek.com/jessica-jones-season-2-timeline-order-how-long-defenders-835820), and April 2017 is 11 months after the season. This means that the main events of the season, from Trish Walker talking to Ian up to Alisa Jones' death, transpire from April 28, 2017 in the Framework, there are lots of references in episodes to events occurring \"today\" or \"yesterday\", tying episodes together. The only episodes with an undefined time gap between them are [Identity and Change](/wiki/Identity_and_Change)and [No Regrets](/wiki/No_Regrets). The date when Johnson and Simmons enter the Framework is reasoned as April 30th (see other references), and in [Farewell, Cruel World!](/wiki/Farewell,_Cruel_World!)it is shown that the beginning of the episode is now 10 days later, putting this on May 10th. This fits, as on May 10th Coulson says that \"up until a week ago\" he would have thought he was mad to believe in the real world, and May says that \"[her] squad's been hunting [Simmons for] the past week.\" These are both references to events on May 1st being roughly a week ago, and the \"10 days\" timespan would put those events 9 days prior, which works well enough as an approximate week, and shows that time in the Framework does indeed pass normally. Identity and Change ends on May 1st, and working back from the May 10th date, No Regrets would begin on May 9th, putting an 8-day gap between the episodes. Placing No Regrets to [World's End](/wiki/World%27s_End)around the May 10th date puts those events from May 9th to May 12th. - [101.0](#cite_ref-AoS419_101-0) [101.1](#cite_ref-AoS419_101-1) [Agents arrested, which is dated to May 12th, and then questioned again the following day, the 13th. 5 scenes then transpire, before the 6th scene, where Fitz is shown drawing his 17th monkey on the cell wall, indicating his 17th day in the cell. This means it is May 29th. Distributing the scenes between the 13th and 29th, the 1st scene would be around the 16th. Fitz is watching a soccer game with a team in light blue and black, so it would make sense for this to be the Manchester City vs. West Bromwich Albion game on May 16, 2017. The 2nd scene, Fitz eating, by distribution would place on May 18th. The 3rd scene would be the 21st, and this is with a soccer game on in the background. This matches, as Fitz is a Manchester United fan, and they played Crystal Palace on May 21, 2017. The 4th scene, where he turns on his lamp, by distribution would place on May 24th, and the 5th, where he does crunches, then places on May 26th. for My Patsy](/wiki/AKA_Pray_for_My_Patsy), Frankie tells Jeri Hogarth on May 29, 2017 (see other references) that Shane Ryback was \"in here yesterday\", meaning it One People](/wiki/One_World,_One_People) [](#cite_ref-116)In [Spider-Man: No Way Home](/wiki/Spider-Man:_No_Way_Home), Peter Parker is shown to have received a science award at the \"Sophomore Level.\" [Spider-Man: Homecoming](/wiki/Spider-Man:_Homecoming)shows Parker's sophomore year to be the 2016-2017 school year, so Parker would have been presented this award at the end of the year, June 2017.

This means it is June 10th. Distributing the scenes between May 29th and June 10th, the scene would be around June 4th. Fitz is watching a soccer game, getting angry. No team of interest to Fitz played between May 29th and June 9th in the real world, but the Champions League final was on June 3, 2017. Whether he is simply passionate about the game, or Manchester United got to the Champions League final in the MCU, either way, June 3rd works the Bathtub, Monster in the Bed](/wiki/AKA_Shark_in_the_Bathtub,_Monster_in_the_Bed), Oscar Arocho says on May 23, 2017 (see other references), \"We have a custody hearing in 2 weeks.\" Exactly 2 weeks on would be Tuesday, June 6, 2017, but it could be more generally meaning \"Week commencing Monday, May 22, 2017 + 2 weeks = week commencing Monday, June 5, 2017\", so anywhere between Monday, June 5, 2017 and Sunday, June 11, 2017 - approximately Thursday, June 8, 2017. Putting more weight in the specific \"2 weeks\", it can be calculated that the hearing was approximately June 7, life in the time since [Jessica Jones](/wiki/Jessica_Jones_(TV_series)): [Season 3](/wiki/Jessica_Jones_(TV_series)/Season_Three). These pick up on the final day of [AKA Playland](/wiki/AKA_Playland), so June 7, 2017 (see other references), and cover the year through to April 30, 2018 (see [2018](/wiki/2018)references). By the time Walker is looking up heroic deeds in New York, there are three new articles referring to it being summer, and that Alisa Jones' death is still recent news. Allowing some time for Walker's training (though not too long given she is shown to improve fast), ensuring it is summer, but while keeping Alisa Jones' death recent, her searching can be approximated to June 27, 2017, with the scenes up to that point distributed between June 7th and June 27th. When Walker visits a costume store, the store has Halloween-based decoration. It is unclear whether the store is simply advertising that one of its usages is for Halloween costumes, or is decorated for Halloween. Given that the scene could feasibly be set around Halloween anyway, it may be taken to be Halloween season to comfortably fit in case the store is indeed dressed for that time. It could comfortably fit anywhere in the week preceding Halloween, so a rough estimate can be taken as October 28, 2017. The preceding scenes, with Walker's mother and the phone theft, therefore, are between June 27, 2017 and October 28, 2017. It is implied that it is still not too long after Alisa Jones' death, but is more importantly what inspires Walker to get a costume, so should be closer to October 28th. It may be approximated to October 17, 2017. When Walker wakes after spending the night with Adrian, the weather is said to be \"below freezing\" for the week and \"21\u00b0\" (Fahrenheit) at \"9:24AM\", which would suggest it is around January 15, 2018, with her sleeping with him on January 14th. This is where the news reports on Brandt being let go, so fits with Costa saying in [AKA I Have No Spleen](/wiki/AKA_I_Have_No_Spleen), in May 2018 (see 2018 references), that they have been \"trying to pin down [Brandt] for months\", referring either to this January 2018 event or some time before. Distributing the previous three sets of events between October 28, 2017 and January 14, 2018, Walker being served and visiting Hogarth would be around November 16-17, 2017 (assuming consecutive days), her mother visiting around December 7, 2017, and Reid Pearson around December 26, 2017 (shifting to December 27, 2017 to avoid the main Christmas period). Finally, there are two scenes before January 15, 2018 and April 27, 2018 (see 2018 references). If you were to distribute these, the first scene, of Walker and Grace, would be in February 2018. However, it is stated to be \"spring\". While some consider March 1st the start of spring, the first official day of spring in 2018 was March 20th, so this should ideally be no earlier than March 20, 2018. To be as close as possible to evenly spacing the two scenes (and fitting with the fact that Walker gives advice for starting afresh with spring, as if it were the start of spring), March 20, 2018 may be taken. This matches Walker saying in [AKA The Perfect Burger](/wiki/AKA_The_Perfect_Burger), on April 29, 2018, that she has been tracking Brandt \"for weeks\", referring to around this time. Approximating her email draft as halfway between March 20, 2018 and April 27, 2018, that scene may be dated to April 8, 2018. By April 27, 2018, the episode catches up with the events of AKA The Perfect Burger, so events do not need special dating. - [122.0](#cite_ref-R101_Prologue_June_2017_Placement_122-0) [122.1](#cite_ref-R101_Prologue_June_2017_Placement_122-1)In [Reunion](/wiki/Reunion_(Runaways)), a prologue shows Destiny Gonzalez being taken in by the Church of Gibborim, before cutting to \"six months later\", when the rest of the season begins on December 8, 2017. This therefore means the prologue is approximately Ten Rings](/wiki/Shang-Chi_and_the_Legend_of_the_Ten_Rings) [](#cite_ref-125)In [Shang-Chi and the Legend of the Ten Rings](/wiki/Shang-Chi_and_the_Legend_of_the_Ten_Rings), Shang-Chi is shown wearing a shirt which says \"SYLMAR EAGLES\" on the front and \"CLASS OF '17\" on the back. It can therefore be taken that he graduated from Sylmar Charter High School, which had their 2017 graduation ceremony on [June 9, 2017](https://www.dailynews.com/2017/06/13/sylmar-charter-high-school-students-parents-share-photos-from-class-of-2017-graduation-ceremony/). - [126.0](#cite_ref-AoS5_Fitz_June_10th-26th_126-0) [126.1](#cite_ref-AoS5_Fitz_June_10th-26th_126-1) [126.2](#cite_ref-AoS5_Fitz_June_10th-26th_126-2)In [Rewind](/wiki/Rewind_(Agents_of_S.H.I.E.L.D.)), Fitz is shown to have 28 monkey faces on his wall when he listens to soccer and looks at his wall, the timings from the night of May 12th, and works on a formula (these scenes are not separate, due to the same soccer game playing out across the shots). While 28 monkey faces would suggest it is the 28th day after May 12th, June 9th, Fitz is not shown actually drawing the 28th face, so it is possible that it is the 29th day, before he has drawn the 29th face. This allows the scene to be June 10, 2017, the day of the Scotland vs. England World Cup qualifier, which he would be interested in. 1 scene then transpires, before the scene where Fitz does push-ups and is estimated to have 45 monkeys on his wall (see other references), making it June 26th. The scene in between, where he eats and looks at Simmons' file, would place halfway between June 10th and 26th, on June 18th. time Fitz asks for his letter to be sent is reasoned as June 3, 2017 (see other references). By the time Lance Hunter arrives on November 25, 2017 (see other references), Fitz says, \"They printed my letters in the last six issues of Ballbaster Hooligan,\" meaning his letters were featured in the issues released in June through November inclusively. Considering the minimum total time needed for Fitz's letter to be analyzed, sent to the U.K., received, edited into the publication of that month's magazine, and then the magazine to be published, with him giving it over on June 3rd, the issue released in June cannot have been released any earlier than June 13th. Considering he has already received the issue released in November by November 25th, the earliest it could have been released to have made it to the U.S.A. by the 24th is November 21st. Considering a magazine for the following month is usually released in the final third of the month before, it can be taken that the fanzine would not have released much earlier than November 21st - perhaps November 20th, to be certain that it made it to Fitz by the 24th on government-priority shipping. This would mean that the fanzine is likely released on the penultimate Monday of each month, and Fitz receives each issue about 4 days later. In June 2017, this was Monday 19th, so he receives it on the 23rd. In July 2017, Monday 24th, so he receives it on the 28th. In August 2017, Monday 21st, so he receives it on the 25th. In September 2017, Monday 18th, so he receives it on the 22nd. In October 2017, Monday 23rd, so he receives it on the 27th. In November 2017, Monday 20th, so he receives it on the 24th. [](#cite_ref-HE104_129-0) [Hawkeye: 1.04: Partners, Am I Right?](/wiki/Partners,_Am_I_Right%3F) [](#cite_ref-130)In Barton says to Kazi Kazimierczak, \"Look, you've been working under William Lopez as a lieutenant for, what, for four years? And now under Maya for a few more years.\" This implies that Kazimierczak had been working under William Lopez for four years prior to his death on the reasoned date of June 22, 2021 (see [2021](/wiki/2021)references). This could refer to an exact four years, so June 22, 2017, or simply during the calendar year of 2017, so approximately July 2, 2017. A weighted calculation, placing greater weight on the more specific, places Kazimierczak joining the Tracksuit Mafia on where Fitz has 28 monkey faces on his wall (reasoned as June 10th), a scene transpires where Fitz eats and looks at Simmons' file. The next scene then shows him doing push-ups. This is followed by a scene where he scrunches up a piece of work, followed by another push-up scene. He then gets angry about a free kick, and then there is a final push-up scene, before the scene with his 49th monkey face, on June 30th. Last time the monkeys were shown, they were in rows of 4 (incomplete row), 7 | (line on the wall) 7, 7, 3 (incomplete row). In all 3 push-up scenes, it now appears that the 4th row above the line on the wall is 6 (incomplete row). This would suggest that it is 6, 7, 7, 7 | 7, 7, 3-7. It is unknown whether Fitz has added to that bottom row we previously saw incomplete or just left it as an incomplete row of 3. The scene after, with the 49th monkey face, shows that the bottom row has indeed been filled out, so he must have filled it at some point over this time. By distribution, we can approximate that ((1 - 0.5) \u00f7 3) \u00d7 4 = roughly 1 of the missing 4 has been filled out in the 1st scene, ((2 - 0.5) \u00f7 3) \u00d7 4 = 2 have been filled out in the 2nd, and ((3 - 0.5) \u00f7 3) \u00d7 4 = roughly 3 in the 3rd scene. This would mean there is approximately a total of 45, 46, and 47 monkeys respectively in the 3 push-up scenes, thus making them approximately June 26th, 27th, and 28th. There are very few soccer games on in late June, so it is hard to believe that there were games on consecutive days. Therefore, the game playing in the scene before the push-ups on the 27th and the game playing in the scene after the push-ups on the 27th has to be assumed to be the same game, with Fitz muting or turning it off in the middle for push-ups. Therefore, these scenes are either side of the push-ups on the 27th. There isn't an obvious match that it could be which he is watching, but it can be assumed that the soccer schedule between seasons in the MCU is not identical to the real world.

In [The Patriot](/wiki/The_Patriot), it is revealed that the government was in need of a serum to create a superpowered individual, specifically Jeffrey Mace, so they relied on an altered version of Calvin Zabo's Formula. The use of Calvin Zabo's Formula, which led Zabo to insanity, rather than the Super Soldier Serum implies that when Project Patriot was started on August 29, 2016 (see [2016](/wiki/2016)references), Nagel had not yet found the necessary compounds. Nagel goes on to say that he was unable to perfect his serum because he was a victim of Thanos' Snap on May 31, 2018 (see [2018](/wiki/2018)references). Using Project Patriot's beginning as the minimum and the Snap as the maximum, Nagel would have discovered the compounds on approximately July 15, 2017. - [139.0](#cite_ref-CD203_102_Days_Ago_139-0) [139.1](#cite_ref-CD203_102_Days_Ago_139-1)In [Shadow Selves](/wiki/Shadow_Selves), it is shown that visited Delgado for the second time \"102 days ago\" before October 30, 2017 (see other references), making it his 49th monkey face in his cell, meaning it is 49 days since he was incarcerated, making it June 30th. 5 scenes then transpire, before the 6th scene, where Fitz is shown receiving the latest issue of Ballbaster Hooligan, and then the 7th being Fitz's 197th monkey face, making it November 25th. Distributing between June 30th and November 25th would give the 6th scene as being roughly November 4th. Fitz receives Ballblaster Hooligan in October on the 27th and in November on the 24th (see other references). October 27th is the closer of the two to November 4th, so this is the date used - the fifth issue he has received, not the sixth - which matches with the fact that he appears to have approximately 4 other issues on his desk when he throws the new one. If the other 5 scenes before were then distributed evenly between June 30th and October 27th, it would give August 9th for the 2nd scene, which includes a soccer game. The closest game which Manchester United, Fitz's team, played, was on August 8th against Real Madrid, so this date can be used. Finally, the 1st scene is placed halfway between June 30th and August 8th, on July 20th, and the 3rd, 4th, and 5th scenes are then distributed between August 8th and October 27th, giving August 28th, September 17th, and October 7th.

While there is some evidence for 2016 and 2018, however, ultimately it can be placed as August-September 2017. Claire Temple is still studying Misty Knight's arm, and Misty Knight is not used to having no arm; not much has happened with Mariah Dillard and Shades since [You Know My Steez](/wiki/You_Know_My_Steez); Dillard speaks to Luke Cage in [Soul Brother #1](/wiki/Soul_Brother_1)as if she has not seen him since he was released from prison. These all suggest that it has not been long since [Luke Cage](/wiki/Luke_Cage_(TV_series)): [Season 1](/wiki/Luke_Cage_(TV_series)/Season_One)in December 2015 May 2016, so ideally August-September 2016. Plus, Foggy Nelson says the Destiny's Child bar mitzvah from May 2005 was \"a decade ago\", which would suggest 2016 ideally. However, SC6 is on TV, which started on February 6, 2017; \"alternative facts\" are referenced, a phrase that became popular after January 22, 2017; Bad and Boujee is referenced, released October 28, 2016; Amanda Nunes vs. Ronda Rousey has happened, making this later than December 31, 2016; Misty Knight's car, in the August-set portion of the season, has a \"9 18\" car registration sticker, making it at least September 2016; Cage has The Force by Don Winslow, only released on June 20, 2017; This Is Us is already well-known and has aired multiple episodes, making it at least October 2016; the \"bend the knee\" phrase from Game of Thrones is used, first mentioned in Season 7, Episode 3 on July 30, 2017; a car is shown during a gunfight Misty Knight engages in with an \"11 18\" registration sticker, meaning it is after November 2016; Sheldon's car has a \"3 19\" registration sticker, meaning it is after March 2017; D.W. Griffith says, \"Personally I haven't felt this weird since November 9th,\" meaning it is after the November 9, 2016 election; the Marvel Netflix seasons have always been set after each previous one, implying it should be after [Jessica Jones](/wiki/Jessica_Jones_(TV_series)): [Season 2](/wiki/Jessica_Jones_(TV_series)/Season_Two), so after June 2017; [Emma Lahana says that Cloak & Dagger: Season 1 is just after O'Reilly has moved from New York to New Orleans](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y9d8dOY7e58&t=1382s), and it is set in February 2017, so she moved in early 2017, and she is referred to as being already in New Orleans. These all prove that the season is set in at least August-September 2017, not 2016. All the things suggesting 2016 also have leniency. There is some evidence for 2018. When Mariah Dillard checks her bank account, it says, \"Next Statement Sept 1, 2018\". Statements are usually monthly, suggesting it is currently August 2018. Shades also has a \"6 20\" registration sticker, which would make it at least June 2018. However, SC6 is on TV, which ended on February 2, 2018 (although that was likely something that could not have been predicted during filming, so it is not necessarily the intention that this evidence would place it before February 2, 2018); Shades' car has a \"1 18\" registration making it no later than January 2018; Jeph Loeb stated about the Marvel Television seasons released between April 27, 2018 and April 26, 2019, [\"For the most part our stories will take place BEFORE Thanos clicked his fingers,\"](https://www.reddit.com/r/marvelstudios/comments/8pbxyk/im_jeph_loeb_head_of_marvel_tv_ama/e0a5ju5/)and later made more clear, [\"The short answer is that the stories that you're seeing, unless otherwise noted, all happen before [...] \"the Thanos Snap\". And we'll continue to be in that place until we find out what happens in Avengers 4,\"](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9UqrlizXWIM&t=2015s)also specifying, [\"Certainly Luke Cage takes place before the infamous snap\"](https://www.bustle.com/p/why-infinity-war-hasnt-changed-any-marvel-netflix-shows-yet-according-to-jeph-loeb-9555046), all placing the season prior to Avengers: Infinity War in Spring/early Summer 2018; the Marvel Netflix seasons have always been set after each previous one, implying it should be before [Iron Fist](/wiki/Iron_Fist_(TV_series)): [Season 2](/wiki/Iron_Fist_(TV_series)/Season_Two), so before October 2017; Matt Murdock is referred to as being dead, meaning it must be before he is revealed to be alive, which is also October 2017. These all prove that the season is set no later than August-September 2017, not 2018. Overall, 2017 works best. The Yankees are also playing a doubleheader 5 days before the West Indian Parade, which happened in 2017 - August 30th - and not in 2016 or 2018. As well as this, D.W. Griffith's line, \"Personally I haven't felt this weird since November 9th,\" implies specifically that the November 9, 2016 election is the last \"November 9th\", making on October 8, 2017 (see other references), Walker says she has been tracking Danny Rand for \"60 days\", so since August 9, 2017. - [152.0](#cite_ref-LC201_Bulletin_152-0) [152.1](#cite_ref-LC201_Bulletin_152-1)In [Soul Brother #1](/wiki/Soul_Brother_1), on August 18, 2017 (see other references), recent New York Bulletin front pages are shown with the headlines Lordy! and Protest Turned Brofest. Lordy! is on top of the pile, so can be assumed to be that day's paper, and Protest Turned Brofest is seemingly the one underneath, so can be assumed as the paper from the day before. [](#cite_ref-153)In the [Doctor Strange](/wiki/Doctor_Strange_(film))post-credits scene, when Mordo visits Pangborn, he says, \"I've been away for many months now.\" Mordo left the Masters of the Mystic Arts the morning of January 19, 2017 (see other references). Therefore, it has been absolute minimum 3 months, which is earliest April 1st, minimum possible 4 months, which is earliest May 1st, and minimum realistic 5 months, which is earliest June 1st. Overall, by weighted average, the earliest it can be is May 14th. It has been maximum realistic 9 months, which is latest just under 9.5 months, November 2nd, maximum possible 10 months, which is latest just under 10.5 months, December 3rd, and absolute latest the end of the 11th month after, December 31st. Overall, by weighted average, the latest it can be is November 20th. So overall, the middle of the average earliest and average latest gives August 17, 2017, as the approximate date. For more details on the calculation, see [here](/wiki/Thread:224967#135). [](#cite_ref-154)last week with a busted tail light and a gram of weed. it is said on September 3, 2017 (see other references) that the system was installed \"2 weeks ago\". This would suggest approximately August 20, 2017. However, it may more roughly just mean \"this week is the week of September 3-9, 2017, 2 weeks ago was the week of August 20-26, 2017\", so any time in that week (using midweek as an approximation). Putting more weight in the specific date than just the week, a weighted calculation gives roughly August 21, 2017 for when they installed the November 1, 2017 (see other references), \"I've been watching you for weeks now,\" meaning the Bowens' meetings began \"weeks\" ago. At the earliest, this would be around early-to-mid-August 2017. Given Tyrone Johnson refers in October 2017 (see other references), in [Restless Energy](/wiki/Restless_Energy), to a meeting \"last month\", the latest is late September 2017. Overall, the first meeting can be approximated to early September 2017. In Restless Energy, Tandy and Melissa Bowen's therapy group meetings are implied to be weekly (Dewan says \"See you next week\") and one is strongly implied to be the day after Tandy vandalizes Jeremy's house, which is said to be \"Friday\". So, the meetings are likely held weekly, on Saturdays. The first meeting can therefore be approximated to Saturday, September Mindstorm](/wiki/Morning_of_the_Mindstorm), on the evening of October 20, 2017 (see other references), Bethany says she has been pregnant for \"6 weeks, 3 days, and 14 hours\", so since 2017. [](#cite_ref-166) [](#cite_ref-167)In [The Fury of Iron Fist](/wiki/The_Fury_of_Iron_Fist), it is said on the morning of October 3, 2017 (see other references) that Frank Choi's furniture store has been closed for \"a few weeks\". Taking \"few\" to mean approximately 3-4, closing the store can be taken to be approximately 3\u00bd weeks earlier, so around September 8, 2017 evening. [](#cite_ref-168)In [Restless Energy](/wiki/Restless_Energy), on October 20, 2017 (see other references), Tyrone Johnson says he saw Bowen cutting an axle after one of her meetings \"last month\". This technically simply refers to September 2017 (which can be approximated with mid-September), though could be taken to simply be a quick way of saying \"a month ago\", so around September 20, 2017. Putting more weight on the true meaning, a weighted calculation would suggest around September 17, 2017. In Restless Energy, Tandy and Melissa Bowen's therapy group meetings are implied to be weekly (Dewan says \"See you next week\") and one is strongly implied to be the day after Tandy vandalizes Jeremy's house, which is said to be \"Friday\". So, the meetings are likely held weekly, on Saturdays. The closest Saturday to September 17, 2017 is Saturday, September 16, 2017, so the event can be approximated Ellison says on October 23, 2017 (see other references) that he has not had a home-cooked meal in \"about a month\". This could refer to a near-exact month (around September 23, 2017) or a more general \"October 2017 - September 2017 = 1 months\" (so approximating with mid-September, September 15/16, 2017). Putting more weight on the more specific, a weighted calculation gives the buy as approximately September 21, 2017. [](#cite_ref-171)In [The Fury of Iron Fist](/wiki/The_Fury_of_Iron_Fist), Rand says on Tuesday, October 3, 2017 (see other references) that he put one of Colleen Wing's dresses in the dryer \"last week\". The week prior would have been Sunday, September 24, 2017-Saturday, September 30, 2017, so using the mid-point as an approximation, it can be taken that he put the dress in the dryer around Wednesday, September 27, 2017. [](#cite_ref-172)In [The City's Not for Burning](/wiki/The_City%27s_Not_for_Burning), Ward Meachum says to Joy on Wednesday, October 4, 2017 (see other references), \"My new assistant's been badgering your new assistant for a week.\" 1 week prior would have been Wednesday, September evidence [Daredevil](/wiki/Daredevil_(TV_series)): [Season 3](/wiki/Daredevil_(TV_series)/Season_Three)places its events in 2017. Iron Fist: Season 2 takes place after the events of [Luke Cage](/wiki/Luke_Cage_(TV_series)): [Season 2](/wiki/Luke_Cage_(TV_series)/Season_Two), as is evidenced by Rand being in New York City in [The Main Ingredient](/wiki/The_Main_Ingredient)but leaving the country after [A Duel of Iron](/wiki/A_Duel_of_Iron), Hai-Qing Yang appearing late in Luke Cage: Season 2 and being killed early in Iron Fist: Season 2, and Misty Knight having her bionic arm given during Luke Cage: Season 2, as well as referring to her offer of a promotion from that season. Luke Cage: Season 2 takes place firmly in August-September 2017 (see other references), making this no earlier than September 2017. In [War Without End](/wiki/War_Without_End), the \"spring fair\" is being planned in Chinatown - the fair for Chinese New Year, thus meaning it is coming up, making it the run-up to February 16, 2018. This is supported by Colleen Wing, in [The Fury of Iron Fist](/wiki/The_Fury_of_Iron_Fist), offering to give Lana Tsai \"kids' winter stuff\", implying it is winter, as well as there being cold weather throughout the season. It is also supported by a laptop in [The City's Not for Burning](/wiki/The_City%27s_Not_for_Burning)with a [January 2018 date](/wiki/File:20180912_160414_(2).jpg). The laptop also shows that it is 18:58 and dark outside, putting it roughly between October 5, 2017 and March 10, 2018 regardless of the January date. And, in [Target: Iron Fist](/wiki/Target:_Iron_Fist), Misty Knight says, \"This is probably not next year's Christmas card,\" implying that Christmas has been fairly recently, if next Christmas is still being considered \"next year's\" (even though it would be \"this year\"), being in the wake of the last Christmas. The main events of Daredevil: Season 3 are said to be \"months\" since the events of [The Defenders](/wiki/The_Defenders): [Season 1](/wiki/The_Defenders/Season_One), firmly in Spring 2016 (see [2016](/wiki/2016)references). The official synopsis says, \"Missing for months, Matt Murdock (Charlie Cox) reemerges broken man.\" In [No Good Deed](/wiki/No_Good_Deed), Murdock says, \"I've had a rough couple of months, Foggy. Questioning a lot of... the point of it all.\" This would imply merely 2 months since he woke, \"weeks\" after the main events of [The Defenders](/wiki/The_Defenders_(episode)), but this is impossible. It can either be taken that Murdock is using \"couple\" the informal way to mean \"few\", or just that only in the last couple of months of his hiding has he started questioning things, though this would not have been long after he recovered. So, either way, this still implies not long since The Defenders. Then, in [The Perfect Game](/wiki/The_Perfect_Game), Karen Page is asked, \"When's the last time you heard from Matt Murdock?\", and replies, \"Um... months,\" though it can be taken that she is trying to downplay the length of time, without actually lying. It is also generally strongly implied that not much time passes following The Defenders before the main events of the season. In [Reunion](/wiki/Reunion_(Daredevil)), it is said that Fisk was wrongly convicted \"2 years\" ago, and in [One Last Shot](/wiki/One_Last_Shot)it is said Vanessa Marianna was protected for \"2 years\". With Fitz's arrest and Marianna going into hiding both being February 2015 (see [2015](/wiki/2015)references), this would suggest it is now early 2017. It is also clearly around winter-time, so it would seem on this evidence alone that it is early 2017, about 8 months after The Defenders: Season 1. However, these are not mutually compatible, as the main events of Iron Fist: Season 2 take place before the main events of Daredevil: Season 3, with references in [This Deadly Secret](/wiki/This_Deadly_Secret)and [Citadel on the Edge of Vengeance](/wiki/Citadel_on_the_Edge_of_Vengeance)to Danny Rand carrying out Matt Murdock's mission (given to him in The Defenders when Murdock thought he was going to die and wanted Rand to fight in his place), implying Murdock is still thought deceased. The official synopsis for Iron Fist: Season 2 says, [\"This season, Danny has promised that with Matt Murdock gone, he will step up and protect his city,\"](https://www.comicbookmovie.com/tv/marvel/iron_fist/iron-fist-season-2-synopsis-reveals-that-danny-rand-is-stepping-up-to-take-daredevils-place-a162297)confirming Murdock is still thought dead. All of Iron Fist: Season 2, except for its epilogue, should therefore take place before the reappearance of \"Daredevil\" during the attack on the New York Bulletin Building in [The Devil You Know](/wiki/The_Devil_You_Know), followed shortly by Murdock's public reappearance. Some compromise has to be made wherein Daredevil: Season 3 is later than early 2017, and Iron Fist: Season 2 is earlier than early 2018. Iron Fist: Season 2 can be dragged earlier, but at the absolute earliest it is late 2017, with the spring fair committee taken to be planning far ahead of time - a few months. This is a stretch, but again, necessary to make it work. And there are a few things that work better with Iron Fist: Season 2 being late 2017: in The Fury of Iron Fist, Rand says he \"missed the last 15 years of culture\", having been missing for almost 15 years and now catching up, and while not particularly including the time since he returned, it nonetheless implies it is still close to 15 years since he went missing, and 2017 is 16 years rather than 2018 being 17; in The Fury of Iron Fist and This Deadly Secret, it is said that it is \"months\" since Joy and Ward Meachum last spoke, which is implied to be referring if not to [Season 1](/wiki/Iron_Fist_(TV_series)/Season_One)then to a time shortly after then, so the shorter the span between Season 1 and 2 the better; Misty Knight is still considering the captain offer, has taken leave to ponder it, and is implied to have not seen Luke Cage since [They Reminisce Over You (T.R.O.Y.)](/wiki/They_Reminisce_Over_You_(T.R.O.Y.)), which works much better as a month or so after the end of Luke Cage: Season 2 in September 2017 than a few months later; in [Morning of the Mindstorm](/wiki/Morning_of_the_Mindstorm)it is said that Rand has been \"all over Chinatown for months\", which is implied to be referring if not to The Defenders: Season 1 then to a time shortly after then, so the shorter the span between then and this season the better; the epilogue of A Duel of Iron \"months later\" fits more comfortably before [Avengers: Infinity War](/wiki/Avengers:_Infinity_War)in May 2018 if A Duel of Iron is late 2017 than early 2018, and it should be before Avengers: Infinity War ( [1](https://twitter.com/MRavenMetzner/status/1040696708131254272), [2](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9UqrlizXWIM&t=2015s)). Daredevil: Season 3 can be pushed to late 2017, at the latest. This causes problems in relation to The Defenders: Season 1, as it makes it roughly 17 months since then, when it is implied to be only a few months. It somewhat works as \"months\", being only over a year, not yet a year-and-a-half or 2 years, but it is a big stretch. You certainly cannot push it further, as this is the latest it can be while still being considered \"2 years\" since early 2015, as well as the absolute most you can stretch the gap since The Defenders: Season 1. But some evidence does in fact support late 2017: this works better with the line in The Perfect Game from Benjamin Donovan, \"an early and very white Christmas\"; the season has to be after Luke Cage: Season 2 (finishing September 2017) as, not only is it after Iron Fist: Season 2 which is after Luke Cage; Season 2, but Karen Page is referenced in [The Creator](/wiki/The_Creator)as still working as a reporter, when she loses that job and begins working for Nelson, Murdock and Page in Daredevil: Season 3; most importantly, the DA election occurred in New York City in the real world in late 2017. With Daredevil: Season 3 pushed forward to its absolute limit and Iron Fist: Season 2 pulled back to its absolute limit, they can just about be pulled to meet at late 2017. There is some evidence for it being very late 2017: heavy snow is shown during Daredevil: Season 3, which works significantly better are November-December than October-November, and the later in 2017, the better for Iron Fist: Season 2 as it is closer to early 2018. However, the majority of the evidence, with a late 2017 placement, would point to October-November 2017: in [Aftermath](/wiki/Aftermath), is it shown to be 57\u00b0F at 18:30 in New York City, which would suggest ideally approximately late October (or mid-to-late April); Iron Fist: Season 2 is seemingly not long after Knight's job offer in Luke Cage: Season 2, with Knight still considering the captain job offer; it is slightly closer to The Defenders: Season 1 (17 months rather than 18/19 - keeping it under a year-and-a-half), so just slightly more plausible for the mentions of \"months\"; it is also slightly closer to Iron Fist: Season 1, again fitting slightly better with the implications of \"months\"; it is slightly more plausible as \"2 years\" since early 2015; it makes it under 16 years since Danny Rand's plane crash when he says he missed \"the last 15 years of culture\"; most importantly, it fits with the real New York City DA election - it would be odd to align with late 2017 but not quite line up with a big timeline indicator (especially since They Reminisce Over You (T.R.O.Y.) establishes at least some election dates as the same in the MCU), and the election's inclusion can be taken as an indication that it was not meant to be right at the end of the year, despite the snow. So, the two seasons should be in the lead-up to the November 7, 2017 election, as late as possible. The final scenes of Daredevil: Season 3, still before the election, are a Friday (working forward from Poindexter saying in No Good Deed that it is Tuesday). As late as possible makes it Friday, November 3, 2017. Working back, this puts the attack on the New York Bulletin building on October 27, 2017. The seasons should overlap as much as possible, to allow Iron Fist: Season 2 to be as late (close to its ideal early 2018) as possible. So, Rand leaving in the plane should be as late as possible while still before the attack on the New York Bulletin. The day of Rand leaving is a Wednesday, Thursday, or Friday, based on dialogue in the season. Taking it to be Friday (the exact same day as the attack on the New York Bulletin), however, also allows the ambush on Fisk's convoy to fall comfortably in the gap between Morning of the Mindstorm and Citadel on the Edge of Vengeance in Iron Fist: Season 2, thus meaning that this major event, worthy of citywide news, not being addressed during Iron Fist: Season 2 is not a problem. So, the end of the main events of Iron Fist: Season 2 can be taken to be Friday, October 27, 2017. Working back from there, Iron Fist: Season 2 spans 18 days at an absolute minimum, meaning the latest it can start is Monday, October 9, 2017. However, in The Fury of Iron Fist, Rand jokes that their date nights should become a regular occurrence, \"every Tuesday\", implying it is currently Tuesday. The latest Tuesday it can be, therefore, is Tuesday, October 3, 2017, with the season spanning 24 days (other than the epilogue). This is a more suitable length, considering the battle at Golden Tigers' Hideout is referred to in Morning of the Mindstorm as \"a few weeks ago\" (this pushes it to 2 weeks prior) as well as Rand's recovery from injury - said to be incredibly fast, but still spanning some time - now taking 15 days, while taking into consideration that it is not possible to stretch the season a further week, to start on September 26, 2017, since the passage of time in the season does not fit with much more than the approximate 24 days. Finally, when aligned side-by-side, this gives: - October 3-20, 2017: The Fury of Iron Fist-Morning of the Mindstorm. - October 22-23, 2017: Resurrection ending-No Good Deed opening. - October 24, 2017: Citadel on the Edge of Vengeance opening/No Good Deed. - October 25, 2017: Citadel on the Edge of Vengeance-War Without End opening/ [Blindsided](/wiki/Blindsided). - October 26, 2017: War Without End-A Duel of Iron opening/The Perfect Game. - October 27, 2017: A Duel of Iron/The Devil You Know-Aftermath opening. - main events of [Cloak & Dagger](/wiki/Cloak_%26_Dagger): [Season 2](/wiki/Cloak_%26_Dagger/Season_Two), is dated to Friday, October 28, 2017 (see other references). In Restless Energy, Tandy and Melissa Bowen's therapy group meetings are implied to be weekly (Lia says \"See you next week\") and one is strongly implied to be the day after Tandy vandalizes Jeremy's house, which is said to be \"Friday\". So, the meetings are likely held weekly, on Saturdays. This makes Tandy's vandalism the previous Friday, Friday, October 21, 2017, and the meeting following it Saturday, October 22, 2017. Furthermore, it would make the previous meeting in the episode Friday, October 14, 2017. The beginning of the episode is implied to be shortly before this. However, Friday, October 13, 2017 does not make absolute sense, as Tandy has ballet, and Tandy is lying to her mother later in the episode when she says she has an extra ballet class on a \"Friday\". So, her ballet classes should not be Fridays, implying the beginning of the episode should in fact be another day earlier, dating it to Thursday, October 12, 2017. The events of Restless Energy therefore span October 12-28, 2017. [](#cite_ref-SHAaL103_181-0) [She-Hulk: Attorney at Blonsky](/wiki/The_People_vs._Emil_Blonsky) - [182.0](#cite_ref-DD301_Nadeem_Last_Week_182-0) [182.1](#cite_ref-DD301_Nadeem_Last_Week_182-1)In [Resurrection](/wiki/Resurrection_(Daredevil)), it is said on Sunday, October 22, 2017 (see other references) that Seema Nadeem paid her and Ray's red Visa \"last week\", and that one of their friend Nadia's literacy tutors quit \"last week\". This would refer to the week of Sunday, October 15, 2017-Saturday, October 21, 2017, so can be approximated with Wednesday, October 18, 2017. However, it may also be used more loosely to refer to \"about a week ago\", so around October 15, 2017. Putting more weight in the exact meaning, a weighted calculation gives approximately October 17, 2017. [](#cite_ref-183)In [No Good Deed](/wiki/No_Good_Deed), Karen Page says, \"A week ago, he tells his family that he regrets the sale and announces his intention to buy the hotel back,\" and Ellison responds, \"And 2 days later, Kazemi gets attacked.\" This implies he was attacked 5 days ago, with Ellison knowing that the attack was 2 days after the event she was referring to just from it being said to be \"a week ago\". However, the attack is definitively only 2 days prior to the discussion, so it must be taken that Ellison in fact knows when Kazemi made this statement, to then know that it was 2 days before the attack - and Page is rounding up to \"a week\" from just 4 days. [](#cite_ref-184)In [Two Player](/wiki/Two_Player), on November 3, 2017 (see other references), Tyrone Johnson and Solomon look at an article by Karen Page. During this part of the timeline, Page is embroiled in the events of [Daredevil](/wiki/Daredevil_(TV_series)): [Season 3](/wiki/Daredevil_(TV_series)/Season_Three). So, assuming the article is as recent as possible before she is caught up in those events, it can be approximated to October Fitz has written a letter to the editor of the fictional fanzine Ballblaster Hooligan, for Liverpool fans, in which he refers to the manager having \"arrived 3 years ago\". In the real world, J\u00fcrgen Klopp took over in October 2015, which would suggest that this is now 2018. However, there is a wealth of evidence placing the end of Season 4 in May 2017, and this is less than 6 months (later in the episode it is said to have been 6 months) after. The episode Rewind itself confirms that the episode is set in 2017, cutting to \"2091\", \"74 years later\". It can be assumed that either they are referring to it being the 3rd soccer season since he took over or simply that the Liverpool managers were different/at different times in as \"8 months\" ago. In [Restless Energy](/wiki/Restless_Energy), it is established that Tandy and Melissa Bowen's therapy meetings with Lia Dewan are likely weekly (Dewan says \"See you next week\") and one is strongly implied to be the day after Tandy vandalizes Jeremy's house, which is said to be \"Friday\". So, the meetings are likely held weekly, on Saturdays. In [Shadow Selves](/wiki/Shadow_Selves), the day after a meeting, so likely a Sunday, it is shown that \"242 days ago\", Mayhem crawled out of the lake - the final scene from [Colony Collapse](/wiki/Colony_Collapse). The events of Colony Collapse otherwise end on March 1, 2017 (see other references), and this scene is implied to be shortly after this. Given that 242 days after March 1, 2017 is a Sunday (October 29, 2017), it can simply be taken that the Mayhem scene was the night of March 1, 2017, and the present events of Shadow Selves begin on Sunday, October 29, 2017. This then places the main events of the season, from the end of Episode 1 - Restless Energy to before the epilogue of Episode 10 - [Level Up](/wiki/Level_Up), from October 28, 2017 to November 4, 2017, aligning with it being 8 months since the climax of Season 1, dated to February 28, 2017 (see other references). It is said three times in Season 2 that Season 1 was \"last year\", but these are mistakes, given Season 1 explicitly ended at Mardi Gras (and for other reasons is also firmly February-March 2017, see other references) and it is explicitly 8 months/242 days on. [](#cite_ref-197) [Marvel Television Live Auction Lot #371: von Strucker says to Dr. Levi Van Kempen on Saturday, December 16, 2017 (see other references), \"April, your daughter. Just turned 3 [...] 6 weeks ago, during our Tuesday session [...] your wife called [...] April had a fever, 103.2. All those kids at the parties, a lot of germs.\" This would have occurred on Tuesday, October 31, 2017, and the implication is that this would be the day after April's party, making that October Comforts of Home](/wiki/All_the_Comforts_of_Home), it is said in the morning of December 4, 2017 (see other references) that the beam \"showed up a few weeks ago\". This would suggest approximately 3\u00bd weeks, placing its initiation around the evening of November 9, 2017. [](#cite_ref-210) [Agents of S.H.I.E.L.D.: Talbot are shown to be \"6 months ago\" before May 18, 2018, so the flashbacks are reasoned to be around November 17th-18th, placement of [Thor: Ragnarok](/wiki/Thor:_Ragnarok)suggests it is set roughly in real time, [Kevin Feige specifically said, \"And I think there's a presumption, \"Well if the movie came out in November 2017, it must take place in November 2017\" - which is not the case.\"](https://www.cinemablend.com/news/1712910/kevin-feige-finally-addressed-the-spider-man-homecoming-timeline-controversy)Therefore, the placement must come purely from the evidence presented, uninfluenced by real time. In [Thor: Ragnarok](/wiki/Thor:_Ragnarok), Thor says, \"Sokovia, Ultron, that was 2 years ago.\" Banner asks, \"I've been Hulk for 2 years?\", and he replies, \"I'm afraid so.\" Then, later, Banner mentions (from Thor's information) that he was \"trapped for 2 years inside of a monster.\" These refer to it being 2 years since the Battle of Sokovia, dated to May 6, 2015. It has been stated events of the film pick up 2 years after the climax or ending of [Avengers: Age of Ultron](/wiki/Avengers:_Age_of_Ultron), in May-June 2015. [Tom Hiddleston also said, \"It's been 4 years since Thor: The Dark World, and Loki is pretending to be Odin.\"](https://www.cnet.com/news/comic-con-2017-new-thor-ragnarok-trailer-and-panel-marvel-hulk/)This would place the film 4 years after the end of [Thor: The Dark World](/wiki/Thor:_The_Dark_World)in November 2013. Overall, the maths weighing up this evidence places the film around July 2017, a little over 2 years after Avengers: Age of Ultron, nearly 4 years after Thor: The Dark World. However, [Avengers: Infinity War](/wiki/Avengers:_Infinity_War)places itself firmly in May 2018, by all the evidence given for its placement by the film itself and [Agents of S.H.I.E.L.D.](/wiki/Agents_of_S.H.I.E.L.D.). This would suggest around 8 months between the films, but the films seem very much to take place only a few months apart, due to implications from the dialogue in the Thor: Ragnarok credits scene, the identical state of the Asgardians, and the fact the characters are physically no different (hair, beards, outfits, etc.). Overall, the math places Thor: Ragnarok as occurring around mid-to-late November 2017, 6 months before Avengers: Infinity War. The specifics of the math can that when Hunter visits Fitz in prison, he has just drawn his 197th monkey face on the wall of his cell, making it the 197th morning after May 12, 2017, which is November 25, 2017. Therefore, the main events of Rewind take place November of Home](/wiki/All_the_Comforts_of_Home), Hale says on December 4, 2017 that Ruby \"skipped class yesterday\", making after the agents return from 2091, the date is shown on Yo-Yo Rodriguez's medical monitor to be \"12-06-2017\" - December 6, 2017, meaning they return on December 4, 2017. This matches with: [All the Comforts of Home](/wiki/All_the_Comforts_of_Home)being soon after the main events of Rewind on November 25-26, 2017, 197 days (as given by the number of monkey faces Fitz has drawn on his cell wall) after Fitz was incarcerated on May 12, 2017 and the day after. - In All the Comforts of Home, the events of Thor: Ragnarok are referenced as being recent, with Thor: Ragnarok taking place around November 2017. - In The Real Deal, Hale says, \"This is the first time Ms. Johnson's been sighted in months,\" suggesting it is still 2017 and not yet the new year and working well as 7 months since their disappearance in May 2017. - A couple of weeks later, in [Principia](/wiki/Principia_(episode)), Coulson jokes with Fitz asking if he comes bearing \"tidings of comfort and joy\", suggesting it is Christmas time. - A couple of weeks later, in Principia, a \"12-17-2017\" date is shown on poster is shown on Thursday, December 7, 2017 (see other references) that auditions for The Pirates of Penzance are \"this week\", meaning they were between Monday, December 4, 2017 and Friday, December 8, 2017, so can be approximated to Wednesday jumps back to 2017, Chase Stein says, \"He's gone back to the day before we discovered our parents in the basement,\" and the 2017 Molly Hernandez says, \"I've got dance class audition tomorrow.\" With the day of the audition and them discover their parents being December 8, 2017 (see other references), this must be December shown that the last time Amy logged in to play Star Wars: Battlefront was \"2 years ago\". With PlayStation time stamps rounding down, this means it has been anywhere between 2.00 and 2.99 years. With the game released on November 16, 2015, this means that at the very earliest, it is now late November 2017. In [Fifteen](/wiki/Fifteen), it is shown that in Geoffrey Wilder's drawer, he has what appears to be a newly bought 2018 planner. It does not look used, and is being kept in a drawer of miscellaneous items - the drawer being mainly intended for accessing his secret gun, not for important items. It can be taken, therefore, that it is roughly late 2017, but perhaps 2018. In [Refraction](/wiki/Refraction), in a flashback to \"25 years ago\", students are shown saying \"Dude, have you seen Reservoir Dogs yet?\" \"Oh, my God, it was so good.\" The implication of this is that the film has just come out, which was in October 1992, suggesting that present day is late 2017. Chase also says in [Rewind](/wiki/Rewind_(Runaways))that \"in another year [he'll] be off to college\", suggesting that it is late in the year, around the time college starts/a year before next year's college starts, and in Refraction, they say that they will have \"a hell of a personal essay for [their] college applications,\" implying that the applications are not yet finished, so it is not as late as January yet. In Rewind, Frank looks at Leslie's laptop calendar, and it says that the date is Friday 8th. It also shows that the month before was 31 days long and that this month is also 31 days long. While this would make it August (which it cannot be, since August is not during school term) or January, after January 2016, which is far too early, the next time that all 3 criteria are satisfied is January 2021, which is far too late. The calendar is not a reliable source, however, as it shows that the month ends with \"26, 27, 28, 29, 29, 30, 31\" and the next month begins with \"1, 2, 3, 4, 29\". However, after July 2016, which is too early, the months that have Friday 8ths are September 2017, December 2017, June 2018, and February 2019. In [Doomsday](/wiki/Doomsday), it is then shown that Atlas Academy is hosting the \"non-holiday-specific seasonal dance\", which implies it is December. Ultimately, it can be taken that [Runaways](/wiki/Runaways_(TV_series)): Season 1 occurs in December 2017. This is 25 years since late 1992, 2 years and a few days since Amy last played Star Wars: Battlefront on her day of death in early December 2015 (a couple of weeks after the game was released), about the time when Geoffrey would have bought a 2018 planner but not have used it yet, just under a year until college, a bit before college application deadlines, a month where there is indeed a Friday 8th, the time when a \"non-holiday-specific seasonal dance\" would be held, and also the real time date at the middle of the season's run (from November 2017 to January 2018). Runaways: Season 1 therefore begins on Friday, December 8, 2017, with the events of [Destiny](/wiki/Destiny)on Saturday, December 9th, Fifteen beginning that night and then going to Monday, December 11th, when [Kingdom](/wiki/Kingdom)also takes place. At the end of Kingdom, Leslie says that the gala is in a few days, and [Metamorphosis](/wiki/Metamorphosis)appears to be at the weekend, but when Metamorphosis picks up, characters act like it has been only a day or two, so it is as soon as possible after: Saturday, December 16th. Refraction and [Tsunami](/wiki/Tsunami)are as soon as possible after again, and are confirmed by Doomsday to be on Thursday: Thursday, December 21st, with Doomsday the next day on Friday (the signs say \"Friday 7-11 PM\"), December 22nd, the last day of term, and finally [Hostile](/wiki/Hostile)taking the season to the morning of Sunday, December 24th. Victor says in Refraction, \"On Monday, you are gonna make a public apology to my son and reinstate him to the lacrosse team,\" implying that it should be the week before, as the Monday after December 18th is December 25th, when there is no school. This is overruled, however, by Jonah saying in Doomsday, \"[Your children have] been lying to you for weeks,\" and, \"They've been conspiring against you for weeks,\" and Alex saying in the same episode, \"Look, I know that it's been a shitty couple of weeks.\" This means it is at least 2 weeks after Friday 8th, so the earliest it can be is Friday 22nd rather than Friday 15th. [](#cite_ref-227)In [A Duel of Iron](/wiki/A_Duel_of_Iron), on April 15, 2018 (see [2018](/wiki/2018)references) at 15:00 Eastern U.S. time (April 16, 2018 04:00 Hokkaido Japan), Ward Meachum refers to following the lead on Orson Randall \"from Hong Kong to Kuala Lumpur\", then \"Jakarta\". These events are therefore between the evening of October 27, 2017 (see other references) and April 15, 2018 15:00. Approximating by equally distributing them at \u00bc, \u00bd, and \u00be through that period, Hong Kong can be estimated to December 9, 2017, Kuala Lumpur to January 20, 2018, and Jakarta to March 4, 2018. several references throughout the episode that make it clear that it takes place over 1 day, and that it is the day after [Reunion](/wiki/Reunion)and [Rewind](/wiki/Rewind_(Runaways)). Leslie Dean says, \"It was so great seeing all you kids together again last night,\" Stacey Yorkes says, \"The nightmares I had after last night, Dale!\", Molly Hernandez says, \"Um, last night in your house... I went some place I shouldn't have,\" Robert Minoru says, \"I mean, never mind last night,\" and when Karolina Dean asks if Vaughn Kaye has seen Destiny Gonzalez, he says, \"Not since yesterday afternoon.\" With Reunion and Rewind being Friday, December 8, 2017 (see other references), this means Destiny is set on Saturday, December 9, 2017. - [229.0](#cite_ref-R104_Opening_Placement_229-0) [229.1](#cite_ref-R104_Opening_Placement_229-1)In the opening of [Fifteen](/wiki/Fifteen), the group call Nico Minoru to tell her the news about Destiny Gonzalez, and Gert Yorkes asks, \"Have you been under a rock all night?\" This means it is still the same day as the events of [Destiny](/wiki/Destiny), Saturday, December 9, 2017, despite the rest of Fifteen taking place on Monday, December 11, 2017 (see other references). There is, therefore, a jump of a day-and-a-half between Alex Wilder finding his father's gun and Victor Stein driving a kidnapped girl to be the next sacrifice. finds his father's gun on the evening of Saturday, December 9, 2017, there is a jump of roughly a day-and-a-half to Monday, December 11, 2017. This is evident because the events of the rest of the episode take place on a school day, so it cannot simply be the next day, despite that being the implication. It has to be at least Monday. This is supported by the fact that when Chase Stein encounters his lacrosse teammates for the first time since the party, they say, \"All weekend, no apology?\" This heavily suggests it is Monday, with it being their first encounter since Friday and it being just after \"all weekend\". Frank Dean also says to Leslie, \"I haven't seen you in days.\" The last time he saw her was Friday, so this works well as Monday, 3 days later, and matches with what Leslie says, \"That's what I've been doing in there, praying for you over the last 2 days.\" She is claiming to have been praying since over a day as Johnson and Bowen prepare to leave New Orleans, then depart on a bus together. During the montage, a letter from Johnson to Delgado says, \"Over the past nine months I have had a lot of time to think on the lessons you taught me,\" as he goes on to talk about staying at St. Theresa's Church. With him moving into the church on March 1, 2017 (see other references), this would suggest the letter was written around early December 2017, with this now only a few days later as Delgado moves in. In the final scene, reference is given to Destiny Gonzalez's body being found on a beach, which occurs on December 9, 2017 (see other references). Assuming at least approximately 3 days for Mayhem/O'Reilly to pick up on the story and pass on the information to Bowen, and Bowen and Johnson to then decide to go, prepare, and leave, then this should be at least around December 12, 2017. Given the letter would suggest early December ideally, this earliest possible December 12, 2017 date can be taken for the ending of Level Bishop says to Kate Bishop, \"I still remember when you got your black belt at 15.\" With Kate's birth approximated to December 2002 (see [2000s](/wiki/2000s)references), it can be taken that she earned her black belt in either 2017 or 2018. [Black belt candidates tend to be tested in June or December](http://dojofairfield.com/black-belt-requirements/), meaning this happened in either December 2017 or June 2018. To avoid clashing with the date of the Snap, dated to May 31, 2018 (see [2018](/wiki/2018)references), it can be taken that she was tested in date to be [\"12-17-2017\"](https://imgur.com/gallery/KSRlS6p), making the episode set on December 16-19, 2017. This matches with Coulson's joke about \"tidings of comfort of joy\" in the episode suggesting it is Christmas-time, and the fact that it is set shortly after [The Real Deal](/wiki/The_Real_Deal), which takes place a little over \"24 hours\" after the end of Season 1, which was December 24, 2017 (see other references), making it December 25, 2017. The show then proceeds the following day, December 26, 2017. However, there is an undefined gap between Alex Wilder returning to the group with sleeping bags and burner phones and the group being woken by Mike on a Bike one morning soon after. While the group are in the same clothes, they do not have changes of clothes yet while they are on the run. The season continues from there, with the main events of Episode 4 - [Old School](/wiki/Old_School)3 days later said to be a \"Thursday\", and it is during the school term, making it at least Thursday, January 11, 2018 and thus the Mike on a Bike scene at least Monday, January 8, 2018, so minimum 13 days passing between Wilder returning to the group and Mike on a Bike turning up. this is a stretch, with it implied that the Mike on a Bike scene is very shortly after Wilder returning, but is just about possible. However, a further week - if Old School needed to be Thursday, January 18th instead, would be highly implausible, and any more weeks would be near-impossible. In Episode 5 - [Rock Bottom](/wiki/Rock_Bottom), the following day, Chase Stein and Wilder joke about their time since running away, and refer to \"one Thursday in there\". This suggests at least three Thursdays since their running away, which supports it being at least Friday, January 12, 2018 - and again, likely not much later. 2 days later, in Episode 7 - [Last Rites](/wiki/Last_Rites), Nico Minoru says that life was normal \"2 months ago\", making it currently between 1 and 2 months since December 8, 2017 (see other references), again supporting at least a 13-day span in that undefined break in [Gimmie Shelter](/wiki/Gimmie_Shelter)and making it at least Sunday, January 14, 2018, and definitely no later than Sunday, February 4, 2018 (which would involve a 34-day span in the Gimmie Shelter gap, nearly impossible). In Gimmie Shelter, Darius Davis says on December 26, 2017 that his son is due in \"2 weeks\". His wife Tamar leaves hospital with his son in [Past Life](/wiki/Past_Life_(Runaways)), approximately 9 days after the Mike on a Bike scene. Therefore, with that being no earlier than Monday, January 8, 2018 as established, this should be no earlier than roughly Wednesday, January 16, 2018, 3 weeks after Davis' comment. This is acceptable if you assume Davis was rounding down from a little over 2 weeks, and Tamar had to stay for a couple of days, but any later would not work. This confirms that the Mike on a Bike scene should be no later than Monday, January 8, 2018, as well as no earlier, which was confirmed above. In [Hostile Takeover](/wiki/Hostile_Takeover), it is said to be \"Wednesday\". However, it seems to only be about 8 days since Gert Yorkes stated in Old School that it was \"Thursday\". So, to make this work, 5 extra off-screen days need to pass in the time between Old School and Hostile Takeover, so have been added where possible, taking Hostile Takeover to Wednesday, January 24, 2018. The events of Season 2 following the Mike on a Bike scene in Gimmie Shelter therefore take place January 8-28, 2018. Scenes in Gimmie Shelter between Wilder returning to the group and Mike on a Bike are placed in the most appropriate dates between December 26, 2017 and January 8, 2018. In Past Life, Alex Wilder's phone says \"10/07/2018 01:54am\", but it is daytime so it is clearly incorrect anyway, and the date does not match with it being mere weeks since December 2017, as well as confirmation from Jeph Loeb that it is set before Avengers: Infinity War ( [1](https://www.reddit.com/r/marvelstudios/comments/8pbxyk/im_jeph_loeb_head_of_marvel_tv_ama/e0a5ju5/), [2](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9UqrlizXWIM&t=2015s)), so before May 2018. The song \"Bubblin\" by Anderson .Paak is also played in-universe in Past Life, suggesting it is at least May 2018, after the song's release, but this must also be taken as simply an error. Finally, Leslie Dean is shown to be a few months pregnant in the season. While this would imply a few months at least since Jonah was healed by Andre Compton's sacrifice, this is impossible, so it must be taken that either the baby was conceived at a time before Jonah had fallen into a fully scaled state, or the gestation period is faster due to being "}
